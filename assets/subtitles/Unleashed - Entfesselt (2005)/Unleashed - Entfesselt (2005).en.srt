1
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,417
Get 'em!

2
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:56,917
Danny!

3
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,833
Atta boy!

4
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:09,250
Borrow money from me,
you're expected to pay it back.

5
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,167
You pay it back, the collar stays on.

6
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,208
You don't pay it back,
the collar comes off.

7
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,792
It's a simple set of rules.

8
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:20,833
Give us your arm! Still! Shut up!

9
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,875
Behave! It's nice! We'll be back.
Come on, Danny boy.

10
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,375
I had a dream last night

11
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,583
I was sitting under those umbrellas

12
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,458
that they make out of palm leaves,
you know?

13
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:43,750
And these beautiful
golden skinned girls dressed in...

14
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,208
just, like, little grass skirts,
the skin that they was born in.

15
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,208
And they came over,
one after the other,

16
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,542
and they brought me
a drink in a coconut.

17
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:00,542
And as they served me the drink,
they brushed their tits across my face.

18
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,667
Cor, bloody hell...

19
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,542
Hey, boss, I think
Georgie's getting a chubby.

20
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,792
You shut up, Lefty! You're the one
getting a fucking hard on, not me!

21
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,208
Ah well,

22
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,250
that was the end of the best bits.

23
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:15,833
After the girls, the whole thing
turned to shit.

24
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,250
This giant mumpet turned up with a
machine gun and started blasting away

25
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:26,500
until there was nothing but blood
and guts and bits of body everywhere.

26
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,958
Nice one!

27
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,500
It was a real nightmare.

28
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:39,167
I bet you've never had a dream
in your life, have you?

29
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,583
Yeah, must be peaceful.

30
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:50,083
Here, have a bit of that.
That's it, that's it...

31
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,042
I hate dreams.

32
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,042
Georgie boy!

33
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,042
Lefty

34
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,417
Yo, Ricy, you mad bastard!

35
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,958
Ricy, how did you get on?

36
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,458
Hello, Guv'nor.
All my people paid to the penny.

37
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,667
Twenty seven hundred.

38
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,750
Perfect! Give the lads a drink.

39
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:06,792
Cheers, Guv'nor.

40
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:08,458
What do you want done with Danny?

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,417
Well, sort him out. His face is bleeding.
Sort him out.

42
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,917
Anybody have any trouble?

43
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,000
Put it on here.

44
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:20,958
Oh nice, look at this!

45
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,292
Come on Danny, you heard the guv'nor.

46
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,667
Here's a bonus. Alright?

47
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:32,500
Sort yourself out, OK?

48
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,333
Come on Danny.

49
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,542
Danny!

50
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,667
Come on!
Danny! Come on!

51
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,292
Here, give us a pose!

52
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:32,750
Oh yeah, beautiful! Yeah...

53
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,708
Oi! Get back in the car.

54
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,083
Fuckin' beast!

55
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,542
Fucking wanker!

56
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,750
I want to get closer.

57
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,958
That's it.

58
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,000
No, don't get your fingers on it.
Your monkey.

59
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,167
Give us it.

60
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,458
Oh, hello!

61
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,542
Look at him!

62
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,250
No, not here!

63
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:56,542
Yes, you're right.
Let's go somewhere more comfortable.

64
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,208
You're so rough!

65
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,167
Yeah... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

66
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:03,500
No...

67
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,708
Turn the light on!

68
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,458
No lights.

69
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,625
Turn on the lights!

70
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,542
I like to see you who I'm making love to.

71
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:15,500
I don't.

72
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,167
What the fuck... Shit!

73
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:24,167
Fuck!

74
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,292
Jesus! You sick bastard!

75
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,333
Oi! Oi! Where are you going?

76
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,667
Much obliged!

77
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,792
Fuckin'ell...

78
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,333
Atta boy!

79
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,208
No way, boss.

80
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,542
Hey, Nigel!

81
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,292
OK, Bart,

82
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,917
All right... You want this?

83
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,208
Turn it round, keep it running,
and keep your eye out for the old bill.

84
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,417
Good luck, son!

85
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,125
Luck? Don't need it, bruv!

86
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,042
You know what I have
always found fascinating

87
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,958
about this whole situation of yours,
Bart buddy?

88
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:54,167
How you basically
turned a man into a dog.

89
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,667
Well, it's like my sainted Mum
used to say.

90
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,708
Get 'em young enough
and the possibilities are endless.

91
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,042
Unlike yours at the moment.

92
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,667
So hmm...

93
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,750
So let me work this through
one more time.

94
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,375
I don't pay you, you take his collar off.

95
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,792
Correctimundo.

96
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:15,583
You take his collar off,
he beats us all to death,

97
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,500
Now, who's the bright penny?

98
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,708
So it's in my best interest
to keep that collar on.

99
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,708
Danny!

100
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,958
Kill him!

101
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:33,958
Danny! Kill him! Danny!

102
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,458
When you're finished with the master,

103
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:44,917
kill the dog.

104
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,625
You fuckin' bastard!

105
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,833
Good to see you Mr. Yussef.

106
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,083
You fucker!

107
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,292
Kill!

108
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,000
Find anything to you like yet?

109
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:19,375
Not yet.

110
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:29,417
Stop him!!!

111
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,625
Nice puppy.

112
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,625
Atta boy!

113
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,208
I don't know what it is with people...

114
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,125
Maybe I've got a speech deficiency.

115
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,375
Take what you want...

116
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,042
Oh, no. My mum didn't
bring me up to be a pig.

117
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:21,208
Not like some people I know.
I only take what I'm owed.

118
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,792
But this time...

119
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:26,458
Yeah...

120
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,417
With a little interest.

121
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,667
Because you are...
Such a fucking Arsehole!!!

122
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,375
Asshole?

123
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,083
Come on.

124
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,208
What are you looking at?

125
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,083
Just enjoying the show.

126
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,625
Good.

127
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,333
Don't you ever leave my sight again!

128
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,417
You said "stay in the car".

129
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,792
Shut the fuck up!

130
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,125
Get in, you bitch!

131
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,708
I don't believe it!

132
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,500
He just stood there and watched them
beat the crap out of me!

133
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:22,125
Even a dog has got the brains
to come to his master's defense!

134
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,750
Bite'em! Claw'em! Piss on 'em!

135
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,875
Anything for fuck's sake! Jesus!

136
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,875
Jesus, boss, you don't look too good.

137
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,917
Another original thinker.

138
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,625
No, I just meant that maybe
you might want to go home.

139
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,458
What's next?

140
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,750
Just the antiques place.

141
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:39,792
No, let's do it.

142
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,042
Are you sure you're up to this?

143
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,500
No, no, you let one
of them payments slide

144
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,792
and they'll all turn into original thinkers.

145
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,417
Find a decent pub first,
though, I want a pint.

146
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,917
And you, you useless piece of shit!

147
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,667
Right... Now... Here's the plan.

148
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,833
I'm going to try and settle this
in a peaceful and professional manner.

149
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,625
But if that doesn't work,
I'm gonna press this...

150
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,042
Oi! Oi!!

151
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,292
You pay attention!

152
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:31,125
When I press this button, this red light
is gonna start blinking. Right?

153
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:34,125
The red light blinks,
you go through that door

154
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,250
quicker than a mouse
chasing a bit of cheese.

155
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:40,042
Keep your hands off him, will you?
And stop fucking smirking!

156
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,250
The red light blinks... Look at me!

157
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:45,333
Concentrate! The red light blinks,
you go through the door.

158
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,167
That's all you gotta remember. Right?

159
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,958
Light. Door

160
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,500
Light. Door.

161
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,083
Light. Door.

162
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:58,000
Oi! Right... And don't take your eyes
off the light. And don't let me down.

163
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,083
Georgie!

164
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:00,875
Yes, Bart.

165
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:01,917
Hang that up there.

166
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:02,625
Up there?

167
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:09,875
All right.

168
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,625
The light, Danny, the light.

169
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,167
Red means go. Right?

170
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,583
Ay ay ay ay ay!

171
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,750
Sounds like someone in here
could use my help!

172
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,375
Hi, how you doing?

173
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,167
I'm just gonna tune these pianos.

174
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,250
Probably be a couple of hours.

175
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,042
If you don't mind.

176
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,875
You like pianos?

177
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, me too.

178
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:39,583
This whole place is like...
it's like a big treasure chest.

179
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:44,625
Probably gonna be a whole month
getting all these ladies back into health.

180
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,125
You know tuning pianos
is really hard work

181
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,375
and my back isn't what it used to be.

182
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,792
Are you... Are you doing
anything important right now?

183
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:57,917
Cause I could really use a hand here.
How about it?

184
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,083
Please.

185
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,750
Are you still there?

186
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,875
You are, aren't you?

187
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,792
Yes.

188
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,917
Good, good,

189
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,000
come on!

190
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:30,542
You know a lot of people think because
a piano's so big, it is very strong

191
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,500
and you can just pound it any way
you want to and nothing will happen,

192
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,042
but that's not so at all.

193
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:39,083
Pianos are a lot like people.
I mean, you pound on a person,

194
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:44,417
they get out of tune. Same with a piano.
You pound on 'em and...

195
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,375
Lordy, listen to that.
Sad as a baby crying.

196
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,708
I tell you what I want you to do now.

197
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:54,000
When I say press,
I want you to press on this key.

198
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,667
Starting with this one right here
and going to the right.

199
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,625
One, then two, then three.

200
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,208
Think you can do that?

201
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,042
OK. Put your hand here, just like that.

202
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,708
Right there.

203
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,042
Oh oh my goodness.

204
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,958
Oh wait a minute.
Loosen up. Loosen up.

205
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,375
Music's got to flow from within, y'know.

206
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,375
Can't flow if you're all stiff.

207
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,583
On the key there. Just relax.

208
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,208
Nothing to be afraid of.

209
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,375
There we are. Are you ready?

210
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,708
And press.

211
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,625
Little harder.

212
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,375
Good! Again.

213
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,458
Good. Listen,

214
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,000
you show a real talent
for this sort of work.

215
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,083
OK,

216
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,250
press it again.

217
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,750
Press.

218
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,792
Oh wonderful.

219
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,542
And one more time.

220
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,750
Ready?

221
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,292
Press, press,

222
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,500
go ahead relax.

223
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,708
Let the energy flow.

224
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,583
Let the magic happen.

225
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,083
Good, good, good, good...

226
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,375
Excellent, excellent!

227
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,583
Wait, wait! Hold on! Now...

228
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,083
You want to see what you did?

229
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:12,708
Yes.

230
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:13,958
Check this out.

231
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,667
That the sweetest sound or what?

232
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,250
Yes.

233
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,792
Want to try it?

234
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,125
Here, c'mon. Put your hand here.

235
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,167
Put your fingers right there.
There. Right there.

236
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,875
Hit it.

237
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,417
Next stop Carnegie Hall.

238
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,250
You know about Carnegie hall?

239
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,833
It's this big place in New York City.

240
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:41,917
All the great musicians
want to play Carnegie Hall.

241
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,708
I did too.

242
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,125
When I was growing up,
it was my big ambition.

243
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,917
But I never was that good a musician.

244
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,500
Are you OK?

245
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:00,333
Yes

246
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,792
Good.

247
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,208
What's your name?

248
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,292
OK. Alright, alright.

249
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,583
Mister No Name.

250
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,500
My name is Sam.

251
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,625
Pleased to meet you.

252
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,583
Me too.

253
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,750
Good, that's good.

254
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,583
So tell me something, Mr. No Name,

255
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,042
am I hearing a sort of clicking sound?

256
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,708
Do you hear it? Or is it...

257
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm gonna sell you,
is what I'm gonna do!

258
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,208
If you can't do what I've trained you
to do, what fucking use are you?

259
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:05,375
No fucking use is the answer!
No fucking use at all!

260
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,667
I feed you! I clothe you!
I put a roof over your head!

261
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:13,500
And all that time I put in.
All the fucking effort!

262
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,917
To make you the man that you are...

263
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,625
And what gratitude do I get!
Look at me!

264
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:22,917
I look as if I've just been through
the third fucking world war.

265
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,542
Take him downstairs,
get him out of my sight.

266
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,000
C'mon, c'mon.

267
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,042
I'm getting too old for this shit.

268
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,042
All right, Danny. Get in! Get in!

269
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,083
I'm busy!

270
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,542
I said get in there.

271
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:37,875
There's a man here to see you.

272
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,792
I just told you I'm busy!

273
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,917
He says he's got
a business proposition for us.

274
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,750
He says it's about the show
you put on today.

275
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,167
Pat him down.

276
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,208
Already did.

277
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,167
All right, wheel him in.

278
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,250
Receiving fucking visitors
looking like this. It's a joke.

279
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,750
Shit, Jesus! Fuckin'ell!

280
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm listening.

281
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,292
That was a very impressive display

282
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,292
your man put on
in the jewelry shop today.

283
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,667
I assure you, it was entirely justified.

284
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,208
I'm sure it was.

285
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,750
That thing with the collar. Brilliant.

286
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,750
And the point of this conversation is?

287
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:35,458
The point of this conversation is, I'd like
to offer you a lucrative proposition.

288
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,000
How lucrative?

289
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:41,042
Very lucrative. Should I continue?

290
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,250
Please...

291
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,917
It's an entertainment I produce
for some friends once a month.

292
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,708
Members only, so to speak.

293
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:52,125
What?

294
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,208
And we're always on the lookout
for new talent.

295
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,125
The first fight is a tryout.
For that, you get fifteen thousand.

296
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,875
For the second twenty,
plus the right to bet.

297
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:02,833
We had one chap

298
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,708
who after fees and betting on himself
got up to half a million a fight.

299
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,875
That's only if you win, of course.

300
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,333
But how do you get to win?

301
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:12,750
It's to the death.

302
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,667
So glad you could make it.

303
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,000
Please follow me.

304
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,042
Where's the money?

305
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,125
Oh well, the money comes after.

306
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,708
After what?

307
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,833
After you beat him,
our current champion.

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,458
Undefeated in fifteen bouts.

309
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,042
Care for a glass of champagne?

310
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,792
We won't be here that long.

311
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,458
Kill him.

312
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,250
Rip his fucking hat off!

313
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,417
That's my boy!

314
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,125
Thanks for the opportunity.
You're most welcome. Very impressive.

315
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:24,708
That bit with the collar.
How did you do that?

316
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,750
Like my saint of a mum used to say:

317
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,375
Get 'em young and
the possibilities are endless.

318
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,667
I thought it was the Jesuits
who said that.

319
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,792
Probably got it from my mum.

320
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,958
If you want us back
you do know where to find me.

321
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,542
Oh we certainly want you back.

322
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:44,500
Only, if you could make it a little more
... entertaining... next time.

323
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,125
I'll see what I can do.

324
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,458
Here, remember I told you
about that dream I had?

325
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,833
What? The one with
the all the birds in it?

326
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:08,458
Yeah.

327
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:08,958
Yeah.

328
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,208
Well, I figured it all out.
D'you know who Freud is?

329
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:12,875
No.

330
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,042
Well that doesn't matter.
Freud was a genius

331
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,625
and his whole thing was
if you dream something

332
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,042
it means something else.

333
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:25,375
Like the girls, the island, the drink.
They were just symbols.

334
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:29,958
What they actually represented
was like comfort, relaxation,

335
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,208
no worries.

336
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,458
And then this swell turns up offering us

337
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,000
more money than
we could save in 20 years.

338
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:39,083
Well, it all becomes clear.

339
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:42,625
The dream. The swell.
It means retirement, you get it?

340
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,833
Yeah, right.

341
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,417
No more filthy collections,
no more beatings.

342
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:53,333
I tell you, I feel really good here.

343
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,125
I feel generous.

344
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,833
Danny, what do you want?

345
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,708
A piano.

346
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:01,167
Excuse me?

347
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,708
I want a piano.

348
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:08,750
A piano. Yeah, leave off.
How about a lobster dinner?

349
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,583
I want a piano.

350
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,917
How about a woman?
You've never had a woman.

351
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,917
I want a piano.

352
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,917
Danny, you're starting to piss me off.

353
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,667
I want a piano.

354
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,125
That's what I love about you, Danny.

355
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,750
One thought at a time.

356
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,833
That's what makes us
such a good team.

357
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,833
The brains and the brawn.

358
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,667
I tell you this is gonna be one lovely day!

359
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,167
Let's go.

360
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,917
Good morning Ladies,

361
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:34,583
how are we all this morning?

362
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,125
Ah, here you are.

363
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,042
You've been very patient,
waiting for me, Madam.

364
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,042
So I'm going to devote myself
to you all day.

365
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,917
Who's there? It's you, isn't it?

366
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,458
Yes.

367
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,333
Well, isn't that something?

368
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:12,625
You know, I went right home and
I told Victoria, my step-daughter...

369
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,958
I told Victoria all about you.

370
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,917
Hello?

371
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,750
Don't tell me you're still asleep.

372
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,417
Well now...

373
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:24,375
If I was a fella who woke up
in a strange house

374
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:29,333
wearing someone else's pajamas,
I would be pretty nervous.

375
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:34,000
I'd try to find the safest place
I could to hide.

376
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,792
Now, when I was a kid, the safest place
in the whole wide world was...

377
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,792
Right where you are.

378
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,708
It does feel safe, doesn't it?

379
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:50,250
Well, I figured a man who'd been out for
two days would wake up pretty hungry.

380
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:54,583
So, I hope you like
peanut butter and jelly.

381
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,417
My name is Sam, remember?

382
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,708
OK you take your time.

383
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:04,083
Victoria and I are not big
on asking questions.

384
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:10,167
Figure when the person is ready,
they'll give their answers. OK?

385
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:16,958
OK.

386
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,333
Hi!

387
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:25,958
He's cute!

388
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:26,750
Really?

389
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,542
I like his haircut it's like when I was six
and used to cut my own hair.

390
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,417
Yeah, well...

391
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,625
You and Mom thought it was cute.

392
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:33,500
He's not six.

393
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,708
More is than not, I bet.

394
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,083
Does he like to read?

395
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,208
Well I don't know.

396
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,833
Does he like to write?
Does he like to draw?

397
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,125
Sweetie, I don't know
anything about him.

398
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,667
Well, that's not altogether so.
He likes music.

399
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,458
Cool.

400
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,375
Hi!

401
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,375
Sam said you like music.

402
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,458
You know how to use it?

403
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,333
See...

404
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:08,667
Nice, huh?

405
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,125
It was my Dad's.

406
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,792
He died before I was born and then
my mom gave it to me.

407
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,167
But she died in a car accident.
But not until after she married Sam.

408
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,958
He was my dad's best friend.

409
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,875
Am I talking too much? You know
because I do that some times.

410
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,292
And if you're bored listening and
I just keep going on and on,

411
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,708
you just tell me, OK?

412
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:29,375
I'm gonna go help Sam with dinner.

413
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,458
You can join us if you'd like.
Or you can eat under here.

414
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:36,125
It's just the food goes down easier
if you eat it sitting up.

415
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,500
You don't burp so much.

416
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,875
My name's Victoria.

417
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,417
Should I go get him?

418
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,375
No, let's let him get himself.

419
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,167
Maybe he doesn't know how.

420
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,167
Well, then let's just give him
the opportunity to learn.

421
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:13,542
There's nothing like self-discovery
for turning a boy into a man.

422
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,125
How do you know?
You never had a boy.

423
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,833
I was speaking from self experience,
if you don't mind.

424
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:19,292
I was a boy myself once, you know.

425
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,167
No way.

426
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:23,792
Yes, way. Come on.

427
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,917
Thank you for the food
we are about to eat.

428
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,542
Thank you for peace
this house possesses.

429
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,000
Thank you for another day
of health and happiness.

430
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:37,375
And please make sure Victoria
kicks butt on her piano recital.

431
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,417
I thought we're not supposed
to ask for things.

432
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,000
Says who?

433
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,167
Says you. Since I was a little girl
you told me those are the rules.

434
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,667
You mean I didn't tell you about

435
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,125
the special exemption for
very Important Piano Recitals?

436
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,958
Oh yeah right. Exemptions.
I buy that... Not.

437
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:55,375
You know I liked it better when you
just agreed with everything I said.

438
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,708
How about some soup?

439
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,083
Well, you're just in time.

440
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:05,958
This is your place.

441
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,125
Come on, sit down.

442
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,833
Victoria would you...

443
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,125
Sure. Sam made this. It's his
world famous potato and leek soup.

444
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,583
World famous.

445
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,833
There's your napkin.

446
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,292
Bread?

447
00:35:56,042 --> 00:36:05,250
Oh no! This is a spoon. And this...
... is your spoon. Like this...

448
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,042
Oh my...

449
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:34,042
Oh, great! A duet.

450
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,542
My name is Danny.

451
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:01,000
I think we won't put a bandage back on
and we'll let some air get to this.

452
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,458
You're gonna be just fine.

453
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,833
I've been meaning to ask you.

454
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,292
What is this?

455
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,333
OK. No problem.

456
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,583
I wasn't going to take it off.

457
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,792
Y'know, when I was a kid
I had a cowboy hat.

458
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:22,458
I slept in it, I ate in it, I bathed in it.

459
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,083
Anybody tried to take it off,
I had the same reaction.

460
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,208
So...

461
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:32,375
Anyway, I've been thinking. You been
cooped up in here for weeks now.

462
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,458
Would you like to get some fresh air?

463
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:37,625
Stretch your legs?

464
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,500
It's nice outside.

465
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,833
It's nice in here.

466
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:46,625
You're afraid that if you go out
you won't be able to come back in?

467
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:51,542
We'll come back. Promise.

468
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,042
OK...

469
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,042
Alright, we'll be back to get you
at 3 o'clock.

470
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,167
I am 18, Sam.

471
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,583
Yeah, for a whole week and a half.

472
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:08,958
Don't worry.

473
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:09,417
3 o'clock.

474
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:09,792
Bye

475
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,542
Bye

476
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,208
Bye

477
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,375
You all right?

478
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:18,833
She kissed me.

479
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,833
Yeah, I know, she does that.
How was it?

480
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,042
Wet.

481
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,167
Is that all?

482
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,583
Nice.

483
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,458
Wet. Nice.

484
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,708
Sounds like what a kiss
ought to feel like.

485
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,208
Come on, we've got a lot to do.

486
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:43,000
- Hello, luv. Love.
- Good morning Maddy.

487
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,500
Maddy runs the best supermarket
in all of Glasgow.

488
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,292
Maddy, this is Danny.

489
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,458
Hello, Danny.

490
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:53,292
- He's a little shy.
- I like my men to be shy.

491
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,333
Presents a challenge for a girl.

492
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,917
I'm just going give him some
of the finer points of shopping.

493
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,958
Couldn't have a better teacher.

494
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:05,083
My mother could take two stones
and a cup of water

495
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,083
and make a three course meal.

496
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,292
As soon as I was old enough, she gave
me the secret to great cooking.

497
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,000
And now I'm going to teach it to you.

498
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,458
So, you ready to learn the secret
to great cooking?

499
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,042
Yes.

500
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,708
OK, here it is.

501
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,958
Food talks.

502
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,250
Food talks?

503
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,833
Didn't know that, did you?

504
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,250
No

505
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,667
Food talks.

506
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:28,417
It will tell you everything
you need to know.

507
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,042
All you have to do is learn the language.

508
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:33,792
Take this melon here for instance, now.

509
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,375
What do you think that's saying?

510
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,708
Yeah, but it's also saying "I am ripe".

511
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:47,375
You know what ripe means, don't you?

512
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,417
No.

513
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,417
Ripe means sweet.
And sweet means good.

514
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,042
The kiss was ripe.

515
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:00,333
No, no. The kiss was sweet.

516
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,208
The melon is ripe.

517
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,125
But ripe means sweet.

518
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:08,625
Well, when you're talking about food.

519
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:11,667
Kisses are nourishing in their own way
but kisses are...

520
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,833
Kisses are complicated. For now,
let's just stick to melons.

521
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,000
You go ahead, you try it.

522
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,250
And don't forget, use the language.

523
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,917
Oh, okay. How was that sound?

524
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:31,958
It's ripe.

525
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,458
OK, ripe means?

526
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,792
Ripe is sweet.

527
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:37,667
And sweet means?

528
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,458
Sweet means good.

529
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:44,167
Alright! My man!
Put it up there!

530
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,292
Thank you.

531
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:55,583
This is the cone and
this is the ice cream.

532
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:57,958
You ever have ice cream before?

533
00:40:58,708 --> 00:40:59,458
No.

534
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,917
Well, this is vanilla ice cream.
Vanilla's white.

535
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,917
Vanilla is white.

536
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:06,542
Go on, taste it.

537
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:21,833
Oh no, just work it around.
Work it around.

538
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,167
Oh my god!

539
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:29,000
You know the thing about ice cream
is first it's cold, but then it's sweet

540
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,208
and if you freeze your mouth out,

541
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:34,167
you're never gonna be able
to taste the sweet part.

542
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,708
So look here's how you do it...

543
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:36,792
Sweet is good.

544
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,125
Yeah right. So look. You lick...

545
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,958
Like that...

546
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,083
There you go.

547
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,042
How's that?

548
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,875
Look, you're getting it everywhere!

549
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,958
Shit, actually, we should really hurry.

550
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:04,417
Come on.

551
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:06,708
You OK?

552
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:07,875
Yeah.

553
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,958
Finish it quickly.

554
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,833
Remember, if Sam asks where
we were, you let me do the talking.

555
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,292
If he knows we had ice cream
before dinner,

556
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,625
he'll be pissed we ruined our appetite.
Understand?

557
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:20,417
What's "appetite"?

558
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,292
Appetite's what you have if you don't
have a belly full of ice cream.

559
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,583
How's my mouth?

560
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,000
Nice.

561
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,292
No it's not. It's full of hardware.
But not for much longer.

562
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,167
Do you miss your mom?

563
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:38,083
Everyday. You miss your mom?

564
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,667
I don't remember my mom.

565
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,458
Sometimes I think it'd be easier
not to remember.

566
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,000
Hi

567
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,667
You're late...

568
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:56,458
It was so nice out we decided
to walk the long way.

569
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:57,875
Oh you deci...

570
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,708
Didn't I say bring her straight home?

571
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,333
Sam, it was me. Not him.

572
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,708
Oh, it was...

573
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,250
If you wanted to take
the long way home,

574
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,250
Victoria, you could have gone
to that school in Kansas.

575
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:11,875
Then you could have taken the long way
home for fifty miles and I wouldn't care.

576
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:13,208
Fifty miles of corn.

577
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:14,208
Corn is safe.

578
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,750
Corn is boring. And anyway
this was the better school.

579
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:20,250
Which is why we're here and
not with the corn, right?

580
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:23,917
So do me a favor, huh,
don't make me worry.

581
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,500
OK, Sam.

582
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,375
What is that?

583
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:31,417
What?

584
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,667
Smells like ice cream.
Vanilla ice cream.

585
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,333
Vanilla is white.

586
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,333
First it's cold.

587
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:39,833
Then it's sweet.

588
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,042
Sweet is good.

589
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,375
Victoria?

590
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,250
Yeah?

591
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:07,417
Sometimes, I worry about that boy.

592
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,292
It's as if something or someone
has made him

593
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,833
shut down his feelings so hard,
he can no longer get in touch with them.

594
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,500
That's what I've been
trying to get him to do.

595
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,125
With vanilla ice cream?

596
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:24,500
Maybe we should come up
with some different strategies.

597
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:26,792
Goodnight.

598
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
'Night.

599
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:45,042
C 'mon, but shhhh...

600
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:55,542
When I was little I used to do this
with my mom and Sam.

601
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,083
It's kinda how I fell in love with music.

602
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,625
See these thingies?

603
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:01,333
They're called notes.

604
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,167
Notes.

605
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:06,958
OK. Notes are signals.

606
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,458
Notes are signals.

607
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,625
OK.

608
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,042
Notes are signals.

609
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,750
So if you see this note,

610
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,333
it's the signal to play this key.

611
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:20,667
And this one,

612
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,417
this key.

613
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,583
And this one, this key.

614
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:34,208
Right. So you're gonna play
and you're gonna hop...

615
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,542
Great!

616
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,083
Ready?

617
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,417
I'm gonna go.

618
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:57,000
Keep going don't stop.

619
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,458
Not ripe.

620
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:30,667
Hello, Sam.

621
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:31,542
Hi, Maddy.

622
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,667
How's the lessons going?

623
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:36,125
Oh, he's growing by leaps and bounds.
What is this you got here? Is this...?

624
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:37,750
Too ripe.

625
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:38,917
Hey, get back here!

626
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:42,167
Get back here!
C'mere! C'mere! C'mere!

627
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,125
Alex, go the other side quick!

628
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:49,958
Get back here, you bastard!

629
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,500
Alex, other side!

630
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:58,917
Where's Danny? Danny!

631
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:01,750
That's ripe!

632
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,125
Danny!

633
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,333
This one's ripe.

634
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,000
Danny, do you remember

635
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:20,083
when I said that Victoria and I were
not big on asking questions,

636
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:22,958
that we thought when people were
ready they'd give their own answers?

637
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:24,042
I remember.

638
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:26,792
After today in the supermarket,

639
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:28,792
I need some answers,

640
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:31,667
and I don't think I'm going to get them
without asking the questions.

641
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,667
Is that alright?

642
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,083
OK.

643
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:39,458
Ok, so... In the market those men,
they were fighting.

644
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:40,500
You knew that, right?

645
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:41,542
Yes.

646
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,000
But that didn't bother you?

647
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:43,792
No.

648
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,625
You weren't afraid?

649
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:45,500
No.

650
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:51,208
Normally people find themselves
in situations like that, they get afraid.

651
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,792
They weren't fighting me.

652
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:56,167
OK. One more question.

653
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,667
When you first came to us,
you were hurt pretty bad.

654
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,083
How did that happen?

655
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,917
I asked for a piano.

656
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,958
You asked who for a piano?

657
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:08,833
My uncle.

658
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,958
Oh, you do have family?

659
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:12,417
No.

660
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,625
But you just said you had an uncle.

661
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:15,708
He's dead.

662
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:19,500
Oh...

663
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:21,833
Is this good?

664
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:24,042
That's wonderful.

665
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:41,500
OK, ready? God!

666
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,333
You're acting ridiculous. It's not so bad.

667
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:06,208
That looks like it belongs there.

668
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:07,708
Where is it?

669
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:08,875
It's right there.

670
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,458
Oh yes! It belongs there.

671
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,208
Hi. Can I come in?

672
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:26,542
OK.

673
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:29,833
Where'd you learn that?

674
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:30,833
Learn what?

675
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,000
The piece of music you just played?

676
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,250
It's what I hear in my head.

677
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:37,958
Do it again.

678
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,875
It's hard. Someone had
to teach it to you.

679
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,000
You don't remember?

680
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:51,500
No.

681
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,875
Maybe in your other life.
The one you had before us.

682
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,292
I don't know.

683
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,667
Everything is new about you now.

684
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:01,833
Your clothes, your hair, your whole life.

685
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,875
This is the last...

686
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:12,417
I think it's time to put the last thing away.
Don't you?

687
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,000
Everything is new about you now.

688
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,750
Goodnight.

689
00:52:58,417 --> 00:53:00,167
Oh yes.

690
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:05,167
My boy, we're going to have fun.

691
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,917
That's good, that's good.

692
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,083
Alrighty then.

693
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:24,292
You know Victoria's big recital
is next month, right?

694
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:28,583
D'you remember me telling you about
where I grew up? In New York City?

695
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,250
Carnegie Hall!

696
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:36,750
Yeah, well, that's where Victoria
and I are from. That's our home.

697
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,083
This is your home.

698
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:41,083
No, no, this is just a temporary home.

699
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,708
We only came here so Victoria
could attend school.

700
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:49,458
What I'm trying to say, Danny, is...

701
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,708
After Victoria graduates,
we're gonna go back home.

702
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,042
We're gonna go back to New York.

703
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:04,875
And I don't know how
this would work out but...

704
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:08,333
We would really like for you
to come with us

705
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:13,750
because we've begun to think
of you as family and,

706
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,083
well, that's what families do.

707
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,625
They stick together.

708
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,500
Or at least this one does.

709
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:26,417
So what do you say?

710
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:43,750
2, 3, 4, 5... This is your pay.

711
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:48,750
Fifty-fifty. Partners. You and me.

712
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,583
Happy?

713
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:53,875
What do I do with it?

714
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,917
Anything you want.

715
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,042
Fuck's sake, man!

716
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,500
Danny!

717
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:26,708
Alright, Danny, look at you!
You look great, man!

718
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:30,583
Look at... You smell divine, pal, I tell ya!

719
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,000
I don't know what you're wearing.

720
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,583
Well, fancy bumping into you, eh.

721
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:37,042
Boss sends me out.
Get some mangos and papayas

722
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:44,125
and look what I find instead.
A lemon. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

723
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:47,792
Your uncle Bart has been
sick with worry, mate.

724
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,667
Yeah! His little pet all lost in the world.

725
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,500
It's all he keeps
on talking about, honestly.

726
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,042
"Where's my Little Danny?"

727
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:55,083
He's dead.

728
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,042
Who told you that?

729
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:56,792
I saw.

730
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,792
Well, you saw wrong, mate,
because he's very, very much alive.

731
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,167
And very much looking forward
to you coming home.

732
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,542
Not my home anymore.

733
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:05,917
Not my home anymore.

734
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,500
Not my home anymore. Why?

735
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:11,292
You got a new home, have you,
Danny? Eh?

736
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:15,292
Oooh, hey! You got
a new family as well?

737
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,500
I tell you what,

738
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,458
if you don't come home
like a good little bitch,

739
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:26,000
Uncle Bart will send a few of the boys
out to pay a visit to your new home?

740
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,625
Would you like that?
Wouldn't be too hard to find,

741
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,708
what with you shopping here and all.

742
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,833
Look who's come home
to his loving Uncle Bart!

743
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:40,625
Give me a hug.

744
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,458
How's my boy? You're looking smart.

745
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:48,917
Oh, look at her! Ragner the prat!

746
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,500
We've missed you around here,
haven't we?

747
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,167
Yeah, we've definitely
missed you, Danny.

748
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:57,125
Must've really scared you,
that accident, all that shooting.

749
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,375
Yeah, me too.

750
00:56:58,583 --> 00:56:59,958
Look at me.

751
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,083
I've been laid up for a month.

752
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:05,250
But I'm back.

753
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:06,917
And I'm ready to roll.

754
00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:08,333
You ready to roll?

755
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,417
I have a question.

756
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:14,833
You? A question?

757
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:19,125
Wonders never cease. It's not about
that bleedin' piano again, is it?

758
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:19,958
No.

759
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:25,583
Listen, as I'm so pleased
to have you home,

760
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:29,958
I'll answer one question.
Go on, fire away.

761
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,792
Did you know my mom?

762
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:36,417
Your mum?

763
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,583
Why would I know your mum?

764
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,458
I found you in the street.

765
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:43,833
Laying on the pavement.

766
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:49,375
You was half dead, you couldn't
even talk. You was just laying there.

767
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,250
No one wanting you,

768
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,458
no one caring whether you lived or died.

769
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,125
Except me.

770
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,958
I've told you all this before, remember?

771
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:07,833
All right, listen. I'll show you stuff
that'll jog your memory.

772
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
That was our first collaboration,
that was.

773
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:21,250
Danny, what's this sudden
fascination with the past?

774
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,250
Have you been talking to people?

775
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:27,917
No.

776
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:36,250
You want some good advice
from your Uncle Bart, eh?

777
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:40,542
Don't dwell on the past.

778
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,292
Look to the future.

779
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:52,125
The past is behind you.
The future is ahead of you.

780
00:58:52,917 --> 00:58:57,083
Like a bright glittering mountain of gold.

781
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,917
You wanna know
what your future is, Danny?

782
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,708
I'm thrilled you're here.

783
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:08,625
We've been waiting for you.

784
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:12,167
Has our friend been practicing on you?

785
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:13,250
Had an accident.

786
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:14,292
Right this way.

787
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,292
Show's about to start. How's our boy?

788
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:19,625
He has never been better.

789
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:22,958
I hope so. Because he certainly has
his work cut out for him tonight.

790
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:24,667
I've dressed him in his Sunday best.

791
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:33,083
We are expecting more
of a show this time.

792
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:34,750
Well, don't worry about it.

793
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,375
We've got it all worked out.

794
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:37,750
Haven't we Danny?

795
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:40,583
Kill him! Kill him!

796
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,000
Get him out!

797
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:16,500
Listen! Give these toffs a bit of a show.

798
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,000
Play him for a bit.

799
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:22,458
Make it look as if there might be
a chance you could loose.

800
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:23,542
Gentlemen!

801
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,083
Got it?

802
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,625
To the death!

803
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:31,958
Right, down you go!

804
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:35,625
What's wrong with you?

805
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,958
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

806
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,458
Excuse me?

807
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:43,542
Danny, that's what you do.
You hurt people.

808
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:45,167
Not anymore.

809
01:00:45,292 --> 01:00:47,042
What the hell's happened to you?

810
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:49,708
Who's been filling your head
with this crap?

811
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:51,750
Anything wrong, gentlemen?

812
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:56,833
No, no, no, we're fine. No, just...
Just discussing strategy.

813
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,042
Of course.

814
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,083
Listen to me, you little shit.

815
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:03,333
You're gonna get down there
and you're gonna do your job

816
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,625
or I'm gonna have your balls on a stick!

817
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:06,750
Now, go!

818
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,667
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

819
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:16,583
I'll make you a deal. If you go down
there tonight and do your job,

820
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:18,625
I promise you, tomorrow,

821
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:24,292
I will buy you the nicest piano
in the whole bleeding city.

822
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:25,917
How's that?

823
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,875
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

824
01:01:28,042 --> 01:01:29,083
Then you're dead.

825
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:05,583
Go get him Tiger!

826
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,792
Come on! Come on! Danny, come on!

827
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,583
What's going on?

828
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:34,417
Well, you said you wanted it
to be more of an entertainment.

829
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,042
But he's not even fighting back.

830
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:50,667
Pick it up!

831
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:55,083
Use it! Danny!

832
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:14,792
Danny!

833
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:25,917
I think we have a problem here.

834
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:26,750
What?

835
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:30,042
These people came to see a fight,
not a bloody game of tag.

836
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,458
Do you mind if I get a little creative
with the format?

837
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:38,000
It's your show.

838
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,875
Danny, you're ruining me here!

839
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:31,083
It's time to make some money.

840
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,958
Danny, you're gonna get killed!

841
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:35,417
Fight back!

842
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,542
Danny!

843
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,000
Weapons!!

844
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,583
Kill him!

845
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:24,125
If you don't kill him, I don't get paid.

846
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,625
Kill him, for Christ's sake!

847
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:32,083
Come on!

848
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:36,208
Or they'll kill me! Kill him!

849
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,208
Fuck it!

850
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:50,792
No more killing!

851
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,625
I decide when there's
no more killing! I! Me!

852
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,042
The master commands
and the dog obeys!

853
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,917
I will kill you!

854
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:04,125
Put him to bed.

855
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,583
Why'd he leave?

856
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,792
Maybe he had some things to do.

857
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,750
But I thought he was happy here.

858
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:36,542
Well, sweetie, sometimes
being happy just isn't enough.

859
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,542
Sometimes people have
to go back and fix the things

860
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,083
that made them unhappy
before they were happy.

861
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:44,125
But I could help him.

862
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,458
I know.

863
01:07:48,292 --> 01:07:51,083
Sometimes people have
to do things themselves.

864
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:26,958
You lied to me!

865
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:29,542
Ow, you bastard!

866
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:33,167
What are you doing in my fucking chair,
you little retard?

867
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:34,417
You lied to me!

868
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:38,667
This is my mother.
You knew my mother!

869
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:41,042
She was a whore.

870
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:43,833
Do you know what a whore is, Danny?

871
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:45,708
Money for sex.

872
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,708
Like the girls I bring here.

873
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,583
I did everything I could to help her...

874
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:57,750
I liked your mum. She understood me.

875
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,875
If there'd ever been anybody really
special, it would have been her.

876
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:09,458
When she died, I felt
I owed it to her to raise you.

877
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:11,500
To protect you.

878
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:14,083
Look, her picture's here.

879
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,542
Look...

880
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:30,500
I'm sorry if I lied to you, Danny.

881
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,833
It was out of love.

882
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:40,917
Now, let's go and make up
some of that money

883
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:43,833
you lost for me the other night. Right?

884
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:49,750
You know, Danny,

885
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,375
sometimes

886
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:58,458
in families you need a little tragedy
just to bring everybody back together.

887
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:01,833
Absolutely, boss. Y'know, it's like me
and me brother in Blackpool.

888
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:03,083
We used to go down the beach every...

889
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,333
Excuse me! Like where's the manners?
I'm talking!

890
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:06,458
I was just validating, boss!

891
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:07,833
Did I ask for a validation?

892
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:08,750
No but I thought, y'know...

893
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,792
Will you shut your yap?

894
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:15,542
Now, I've lost the train of me thought.
What was I saying?

895
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:16,417
Families.

896
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:18,000
Right. Right, yeah.

897
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,542
How they should be together.

898
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:20,708
Exactly.

899
01:11:20,917 --> 01:11:23,000
Families should be together.

900
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:23,958
No matter what.

901
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:25,833
No matter what.

902
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,417
Danny! What the fuck are you doing?

903
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,208
Slow down bastard

904
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:41,958
Get off. Jesus, boss!

905
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:43,125
My mother. She was a whore.

906
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,833
Look... Not that I'm an expert, but I
have to say, she does not look like,

907
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:53,042
y'know, that kind of woman.

908
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,833
What does that mean?

909
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:56,917
Well, she's playing the piano.

910
01:12:58,042 --> 01:12:59,625
What else is in the photo?

911
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:03,125
There's a bunch of students in uniform.

912
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:05,583
There's a big stained glass window.

913
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,958
It looks like an academy or something...

914
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:11,000
And there's two baby grands
back to back.

915
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:12,042
What kind of baby grands?

916
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:14,708
Pleyel, both.

917
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:18,708
I've got an idea.

918
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:22,250
Excellent job you made of tuning the
pianos in the concert hall, young man.

919
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,333
Why, thank you ma'am. Thank you.

920
01:13:25,917 --> 01:13:29,292
Last fellow we had in was so drunk
he never found the hall.

921
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:32,417
Ended up tuning the plumbing.

922
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,333
Terrible mess.

923
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,500
Danny?

924
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:49,125
Thirty two years of faces
and I've never forgotten one.

925
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,917
Especially this one.

926
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:53,417
Why especially this one?

927
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,208
Brilliant girl. Absolutely brilliant.

928
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:58,333
Destined for great things
we were sure of it.

929
01:13:58,792 --> 01:14:03,792
And then one day she just disappeared.

930
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:07,417
We thought she'd gone home.
We thought maybe it was financial.

931
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,583
We knew she had
some money problems.

932
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:15,250
But then her family from
China wrote to ask

933
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:19,833
why she hadn't got in touch with them.
Had a little boy and everything.

934
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:22,792
Very strange... Sad...

935
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,083
Ah ha! Here she is.

936
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,375
You OK?

937
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:09,833
I'm OK.

938
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:12,125
You're sure?

939
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:14,375
Sure.

940
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:28,917
Hello!

941
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,667
Guys?

942
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,958
Sam?

943
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,958
Danny?

944
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:57,625
You were supposed to pick me up.

945
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,167
I'm sorry.

946
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,708
You got another picture?

947
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:11,042
The lady said she was
an excellent piano player.

948
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:12,583
I'm sure.

949
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:19,458
You want to hear what she played?

950
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:20,750
How?

951
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:27,750
See? Mozart sonata number eleven.

952
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:36,667
Your mom didn't just play music.
She played beautiful music.

953
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:40,458
Magical music. Great music.

954
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,833
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,

955
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:39,500
but I really do need to know
where to find him.

956
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:43,333
No, I never seen him before in my life.

957
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,208
Let me rephrase the question.

958
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,625
What is this?

959
01:18:57,875 --> 01:19:00,833
Oh Sam, oh Sam, he remembered.

960
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,042
I was playing the piano,
the music and he remembered...

961
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:05,000
Slow down. Slow down.
Remembered what?

962
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,042
His mother. Who killed his mother.

963
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:08,292
You remember who killed your mother?

964
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:09,250
Sam, we have to go!

965
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:11,458
Wait, son, wait now.
Before we go running off anywhere,

966
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:13,750
let's stop and take a deep breath
and decide what's going on.

967
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:17,583
Tell me from the top. Danny?

968
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:33,667
Danny, wait... Listen to me.

969
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:34,583
Danny, wait!

970
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:35,250
Will you just listen?

971
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,208
No time.

972
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,042
Danny, Danny, wait!

973
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,375
Boss, these boys aren't up to it.
He's fucked off.

974
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,625
Get in there. Oi!

975
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:10,625
I want him alive!
He's not worth shit to me dead!

976
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:11,500
Go on!

977
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:49,750
Shit!

978
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:51,500
You'd better get in there.

979
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,250
You! You! That way!

980
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:53,125
That's it.

981
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:57,000
That son of a bitch!

982
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,875
It's all going on the bill, Danny boy!

983
01:25:03,042 --> 01:25:04,083
You hear me?

984
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:07,708
It's going on the bill.
And you're gonna pay.

985
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,375
You'll pay me back.

986
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:13,500
Believe me, you're gonna pay! Bastard!

987
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:31,667
You know, it was your fault really.

988
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:37,542
You were such a scrapper.
I could see the potential.

989
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:42,125
With the right training,
my own little guided missile.

990
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:45,792
Listen Danny, I know
we've had some rough patches

991
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,167
but what family doesn't, eh?

992
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:52,792
Listen, you get over this business.

993
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,750
We can have plenty more.

994
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:05,208
Shit!

995
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,417
Find him!

996
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:10,500
C'mon! Hello-o!

997
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:14,875
How did he get in there?

998
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,250
He's in there!

999
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:19,208
Shut up. Let me listen.

1000
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:31,125
Stop breathing down my fucking ear!

1001
01:26:31,292 --> 01:26:31,792
Sorry, boss.

1002
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,750
Move back.

1003
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,625
Clever little bastard.

1004
01:26:56,667 --> 01:26:57,667
Wait here.

1005
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,542
All of you, just wait here.

1006
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:02,708
Danny!

1007
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,542
Danny!

1008
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:07,708
Danny!

1009
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:09,125
Where are you?

1010
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:20,833
Bastards!

1011
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,167
Pajamas?

1012
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:29,167
Fucking pajamas!

1013
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,833
You ungrateful little bastard!

1014
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,042
Where are you?

1015
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:46,583
This is it?

1016
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:49,500
This is your refuge?

1017
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:51,792
Your home away from home?

1018
01:27:52,292 --> 01:27:57,625
This is your place of... awakening?

1019
01:27:58,333 --> 01:27:59,625
Art,

1020
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:01,167
books,

1021
01:28:03,167 --> 01:28:04,750
music?

1022
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,167
For what?

1023
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,750
Did it make you a better person?

1024
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,042
Look what you made of it.

1025
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,458
Nice people took you in.

1026
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:18,792
They give you everything.

1027
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:21,958
And look how you repay them.

1028
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:24,667
You destroyed their lives.

1029
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,583
Like you'll destroy any life.

1030
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:31,625
That's because you're not meant
for this kind of life, Danny.

1031
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:33,208
You're a dog.

1032
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:35,125
You're my dog.

1033
01:28:35,417 --> 01:28:39,167
I fed you. I trained you. I own you.

1034
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:42,667
And I should kill you. Like any
responsible owner would do to a dog

1035
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:49,458
that caused this much pain,
this much suffering.

1036
01:28:57,667 --> 01:28:59,000
But...

1037
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:06,750
The heart...

1038
01:29:13,542 --> 01:29:15,417
Come home, Danny.

1039
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,792
All's forgiven.

1040
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:21,125
You'll be safe.

1041
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:25,583
You'll be back in a world
that you understand.

1042
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:29,375
The only world you'll ever understand.

1043
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:32,875
What do you say?

1044
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,750
Forgive and forget?

1045
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:44,542
I know just how confusing
the world can get.

1046
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:48,958
We'll make it simple again.

1047
01:29:49,792 --> 01:29:51,792
You, me...

1048
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Our cozy little life.

1049
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:57,000
Come on, Danny,

1050
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,417
come on.

1051
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:02,875
Come on. Yes, this is my boy.

1052
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:10,292
Yes, come on, come on...

1053
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:12,292
Welcome home Danny...

1054
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:16,208
I am home.

1055
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:35,917
No, Danny!

1056
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:37,208
Don't! He's gonna kill him!

1057
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:39,167
Don't, Danny!

1058
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:41,417
Don't do this Danny! Don't.

1059
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:42,458
He killed my mother.

1060
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:45,167
This won't bring her back!
And you'll be just like him!

1061
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:47,667
He is me. We're both animals.

1062
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:49,250
Fucking dog!

1063
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:50,875
No, you're not an animal! If you kill him,

1064
01:30:51,042 --> 01:30:53,667
Danny, everything you've done
to make yourself happy will be lost.

1065
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:55,292
Don't listen to this crap!

1066
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,417
They'll lock you in a cage forever!

1067
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:58,083
We are animals!

1068
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,875
No Danny. No.

1069
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:03,875
You know why he wants you to kill him?
It's the only way he can justify what...

1070
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,417
Danny, listen to me.

1071
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,083
Remember your mother.

1072
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:12,625
Remember what I did to her.
I screwed her every day.

1073
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:17,208
I mounted her like the bitch she was!

1074
01:31:24,167 --> 01:31:26,250
You'll never be anything but a dog.

1075
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:29,083
You'll never escape what you are.

1076
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:31,542
You'll never escape what I made you.

1077
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:34,792
A killer.

1078
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:36,542
That's what you are.

1079
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:38,458
That's what you'll always be.

1080
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:40,583
Now, be a good dog.

1081
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:45,417
Kill me, get it over with!
Come on! Kill me!

1082
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:50,167
Shut the hell up!

1083
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,875
That man could talk some serious shit.

1084
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,167
You're alright with that thing
around your neck?

1085
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:26,208
Is it OK?

1086
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:31,750
I'd say it was a decided improvement.

1087
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,625
Ladies and gentlemen the recipient
of the 2 hundred and,

1088
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:39,375
college excellent in piano,
Miss Victoria Mills!

1089
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:52,792
My selection tonight is dedicated
to someone wonderful.

1090
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,875
That's you.

1091
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:56,000
Oh no, no, it's not me
she's talking about.

1092
01:32:56,250 --> 01:33:00,542
Someone whose life was, quite literally,
saved by music.

1093
01:33:01,667 --> 01:33:02,833
That's you my boy.
