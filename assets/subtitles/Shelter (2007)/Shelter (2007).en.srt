1
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,590
Cody?

2
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:36,091
Hey, Zach.

3
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,592
What's up, Cody?

4
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,500
Papi's sleeping.

5
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,990
I can tell.

6
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,710
- Don't play with these, ok?
- Ok.

7
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,180
These are for grandpa.

8
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,350
Ok!

9
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,360
Dad, wake up.

10
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,630
Wake up.

11
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,510
Take these.

12
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,640
Did you do your stretches today, dad?

13
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,260
- Hey, Cody.
- Hey, Mom.

14
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,300
How you doing, kiddo?

15
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
Did you get the cigarettes?

16
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,090
Yeah.

17
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,650
Hey, Zach.

18
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,850
What's up, sis?

19
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,270
Change of plans.
Can you take Cody?

20
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,415
I've got a shift and then I was gonna go see Gabe
before he leaves town.

21
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,030
But I gotta take dad home and Allen called and I'm
supposed to meet up with him later.

22
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,840
I could leave him with dad...

23
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Cody. let's go for a ride.

24
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,070
Thank you.

25
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,000
- Can I drive?
- Come on dad, I'll give you a ride back to yours.

26
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,710
Sure, go get her started.

27
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,560
Cody!

28
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,410
Table 5!

29
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,190
I told you. I can't close up today.

30
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,070
Derell's not here yet.

31
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,020
You're stuck, kid.

32
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,550
This is a diner, Picasso.
Not the Louvre.

33
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,930
Come on! People are waiting.

34
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,920
Finally, man!
I've gotta go.

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,450
Cody, let's jet.

36
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,420
Yo, Gabe!

37
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,720
Hey hey, the Gabester!

38
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,610
You're learning to skate I see.

39
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,500
I've got Cody in the car so let's go.

40
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,990
Baby on board, huh?

41
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,050
- I'm taking you to the lot, right?
- Yeah, cool.

42
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,990
Hey you should come up to S.B.

43
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,900
Wouldn't hurt to get some
pussy you didn't get in high school.

44
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,990
You and Tori broke it off, right?

45
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,740
Sorta...

46
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,180
"Sort of"...

47
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,790
Dude... he's five.

48
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,100
He's sleeping.

49
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,380
No I'm not!

50
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,300
You are a sly one.

51
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,260
Yeah he likes to pretend
he's sleeping.

52
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,680
Go figure.

53
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,780
That smells like Allen's cigarette.

54
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,550
How's Allen?

55
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,100
Jeanne's boyfriend.

56
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,350
Of the week...

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,450
Why don't you try and go to 
Santa Barbara Community College?

58
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,790
You can crash at our house until
you get your own place.

59
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,150
At least get the fuck out of San Pedro.

60
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,900
I don't think the whole student thing
is gonna happen right now.

61
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,330
Why? Because you didn't get into that
Art Institute place?

62
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,650
- Go somewhere else
- "Art Institute place"...

63
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,450
Whatever, it's alright.

64
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,170
That scholarship was my ticket...

65
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,890
Well you are the king of scholarships.

66
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,170
Got me into your ritchie rich private school.

67
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,220
On the shore bus every day.

68
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,380
Rich fuck.

69
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,140
Fuck you, ghetto trash.

70
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,640
You ever declare a major?

71
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,990
Larry said I should go for Communications.

72
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,870
"Communications"
What does that mean?

73
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,510
It means I'm set, dude.
Larry's gonna set me up with something at his firm.

74
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,930
So I can go back and get some more.
partying out of my system.

75
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,000
Move back here, buy a couple suits.
Start making some real cash.

76
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,450
You could have the same life if you wanted.

77
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,850
- Alright man.
- Alright dude. Come up and hang out soon ok?

78
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,890
Alright.

79
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,200
No, I mean it this time.
You've been up once. That shit aint right.

80
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,860
Look, I'll get you a plane ticket
Or just get in the car and drive.

81
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,770
- Cool?
- Ok.

82
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,550
Code-man. Keep it real, play boy.

83
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,020
- Promise?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,970
Ok, ok, go...

85
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,140
Gotta pee, gotta pee...

86
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

87
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,190
I'm gonna go out for a session.

88
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,560
No, I thought you were staying.
I went shopping.

89
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,890
And I invited Ellen over.

90
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,840
What?

91
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,950
I heard you're an eligible bachelor.
Not that you would ever tell me.

92
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,240
If you keep breaking up with Tori like that
one of these times she's not coming back.

93
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,250
Jeanne, Jeanne, come in Jeanne.
Cody to Jeanne.

94
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,090
Cody, I don't wanna play right now.
Just watch the TV.

95
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,920
Listen, I'm heading out. It's breaking hard.

96
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,050
- Zach...
- Later, Codes.

97
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,240
When did you draw this one?

98
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,900
A long time ago.

99
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,440
My mom used to work here
just like yours.

100
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,290
So sometimes I would just
wait out here...

101
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,840
and draw.

102
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,340
Here, I'll show you how.

103
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,290
Go around there...

104
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,080
Here, now you just fill it in.

105
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,180
Want the silver?

106
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,960
Who would wait with you?

107
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,500
When?

108
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,970
When you drew these.

109
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,590
Nobody.

110
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,410
What about Papi?

111
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,910
Well he was very hurt from when he fell
and broke his back at work.

112
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,670
He's your daddy.

113
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,050
Yes.

114
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,620
And you're my daddy.

115
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,270
No, Cody. I'm your uncle.

116
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,030
Your mommy is my sister.
That makes me your uncle.

117
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,990
Roy's your daddy.

118
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,630
Nope. You're my daddy.

119
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,500
You're my daddy.
You're my daddy...

120
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,860
Hey... keep drawing.

121
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,860
Hey, Zach!

122
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,490
What's up.

123
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,120
- Oh hey, Zach.
- You're staying in tonight, right?

124
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,890
Allen's playing at the Landmine and he put 
us on the guest list.

125
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Looks like you're the babysitter
tonight little brother.

126
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,920
Guess so.

127
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,060
<i>Hello?</i>

128
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,080
Hey, monkey.

129
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,700
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

130
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,150
Guess...

131
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,720
<i>Babysitting?</i>

132
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,400
Bingo!

133
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,400
<i>- Hey listen, can I give you a call back?
- Where are you?</i>

134
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,160
<i>Are you there? Zach?
I can't hear anything.</i>

135
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,140
- Uh, yeah
<i>- Hey, I'm losing you.</i>

136
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,560
- Yeah, I'm here.
<i>- Can you hear me? Hello?</i>

137
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,270
Tori, I was...
Just thinking about you and...

138
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,990
Hello?

139
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,670
Jesus Christ! You fucking idiot...

140
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,310
Oh my God... get the opener.

141
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,300
Jeanne, what the fuck?!

142
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,320
Shit, dad's mad.

143
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,300
- I just put him to bed.
- Oh come on, he can sleep through anything.

144
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,910
Just keep it down, alright?

145
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,550
- Did you get the cigarettes?
- Yeah, come here.

146
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,440
I thought your ghetto ass would be done
breaking and entering by now.

147
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,070
Change of code, bitch!

148
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,020
What are you gonna do,
attack the garage next?

149
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,460
That might not go over.

150
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,140
With the Pacific Bluff homeowners agreement,
wouldn't wanna set your dad in trouble with the board.

151
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,260
Step-dad.

152
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,580
I left my longboard here.

153
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,280
That's cool.
How you doing, man?

154
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,290
Good, you know.

155
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,090
So I haven't seen you since your graduation.
What have you been up to?

156
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,600
Nothing. Working, you know.
How about you?

157
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm in town for a few weeks.
House is empty, I could enjoy it.

158
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,710
Clear my head a little bit.

159
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,210
I thought you hated it down here?

160
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,220
I miss the ocean.

161
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,360
Dude, you live in L.A.

162
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,590
I don't paddle out there.

163
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,540
You wanna go?

164
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
- Surfing?
- Uh... yeah.

165
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,770
I suppose there's still a few things
I could teach you.

166
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,060
You will soon learn, butterfly.

167
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,600
Perhaps master underestimates student.

168
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,830
Bring it on, city boy!

169
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,480
- Looks like we picked a good time to come out.
- Yeah, the tide's coming in.

170
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,990
Hey, where are you living now?

171
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,880
With Jeanne in San Pedro.

172
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,090
It's just for now.

173
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,090
I'm trying to save up to get my own place.

174
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,590
Well close to my dad and work and stuff.

175
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,910
Well you guys are welcome to come out 
here anytime you want.

176
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,150
Just like old times, huh?

177
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,640
Minus Gabe.

178
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,070
Right.

179
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,590
Hey... you see him much?

180
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,900
A bit. He came down last year 
with some of his friends.

181
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,970
Those guys like to party.

182
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,270
You can say that again.

183
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,710
How is Jeanne doing?

184
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,520
You know, the same I guess?

185
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,130
I try to help out as much as I can.

186
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,560
I cannot see her as a mom.

187
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,970
Cody must be getting big?

188
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,660
Yeah, he's five already.

189
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,100
It's crazy. Time just flies.

190
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,940
Trust me, it only gets faster.

191
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,230
Yeah, I bet.

192
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,610
Hey, monkey!

193
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,250
Hey, monkey!

194
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,490
What's up? 
What are you doing down here?

195
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,830
Some beers, the dogs,
and a fire on the beach.

196
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,650
Come down, grab a beer.

197
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,970
- Cool, I'll be down in a sec.
- Alright.

198
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,380
Do you wanna go grab a beer or do
you wanna just take off?

199
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,770
Yeah, I'll grab a beer.
Sounds good.

200
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,160
So who'd you come down with?

201
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,960
Billy.

202
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,530
Who is that?

203
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,360
Shaun!

204
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,310
- Gabe's brother?
- Yeah.

205
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,990
He doesn't come back much.
He's been pretty MIA.

206
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,480
Nice to see you.

207
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,750
It's good to see you too.
Going long!

208
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,290
Are you gonna play or are you just
gonna talk shit about me?

209
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,710
Nice throw.

210
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,210
I'm Tori.

211
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,500
I remember you.
You were 13 and you had crimped hair.

212
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,730
But I remember you.

213
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,180
I bought you guys wine coolers.

214
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,090
- I think you puked on my parents' deck.
- Wow.

215
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,520
- You still putting up with this guy's shit?
- Well we're both still here.

216
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,180
Right on.

217
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,370
That's why you never tell a woman
how to cook a chicken.

218
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,550
<i>I can't believe you got shot by a chick.</i>

219
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,210
Shaun, right?
Aren't you Gabe's bro?

220
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,050
Yeah.

221
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,210
Heard you went all Hollywood
writing movies or something.

222
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,140
Yeah, or something.

223
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,630
What's the deal?
You're still with Tori then?

224
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,970
Are you a fag?
I mean she's hot.

225
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,830
So it's cool if I move in on that then?

226
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,990
The swell's coming in.

227
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,730
Yeah it looks that way.

228
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,890
- Trip seeing Tori.
- Yeah, I bet.

229
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,240
You guys have been together for years.

230
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,870
Yeah we're just taking a little break
right now.

231
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,990
She's my best friend.

232
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,240
Other than Gabe.

233
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,850
It's all good.

234
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,750
You dating anyone?

235
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,480
No, I just broke up.

236
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,300
Yeah?
Is that why you're really down here?

237
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,810
No...

238
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,300
Yeah, actally it is.

239
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,340
I moved out of our place and my new lease
doesn't start until the end of the month.

240
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,130
That's cool.

241
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,110
I'm sorry.

242
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,830
Hello?

243
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,510
I thought we weren't gonna leave him over there.

244
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,070
No, don't drive, Jeanne.

245
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,140
I'll go get him.

246
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,590
Yeah.

247
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,820
I gotta go.

248
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,890
Alright.

249
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,720
Tori said she needs a ride so...

250
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,140
That's cool, I'll catch a ride
from someone.

251
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,500
Great riding today.

252
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,600
- Alright.
- It was good seeing you man.

253
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,680
- Yeah it was fun.
- Ok cool.

254
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,900
I'm gonna leave.

255
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,820
Wait, come here...

256
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm tired.
Goodnight.

257
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,440
Did I write this shit?

258
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,090
Oh my God.

259
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,320
Hello! Hello! Is anybody out there?

260
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,200
Hello... Shaun?

261
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,470
- Who the fuck is this?
- Master does not know his own student.

262
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,980
Student is ashamed.
Master gets old.

263
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,960
Where'd you find these?

264
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,150
Dude, they were just laying
around the house.

265
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,240
Gabe and I used to stay up for
hours on these.

266
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,180
I can't believe that these
go all the way to your house.

267
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,810
All the way to the ghetto.

268
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,780
They were the latest technology
back then.

269
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,900
I think your dad bought them
in an airport.

270
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,410
when he missed a Christmas one year.

271
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,050
Step-dad.

272
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,830
Yeah, I remember that year.
I think he got me a talking dart board.

273
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,650
That sucks!

274
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,660
Oh hey, I saw some of your tags today.
They're sweet.

275
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,780
- Yeah?
- You've got the crane going on, looks cool.

276
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,740
Glad to see someone's doing
their artwork.

277
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,050
Yeah, sometimes.

278
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,210
It was nice riding out there today.

279
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,260
Yeah.

280
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,260
What's up?.

281
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,730
Your batteries are probably gonna run out.

282
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,950
Probably haven't been replaced
in 10 years.

283
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,420
What are you listening to?

284
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,010
Nothing...

285
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,830
He's a fighter.

286
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,350
He's gonna kick his ass.

287
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,900
But he wants to look good...

288
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,320
kicking his ass.

289
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,320
He's wearing a sweet suit
And he's gonna kick his ass.

290
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,090
Dude, it's breaking overhead
Let's roll to the 'bu.

291
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,360
I'm working.

292
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,790
Really? That's too bad.

293
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,990
Alright, I'll see you later then.

294
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,980
Alright! Hold on, I'll come.

295
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,620
You might wanna change first.

296
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,990
Come on dude, let's go!

297
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,510
Dude, it's a fucking circus out there.

298
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,740
I'll protect you from the big brewery.
Pussy!

299
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,290
Go... I've got a better spot.

300
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,920
Better spot...

301
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,250
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

302
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,460
- The waves are great.
- Just gotta figure out where this road is.

303
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,970
Oh right there!

304
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,730
Careful.

305
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,880
- Should've told me sooner.
- Sorry.

306
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,520
This is rad!

307
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,410
Sorry I never told you and Gabe
about this place, man.

308
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,830
I just didn't want it to turn into the
remnants of your keggers every Sunday morning.

309
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,470
This is my place I used to get away to
come and just think.

310
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,220
- And surf?
- And surf.

311
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,600
Let's go.

312
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,330
So you still thinking about
applying to art school?

313
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,680
I do street art now.

314
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,290
It's cool though, you know.

315
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,990
What are you working on?

316
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,290
A book.

317
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,900
It's been like 3 years since 
the last one, right?

318
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,860
- Is is really long or something?
- Fuck off.

319
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,680
You sure didn't leave much out
of the last one.

320
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,300
You read it?

321
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,530
Who knew there'd be so much drama
inside the gates of Pacific Bluffs.

322
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,150
<i>I</i> never knew.

323
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,540
You never really know
what's happening inside.

324
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,250
That's what I liked about it.

325
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,290
- I did embellish a little bit, it <i>is</i> fiction.
- You changed a couple of names?

326
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,580
When did you read it?

327
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,800
When it came out.

328
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,990
Funny, Gabe never mentioned anything.

329
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,010
I never told him.

330
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,640
Why would he tell you?

331
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,190
I just never knew that
you knew about me.

332
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,110
What's your new one about?

333
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,010
Still trying to figure that out.

334
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
Don't really have a subject yet.

335
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,780
But, I'll get it back.

336
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,110
I hope so.

337
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,410
You're good.

338
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,570
- You really liked it?
- Yeah.

339
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,790
You hungry?

340
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,450
- Yeah, you wanna go to the shack or something?
- Yeah, definitely.

341
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,190
So, how long you staying around?

342
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm gonna be here for a while.

343
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,930
I was supposed to go to Barcelona to meet
a friend next month but I'm kinda broke.

344
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,690
You should ask your stepfather for the cash.

345
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,760
That's not my style.

346
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,170
Have you ever been to Europe.

347
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,650
I've been to Florida once.

348
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,470
And that time your parents took
me to Mexico.

349
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,940
- That's about it.
- That's right.

350
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,320
- I don't travel much.
- You should go, man.

351
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,340
I'd like to someday.

352
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,200
I mean, just for the art.

353
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,450
Go ahead, take it.

354
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,100
Nah, it's cool.

355
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,500
- What? You guys like, in limbo or something?
- Yeah...

356
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,680
- I'm no good at that.
- Takes a little practice.

357
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,910
And he drives right through the stop sign.

358
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,920
And out into some field.
He totally passed out.

359
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,030
He must've been wasted, man.

360
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,080
He was totally hammered.
He's a fucking idiot.

361
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,440
But he's my brother.
And I love him.

362
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,400
And my best friend.

363
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,660
Cheers!

364
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,200
I'm gonna get another... you?

365
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,910
Ok.

366
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,570
Here you go...

367
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,040
Thanks, brother.

368
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,940
- Wow.
- Woah... what are you doing?

369
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,420
Easy dude, it's ok.
I wanna look at it.

370
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,290
No one ever looks at that.

371
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,750
Wow, is that Cody?

372
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,740
Yeah.

373
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,740
A sad Cody.

374
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,150
You could tell?

375
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,300
Yeah. And how you darkened it 
around his head.

376
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,090
This is incredible.

377
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,910
And there's no toys in his room.

378
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,670
That's awesome.

379
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,800
Yeah, he'd just gotten scolded.
He was trying to understand why...

380
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,500
So he came into my room.

381
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,100
He hasn't left yet.
It's the only place he could sleep.

382
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,540
Ok, enough.

383
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,450
Adam's apple.

384
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,510
- I'm trashed.
- The cops are definitely coming.

385
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,640
Shit!

386
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,390
What?
You can make it.

387
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,720
Cody, let's go.

388
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,800
Where were you?

389
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,350
- Surfing.
- All night?

390
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,860
Yeah, what the fuck?

391
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,590
I'm just asking.

392
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,800
- Want a ride or not?
- Go.

393
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,070
Cody, let's go!

394
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,930
I think I should reapply
to CalArts...

395
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,040
What's CalArts?

396
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,430
It's a school, buddy.

397
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,100
- I get to go to school next year.
- Yep.

398
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,200
They already turned you down.

399
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,650
What made you think of that?

400
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,030
It's just a thought.

401
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,300
Well don't get your hopes up.

402
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,950
I mean we're having a hard time, Zach.
I don't need you getting all down.

403
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,900
Yeah...

404
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,240
Allen paints houses. Maybe I can see if
he can hook you up with a job.

405
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,710
You're heavy.

406
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,720
- I'll be right in.
- Alright, hurry up.

407
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,060
Hey, monkey.

408
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,500
Hey.

409
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,450
I'm late.

410
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,560
Hey.

411
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,060
Oh hey.

412
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,992
I hear you've been hanging out with Shaun.

413
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,800
Surfing.

414
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,350
Well you know about him, right?

415
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,700
What about him?

416
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,950
He's gay.

417
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,890
He's an old friend, Jeanne.
We've been surfing together since I was 8.

418
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,150
Yeah, well is that all?

419
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,520
Yeah, what are you saying?

420
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,230
- Nothing.
- Good.

421
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,690
Zach, I just don't think he's the best guy
to be hanging out with all day half-naked...

422
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,540
if you know what I mean.
And I don't want Cody around that.

423
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,230
What? Why?

424
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,370
I'm late. Get out.

425
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,600
Fine.

426
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,390
Zach, you're not a fag, right?

427
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,410
Jeanne...

428
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,510
You never tell me anything.
How am I supposed to know?

429
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,880
What do you think?

430
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,480
I think I don't wanna deal with that.

431
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,790
Hi dude.

432
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,080
- I tried calling you.
- Yeah.

433
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,770
- Listen, I just wanted to...
- I'm really busy man.

434
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,750
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Yeah, I know.

435
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,090
- Listen, man...
- Just drop it, dude.

436
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,060
Ok.

437
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,090
Hey, Shaun.

438
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,100
Hey. What's up?

439
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,350
I need help!

440
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,850
Shaun, this is Cody.

441
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,180
Hi Cody, how are you man?
I'm shaun.

442
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,250
I need help.

443
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,570
You need help?

444
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,580
Alright...

445
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,750
But dude you've got it all wrong.

446
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,630
You've gotta fortify the corners of
the moat first

447
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,460
Fortify?

448
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,100
Codes, let's go.

449
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,210
I'm not done, I have to fortify!

450
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,680
Shaun, do you mind looking after
Cody for a second?

451
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,760
We're cool.

452
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,360
Let's go for a walk.

453
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,890
No, I don't think I should leave Cody.

454
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,190
Come on, Shaun can watch him.

455
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,340
You guys go, it's fine.

456
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,230
Alright.

457
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,810
There we go.

458
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,650
This is gonna be a sweet walking bridge.
Oh look at that.

459
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,720
Shaun's great with Cody.

460
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,790
Listen, I'm sorry about the other day.

461
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,770
It was stupid.

462
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,430
Just make up your mind, Zach.

463
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,770
If you don't want to be together just
don't pull that shit on me

464
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,320
Ok.

465
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,080
If it's what you want then
I'm gonna move on.

466
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,090
Alright.

467
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,990
You know what that means, right?

468
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,900
Yeah, Tori. I know what that means.

469
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,350
Just go, ok?

470
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,850
Come on, Cody.
Time to go.

471
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,270
Five more minutes.

472
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,510
Shaun rocks.

473
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,920
No, Cody. Let's go.

474
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,540
Shaun rocks!

475
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,150
Can I jump on the sand castle?

476
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,410
No, we gotta go. Come on.

477
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,610
The tide's gonna get it anyway.
You might as well let him have at it.

478
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,840
Go ahead.

479
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,210
Alright man, great job!

480
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,060
Come on, little man.

481
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,030
Sayonara.

482
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,270
Hey, I just wanted to talk
to you about the other night.

483
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,700
What?

484
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,600
I think you're really talented.

485
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,470
And I don't think you should throw it away.
I think you should do something with it.

486
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,040
Is that it?

487
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,300
Yeah.

488
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,570
I'm late.

489
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,850
Tor, I'll call...

490
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,560
Good morning.

491
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,690
What time is it?

492
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,520
Why?
You got somewhere to go?

493
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah. Yeah I gotta go.

494
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,500
Wait.

495
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,740
Listen, I gotta go.

496
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,270
- Hey, Jeanne.
- Hey.

497
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,950
Where's Cody?

498
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,650
Like you care.

499
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,110
What are you talking about?

500
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,720
Where were you last night?
I called you like 3 times.

501
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,280
Did you need something?

502
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,900
Yeah. I need to know you're there.

503
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,110
I'm always there.
For Cody.

504
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:29,640
You weren't last night.

505
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,370
What do you need, Jeanne?

506
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,990
Actually, Allen is going up 
to Portland this weekend.

507
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,310
He's gonna make a bid for a job.
He said he'd take me.

508
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,100
It would do me so much good
to get out of here.

509
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,140
- Allen?
- Yeah.

510
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,990
- Allen?
- Uh huh.

511
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,990
Can you watch Cody this weekend?
Please...

512
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,590
I was hoping to have the weekend to myself.

513
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,220
Why?

514
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,550
Who are you fucking?

515
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,410
What?
What are you talking about?

516
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,280
Come on, I saw you gazing out the window.

517
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,280
I know it's not Tori.
Who is it?

518
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,810
Nobody?

519
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,510
Well I guess you're free then.

520
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,250
Come on, Zach. You're all I've got.

521
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,780
I know.

522
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,740
Hey.

523
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:34,241
<i>Hey. Everything cool?</i>

524
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,870
Yeah...

525
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,890
<i>What are you doing?</i>

526
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:41,990
Going to work.

527
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,950
<i>Come on over tonight.
I'll cook steaks.</i>

528
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,550
Uh... I can't.

529
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,000
<i>Come on. I'll make margaritas.</i>

530
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,540
<i>Strong ones.</i>

531
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,710
<i>Who is that?</i>

532
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,030
No one.

533
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,880
Hold on.

534
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,590
So you can do it, right?

535
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,780
I gotta tell Allen.

536
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,730
Fine.

537
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,230
Cool, thanks.

538
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,400
Shaun, I can't.

539
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,200
<i>Why?</i>

540
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,330
Jeanne's leaving for the weekend
and I gotta watch Cody.

541
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,360
<i>So bring him.</i>

542
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,380
No.

543
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,540
<i>Why not?</i>

544
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,650
You don't care?

545
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,630
<i>No! That kid's great.</i>

546
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,190
<i>He says some funny shit.</i>

547
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,410
<i>Look, I'm turning the grill on at 8.</i>

548
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,120
Ok.

549
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,360
Come on, dude.

550
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,340
I like these!
I like these!

551
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,190
Nah, you don't want those.

552
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,080
I think you should get these.

553
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,470
But I want real shoes.

554
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,100
But these are way cooler.

555
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,250
Ok.

556
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,990
Alright, let's go.

557
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,460
Hey! Ankle biter!
What's up man, how are ya?

558
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,990
Are you hungry?

559
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,640
Starving!

560
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,660
Starving?
What would you like for dinner?

561
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,120
He'll eat whatever.

562
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,820
I don't think I was asking him, was I?

563
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,880
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

564
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,310
Cold ones are in the fridge.

565
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,930
- What are you drinking?
- Red. Larry had this sick bottle in the cellar.

566
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,390
I'll try that.

567
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,500
Alright, cool.

568
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,700
Alright, buddy. Lay it on me.
What you gonna have for dinner tonight?

569
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,880
Mac and Cheese

570
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,050
Ok.

571
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,920
Hot dogs.

572
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,210
Hot dogs?

573
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:56,280
Pancakes with...

574
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,090
Chocolate chips.

575
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,350
Chocolate chips? Ok!

576
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,620
and no vegetables.

577
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,440
No vegetables?
Are you sure?

578
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,510
Sure, sure?

579
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,970
Ok. Alright, buddy.

580
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:08,780
I want you to do me a favor...

581
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,990
Go look out at the ocean.

582
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,650
Beautiful waves coming in right now.

583
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,250
I'm gonna make your dinner.
Somehow.

584
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,930
- Are we still in California?
- Yeah, buddy.

585
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:20,790
Where are you going?

586
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,480
I don't think we have that stuff in the house.

587
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,320
Seriously, dude. Don't worry about it.

588
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,560
No, I want to.

589
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,380
Little kids are supposed to be spoiled.

590
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,780
Besides, I'll be back in five minutes, ok?

591
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,520
I'm gonna go check on him.

592
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,180
Where did Jeanne say she was going?

593
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,330
She's going to Oregon.

594
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,800
She thinks there's some job
up there worth checking out.

595
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,870
I admire what you're doing for Cody.

596
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,990
You don't have to.

597
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,800
Yeah. I do.

598
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,400
It's a choice, Zach.

599
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,750
It's family.

600
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,580
I'm the only one left.

601
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,910
You get that from your mom.

602
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,760
Yeah, I know.
Lucky me.

603
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:24,990
Come here.

604
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,750
What?

605
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,250
Come here.

606
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,750
I need to go check...

607
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:33,320
He's fine. He's asleep.

608
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,700
He's ok. Just come here.

609
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,400
You sure you guys don't wanna stay?

610
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,810
He doesn't like waking up in strange places.

611
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,790
Gets enough of that when I'm not around.

612
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,250
Take this.

613
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,820
What is it?

614
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,890
CalArts application.

615
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,360
Shaun, I'm not going down this road again.

616
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,650
Take it.

617
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,220
Thanks for tonight.

618
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,330
Ok.

619
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,550
Bye.

620
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,120
So you gonna head back up to L.A. soon?

621
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,820
I'm pretty happy here.

622
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,970
Hey... why don't you come with me?

623
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,480
Yeah, right.

624
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,160
I'm serious.

625
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,120
You could come with me.
I live right near CalArts.

626
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:32,200
You're so beautiful.

627
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,720
Shut up!

628
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,010
Hey, learn to take a compliment.

629
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,890
Thanks.

630
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,710
So glad you're here.

631
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,490
Me too.

632
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:54,090
<i>Yo, bro. What do you know!</i>

633
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,620
Gabe!

634
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,130
Come on, come on!

635
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,630
Shaunypoo!

636
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,690
<i>Your little brother Gabe's back!</i>

637
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,520
Where's my princess big brother?

638
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,660
<i>What? You got a guy in there 
you slut?</i>

639
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,400
No!

640
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,930
<i>Ooohh, a girl?</i>

641
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,990
Yeah, right!

642
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,130
Did I interrupt your beating off, or what?

643
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,960
No, I was sleeping.

644
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,740
Sleeping?
With the door locked?

645
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,010
Ok, weirdo...

646
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,400
No, hey, come here dude!

647
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,430
- Good to see you too, bro.
- I missed you so much.

648
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,120
There it is, yeah.

649
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,300
Dude, so what are you doing here man?

650
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,150
I thought you were moving into
your new place this week.

651
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,790
No, no. The thought of...

652
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,670
moving into an empty place is
just depressing, you know?

653
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,450
Yeah? Well it's pretty empty here.

654
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,050
You doing alright?

655
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,090
Yeah, I'm good.

656
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,200
- You sure?
- Yeah!

657
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,800
I heard it was pretty tough there for a while.

658
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,860
Yeah, it was tough.

659
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,370
Well don't worry, Romeo.
You'll find a new one.

660
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,560
Yeah, thanks.

661
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:00,010
So, you ready to hang up your pink Gucci suit
and come bail out with your real friends?

662
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,120
Yeah, ok.

663
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,620
Right on, I'll call Zach.

664
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,640
Ok, good.

665
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,680
Who was that?

666
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,470
June's probably cleaning today.

667
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,680
But June comes on Tuesdays.

668
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:14,850
Yes she does.

669
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,660
Pool guy? I dunno.

670
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,850
You ok?

671
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You look a bit freaked out.

672
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,860
No, I'm just tired.

673
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,360
- Alright.
- Just tired.

674
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:29,880
There anything good to eat in the fridge or is it stocked
with low-carb fag food cos I'm fucking starving man.

675
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,140
Just a lot of fag food.

676
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,170
Yo, burger boy.

677
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,260
What up?

678
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,510
What are you doing down here?

679
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,740
Cherie's back in town for the weekend.
Told her I'd come down.

680
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,080
I thought there's plenty of 
pussy in S.B.

681
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,340
Oh yeah. But the girls there
are fucking teases man.

682
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,290
Whatever. Party's on for tonight.

683
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,440
Everyone's coming.

684
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,050
We'll go grab a quick surf sesh...

685
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,260
and get started.

686
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,430
I'm not off for another half hour.

687
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,890
No worries.
I already fixed your spare board.

688
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,850
The one you've been keeping at the house.

689
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,730
I saw it out back and I fixed it.
Grabbed it, patched it all up...

690
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:16,700
Oh yeah... that board.
Man, I left that there a while ago.

691
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
Whatever.
So I'll see you around five tonight?

692
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,150
- Ok.
- Alright, cool.

693
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,800
Nice shirt, by the way.

694
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,610
Dude, so what's the latest?

695
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,920
Are you and Tori really over this time?

696
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,160
Yeah.

697
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,240
Glad to hear it. It's about time.

698
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,760
So what are you doing then?
Just playing the field?

699
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,320
I talked to a bunch of people and
no one sees you anywhere.

700
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,950
Everyone's gone man.

701
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,540
Yo, there he is!

702
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,030
You lasted pretty long out there, old man.

703
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,230
My big bro on a longboard.

704
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,270
Never thought I'd see the day.

705
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,640
Give me 10 years and call me back about that.

706
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:14,060
Yeah, right. I'll never be on a longboard. Ever.

707
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,850
Alright, I'm getting beers.

708
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,980
What's up, babe?

709
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,100
Shaun...

710
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,310
Shaun, just chill.

711
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,200
Hey, Codes.

712
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,700
What's wrong?

713
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,590
Cody, go to your room for a second.

714
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,970
Please tell me that he's just confused.

715
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,680
What do you mean?

716
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,310
Zach, why didn't you tell me?

717
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,720
Tell you what?

718
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,040
Ok, your confusion is one thing...

719
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,030
But bringing Cody into this is just totally fucked.

720
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,310
I didn't bring him to anything!

721
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,860
- You brought him to Shaun!
- He likes Shaun!

722
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,670
Shaun's better than...

723
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,780
You know what, forget it.
It's not about Shaun, it's about us.

724
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,670
It is about our family.

725
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,520
What about it?

726
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,860
Cody lost his father. He needs you.
He needs a positive man in his life.

727
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,890
I'm sorry I'm no Allen.

728
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:43,360
You don't know shit.
He's a little kid.

729
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,120
He's not gonna understand this.

730
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,260
You mother of the fucking year now?

731
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,610
Oh fuck you.

732
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,050
He'd be lost without me!

733
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,380
Fuck you, Zach!

734
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,240
Zach, are you trying to fuck up our family?

735
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:58,200
Yeah, Jeanne. That's what I'm trying to do.

736
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,640
You know? Cody has a sense of family because of me.

737
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,630
Mom died and I got the family fucking gene.

738
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh, I see. So it's the 'family' gene that's making
you run off and have your big gay wedding?

739
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,140
You gonna make the family proud?

740
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,400
Is that what you're scared of?

741
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,000
This isn't about Shaun, or me.

742
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,160
This is about you being left.

743
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,720
I'm the only one who hasn't run off on you.

744
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,510
Sweet.

745
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,920
But go ahead, judge me.

746
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,920
I don't care. You know? You're right.

747
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,960
Yeah, guys have left me.

748
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,260
But, Zach, now you are just a Summer fuck, ok?

749
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,650
You've reduced yourself to a little piece of ass

750
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,120
so, bravo!
You are doing really well for yourself.

751
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,800
Do you think that is a good upbringing for him?

752
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,190
- Yes.
- Do you?

753
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,900
No, I don't know.

754
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,860
Well... if it is do you think you'd have to hide
it from me, from Gabe, from Tori?

755
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,860
I don't know!
I don't fucking know, ok?

756
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,350
I just want what's best for Cody.

757
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,710
Well so do I!

758
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,680
Sorry.

759
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:37,300

760
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,500
Oh God.

761
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,320
Hey.

762
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,550
I need some time.

763
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,680
I just don't know if this 
is really what I want.

764
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,440
Seems like what you want.

765
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,110
I just don't know if this
is what I want.

766
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,690
For good.

767
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,150
What's that supposed to mean?

768
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,400
It's not as easy for me as it is for you.

769
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,380
You know, this is all totally new to me.

770
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,990
We'll get through the Gabe thing...

771
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,300
No it's not that, Shaun.

772
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,710
You just don't get it, ok?

773
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:45,440
I can't just take whatever I want.
My life is not like that.

774
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,000
You'll never get what you want unless you take it.

775
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,330
Take it...

776
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:53,520
You and Gabe have always been able to point and take.
No questions asked.

777
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:57,270
You don't realize it's not like that for other people.
It's fucking ignorant.

778
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,980
Oh and you and Jeanne just blame everyone else
because you can't do anything for yourselves?

779
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,790
What do you call that?

780
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,350
Look... fuck!

781
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,230
Why are you doing this?

782
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,750
Don't go all emotional and faggy on me, ok?

783
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,920
What?

784
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,870
I'm sick of being your childhood
wet dream, Shaun.

785
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,900
Find another fucking fantasy!

786
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,430
You know what? You're a fucking coward!

787
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,810
I'm done.

788
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,080
You're a fucking coward.

789
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,680
I'm done.

790
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,110
Get out!

791
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,930
We're closed!

792
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,690
What's up, bro?

793
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,020
Good, brother.

794
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,070
I'm so hungover...

795
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,930
Kitchen's closed.
Do you want a coffee?

796
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,010
Yes, please.

797
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:19,730
So what's up?

798
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,180
I'm taking off later today.
Never saw you leave last night.

799
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,190
- So...
- So?

800
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,680
Why didn't you tell me?

801
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,280
Tell you what?

802
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:44,210
I don't care... at all.

803
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

804
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,680
Have you always known?

805
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,090
Seriously, dude.

806
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,600
Ok.

807
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,390
The fact that it's my brother is totally weird.

808
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,900
I know.

809
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,950
No, like...

810
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,040
really really fucking weird.

811
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,980
Alright, I got it.
I'm sorry.

812
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,670
Don't be sorry.

813
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,480
Don't tell anyone, ok?

814
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:21,830
Ok.

815
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,800
So are you going with other guys?

816
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:25,840
No!

817
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,730
I heard they give better head.
They give better head, don't they?

818
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,890
Dude, stop!

819
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,360
- Do they swallow?
- Gabe!

820
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,550
Do you think he's hot?

821
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,250
Shut the fuck up, dude!

822
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,630
Fine.

823
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,550
- So, where'd you go last night?
- I slept in my car.

824
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,810
Why didn't you just crash at mine?

825
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,160
This doesn't have to change things.

826
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:58,270
Doesn't change things?
You're right, Gabe.

827
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,770
I used to be the guy you came and
talked to, remember?

828
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,190
Before Shaun.

829
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,460
This isn't exactly easy on me.

830
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,400
This isn't easy on you, right?

831
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,440
You know what? It's over anyway.
So just leave it, dude.

832
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,200
I've gotta clean up and
you've gotta leave.

833
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,420
Hey, we're still bros, alright?

834
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,820
I mean it.

835
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,730
Come here.

836
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,530
Can I please just come in and crash?

837
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,400
Jeanne?

838
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,010
What?

839
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,521
Have you seen my portfolio?
I can't find it anywhere.

840
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,180
I don't know.

841
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,980
The portfolio I was putting together for CalArts.

842
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:21,370
No, I haven't seen it.

843
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,270
- What's today?
- I think the 30th.

844
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,810
Fuck!

845
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,490
Zachy, what are you doing?
They turned you down.

846
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,400
Why do you wanna put yourself
through that again?

847
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,200
I just thought I'd give it another shot, you know?

848
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,940
Well don't bother. That place is full of rich kid painters
and they're all gonna end up working at art stores anyway.

849
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,110
Yeah, maybe.

850
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,600
They're hiring at the Ocenette.
Do you want me to put in a good word?

851
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,540
It's a good job.

852
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:52,470
We could use the money.

853
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:06,590
How come we never see Shaun anymore?

854
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,720
Sometimes that happens, Cody.
People leave sometimes.

855
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,140
Why did he leave?

856
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,610
It's complicated. A grown-up thing.

857
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:26,250
Can we say hi to him even though he left?
He was cool.

858
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,230
No.
Sometimes people leave and never come back.

859
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,590
Like my daddy?

860
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,150
Yes, Cody. Like your daddy.

861
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,720
Hey.

862
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,000
Hey, Jeanne.

863
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,720
Rick is on today and he's a nightmare.
So steer clear.

864
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,300
Got it.

865
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,810
Hey, Cody. Are you ready?

866
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:54,060
Give me your pen.

867
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,640
Bye, kiddo.

868
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:14,020
<i>You have 1 new message.</i>

869
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:17,020
<i>Hey, Zach.
It's Kelly Burke, from CalArts.</i>

870
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,370
<i>I got your portfolio
and your application.</i>

871
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,420
<i>Kinda surprised to see 
that you applied again.</i>

872
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,780
<i>But really happy that you did.</i>

873
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,330
<i>So I returned the portfolio to the Ocean 
Beach address that you sent it from.</i>

874
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,890
<i>There's a couple of things I need to go over
with you before I can continue with it.</i>

875
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,700
<i>So give me a call when you get this.</i>

876
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:36,810
<i>I'm at extension 20 and I hope to hear from you.
Alright, take care.</i>

877
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:43,320
<i>To replay, press 4. To erase, press 7. 
To return this call, press 8. To save, press 9.</i>

878
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,590
<i>To hear all other options, press star.</i>

879
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,930
Jeanne, get up!
Get up!

880
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,590
What are you doing?

881
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,790
Sleeping.

882
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,590
Yeah, with some help.

883
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,290
Wait, Zach, wait.

884
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,590
Allen got that job.

885
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,620
Yeah?

886
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,760
In Portland and I gotta go with him.

887
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,830
I can make good money there.

888
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,520
But they don't take kids.

889
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,680
What do you mean they don't take kids?

890
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:43,980
I don't know. They just don't take kids.

891
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:51,000
Allen's not really into it anyway.

892
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:59,280
Cody's gonna have to stay 
here with you and Papi...

893
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,600
At least until we get set up.

894
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,840
With me and dad for how long?

895
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:07,520
I dunno. Six months... a year maybe?

896
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,570
You know he can't stay with dad.

897
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:17,460
I know.

898
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,040
But he can't come with me.

899
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:30,320
Zach, the Oceanette is not cutting it.
I can make three times that up there.

900
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,820
Is there any more?

901
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,410
Well I'm full, do you want mine?

902
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,450
Yeah.

903
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,860
I do.

904
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,410
You like it?

905
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:54,530
Yeah.

906
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,860
- Mom?
- Yeah.

907
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,900
Can I go to Oregon too?

908
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,540
Cody, I told you.
You gotta stay here

909
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,030
and keep your uncle Zach company 
so he doesn't get lonely.

910
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:13,400
Can you do that for mommy?

911
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,530
Hello?

912
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,690
No, he's not here.

913
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:25,250
Hey, monkey.

914
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:27,780
Hey.

915
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:32,990
I got in.

916
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,430
What?

917
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,400
To CalArts, they took me back.

918
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,540
I don't know how I'll do it.

919
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:43,310
You'll have to figure out a way.

920
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:45,540
If you pass it up
You'll be stuck here.

921
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,950
I don't feel stuck here.

922
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,400
Yes you do.

923
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:54,340
Jeanne wants to go to Oregon.

924
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,460
Maybe she'll have to stay.

925
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,440
Cody is her responsibility.

926
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,730
I can't leave him.

927
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,580
Figure it out.

928
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:06,760
Cheer up!

929
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,890
Can we just celebrate?

930
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,690
There's something I really
need to tell you.

931
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,630
I already know.

932
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,270
I've known for a while.

933
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:31,190
You are the only reason
I wish I wasn't.

934
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:34,820
None of this other shit matters.

935
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,380
But what really sucks...

936
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:43,590
Is that I've always wanted to 
be everything to you.

937
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,100
Always dreamed of providing you with
anything you ever wanted or needed.

938
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,990
Do you love him?

939
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,290
Oh come on...

940
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,500
Seriously.

941
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,460
He's a good guy, Zach.

942
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,310
You don't belong to people forever.

943
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,670
Then why bother?

944
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:12,410
Isn't it worth it?

945
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,660
Yeah.

946
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,680
- Tori.
- Yeah?

947
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,180
Can I stay with you 
just for the night?

948
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,040
I have nowhere else to go and
I can't face Jeanne.

949
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,150
Of course.

950
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,850
But you can't fuck me.

951
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,180
Come on...

952
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,770
Say something.

953
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,620
You say something.

954
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:51,550
Student was bad.
Made bad judgment call.

955
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,470
Now see truth.

956
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,500
Where are you?

957
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,720
Getting warmer...

958
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,550
Colder...

959
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,330
Turn around.

960
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,680
I'm so sorry.

961
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,990
You'd better be.

962
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,350
You sent in my application?

963
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,650
Yeah.

964
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,310
Why are you here?

965
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,560
What changed?

966
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,550
I did.

967
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:52,990
Will you help me?

968
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:56,630
You serious?

969
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,560
Of course.
Anything.

970
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:01,900
Anything?

971
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,030
Yes.

972
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:07,990
I got in.

973
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:10,540
- Full ride.
- Yes! I knew it!

974
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:12,470
Are you serious?

975
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,380
Yeah, I really wanna go this time.

976
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:15,660
Of course.

977
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,620
I turned down the scholarship before.

978
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:26,140
My mom... Cody... everything.
It just couldn't work out.

979
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,200
I never told anyone.

980
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,470
I really wanna go this time.

981
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,390
And you did say you lived close.

982
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,560
Well then let's do it.

983
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,470
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

984
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:53,270
I'm so proud of you, man. So proud.

985
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,650
- Shaun!
- Hey, kiddo...

986
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,970
Allen, take Cody inside, ok?

987
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,960
Zach, what is he doing here?

988
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,400
What? Are you bailing on me?

989
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,520
Bailing?

990
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,310
Jeanne, you're the one leaving your son!

991
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:48,270
If you don't like this option then just stay.

992
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,650
<i>Five more minutes!</i>

993
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:51,630
Jesus, Cody. Shut the fuck up you...

994
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,400
Dont you ever talk to him like that!

995
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,920
- Zach!
- Allen!

996
01:20:57,970 --> 01:20:59,880
Take a walk baby, please? For me. Please...

997
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,290
Ok, ok.

998
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:05,460
- Easy, easy.
- Zach, what the fuck!

999
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,600
Jesus Christ.

1000
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,750
I'm gonna go inside and check on him.

1001
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:33,960
Shaun is really great, Jeanne.

1002
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:36,740
He really cares about Cody...
and me.

1003
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,510
If he can't be with you,
this is the next best thing.

1004
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,440
I'm gonna make it work.

1005
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:58,990
Jeanne, take a look around.

1006
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,810
Every kid should be so lucky.

1007
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,870
What else could you possibly want for him?

1008
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,080
I got into CalArts.

1009
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,300
I know.

1010
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,100
You know?

1011
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,340
Were you gonna tell me?

1012
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,850
They told me that you turned it down last time.

1013
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,480
I'm not going to again.

1014
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,930
No, you shouldn't.

1015
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:43,680
He'll be fine with us...

1016
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,940
Or stay, it's your choice.

1017
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,160
Zach, if this thing with Allen doesn't work out...

1018
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,930
It's best that he's here with you.

1019
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,660
He's in good hands I promise.

1020
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,450
Yeah.

1021
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,050
You ready?
