Sophie, what's up, girl?
Let me find out.

836
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,514
You got a lot of stuff going.
A lot of <i>sofrito</i> up in you.

837
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,920
Thank you.
You're not so bad yourself.

838
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,687
<i>Gracias, gracias.</i>
Moose, help me with these lights.

839
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,422
Mom's gonna kill me. Hurry up.

840
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,761
- Hurry up!
- Hold this. I'm coming.

841
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,158
Sophie, I'll do it, I'll do it.

842
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,704
I'll do it. You're welcome.

843
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,431
- [Andie] There we go.
- [Chase] This is really high.

844
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,773
No, it's not that bad.

845
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:46,943
- Yes, it is.
- No, we're good.

847
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,019
All right, this is gonna
sound cheesy, but...

848
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:02,927
...for what it's worth,
I'm really glad you're at MSA.

849
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,192
I think you were doing
just fine before I got there.

850
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,398
That's just the thing.
I mean, I've been trained to dance

851
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,805
since I first learned to walk.

852
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:17,335
But it's always been about
doing it their way and it's just not me.

853
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:22,350
But, ever since you came,
I feel more like myself.

854
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,554
- Oh, geez.
- [Laughs]

855
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,295
Well, I know what you mean.

856
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:38,428
My mom always used to tell me,
"Just be yourself."

857
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,233
When I was little
that sounded strange,

858
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,773
'cause I was like,
"How could I be anyone else?"

859
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:49,567
- I bet you miss her.
- Yeah.

860
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:59,185
When she got cancer, it was like
the floor fell from underneath.

861
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,883
I've just been running ever since.

862
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,358
But now I can't find my way back.

863
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,489
Well, maybe it's not about going back.

864
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,695
Maybe it's about being
right where you are.

I heard you was
dancing it up in there.

869
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,235
What, you not joking now?

870
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,411
Come on, guys,
I'm just trying to get home.

871
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,711
You thought it was real funny,
what you did the other day.

872
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,274
- Tuck, it's a joke.
- Look here.

873
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,446
Just 'cause you hang out with D
don't mean you got what it takes.

874
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,353
She don't know where she came from.

875
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,517
You don't know anything about her.

876
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,553
So now you defending her?

877
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,757
Yes, I am.
I'll see you at The Streets.

878
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,631
At The Streets?
You in the streets now.

Unless you want some more of us,

881
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,867
I suggest you stay away
from The Streets.

882
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,108
And stay farther away from Andie.
Drop this fool.

883
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,613
Come on, get up, fool.

01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,484
Get up!

885
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,420
Yeah. Ha.

are you, clown?

888
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:46,788
Hey, yo, Tuck.

889
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,983
Hey.

890
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,918
- Chase, what's going on?
- Hey.

891
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,983
- Hi.
- Hi.

892
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:18,049
How you doing? Is everything OK?

893
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,928
Yes, everything's OK.
Why wouldn't everything be OK?

894
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,401
- Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- Nothing. Nothing.

895
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,836
Don't worry. Listen,
I've got to get to class.

896
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,841
That is not nothing.
Who did this to you?

897
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:36,367
Just forget about it. Let it go.

898
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,496
Who did this?

899
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,502
Does anybody know
who is responsible for this?

900
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,744
This school will not be associated
with these competitions.

901
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,679
Any future involvement

902
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:49,445
by our students in The Streets
will lead to expulsion.

903
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:55,219
And anyone with any information
is expected to come forward.

904
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,423
Get this place cleaned up.

905
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,526
Man, I can't believe
they trashed the studio.

906
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,468
Now we have Director Collins
on our back.

907
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,336
- Glass is all over the floor.
- Somebody broke the stereo.

- [Moose] Graffiti was everywhere.
- What are we gonna do?

912
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:22,611
- We could get expelled.
- My parents would kill me

913
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,674
if I got expelled.

914
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,517

with regular kids.

I'm really sorry
that I got you all into this.

918

Andie, don't say that.

919
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,965
I put everything you guys
worked for at risk.

920
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,902
And it's not fair.

921
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,408
- We're all in on this together.
- Yeah, yeah.

922
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,534
No, it's over.

923
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:55,180
The crew's done. I don't know
what we were thinking.

924
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,879
Andie West, Director Collins
would like to see you.

925
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,739
By being involved in this
you've brought delinquent

926
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,475
behavior into my school
and put my students at risk.

927
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:29,017
And now the studio
has been vandalized.

928
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,678
It wasn't exactly like that.

929
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,748
I thought I could train you,

930
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,453
turn you into the dancer
that you could be.

931
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,687
But I was wrong.

932
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,891
There's nothing
that we can do for someone

933
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,457
who doesn't appreciate
what's in front of them.

934
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,165
I understand.

935
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,769
You know, I really did try.

936
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:03,312
I'm not done.

937
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,556
Was there anyone else involved
from this school?

938
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:11,719
No.

939
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,297
No one else. Just me.

940
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,663
Then I have no choice
but to expel you.

941
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,895
- But I didn't...
- I'm sorry.

942
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,700
That's it. I'm finished. Please leave.

I've been looking all over for you.

- What are we gonna do?
- It's done.

Everything's done.

947
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,894
I think it's pretty clear that
none of this was meant to be.

948
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,155
Whoa, Andie.

949
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,527
Don't do this.

950
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,930
Please just... Just let it go.

01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,516

- Mm-hmm

01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,562
I know I said things
would be different...

956
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:31,697
I know what happened.

957
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,800
No more excuses, Andie.
I'm sick and tired of this.

958
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:39,177
You're going to your aunt's
in Texas, and that's final.

959
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,421
It was my idea.

960
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,149
- Your idea for what?
- To compete in The Streets.

961
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,422
If you're gonna throw someone out
it should have been me.

962
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:54,861
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not throwing you out.

963
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,488
How would that make me look?

964
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:58,590
I'm not gonna let her
take the fall for this.

965
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,259
I should never have let her in.

966
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,964
It didn't benefit us in any way.

967
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,438
Not everything we do has to benefit us.

968
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:09,501
Some people, Andie in particular,
do what they love just because.

969
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,944
Isn't that why we started dancing
in the first place?

970
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:15,347
Look, I have a lot to do
for the fundraiser.

971
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,782
And so do you.

972
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:20,811

We're done here.

Let me just say something.

1098
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:34,408
The Streets are supposed to be about
different people coming together.

1099
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:38,843
We call this a battle,
but what are we fighting for?

1100

We're all here because we have
this thing we do. We dance.

1101
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,448
Right?

1102
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,926
Being a part of The Street
used to mean more than turf or power.

1103
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:49,691
It was about bringing
something new to the floor.

1104
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:54,257
And it shouldn't matter what we wear,

1105
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,600
what school
or what neighborhood we're from.

1106
01:22:56,671 --> 01:23:00,573
Because the best part of The Streets
is, it's not about what you've got.

1107
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,974
It's what you make of what you've got.

to defend their title against us,

1110
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,278

our thing where The Streets started.
