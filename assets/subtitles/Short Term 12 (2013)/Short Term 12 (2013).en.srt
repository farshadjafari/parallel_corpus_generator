00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,665
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Don't
worry about it.

3
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,265
On... on my first day, I forgot
everything that they taught me

4
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,365
in those classes.

5
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:39,332
NATE (OFFSCREEN): Really?

6
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,600
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,399
I mean, day one's always
a little tough.

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,066
It's like, you know, no matter
how the training goes,

9
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,832
there's... there's always room
for something that's just

10
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,866
totally unpredictable.

11
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:49,165
Oh, I...

12
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:50,332
I've got a pretty good
story for you if

13
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:51,332
you're ready for it.

14
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:52,600
NATE (OFFSCREEN): OK.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,765
JESSICA (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, what's up?

16
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,098
NATE (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,066
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Did
you guys meet?

18
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:56,765
NATE (OFFSCREEN): No.

19
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:57,700
Nate.

20
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:58,799
JESSICA (OFFSCREEN): Hi.

21
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,899
NATE (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

22
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,165
JESSICA (OFFSCREEN): Jessica.

23
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,665
MASON (OFFSCREEN):
OK, listen up.

24
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,399
So it's like my first week
on the job, and I'm

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,500
at gate duty, right?

26
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,365
NATE (OFFSCREEN): What's that?

27
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,066
If a kid wants to leave,
legally we can't stop them, so

28
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,465
we put someone at the gate to
try and talk them out of it.

29
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:12,867
Whoa, you got here quick.

30
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:13,799
I did.

31
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:14,867
Good morning.

32
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:15,832
Hi.

33
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:16,765
Nate, this is Grace.

34
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:17,234
She's your new boss.

35
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:17,932
Hello.

36
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:18,900
Hey.

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,799
Hi, nice to meet you.

38
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,132
Nice to meet you.

39
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,799
I would lose the tie
if I were you.

40
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,332
And if you're listening to a
story of Mason's, understand

41
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,998
that there's very little
reality in it.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,198
Hey, don't piss in the water
before we put our toes in.

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,765
It actually feels
pretty mellow.

44
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,066
MASON (OFFSCREEN): OK, so Grace,
my wonderful new boss

45
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:36,599
at the time, she leaves me at
my gate duty for like three

46
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,432
hours without a bathroom break.

47
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,132
And I'm dying because I ate
the tacos that they serve

48
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,932
here, and she failed
to tell me that

49
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,466
they're a known laxative.

50
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:48,765
So this kid, 16 years old, this
big fuckin' intimidating

51
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:50,633
dude, he's like a foot
taller than me.

52
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,866
He walks up and he just
cruises out the gate.

53
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:56,365
It's my second day, so
I don't know what the

54
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,900
hell is going on.

55
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,031
But Grace, she's standing
right there, and she

56
00:01:59,033 --> 00:01:59,998
just lets it happen.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
Whatever.

58
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,900
What I saw was Mason just
sitting there and Wesley

59
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,599
smiling at me from the opposite
side of the gate

60
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,566
because he knows that
we can't touch him.

61
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,998
Why not?

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,866
Once they're a foot outside the
gate, we can't touch them.

63
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:13,998
So Grace tells me to follow
him, so I do for hours, just

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,932
walking eight feet behind him.

65
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,966
Eventually he gets on this bus,
so I get on the bus too.

66
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,800
And at this point I can't think
of anything but whatever

67
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,733
the hell these tacos are
doing to my bowels.

68
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,699
So I make up my mind,
fuck this.

69
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,699
I've got to get off at the next
stop or I'm going to lose

70
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,500
it in my shorts in front
of all these people.

71
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,832
And exactly as I make this
decision, Wesley leans his

72
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,599
big-ass head over to me from
across the aisle, and he says,

73
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,066
really calm, I'm getting off at
the next stop, and if you

74
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:43,199
do too, I'm going to rip your
fuckin' balls off and feed

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,165
them to you.

76
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,365
Holy shit.

77
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,432
Remember what I said.

78
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,866
Hey now, this part is true.

79
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,599
I was there.

80
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,432
Really?

81
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,265
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Mm-hmm.

82
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,199
Are you sure?

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,098
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

84
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:52,900
So the bus stops.

85
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:53,699
He gets off.

86
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,066
I wait a second.

87
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,900
I go over to the door, but he's
just standing there on

88
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,699
the sidewalk like 10 feet away,
staring at me, waiting.

89
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,432
What can I do?

90
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,399
I have no other choice.

91
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,233
So I step off the bus.

92
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:06,633
And the second that my feet
touch the ground, it is like a

93
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:11,265
knot in my asshole untied, and
the fiesta in my stomach just

94
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,098
comes pouring down my legs.

95
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,265
[laughter]

96
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:19,500
So I'm just standing there,
shit gushing down my thighs.

97
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:21,866
I ruined my fuckin'
favorite Nikes.

98
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:25,432
And Wesley is just there,
doubled over, losing it.

99
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,466
And he's fuckin' laughing
so hard.

100
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,699
I've never seen anything...

101
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,299
[screaming]

102
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,199
[alarm blaring]

103
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,165
Here we go, Nate.

104
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,399
Wait, what?

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,098
Come on, Nate!

106
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,765
Go.

107
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,765
[screaming]

108
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:37,932
Sammy!

109
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,332
[screaming]

110
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,900
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Sammy!

111
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,866
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

112
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:42,900
Hey.

113
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,199
GRACE (OFFSCREEN):
Whoa, I got him.

114
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,299
Let go, you fucking perverts!

115
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,399
OK.

116
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,466
Nate, grab his feet, please.

117
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,132
[screaming]

118
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,165
Just going to sit down here in
the grass for a while until

119
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,533
you de-escalate.

120
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,199
Deescalate my asshole,
you duck fuckers!

121
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,299
I'm not quite sure what
you mean by that.

122
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,265
You know the drill, Sammy.

123
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,998
Just let it pass.

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
[screaming]

125
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,866
You all right, buddy?

126
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,299
Whoa, he got pretty
far that time.

127
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,932
I think it's a new record.

128
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:17,699
So anyway, after all that he
ends up coming back with me,

129
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,867
but only because he's so excited
to tell everyone in

130
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,332
our unit that I pooped
my pants.

131
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,500
And he does.

132
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,766
He tells everyone.

133
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,699
Somehow it even got
back to my mom.

134
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,298
You heard that story,
right Sammy?

135
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,565
Yeah.

136
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,066
How are you guys doing
over there?

137
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,132
Fantastic.

138
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:34,066
How are you feeling, Sammy?

139
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,332
You got it all out?

140
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,365
You want to go take a nap?

141
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,867
All right, let's get you up.

142
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,899
MASON (OFFSCREEN):
Up we go, bud.

143
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:44,098
All right, I'll see you
back at the office.

144
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,533
[inaudible], man.

145
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,334
All right.

146
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,699
This guy's been eating his
Wheaties in the morning.

147
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,899
Have you ever thought about
the Olympics, Sammy?

148
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,867
Running track?

149
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:01,399
[music playing]

150
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,932
These are the files on our
kids, if you want to see what

151
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,533
kind of crap they've
been through.

152
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,233
How long do they stay here?

153
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,332
Supposedly less than a year,
but we have a few that have

154
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:37,867
been here a little over three.

155
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,733
We just keep them until the
county figures out where

156
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,298
they're going to go next.

157
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,432
Tom!

158
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:45,432
Go brush your teeth!

159
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,966
Mmm.

160
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,233
Remember, you are
not their parent.

161
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,932
You are not their therapist.

162
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,832
You are here to create a safe
environment, and that's it.

163
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,365
Got it.

164
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:55,632
And since you're new, they're
going to try and test you, see

165
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:56,699
what they can get away with.

166
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,298
So just say no for a while.

167
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,800
No.

168
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,999
OK.

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,132
Kind of got to be an
asshole before you

170
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,132
can be their friend.

171
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,665
You're going to be fine.

172
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,199
Community meeting is
in five minutes!

173
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,632
Luis, you better be up.

174
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,533
LUIS (OFFSCREEN): Ugh,
I don't want to be.

175
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,632
So this is how it's
going to be?

176
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:26,065
You've got five seconds.

177
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,667
[speaking spanish].

178
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,365
Fuck!

179
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,298
Aah!

180
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,332
Aah!

181
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,266
Luis!

182
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,800
[speaking spanish].

183
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
LUIS (OFFSCREEN):
[speaking spanish].

184
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,332
I love you too.

185
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,132
That's not cool.

186
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,266
Kendra, will you be secretary
for us today?

187
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,565
Sure, I guess.

188
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,266
GRACE (OFFSCREEN):
OK, thank you.

189
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:10,399
Community meeting is
now in session.

190
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,199
Community announcements?

191
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,298
No announcements?

192
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,899
What's going on, you guys?

193
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:21,332
You look a little dead.

194
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,365
What did you do to them?

195
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,533
I don't know.

196
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:25,766
I farted when I was outside.

197
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,632
Maybe some of it
followed me in.

198
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,165
Did you shart yourself again?

199
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,633
No, Luis, I did not shart,
thank you very much.

200
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:35,365
And that happened one time,
and you weren't

201
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:36,633
even here yet, so.

202
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:37,665
It's still funny.

203
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,633
OK, are we done?

204
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,099
I've...

205
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,399
I've heard that story like
three times today.

206
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,365
Yeah, but it's a good story.

207
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,665
It is a good story.

208
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,665
OK, if no one has any
non-poop related

209
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,566
announcements, I have one.

210
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:51,265
As most of you are already
aware, Marcus is turning 18

211
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,799
and will be leaving us.

212
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,332
Can I have his room?

213
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,466
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): We are going
to be throwing him a

214
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:56,899
little party next week.

215
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,734
Marcus, any requests?

216
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,799
Can I shave my head?

217
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,600
I was talking about
food for the party.

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,500
No, I don't.

219
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,633
I don't want food.

220
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,667
I want to shave my head.

221
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,298
OK.

222
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,399
As long as I hold the razor.

223
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,899
Cool.

224
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,399
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): OK, everyone
else, thoughts?

225
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,765
Food for Marcus' party, what
are we going to do?

226
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,399
[interposing voices]

227
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,533
OK, OK.

228
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,032
Everyone, one at
a time, please.

229
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,932
Luis, thank you for
raising your hand.

230
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,932
Who's the weird guy over there?

231
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,432
GRACE (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, that is Nate.

232
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,365
Please do not be jerks to him.

233
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,665
It is his first day.

234
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,399
Do you want to introduce
yourself?

235
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,432
Um, sure.

236
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,500
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Great.

237
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,165
Yeah.

238
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,099
Hey.

239
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,332
Uh, as you know,
my name's Nate.

240
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,966
And, uh, I just...

241
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,966
I took a year off of school
because, you know, I just

242
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,131
wanted to get some
life experience.

243
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,999
And I always wanted to work
with underprivileged kids.

244
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,666
Hey, what the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

245
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,032
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Marcus,
settle down.

246
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,298
No, I want to know what
you mean by that,

247
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,799
"underprivileged."

248
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,365
That's not what I meant.

249
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,633
Then think about your fucking
words before you speak!

250
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:11,466
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Hey!

251
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,432
Newbie!

252
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,232
That's a level drop.

253
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,299
Go to your room.

254
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,234
Go to your room.

255
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,900
Sorry, man.

256
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,767
Sorry.

257
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:35,533
Um, levels and feelings,
you know the drill.

258
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,399
Let's start with you, Luis.

259
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,533
Green.

260
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:39,633
Fine.

261
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:40,399
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Silver.

262
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,533
Whatever.

263
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,500
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Yellow.

264
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,832
I feel funny.

265
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:44,600
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Green.

266
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,700
All right.

267
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:46,365
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Yellow.

268
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,365
Annoyed.

269
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:51,432
[phone ringing]

270
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,366
Short Term 12, this is Grace.

271
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,799
Right now?

272
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,899
[phone ringing]

273
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,166
So what do you think?

274
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:03,799
Hmm?

275
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,666
The new lamp.

276
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,232
It's really a trip.

277
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,432
You can turn it on and off by
touching the metal part.

278
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,234
Try it.

279
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:19,566
Cool, huh?

280
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,298
Hmm.

281
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,932
Look, I'm supposed to be in a
group session like right now.

282
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,399
You mind if we walk and talk?

283
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,500
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): No.

284
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,932
This is Jayden.

285
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,198
She just got appointed
to us this morning.

286
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
Her father's a friend
of a friend, real

287
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,432
nice guy, very cultured.

288
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:36,399
Why isn't she with him?

289
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,099
Oh, he lost his wife
a few years back.

290
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,832
Jayden hasn't made life
very easy on him.

291
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,066
For the past couple of years,
she's been in and out of group

292
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:47,131
homes for dangerous behavior.

293
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:50,399
Last week she bit her
therapist's nose.

294
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,765
Great.

295
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,600
Yeah, so we'll have her during
the week, but she gets

296
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,332
weekend home visits.

297
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,566
All right.

298
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,700
I told her father we'd
take good care of her.

299
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,432
I take good care of everyone.

300
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,999
I know you do.

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,399
That's why I'm trusting you to
do the same with Jayden.

302
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,500
When does she get here?

303
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,900
She might be here already.

304
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,700
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): I like
your name, Jayden.

305
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,666
It's a boy's name.

306
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,332
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Really?

307
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,633
I don't think so.

308
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,267
Will Smith did.

309
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,332
OK, well, these things you
can't keep in your room, but

310
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,131
we'll keep them in the closet
out here, and you can check

311
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,665
them out whenever
you want them.

312
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,232
Yep, I know the rules.

313
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:45,566
No belts, no razors, no
scissors, no fuckin' freedom.

314
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,365
No cussing.

315
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,399
Shit, I forgot about that one.

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,298
I'm going to let that one slip
because it was clever.

317
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,032
All right.

318
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,234
Let's go see your room.

319
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,700
Here it is.

320
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,166
Wow, it's so inviting.

321
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,633
You can put whatever you want
on the walls as long as it's

322
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:07,866
appropriate.

323
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,066
So no pictures of penises?

324
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:14,500
Not unless it's very
scientific.

325
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,432
Oh, wow.

326
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:17,999
This is really cool.

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,365
JAYDEN (OFFSCREEN):
No, that's crap.

328
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,933
If you call that crap,
I'm jealous.

329
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,399
If you put your clothes outside
the door before

330
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,432
bedtime, the overnighters
will wash them.

331
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:38,665
And, um, you can't keep
your door closest.

332
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,165
I don't do that anymore.

333
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,732
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): I'm not
saying that you do.

334
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,332
I mean, even if I ever did want
to cut myself, keeping

335
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:44,866
the fuckin' door cracked
isn't going to stop me.

336
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,165
I already warned you
about cussing.

337
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,700
That one's going to
be a level drop.

338
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,732
Oh no, a level drop.

339
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:51,700
What am I going to do?

340
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:55,000
Your attitude is not helping
either one of us.

341
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,433
[music playing]

342
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,732
Hey, what happened to that guy?

343
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,165
What guy?

344
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,365
The big kid that made
you poop your pants.

345
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,232
Wesley.

346
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:37,566
Yeah.

347
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,700
He ran away again, and then two
days later someone found

348
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:41,765
him dead in the bushes.

349
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,066
What?

350
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,899
That is the real ending
to the story.

351
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,566
I don't like that part.

352
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:49,765
Sugar, coming with me?

353
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,032
I'm going to clear my head.

354
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,700
That was a good first
day, Nate.

355
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,500
Thank you.

356
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,099
See ya.

357
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,032
All right, man.

358
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:58,832
Yeah, take it easy.

359
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,765
All right.

360
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,033
I'll see you tomorrow.

361
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:07,200

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,533
Grace?

363
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,133
Come on in, Hon.

364
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,200
So the test did come
back positive.

365
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,799
Lovely.

366
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,600
How are you feeling?

367
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:42,866
I already did, like, seven of
those tests at home, so I'm

368
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:45,298
not really surprised.

369
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,365
OK, well, you have a few
options to explore.

370
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:49,799
And we can go over it for...

371
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,600
We can just make an appointment
for Saturday.

372
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,967
You don't want to hear
the other options?

373
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,500
Uhuh.

374
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:02,967
OK.

375
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,600
Have you ever been
pregnant before?

376
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,298
One time.

377
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,100
NURSE (OFFSCREEN): OK.

378
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,600
Hey, stinker, what
took you so long?

379
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,799
Oh, no.

380
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,633
I didn't know you still
had that stupid hat.

381
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,832
I will always have
this stupid hat.

382
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,500
What's going on in here?

383
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,765
Well, since you were out
cheating on me with your bike,

384
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,665
I decided I'd make myself some
chiles rellenos, homemade

385
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,032
tortillas, and my mom's
famous salsa.

386
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:53,265
Mmm.

387
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:54,765
Looks like there's
enough for two.

388
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,700
All right.

389
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:57,099
I doubt it.

390
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,533
Mase, you don't have to
be jealous of Floyd.

391
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,365
Floyd?

392
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,399
Your bike has a name now?

393
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,298
Of course he does.

394
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,766
We're very close.

395
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,799
I don't know what
you see in him.

396
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,665
Mmm.

397
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,532
Nice grip.

398
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:09,833
Comfy seat.

399
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:13,298
There is no way his seat
is as comfy as mine.

400
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,665
You're right.

401
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,833
I think I'm going to
go take a shower.

402
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,566
Floyd got me all sweaty.

403
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,799
MASON (OFFSCREEN):
I hate that bike!

404
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,400
Fuck you, Floyd.

405
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:37,999
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): OK,
I'm done with mine.

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,665
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Oh, yeah.

407
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,031
OK, yep.

408
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:42,766
Almost there.

409
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,298
Um.

410
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,232
Those are some crazy
last-minute changes you're

411
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,566
making.

412
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,098
Yeah, well, I really
suck at noses.

413
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,067
OK, you go first.

414
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,398
Aw, damn it.

415
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,633
Yours are always so good.

416
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:02,700
Thanks.

417
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,266
I look like a homeless
guy, though.

418
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,833
You do kind of look like
a homeless guy.

419
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,900
Oh yeah, thank you.

420
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,599
What's that on my face there?

421
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:10,566
Oh, that?

422
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,067
Yep.

423
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,732
Mmm.

424
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,165
Well, that's the piece of
avocado that's in your beard.

425
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:14,900
No.

426
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:15,665
Yes.

427
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, fuck.

428
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,566
Yes.

429
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,566
It's been there the whole time.

430
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,599
Ooh, yeah.

431
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,098
So now you're all
nicely painted.

432
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:21,799
Thank you for saying
something...

433
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,267
sooner.

434
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:22,932
I did.

435
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,700
I just...

436
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:25,532
OK.

437
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,266
Um, all right, here we go.

438
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,031
Just take it easy, OK, because
you're going to freak out when

439
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:30,298
you see this.

440
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,999
I think it might be
my best one yet.

441
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,900
OK.

442
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,833
[laughter]

443
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:37,766
Hmm?

444
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:39,098
Come on.

445
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:40,132
Oh, wow.

446
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,199
You can't fuck with that.

447
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,866
I can't fuck with that.

448
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,266
That nose is amazing.

449
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,932
Yeah.

450
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:50,398
And I was going for kind of a
mushroomy thing in there.

451
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,833
Is that a beard?

452
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:52,633
No.

453
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:54,199
I was, uh...

454
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,633
I was trying to shade.

455
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,900
I think it looks pretty cool.

456
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,900
Yeah, it looks very cool.

457
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:00,333
What's growing out of my head?

458
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:01,700
Oh, these?

459
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:02,200
Flowers.

460
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:03,900
Mmm.

461
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,066
They represent the peculiar
thoughts that grow out of your

462
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,666
gorgeous mind.

463
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,634
Why are you so nice to me?

464
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,833
You being serious now?

465
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,098
Mmhmm.

466
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,500
Well, it's easy.

467
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,633
It's because you are the
weirdest, most beautiful

468
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:31,334
person that I've ever met
in my whole entire life.

469
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,932
Whoa.

470
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:50,932
Hmm?

471
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,532
Um.

472
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:53,866
Nothing.

473
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:57,098
It's just been a long time since
you kissed me like that.

474
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,999
That's not true.

475
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,567
Well, we haven't had sex
in 9 days and 13 hours.

476
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:10,967
Down to the hour, huh?

477
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,567
Did I do something?

478
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,298
No.

479
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,866
You're wonderful.

480
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,467
What is it, then?

481
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:25,298
Hey.

482
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,932
Hey, hey.

483
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:30,066
Please, you have to let me in
your head once in a while or

484
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,633
I'm just going to go nuts, OK?

485
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,233
Shh.

486
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,933
Are you doing this just for me?

487
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,298
You OK?

488
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:56,999
Yes.

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
Yeah?

490
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,834
You don't want me to stop?

491
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,199
Stop.

492
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,900
Why?

493
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:22,366
Stop!

494
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,799
Ow!

495
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,433
Shit.

496
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,467
What the hell, Grace?

497
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,900
OK, everyone.

498
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,398
I think most of you have already
met her, but we have a

499
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,833
new member of our community.

500
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:30,066
Jayden, would you introduce
yourself?

501
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,700
Um.

502
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,967
Please don't be offended if I'm
not very friendly, but I'm

503
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:37,833
going to be living with my dad
soon, and I don't really like

504
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,833
wasting time on short-term
relationships.

505
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:43,866
So, you know, it's
nothing personal.

506
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:44,900
Wow.

507
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,566
She seems like a really
nice girl.

508
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,232
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
I think we all can

509
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,866
respect her space, OK?

510
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:52,298
OK, what do we want to
play for rec today?

511
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,333
Wiffle ball, dude!

512
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,232
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): OK.

513
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,633
No, man.

514
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:56,932
You're always playing
that stupid game.

515
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:58,532
Because you always suck at it.

516
00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:59,833
Until you get good at
it, maybe we could

517
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:00,599
stop playing it.

518
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:01,999
Watch your mouth, bro.

519
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,232
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Both
of you, cut it out.

520
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,834
Any other suggestions?

521
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,266
Yes, Sammy?

522
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,031
Can we play Big and Small?

523
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:13,465
Is that a real game, or is that
a game you just made up?

524
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,532
It's a real game that
I just made up.

525
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:18,365
[snickering]

526
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,866
OK.

527
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,834
Well, maybe you can explain
that to me later.

528
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,599
Straight line, guys.

529
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:31,199
I'm going to do room checks,
so I'll meet you.

530
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,601
Oh, OK.

531
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:34,733
Hi, Nas.

532
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,398
Come on, guys.

533
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,132
Let's go, Shawnta, let's go!

534
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,766
All right, we got
a baseball game.

535
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,333
There you go.

536
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:06,365
You got this.

537
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,066
[cheering]

538
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,398
Sammy.

539
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,333
Hey, yo, Sammy.

540
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,532
Get... get the ball!

541
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:13,132
Run, girl, run!

542
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,133
NATE (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, Sammy!

543
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:20,633
You too good for this game?

544
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:21,932
What?

545
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:25,333
Too good for wiffle ball?

546
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:28,031
I don't like sweat.

547
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:29,398
Hey, you know what, Connor?

548
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,500
Just come... just come closer.

549
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,532
It's Marcus.

550
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:32,932
He ain't going to hit it.

551
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:34,199
You sure you don't want
to get the fat bat?

552
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,601
No?

553
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,599
Strike one, everybody.

554
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,532
Strike one.

555
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:40,799
That wasn't no strike.

556
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,932
That was right down the middle.

557
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:42,900
This is the big leagues, boy.

558
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,999
You can't handle it?

559
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,165
Better keep flapping them gums.

560
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,066
Hey.

561
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,098
You want to jump rope with us?

562
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,500
Um.

563
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,299
No?

564
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,432
Sorry.

565
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,834
We're not supposed to.

566
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,633
That's not what we meant.

567
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:05,634
Can I hear?

568
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,633
LUIS (OFFSCREEN): Strike three.

569
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,266
Change it up.

570
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,666
Bet your ma is real excited
to see you next week, huh?

571
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,799
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Marcus!

572
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,732
What the fuck?

573
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,365
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Hey!

574
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,398
What the fuck did you about
my mama, you little bitch?

575
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,066
Hey!

576
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:43,799
Hey!

577
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,066
What are you doing?

578
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,599
Get your ass over to the bench.

579
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:47,665
MASON (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, come on.

580
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,932
Guys, get Luis out of here.

581
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:49,700
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Is Marcus OK?

582
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:50,500
You good?

583
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,298
Yeah, I got it.

584
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:51,967
Luis, come on.

585
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:53,266
Come on.

586
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:54,566
OK, where... where where...
where does it hurt?

587
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,500
JESSICA (OFFSCREEN): Come on.

588
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,031
Come on, sit over here.

589
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,833
We're going to sit down for
a little while, OK?

590
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:58,633
You OK, man?

591
00:26:58,634 --> 00:26:59,432
How do you feel?

592
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:00,532
Not good.

593
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:01,665
I mean, that... that was crazy.

594
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:04,232
They just fight like that?

595
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:09,532
Nate, I'm not asking you
how you're feeling.

596
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,298
Right.

597
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,566
I'm sorry.

598
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,366
How are you?

599
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,767
You need to tell me what
the hell is going on.

600
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,834
[sigh]

601
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,098
Assault and drug possession.

602
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,566
You realize that's enough to get
your ass thrown in juvie.

603
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,031
Do you think I give a fuck?

604
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,200
You're out of here in
less than a week.

605
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,834
You're so much smarter
than this.

606
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,599
I know it's scary out there.

607
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,700
I ain't scared of shit.

608
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:09,398
All I'm saying is, getting
thrown in jail is not what you

609
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,800
want to do.

610
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,867
My dad has been in there
for 10 years.

611
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,867
I don't want that for you.

612
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,833
Straight to your room.

613
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:47,799
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): No
free time until all

614
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,133
your chores are done.

615
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,700
What's going on with him?

616
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:56,500
He doesn't want to leave.

617
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,566
Should I go talk to him?

618
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,566
Yeah.

619
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,398
All right, I'll just be inside
letting Marcus kick the

620
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,298
shit out of me.

621
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:09,901
Have fun.

622

[hip-hop music playing]

624
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:22,767
You got some new lyrics you
want to try out on me?

625
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,999
There's a lot of fucks in it.

626
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
I won't tell.

627
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:36,999
Mm-hmm.

628
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,199
Those are pretty much it.

629
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,967
It's slow.

630
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:41,066
All right, let's see.

631
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:42,867
Let's see here.

632
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:48,532
Like that?

633
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:51,633
Yeah.

634
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:54,132
All right.

635
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,599
(RAPPING) It don't matter
now, damn near 18.

636
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,900
All the pretty pictures in
my fuckin' head is faded.

637
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:03,098
And when I think about that
trick that raised me, I think

638
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,599
about sick, because the
bitch is crazy.

639
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,165
Fuck that bitch, nigga,
fuck that pain.

640
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,398
Your body's in a ditch inside
this turned up brain.

641
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,298
I mean, I can't see how you
claim it, you being ma?

642
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:14,833
Doctors snatched me out

evil with eagle claws.

644
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,532
Ho, ho, ho, slut, fuck
the way you want it.

645
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:21,500
Got your young, dumb son
pitching pigeons for money.

646
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,900
I mean, it's colder than the
bitch when it's sunny.

647
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:25,398
Blows raining down on the glow.

648
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,432
Got the nerve to tell
me you love me?

649
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:28,365
I said, again?

650
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:28,999
Again?

651
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,833
Sell it again?

652
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,298
Bitch, I'm 10.

653
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,599
Let me go outside and function
with friends.

654
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,599
You say you ma?

655
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:34,700
You mother?

656
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,098
You the father-fucking queen?

657
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,132
I say, all right, I love
her so I flip it again.

658
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:41,066
No, not this time, bitch,
because I'm stronger than you.

659
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:43,298
Not this time, bitch, swinging
harder than you.

660
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,098
No, not this time, bitch, you
ain't leave me a choice.

661
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:49,066
You just a body in a ditch
in the brain of a boy.

662
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,365
All fucked up now,
damn near 18.

663
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:54,599
All the pictures in my past
ain't never fading.

664
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:57,298
I'm always wishing for something
amazing, but when

665
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,799
your life is shit then
it ain't no trading.

666
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,633
So put me in your book so you
know what it's like to live a

667
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:05,333
life not knowing what a
normal life's like.

668
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:08,199
Put a label on my head so you
know what it's like to live a

669
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,031
life not knowing what a
normal life's like.

670
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:13,633
Look into my eyes so you
know what it's like.

671
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:16,266
Look into my eyes so you
know what it's like.

672
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:19,165
Look into my eyes so you know
what it's like to live a life

673
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:22,032
not knowing what a normal
life's like.

674
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:37,365
Yeah, I...

675
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:37,932
I don't...

676
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,031
I don't...

677
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:41,067
I don't know what to say, man.

678
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:43,200
It's cool, man.

679
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,267
I just need to shave my head.

680
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:52,233
You think Grace will
still shave it?

681
00:31:57,767 --> 00:31:59,400
I like the new wall decor.

682
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,031
JAYDEN (OFFSCREEN): Thanks.

683
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:06,366
They're actually very
informative.

684
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,933
Can I draw with you?

685
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:32,866
When I was 9 or 10, I used to
draw portraits of all my mom's

686
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,665
boyfriends.

687
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,433
And then I'd sell them to
her for $10 apiece.

688
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:43,333
How many boyfriends
did she have?

689
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:46,532
Enough that I was able to save
up and buy one of those

690
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:51,665
portable CD players with
anti-shock protection.

691
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,098
You're old.

692
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:54,031
Whatever.

693
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:55,233
Those things were cool.

694
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,200
You know what's weird?

695
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:06,700
Whenever I was drawing portraits
of, you know, those

696
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:11,732
guys, I would always
take forever.

697
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:15,566
30, 40 minutes just stringing
them along, saying, oh, I've

698
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:19,799
just got to do a couple
more shadows, or, I'm

699
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,400
just fixing the nose.

700
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,932
I don't know why I did that.

701
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,733
I hated every single
one of them.

702
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,299
Maybe you were just trying to
keep them away from your mom.

703
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,166
Yeah.

704
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,299
Maybe.

705
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:51,132
Are you done?

706
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,500
Almost.

707
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,665
I've just got to add
a few shadows and

708
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,900
fix the nose a little.

709
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,866
You are such a smartass.

710
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,298
That's a level drop.

711
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,665
Oh no, not a level drop.

712
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,866
I wanted to play
foosball later.

713
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,066
JAYDEN (OFFSCREEN): Hmm.

714
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:09,467
Too bad.

715
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:41,932
OK.

716
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:44,333
Finished.

717
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,166
You want to take a look?

718
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,733
Looks great, Marcus.

719
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,333
Check it out.

720
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,701
Is it lumpy?

721
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,666
What do you mean?

722
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,666
I usually keep my hair long.

723
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:12,065
It's where she used
to hit me at.

724
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,666
Is it still lumpy?

725
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:19,599
No way, man.

726
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,365
Not at all.

727
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,166
See for yourself.

728
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,132
Pretty smooth.

729
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:46,266
What about the back?

730
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:47,065
No scars?

731
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,900
No...

732
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,298
no nothing?

733
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,266
Uhuh.

734
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,867
It looks really great.

00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:09,233
Mason.

737
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:10,833
Hmm?

738
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,766
I have something to tell you.

739
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:22,233
Yeah?

740
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:23,833
What's up?

741
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:36,333
(WHISPERING) We're going
to have a baby.

742
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,701
[chuckling]

743
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,532
What?

744
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,434
We're going to have a baby.

745
00:37:56,266 --> 00:37:57,867
We are?

746
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:00,867
Mmhmm.

747
00:38:03,132 --> 00:38:05,666
Whoa.

748
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:07,300
Whoa.

749
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,132
Whoa.

750
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:13,266
OK.

751
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:14,833
Um.

752
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,800
Um.

753
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:26,233
Um.

754
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,833
Uh, give me a minute.

755
00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:33,733
Oh, boy!

756
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,766
Holy shit.

757
00:38:37,766 --> 00:38:39,766
Whoa!

758
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:40,233
OK.

759
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:40,900
OK.

760
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,367
OK.

761
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:54,501
Hey.

762
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,800
You know we can do this, right?

763
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:06,132
Because we are going to be
some amazing parents.

764
00:39:06,132 --> 00:39:07,733
OK?

765
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,067
I love you so much, Grace.

766
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:17,434
So much it's insane.

767
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:36,199
Let me see.

768
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,398
Hmm?

769
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,365
You can't tell yet.

770
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,367
Come on.

771
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:54,733
That is so crazy.

772
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,766
Hmm.

773
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,199
Did you hear about Sammy?

774
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,632
What?

775
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:59,065
Last night they took
all his dolls away.

776
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:03,632
His therapist is calling it
a lesson in letting go.

777
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:04,867
Bullshit.

778
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:08,465
Those are all his
sisters, right?

779
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,467
He's not ready for that.

780
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,534
It's time for your meds, Sammy.

781
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:34,634
I'm sorry, bud.

782
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,766
Jayden, meds.

783
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:47,699
How'd you sleep?

784
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:49,432
Like crap.

785
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:51,900
Can you tell the doctor I need
a higher dosage of Trazodone?

786
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,199
Mmhmm, I will tell him.

787
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:58,501
Happy birthday.

788
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:06,599
And it comes with this.

789
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:08,601
Mason made that.

790
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,967
Thanks.

791
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,800
I heard your dad's
picking you up.

792
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,465
Yep.

793
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:22,266
You excited?

794
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,132
Whatever.

795
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:05,233
WOMAN (ON LOUDSPEAKER): Dan,
you have a visitor at the

796
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,233
front gate.

797
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,666
Dan to the front gate.

800
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:25,632
Bye, Shawnta.

Bye.

802
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:27,632

[music playing]

809
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,298
NARRATOR (ON TV): The fact that
this occurs on the eve of

810
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,733
the summer solstice
left me wondering.

811

812
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,500
Damn it.

Will you watch the kids?

00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:04,800
Sure.

Jayden.

817
00:45:16,701 --> 00:45:20,932
Come on, you know you can't
keep the door closed.

818
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:22,500
Stop pushing on the door.

819
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,699
Hey.

820
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:24,833
Hey, Jade.

821
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,500
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

822
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:27,465
Why can't she close her door?

823
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:28,967
She's a cutter.

824
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:30,500
JAYDEN (OFFSCREEN): I can
fucking hear you, dick!

825
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,599
Maybe I'll just cut myself right
now, and you'll all lose

826
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,532
your fucking jobs!

827

Please Just. Open the door.

833
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,065
If you just open the
door, then we

834
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:45,565

have to force it.

Sorry, how's that?

855

Let me go!

856
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:20,132
You shouldn't be here, Grace.

857
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,666
What's wrong, Mason?

858
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,666
Can't handle me for yourself,
you weak-ass fuck?

859
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:25,666
Need the bitch to
do it for you?

860

Hold her good, Nate.

You're going to be OK, Jayden.

866

It's going to be OK.

867
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:40,632

That's fine.

00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:47,766
You don't have to like
me right now.

873
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,567
Just let it pass.

874
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:53,733
How we doing, Nate?

875
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:55,666
Not so good.

876
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:57,733
You're doing good.

877
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:59,534
You're doing really good.

How is she?

882
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:19,967
I guess she's in the
cool-down room now.

00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:21,567
I need that.

found here in abundance.

886
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:31,666
In fact, Scotland is home to 40%

Shit.

Slipped and cut too deep.

I went to live with
my dad and...

00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,632
it's impossible to worry about
anything else when there's

OK.

991
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,998
Once upon a time, somewhere
miles and miles beneath the

992
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,233
surface of the ocean,
there lived a young

993
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:22,166
octopus named Nina.

994
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:25,666
Nina spent most of her time
alone making strange creations

995
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:27,532
out of rocks and shells.

996
00:56:27,534 --> 00:56:30,666
And she was very happy.

997
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:34,766
But then on Monday the
shark showed up.

998
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,298
"What's your name?"
said the shark.

999
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,065
"Nina," she replied.

1000
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:42,233
"Do you want to be my
friend?" he asked.

1001
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,465
"OK.

1002
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,432
"What do I have to
do?" said Nina.

1003
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:47,998
"Not much," said the shark.

1004
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,065
"Just let me eat one
of your arms."

1005
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:54,900
Nina had never had a friend
before, so she wondered if

1006
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,099
this was what you had
to do to get one.

1007
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:01,199
She looked down at her eight
arms and decided it wouldn't

1008
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:02,967
be so bad to give up one.

1009
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:06,467
So she donated an arm to her
wonderful new friend.

1010
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,132
Wow.

1011
00:57:11,132 --> 00:57:13,833
Every day that week, Nina and
the shark would play together.

1012
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:17,632
They explored caves, built
castles of sand, and swam

1013
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,932
really, really fast.

1014
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:23,099
And every night the shark would
be hungry, and Nina

1015
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,634
would give him another one
of her arms to eat.

1016
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:34,333
On Sunday, after playing all
day, the shark told Nina that

1017
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,500
he was very hungry.

1018
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,398
"I don't understand," she said.

1019
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,266
"I've already given you six of
my arms, and now you want one

1020
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:45,365
"more?" The shark looked at her
with a friendly smile and

1021
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:48,032
said, "I don't want one."

1022
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:54,900
This time I want them all."
"But why?" Nina asked.

1023
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,298
And the shark replied, "because
that's what friends"

1024
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:57,911
are for."

1025
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:06,833
When the shark finished
his meal, he felt

1026
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,298
very sad and lonely.

1027
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,032
He missed having someone to
explore caves, build castles,

1028
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,534
and swim really, really
fast with.

1029
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,298
He missed Nina very much.

1030
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,599
So he...

1031
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:26,199

another friend.

Um.

1097

That was someone from the
probation department.

1098

They said that your dad's
probably going to get released

He thinks Luis had something
to do with it.

1112

Did he?

1113
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:43,800
Tell me you didn't do something
to Marcus' fish.

I don't know what you're
talking about.

I swear!

1118
01:07:01,867 --> 01:07:03,467
I'm really sorry, Marcus.

1119
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,532
It wasn't Luis.

you need anything.

night and took her on pass for

He apologized.

He had a personal emergency.

That's not even the
point, Jack.

1139
01:08:18,868 --> 01:08:20,600
Did you read my report?

1140
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,432
JACK (OFFSCREEN): Of course I
did, and I was very concerned.

1141
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:25,233
But when Jayden's social worker
asked her about it, she

1142
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,998
said her father had never
been abusive in any way.

1143
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,198
Of course she said that.

1144
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:30,765
She's fucking scared!

1145
01:08:30,766 --> 01:08:33,632
What the fuck did they teach
you guys in grad school?

1146
01:08:33,634 --> 01:08:36,099
Jack, in her mind he is
always right behind

1147

her, watching her.

1148

When she is taking a shit.

1150
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:42,632
When she is alone with her
therapist, he is right there

1151
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:44,432
watching her, ready to pounce.

1152
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:46,899
And you just expect her to
just come out and say it?

1153
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,533
Are you guys fucking stupid?

1154
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:50,533
Because she was here asking for
help, and you just send

1155
01:08:50,533 --> 01:08:52,666
her back to the fucking shark.

1156
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:54,666
JACK (OFFSCREEN): I realize
you're upset, Grace.

1157
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:57,065
But yelling at me isn't
an effective form of

1158

1159
01:09:00,132 --> 01:09:01,600

OK, Jack.

Jack, I'm sorry.

1162
01:09:06,567 --> 01:09:09,765
Please cancel the pass until we
figure this out, because I

1163
01:09:09,766 --> 01:09:13,265
know her and I know that things
are not good at home.

1164
01:09:13,266 --> 01:09:14,666
And how do you know that?

1165

a children's story?

And last night, that girl sat
next to me and she cried, and

1169
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,932
she tried to tell me the only
way that she knew how.

1170
01:09:25,934 --> 01:09:29,099
Grace, you are a line staff.

1171
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,600
It's not your job to
interpret tears.

1172
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,265
That's what our trained
therapists are here for.

1173
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:36,032
Then your trained therapists
don't know shit.

1174
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:38,998
Did she tell you that she was
being abused by her father?

1175
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,533
She didn't have to.

1176

away from her biological

This is bullshit.

1179

these kids longer than

1180

that I wouldn't die for.

I look into those broken eyes.

I want to go out and find the
asshole who did that to them

1184

who's hurt them.

01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:35,600
So what do you want to do?

1271
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:42,198
Hmm?

1272
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:49,733
Do you want to get an abortion?

1273
01:16:49,734 --> 01:16:51,734
I already made the appointment.

1274
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:14,332
Do whatever you want, OK?

1275
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,734
Because I'm done.

1276
01:18:32,367 --> 01:18:34,132
[clattering]

1277
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:53,132

1278
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,500
ACTOR (ON TV): Kids don't
care nothing about it.

1279
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:20,099
[audience laughing]

1280
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,932
ACTRESS (ON TV): Ed, do you
want some vittles today?

1281
01:19:22,934 --> 01:19:24,533
ACTOR (ON TV): I do, Granny.

1282
01:19:24,533 --> 01:19:26,466
I worked up a right smart
appetite fetching

1283
01:19:26,466 --> 01:19:27,998
sticks for old Duke.

1284
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,800
ACTRESS (ON TV): Yes, that's
the trouble around here.

1285
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:31,699
The critters are taking over.

1286
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:35,265
Billie Mae has done made pets
out of everything but my

1287
01:19:35,266 --> 01:19:36,332
pickled turnips.

1288
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,966
What are we going to
do for vittles?

1289
01:19:37,967 --> 01:19:38,998
ACTOR (ON TV): Wait, I remember

1290
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,533
someplace to drive near...

[tv blaring]

1292
01:19:52,132 --> 01:19:54,132
JAYDEN (OFFSCREEN): What
are you doing?

1293
01:19:56,234 --> 01:19:58,466
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

1294
01:20:19,567 --> 01:20:21,867
[sigh]

1295
01:20:21,868 --> 01:20:23,900
Are you going crazy?

1296
01:20:27,766 --> 01:20:29,567
Probably.

1297
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:43,932
When I was your age, I had to
stand in a courtroom with a

1298
01:20:43,934 --> 01:20:47,699
bunch of strangers and tell
them all the ways

1299
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:49,300
that he abused me.

1300
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:54,466
What he hit me with.

1301
01:20:56,399 --> 01:20:58,000
How he got drunk.

1302
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:02,900
How he forced me to take
a shower with him.

1303
01:21:08,533 --> 01:21:10,132
Got me pregnant.

1304
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:17,266
I sent him to prison.

1305
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,565
I didn't talk about it.

1306
01:21:24,567 --> 01:21:26,367
I didn't think about it.

1307
01:21:30,466 --> 01:21:32,067
Until I met you.

1308
01:21:37,533 --> 01:21:38,934
And I don't know.

1309
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:45,765
I have a baby inside of
me, and I don't know.

1310
01:21:45,766 --> 01:21:47,634
I don't know what I'm doing.

1311
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,300
I was just trying to help you.

1312
01:22:12,701 --> 01:22:15,666
Oh my god.

1313
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:18,699
He loves the belt.

1314
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:20,600
It's such a cliche.

1315
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,500
Jayden, we have to do
something about this.

1316
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:25,800
Should go bash his face
in with a baseball

1317
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:27,399
bat while he's sleeping?

1318
01:23:05,567 --> 01:23:09,966
Uh, we should get out of here.

1319
01:23:09,967 --> 01:23:11,766
He'll sleep through anything.

1320
01:24:16,501 --> 01:24:17,899
OK.

1321
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,501
Now we should get out of here.

1322
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,867
They're going to ask you
a lot of questions.

1323
01:24:51,868 --> 01:24:55,032
It's going to be hard.

1324
01:24:55,033 --> 01:24:56,666
I'll try to leave out the part
about you breaking into

1325
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,734
that house with a baseball bat.

1326
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:03,266
Thanks.

1327
01:25:04,634 --> 01:25:06,833
You're going to be
a really good mom.

1328
01:25:14,033 --> 01:25:17,501
I told him this was going to be
the last time I came home.

1329
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:22,667
Because I'm not going to
take his shit anymore.

1330
01:25:25,533 --> 01:25:28,132
And that set him
off, of course.

1331
01:25:30,934 --> 01:25:32,533
But I didn't care.

1332
01:26:00,766 --> 01:26:02,300
I'm sorry.

1333
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:06,300
I didn't mean what
I said earlier.

1334
01:26:08,434 --> 01:26:10,734
I'm just really messed
up right now.

1335
01:26:36,033 --> 01:26:37,734
Marcus is going to get better.

1336
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:43,466
I think I am too.

1337
01:26:59,766 --> 01:27:04,765
Grace, I know talking like
this is really hard.

1338
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:09,198
But this is our fourth session
together, and I'd really like

1339
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,801
you to try, OK?

1340
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,266
I don't really know
what to say.

1341
01:27:21,766 --> 01:27:23,800
Your dad's getting out
of prison in a week.

1342
01:27:23,801 --> 01:27:26,300
Do you want to talk about that?

1343
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,434
OK.

1344
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:02,233
Are you OK?

1345
01:28:02,234 --> 01:28:03,833
Mmhmm.

1346
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,399
Watch that monitor
over my shoulder.

1347
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:14,533
I think he's... there we go.

1348
01:28:14,533 --> 01:28:16,333
There he is.

1349
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,198
Stay with it.

1350
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:22,667
Hang on a second.

1351
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,899
Hang on.

1352
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,832
That's... that's the baby's
heartbeat, man.

1353
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,434
Oh, man.

1354
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:18,932
So you need to get ready for
this because it's so fucking

1355
01:29:18,934 --> 01:29:20,265
unbelievable.

1356
01:29:20,266 --> 01:29:21,998
It's going to seem fake, but
I promise you it's not.

1357
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,365
Grace will vouch for it.

1358
01:29:23,367 --> 01:29:24,832
It depends if you
tell it right.

1359
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:26,500
There is no way not
to tell this right.

1360
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:28,365
It is a storyteller's
wet dream.

1361
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:29,298
JESSICA (OFFSCREEN): What?

1362
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,632
Get ready for this.

1363
01:29:30,634 --> 01:29:32,032
MASON (OFFSCREEN):
OK, just in time.

1364
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:32,899
I'm going to start at
the beginning, OK.

1365
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,198
OK.

1366
01:29:34,199 --> 01:29:35,365
So three years ago, right,
we have this girl

1367
01:29:35,367 --> 01:29:37,099
here named Liza Green.

1368
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:40,032
She's 17, older than everybody
else on the unit at the time.

1369
01:29:40,033 --> 01:29:42,699
And I don't mean this in a pervy
way or anything, but

1370
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:43,998
she's real pretty.

1371
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,533
She was gorgeous.

1372
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:47,699
All the guys on the unit want
her, but she won't give any of

1373
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:49,298
them the time of day because
she was busy.

1374
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,233
She was always studying.

1375
01:29:50,234 --> 01:29:51,131
She was very smart.

1376
01:29:51,132 --> 01:29:51,966
Mmhmm.

1377
01:29:51,967 --> 01:29:53,298
Really smart.

1378
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,666
So two weeks before she turns
18 and leaves, we

1379
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:56,600
get this new intake.

1380
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,500
It's a 15-year-old guy.

1381
01:29:58,501 --> 01:29:59,399
He's really tough.

1382
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:00,298
He's really quiet.

1383
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,032
But he's cool.

1384
01:30:02,033 --> 01:30:03,966
He's just kind of like kicking
back, checking out the scene.

1385
01:30:03,967 --> 01:30:07,265
And I swear I didn't hear him
say a word the whole first

1386
01:30:07,266 --> 01:30:08,998
week he was here.

1387
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,265
But then one day we were doing
community meeting, and we ask

1388
01:30:11,266 --> 01:30:12,432
for announcements.

1389
01:30:12,434 --> 01:30:14,265
And this guy raises his hand.

1390
01:30:14,266 --> 01:30:18,666
And he looks directly at Liza
Green and he says, I know you

1391
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:19,899
don't know me.

1392
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,233
I just got here.

1393
01:30:21,234 --> 01:30:23,065
But I just want to say that
I've been watching you.

1394
01:30:23,067 --> 01:30:25,198
I think you're the most
interesting thing about this

1395
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,298
place, and I'm really sad I'm
not going to get to know you

1396
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:29,466
before you leave.

1397
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:30,600
I just wanted to tell you that.

1398
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,466
What a pimp!

1399
01:30:32,466 --> 01:30:33,565
What did she say?

1400
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:34,832
Nothing.

1401
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:35,765
NATE (OFFSCREEN): Nothing?

1402
01:30:35,766 --> 01:30:37,265
It was so awkward.

1403
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:38,998
Yeah, so fuckin' awkward
I couldn't stand it.

1404
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,065
And then she left, and
never talked to him.

1405
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:43,233
The kids teased him
for like a year.

1406
01:30:43,234 --> 01:30:44,198
JESSICA (OFFSCREEN): Aw.

1407
01:30:44,199 --> 01:30:45,265
Oh, that blows.

1408
01:30:45,266 --> 01:30:46,666
No, he didn't give a shit.

1409
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,265
No, didn't even faze him.

1410
01:30:48,266 --> 01:30:51,399
It was like he knew something
everybody else didn't.

1411
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:52,699
Who is this guy?

1412
01:30:52,701 --> 01:30:53,565
That was Marcus.

1413
01:30:53,567 --> 01:30:54,600
What?

1414
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:55,533
I never heard this story.

1415
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:56,500
Oh, wait.

1416
01:30:56,501 --> 01:30:57,432
It gets so much better.

1417
01:30:57,434 --> 01:30:58,365
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

1418
01:30:58,367 --> 01:31:00,099
Yeah, so check this out.

1419
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,099
Grace and I are getting coffee
at Ronnie's this morning, and

1420
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,399
we walk in.

1421
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:04,265
And who do we see sitting
there alone at a table?

1422
01:31:04,266 --> 01:31:05,699
Marcus.

1423
01:31:05,701 --> 01:31:06,533
How's he doing?

1424
01:31:06,533 --> 01:31:07,765
Oh!

1425
01:31:07,766 --> 01:31:08,600
MASON (OFFSCREEN):
He looks great.

1426
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,500
He's so good.

1427
01:31:09,501 --> 01:31:10,600
Buttoned-up shirt.

1428
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,500
He's sippin' on a cappuccino.

1429
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:14,099
Marcus drinks cappuccino?

1430
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:14,998
Yeah.

1431
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,099
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Apparently.

1432
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,332
Yeah, I guess so.

1433
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:19,065
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): Apparently
now he does.

1434
01:31:19,067 --> 01:31:20,065
MASON (OFFSCREEN): So we're
talking to him and we're

1435
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:21,565
catching up.

1436
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,032
And he's telling us about his
new job at the aquarium and

1437
01:31:23,033 --> 01:31:24,632
how much he takes home in tips.

1438
01:31:24,634 --> 01:31:25,600
And now he's going to
start applying for

1439
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,832
classes next semester.

1440
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:27,533
JESSICA (OFFSCREEN): Oh my god!

1441
01:31:27,533 --> 01:31:29,099
Yeah.

1442
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,131
And it's weird because I'm like,
I have not heard Marcus

1443
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:33,365
talk this much ever,
since I met him.

1444
01:31:33,367 --> 01:31:35,298
Like, what is the deal?

1445
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,500
Is he excited to see us?

1446
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:38,099
Is he nervous about something?

1447
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:41,699
And that's when I notice there's
another cappuccino on

1448
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:44,298
the table and an empty
chair next to him.

1449
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:48,765
And then just like in the
fucking movies, bathroom door

1450
01:31:48,766 --> 01:31:52,800
flings open, out walks
Liza Green.

1451
01:31:52,801 --> 01:31:53,899
They were on a date?

1452
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,265
It was like their fifth one.

1453
01:31:55,266 --> 01:31:56,298
MASON (OFFSCREEN): Yes!

1454
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,032
Oh!

1455
01:31:58,033 --> 01:32:00,632
As soon... as soon as she sits
down, dude just goes beet-red.

1456
01:32:00,634 --> 01:32:01,565
He's so embarrassed.

1457
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:03,233
Oh, it was so cute.

1458
01:32:03,234 --> 01:32:05,666
Oh, it was so fucking cute,
I almost pissed my pants.

1459
01:32:05,667 --> 01:32:07,733
Oh Jess, they look
so happy together.

1460
01:32:07,734 --> 01:32:08,666
MASON (OFFSCREEN): So happy.

1461
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:09,632
And there's just...

1462
01:32:09,634 --> 01:32:10,632
[screaming]

1463
01:32:10,634 --> 01:32:11,632
[alarm blaring]

1464
01:32:11,634 --> 01:32:13,632
Here we go.

1465
01:32:13,634 --> 01:32:16,234
[music playing]

1466
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,634
[MUSIC - KEITH MILGATEN,
"AFTER PARTY"]

1467
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,113
