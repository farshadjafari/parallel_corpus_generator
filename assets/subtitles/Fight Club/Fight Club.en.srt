00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,490
[Narrator]
People are always asking me

2
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,150
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,920
[Tyler] 3 minutes.

4
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,950
[Tyler] 3 minutes.

5
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,120
This is it - ground zero.

6
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,250
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,450
[Muffled]

8
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,290
[Narrator] With a gun barrel
between your teeth,

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,460
you speak only in vowels.

10
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,800
I can't think
of anything.

11
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,460
For a second
I totally forget

12
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,060
about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

13
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,270
and I wonder
how clean that gun is.

14
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,140
[Tyler] Getting
exciting now.

15
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,200
That old saying,

16
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,470
how you always hurt
the one you love?

17
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,740
Well, it works both ways.

18
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,410
[Police Sirens]

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,950
We have front row seats

20
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,010
for this theater
of mass destruction.

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,420
The demolitions committee
of Project Mayhem

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,960
wrapped the foundation
columns of a dozen buildings

23
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,960
with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes,

24
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,960
primary charges
will blow base charges

25
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,220
and a few square blocks

26
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,030
will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.

27
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,160
I know this...

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,930
because Tyler knows this.

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,600
21/2.

30
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,610
Think of everything
we've accomplished.

31
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,640
And suddenly, I realize
that all of this

32
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,210
the gun, the bombs,
the revolution...

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,740
has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

35
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,380
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

36
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,930
The big moosey
slobbering all over me,

37
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,960
that was Bob.

38
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,190
We're still men.

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,230
Yes, we're men.

40
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,800
Men is what we are.

41
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,890
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,460
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits

43
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,540
because his testosterone
was too high,

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,410
and his body
upped the estrogen.

45
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,740
And that was where I fit...

46
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,780
They're gonna have to
open up my pecs again

47
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,840
and drain the fluid.

48
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,780
[Narrator] Between those huge,
sweating tits

49
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,220
that hung enormous the way
you'd think of God's as big.

50
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,320
OK. You cry now.

51
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,920
No, wait. Back up.
Let me start earlier.

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,030
For 6 months,
I couldn't sleep.

53
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,620
[Echo] I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.

54
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,860
With insomnia,
nothing's real.

55
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,530
Everything's far away.

56
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,410
Everything's a copy
of a copy of a copy.

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,540
When deep space
exploration ramps up,

58
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,280
it'll be the corporations
that name everything...

59
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,880
the I.B.M. Stellarsphere,

60
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,920
the Microsoft Galaxy,

61
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,510
Planet Starbucks.

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,180
Gonna need you out of town
a little more this week.

63
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,760
We got some
red flags to cover.

64
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,230
It must've been Tuesday.

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,360
He was wearing
his cornflower-blue tie.

66
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,560
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports

67
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,070
until you advise
of a status upgrade?

68
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,900
Make these your primary
action items.

69
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,060
Here's
your flight coupons.

70
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,700
Call me from the road
if there's any snags.

71
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,240
[Narrator]
He was full of pep.

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,510
Must have had
his grande latte enema.

73
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,370
Like so many others,
I had become a slave

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,750
to the <i>IKEA</i>
nesting instinct.

75
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,760
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

76
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,790
[Operator] Please hold.

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,090
If I saw something clever

78
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,160
like a little coffee table
in the shape of a yin-yang,

79
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,030
I had to have it.

80
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,960
The Klipske
personal office unit,

81
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,470
the Hovetrekke
home exer-bike,

82
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,200
or the Johannshamn sofa

83
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,540
with the Strinne green
stripe pattern.

84
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,570
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,700
of environmentally friendly
unbleached paper.

86
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,610
I'd flip through catalogs
and wonder...

87
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,710
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

88
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,180
I had it all.

89
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,380
Even the glass dishes

90
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,390
with tiny bubbles
and imperfections.

91
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,550
Proof that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

92
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,350
hard-working indigenous
peoples of...

93
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,390
[Operator] Please hold.

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,390
[Narrator] Wherever.

95
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,760
I was holding.

96
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,390
We used to read pornography.

97
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,560
Now it was
the Horchow collection.

98
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,640
No, you can't
die from insomnia.

99
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,800
What about narcolepsy?

100
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,840
I nod off. I wake up
in strange places.

101
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,400
I have no idea
how I got there.

102
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,210
You need to lighten up.

103
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,580
Can you please just
get me something?

104
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,850
[Narrator] Red and blue Tuenols,
lipstick-red Seconals.

105
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,550
No. You need
healthy natural sleep.

106
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,180
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

107
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,330
Hey, come on.
I'm in pain.

108
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,200
You wanna see pain?

109
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,000
Swing by First Methodist
Tuesday nights.

110
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,160
See the guys
with testicular cancer.

111
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,870
That's pain.

112
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,440
[Chorus]  La la la 

113
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,850
 La la la la la la 

114
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,650
I always wanted 3 kids,

115
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,690
2 boys and a girl.

116
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,660
Mindy wanted
2 girls and a boy.

117
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,670
We never could
agree on anything.

118
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,700
Well, uh,
you know, she...

119
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,260
She had her first child
last week, a...

120
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,100
a girl.

121
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,730
With... With her, uh,
with her new husband.

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,210
[Man] [Whispering] Fuck.

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,310
Hey... Hey, thank God,
you know.

124
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm... I'm glad for her.

125
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,220
Because she deserves it.

126
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,850
[Group Leader] Aw.

127
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,450
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

128
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,860
[All] Thank you, Thomas.

129
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,200
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage,

130
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,330
and that gives me strength.

131
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,840
We give each other strength.

132
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,840
It's time
for the one-on-ones.

133
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,670
So let's all of us here
follow Thomas' good example

134
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,210
and really open ourselves up.

135
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,510
Would you find a partner?

136
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,050
[Narrator] And this is how
I met the big moosey...

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,210
[Man] Come on.
Let's go over here.

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,520
His eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears...

139
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,230
knees together,
those awkward little steps.

140
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,200
My name is Bob.

141
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,770
Bob.

142
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,310
[Narrator] Bob had been
a champion body-builder.

143
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,340
You know that
chest-expansion program

144
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,470
you see on late-night TV?
That was his idea.

145
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,310
I was a juicer.

146
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,010
You know,
using steroids.

147
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,820
Diabonal and...

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
Wistrol.
Oh, they use that

149
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,690
on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,490
And now I'm bankrupt.

151
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,690
I'm divorced.

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,240
My 2 grown kids...

153
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,070
won't even return
my phone calls.

154
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,840
[Narrator] Strangers
with this kind of honesty

155
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,410
make me go
a big rubbery one.

156
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,220
Go ahead, Cornelius.

157
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,480
You can cry.

158
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,460
[Crying]

159
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,030
[Narrator] And then,
something happened.

160
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,500
I let go.

161
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,060
That's really good.

162
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,110
Lost in oblivion...

163
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,300
dark and silent
and complete.

164
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,840
I found freedom.

165
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,650
Losing all hope was freedom.

166
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,690
It's OK.

167
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,190
Babies don't sleep
this well.

168
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,520
[Snores]

169
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,330
I became addicted.

170
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,880
Come on.

171
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,310
[Narrator]
If I didn't say anything...

172
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,180
people always
assumed the worst.

173
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,220
[Man] Welcome, Travis.

174
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,190
Second [Man] Welcome, Travis.

175
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,050
They cried harder...

176
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,320
then I cried harder.

177
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,320
[Group Murmurs]

178
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,670
[Woman] Now we're going
to open the green door,

179
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,330
the heart chakra.

180
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,670
[Narrator]

00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,740
What, are you selling those?

363
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:56,770
What, are you selling those?

364
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,600
Yes! I'm selling
some clothes.

365
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,730
So,

366
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,140
we each have 3.
That's 6.

367
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,440
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.

368
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,940
[Narrator] The girl
had done her homework.

369
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,940
Thank you.

370
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,940
No. No, I...

371
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,210
I want bowel cancer.

372
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,040
That's your favorite, too?

373
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,350
Try to slip it by me, eh?

374
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,890
Look, we're gonna
split it, OK?

375
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,720
Take the first and third
Sunday of the month.

376
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,060
Deal.

377
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,560
Looks like
this is good-bye.

378
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,760
Well, let's not make a
big thing out of it, OK?

379
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,700
How's this for not
making a big thing?

380
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,200
[Door Opens]

381
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,570
Hey, Marla!

382
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,570
[Horn Honks]

383
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,570
Marla!

384
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,200
May-Maybe we should
exchange numbers.

385
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,750
Should we?

386
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,780
W-We might want
to switch nights.

387
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,340
OK.

388
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,850
[Narrator] This is how I met
Marla Singer.

389
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,860
[Humming]

390
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,190
Marla's philosophy of life

391
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,360
was that she might die
at any moment.

392
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,130
The tragedy, she said,
was that she didn't.

393
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,360
It doesn't have
your name.

394
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,460
Who are you,

395
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,600
Cornelius,
Rupert,

396
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,000
Travis,

397
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
any of the
stupid names

398
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,500
you give each
night?

399
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,580
You wake up
at Seatac.

400
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,840
S.F.O...

401
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,940
L.A.X...

402
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,850
You wake up at O'Hare...

403
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,410
Dallas-Fort Worth...

404
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,460
B.W.I...

405
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,760
Pacific, mountain,
central...

406
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,390
Lose an hour,
gain an hour...

407
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,990
Check-in for that
flight doesn't begin

408
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,550
for another 2 hours,
sir.

409
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,660
This is your life, and it's
ending one minute at a time.

410
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,140
You wake up at Air Harbor
International...

411
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,140
[P.A.] the aircraft has
come to a complete stop.

412
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,870
If you wake up
at a different time,

413
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,910
in a different place,

414
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,070
could you wake up
as a different person?

415
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,250
Everywhere I travel,

416
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,780
tiny life...

417
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,680
single-serving sugar...

418
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,880
single-serving cream...

419
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,790
single pat of butter...

420
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,690
a microwave cordon-bleu
hobby kit.

421
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,730
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

422
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,030
Sample package mouthwash,
tiny bars of soap.

423
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,660
The people I meet
on each flight,

424
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,800
they're single-serving
friends.

425
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,670
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together,

426
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,010
but that's all we get.

427
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,940
[Together] Welcome!

428
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,140
[Narrator] On
a long enough timeline,

429
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,740
the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

430
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,880
I was a recall coordinator.

431
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,010
My job was
to apply the formula.

432
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,020
Here's where
the infant

433
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,350
went through
the windshield.

434
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,450
3 points.

435
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,860
[Narrator] A new car
built by my company

436
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,260
leaves somewhere traveling
at 60 miles per hour.

437
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,860
The rear differential
locks up.

438
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,920
The teenager's braces

439
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,530
are wrapped around
the back seat ashtray.

440
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,870
Might make
a good antismoking ad.

441
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,340
[Narrator]
The car crashes and burns

442
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,030
with everyone
trapped inside.

443
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,600
Now, should we
initiate a recall?

444
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,870
The father
must've been huge.

445
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,110
You see
where the fat

446
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,310
has burned
to the seat,

447
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,910
the polyester shirt?

448
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,040
- Very modern art.
- Ha ha ha!

449
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,090
[Narrator] Take the number of
vehicles in the field, "A,"

450
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,780
multiply it by the probable
rate of failure, "B,"

451
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,880
then multiply the result

452
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,220
by the average out-of-court
settlement, "C."

453
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,060
"A" times "B" times "C"

454
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,600
equals "X."

455
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,600
If "X" is less
than the cost of a recall,

456
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,860
we don't do one.

457
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,170
Are there a lot

458
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,140
of these kinds
of accidents?

459
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,070
You wouldn't believe.

460
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,110
Which car company
do you work for?

461
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,840
A major one.

462
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,810
[Narrator] Every time the plane
banked too sharply

463
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,720
on takeoff or landing,

464
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,650
I prayed for a crash

465
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,190
or a midair collision.

466
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,230
Anything.

467
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,630
[Screaming]

468
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,930
Life insurance
pays off triple

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,490
if you die
on a business trip.

470
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,600
[Ding]

471
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,340
"If you are seated in an
emergency exit row..."

472
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,640
Yeah...

473
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,270
"And you feel
you would be unable

474
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,780
or unwilling to
perform the duties

475
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,580
listed on
the safety card,

476
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,210
please ask
a flight attendant

477
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,220
to reseat you."

478
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,150
It's a lot
of responsibility.

479
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,420
Wanna switch seats?

480
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,090
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man

481
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,990
for that particular job.

482
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,960
An exit-door procedure
at 30,000 feet.

483
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,590
Mm-hmm.

484
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,600
The illusion of safety.

485
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,370
Yeah. I guess so.

486
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,960
You know why they put
oxygen masks on planes?

487
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,770
So you can breathe.

488
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,710
Oxygen gets you high.

489
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,180
In a catastrophic
emergency,

490
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,240
you're taking giant
panicked breaths.

491
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,910
Suddenly you become
euphoric, docile.

492
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,180
You accept your fate.

493
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,880
It's all right here.

494
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,690
Emergency
water landing...

495
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,190
600 miles an hour.

496
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,290
Blank faces,

497
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,060
calm as Hindu cows.

498
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,160
That's, um...

499
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,230
That's an interesting
theory.

500
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,200
What do you do?

501
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,710
What do you mean?

502
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,040
What do you do
for a living?

503
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,200
Why? So you can pretend
like you're interested?

504
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,840
[Laughs]

505
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,110
OK.

506
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,020
You have a kind of
sick desperation

507
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,280
in your laugh.

508
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,650
We have
the exact same briefcase.

509
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,520
Soap.

510
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,530
Sorry?

511
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,330
I make
and I sell soap...

512
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,230
the yardstick
of civilization.

513
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,070
[Narrator] And this is
how I met...

514
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,830
"Tyler Durden."

515
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,740
Did you know, if you
mixed equal parts

516
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,710
of gasoline and frozen
orange juice concentrate,

517
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,540
you can make napalm?

518
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,440
No, I did not know that.
Is that true?

519
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,610
That's right.

520
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,240
One can make all kinds
of explosives

521
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,150
using simple
household items.

522
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,280
Really?

523
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,010
If one were
so inclined.

524
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,420
Tyler, you are, by far,
the most interesting

525
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,060
"single-serving" friend
I've ever met.

526
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,930
See, obviously,

527
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,870
everything on a plane
is single-serving, even...

528
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,130
Oh, I get it.
It's very clever.

529
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,760
Thank you.

530
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,570
How's that working out
for you?

531
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,570
What?

532
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,800
Being clever.

533
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,240
Great.

534
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,250
Keep it up, then.

535
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,250
Right up.

536
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,580
Now a question
of etiquette.

537
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,780
As I pass,

538
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,250
do I give you the ass
or the crotch?

539
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,590
[Narrator] How I came
to live with Tyler is...

540
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,690
airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

541
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,880
Was... Was it ticking?

542
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,280
Actually, throwers don't
worry about ticking,

543

that when I came home
angry or depressed,

909
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,940
I'd just clean my condo,

Absolutely.

922
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,470
Efficiency is priority
number one, people,

923
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,340
because waste
is a thief.

924
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,110

to my man, here.

Gentlemen, welcome
to Fight Club.

939
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,100
The first rule
of Fight Club is...

The second rule

Third rule of Fight Club...

Sometimes,
all you could hear

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,490
were the flat, hard
packing sounds

966
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,660
over the yelling...

967
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,110

someone caught their breath

968
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,110
and sprayed...

when Fight Club starts

and when Fight Club ends.

Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

I wouldn't be talking
to the same man.

Who you were
in Fight Club

977
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,920
is not who you were
in the rest of the world.

he was carved
out of wood.

who would you fight?

Alive or dead?

It doesn't matter.
Who'd be tough?

Fight Club wasn't about
winning or losing.

1005
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,880
It wasn't about words.

1006
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,190
The hysterical shouting
was in tongues,

1007
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,390
like in
a Pentecostal church.

- Stop!

was over,

days before
the actual explosion.

1259
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,190
The gas was
just the detonator.

1260
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,660
Who would go and do
such a thing?

1261
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,960
I'll ask the questions.

[Detective] Excuse me.
Are you there?

1265
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,870
No, I am listening.
It's a little hard to know

1266

what to make
of all this.

1267
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,440
Have you recently made
enemies with anyone

to homemade dynamite?

1269

- Enemies?
- Reject the basic

of material possessions.

it's serious.

Yes,
it's very serious.

Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

1277

OK? I loved every stick
of furniture in that place.

a bunch of stuff

Tell him you
blew it all up.

That's what
he wants to hear.

Wait. Are you saying
that I'm a suspect?

No, no. I may need to talk
to you a little further,

My parents pulled this
exact same act for years.

1297
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:02,570
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

1298
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,570
You slip one on
when you meet a stranger.

You... dance
all night.

1300

Then you
throw it away.

1301

Not the stranger.

[Chuckles]

1304
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,250
I got this dress
at a thrift store for $1.00.

1305
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,260
It was worth
every penny.

1306
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,230
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

1307
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,760
Someone loved it...
intensely

1308
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,270
for one day...

1309
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,830
then tossed it.

1310
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,100
Like a Christmas tree...

Well, then it suits you.

I'll say this
about Marla...

at least she's tryin'

- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1346
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,670
We make soap.

1347
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,860
Really.

1348
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,000
To make soap,
first we render fat.

1349
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,390
The salt balance
has to be just right,

1350
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,190
so the best fat for making
soap comes from humans.

1351
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,490
Wait.
What is this place?

1352
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,060
A liposuction clinic.

1353
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,430
Aha! Pay dirt.

1354
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,670
The richest, creamiest fat
in the world.

1355
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,180
Fat of the land.

Get another one.
Unhh!

1359
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,030
As the fat renders, the tallows
float to the surface.

1360
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,870
Like in Boy Scouts.

1361
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,310
I can imagine you

Keep stirrin'.

1363
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,650
Once the tallow hardens,

1364
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,950
we skim off
a layer of glycerin.

1365
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,320
If you were to add nitric
acid, you got nitroglycerin.

1366
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:40,650
If you were then to add
sodium nitrate

1367
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,350
and a dash of sawdust,
you got dynamite.

1368
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,220
Yeah, with enough soap,

1369
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,590
we could blow up
just about anything.

[Narrator] Tyler was full
of useful information.

1371
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,100
Now, ancient peoples found
that clothes got cleaner

1372
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,970
when they washed them at a
certain point in the river.

- You know why?
- No.

1374
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,800
Human sacrifices

1375

on the hills
above this river.

1376
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,470
Bodies burned. Water seeped
into the wood and ashes

1377
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,210
to create lye.

1378
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,580
This is lye,
the crucial ingredient.

1379
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,380
Once it mixed with the
melted fat of bodies,

1380
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:11,940
a thick, white,
soapy discharge

1381
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,390

Uh... Aah! Aah!

1386
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,330
It'll hurt more than
you've ever been burned,

1387

a scar.

Look at your hand.

01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,130
Please. Please tell me
that's not a gun.

1786
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,130
It's a gun.

1787
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,130
What are you doing?

1788
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,130
Meet me in the back.

1789
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,670
Hey, don't fuck around.

1790
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,930
Meet me in the back.

1791
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,130
[Narrator] On a long enough
time line,

1792
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:51,610
the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

1793
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:54,700
What are you doing?
Come on.

1794
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,110
Hands behind your back.

1795
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:57,110
God.

1796
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,270
Give me your wallet.

1797
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,880
Raymond K. Hessel,

1798
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:03,940
1320 Southeast Banning,
apartment A.

1799
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,350
Small, cramped basement
apartment, Raymond?

1800
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,450
How did you know?

1801
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,150
Because they give
shitty basement apartments

1802
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,160
letters instead of numbers.

1803
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,690
Raymond...

1804
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:13,160
you're going to die.

1805
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:14,700
[Crying]
Oh, my God, no...

1806
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,960
Is that your mom and dad?

1807
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,520
Mom and dad are going
to have to call up

1808
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:18,600
kindly Dr. So-And-So

1809
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,070
to pick up
your dental records.

1810
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,330
You want to know why?

1811
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,130
Because there's going to be
nothing left of your face.

1812
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,970
- Aw, come on.
- [Crying]

1813
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,480
An expired community college
student I.D.

1814
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,980
What'd you study, Raymond?

1815
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:30,600
S-S-S-Stuff.

1816
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,080
Stuff?

1817
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,280
Were the midterms hard?

1818
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,320
[Whimpering]

1819
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:36,750
I asked you
what you studied.

1820
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:37,950
Biology, mostly.

1821
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,150
Why?

1822
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,120
I... I don't know.

1823
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:44,590
What did you want to be,
Raymond K. Hessel?

1824
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:45,990
[Click]

1825
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,190
The question, Raymond,

1826
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,700
was what did you
want to be?

1827
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:51,740
was what did you
want to be?

1828
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,630
Answer him,
Raymond! Jesus!

1829
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,100
Veterinarian!
Veterinarian!

1830
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,230
Animals.

1831
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,240
Yeah, animal s-s-s...

1832
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:59,330
Stuff.
Yeah, I got that.

1833
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,470
That means you have to
get more schooling.

1834
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,980
Too much school.

1835
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,410
Would you rather be dead?

1836
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,410
No...

1837
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,710
Would you
rather die, here,

1838
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,220
on your knees,

1839
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,080
in the back
of a convenience store?

1840
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,710
[Whimpering]
No... No, please...

1841
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,050
no...

1842
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,820
[Releases Hammer]

1843
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,880
I'm keeping your license.

1844
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,720
Gonna check in on you.

1845
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,730
I know where you live.

1846
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,770
If you're not on your way
to becoming a veterinarian

1847
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:26,460
in 6 weeks,
you will be dead.

1848
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,270
[Whimpering]

1849
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,170
Now run on home.

1850
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:37,240
Run, Forrest, run!

1851
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,250
I feel ill.

1852
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:43,520
Imagine how he feels.

1853
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:45,520
Come on,
this isn't funny!

1854
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:47,020
That wasn't funny.

1855
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,120
What the fuck
was the point of that?

1856
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,630
Tomorrow will be
the most beautiful day

1857
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:52,130
of Raymond K. Hessel's life.

1858
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,630
His breakfast
will taste better

1859
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,600
than any meal you and I
have ever tasted.

1860
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:00,690
[Narrator] You had to
give it to him.

1861
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,130
Come on.

1862
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:03,170
He had a plan.

1863
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,170
And it started
to make sense

1864
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,610
in a Tyler sort of way.

1865
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,640
No fear.

1866
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,680
No distractions.

1867
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:13,110
The ability to let
that which does not matter

1868
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,150
truly slide.

1869
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,920
You're not your job.

1870
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:34,430
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1871
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,940
You're not
the car you drive.

1872
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,600
You're not the contents
of your wallet.

1873
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,100
You're not
your fuckin' khakis.

1874
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,720
You're the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1875
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,730
I'll be out of your way
in a sec.

1876
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,260
You don't have to go.

1877
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,460
Whatever.

1878
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:11,470
No, I mean, uh...

1879
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,740
It's OK.

1880
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:25,090
Are you still going
to groups?

1881
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:26,250
Yeah.

1882
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,260
Chloe's dead.

1883
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:33,020
Ah, Chloe.

1884
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,260
When did that happen?

1885
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:37,730
Do you care?

1886
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,100
I don't know.

1887
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:41,360
I haven't thought
about it in a while.

1888
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,700
Yeah, well...

1889
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:46,900
I think it was
a smart move on her part.

1890
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,380
Hey, listen, uh...

1891
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:53,110
what are you getting
out of all this?

1892
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,340
What?

1893
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:57,020
I mean, all this.

1894
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:58,520
Why do you keep...

1895
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:01,060
Is this
making you happy?

1896
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:04,720
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1897
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,630
I don't know.
I don't understand.

1898
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,630
Why does
a weaker person

1899
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,130
need to latch on to
a strong person?

1900
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,460
What is that?

1901
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,660
Well, what do you
get out of it?

1902
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,540
No... It's... It's not
the same thing at all.

1903
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,480
I mean, we're... It's
totally different with us.

1904
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,640
We're... We're...

1905
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:24,740
Us?

1906
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,650
What do you mean by "us"?

1907
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,450
I'm sorry,
do you hear this?

1908
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,540
Hear what?

1909
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:31,590
You're not hearing
all that noise?

1910
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:32,590
Just... Hold on a second.

1911
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,780
No, wait.
What were you saying?

1912
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,550
Don't change the subject.
I want to talk about this.

1913
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,320
You're not talking
about me, are you?

1914
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:39,220
No. What?

1915
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,090
That day you came over
to my place to play doctor...

1916
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,720
what was going on there?

1917
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,770
What <i>are</i> you
talking about?

1918
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:45,300
Nothing. Nothing.

1919
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,430
I don't think so.

1920
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,730
Come on,
what do you want?

1921
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,100
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1922
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,930
Look at me.

1923
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:52,440
What is that?

1924
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,100
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1925
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,110
Oh, my God.

1926
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,200
Who did this?

1927
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,210
A person.

1928
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,270
Guy or girl?

1929
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:00,340
What do you care
if it's a guy or a girl?

1930
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:01,470
What do you care
if I ask?

1931
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,710
This is none of your
business. Leave me alone.

1932
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,720
You're afraid to say it.

1933
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,720
I am not afraid to say.
Let me go.

1934
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,810
No! Talk to me.

1935
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:07,120
- No!
- Let go of me. Leave me alone.

1936
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,680
This conversation...

1937
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,850
This conversation...

1938
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,720
is over.

1939
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,260
is over.

1940
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:16,760
I just can't win
with you, can I?

1941
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:27,540
Hey, this is getting
a little old.

1942
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:29,080
[Doorbell]

1943
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,340
What is... What is all this?

1944
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,810
What do you think?

1945
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,340
Hey, why do we need
bunk beds?

1946
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,350
Hey.

1947
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,020
Too young.

1948
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,650
Sorry.

1949
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,930
What's all that?

1950
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,560
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1951
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,100
Old, too old.
Fat, too fat.

1952
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,140
Applicant?

1953
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:58,070
If the applicant
then waits for 3 days

1954
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,070
without food, shelter
or encouragement,

1955
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:02,580
he may then enter
and begin his training.

1956
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:04,200
Training for what?

1957
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,290
You think
this is a game?

1958
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:13,290
You're too young
to train here.

1959
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,290
End of story.
Quit wasting our time.

1960
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,760
Get the fuck
out of here.

1961
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,760
Bad news, friend.

1962
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,870
It's not gonna happen.

1963

I'm sorry if there was
a misunderstanding.

1964

It's not the end
of the world.

You're trespassing,

1968
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,080

call the police.

1969
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,350
Don't you look at me.

1970
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,180
Do you think you're
ever getting in this house?

1971
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,690
You're never getting in
this fucking house.

1972
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,590
Never. Now get the fuck
off the porch.

01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,630
I'm gonna go inside and
I'm gonna get a shovel.

You're too old,

01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,430
Your tits

1993

You are not special.

You are not
a beautiful or unique snowflake.

You are the same

We are all part of
the same compost heap.

01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:58,350
[Narrator] Why was Tyler Durden
building an army?

2015
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:00,050
To what purpose?

2016
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:01,880
For what greater good?

2017
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:07,160
In Tyler we trusted.

2018
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:16,770
No, when he was like, "You are
not your job," I was like...

what you think
has happened here?

2034
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,380
We believe
this is one of many

recent acts of vandalism
around the city

2036
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:05,650
somehow related to

We'll be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.

That was Police Commissioner

01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,370
It will take dedication
and commitment,

2060

and most of all,
cooperation.

2061

The streets are safer now.

01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:25,230
Hey, Tyler!

2142
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:26,670
[Horn Honking]

2143
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:29,730
Goddamn it, Tyler!

2144
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:31,470
What do you want?!
Statement of purpose?

2145
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:32,600
Should I e-mail you?

2146
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:34,160
Should I put this
on your action item list?

2147
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,730
You decide your own
level of involvement!

2148
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:38,510
I will! I want to know
certain things first.

2149
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:40,210
The first rule
of Project Mayhem...

2150
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,210
Shut up!

2151
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,410
I want to know
what you're thinking.

2152
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:44,450
Fuck what you know.

2153
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,750
You need to forget
about what you know.

2154
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:46,750
That's your problem.

2155
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,080
Forget about what
you think you know

2156
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,950
about life,
about friendship,

2157
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:52,390
and especially
about you and me.

2158
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,430
What?

2159
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,760
What is that supposed
to mean? What...

2160
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,030
What are you doing?

2161
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,930
Guys, what do you wish
you'd done before you die?

2162
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:06,030
Paint a self-portrait.

2163
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,040
Build a house.

2164
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:08,580
And you?

2165
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,200
I don't know.
Get in the right lane.

2166
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,870
I have to know the answer
to this question.

2167
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:14,010
If you were to die
right now,

2168
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,020
how would you feel
about your life?

2169
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,110
I don't know!

2170
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:18,380
I wouldn't feel anything
good about my life.

2171
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:19,750
Is that what you want
to hear me say? Fine.

2172
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:21,410
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

2173
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:23,290
- [Honking]
- Stop fucking around!

2174
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,660
Tyler!

2175
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:26,720
[Honking]

2176
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,850
Jesus Christ!

2177
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:30,060
Goddamn it!

2178
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:31,690
Goddamn it!
Fuck you!

2179
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,130
Fuck Fight Club.

2180
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,860
Fuck Marla.
I'm sick of all your shit.

2181
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,910
OK.

2182
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:39,670
OK.

2183
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:41,270
Quit screwing around.
Take the wheel.

2184
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,280
Look at you.

2185
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:43,280
Take the wheel!

2186
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:45,110
Look at you!
You're fuckin' pathetic!

2187
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:46,740
Why? Why?
What are you talking about?

2188
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:50,270
Why do you think
I blew up your condo?

2189
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:52,480
What?

2190
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:54,580
Hitting bottom
isn't a weekend retreat.

2191
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:56,490
It's not
a goddamn seminar.

2192
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,490
Stop trying
to control everything

2193
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,150
and just let go.

2194
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,930
Let go!

2195
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,730
All right. Fine.

2196
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:08,840
Fine.

2197
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:10,060
[Narrator] I'd never been
in a car accident.

2198
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:13,070
This must have been what
all those people felt like

2199
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:17,070
before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.

2200
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,440
Goddamn.

2201
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:19,940
Huh?

2202
01:41:20,010 --> 01:41:22,000
Ha ha ha ha ha hahh!

2203
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,770
We just had
a near-life experience.

2204
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:32,520
In the world I see,

2205
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:35,350
you're stalking elk through
the damp canyon forest,

2206
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:37,950
around the ruins
of Rockefeller Center.

2207
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,030
You'll wear leather clothes

2208
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:45,030
that will last you
the rest of your life.

2209
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,540
You'll climb the vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

2210
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:51,940
And when you look down,

2211
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:54,940
you'll see tiny figures
pounding corn,

2212
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:58,450
laying strips of venison
on the empty carpool lane

2213
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:00,450
of some abandoned
superhighway.

2214
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,830
Feel better, champ.

2215
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,690
[Door Closes]

2216
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:35,010
[Narrator] And then...

2217
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,520
Tyler?

2218
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:38,110
Tyler was gone.

2219
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:48,160
Was I asleep?

2220
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,130
Had I slept?

2221
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,630
You are not
a beautiful

2222
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,130
unique snowflake,
do you understand me?

2223
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:57,140
[Narrator] The house had become
a living thing,

2224
01:42:57,210 --> 01:42:59,640
wet inside
from so many people

2225
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:01,040
sweating and breathing.

2226
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:03,040
We are all from
the same compost.

2227
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,310
So many people moving,
the house moved.

2228
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:09,050
Planet Tyler.

2229
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,050
I had to hug the walls.

2230
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:14,680
Trapped inside this
clockwork of space monkeys.

2231
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,190
You can't be
smoking in here.

2232
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:18,990
Do you know how much ether
we have in this fucking house?

2233
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,390
Cooking, working,
and sleeping in teams.

2234
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:25,690
Hang on a second.

2235
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:47,280
It's under control, sir.

2236
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,660
Where is Tyler?

2237
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:54,690
Sir, the first rule of
Project Mayhem is you do not...

2238
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,700
Right, uh... OK.

2239
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:01,530
I'm all alone.

2240
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,540
My father dumped me.

2241
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:05,040
Tyler dumped me.

2242
01:44:05,110 --> 01:44:08,300
I am Jack's broken heart.

2243
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:14,510
What comes next
in Project Mayhem,

2244
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:16,050
only Tyler knows.

2245
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,580
The second rule is
you do not ask questions.

2246
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:23,490
Get the fuck
away from me.

2247
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,050
Get the fuck
away from me!

2248
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:27,530
Who are all these people?

2249
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:34,890
Paper Street Soap Company.

2250
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,230
Can I come in?

2251
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,900
He's not here.

2252
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:46,170
What?

2253
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:50,820
Tyler isn't here.

2254
01:44:50,890 --> 01:44:53,380
Tyler went away.

2255
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:54,720
Tyler's gone.

2256
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:14,240
[Shouting]

2257
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:26,510
Lay him down!

2258
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:27,890
Gunshot wounds
comin' through!

2259
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,390
Clear some fucking room!

2260
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:32,760
What happened?!
What happened?!

2261
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,390
We were on assignment.
We were supposed to kill

2262
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,930
2 birds with one stone.

2263
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,090
Destroy a piece
of corporate art...

2264
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,690
Operation Latte Thunder,
go.

2265
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,540
and trash a franchise
coffee bar.

2266
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:53,310
We had it all
worked out, sir.

2267
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,490
It went smooth
until...

2268
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:05,790
Police! Freeze!

2269
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,450
Until what?

2270
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,550
They shot Bob.

2271
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:11,460
They shot him
in the head.

2272
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:12,500
Those fuckin' pigs!

2273
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,940
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

2274
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:18,970
- Oh, God.
- Son of a...

2275
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:22,170
Those motherfuckers!

2276
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,010
You morons.

2277
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:26,380
You're running around
in ski masks,

2278
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:27,540
trying
to blow things up.

2279
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:28,840
What did you think
was gonna happen?!

2280
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:33,920
OK, quick,

2281
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:35,390
we gotta get rid
of the evidence.

2282
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:36,390
We gotta get rid
of this body!

2283
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,430
Bury him.

2284
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:38,920
What?

2285
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:39,930
Take him
to the garden

2286
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:41,120
and bury him.

2287
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,200
Come on,
people!

2288
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:44,200
Let's go!

2289
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:45,390
Hey, get
the fuck off!

2290
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,430
Get away from him!

2291
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,990
What are you
talking about?

2292
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:49,470
This isn't a fucking
piece of evidence,

2293
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,770
this is a person!

2294
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:51,770
He's a friend
of mine,

2295
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,900
and you're not
gonna bury him

2296
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:53,970
in the fucking garden.

2297
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,040
He was killed serving
Project Mayhem, sir.

2298
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,270
This is Bob.

2299
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,780
But sir, in... in
Project Mayhem

2300
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:02,410
we have no names.

2301
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,480
No, you
listen to me.

2302
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,420
This is a man,
and he has a name.

2303
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:08,050
And it's
Robert Paulson, OK?

2304
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:09,550
Robert
Paulson?

2305
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:11,180
He's a man
and he's dead now

2306
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:12,280
because of us,
all right?

2307
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:13,550
Do you understand that?

2308
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,860
I understand.

2309
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:19,730
In death,

2310
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,600
a member of
Project Mayhem

2311
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:23,260
has a name.

2312
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,700
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2313
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,640
His name is

2314
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:33,740
His name is

2316
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,320
Come on, guys,
please, stop it.

2317
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:39,820
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2318
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:42,520
[Chanting] His name
is Robert Paulson.

2319
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:44,620

01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:17,210
No, you have
a house.

2498
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:18,480
Rented in your name.

2499
01:54:18,590 --> 01:54:20,490
You have jobs, you
have a whole life.

2500
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:22,150
You have night jobs
because you can't sleep.

2501
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:24,050
Or you stay up
and make soap.

2502
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:25,680
Marla... You're
fucking Marla, Tyler.

2503
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:27,690
Uh, technically,
you're fucking Marla.

2504
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,060
But it's
all the same to her.

2505
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:32,890
Oh, my God.

2506
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:35,960
Now you see
our dilemma.

2507
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,060
She knows too much.

2508
01:54:39,210 --> 01:54:40,260
I think we're going
to have to talk

2509
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:43,570
about how this might
compromise our goals.

2510
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:46,670
Wh... What are
you saying?

2511
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:48,380
This is...
This is bullshit.

2512
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:49,940
This is bullshit.

2513
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:50,980
I'm not listening
to this.

2514
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:51,980
You are insane.

2515
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:53,880
No, you're insane.

2516
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:56,480
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2517
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:00,930
It's called
a changeover.

2518
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,520
The movie goes on,

2519
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:04,030
and nobody
in the audience

2520
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:05,690
has any idea.

2521
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:19,610
[Woman] Sir!

2522
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,980
Are you checking out?

2523
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:22,240
Yeah, uh,
b-bill me.

2524
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,980
I need you to
initial this list

2525
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:25,140
of phone calls,
please.

2526
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:30,320
When were
these made?

2527
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:31,620
It says
right there, sir,

2528
01:55:31,690 --> 01:55:33,220
between 2:00 and 3:30
this morning.

2529
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:34,660
No, I w...

2530
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:39,620
Have I been
going to bed

2531
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:40,930
earlier
every night?

2532
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,030
Have I been
sleeping later?

2533
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:48,030
Have I been Tyler
longer and longer?

2534
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:52,510
Is anybody here?

2535
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:58,420
Dj vu
all over again.

2536
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:00,420
Yeah, with
enough soap,

2537
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:01,890
we could blow up
just about anything.

2538
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:07,080
Oh, my God.

2539
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:11,160
[Man On Telephone]
1888.

2540
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:12,490
I'm sorry,
who am I calling?

2541
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:14,530
1888 Franklin.
This is Maintenance.

2542
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:18,070
Hello?

2543
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:19,070
Hello?

2544
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:21,010
1888 Franklin Street?

2545
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,170
Yes.
Can I help you?

2546
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,110
Hello?

2547
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:29,310
Yeah, yeah.

2548
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:30,680
Uh, I need to talk
to your supervisor

2549
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,690
right away.

2550
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:32,690
Speaking.

2551
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,690
OK, listen to me.

2552
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:34,920
I think something
really terrible

2553
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:35,960
is about to happen
at your building.

2554
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:37,010
You have got...

2555
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:38,320
It's under
control, sir.

2556
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:40,680
Excuse me?

2557
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:42,290
Don't worry
about us, sir.

2558
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:43,800
We're solid.

2559
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,730
[Man On Telephone]
2160.

2560
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:57,670
Marla!
Marla!

2561
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:59,770
Hey... Fuck! Wait!

2562
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:02,540
Wait, I gotta
talk to you!

2563
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:03,780
Marla, Marla!

2564
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:04,940
Your whacked-out
bald freaks

2565
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,490
hit me with
a fucking broom!

2566
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:08,220
They almost
broke my arm!

2567
01:57:08,290 --> 01:57:09,920
They were burning their
fingertips with lye,

2568
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,980
the stink was
unbelievable.

2569
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:11,990
Look... Look,
listen,

2570
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:12,990
it's gonna take
a tremendous act

2571
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:13,990
of faith
on your part,

2572
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:15,030
but you've got
to hear me out.

2573
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:17,000
Oh, here comes
an avalanche of bullshit.

2574
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:18,530
A little more faith
than that.

2575
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:23,840
No, listen,
I don't want to hear

2576
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:24,840
anything
you have to say.

2577
01:57:24,910 --> 01:57:26,960
You have every
right to be...

2578
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,100
Um, I'll just have
a coffee, thanks.

2579
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:32,110
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2580
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,240
Why is it
free of charge?

2581
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,410
Don't... Don't ask.

2582
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:36,540
Whatever.

2583
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:39,250
I'll have the clam chowder,
the fried chicken

2584
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,410
with the baked potato
with everything,

2585
01:57:40,490 --> 01:57:41,960
and a chocolate
chiffon pie.

2586
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:44,120
Clean food, please.

2587
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:45,950
In that case, sir,
may I advise against

2588
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:47,250
the lady eating
the clam chowder?

2589
01:57:47,330 --> 01:57:49,320
No clam chowder,
thank you.

2590
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:53,060
You've got
about 30 seconds.

2591
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:56,700
Marla, I know that
I've been acting

2592
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,000
very, very strange.

2593
01:57:58,070 --> 01:58:00,230
OK, I know that
it's got to seem

2594
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:01,370
like there's
2 sides to me...

2595
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,370
2 sides?

2596
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:03,710
You're Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Jackass.

2597
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:04,710
I deserve that,
but...

2598
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:05,970
I've come
to realize something

2599
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:06,980
very, very
important.

2600
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:08,110
What?

2601
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:09,620
The full extent
of our relationship

2602
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,710
wasn't really clear
to me up until now,

2603
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,010
for reasons I'm not
going to go into,

2604
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:14,520
but the important
thing is, I know

2605
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:15,780
that I haven't been
treating you so nice.

2606
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:16,790
Yeah, whatever.

2607
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,820
No, no...
15 seconds.

2608
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:19,090
15 seconds,
please, please.

2609
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,990
15 seconds, don't
open your mouth.

2610
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:23,620
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm sorry.

2611
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:24,890
Because what
I've come to realize

2612
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:27,700
is that I really
like you, Marla.

2613
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,230
You do?

2614
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:31,830
I really do.

2615
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:32,870
I care about you

2616
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,960
and I don't want
anything bad

2617
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:36,600
to happen to you
because of me.

2618
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:39,370
Marla, your life
is in danger.

2619
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:41,450
What?

2620
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,920
You need to leave
town for a while.

2621
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:45,250
Get out of
any major city

2622
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:46,450
and just go camping
or something.

2623
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:47,580
You're an insane person.

2624
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:48,710
No, no,
I've involved you

2625
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:50,620
in something terrible
that's about to happen.

2626
01:58:50,690 --> 01:58:52,120
No.
Shut up,

2627
01:58:52,190 --> 01:58:53,350
shut up!

2628
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,290
Listen,
I tried, Tyler.

2629
01:58:58,370 --> 01:58:59,530
I really tried.

2630
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,530
I know you did.

2631
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,570
There are things
about you I like.

2632
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:04,130
You're smart,
you're funny,

2633
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:06,570
you're spectacular
in bed.

2634
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:09,770
But you're
intolerable.

2635
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:12,740
You have very serious
emotional problems.

2636
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,610
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek

2637
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,010
professional help.

2638
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,480
I know,
and I'm sorry.

2639
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:18,420
Yeah, you're sorry,
I'm sorry,

2640
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:19,610
everyone's sorry.
But...

2641
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:22,850
I can't
do this anymore.

2642
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,480
I can't.

2643
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,550
And I won't.

2644
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:29,150
I'm gone.

2645
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:31,760
You can't leave,
Marla,

2646
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:33,530
you're not safe!

2647
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:33,570
you're not safe!

2648
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,370
No!
Leave me alone!

2649
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:40,300
Marla, I'm trying
to protect you.

2650
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:41,900
I don't ever want
to see you again!

2651
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:43,640
That's fine, if
that's what it takes...

2652
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:45,040
You wait.
Wait right here.

2653

2654
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,650
Hold it
right there.

2655
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:51,650
- [Honking]
- Shut up!

2656
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:52,710
Shut up!

2657
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:54,650
Take this money
and get on this bus.

2658
01:59:54,690 --> 01:59:55,660
And I promise you

2659
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:56,710
I will never
bother you again

2660
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:57,690
if that's
what you want.

2661
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,020
- [Honks]
- Shut up!

2662
01:59:59,090 --> 02:00:00,420
Please get
on the bus.

2663
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:01,890
Please get
on the bus!

2664
02:00:03,660 --> 02:00:04,790
Why are you
doing this?

2665
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:06,490
Because they think you're
some kind of a threat.

2666
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:07,660
I... I can't explain it
right now,

2667
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:08,670
just trust me.

2668
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:09,670
If I see
where you're going,

2669
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:10,670
you will
not be safe.

2670
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:11,930
I'm not paying
this back.

2671
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:13,470
I consider it
asshole tax.

2672
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:15,630
That's fine. Remember,
stay out of major cities

2673
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:16,800
for at least
a couple of days, OK?

2674
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:17,810
Tyler.

2675
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:20,740
You're
the worst thing

2676
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:22,250
that ever
happened to me.

2677
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:30,690
[Honking]

2678
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:38,700
Hello.

2679
02:00:38,730 --> 02:00:40,360
I need you
to arrest me.

2680
02:00:40,430 --> 02:00:42,700
I am the leader of
a terrorist organization

2681
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:45,100
responsible for numerous
acts of vandalism,

2682
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:46,830
and assault
all over this city.

2683
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,170
...in the
metropolitan area,

2684
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:51,730
with probably a couple
hundred members.

2685
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:52,940
Chapters
have sprung up

2686
02:00:53,010 --> 02:00:55,740
in 5 or 6 other
major cities already.

2687
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:58,880
This is a tightly
regimented organization,

2688
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:01,080
with many cells
capable of operating

2689
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:04,180
completely independent
of central leadership.

2690
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,390
Look, look,
go to that house, OK?

2691
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,590
1537 Paper Street.

2692
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:10,600
That's our headquarters.

2693
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:13,190
In the back,
buried in the garden,

2694
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:16,360
you'll find the body
of Robert Paulson.

2695
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:18,370
In the basement,

2696
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,630
you're gonna find
some bathtubs

2697
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:21,230
that have been used
very recently

2698
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:25,340
to make large quantities
of nitroglycerin.

2699
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,470
I believe the plan

2700
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:28,310
is to blow up
the headquarters

2701
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:29,970
of these credit card
companies,

2702
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:31,880
and the T.R.W. building.

2703
02:01:33,650 --> 02:01:34,850
Why these buildings?

2704
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,980
Why credit card
companies?

2705
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:38,850
If you erase
the debt record,

2706
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:41,450
then we all
go back to zero.

2707
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:43,550
It'll create
total chaos.

2708
02:01:46,330 --> 02:01:47,320
Keep him talking.

2709
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,390
I need to make
a phone call.

2710
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,210
I really admire
what you're doing.

2711
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:03,780
What?

2712
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:06,080
You're a brave man
to order this.

2713
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:07,780
You're a genius,
sir.

2714
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:10,790
You said, if anyone
ever interferes

2715
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:12,660
with Project Mayhem...
even you...

2716
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:15,030
we gotta
get his balls.

2717
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,460
It's useless
to fight.

2718
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:18,660
This is really
a powerful gesture,

2719
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:19,670
Mr. Durden.

2720
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:20,960
It'll set quite
an example.

2721
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:23,160
You're making
a big mistake, fellas.

2722
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:24,170
You said
you'd say that.

2723
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:25,710
I'm not
Tyler Durden!

2724
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:27,300
You told us
you'd say that, too.

2725
02:02:27,370 --> 02:02:30,210
All right,
I am Tyler Durden.

I'm giving you
a direct order.

2728
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:35,170
We are aborting this
mission, right now.

2729
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,650
You said you would
definitely say that.

2730
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:43,850
Are you fucking
out of your minds?

2731
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,260
You're

Somebody
timing this?

02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:50,400
No! No!

2734
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:51,950

mouth shut!

02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:57,700
Yeah?

2738
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:58,800
Hey, you know, some
of this information

2739
02:02:58,870 --> 02:03:00,170
checks out.

to that house

on Paper Street.

2742
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:04,070

02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:07,770
I got him.

Sir, we have
to do this, sir.

2747
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:10,340
Stop fighting.

2748
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,710

2749
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:12,840
Get away from me!

2761
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:18,550
I ran until
my muscles burned

2762

and my veins pumped
battery acid.

2763
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,190

some more.

is Project Mayhem

are empty.

wires were what.

the whole day

not the green one.
