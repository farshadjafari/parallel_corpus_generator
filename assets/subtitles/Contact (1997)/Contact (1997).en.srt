it's gonna be a long night.

172
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:35,504
Science must first be accountable to the
people who are paying for it, the taxpayers.

173
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:39,049
We need to stop wasting money
on pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

174
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:42,177
...and start spending it on practical,
measurable ways...

175
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:45,222
...to improve the lives of the people
who are footing the bill.

176
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,518
Not unlike my L-band,
globular-clusters work.

177
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:51,729
Wait, you're saying you wanna do away
with all pure research now?

178
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:55,232
What's wrong with science being practical?
Even profitable?

179
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:59,278
Nothing, as long as your motive
is the search for truth.

180
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:02,572
Which is exactly what
the pursuit of science is.

181
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,951
That's a rather interesting position...

182

Yeah, I'll just...

188
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:34,730

with that interview. What do you think?

189
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:37,190
You're a priest?

190
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:39,942
No, not really.

191
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,697
I got my Masters in Divinity...

192
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:47,451
...then dropped out of seminary to
do some secular humanitarian work...

193
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:50,120
...coordinating efforts
for Third World churches.

194
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:53,373

the whole celibacy thing.

You could...

196
00:15:57,294 --> 00:15:59,879
You could call me a man of the cloth...

197
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:02,298

You wanna get out of here?

199
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:12,725
All right, you see that sort of large,
W-shaped constellation right there?

200
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:14,351
That's Cassiopeia.

201
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,066
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

202
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:23,736
I actually listen to them a lot.
It's a remnant of a supernova.

203
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:27,323
When did you know
you wanted to be an astronomer?

204
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,283
Well, when I...

205
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:33,288
When I was about 8 years old,
I was watching the sunset...

206
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,832
...and I asked my dad,
"What's that bright star over there?"

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,668
Dad, what's that star there?

208
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:43,338
And he said that it wasrt
really a star at all. It was actually...

209
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,173
That's not a star, it's a planet.

210
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:46,966
- A whole planet called Venus...

211
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:49,135
That's the planet Venus.

212
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:55,433
- Which should be over there soon.

213
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:58,312
He said,
"You know why they called it Venus?

214
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,774
Because they thought
it was so beautiful and glowing.

215
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:04,026
But what they didn't know...

216
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,820
...is that it's filled with...

217
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,741
...deadly gases and sulfuric acid rain."

218
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:16,997
"Wow," I thought,
"This is it! I'm hooked."

219
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,545
You know, there are four hundred billion
stars out there...

220
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,963
...just in our galaxy alone.

221
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:29,218
If only one out of a million
of those had planets...

222
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:32,555
...all right, and ifjust one
out of a million of those had life...

223
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:37,351
...and ifjust one out of a million
of those had intelligent life...

224
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:42,647
...there would be literally millions
of civilizations out there.

225

Well, if there wasrt...

just looking at the sky.

All I know is that I wasrt alone.

I wasrt scared of nothing, you know?

234
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,287
And there's no chance that...

235
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:43,708
...you had this experience because
some part of you needed to have it?

236
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,462
I mean, I'm a reasonably intelligent guy,
but this...

237
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,302

it couldn't even touch this.

Uh-huh. And?

241
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:10,151
Well, I just kept asking all these
really annoying questions like:

242
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,278
"All right, then where did Mrs. Cain
come from?"

243
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:17,157
And pretty soon they called my dad
and they asked him...

244
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:20,077
...if he wouldn't mind just
keeping me home from now on.

than at any other conventional facility.

00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,512
Those are primes.

508
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:13,266
Two, three, five, seven,
those are all prime numbers.

509
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,393
There's no way
that's a natural phenomenon.

510
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:16,686
- Holy shit.
- Okay, okay.

511
00:42:16,853 --> 00:42:20,188
Let's just calm down
and pull up the star file on Vega.

512
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:23,693
FISHER: It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young...

513
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,862
...so it can't have a planetary system...

514
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,449
...let alone life
or a technological civilization.

515
00:42:29,617 --> 00:42:32,201
Maybe they didn't grow up there.
Maybe they're visiting.

516
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:35,704
Spacecraft? This system is
full of debris. It would get clobbered.

517
00:42:35,873 --> 00:42:40,043
Well, not if they used their laser blasters
and photon torpedoes.

518
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,630
- That's not funny.
- How else are we gonna explain it?

519
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:47,007
Willie's right. If we go public with this
and we're wrong, that's it.

520
00:42:47,175 --> 00:42:49,677
It's over. We're cooked.

521
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:53,264
God, I wish Kent was here.

522
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:57,518
Whatever the signal is, we better
do something soon. Vega's gonna set.

523
00:42:58,061 --> 00:43:04,650
Position confirmed.
We've got 4.4623 gigahertz, confirmed.

524
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:07,737
We've got 112 janskys.

525
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:10,364
All right, do you have
a source location yet?

526
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:15,827
We put it right smack in the middle.

527
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:17,579
Vega.

528
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:22,416
Okay, thanks, lan. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

529
00:43:22,585 --> 00:43:24,251
Yeah, right-o.

530
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:35,931
FISHER:
Okay, 101.

531
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:40,851
The pulse sequenced through every
prime number between two and 101.

532
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:44,438
Who are we gonna call now?

533
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:48,360
Everybody.

534
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:59,538
MAN 1 [ON TV]: The rumors are flying,
the implications extraordinary.

535
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:03,333
This morning's detection of an unidentified
radio source from deep space...

536
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:06,128
...can neither be confirmed nor denied.

537
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:08,088
But the military presence arriving...

538
00:44:08,255 --> 00:44:12,134
MAN 2: Sources close to the VLA report
that the planet has been contacted...

539
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,260
...by some form of intelligent being...

540
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:17,931
...living outside of our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation...

541
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:22,018
...that the official IAU communiqué
was sent from this government facility.

542
00:44:22,186 --> 00:44:24,896
KITZ:
I want all of these people out of here.

543
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:26,856
Where's the girl?

544
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:33,947
Twenty-two stations worldwide
now confirming the signal.

545
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:35,905
Vega is currently below our horizon...

546
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,534
...so what you're hearing
is the signal from-

547
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:42,496
Get decryption people in here now.
Lunacharsky is visiting at Cal Tech.

548
00:44:42,664 --> 00:44:44,123
Explain this to me.

549
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:48,210
If the source of the signal is so
sophisticated, why the remedial math?

550
00:44:48,378 --> 00:44:50,170
Exactly, why don't they speak English?

551
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:53,548
Maybe because 70 percent of the planet
speaks other languages.

552
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:56,510
Mathematics is
the only truly universal language.

553
00:44:57,219 --> 00:44:59,804
It's no coincidence
that they're using primes.

554
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:02,224
- I don't get it.
- Prime numbers.

555
00:45:02,391 --> 00:45:06,186
That would be integers that are
only divisible by themselves and one.

556
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:12,693
We think this may be a beacon,
some kind of an announcement...

557
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,985
...to get our attention.

558
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:17,864
If it's attention you want, you got that.
One thing: Vega.

559
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:21,577
People have been looking at Vega for years
with no results.

560
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:24,579
And now yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

561
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:28,626
Well, it's hardly yesterday, because the
signal has been transmitting for 26 years.

562
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:30,251
Dr. Arroway.

563
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,632
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.

564
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,090
Let me first say that your...

565
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:40,221
Actually, first, could you ask the gentlemen
with the firearms to wait outside?

566
00:45:40,387 --> 00:45:42,389
This is supposed to be a civilian facility.

567
00:45:48,855 --> 00:45:51,481
- Doctor, with all due respect to your...
- Excuse me.

568
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:55,193
Hey, hey, hey.
Hi, I'm so glad you're back.

569
00:45:55,778 --> 00:45:58,987
Come on, I got something for you to hear.
Is this great?

570
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,574
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.

571
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:04,744
Sit down. And we could use some help
with the spectrum analysis.

572
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:06,871
- Listen to that. I'll get on it.
- Headsets.

573
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:09,123
So I'll just come right to the point,
shall I?

574
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:13,418
Your having sent this all over the world may
constitute a breach of national security.

575
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:15,255
This isn't a person-to-person call.

576
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:19,967
You can't think that a civilization sending
this would intend it just for Americans.

577
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:21,969
I'm saying you might have consulted us.

578
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:25,931
- The contents could be extremely sensitive.
- You want to classify prime numbers?

579
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,853
Mike, please. We're only in line
with Vega so many hours a day.

580
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:34,481
The only way to monitor the signal
is to get the cooperation of other stations.

581
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:39,027
If Dr. Arroway hadrt acted quickly,
we could have lost key elements.

582
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:40,822
Okay, fine, they've got the primes.

583
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:44,117
If you're right about there being a more
significant transmission...

584
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:45,952
Which will need help
to receive and decode.

585
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,954
Doctor, do you understand that my job
is to protect...?

586
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:49,914
KENT: Shh!
- What?

587
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,166
- Listen.
- I hear it.

588
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,085
- Hear what?
- Harmonic.

589
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:58,505
Bingo. I had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

590
00:46:58,673 --> 00:47:00,173
There's a lot more here, folks.

591
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:03,302
- Fish, let's get on the negative sideband.
FISHER: I'm already on it.

592
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:05,054
KITZ: What is going on?
DRUMLIN: Another signal.

593
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,556
Another signal, look at that.

594
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:09,851
A second signal at double the frequency.
It looks like a...

595
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:11,393
Somebody get a TV monitor.

596
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:14,021
Patch the recording
into the image processor.

597
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:17,483
- You want the new data?
- Yeah, the new frequency we just recorded.

598
00:47:17,693 --> 00:47:19,610
David, explain this to me, please.

599
00:47:19,777 --> 00:47:22,905
With the prime there's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

600
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:24,239
WILLIE:
We're hot.

601
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:27,492
Do me a favor, go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

602
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:29,161
You're patched in.

603
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:33,498
All right, it's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

604
00:47:37,545 --> 00:47:39,045
What do you make of that, Fish?

605
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:42,632
It's two different interlaced frames.
I'm framing one.

606
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:48,764
ELLIE: It's just noise.
FISHER: Trying frame two.

607
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:53,268
I've got an offset carrier here.
I think it's audio.

608
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:54,686
Plug it in, plug it in.

609
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:00,317
Center that segment.

610
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:02,027
FISHER:
Centering.

611
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:08,867
- Can you clean it up any more than that?
FISHER: I'm working on it.

612
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,215
What the hell...?

613
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,217
Try zooming out.

614
00:48:29,097 --> 00:48:30,222
All right, freeze.

615
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:31,722
Reverse values.

616
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:35,518
Try zooming out again.

[HITLER SPEAKING IN GERMAN

620
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,702
- Okay.
KENT: What's going on?

621
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:55,538
You're not gonna believe this.

622
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:10,719

...and he's our first ambassador
to outer space?

629
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:42,418
- Actually...
- The broadcast from the '36 Olympics...

630
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:45,588
...was the first television transmission
that went into space.

631
00:49:45,755 --> 00:49:49,132
That they recorded it and sent it back
is saying, "Hello, we heard you."

632
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,760
Or, "Sjeg Heil, you're our kind of people."

633

Wait. Hitler and his politics
have nothing to do with this.

634

It's highly unlikely they would understand,

...has been received by American scientists.
Claire Shipman is at the White House.

Good afternoon.

645
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:34,635
I'm glad to be joined by my
science and technology advisor.

646
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:39,306
This is the product
of years of exploration...

647
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:42,726
...by some of the world's
most distinguished scientists.

648
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:47,148
Like all discoveries, this one
will and should continue to be reviewed...

649
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,110
...examined and scrutinized.

650
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,403
It must be confirmed by other scientists.

651
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:59,369
The fact that something of this magnitude
is being explored is another...

652
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:03,414
Fish, what is the story over here?
I thought Ellie was supposed to be on.

653
00:51:03,623 --> 00:51:05,125
I don't know.

Guys? Guys? Um...

655
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:12,340
You know those interlaced frames
that we thought were noise?

656
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:15,844
This has structure. I'm hearing structure.

657
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:19,472
If this discovery is confirmed...

658
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:23,309
...it will be one of the most stunning
insights into our universe...

659
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,561
...that science has ever uncovered.

660
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:31,233
Its implications are as far-reaching
and awe-inspiring as can be imagined.

661
00:51:31,443 --> 00:51:34,902
Even as it promises answers
to some of our oldest questions...

662
00:51:35,112 --> 00:51:38,532
...it poses still others,
even more fundamental.

663
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,369
We will continue to listen closely
to what it has to say...

664
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:46,123
...as we continue the search for answers
and for knowledge...

665
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:52,003
...that is as old as humanity itself
but essential to our people's future.

00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:59,385
I'll answer your questions at the end,
but first a few corrections.

670

838
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,293
...but certainly being handed your hat.

839
01:05:16,715 --> 01:05:20,385
I've had a long time
to make enemies, doctor.

840
01:05:23,974 --> 01:05:27,809
And there are many governments,
business interests...

841
01:05:27,978 --> 01:05:31,980
...even religious leaders that
would like to see me depart this earth.

842
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,983
And I'll grant them their wish
soon enough.

843
01:05:36,527 --> 01:05:40,070
But before I do,
I wish to make a small contribution.

844
01:05:40,822 --> 01:05:45,409
A final gesture of goodwill to the
people of this little planet that have given...

845
01:05:48,204 --> 01:05:50,998
From whom I have taken so much.

846
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,920
You found the primer.

847
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,215
Clever girl.

848
01:06:00,384 --> 01:06:01,425
Lights.

849
01:06:10,018 --> 01:06:13,186
Pages and pages of data.

850
01:06:13,355 --> 01:06:16,481
Over 63,000 in all.

851
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,735
And on the perimeter of each...

852
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:22,530
Alignment symbols, a registration mark,
but they don't line up.

853
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:26,284
They do, if you think like a Vegan.

854
01:06:27,202 --> 01:06:30,204
An alien intelligence
has got be more advanced...

855
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:34,458
...and that means efficiency
functioning on multiple levels...

856
01:06:34,626 --> 01:06:38,463
...and in multiple dimensions.

857
01:06:42,425 --> 01:06:44,844
Yes, of course!

859
01:06:46,554 --> 01:06:47,972
You'll see.

860
01:06:48,474 --> 01:06:52,934
Every three-dimensional page
contains a piece of the primer.

861
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,606
There it was all the time,
staring you in the face.

862
01:06:59,692 --> 01:07:03,612
Buried within the message itself
is the key to decoding it.

863
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,032
Within the layering of the matrix,
we have these basic equations:

864
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:13,038
So with this very elementary foundation,
they have given us a kind of...

865
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:15,791
...general scientific vocabulary.

866
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,293
We now have the symbols
for true and false...

867
01:07:18,503 --> 01:07:19,795
This was the key...

868
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:22,463
...that allowed us
to decipher their language...

869
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:26,342
...for physics, geometry, chemistry.
Next frame, Ellie.

870
01:07:27,552 --> 01:07:31,514
Yes, and when we apply this
to the rest of the message...

871
01:07:32,266 --> 01:07:33,349
...we find this.

872
01:07:37,938 --> 01:07:40,856
Those look like engineering schematics,
almost like blueprints.

873
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:42,650
Yeah.

874
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:43,902
Yes.

875
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:47,364
It is our belief that
the message contains instructions...

876
01:07:47,572 --> 01:07:51,034
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

877
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:54,329
A machine? That does what, doctor?

878
01:07:54,496 --> 01:07:56,706
We don't know.
It might be some type...

879
01:07:57,666 --> 01:08:03,213
...of advanced communication device,
or a teaching machine of some kind.

880
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:07,007
Or it might turn out to be
some kind of a transport.

881
01:08:07,425 --> 01:08:09,885
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.

882
01:08:10,054 --> 01:08:13,889
The fact is, you don't know what it does.
It could be anything.

883
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:17,393
Could be a Trojan horse. We build it
and out pours the entire Vegan army.

884
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,229
Why bother risking the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

885
01:08:20,438 --> 01:08:22,730
Right. Some kind of
a doomsday machine.

886
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:25,400
Exactly. Every time they detect
a new civilization...

887
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:28,028
...they fax these construction documents
from space.

888
01:08:28,195 --> 01:08:31,823
We poor saps build whatever this is
and blow ourselves to kingdom come.

889
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:34,909
There's no reason to believe
that their intentions are hostile.

890
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:39,414
Why is the default position of the egghead
set that aliens would always be benign?

891
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,042
- Why is that, doctor?
- We pose no threat to them.

892
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:46,630
It would be like us going out of our way
to destroy microbes on an anthill in Africa

893
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:48,381
DRUMLIN:
That's an interesting analogy.

894
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,970
And how guilty would we feel if we
destroyed a few microbes on an anthill?

895
01:08:53,137 --> 01:08:55,514
I hope you're right, doctor. I really do.

01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:59,143
But right now my job is to protect
American lives from any threat.

897
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,645
In that regard, I am obligated
to assume the worst.

898
01:09:01,896 --> 01:09:03,980
Well, yes, and I am forced
to agree with you.

My problem is this:

900
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:09,403
The content of that message
is morally ambiguous at best.

901

Now, our internal numbers show
support for this is incredibly soft.

any opinions here today.

910
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:39,140
No, of course not. I understand.

911
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:41,475
What I meant to say...

912
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:45,104
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

913
01:09:45,271 --> 01:09:48,649
Now, if it had been religious in nature,
it should have taken the form...

914
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,444
...of a burning bush
or a booming voice from the sky.

915
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,738
But a voice from the sky...

916
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,658
...is exactly what you found,
Doctor Arroway.

I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

918
01:10:03,164 --> 01:10:08,377
Now, I agree with Mr. Rank
that there are unavoidable...

919
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:10,755
...religious implications at stake here.

920
01:10:10,922 --> 01:10:13,341
But that doesn't justify
taking an alarmist position.

921
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:18,136
My hope here is that we can find
a common ground...

922

that may have kept us apart.

1004
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:09,650
MAN: I'm gonna miss
my mother's birthday party.

1005
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:12,695
KITZ: Call her in the morning,
tell her why you didn't show up.

1006
01:16:12,863 --> 01:16:14,363
Tell me.

1007
01:16:14,532 --> 01:16:15,657
They're gonna build it.

1008
01:16:15,824 --> 01:16:16,867
Who gets to go?

1009
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:20,369
The president's just gone international
to spread the risk and cost...

1010
01:16:20,537 --> 01:16:22,079
Who gets to go, though?

1011
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:23,873
Well, it's complicated, Ellie.

1012
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:25,833
What?

1013
01:16:26,002 --> 01:16:28,837
They have formed a group
of international candidates.

1014
01:16:29,005 --> 01:16:31,047
Now, it's your discovery.

1015
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:35,344
Okay, they understand that.
You're at the top of a very short list.

1016
01:16:35,511 --> 01:16:38,055
But they're also putting together
a selection committee.

1017
01:16:38,221 --> 01:16:42,390
It's made of scholars, theologians,
scientists, philosophers...

1018
01:16:42,559 --> 01:16:43,559
You're on it.

1019
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:46,061
I've been asked, yes.

1020
01:16:49,024 --> 01:16:50,690
I guess that means...

1021
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:54,028
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...

1022
01:16:54,195 --> 01:16:55,529
Yeah.

1023
01:16:55,697 --> 01:16:58,114
What you don't understand, Ellie, is...

1024
01:16:58,283 --> 01:17:00,408
- I understand.
- Ellie...

1025
01:17:01,036 --> 01:17:05,372
I want you to know, whatever happens,
as far as I'm concerned...

1026
01:17:05,957 --> 01:17:07,457
Well...

1027
01:17:08,627 --> 01:17:10,211
...good luck.

1028
01:17:14,216 --> 01:17:17,676
Well, whatever you do, make sure
he doesn't monopolize the committee.

1029
01:17:17,844 --> 01:17:19,929
He is not on the committee, Ellie.

1030
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:23,099
What?

1031
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:26,935
He just resigned as science advisor.
He wants to be the one to go.

1032
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:32,440
MAN [ON TV]: The president is already
beginning to feel the financial pinch.

1033
01:17:32,734 --> 01:17:34,819
Sources say the cost of the project...

1034
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:38,613
...is spiraling
to more than a third of a trillion dollars...

1035
01:17:38,782 --> 01:17:42,368
...making this what may be
the most expensive single project...

1036
01:17:42,577 --> 01:17:44,453
...in all of human history.

1037
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:47,997
Meanwhile, months of debate finally
reached a conclusion last week...

1038
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:51,292
...as 10 candidates
were selected by the IMC...

1039
01:17:51,461 --> 01:17:55,422
...representing a cross section of
political, philosophical and religious views.

1040
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:58,509
Many of these are the same experts
who have been consulting...

1041
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:00,720
...on the Machine's design and function.

1042
01:18:00,929 --> 01:18:05,140
They will be actively participating on-site
during the construction process.

1043
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,643
But the choice of these 10 candidates
has not been without controversy.

1044
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,645
Fully one-third of the candidates
are American.

1045
01:18:11,814 --> 01:18:14,565
Many international observers
are asking why.

1046
01:18:14,734 --> 01:18:17,860
The U.S. Is shouldering an
enormous percentage of the financial...

1047
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:21,029
Isn't it true that the contractors,
like Hadden Industries...

1048
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:24,576
...are making those contributions
in exchange for technology rights?

1049
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:28,287
Different nations are being compensated
in different ways. For example...

1050
01:18:28,456 --> 01:18:33,001
Japan made headlines when it announced it
would forego candidate representation...

1051
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:36,378
...in exchange for the systems integration
subcontract.

1052
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:41,509
On what basis do you choose
a human being to represent humanity?

1053
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:42,926
Good question, Larry.

1054
01:18:43,095 --> 01:18:45,054
Yes, well, if nothing else...

1055
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:49,225
...it should be somebody who is fluent in
the language the message was given in.

1056
01:18:49,393 --> 01:18:50,601
Science, in this case.

1057
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:53,645
Doctor Arroway,
despite your obvious enthusiasm...

1058
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:56,064
...there's been a lot of criticism of late...

1059
01:18:56,317 --> 01:18:58,818
...that this whole endeavor
is simply too dangerous.

1060
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:01,570
Some of that criticism from scientists.

1061
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,573
One Nobel Prize winner recently noted,
his words:

1062
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,076
"There is every indication...

1063
01:19:07,286 --> 01:19:11,079
...that this is simply beyond our capabilities,
that this endeavor will fail...

1064
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:14,917
...and that the Machine's occupant
will pay for that failure with their life."

1065
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:16,752
How do you respond to that?

1066
01:19:16,962 --> 01:19:20,340
ELLIE: Well, this message is from
a civilization that may be anywhere...

1067
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:24,260
...from hundreds to millions
and millions of years ahead of us.

1068
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:27,679
I have to believe that
an intelligence that advanced...

1069
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,306
...knows what they're doing.

1070
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:35,186
Now all it requires on our part is...

1071
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,395
Faith?

1072
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:41,568
I was gonna say a sense of adventure.

1073
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:42,985
MAN:
And in breaking news...

1074
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,863
...a former astronaut...

1075
01:19:45,073 --> 01:19:48,908
...considered to be the leading American
candidate for the Machine seat...

1076
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,411
...has unexpectedly dropped out
of the running.

1077
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:54,914
Russell met with reporters this afternoon
at his Houston home.

1078
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:59,211
I told my dad
that I didn't want him to go.

1079
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,128
Daddy, don't go.

1080
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,885
Nothing would give me more pride
than to...

1081
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:09,555
...represent my country.

1082
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,931
But what can I say to this?

1083
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:16,353
Consortium officials had no comment,
but sources within the delegation...

1084
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,521
...have disclosed that Dr. Arroway...

1085
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:22,775
...appears to now be the front-runner
for the Machine seat.

1086
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,988
ELLIE:
"Meet me at noon. Must talk."

1087
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,907
I didn't expect to be getting
a message like this from you.

1088
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,283
Thanks for coming.

1089
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,453
So is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1090
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:37,123
Selectors and selectees mingling around?

1091
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:39,458
Can we talk about Einstein?

1092
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:41,795
Yeah, sure. Okay.

1093
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,380
- Special relativity.
- Yeah.

1094
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,172
This machine...

1095
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:50,677
...now, if it works, and you travel to Vega
at even close to the speed of light...

1096
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:53,346
...when you come back...
- If you come back.

1097
01:20:55,516 --> 01:20:57,518
If you come back...

1098
01:20:57,685 --> 01:21:01,980
...you'll only be 4 years older, but over
50 years would have passed here on Earth.

1099
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,858
Basically, yeah.

1100
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,944
And everybody that you care about...

1101
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,155
...will be gone, dead and buried.

1102
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:14,993
If you came back,
if you survived at all, which...

1103
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:20,041
Look, Palmer, nobody's saying
this isn't dangerous, all right?

1104
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:24,337
The rest of the candidates and myself,
we fully understand the risks we're taking.

1105
01:21:24,503 --> 01:21:25,755
Why?

1106
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:28,632
Because it's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

1107
01:21:28,841 --> 01:21:31,469
No, you, Ellie. You. You personally.

1108
01:21:32,511 --> 01:21:35,305
By doing this,
you're willing to give your life.

1109
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:37,682
You're willing to die for it.

1110
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:40,810
Why?

1111
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:48,234
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

1112
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,529
...something...

1113
01:21:50,738 --> 01:21:54,533
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?

1114
01:21:55,534 --> 01:21:59,412
If this is a chance to find out
even just a little part of that answer...

1115
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,917
I don't know,
I think it's won'th a human life.

1116
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,127
Don't you?

1117
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,261
You're an incredibly brave woman, Ellie.

1118
01:22:18,056 --> 01:22:20,182
Or incredibly nuts.

1119
01:22:42,247 --> 01:22:43,747
Palmer...

1120
01:22:49,462 --> 01:22:51,547
I'm really confused.

1121
01:22:52,841 --> 01:22:54,091
So am I.

1122
01:22:55,344 --> 01:22:58,930
I think I speak for us all
when I thank you for your patience.

1123
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,600
Myself, I have one final question,
Dr. Arroway.

1124
01:23:04,103 --> 01:23:06,438
If you should meet these Vegans...

1125
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:10,942
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

1126
01:23:11,109 --> 01:23:12,777
...what would it be?

1127
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:16,280
Well, I suppose it would be:

1128
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,115
"How did you do it?

1129
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:23,121
How did you evolve? How did you
survive this technological adolescence...

1130
01:23:23,288 --> 01:23:25,206
...without destroying yourself?"

1131
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:30,837
That more than any other question is one
I personally would like to have answered.

1132
01:23:31,171 --> 01:23:33,006
Not too bad, Mike.

1133
01:23:33,673 --> 01:23:34,966
PATEL:
I join Dr. Bergeron...

1134
01:23:35,134 --> 01:23:38,594
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

1135
01:23:38,802 --> 01:23:41,305
We've all been most impressed
with your candor...

1136
01:23:41,472 --> 01:23:43,515
...and your stamina.

1137
01:23:43,682 --> 01:23:46,851
I believe we are ready to move on
to your final statement.

1138
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,936
Madam Chairman,
I have one more question.

1139
01:23:49,104 --> 01:23:50,855
Yes, Mr. Joss.

1140
01:23:51,483 --> 01:23:53,484
Dr. Arroway...

1141
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:57,195
Would you consider yourself...

1142
01:23:57,697 --> 01:24:00,323
...a spiritual person?

1143
01:24:02,993 --> 01:24:04,744
Uh...

1144
01:24:05,497 --> 01:24:08,832
I don't really understand
the point of the question.

1145
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,877
I consider myself a moral person.

1146
01:24:12,045 --> 01:24:14,003
PATEL:
I'm sure we all agree that is the case...

1147
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:16,672
...but I think what Mr. Joss
is in fact asking...

1148
01:24:16,841 --> 01:24:18,675
Do you believe in God...

1149
01:24:20,677 --> 01:24:22,679
...Dr. Arroway?

1150
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:29,603
As a scientist...

1151
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:33,231
...I rely on empirical evidence,
and in this matter...

1152
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:37,110
...I don't believe
that there is data either way.

1153
01:24:37,694 --> 01:24:42,115
PATEL: So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

1154
01:24:45,537 --> 01:24:48,579
I don't understand the relevance
of the question.

1155
01:24:49,289 --> 01:24:54,418
Dr. Arroway,
95 percent of the world's population...

1156
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:58,548
...believes in a supreme being
in one form or another.

1157
01:24:59,716 --> 01:25:02,926
I believe that makes the question
more than relevant.

1158
01:25:05,596 --> 01:25:07,305
PATEL:
Dr. Arroway?

1159
01:25:17,234 --> 01:25:19,234
I believe, um...

1160
01:25:23,239 --> 01:25:25,740
I believe I've already
answered that question.

1161
01:25:29,787 --> 01:25:33,291
I'm proud of what
we've achieved as a species...

1162
01:25:33,457 --> 01:25:35,458
...and as a civilization.

1163
01:25:37,128 --> 01:25:39,630
I would hate to see
everything we stand for...

1164
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:43,717
...all that we have fought for
for a thousand generations...

1165
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:46,261
...all that God has blessed us with...

1166
01:25:47,597 --> 01:25:49,140
...betrayed...

1167
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:54,686
...in the final hour because we chose to
send a representative who did not put our...

1168
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:57,981
...most cherished beliefs first.

1169
01:26:01,278 --> 01:26:02,444

Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

I just couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

With full humility and utmost gratitude...

01:53:05,922 --> 01:53:08,381
We have auxiliary booster ignition.

1500
01:53:14,055 --> 01:53:15,555
Life support, how is she doing?

1501
01:53:15,724 --> 01:53:18,975
We still have data. Heart and respiration
are high but within limits.

1502
01:53:19,144 --> 01:53:20,228
Ellie, do you copy?

1503
01:53:20,436 --> 01:53:23,439
If you could hear, I am okay to go.

1504
01:53:27,235 --> 01:53:29,028
If you could hear me...

1505
01:53:32,114 --> 01:53:33,490
Eighty percent.

1506
01:53:33,658 --> 01:53:36,493
All vibration and G-levels are in the green.

1507
01:53:41,917 --> 01:53:44,252
Control, if you're reading me...

1508
01:53:44,418 --> 01:53:46,753
...I am okay to go. Okay to go,

1509
01:53:46,921 --> 01:53:50,716
GERRY: Eighty-five percent.
MAN: All bearing tips are on the profile.

1510
01:53:51,592 --> 01:53:54,679
Ninety percent. We're detecting
some structural instability.

1511
01:53:54,846 --> 01:53:58,765
- Confirmed. Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.

1512
01:54:00,269 --> 01:54:06,189
I'm okay to go.

1513
01:54:12,113 --> 01:54:13,573
My God!

1514
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:27,127
Okay to go. I'm okay.

1515
01:54:27,545 --> 01:54:29,045
Hundred percent target velocity.

1516
01:54:29,212 --> 01:54:30,421
MAN:
Steve?

1517
01:54:30,590 --> 01:54:34,967
Tremendous EMI levels around the Machine.
All field measurements are off-scale.

1518
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:37,595
Steve, we're approaching our abort limits.

1519
01:54:39,974 --> 01:54:41,056
Okay to go.

1520
01:54:46,271 --> 01:54:47,479
I hear her!

1521
01:54:47,648 --> 01:54:50,483
I hear her. Barely, but she's there.

1522
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:53,653
- Okay to go.
- She says she's okay to go.

1523
01:54:56,657 --> 01:54:58,783
Steve, we're real close.

1524
01:54:58,951 --> 01:55:01,828
- Electrical, reading in the core?
MAN: Internal environment normal.

1525
01:55:01,996 --> 01:55:04,997
Inside the core, the weather's beautiful.

1526
01:55:09,086 --> 01:55:10,337
I'm okay to go.

1527
01:55:10,837 --> 01:55:14,298
Okay to go. I'm okay to go.

1528
01:55:14,884 --> 01:55:17,217
STEVE:
Initiate drop sequence.

1529
01:55:19,805 --> 01:55:21,514
On my mark.

1530
01:55:22,224 --> 01:55:24,768
Ten, nine...

1531
01:55:25,853 --> 01:55:27,854
...eight...

1532
01:55:28,189 --> 01:55:31,190
...seven, six...

1533
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:33,984
...five, four...

1534
01:55:34,153 --> 01:55:36,820
...three, two...

1535
01:55:36,988 --> 01:55:38,364
I'm okay to go.

1536
01:55:42,328 --> 01:55:44,118
Oh, God!

1537
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:55,046
Ellie to Control.

1538
01:55:55,715 --> 01:56:05,765
Ellie to Control, do you read me?

1539
01:56:11,523 --> 01:56:14,942
I'm gonna try to keep recording.

1540
01:56:15,694 --> 01:56:20,238
I'm going through
some kind of a tunnel.

1541
01:56:34,921 --> 01:56:36,462
There's a light source ahead.

1542
01:56:36,965 --> 01:56:40,175
Brilliant and blue-white.

1543
01:56:41,386 --> 01:56:43,011
Residual radiation?

1544
01:56:54,774 --> 01:56:56,065
It's a star.

1545
01:56:56,650 --> 01:57:00,069
I must have gone through a wormhole.

1546
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:06,534
It's Vega.

1547
01:57:17,755 --> 01:57:19,296
I'm in another wormhole now.

1548
01:57:22,967 --> 01:57:24,092
I had no idea.

1549
01:57:24,261 --> 01:57:26,054
A series of them.

1550
01:57:29,057 --> 01:57:30,307
They're alive.

1551
01:57:30,475 --> 01:57:34,436
It's like some kind of a transit system.

1552
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:36,814
It's a subway.

1553
01:57:36,981 --> 01:57:38,483
[YELLS]

1554
01:57:42,154 --> 01:57:43,945
Okay.

1555
01:57:44,113 --> 01:57:46,407
Okay, I've gotta keep talking.

1556
01:57:48,952 --> 01:57:52,829
It's a triple... No, quadruple system.

1557
01:57:53,247 --> 01:57:54,498
It's beautiful.

1558
01:57:57,836 --> 01:57:59,252
They're alive.

1559
01:58:07,429 --> 01:58:09,096
Another wormhole!

1560
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:11,265
This one is much more violent!

1561
01:59:44,692 --> 01:59:46,359
Some...

1562
01:59:46,819 --> 01:59:49,154
...celestial event...

1563
01:59:50,405 --> 01:59:52,114
No...

1564
01:59:52,283 --> 01:59:55,951
No words. No words...

1565
01:59:57,621 --> 01:59:59,829
...to describe it.

1566
02:00:01,248 --> 02:00:03,125
Poetry.

1567
02:00:04,293 --> 02:00:07,796
They should have sent a poet.

1568
02:00:08,088 --> 02:00:10,673
It's so beautiful.

1569
02:00:10,841 --> 02:00:12,301
Beautiful.

1570
02:00:14,136 --> 02:00:19,432
So beautiful.

1571
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:26,899
I had no idea.

1572
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:31,487
I had no...

1573
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:36,074
I had no idea.

1574
02:00:37,409 --> 02:00:44,416
I had no idea. I had no idea.

1575
02:03:02,386 --> 02:03:03,761
Hi, Sparks.

1576
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:07,140
Dad?

1577
02:03:14,606 --> 02:03:16,483
I missed you.

1578
02:03:22,114 --> 02:03:23,280
Arert you...?

1579
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:26,701
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there for you, sweetheart.

1580
02:03:36,503 --> 02:03:38,171
You're not real.

1581
02:03:39,673 --> 02:03:41,173
None of this is real.

1582
02:03:41,341 --> 02:03:43,510
That's my scientist.

1583
02:03:44,595 --> 02:03:48,974
When I was unconscious, you downloaded
my thoughts, my memory even.

1584
02:03:49,809 --> 02:03:51,851
Pensacola.

1585
02:03:54,354 --> 02:03:57,314
We thought this might
make things easier for you.

1586
02:04:10,828 --> 02:04:14,457
- Why did you contact us?
- You contacted us.

1587
02:04:14,623 --> 02:04:16,292
We were just listening.

1588
02:04:17,168 --> 02:04:18,461
And there are others?

1589
02:04:18,627 --> 02:04:20,253
Many others.

1590
02:04:25,092 --> 02:04:26,594
They all...

1591
02:04:26,761 --> 02:04:29,889
...travel here through that
transit system that you built?

1592
02:04:30,431 --> 02:04:31,931
We didn't build it.

1593
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:34,601
We don't know who did.

1594
02:04:36,688 --> 02:04:39,648
No, they were gone
long before we ever got here.

1595
02:04:40,274 --> 02:04:42,109
Maybe someday they'll come back.

1596
02:04:42,944 --> 02:04:45,654
All the other civilizations that you find,
they come here?

1597
02:04:45,863 --> 02:04:47,072
Not all.

1598
02:04:48,867 --> 02:04:52,036
- Is this some test?
- No, no tests.

1599
02:04:54,956 --> 02:04:56,539
You have your mother's hands.

1600
02:05:06,717 --> 02:05:08,886
You're an interesting species...

1601
02:05:09,554 --> 02:05:11,514
...an interesting mix.

1602
02:05:12,431 --> 02:05:15,225
You're capable of
such beautiful dreams...

1603
02:05:16,269 --> 02:05:18,729
...and such horrible nightmares.

1604
02:05:19,898 --> 02:05:21,731
You feel so lost...

1605
02:05:22,317 --> 02:05:25,277
...so cut off, so alone.

1606
02:05:26,738 --> 02:05:28,488
Only you're not.

1607
02:05:30,573 --> 02:05:32,115
See...

1608
02:05:32,576 --> 02:05:34,202
In all our searching...

1609
02:05:34,411 --> 02:05:37,913
...the only thing we've found
that makes the emptiness bearable...

1610
02:05:38,082 --> 02:05:39,707
...is each other.

1611
02:05:43,462 --> 02:05:45,380
What happens now?

1612
02:05:46,422 --> 02:05:47,923
Now?

1613
02:05:48,841 --> 02:05:50,635
You go home.

1614
02:05:50,802 --> 02:05:52,220
ELLIE:
Home?

1615
02:05:52,387 --> 02:05:55,472
But I have so many questions.

1616
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:57,766
Do we get to come back?

1617
02:05:58,644 --> 02:06:00,895
This was just a first step.

1618
02:06:01,063 --> 02:06:02,814
In time, you'll take another.

1619
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:06,775
But other people need to see
what I've seen...

1620
02:06:06,944 --> 02:06:09,988
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.

1621
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:14,617
- But I...
- Small moves, Ellie.

1622
02:06:16,078 --> 02:06:17,996
Small moves.

1623
02:07:01,079 --> 02:07:02,872
We've got video on Ellie.
Five-by-five.

1624
02:07:03,082 --> 02:07:04,957
STEVE:
She's through! She is in the net.

1625
02:07:05,126 --> 02:07:08,127
She's alive. Get the White House.
Get the president on the phone.

1626
02:07:08,296 --> 02:07:10,671
What's going on, Steve? How is she?
How is she?

1627
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,548
STEVE:
Ellie, this is Control. Do you copy?

1628
02:07:12,716 --> 02:07:14,760
KENT: What's going on?
- I don't know. Hang on.

1629
02:07:14,926 --> 02:07:16,552
- She is alive.
STEVE: Put her on the PA.

1630
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,305
Ellie, just hold on tight.

1631
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:22,225
We're still trying to determine
the nature of the malfunction...

1632
02:07:22,393 --> 02:07:24,895
...but the important thing is you're okay.

1633
02:07:25,063 --> 02:07:26,229
What?

1634
02:07:26,396 --> 02:07:30,192
It's all right, Ellie.
The important thing is that you're safe.

1635
02:07:31,152 --> 02:07:33,444
What malfunction?

1636
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:36,238
What...?

1637
02:07:37,408 --> 02:07:39,033
What happened?

1638
02:07:40,369 --> 02:07:42,037
What day is this?

1639
02:07:42,704 --> 02:07:45,707
I'm sorry, Ellie,
did you say what day?

1640
02:07:46,792 --> 02:07:49,043
How long was I gone?

1641
02:07:50,796 --> 02:07:55,591
Ellie, the IPV dropped
straight through the Machine.

1642
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:57,426
You didn't go anywhere.

1643
02:07:58,304 --> 02:08:01,640
But I did. I did go.

1644
02:08:01,807 --> 02:08:04,184
That's what I've been trying
to tell everyone.

1645
02:08:08,648 --> 02:08:11,733
But the headset
didn't record a single image?

1646
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:14,528
Just this. Static.

1647
02:08:14,737 --> 02:08:15,779
Thank you.

1648
02:08:15,947 --> 02:08:19,364
Now, doctor, let me show you
what we saw.

1649
02:08:28,833 --> 02:08:32,670
Forty-three separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

1650
02:08:32,837 --> 02:08:34,380
The IPV dropped straight through.

1651
02:08:34,547 --> 02:08:38,134
Everyone who watched
saw exactly the same thing.

1652
02:08:38,301 --> 02:08:40,136
Nothing happened.

1653
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:43,764
How do you explain this, doctor?

1654
02:08:45,766 --> 02:08:46,891
I can't.

1655
02:08:47,101 --> 02:08:48,560
CLINTON:
I would encourage you...

1656
02:08:50,354 --> 02:08:54,524
...not to inflame this situation
beyond the facts.

1657
02:08:54,693 --> 02:08:58,112
Let us deal with this on the facts.

1658
02:08:58,279 --> 02:09:01,157
We are monitoring
what has actually happened.

1659
02:09:01,323 --> 02:09:06,662
We are taking what we believe
is factually appropriate steps.

1660
02:09:06,829 --> 02:09:10,039
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

1661
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,835
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

1662
02:09:13,002 --> 02:09:15,921
...the president has ordered
a special inquiry.

1663
02:09:16,131 --> 02:09:18,923
However, the appointment
to the committee of Michael Kitz...

1664
02:09:19,134 --> 02:09:21,969
...who has recently resigned
as National Security Advisor...

1665
02:09:22,136 --> 02:09:24,471
...has raised a number of eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

1666
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:28,434
I have made no decision to run for
Congress, I have announced no candidacy.

1667
02:09:28,601 --> 02:09:31,186
The fact that I resigned
as National Security Advisor...

1668
02:09:31,354 --> 02:09:33,063
...has nothing to do with anything...

1669
02:09:33,230 --> 02:09:36,399
...other than I want to devote
all of my energy to this inquiry.

1670
02:09:37,152 --> 02:09:41,820
The people of the world have a right
to know what really happened.

1671
02:09:42,655 --> 02:09:45,158
And yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

1672
02:09:45,326 --> 02:09:49,496
...the IPV was out of contact
for only a fraction of a second.

1673
02:09:49,662 --> 02:09:51,706
Isn't that correct, doctor?

SENATOR:
Earth time?

1676
02:09:58,005 --> 02:10:01,632
ELLIE: Senator, I believe that the Machine
opened up a wormhole...

1677
02:10:01,801 --> 02:10:06,762
...a tunnel through the fabric of space-time,
also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1678
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:11,059
Now, because of the effects of general
relativity, what I experienced as 18 hours...

1679
02:10:11,226 --> 02:10:13,478
...passed instantaneously on Earth.

1680
02:10:13,645 --> 02:10:17,981
Isn't it true that these wormholes you
speak of are merely theoretical predictions?

1681
02:10:18,149 --> 02:10:20,902
There is no evidence
they actually exist, is there?

1682
02:10:21,069 --> 02:10:22,779
ELLIE:
There is no direct evidence, no.

Tell me something, doctor...

1684
02:10:24,864 --> 02:10:27,992
...why do you think these aliens
would go to all this trouble?

1685
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:32,372
Bring you tens of thousands of light years
and then send you home without proof?

1686
02:10:33,039 --> 02:10:35,750
They said that's how it's been done
for billions of years.

1687
02:10:36,126 --> 02:10:39,712
KITZ: That's very neat. You have no proof
because they didn't want you to have any.

1688
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:44,634
A phenomenon known in psychiatric circles,
I believe, as a self-reinforcing delusion.

KITZ: Well, I do think you may have suffered
some kind of an episode. Yeah, I do.

1691
02:10:51,307 --> 02:10:54,185
Doctor, I'd like to propose
an alternate hypothesis...

1692
02:10:54,395 --> 02:10:58,064
...and I'd like you to bring
your scientific expertise to bear on it.

1693

To fake a signal from Vega...

02:11:02,110 --> 02:11:03,694
...what would you need?

1695
02:11:05,404 --> 02:11:09,198
You would need a satellite to transmit
the signal, but it would be impossible to...

1696
02:11:09,367 --> 02:11:13,287
You'd need a satellite and need launch
capabilities to put the satellite into orbit.

1697
02:11:13,453 --> 02:11:16,664
And the message itself.
To put something like this together...

1698
02:11:16,832 --> 02:11:19,126
...so complex,
drawing on many disciplines...

1699
02:11:19,293 --> 02:11:21,252
- Would be impossible.
KITZ: Impossible?

Impossible?

Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

eccentric enough to come up with the idea?

02:11:41,189 --> 02:11:43,649

S. R. Hadden...

02:11:53,994 --> 02:11:58,873
...a legendary power broker and manipulator
in perhaps his final bid for immortality.

1712
02:11:59,042 --> 02:12:01,710
Maybe he wanted to explore
and exploit new technologies...

1713
02:12:01,877 --> 02:12:04,087
...and get the governments
to pick up the tab.

1714
02:12:04,296 --> 02:12:07,048
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

1715

...to unite the world in some common goal.
Maybe all of the above.

S. R. Hadden, a brilliant
and complicated man.

Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

1718
02:12:23,065 --> 02:12:25,192
...known as Occam's razor?

1719

Yes.

It means that all things being equal...

tends to be the right one.

KITZ:
Exactly.

Now, you tell me.
What is more likely here?

02:12:43,835 --> 02:12:47,296
That a message from aliens
results in a magical machine...

...that whisks you away
to the center of the galaxy...

is the result of being...

Yes.

You admit that you very well may have

- Yes.
- You admit that if you were in our position...

...you would respond with exactly the same
degree of incredulity and skepticism?

Yes.

02:14:27,645 --> 02:14:30,606
Then why don't you simply withdraw
your testimony and concede...

...that this journey to the center of
the galaxy in fact never took place?
