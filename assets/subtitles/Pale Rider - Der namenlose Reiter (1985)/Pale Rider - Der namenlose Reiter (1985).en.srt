2
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,800
Well, lookie here.

3
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,223
Lindsey?

4
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,718
Megan!

5
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,012
Lindsey?

6
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,610
Megan.

7
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,608
Help me put up the tent.

8
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,237
It's unfair!

9
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:41,500
Those sow-wallowing monkeys' asses.

10
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:47,692
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

11
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:51,111
But I do want.

12
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,950
He leadeth me beside still waters.

13
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,744
He restoreth my soul.

14
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:01,038
But they killed my dog.

15
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,128
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

16
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,589
I shall fear no evil.

17
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,174
But I am afraid.

18
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,470
For thou art with me.

19
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,014
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

20
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,519
But we need a miracle.

21
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,192
Thy loving kindness and mercy...

22
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,529
shall follow me all the days of my life.

23
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,825
If you exist.

24
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,998
And I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

25
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,169
But I'd like to get
more out of this life first.

26
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,841
If you don't help us...

27
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,759
we're all gonna die.

28
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,807
Please?

29
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:04,602
Just one miracle?

30
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,692
Amen.

31
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,902
Quitting, Mr. Barret?

32
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,488
I'm not quitting, Eddie,
just going into town.

33
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,698
Well, ain't that kind of dumb, Mr. Barret?

34
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,409
You remember what happened
to you last time.

35
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,129
- Are you quitting, Mr. Barret?
- Just going to town, Teddy.

36
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,173
Ain't that kind of dumb
after what happened last time?

37
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,504
It's Barret.

38
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,173
Good afternoon, Mrs. B.

39
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,551
- Well, Hull.
- Mr. B.

40
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,510
Damn fool.

41
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,389
Couldn't you wait
till the smoke cleared away?

42
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,517
We seem to need a few supplies.

43
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:52,394
All new camp, the way I hear it.

44
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,649
You got sand, boy, but you ain't got
the sense God gave a sack of beans.

45
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,195
Yeah, well, we don't have much choice.
They ruined the McPherson shack.

46
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:04,990
Bust up a couple others. If it's gonna
snow, the children'll catch their deaths.

47
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:08,452
Clarence. Go on.

48
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,375
I expect you're gonna pay
for all this in gold, right?

49
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,712
Yep. Soon as I put together
a couple ounces, I'll bring them in.

50
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:24,594
It'll take a damn sight more than a couple
ounces. Mother, throw me that ledger.

51
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:27,263
The last payment you folks made...

52
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,392
was eight months ago,
when old Lindquist brought his dust in.

53
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,727
There ain't no color left in Carbon Creek.

54
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:36,523
If there wasn't, why is LaHood
set on driving us out?

55
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,732
Maybe he ain't used to being said no to.

56
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,735
Oh, there's color. There's nuggets too.

57
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,529
Spider panned one out this morning
big as your thumbnail.

58
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,572
Spider Conway?
Tell that son of a bitch...

59
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,576
I got him down here for $85.33.

60
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,996
Forty-three cents.
He wants some cyanide to bleach his dust.

61
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,665
Oh, that tears it.

62
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,419
You tell Spider and the rest of them
that this is the end of the line.

63
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:02,215
The tit's gone dry.
No more credit, you hear?

64
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,927
You're a decent man and,
you know, I...

65
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,263
Well, we're all grateful
for what you've done.

66
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,307
Don't coddle me, son.
I ain't doing this for you.

67
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,519
Hell, I'm the only merchant in town
LaHood doesn't own.

68
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,441
It does my soul good
to see a few extra thorns in his side.

69
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:26,280
One day we'll strike it big. And
when we do, I'll pay you off myself.

70
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,365
With interest, Mrs. B.

71
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,076
Barret...

72
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,705
you just get your goods
in that wagon and skedaddle.

73
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,292
Just keep moving no matter
what they say, all right?

74
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,919
- So long.
- You take care, Hull.

75
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,403
We got a beef with you, Barret.

76
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,326
When we rode through the canyon,
you plumb forgot to say hello.

77
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,785
Told you to stay out of town
a while back too.

78
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:16,496
When he kicked your head,
it must've jarred your memory.

79
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:19,292
Kick him again,
and maybe it'll come back.

80
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,628
Tell us about your Wheeler women, Barret.

81
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:24,172
Now, are you humping
just the growed one or both?

82
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:28,216
Probably both at the same time.

83
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,013
I mean, that little one,
she's just out of knickers, ain't she?

84
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,933
Yeah. I'll bet you she's about
as juicy as a freshwater clam.

85
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,769
What does it take to get you
to fight like a man anyway?

86
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,732
- I didn't come here to fight.
- Then you shouldn't have come here at all.

87
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,820
You made a big mistake, tin pan.
You know that?

88
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,658
Mind if I take a look at your goods?

89
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:53,993
You leave them be.

90
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:56,663
Come on down off of there.

91
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:01,208
How you like that, panner?

92
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,423
God.

93
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,551
Get out of there. Get out of there.

94
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,565
Canvas, burlap and wood.

95
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:26,900
Looks like the makings for a good fire,
right?

96
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,403
Yeah.

97
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,827
You shouldn't play with matches.

98
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,258
Goddamn.

99
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,472
There's nothing like
a nice piece of hickory.

100
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,145
Much obliged.

101
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,664
Damn.

102
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:52,003
Go on.

103
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,133
Hey... Hey, there.

104
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,970
Hey, there, Hull Barret's my name.

105
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,638
- You from hereabouts?
- Nope.

106
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,351
- Are you just passing through?
- I hadn't really thought about it.

107
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,980
After what you did back there,
I wouldn't stay in town if I were you.

108
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:12,232
My cabin has two rooms.
You're welcome to one of them, if you like.

109
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,569
I wouldn't wanna be a burden
on you or your family.

110
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:19,365
Well, all I got is a
kind of fiancÃ©e, is all.

111
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,951
But it'd be a pleasure, not a burden.

112
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,247
Three hots and a cot,
it's the least I owe you.

113
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,182
- So long, Hull.
- Where you going, Ulrik?

114
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,099
Going. Getting out.

115
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,727
Where the hell to?

116
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,688
Away. Can't fight no more.

117
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,356
I'm not the only one either.

118
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,944
Good luck, Hull Barret.
You'll quit too, if you're smart.

119
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,369
Come on, Wilson. Come on.

120
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,377
"And power was given to him that sat
thereon to take peace from the earth..."

121
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:19,217
and that they should kill one another.
There was given unto him a great sword.

122
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,429
And when he had opened the third seal, I
heard the third beast say, 'Come and see."'

123
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:27,849
Very good.
Fetch me some butter and some syrup.

124
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,771
"And I beheld, and lo, a black horse..."

125
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,734
and he that sat on him had a pair of
balances in his hand. And I heard a voice...

126
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,572
in the midst of the four beasts say,
'A measure of wheat for a penny...

127
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,032
and three measures of barley
for a penny...

128
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,744
and see thou hurt not
the oil and the wine.'

129
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,874
And when he had opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth beast say:

130
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,335
'Come and see.' And I looked...

131
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:58,463
and behold a pale horse,
and his name that sat on him...

132
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,465
was Death...

133
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,855
"...and hell followed with him."

134
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,746
Here's a towel for you.

135
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:44,175
Dinner will be ready pretty soon.

136
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,991
The way he waded into McGill and
his men, you should have seen him.

137
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,953
Well, he sounds no different than McGill
or Tyson or any of LaHood's rough men.

138
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,748
At least he wasn't afraid of them.

139
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:16,334
That's what we need here,
someone they can't scare.

140
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,586
You scared of them, Hull?

141
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:22,923
Well, he should be.
But he's too all-fired stubborn.

142
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,345
But I was scared and that's the point,
they knew it. LaHood's got us all scared.

143
00:22:28,387 --> 00:22:32,223
Lindquist left and he didn't
even know where he was going.

144
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,852
"I'm just going," he said.

145
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,396
The colony is beaten, Hull.
The only one who doesn't know it is you.

146
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:42,233
And me. I'm not leaving until
LaHood's men are whipped. Every last one.

147
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,070
Hush, Megan!
Now, see what you're doing, Hull Barret?

148
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,031
You got her talking more like
your daughter than mine.

149
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,910
Tell her this is nonsense,
this business about fighting.

150
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:54,454
- Who said anything about fighting?
- You did, talking about this stranger.

151
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,955
What is he, a gunman?

152
00:22:56,124 --> 00:23:00,461
I half hope he is. I'd sure chip in
an ounce of dust for a little protection.

153
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:04,089
- From a hired killer?
- Who said he was a hired killer?

154
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,548
Megan, we're going home.

155
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,759
- Sarah, please.
- Then get rid of him.

156
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,470
- I will. I promise I'll...
- Today.

157
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:12,306
- No, right after supper.
- No, not after supper.

158
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,224
- Now!
- Sarah, he saved my life.

159
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,309
Good evening.

160
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:23,567
Hope I'm not the cause
of all this excitement.

161
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:34,662
Do you mind?

162
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,957
Oh, go right ahead.

163
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,669
There's nothing like a shot of whiskey...

164
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:45,256
to whet a man's appetite.

165
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,515
Fine looking fricassee there, ma'am.

166
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:57,268
Don't want it to get cold.

167
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,270
I apologize. I mean...

168
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,230
I didn't realize...

169
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,442
I'll be damned.

170
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:07,862
Here, come right down here.

171
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,866
And I'll get you some biscuits here.
There's your stew, some butter and syrup.

172
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,326
Is there anything else you want?

173
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,872
Just some company.
Aren't you gonna join me?

174
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:21,166
- Ma? Hull?
- Well, of course.

175
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,586
Well, how do you do?

176
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:28,548
And thank you for helping
on Hull's behalf this morning.

177
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,218
I'm Sarah Wheeler.

178
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:34,430
- This is my daughter, Megan.
- Megan.

179
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:37,057
I guess we kind of
got carried away there...

180
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:40,519
but from the way you handled
those men, I never would have thought...

181
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,563
Will you say grace?

182
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,065
Certainly.

183
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:50,778
For what we are about to receive,
may we be truly thankful.

184
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,405
Amen.

185
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,909
- Amen.
- Amen.

186
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:42,080
- You should've started over an hour ago.
- I apologize, Josh.

187
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,291
We'd have been here,
but we got tied up at the sawbones'.

188
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:47,627
What the hell happened?

189
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:52,048
Well, we had a little set-in with
Barret, boss. We's in town and...

190
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,970
And you got whipped?
In LaHood, California, by a tin pan?

191
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:59,181
Well, there was a stranger
who kind of give him a hand.

192
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:03,143
- A stranger?
- A big guy.

193
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,688
Who're you talking about?

194
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,316
He left with Barret.
He didn't stick around to chat.

195
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,862
McGill, take the sluice.

196
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:18,325
- Jagou, Tyson, Elam, take over the monitor.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,592
Club?

198
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,566
This man, LaHood, I take it
he's the one you all are feuding with.

199
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:54,612
Yeah, well, him and his son.
Old Coy LaHood, he's a powerful man.

200
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:58,281
He come up here... I guess in '54 or '55,
I think it was.

201
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,701
And he was the first man
to strike it rich.

202
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:04,997
He saved himself a poke, then he'd
stake new claims and he'd mine them out...

203
00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:07,833
and then buy some more.
Last couple years...

204
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,961
- ...he's been using big hydraulic monitors.
- Oh, yeah.

205
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:15,048
They blast a place to hell.
Excuse my French.

206
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:16,842
- Morning, Meg.
- Hello.

207
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,054
- Good morning.
- LaHood's more powerful now than ever.

208
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,222
But Carbon Canyon's the only place
his crew hasn't ruined yet.

209
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,224
He's greedy for it too.

210
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,769
Does he have any lawful rights
to your canyon here?

211
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:32,441
Oh, no. My claim is filed in Sacramento.
Same as everybody else's.

212
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:36,069
The only way LaHood can take
this land legally is if we leave it.

213
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:39,239
I take it he's been kind of persuasive.

214
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:42,159
I don't care if they all leave,
I'm staying here.

215
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:45,119
He killed my dog and my Grandpa.

216
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,291
Isn't there any law around,
someone you can take your case to?

217
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,046
Even if there was, LaHood would own them
like he owns everything else.

218
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:57,590
And there's not much a lawman could do
even if we had one.

219
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,801
Because LaHood,
he ain't killed anyone yet.

220
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,805
Meg's grandpa's heart gave out.

221
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:07,558
I've been sort of taking care
of Sarah and Megan ever since.

222
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,896
You know, it ain't that
we're living in sin...

223
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,775
and it ain't that
I don't wanna marry her.

224
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:18,112
It's just that, one day
a few years back, her husband...

225
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:20,489
Megan's father, he lit out on her...

226
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,784
and left her with a half-growed child.

227
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,621
Since then, getting her trustful
of a man has been...

228
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:30,874
Well, you know, it ain't been easy.

229
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,961
But when we get hitched,
how about you doing the hitching?

230
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:41,134
If you're waiting for a woman to make up
her mind, you may have a long wait.

231
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,930
Yeah, I guess so.

232
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:48,726
Meantime, why don't you put me to work?

233
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,019
Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to...

234
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:53,814
Well, I mean, maybe if
there was something spiritual.

235
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:58,443
Well, spirit ain't worth spit without
a little exercise. Now, you tell me where.

236
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,695
Yeah? Well, okay.

237
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:05,116
You know, I always thought that
if I could split that rock there...

238
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,618
and get to the gravel underneath...

239
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,248
there's gold been waiting
since the beginning of time.

240
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:16,836
Now, every morning for two years,
I've been coming out here, and you see...

241
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:22,509
it's like this rock and me,
we have a kind of agreement.

242
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:25,846
I'm gonna do it in
or it's gonna do me in.

243
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,557
Well, I'd hate to lay odds
on who's gonna win.

244
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:32,352
Yeah? Well...

245
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,690
You know, I thought of drilling it and
blasting the son of a gun, but that would...

246
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:40,318
- That would wreck the stream?
- Yeah. Dam it up, be the end of everything.

247
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:47,201
Well, there's plain few problems can't be
solved with a little sweat and hard work.

248
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,496
Hull? Mr. Preacher?

249
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:17,207
Somebody's coming.

250
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:32,806
You recognize them?

251
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:36,058
The one on the left is LaHood's boy, Josh.

252
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,103
The other one...

253
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,397
I ain't never seen him before.

254
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:45,777
Barret. Megan.

255
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,407
A friend of yours, Barret?

256
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,828
Yep. He's our new preacher.

257
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,289
Preacher?

258
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,753
I hear you messed up
some of my boys, preach.

259
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:06,173
Nothing personal.

260
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,260
I hope you won't take it personal when we tell
you to get the hell out of Carbon Canyon.

261
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,347
Well, there's a lot of sinners hereabouts.

262
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,601
You wouldn't want me to leave
before I finish my work, would you?

263
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,394
Club.

264
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:11,278
- Jesus.
- Your work done now, preacher?

265
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,660
Part of it, leastways.

266
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:39,098
All right. All right.

267
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,268
Get up.

268
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,941
Take it easy.

269
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,697
Put it in a little ice,
and that'll take care of it.

270
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,791
Thanks for stopping by, son.

271
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,771
You think you can make it?

272
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:29,148
Ice. Ice.

273
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,577
Well, now...

274
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,791
the Lord certainly does
work in mysterious ways.

275
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,838
Preacher, my ass.

276
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,637
- Hey, come on.
- Split it to hell.

277
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,496
- Good day, Mr. LaHood.
- Whitey.

278
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:09,373
- Watch that step, Mr. LaHood.
- Why?

279
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,585
Damn thing move
since we left Sacramento?

280
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,797
- Thank you, Mr. LaHood.
- Welcome home, Pop.

281
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:18,717
- Morning, son. McGill.
- Boss.

282
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,719
- How was Sacramento?
- Paradise.

283
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,429
Two politicians
for every Chinese laundry...

284
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:26,141
and two whores for every politician.

285
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:30,186
If there was gold in the delta,
I'd go there. How's business?

286
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:33,148
We're still pulling low-grade ore
out of number-five shaft...

287
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:35,108
but that vein's about played out.

288
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:39,528
We went another 20 foot down 12 shaft,
pulled nothing but manganite, shut it down.

289
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,782
And that plaster vein in Cobalt Canyon
is wearing kind of thin too.

290
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,534
What about Carbon?

291
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:48,746
Well, we ran another raid through there
a few days back.

292
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:51,041
Put a damn good scare into them,
didn't we?

293
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,045
Yeah. We damn near run them out
this time, lock, stock and barrel.

294
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:04,429
Seems a stranger sort of came through
and pulled them together.

295
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:08,599
- Ain't that the way you see it, McGill?
- Yeah, he kind of pulled them together.

296
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,268
This one stranger did that?

297
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:15,356
Hell, I expect you boys didn't
explain to him just who we are.

298
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:20,152
I expect that once you explain things
to him, he'll decide to move on.

299
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,947
Yeah, there ain't much for
a preacher to do around here.

300
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:26,617
A preacher?
You let a preacher into Carbon Canyon?

301
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:31,581
We didn't invite him.
He took up with Hull.

302
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:34,166
What the hell's wrong with
a preacher anyway?

303
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:38,003
When I left for Sacramento,
those tin pans had all but given up.

304
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,005
Their spirit was nearly broken.

305
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,842
And a man without spirit is whipped.

306
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,097
But a preacher, he could give them faith.

307
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:52,686
Shit! One ounce of faith, they'll be dug
in deeper than ticks on a hound.

308
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:58,190
You boys... You go throw a rope
around that man. You bring him to me.

309
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,777
No, don't.

310
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,699
If we get too rough, we'll make a martyr
out of him. Don't wanna give them a martyr.

311
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:09,202
- That's true.
- You didn't get no help from Sacramento?

312
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:12,496
Sacramento ain't worth moose piss!

313
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,708
They didn't sign the writ, I take it.

314
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,878
Not only that, some of them bastard...
Hold there.

315
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:24,509
Some of them bastard politicians wanna
do away with hydraulic mining altogether.

316
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,304
"Raping the land," they call it.

317
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:32,266
We gotta move on Carbon,
and move fast and dig deep.

318
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:36,896
The way the wind's blowing, in another
couple years, we may be out of business.

319
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,983
And those tin pans have gotta go.

320
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:42,360
And that preacher.

321
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,030
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.

322
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,119
Were Grandma and Grandpa happy
when you got married, Ma?

323
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,248
I'm afraid they didn't have
a thimbleful of choice in the matter.

324
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,293
Were they surprised?

325
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,755
Your grandpa took the measles,
and your grandma got drunk.

326
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,965
I suppose you could say
it surprised them some.

327
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,177
Because they thought
you weren't old enough?

328
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,512
Your grandma was 15
when she got married.

329
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:15,059
No, I think what riled them
was who I married.

330
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:18,396
Think you'll be happy married to Hull?

331
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,398
Who says I'm marrying Hull?

332
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,110
Hull's nice enough, isn't he?

333
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,197
Yes.

334
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,365
He's nice.

335
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,411
Do preachers get married?

336
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,085
I don't see why not.

337
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,588
How do I look?

338
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,010
You look lovely.

339
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,472
You are the prettiest daughter...

340
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:55,809
I could ever have.

341
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:11,074
- Break your hand there, Hull?
- It's a nugget!

342
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,659
It's the biggest damn nugget
I ever seen.

343
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:17,329
Look here. Look at that.

344
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,833
Isn't that beautiful?
That's almost as beautiful as Sarah?

345
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:25,880
Sarah! Megan! Look!

346
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:32,094
- Yeah, it figures.
- Sarah! Megan!

347
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,097
Look!

348
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,099
Hull's hit pay dirt.

349
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,940
- It come from underneath that boulder.
- He found it under the boulder.

350
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:48,360
I was right. You know, I was right.

351
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:52,949
It must weigh all of 4 ounces.
That's a quarter pound of gold. See that?

352
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,867
- Look at that.
- Is that real?

353
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,704
Real? Just look at it.

354
00:40:58,204 --> 00:41:00,206
Come here.

355
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,461
- So how about we celebrate?
- Can we go into town?

356
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I don't think that's a very good idea.

357
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,632
That would go a long way
to clearing your credit.

358
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,177
It would, at that.
It would clear it and then some.

359
00:41:13,344 --> 00:41:14,971
Can we, please?

360
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,474
- Well, what do you think?
- Why not?

361
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:21,643
We've got as much right in town
as the next person.

362
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,230
Come on.

363
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:32,237
You going to town again, Mr. Barret?

364
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:34,740
That's right. You wanna come along?

365
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,244
No, our daddy wouldn't let us go to town.

366
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,539
Sure is a nice day for it, though?

367
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,710
Have a good time.

368
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,369
I'll be right back. I'll go and
square things with Mr. Blankenship.

369
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:24,081
- Take care of the ladies.
- That won't be hard.

370
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,708
We'll get a soda after I'm done.

371
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:40,139
Look.

372
00:42:45,311 --> 00:42:48,481
- I'll go get Hull.
- That's all right.

373
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,567
He'll be fine.

374
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,492
Mrs. Wheeler, Megan.

375
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,077
My papa wants to see you, preacher.

376
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,163
He does, does he?

377
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,791
All right.

378
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,130
- Don't go. I know it's a trick.
- I'll be all right.

379
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,215
Good day.

380
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,682
- What if they hurt him?
- Shut up, Megan.

381
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:27,686
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

382
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,688
It's all right.

383
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:42,909
Preacher, my name is Coy LaHood.

384
00:43:43,077 --> 00:43:44,621
I know.

385
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,376
Do you imbibe, Reverend?

386
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,211
Only after 9 in the morning.

387
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,550
When I heard a parson
had come to town...

388
00:43:57,717 --> 00:44:03,014
I had an image of a pale, scrawny,
Bible-thumping Easterner...

389
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:07,393
- ...with a linen handkerchief and bad lungs.
- That's me.

390
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,481
Hardly.

391
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:13,815
Your health, sir.

392
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,737
You know, it occurred to me
it must be difficult for a man of faith...

393
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:22,115
to carry the message
on an empty stomach, so to speak.

394
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:28,164
So I thought, why not invite this devout
and humble man to preach in town?

395
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:32,418
Why not let the town be his parish?
In fact...

396
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,920
why not build him a brand-new church?

397
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,885
I can see where a preacher'd be
mighty tempted by an offer like that.

398
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,596
Oh, indeed.

399
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,351
First thing you know, he'd be thinking about
getting himself a batch of new clothes.

400
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,228
Why, we'd have them tailor-made.

401
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,273
Then he'd start thinking
about those Sunday collections.

402
00:44:55,733 --> 00:45:00,445
Well, hell, in a town as rich as LaHood,
that preacher, he'd be a wealthy man.

403
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:02,407
That's why it wouldn't work.

404
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,954
Can't serve God and mammon both.
Mammon being money.

405
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,300
I opened this country.

406
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,806
I made this town what it is.
I brought jobs and industry.

407
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,434
I built an empire with my own two hands.

408
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:33,771
And I've never asked help of anyone.

409
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:39,235
Those squatters, Reverend,
are standing in the way of progress.

410
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:41,070
Theirs or yours?

411
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:48,161
Here, look, look. Just look at that writ!
Comes hot from Sacramento...

412
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:51,664
and it tells me I've got mineral rights
to that whole damn canyon.

413
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,043
Well, that hardly seems likely. If you had
those rights, you'd have exercised them.

414
00:45:57,211 --> 00:46:02,090
No, I think those people have legal claims.
You can't mine that canyon until they leave.

415
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,135
Damn it! Come on, read that writ!

416
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:08,181
If it was worth the paper it was printed
on, you wouldn't be trying to bribe me.

417
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,192
What's your business
with those tin pans, Reverend?

418
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,527
Nothing. They're just friends.

419
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:28,201
Well, you and your friends
got 24 hours to pack up and leave...

420
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:31,369
or my men will ride through
that canyon and run you out.

421
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,123
I've been a law-abiding man,
but now I'm out of patience.

422
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,210
And any blood gets spilt
will be on your hands.

423
00:46:54,268 --> 00:46:57,813
You're a troublemaker, stranger.

424
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:02,693
You spell "bad cess" in letters
that stretch from here to Seattle.

425
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,742
Thanks for the drink.

426
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,996
Preacher...

427
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:17,958
I mean, I've reasoned with you
and bargained with you...

428
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,751
and I've come up short.

429
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,922
What's mine is mine,
and if you make me fight for it, I will.

430
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,592
There's a man, a marshal.

431
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,597
He keeps the peace, if you take
my meaning. His name is Stockburn...

432
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,643
and he won't be as patient as me.

433
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,731
These people in Carbon Canyon...

434
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,110
would you be willing to
pay cash for their claims?

435
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:45,360
Buy them out?

436
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:51,534
Well, hell, I'd do anything to prevent
bloodshed. How about $100 a head?

437
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,202
How about 1000?

438
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,713
I'll tell you what. I'll come up to 125.

439
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,802
Stockburn and his deputies
will cost you a lot more than that.

440
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,222
How would you know?

441
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:17,476
How much is it worth
to have a clear conscience?

442
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,318
A thousand dollars per claim, then.

443
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,112
But I want them out of here in 24 hours!

444
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:37,496
I paid off all accounts in full, Sarah.
I even had enough to pay off Spider's.

445
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,750
Where is he?

446
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,168
In there.

447
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:48,465
Well, do something, Hull!

448
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,077
What were you doing in there?

449
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,704
LaHood was buying me a drink.

450
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,873
Thanks for the thought.

451
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,083
So we all vote in favor?

452
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,460
- Yeah.
- Say "aye."

453
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,711
- Speak up. All those in favor?
- Aye.

454
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,213
Are any opposed?

455
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,382
Me, dang it.

456
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:37,264
Me and Coy LaHood seen a lot of ground
together, starting back in '55.

457
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:40,059
He may be greedy, but he ain't no fool.

458
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,605
If he's willing to cough up $1000 a claim,
it's because it's worth five times that.

459
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,733
The way LaHood works, maybe it is.
The way we work...

460
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,902
we're lucky to see $1000 a year.

461
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,699
- I say we take his offer.
- Yeah.

462
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,286
Suppose you struck 1000 bucks
in nuggets.

463
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,873
Would you quit and blow town?
Or keep digging?

464
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:12,257
What do you say, preacher?

465
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,971
What I say doesn't matter.
It's your sweat he's buying.

466
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,557
Why don't you sleep on it,
make the decision in the morning?

467
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:25,855
What if we don't decide in the morning?
What happens if we can't decide?

468
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,775
Well, then I suppose
LaHood'll take that as no.

469
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,568
And then what?

470
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,487
He said he'd call in a marshal.

471
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,574
What kind of threat is that?

472
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,577
- We have nothing to fear from the law.
- Law abiding.

473
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,621
This is no ordinary kind of marshal.

474
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:46,916
His name is Stockburn.
He travels with six deputies.

475
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,295
And they uphold whatever law
pays them the most.

476
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:54,090
Killing is a way of life with them.
I'm telling you this...

477
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,844
because in case you decide against
LaHood's offer, you're gonna meet him.

478
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,806
You know this Stockburn?

479
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:04,893
I've heard of him.

480
00:51:07,146 --> 00:51:08,313
I don't know.

481
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:11,733
Well, we all know what we're up against.

482
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,572
LaHood ain't just saying, "Take my offer."
He's saying, "Take my offer or else..."

483
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:19,909
We're family men, Hull.
We're no match for seven guns.

484
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,913
Yeah, but how many of us are there?
Twenty?

485
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:28,333
I heard the preacher.
I know these men are professionals.

486
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,628
But it's still 20 against seven, ain't it?

487
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,507
And we know how to pull
a damn trigger, don't we?

488
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,425
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we do.

489
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:42,847
Look, if it comes down to it, I'm willing
to fight before I'll quit my claim...

490
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,266
but, damn it, LaHood's offer's fair.

491
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:49,230
I still vote that we take his money
and we start afresh somewhere else.

492
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:53,275
Oh, starting fresh always sounds good
when you're in trouble...

493
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,112
but before we vote to pack up
and leave...

494
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,989
I think we ought to ask ourselves
why we're here.

495
00:52:00,157 --> 00:52:04,494
Because if it's no more than money,
then we're no better than LaHood himself.

496
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,789
Spider here asked a question.

497
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:12,628
If any one of us turned up $1000 worth
of nuggets, would he quit? Hell, no!

498
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,380
He'd build his family a better house...

499
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:18,884
and buy his kids better clothes...

500
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:21,554
maybe build a school...

501
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,889
or a church.

502
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:27,643
I mean, if we were farmers,
we'd be planting crops.

503
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,728
If we raised cattle, we'd be tending them.
But we're miners...

504
00:52:30,896 --> 00:52:32,690
so we dig and pan...

505
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,067
and break our backs for gold.

506
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:40,239
But gold ain't what we're about.
It ain't what I'm about.

507
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:44,869
I came out here to raise a family.
This is my home.

508
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:48,581
This is my dream. I've sunk roots here.

509
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:55,170
Now, we all have buried members
of our families in this ground.

510
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,548
And this is their dream too,
and they died for it.

511
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:03,219
Now we're gonna take $1000
and leave their graves untended?

512
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,764
We owe them more than that, don't we?

513
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,101
We owe ourselves more.

514
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:12,938
Because if we sell out now...

515
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,110
what price do we put
on our dignity next time?

516
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:21,947
Two thousand dollars?

517
00:53:24,074 --> 00:53:25,742
Less?

518
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:30,956
Or just the best offer?

519
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,923
I say to hell with LaHood.

520
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,052
- Yeah.
- I'm with you.

521
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,554
- We stay.
- I...

522
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:49,266
I ain't a brave man,
but I ain't no coward neither.

523
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:53,228
We took our chances this far.
I vote we keep it up.

524
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,648
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

525
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,483
To hell with LaHood.

526
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,775
Let them come.

527
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,027
We're ready.

528
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,365
- To hell with him.
- Yeah.

529
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,503
We'll stand together.

530
00:54:20,172 --> 00:54:21,965
See you in the morning.

531
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,300
I'm gonna turn in now.

532
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,847
That's it for me.

533
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,036
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,416
I buried my dog over here.

535
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,050
Well, that's hallowed ground, then.

536
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,802
I said a prayer for her.

537
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:10,139
It was after the raid.

538
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,726
I prayed for a miracle.

539
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,894
Well, maybe someday
you'll get that miracle.

540
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,858
It was the day you arrived.

541
00:55:29,074 --> 00:55:30,826
I think I love you.

542
00:55:33,954 --> 00:55:36,164
There's nothing wrong with that.

543
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,751
If there was more love in the world...

544
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:42,963
there'd probably be a lot less dying.

545
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,929
Then there can't be anything wrong
with making love either.

546
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:01,398
I think it's best just to...

547
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:05,235
practice loving for a while
before you think about the other.

548
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:12,409
If I practice just loving for a while,
will you teach me the other?

549
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,998
Megan, most folks around...

550
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,710
kind of associate that with marriage.

551
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,672
I'll be 15 next month.

552
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:30,135
Mama was married when she was 15.

553
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:34,556
Will you teach me then?

554
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,983
Ninety-nine out of 100 men'd
be proud to say yes to that, Megan.

555
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:49,780
But a young girl, a young woman like you...

556
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:54,659
you wouldn't wanna spend your future
on a man like me.

557
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,746
Why not?

558
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,164
That's just the way it is.

559
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,835
I don't understand.

560
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:05,878
I don't believe you.

561
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,673
I don't wanna believe you.

562
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,179
Whatever you're saying, it isn't true.

563
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,972
It isn't fair.

564
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:19,226
Come on now.

565
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:23,021
That's no way to pass a test.

566
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:27,943
Test?

567
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:30,237
Trust.

568
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,780
If you love someone...

569
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:34,992
you gotta try to...

570
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:37,869
trust what they tell you is true.

571
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,206
Even if it means they can't be together?

572
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:46,503
Someday a young man's gonna
come along, the right man.

573
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,048
Then none of this'll matter anymore.

574
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,849
Now, if I was your mama,
I'd be worried about where you are.

575
00:58:01,351 --> 00:58:04,188
It's my mama you love, isn't it?

576
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:08,942
Your mama's a fine woman,
and so are you.

577
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:14,655
The way you look at her
and the way she looks at you...

578
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,367
It's true. I don't care. You can have her.

579
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:22,246
- I never wanna see you again.
- Megan.

580
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:25,918
I hope you die and I hope you go to hell.

581
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,963
Tell your father they turned him down.

582
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:08,019
- McGill. You're just in time for the mail.
- Hell with the mail.

583
01:00:08,186 --> 01:00:11,356
The boss wants this telegram sent
right now.

584
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,692
All right.

585
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,615
Preacher?

586
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,721
He's gone.

587
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,266
What? Who?

588
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:32,019
The preacher. Packed up and left.

589
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,521
But why?

590
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:36,358
Where to?

591
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:39,277
I don't know.
He must have left before sunup.

592
01:01:42,322 --> 01:01:43,864
Well...

593
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:48,286
He must have gone to tell LaHood
about the vote last night.

594
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:51,914
With his bedroll and coat?

595
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,710
Well, I can't believe that he's gone.

596
01:01:56,253 --> 01:02:00,465
I mean, it's not like him.
He would have said something to us.

597
01:02:00,632 --> 01:02:03,592
Well, I reckon we'll survive.

598
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,806
All this talk about fighting,
no wonder he's gone.

599
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:10,766
What's that supposed to mean?

600
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:14,980
LaHood and Marshal Stockburn be damned!
Isn't that what you decided last night?

601
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:17,648
I spoke my mind, if that's what you mean.

602
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,943
You got the rest of them
to vote your way, didn't you?

603
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,487
They voted their conscience.

604
01:02:23,655 --> 01:02:25,407
They voted to fight!

605
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:28,492
Damn right! If that's what it comes to.

606
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:32,664
You think they'd have voted that way
before the preacher came?

607
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:35,083
Or if they knew he wouldn't be here?

608
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,170
- They voted to stick together.
- The preacher was holding them together.

609
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,338
They knew he helped you in town.

610
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:46,510
They watched him stand up
to that animal LaHood sent out here!

611
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,514
They were counting on him
to beat LaHood himself!

612
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:58,023
I reckon I did all right by you
before he came. Didn't I?

613
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,101
Damned if that don't cut it.

614
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,043
LaHood dammed up the creek.

615
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:05,965
If you'd accepted LaHood's offer,
this never would have happened.

616
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:23,190
Ten, 20...

617
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,775
and 30.

618
01:04:25,277 --> 01:04:28,112
Thank you, Miss Halper.
Come back and see us.

619
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:32,032
Reverend. What can I do for you?

620
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,664
There you are.

621
01:05:01,271 --> 01:05:04,690
Well, I reckon it's time to pack up
the missis and light out of here.

622
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:07,568
Sure don't seem like we got much choice.

623
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,949
How about you, Barret? Any ideas?

624
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:19,623
Where's the preacher?
He'll know what to do.

625
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,498
He ain't here.

626
01:05:25,128 --> 01:05:28,882
- You mean he's gone?
- He...

627
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,592
He went to tell LaHood
that we turned him down.

628
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:35,012
But before he left...

629
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:40,601
he said that if anything happened,
that he hoped we'd do like he'd do...

630
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:41,936
if he was here.

631
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,193
Shit.

632
01:05:52,197 --> 01:05:54,114
I don't know.

633
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,036
I suppose we could dry-pan
for a couple days, come to think of it.

634
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,956
I know he'd hate to see us quit,
without we gave it our best.

635
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:07,003
Let's play it out a couple days.
What can we lose?

636
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:14,219
One nugget. I'd like to find me
one big nugget.

637
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:18,514
I'd shove it so far up LaHood's ass,
it'd wink at him when he washes his teeth.

638
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:47,085
You got sand, Barret...

639
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,753
but you can't lie worth a damn.

640
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:54,259
With the preacher gone and LaHood on
the warpath, your life won't be worth spit.

641
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,594
If I was you,
I'd pack them two ladies and git.

642
01:07:48,646 --> 01:07:50,315
Hull?

643
01:07:52,275 --> 01:07:53,650
What?

644
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,570
You angry at me?

645
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,324
No. Whatever gave you that notion?

646
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,784
You angry at Mama, then?

647
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,246
Well, I wouldn't say that. Not angry.

648
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:11,335
She hurt your feelings, didn't she?
I know how that feels.

649
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:13,922
Yeah, well...

650
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,507
let's talk about it later?

651
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:20,345
Hull, can I borrow the mare?

652
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,847
Can you saddle her?

653
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,850
I already did.

654
01:08:26,351 --> 01:08:28,478
Sure, take her out for a stretch.

655
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:51,542
Rich, by Christ!

656
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,045
Sweet Holy Ghost, I've struck it rich!

657
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:01,426
Gossage, look at this!

658
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,054
Henderson!

659
01:09:05,765 --> 01:09:06,807
Rich!

660
01:09:07,225 --> 01:09:08,976
Look at this!

661
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,899
Eddie! Teddy.

662
01:09:15,525 --> 01:09:17,193
You pair of clodpolls.

663
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,195
Come see what your daddy
pulled out of the stream.

664
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,618
LaHood!

665
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:29,831
You sugar-legged toad, I beat you!

666
01:09:29,998 --> 01:09:33,376
Look at this! Old Spider's struck it rich.

667
01:09:33,543 --> 01:09:35,920
- What you got there, Daddy?
- What's it look like...

668
01:09:36,087 --> 01:09:40,341
you brainless barn owl? It's gold!

669
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:46,890
Go get the mules.

670
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:49,600
We're going to town.

671
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:54,063
- Us? We're going to town.
- We're going to town.

672
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:31,475
Sarah, I wanna apologize
if anything I've said or done...

673
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,978
is gonna stand between us.

674
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:37,564
Can't think of any such.

675
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:45,113
- Sure looks like Spider's payday come.
- Yeah.

676
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:49,743
Maybe it's just his turn,
like it was your turn a couple days ago.

677
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:53,538
Well, at least someone will leave
Carbon Canyon a few dollars richer.

678
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,707
Looks like.

679
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:58,502
When we all pack up...

680
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:03,173
there's room in my wagon for anything
you're wanting to take with you.

681
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:09,346
Are you asking us to leave here with you?

682
01:11:09,681 --> 01:11:12,641
Well, I reckon we're all going, aren't we?

683
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:17,479
Damn it, Sarah,
ever since your daddy died...

684
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,858
I've done the best I could
to help you and Megan...

685
01:11:21,025 --> 01:11:25,363
without putting any conditions on it.
I'm putting one on. You owe me the truth.

686
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:28,240
Now, what do you have against me?

687
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:33,662
- Nothing.
- Is there a chance for us being together?

688
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:42,838
You are the decentest man
I ever met, Hull Barret.

689
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,302
The answer is yes.

690
01:11:53,057 --> 01:11:56,394
- Sarah.
- Hull...

691
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:59,021
I apologize...

692
01:11:59,355 --> 01:12:03,192
for being so high-strung lately.

693
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,569
It's just that I...

694
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:08,739
I've been so confused.

695
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:12,827
With everything that's been going on,
it's a wonder we all ain't crazy.

696
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:16,831
But we've got nothing more to worry about.

697
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:20,542
We'll start all over again someplace new.

698
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,712
The three of us.

699
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:27,257
And the first town we get to,
we'll find ourselves another preacher.

700
01:12:28,092 --> 01:12:29,761
Yes.

701
01:12:34,265 --> 01:12:36,475
Another preacher.

702
01:12:55,453 --> 01:12:57,788
Come to see how the rich folks do it?

703
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:00,375
Maybe.

704
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:03,377
Your mama know where you are?

705
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:07,047
I don't tell her everything.

706
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,884
She wouldn't like it much
if she knew you were here.

707
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:14,930
I'm 15, same age as her when she
got married. I can do whatever I want.

708
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:19,351
You want me to show you around?
That is why you came here, isn't it?

709
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:27,402
Three-quarters of a mile up the stream,
we diverted half of Cobalt Creek.

710
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,238
It flows through a ditch
along the contours of the slope.

711
01:13:30,738 --> 01:13:33,658
It ends up about 100 yards up yonder.

712
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,787
- It can't just end.
- Well, it doesn't really.

713
01:13:38,704 --> 01:13:42,125
It flows into a length of 3-foot pipe...

714
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:46,087
and then that flows downslope
real steep...

715
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,840
and then that narrows
to a 2-foot pipe...

716
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:52,717
and then a 1-foot pipe. All that time,
that water's going down slow...

717
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,511
but picks up speed...

718
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,390
and it picks up force
by going into a thinner pipe.

719
01:13:57,557 --> 01:13:59,307
It hurts my ears.

720
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,479
By the time the water
reaches the monitor...

721
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:07,899
I got about 200 pounds of pressure
per square inch.

722
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,988
I could blast that gravel
out of that cliff...

723
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:16,283
then it washes down into the bed
and then it travels through the sluice.

724
01:14:17,118 --> 01:14:18,368
It looks like hell.

725
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:22,457
You know, I can get 20 tons
of gravel a day on this rig.

726
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:28,171
So, tell me, what did you
really come up here for?

727
01:14:29,547 --> 01:14:32,716
I was just riding.
Figured I'd take a look around.

728
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,219
Yeah?

729
01:14:35,386 --> 01:14:39,055
I'm wanting to take a look too. At you.

730
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,144
Real close.

731
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:58,576
Look what I got me, boys.
A tin pan's daughter.

732
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,903
No, please, stop! No!

733
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:36,154
Get up on her, Josh.

734
01:15:41,244 --> 01:15:42,286
Come on, Josh.

735
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:49,335
You got her, you got her. Come on.

736
01:15:50,753 --> 01:15:53,838
- No. No.
- Get up on her, Josh.

737
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,802
- Come on.
- Stop. Stop, please.

738
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:01,180
Stop. Stop.

739
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:44,574
LaHood!

740
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,498
It's old Spider!

741
01:17:54,293 --> 01:17:56,962
Come on out and have a drink...

742
01:17:57,213 --> 01:18:00,800
with an honest man, you skunk's butt!

743
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:04,552
Is he one of them?

744
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,805
A piece of trash.

745
01:18:07,056 --> 01:18:10,518
Named Conway. Used to work for me.

746
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:13,104
It's too bad.

747
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,398
For a while there, I had them buffaloed.

748
01:18:16,065 --> 01:18:19,275
Then this preacher come along
and shot them full of sass.

749
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:20,735
Preacher?

750
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,948
You take care of him...

751
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,283
along with the rest.

752
01:18:27,993 --> 01:18:30,371
Made me look bad in front of my men.

753
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:33,289
He whipped four of them.

754
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:38,087
- A preacher did that?
- You're damn right he did.

755
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,172
What did this preacher look like?

756
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,386
- Well, he was tall and lean.
- You're gonna pay for it.

757
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,846
His eyes...

758
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:52,810
Yeah, his eyes,
something strange about them.

759
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,023
That mean something to you?

760
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:02,862
You're gonna lose it all, Coy!

761
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,823
Sounds like a man I once knew.

762
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:11,537
Might be. He recognized your name.

763
01:19:22,256 --> 01:19:24,175
It couldn't be.

764
01:19:26,302 --> 01:19:29,262
The man I'm thinking about is dead.

765
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,515
I got you, Coy.

766
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,729
I know you're in there, Coy!

767
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:42,275
I got something to show you.

768
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:47,238
Come on out and have a drink...

769
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:50,909
you old sow belly in bloat!

770
01:19:52,578 --> 01:19:56,457
Sounds like your daddy's running out
of steam. You better take him home now.

771
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:00,002
No. Hell, Mr. Blankenship,
we only get to town here once a year.

772
01:21:06,735 --> 01:21:09,613
- Where's LaHood?
- Inside.

773
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,783
What is it you want?

774
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:17,954
You're Stockburn.

775
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:21,250
Yes.

776
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:23,293
These are my deputies.

777
01:21:25,462 --> 01:21:29,257
Gentlemen, say hello to Mr. Conway.

778
01:21:38,976 --> 01:21:42,938
I have no grief with you.
It's Coy I wanna talk to.

779
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:45,565
He's listening.

780
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:49,153
LaHood!

781
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:54,617
You creepy-legged lizard.

782
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:58,328
I don't think Mr. LaHood
wants to talk to you...

783
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,456
tin pan.

784
01:22:01,832 --> 01:22:04,877
Maybe he'd like to watch you dance.

785
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:08,421
I don't know how to dance.

786
01:22:15,095 --> 01:22:16,846
It's easy.

787
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,765
You just move your feet...

788
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:21,769
to the rhythm.

789
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:29,902
Daddy!

790
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:38,034
Stay where you are, boys!

791
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,453
Some music, gentlemen.

792
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:41,347
No!

793
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:46,353
Pop?

794
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:53,777
Take him back to Carbon Canyon.

795
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:57,405
You tell that preacher to meet me here...

796
01:23:57,614 --> 01:23:59,533
tomorrow morning.

797
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,608
Stop. Who are you?

798
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,444
You know which end of that thing
the bullet comes out of?

799
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:41,699
Preacher. You won't believe what's
happened. LaHood dammed up the stream.

800
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,993
Spider found a lump chock full of nuggets.

801
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:48,289
The Wheeler girl's horse come back
without her. Everybody's out looking.

802
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,917
I'll be damned.

803
01:25:03,847 --> 01:25:06,015
She got caught up at LaHood's,
but she's fine.

804
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:10,270
You're home now, Megan.

805
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:12,855
Your mama's here.

806
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:27,037
Preacher?

807
01:25:44,471 --> 01:25:46,390
You better come outside.

808
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:06,909
Then him and his men...

809
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,203
they shot him.

810
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:11,582
Forever.

811
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:17,253
The bullets kept hitting him forever.

812
01:26:22,342 --> 01:26:23,676
It was him, wasn't it?

813
01:26:24,595 --> 01:26:26,762
It was that marshal you warned us about.

814
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,265
Stockburn.

815
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,601
Stockburn and his deputies.

816
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:35,479
He said, "Tell the preacher
to come in the morning."

817
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:37,274
Why you?

818
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:43,697
The night you warned us about this
Stockburn, it sounded like you knew him.

819
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:46,533
Spider asked you that himself.

820
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:47,951
Is it true?

821
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,795
The vote you took the other night
showed courage.

822
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:03,175
You voted to stick together.
That's just what you should do.

823
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:07,054
Spider made a mistake.
He went into town alone.

824
01:27:08,305 --> 01:27:10,556
A man alone is easy prey.

825
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:15,311
Only by standing together are you going to
be able to beat the LaHoods of the world.

826
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:19,649
No matter what happens tomorrow,
don't you forget that.

827
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:25,322
You've got a brave man there.
Give him a decent burial.

828
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:26,989
Preacher?

829
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:33,454
You are going into town tomorrow,
ain't you?

830
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,337
How can you say that?

831
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,474
Megan feeling any better?

832
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,395
She's sleeping.

833
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,399
Thank you for what you did.

834
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:04,944
Well, there's no need.
I'm just glad I happened by.

835
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:08,614
That first day, when Hull told me...

836
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,033
what happened in town...

837
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:13,703
I knew you were a gunfighter.

838
01:28:15,998 --> 01:28:18,125
Lots of people carry guns.

839
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:23,046
Megan told me what you did
with Josh LaHood.

840
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:27,301
Who but a gunfighter
could have done such a thing?

841
01:28:30,595 --> 01:28:32,346
Would you care for some coffee?

842
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:33,890
The folk here tell me...

843
01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:38,060
that you're planning to go to town
and face that marshal and his deputies.

844
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,814
- That's right.
- Don't.

845
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,233
Please.

846
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:47,112
It's an old score and
it's time to settle it.

847
01:28:49,865 --> 01:28:54,077
I wish there was something I could
do or say to change your mind.

848
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,501
When you left the other day...

849
01:29:01,668 --> 01:29:06,088
it reminded me of a time
when someone left me.

850
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:10,926
After that, I swore
I would never be hurt again.

851
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:15,097
Or love again.

852
01:29:16,266 --> 01:29:19,519
Then you rode into our lives.

853
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:23,230
I couldn't help what I felt.

854
01:29:23,774 --> 01:29:27,277
Oh, God, I wish I could
control my feelings.

855
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,698
After you left,
I thought you'd gone for good.

856
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:36,411
It forced me to grow up...

857
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:39,122
see things differently.

858
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:43,085
Appreciate what I have.

859
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:48,506
I need a man who would never leave me.

860
01:29:48,882 --> 01:29:50,759
Can you understand that?

861
01:29:53,345 --> 01:29:56,972
And you would leave again one day,
wouldn't you?

862
01:29:58,434 --> 01:29:59,725
Yes.

863
01:30:04,481 --> 01:30:07,109
Then it's best this way.

864
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:10,362
I'm gonna marry Hull.

865
01:30:11,655 --> 01:30:15,117
- Hull is a good man.
- Yes, he is.

866
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:22,873
This is just so I won't wake up at night...

867
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,418
for the rest of my life...

868
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,046
wondering.

869
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,981
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Sarah.

870
01:30:50,444 --> 01:30:52,444
Preacher!

871
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,284
Who was that?

872
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:01,704
A voice from the past.

873
01:31:01,872 --> 01:31:03,872
Preacher!

874
01:31:11,673 --> 01:31:13,425
Sarah.

875
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:16,051
Close the door.

876
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,528
Who are you?

877
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,240
Who are you...

878
01:31:38,408 --> 01:31:40,076
really?

879
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:45,748
Well, it really doesn't matter, does it?

880
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:48,877
No.

881
01:31:55,091 --> 01:31:57,091
Preacher!

882
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,363
Good morning, Barret.

883
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:19,865
- Little early, isn't it?
- A little.

884
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:26,038
Good gun for buffalo. The problem is,
there aren't any hereabouts.

885
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:30,210
I'm going with you.

886
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:33,380
There's no buffalo where I'm going either.

887
01:32:39,177 --> 01:32:40,220
I know.

888
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:45,809
Even with that rifle,
you wouldn't stand much of a chance.

889
01:32:46,685 --> 01:32:49,311
That's for me to decide, isn't it?

890
01:32:50,981 --> 01:32:52,815
Suit yourself.

891
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,015
Oh, Jesus!

892
01:33:26,182 --> 01:33:29,476
Run, damn it! Run!

893
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,682
Yeah.

894
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:18,734
Get out!

895
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:20,819
Move it! Move it!

896
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,739
Out of my way! Let me out! Get out!

897
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,574
Get out of the way!

898
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:28,953
- Run for it!
- Move it, move it, move it.

899
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,559
What the hell are you doing?

900
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:38,648
You're a good man, Barret.
You take care of Sarah and the girl.

901
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:43,694
So long, preacher.

902
01:35:59,043 --> 01:36:02,255
I thought you were still sleeping,
and you're dressed.

903
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,550
The preacher's gone, isn't he?

904
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:08,177
Yes.

905
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,015
Did you tell him you loved him?

906
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:16,144
He knows we both love him.

907
01:36:19,355 --> 01:36:21,315
Did you say goodbye to him?

908
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,860
Yes.

909
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:30,742
I didn't.

910
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:41,377
Megan!

911
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,185
Yeah, that's him.

912
01:36:58,895 --> 01:37:01,314
That's the preacher, all right.

913
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:08,238
You ever seen him before?

914
01:37:10,073 --> 01:37:11,824
Can't see his face from here.

915
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,336
I'll be damned.

916
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,279
What's he up to?

917
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:11,676
Well, son, coffee?

918
01:38:12,302 --> 01:38:16,305
- Ma'am.
- There we are. Piping hot.

919
01:38:16,472 --> 01:38:19,975
I think you and Mr. Blankenship
ought to take a stroll.

920
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:13,820
The son of a bitch
is sitting there drinking coffee.

921
01:39:13,988 --> 01:39:16,365
He's even got his back to the door.

922
01:39:16,783 --> 01:39:18,368
Well...

923
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:22,704
I reckon all of us don't need
that marshal, do we?

924
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:47,479
It appears you won't have to bother
with the preacher.

925
01:39:56,489 --> 01:39:58,323
Are you through?

926
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:37,070
Jesus.

927
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:25,536
What the hell is he up to now?

928
01:41:26,287 --> 01:41:28,914
He's inviting us to join him.

929
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:20,882
Fan out.

930
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:22,426
Find him.

931
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:25,497
You.

932
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:33,255
You!

933
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:02,011
Long walk.

934
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:04,095
Yep.

935
01:50:47,765 --> 01:50:50,516
- Where is he?
- He's gone, Megan.

936
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:57,899
Child, he's gone.

937
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:01,278
Megan, you can't drive these horses
anymore. You'll kill them.

938
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:20,088
Preacher!

939
01:51:22,425 --> 01:51:24,092
We all love you, preacher!

940
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,766
I love you!

941
01:51:39,818 --> 01:51:41,902
Thank you.

942
01:51:44,154 --> 01:51:46,073
Goodbye.

943
01:52:15,561 --> 01:52:18,354
Come on. Come on.
