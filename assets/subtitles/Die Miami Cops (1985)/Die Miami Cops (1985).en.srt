1
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,032
Something's wrong with it.
Could you check the magazine?

2
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,076
Let's have a look at it.

3
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,476
Maybe the release is stuck.

4
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,836
I'll replace it. Won't take a minute.
Just hold on.

5
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,157
Don't move!
Don't breathe, don't hit the alarm!

6
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,992
We want guns and ammo!

7
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,514
Stay there and you won't get hurt!

8
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,914
Freeze! Make a move and you're dead!

9
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,190
You, drop your gun, slowly.

10
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,558
You, put your hands on top of your head.

11
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,673
Get down on your knees.
Down on your knees!

12
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,069
Stay!

13
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,754
And, you, get on the counter.

14
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,514
Slowly.

15
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,875
Stay.

16
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,156
Hands on top of your head.

17
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,235
Okay, fellows.
The tip paid off. I got them. Come on in.

18
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,395
<i>Roger.</i>

19
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,994
<i>Doug, your buddy Forrest
doesn't answer from Tampa.</i>

20
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,752
<i>You want me to keep on trying?</i>

21
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,353
I'll try him later.

22
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,949
-By the way, is this your first flight?
-Yes, it is.

23
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,437
A helicopter is like a woman,
a beautiful woman.

24
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,839
It's very delicate.

25
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,632
You like music?
Imagine you're dancing a waltz.

26
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,435
I feel sick.
I don't think helicopters are for me.

27
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,279
Are you sure?

28
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,669
Why not? It's so easy. Come on.

29
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,319
This is Doug Bennet.
I'm calling from New York.

30
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,595
May I speak to Steve Forrest, please?

31
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,958
He's still flying? Okay, I'll call him back.

32
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,951
-What's going on?
-He asked for it!

33
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,833
Let him go.

34
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,234
You bastard, you're worse than he is.

35
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,797
That's the only picture I have
of my friend Steve.

36
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,752
Just get rid of him.

37
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,671
I'm sorry about that, Steve.

38
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,191
Tampa Flying School. Can I help you?

39
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,715
Hi, this is Bennet again. Has he landed?

40
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,798
One moment, please.

41
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,795
Hi.

42
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,559
Who is it?

43
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,439
Come on.

44
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,791
This is Steve Forrest's answering service.
I am out right now.

45
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,279
So please leave me your name, number,
and message after the beep.

46
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,314
Very funny, Steve.

47
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,318
My favourite voice.

48
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,756
Listen, Joe Garret got out of jail yesterday.

49
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,519
Why are you calling me?

50
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,558
It's the only case we never solved
in our whole career.

51
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,950
<i>It's your career, Blue Eyes.
I resigned two years ago.</i>

52
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,278
You're not getting me back
until they give me permission...

53
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,715
to use my fists on bad guys.

54
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,433
I've got no time for Boy Scouts.

55
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,950
Listen, about Garret.

56
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,952
After he left jail,
he got in touch with someone in Miami.

57
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,508
He's on his way down there
this very minute.

58
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,477
Yeah? I got news for you.

59
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,155
Ten of my students are having tests
in the air next week...

60
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,549
and you're trying to tell me
about an old robbery.

61
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,877
Robbery? The robbery. $20 million, Steve.

62
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,870
Even if it was $200 million,
my students' tests still come first.

63
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,279
Come on, Steve.

64
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,069
Garret's on flight Eastern 181.

65
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,798
He'll land in 45 minutes.

66
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,270
That'll give you enough time
to get there and trail him. I thought--

67
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,920
You thought wrong! Over and out.

68
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,833
Keep on driving.

69
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,754
Get the wallets, the jewellery! Hurry up!

70
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,199
This money is all I've got.

71
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,272
No, there's nothing in here. Just documents.

72
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,032
Okay, stop right up here.

73
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,752
Come on, let's go.

74
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,519
All right!

75
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,472
Calm down, folks!

76
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,028
We're not far from the police station.
I'll take you there, okay?

77
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,356
-Chief?
-Come on in, Lyon.

78
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,032
One of the passengers is missing.
He must have slipped.

79
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,271
-What makes you think that, Lyon?
-His bags are there, he ain't.

80
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,399
Great thinking. Go through the bags
and see if you can come up with a name.

81
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,118
Done that already.

82
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,668
This is a release from San Quentin.

83
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,708
The guy's name is Garret.
He got out of the pen two days ago.

84
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,469
-Garret. That name mean anything to you?
-Afraid not, Captain.

85
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,949
Didn't think it would.
Joe Garret was convicted...

86
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,316
of robbing the Detroit First National Bank
of $20 million.

87
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,154
He was arrested immediately
by two real cops, friends of mine.

88
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,596
He served nine years,
and he never snitched on his accomplices.

89
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,194
I wonder what brings him to Miami
in such a hurry.

90
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,273
Sooner or later, everybody comes to Miami.
The sun's always shining.

91
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,396
Right, the sun's always shining.

92
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,316
Hey, have you got a light?

93
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,996
Why, I hardly touched you.

94
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,153
You could at least say hello to me.

95
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm sorry.
I guess I don't know my own strength.

96
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,634
-I didn't mean to hurt you.
-Bill, looks like you found some company.

97
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,473
Friend, cut the sunshine. I'm a nightbird.

98
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,194
He's dead.

99
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,273
Dead? I'm innocent!
I wanna talk to my attorney!

100
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,070
Richie, get two ambulances.
One for the hospital, one for the morgue.

101
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,997
Com. Risner just won't get off my case.

102
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,150
The minute we heard Garret was in town,
we tried to pick him up.

103
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,835
-But we missed him. Result: Garret's dead.
-Yeah, I heard.

104
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,998
We at the Bureau
are taking an interest in the case.

105
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,198
Why don't you let me handle this thing?
I can't let Risner force me into retirement.

106
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,556
You know things haven't been going well
at the station with me lately.

107
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,119
Risner likes to remind me of that.

108
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,998
As far as I'm concerned,
you're welcome to work on the case.

109
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,913
As long as you don't get in the way
of my boys.

110
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,231
I want the Bureau to work on it,
but with the agents of my choice.

111
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,915
-Who do you have in mind?
-Doug Bennet and Steve Forrest.

112
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,991
I don't know the names.

113
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,237
They're with the New York office.
Class agents.

114
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,873
A long time ago, when I was up north,
they were on the police force with me.

115
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,599
To be exact,
they're the ones that caught Garret.

116
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,272
What do you want me to do?

117
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,238
Lend me Bennet and Forrest.
They can pass as city cops.

118
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,673
Undercover?

119
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,718
Can do. I'll call the New York office today.

120
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,754
<i>Agent Bennet, the Chief wants you
in his office on the double.</i>

121
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,512
You wanted to see me, sir?

122
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,830
You interested in handling the Garret case?

123
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,117
Yes, sir. I had him trailed
from the minute he got out of jail.

124
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,998
And naturally, you asked for help
from your old buddy Forrest.

125
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,389
But because he's still upset,
he turned you down.

126
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,595
You got it, sir.

127
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,240
-In the meantime, they killed Garret.
-Right.

128
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,471
Which leads us to believe that
his accomplice and $20 million...

129
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,835
is somewhere in the Miami area.

130
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,152
Your assignment is to fly to Tampa.
Convince Forrest to work with you.

131
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,879
You'll be taking orders
from your old acquaintance...

132
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,076
Capt. Tanney of the Hialeah Police.

133
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,673
All right, sir.

134
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,313
By the way,
how are you gonna convince him?

135
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,550
I'll twist his arm a little.

136
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,393
One more step and I'll break your legs.

137
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,839
Hi, Steve. Long time no see.

138
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,031
Let's keep it that way.

139
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,915
What a way to greet your buddy.

140
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,078
Save your breath. You're wasting your time.

141
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,714
Look, Steve,
I came to ask you to come on back.

142
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,917
Are you deaf?
You're wasting your time. Go home.

143
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,270
Steve, you're gonna change your mind.

144
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,792
No way, Blue Eyes.

145
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,394
Not even if I tell you they killed...

146
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,990
our old chief, Capt. Tanney?

147
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,319
When? Who?

148
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,670
It could have been the same guys
who bumped off Garret.

149
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,230
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

150
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,634
Funny. After seven years in prison...

151
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,114
Garret comes down here
to get the $20 million.

152
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,156
Instead, he gets killed.

153
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,549
Life's strange, isn't it, Steve?

154
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,998
Charlie, isn't it exciting
getting away from New York...

155
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,310
and the constant threat of violence?

156
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,437
Keep on rolling, pal.

157
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,074
Okay, monkey face, give me the loot.

158
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,715
Wake up. He's talking to you.

159
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,673
Steve, wake up! He's talking to you!

160
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,351
Freeze. Get them up there!

161
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,111
You two up front there!

162
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,153
Don't try it!

163
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,911
Freeze! Stop!

164
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,199
Sit there.

165
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,472
Just like old times.
Back in the saddle again.

166
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,517
I'm gonna leave you my bag
and these punks to take in by yourself.

167
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,149
-Why? Where are you going?
-To visit Tanney's widow.

168
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,874
What's the hurry? We can go later.

169
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,271
Sorry, Doug, I prefer to go now.

170
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,990
-Hi, Mrs. Tanney.
-Steve.

171
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,388
There was a time when you called me Carol.
Come in.

172
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,799
Thank you.

173
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,431
I heard what happened and I...

174
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,512
Yes. Very kind of you. Thank you.

175
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,392
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

176
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,275
I'm going to miss him so much.

177
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,756
He was so sweet.

178
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,030
His loss is a real tragedy.

179
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,080
Intelligent, sensitive.

180
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,040
Yes, a real loving companion.

181
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,590
That is so true. I wrote it on his tombstone.

182
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,671
He was always so happy.

183
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,709
Happy?

184
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,959
He jumped and licked and gnawed,
pawed all over the place.

185
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,474
Jumped?

186
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,429
And he was so polite.

187
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,159
-Polite? If you say so.
-He never messed on the carpets.

188
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,433
He'd wait at the back door...

189
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,557
so he could be let out
and do it in the garden.

190
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,554
You've got an outhouse?

191
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,437
Steve, he'll be so happy to see you.

192
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,152
-See me?
-He's coming home early tonight.

193
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,192
Listen, Carol...

194
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,475
I know when these things happen
it comes as a terrible shock...

195
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,438
-but I'm a bit--
-That'll be him. Excuse me.

196
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,468
Hello? Yes, honey.

197
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,470
Not those young hoods again?

198
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,150
It was Doug? Tell him hi from me.

199
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,514
Honey, you'll never guess who's here.

200
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,556
No, it'll be a surprise.

201
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,956
You're going to be late?

202
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,558
Never mind, honey. Bye.

203
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,239
He said he'll be...
Steve? Isn't that strange.

204
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,148
Can I help?

205
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,196
-Did they take anything from you?
-No, thanks.

206
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,919
-Do you wanna file charges?
-No, thanks.

207
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,391
Can I help you, sir? Can I help you?

208
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,514
Sir, wait a minute. Where are you going?

209
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,633
Hi, Steve. What took you so long?
I was waiting for you.

210
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,948
Me, too.

211
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,559
-Steve?
-Yes.

212
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,638
Yes, what? I'm Steve. Hi, Chief.

213
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,597
-How you doing?
-All right.

214
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,638
You know,
this bastard told me you were dead.

215
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,030
Doug, you didn't have to go that far
to help me out.

216
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,157
What are you talking about?

217
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,356
Police Commissioner's giving me
a hard time.

218
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,113
If I don't solve the Garret case,
he will make me retire.

219
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,318
And after all these years on the force,
I wouldn't know what to do.

220
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,199
What can I do for you?

221
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,636
I don't have the guts to ask you,
but I really need your help.

222
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,709
He does.

223
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,439
Will you shut up? I decide for myself.

224
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,553
If I had the students' tests
postponed for a while...

225
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,710
Okay, I'll help you, Chief.

226
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,718
We're having a lot of robberies
in the north end of the city.

227
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,351
We've got a BOLO out for two white males
operating a 1984 dark blue Ford.

228
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,871
No other info on that.

229
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,669
Now I want you to meet
a couple of new cops. Stand up, fellows.

230
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,308
This is Jess Donnel and L.A. Wray.

231
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,114
Look a little grown-up to be rookies.

232
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,358
Hey, funny boy, what are you laughing at?

233
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,237
It's not his fault.
He was born that way, right?

234
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,113
"Born that way"? Yeah, that's right.

235
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,716
All right, guys, let's hit the streets.

236
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,472
You two guys wait.

237
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,717
Remember, nobody here's
supposed to know who you are.

238
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,031
Just go out on patrol, handle anything
that goes down in your sector.

239
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,317
But remember,
your main object is the Garret case.

240
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,634
Here's the keys to the address
where you'll be staying.

241
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,073
It's small but comfortable.

242
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,196
What's with this collection you've got here?

243
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,311
Terry Clay was a good cop.
He was killed about three weeks ago.

244
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,279
He was very close to getting his hands
on the expressway robbers.

245
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,033
But he had this thing for working solo.

246
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,354
-Put in $20.
-Yeah, I was going to.

247
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,993
That's yours.

248
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,158
I just put it in.

249
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,678
Put in another $20.

250
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,792
-Really?
-For me.

251
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,233
-Why don't you put it in yourself?
-Forgot my wallet. I'll pay you back later.

252
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,154
Come on, won't you ever change?
Always generous with my money.

253
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,509
I don't know how we're gonna meet tonight.
It's just impossible.

254
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,235
You know, I'm a little sore at you also.

255
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,869
That guy. What's his name?
With all those muscles?

256
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,272
I'll tell you something...

257
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,272
I bet you're here to talk about
that guy Garret in Room 5, right?

258
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,191
Right, you win the bet.

259
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,477
Hey, look here.
He registered under his own name.

260
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,039
Anyone visit him?

261
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,998
-Visit who?
-Garret.

262
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,553
Well, besides the cockroaches, no.

263
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,994
What did he do?

264
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,868
Nothing. Unless you call coming in
and going out...

265
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,396
and coming in again doing something.
You know what I mean?

266
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,789
No, we don't. You wanna tell us?

267
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,191
A guy comes in and checks in, right?
What does he do?

268
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,953
-What did Garret do?
-He goes out, he comes in.

269
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,952
He sleeps, etcetera, etcetera.

270
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,917
It's the "etceteras, etceteras"
that interests us, considering he was killed.

271
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,069
What do you know about him?

272
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,390
-You must know something.
-Not me. Listen here.

273
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,517
-He wasn't killed in this hotel.
-We know that.

274
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,353
-Did he make any calls?
-A bunch of them.

275
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,154
-Are they registered?
-No way.

276
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,074
He used the public phone over there, right?

277
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,039
-Yeah, that's right. How did you know that?
-One of my many talents.

278
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,553
Who did he talk to?

279
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,349
Listen, rule number one
in this business is you never...

280
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,519
never listen to guests' phone calls.

281
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,233
-Come on, get the key. Show us the room.
-Yes, sir, right away.

282
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,919
Pardon me.

283
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,514
This way.

284
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,953
This is Room 5.

285
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,515
What happened in here afterwards?

286
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,956
-Afterwards when?
-After they found him dead.

287
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,953
Anything you didn't connect with Garret.

288
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,952
There was one thing.

289
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,718
I don't think you'd find
that very interesting.

290
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,233
Why don't you try us?

291
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,471
After the cops left,
some guy checks in this room.

292
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,077
-Were all the other rooms full?
-That's the point.

293
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,913
There was Room 3, Room 7.

294
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,833
This guy insists on Room 5.
I mean, he insisted.

295
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,078
What else did he do?

296
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,277
He checks into the room, locks himself in...

297
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,315
and doesn't come out until the next day.
He paid and split.

298
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,989
-Weird, isn't it?
-What's so weird about it?

299
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,877
He didn't even sleep.

300
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,189
He left that room cleaner when he left
than when he first came in.

301
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,475
No kidding? Describe the guy.

302
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,478
B-l-G.

303
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,909
Big. I mean, a brute. Indian.

304
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,711
-Did he sign the register?
-Of course, silly. Sitting Bull.

305
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,999
At the time,
I thought the name was very familiar.

306
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,116
Do you happen to know him?

307
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,993
Very funny.

308
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,711
Do you remember
anything unusual about him?

309
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,749
Muscle upon muscle upon muscle.

310
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,752
Okay, we understand you like muscles.
What else?

311
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,231
Has to be an ex-fighter.
I know, I could spot one anywhere.

312
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,793
All these guys look like heavyweights to me.

313
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,189
Yeah, but our guy's a carpenter.

314
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,389
A carpenter.
What makes you think he's a carpenter?

315
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,313
He took the whole room apart
and then put it back together.

316
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,631
-He's a real pro.
-What the hell was he looking for?

317
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,790
Maybe he's a cockroach collector.

318
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,474
Chief, do you know a carpenter around here
who used to be a wrestler?

319
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,072
Freeze! Hold it!

320
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,911
Let's give him a hand.

321
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,796
-They got you mad, Sitting Bull?
-I didn't need your help.

322
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,590
I know. We need yours.

323
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,109
Why?

324
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,154
What were you doing in Garret's room?

325
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,559
Follow me.

326
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,996
I don't like to be seen
talking to Gen. Custer's boys.

327
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,594
By the way, the name's Charro.

328
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,353
Okay, Charro,
what were you doing in Garret's room?

329
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,749
You were in there for 24 hours.

330
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,594
Dismantling and putting things
back together. That's my job.

331
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,750
-What were you looking for?
-$20 million would be a good bet.

332
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,958
All the money in the world
ain't worth a damn compared to a friend.

333
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,999
Very touching.

334
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,349
Go on.

335
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,159
All I found...

336
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,076
was a screwdriver and a hammer.

337
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,714
-Maybe they didn't belong to Garret.
-Maybe.

338
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,109
Okay, what's the story
between you and him?

339
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,875
We shared a cell in San Quentin.
He saved my life once.

340
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,238
-To pay him back, you stabbed him?
-No. I read the news in the paper...

341
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,598
and decided to do a little investigating
on my own. I felt I owed him.

342
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,589
-Did you see him before he got killed?
-Yeah. He needed money.

343
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,148
Some punks ripped him off on a bus.

344
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,476
Figures. What else?

345
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,155
He said a guy who pulled the robbery
with him had to be here in Miami.

346
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,196
Garret wanted his share.

347
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,115
He knew how to get it because
he had the goods on the guy who has it.

348
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,749
Yeah, and unfortunately
the guy found him first.

349
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,798
And shut him up for good.

350
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,348
Then took the goods with him, right?

351
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,991
No, Garret was too smart.
He went to the appointment empty-handed.

352
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,316
He hid whatever he had on the guy so well...

353
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,190
even I couldn't find it.

354
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,798
Don't suppose he told you the guy's name?

355
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,955
No.

356
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,995
Okay, Charro, thanks.

357
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,268
If you think of anything else,
give us a call at this number.

358
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,312
If you find Garret's killer, let me know.

359
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,478
I have a few things I'd like to say to him.

360
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,239
Okay, Charro, you do the rest.

361
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,674
If Charro finds Garret's
killer before we do...

362
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,558
there won't be much left for the autopsy.

363
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,599
Route 31, north,
between the bridge and the gas cisterns.

364
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,990
<i>Hurry. I mean, hurry.
They're blasting at me with cannons.</i>

365
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,595
Hold them off, honey. This is Car 27.
We're on our way. Hit it.

366
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,358
Freeze! Hands up!

367
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,189
You, get up! Hands on your head!

368
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,913
Turn around, slowly.

369
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,191
Okay, down on your knees.

370
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,155
Stop.

371
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,709
You, left hand behind your back.

372
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,353
Right hand.

373
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,679
Is she okay?

374
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,273
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, thanks to you.

375
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,395
Good.

376
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,308
Not as bad as I thought.
Broken window, a few scratches.

377
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,834
Hey, congratulations. You hit the jackpot.

378
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,514
-What do you mean?
-You get the $50,000.

379
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,398
The reward from the Truckers' Association
for catching them.

380
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,833
Hey, we're rich.

381
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,753
Yeah, now you can pay me back
what you owe me.

382
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,070
I'd have paid you back anyway.

383
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,835
And apart from
the Governor's congratulations...

384
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,718
and the City's, of course, you also get this:

385
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,552
a cheque for $50,000.

386
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,278
Which, of course, you can't keep
since cops can't accept rewards.

387
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,519
Nuts, I really wanted to get a Porsche.

388
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,791
And there goes the down payment
on the new chopper.

389
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,436
We've got a better idea.

390
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,159
Now that'll take care
of the Clay kids' college.

391
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,238
Guys, we all thank you
from the 8th Precinct.

392
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,397
-Okay, it's from all of us.
-Since we can't have it.

393
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,391
Okay, you can go, guys.

394
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,716
-Jess.
-Yes, Chief.

395
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,633
You're off today.

396
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,156
But tonight, put on your best threads
and go to Club Violins.

397
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,437
You'll meet a C.I. there
who's got something on Garret for you.

398
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,999
How do we recognise him?

399
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,516
He'll recognise you. You just be there.
See you later.

400
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,350
It's gonna be tough on you.

401
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,029
Why?

402
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,157
Putting on your best threads
and looking human.

403
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,713
Speak for yourself, ET.

404
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,030
Gentlemen, what will you have?

405
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,517
I'll have a piña colada,
lots of piña, no rum.

406
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,392
Blonde Mary for me.

407
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,232
We ain't got no blonde Mary.

408
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,198
I've got a red Kitty, a brunette Barbara...

409
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,675
a black Diane, or a yellow Mingto:
a gorgeous thing, just in from Hong Kong.

410
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,193
How long have you been doing this?

411
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,272
Just fix it with tomato juice, vodka,
and pepper.

412
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,430
Oh, you mean a Bloody Mary.

413
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,630
Come on, I'm anti-violence.
What's in a name?

414
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,948
Got you.

415
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,435
We're here, where's the informer?
How come they're always late?

416
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,909
Informers? Rats is more like it.

417
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,870
Would you mind passing me
the peanuts, please?

418
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,995
Sure.

419
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,911
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

420
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,673
Not only are they always late,
they smell like a latrine.

421
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,957
That's because they're scared.
It's the adrenalin.

422
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,909
Considering the kind of work they do,
it's not surprising.

423
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,913
To our meeting.

424
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,398
As you can see, not all informers are late.

425
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,678
And they don't all smell like a latrine.

426
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,037
And as for rats, I won't even discuss it.

427
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,552
My name's Irene.

428
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,554
-Hi, I'm Jay.
-And I'm Wray.

429
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,914
To avoid suspicion, I think one of you
should ask me to dance.

430
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,833
-You, twinkle toes.
-All right.

431
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,671
-Madam, would you care to dance?
-Love to.

432
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,399
You know, I have the feeling
we've met somewhere before.

433
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,038
I don't think so.

434
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,795
You look familiar.
Were you in Boston two years ago?

435
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,835
No.

436
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,109
Funny.

437
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,033
How come an attractive woman like you
ends up in a job so...

438
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,235
Raunchy?

439
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,278
Yeah. No, I mean dangerous.

440
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,677
That's a long story.
Maybe someday I'll tell you.

441
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,308
-Hello.
-You need nuts with what you're drinking.

442
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,960
-Thank you.
-Mind if I sit down?

443
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,915
Are you kidding? On this side.

444
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,439
-Surprised to see me?
-Nothing surprises me anymore these days.

445
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,159
I was passing by and I saw you come in.

446
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,918
I'm glad you did. How's your truck?

447
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,869
Looking pretty. Between you and me,
I made a little extra on the insurance.

448
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,550
What do you mean, "between you and me"?
It's just between you and you.

449
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,598
I don't wanna know
if you're screwing your insurance.

450
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,673
-Who's the good-looking gal?
-She pushes an 18-wheeler.

451
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,190
We can't talk in front of her.

452
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,470
-I'll take care of it.
-Okay.

453
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,718
So you pump iron?

454
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,349
There you are.
I wanna introduce my friend...

455
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,714
Annabelle.

456
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,119
-Hello.
-Hi.

457
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,028
By the way, me and Annabelle
are gonna take a moonlight ride.

458
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,476
I didn't know you were such a romantic.

459
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,189
Really? There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

460
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,996
Nice meeting you, Irene.

461
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,829
-Hey, is this yours?
-Sure is.

462
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,553
You're not gonna tell me you use this
easy-to-park little compact all the time.

463
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,312
Always. Get in.

464
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,198
You'll find it's a lot more comfortable
than a Rolls-Royce.

465
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,350
-Am I gonna be safe?
-Who knows?

466
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,795
-I'll risk it.
-I've got some great tapes.

467
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,919
I hear you're interested in finding out
about a certain corpse: Garret's.

468
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,753
How did you know about it?
It's supposed to be top-secret.

469
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,877
-The ways of the Lord--
-Are infinite, I know.

470
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,958
So, what have you got for me?

471
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,555
Garret, while he was in Miami,
met a man named Fletcher.

472
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,355
-Who's he?
-Florida's major wheeler-dealer.

473
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,436
-What's his gig?
-Gambling. Anything illegal.

474
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,710
-So how do I get to him?
-I heard through the grapevine.

475
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,315
He intends turning the Orange Bowl game
between Washington and Oklahoma...

476
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,278
-into the biggest rip-off of the year.
-How?

477
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,509
Rumour has it he intends kidnapping
the Washington quarterback, Joe Ranieri...

478
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,831
-just for the day.
-Come on, that's hard to believe.

479
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,674
Anyway, it won't cost you anything
to keep Joe Ranieri under surveillance.

480
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,876
-I've been thinking--
-Yeah, I know.

481
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,509
Foil the kidnapping, catch Fletcher,
and give him the third degree.

482
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,749
Right.

483
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,509
Then let's go for it.

484
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,553
I don't understand a single word,
but what a voice.

485
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,756
It really reaches me all over. You, too?

486
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,758
Like I told you on the phone...

487
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,912
Joe Ranieri does not ride on the bus
with the rest of the team.

488
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,037
He's superstitious.
He goes in the limo with me.

489
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,759
Okay, no problem. We're the same size.

490
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,999
-You guys got a plan for this?
-Sure.

491
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,513
Can I hear it?

492
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,434
Well, it's very simple.
If someone wants something from you...

493
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,635
the important thing is to be sure that
something is where someone can't find it.

494
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,914
Get it?

495
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,713
Mr. Fletcher...

496
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,554
this is the betting situation
up to about three minutes ago!

497
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,515
Looks like we're all gonna retire, boys.

498
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,319
Eight figures. Zero, zero, zero.

499
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,950
-They're behind us.
-Great.

500
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,391
-Go on, gun it!
-But, sir, what's going on here?

501
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,637
Come on, burn rubber.

502
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,039
You drive.

503
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,599
Move over.

504
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,952
-This is not a Ferrari.
-It is now.

505
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,192
Car 21 to Station.

506
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,352
Stand by, we're almost there.
You've got three minutes.

507
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,312
Okay, slow down.

508
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,754
Let's go.

509
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,478
All right. The play is over, you guys.

510
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,111
It's too hot to fight.

511
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,068
Hold it.

512
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,432
Here come the troops, fellows.
They'll take you to the showers.

513
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,994
Mr. Fletcher, we've gone way past
the $10-million mark.

514
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,875
<i>Before the start of the game...</i>

515
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,992
<i>there'll be a presentation
of the Robert Delmann Award...</i>

516
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,878
<i>to Joe Ranieri,
the best quarterback of the year.</i>

517
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,111
<i>And here comes Joe now.
Let's hear that applause.</i>

518
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,837
Who the hell is that?

519
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,873
Ranieri's there.

520
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,915
-Where did those guys screw it up?
-Something must've gone wrong, boss.

521
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,434
Something? You mental retard, we're ruined.

522
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,795
Something upsetting you, Mr. Fletcher?

523
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,799
Who the hell are you guys,
and what do you want?

524
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,872
-We want to talk to you.
-The rest stay here and enjoy the game.

525
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,155
It looks like Washington just scored.

526
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,795
That's bad news. Right, Mr. Fletcher?
What did Garret want from you?

527
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,713
Who's Garret? Who are you guys anyway?
I want my attorney.

528
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,997
Come on, you jackass, start thinking.
Get over there!

529
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,435
What are you doing?
I don't even know the guy!

530
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,794
We have proof that you did.

531
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,791
-I didn't know--
-You didn't know what?

532
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,917
What's the difference?
I'm not a stool pigeon. You guys are--

533
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,996
We can arrest you for illegal betting
and kidnapping.

534
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,958
They'll lock you up and throw away the key.

535
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,073
What if I talk?

536
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,039
We won't report you
for the kidnapping attempt.

537
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,873
-Right, Steve?
-Absolutely, Doug.

538
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,514
Hold on.

539
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,111
Any way you look at it, I'm clean.
I didn't know Garret.

540
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,794
And I don't know how he knew me.
Everybody knows me.

541
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,393
But he made me a crazy offer.

542
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,199
He said if I'd help him find a guy
named Ralph Duran...

543
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,272
that he thinks is in Miami now
living under a different name...

544
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,033
we could split $20 million.

545
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,875
$20 million, that's a lot of money.
But I told him to get out...

546
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,589
because I don't go for those sneaky,
dirty things, really.

547
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,590
Well, maybe not that dirty.

548
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,319
What about Ralph Duran?

549
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,392
The first time I ever heard his name...

550
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,832
was when Garret gave it to me.
That's the truth. First time.

551
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,990
Okay? Can I go now?

552
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,316
-Sure.
-Thanks a lot. I could--

553
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,236
Do we look like the kind of cops
who'd make a deal?

554
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,994
-Right, Steve?
-Absolutely, Doug.

555
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,597
Well, for once,
Fletcher appears to be telling the truth.

556
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,798
There's nothing in the file to indicate
he had anything to do with Ralph Duran.

557
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,348
But here's where the plot thickens.

558
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,030
"Ralph Duran, highly dangerous...

559
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,953
"suspected of various murders
and robberies.

560
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,079
"On March 5, 1978, his body was found
in a Detroit garbage dump...

561
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,310
"burned beyond recognition.

562
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,674
"There was no prints.

563
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,355
"The only identifiable thing
was a scorched credit card."

564
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,398
Credit card? If you ask me, I smell a rat.

565
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,116
-Yeah. A crook with credit cards?
-Right.

566
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,199
Wait a minute.

567
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,269
The robbery took place on March 1, 1978.

568
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,752
We arrested Garret two days later.
You remember that?

569
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,398
Sure, March 3.

570
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,274
And then Duran's body
was found on March 5.

571
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,798
With his record,
he could have been in with Garret.

572
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,991
Remember, the witnesses said
that there were three robbers.

573
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,350
Duran's dead. Garret's dead.

574
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,271
Number three is your man.

575
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,916
Yeah, but why would Garret
be looking for a stiff?

576
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,228
It doesn't make sense.

577
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,154
It don't make sense with me, either.
So you handle it, Blue Eyes.

578
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,279
I would've been better off
if I'd stayed with my flying classes.

579
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,669
Three, four, five...

580
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,632
six... It's open.

581
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,669
Hi.

582
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,797
-Hi.
-I'm early, huh?

583
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,759
No, I always do 100 lifts before dinner.
Builds up my appetite.

584
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,673
Pour yourself a drink. We can eat anytime.

585
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,357
-I'll take a fast shower and be right back.
-Okay.

586
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,995
Smells great. I'm starving.

587
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,357
-If you came here to eat and run--
-Of course not.

588
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,670
I never run on a full stomach.

589
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,879
Listen, Irene...

590
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,634
from the very first moment I saw you--

591
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,473
Don't tell me. You fell in love with me.

592
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,838
Well, that wouldn't be too hard.

593
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,509
No. What I wanted to say is...

594
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,273
from the minute I saw you,
I felt like I'd met you before.

595
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,353
And now I know where:
the Demolition Derby in Tucson last year.

596
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,237
The Demolition Derby?

597
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,712
-Remember?
-No way.

598
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,715
No?

599
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,118
-The door.
-That's the timer. Dinner's ready.

600
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,676
The Indianapolis 500?

601
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,432
I haven't been there in 10 years.
It'll come back to you sooner or later.

602
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,831
Hey, you're pretty good.

603
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,070
You bet. I'm gonna get you.

604
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,471
You're the first man to beat me
at arm wrestling.

605
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,513
Well, you're tougher than Mighty Mouse.

606
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,519
You can't imagine
how important that is to me.

607
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,068
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Squeeze me.

608
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,077
-Squeeze me tight.
-What?

609
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,515
-Squeeze me tight.
-Like so?

610
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,397
No. Tighter.

611
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,755
-Tighter.
-You know I could break you in two?

612
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,796
No, you won't. I love it.

613
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,799
Excuse me.

614
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,997
<i>Steve, a guy named Charro called
looking for you.</i>

615
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,358
<i>He wants you to call him back
at this number: 473-8329.</i>

616
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,788
<i>I checked it out.</i>

617
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,872
<i>It's a public phone booth
in the Miccosukee district.</i>

618
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,157
473-8329. Yeah, I got it.

619
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,349
Yes, hi to you, too, paleface.
Something's just come up.

620
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,395
Maybe it's important, maybe it's not.
I'll be waiting for you.

621
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,919
Here's to you.

622
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,388
Which me: the informer or the cook?

623
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,511
-All of you.
-Thank you.

624
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,714
Why don't you tell me all the places
you've been in the last two years?

625
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,075
Well, I spent a year in Philly.

626
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,038
That's it. Philadelphia.

627
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,589
I've never been to Philadelphia.

628
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,753
-Don't answer it.
-It might be important.

629
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,398
I know who it is.

630
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,559
Answer it.

631
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,472
Yes, right away. It's for you.

632
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,312
<i>-It's that pain.
-Jack.</i>

633
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,789
That's you.

634
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,193
The other day, shortly after you left...

635
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,954
I received this. It's from Garret.

636
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,029
"The eagle assures your future."

637
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,472
What does that mean?

638
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,869
I thought about it for three days.

639
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,712
One thing's for sure.

640
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,634
The letter, the screwdriver, and the hammer
are all connected.

641
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,149
"The eagle assures your future."

642
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,313
I don't get it.

643
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,436
When we do get it,
we'll have the key to the mystery.

644
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,877
When you saw Garret alive,
you don't think maybe...

645
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,154
No way.

646
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,434
Here, take them. They are the clues.

647
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,392
And another thing.

648
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,556
Garret said the guy he was looking for
had a face-lift.

649
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,590
Come on, the guy he was looking for
died seven years ago.

650
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,514
There's an old Indian saying:
"Not all the dead are buried underground."

651
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,669
Sure.

652
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,797
Some get buried at sea,
some get burned up.

653
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,479
Burned up.

654
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,593
Yeah, burned.

655
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,035
Hey, wait a minute.

656
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,994
Coming.

657
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,552
-Who is it?
-It's me.

658
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,270
-Hi.
-I'm glad you could come back.

659
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,835
Sorry, but I need the names
of all the plastic surgeons...

660
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,673
who worked in Florida from '77 to '78.

661
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,433
-Now?
-Yes.

662
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,354
But it's midnight.
I can't wake up my contacts.

663
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,556
-Please.
-All right.

664
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,911
Hey, Detroit.

665
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,673
A Formula One race in Detroit, right?

666
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,189
Never been there. Hello?

667
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,239
It's got to be Danaisser.
He worked on a lot of criminals.

668
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,357
And he died on March 30, 1978.

669
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,308
Right. That's 25 days
after Ralph Duran died.

670
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,994
And that's enough time
for scars to heal, right?

671
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,868
What's with this saying "right" all the time?
Ain't you sure?

672
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,669
So it figures then that
Ralph Duran had the operation on his face...

673
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,352
-and then killed the surgeon.
-Right.

674
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,431
There you go with that word again.

675
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,876
You know something? I get the feeling
this is a job for gravediggers...

676
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,359
not for cops.

677
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,713
-We keep coming up with corpses.
-Right.

678
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,311
It's an animal clinic.

679
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,711
Maybe he practiced his craft
on delinquent Dobermans.

680
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,156
Could be. Personally,
all Dobermans look alike to me.

681
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,918
All bite no bark.

682
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,029
Mrs. Danaisser?

683
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,078
What do you cops want?
You wanna check my license?

684
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,197
No, we just wanna ask you a few questions
about your husband.

685
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,477
-My husband's been dead for seven years.
-We know that, ma'am.

686
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,994
We're interested in the circumstances
of his death.

687
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,435
There's a coroner's report.
He was hit by a truck.

688
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,988
If you'll excuse me,
I've a dog who's getting an IV...

689
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,957
and I have no assistants. Goodbye.

690
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,794
-Hey, want a hand?
-Yeah. We're trained paramedics.

691
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,594
Okay, Bounty, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

692
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,319
I'll take that out of there right now.

693
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,951
If you wanna help me, you can go out
and feed the dogs and goats.

694
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,794
The dogs' food's in the yellow pail,
the goats' food's in the green pail.

695
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,838
Sure. I'll feed the dogs, you feed the goats.

696
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,956
No, you feed the goats.

697
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,315
I'll feed the goats, all right.

698
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,954
There, now you're gonna feel much better.

699
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,032
These are all stray animals
abandoned on the streets.

700
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,749
Of course, someone who doesn't love
animals is capable of anything.

701
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,274
-Like your husband's killer.
-What do you know?

702
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,272
To tell you the truth,
we don't really know anything.

703
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,397
But we think the truck that hit your husband
did it deliberately.

704
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,471
We want to reopen the case.

705
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,518
-Seriously?
-Why do you think we're here?

706
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,828
But who could it have been?

707
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,354
Theoretically, all your husband's patients...

708
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,159
could've had an interest
in getting rid of a witness.

709
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,434
That's true.

710
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,717
Do you remember the last client
he did surgery on?

711
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,669
How could I forget? Come with me.

712
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,470
He paid so well,
we took a long vacation in Europe:

713
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,190
London, Paris, Madrid.

714
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,350
-Almost a month?
-Yes.

715
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,320
And when you got back to Miami,
the accident happened?

716
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,550
Exactly. Two days later.

717
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,389
Did your husband keep files
on his patients?

718
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,472
No. But I have
all of Mel's appointment books.

719
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,993
-Here, this is the one, 1978.
-Thanks.

720
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,952
You know, these operations were illegal.
No names, no receipts.

721
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,358
Here we are. March.

722
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,594
Look at this: "R.D."

723
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,592
Ten'll get you a hundred that's Ralph Duran.

724
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,113
Ma'am, what's this "F.T." after the $75,000?

725
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,758
It was a code my husband used...

726
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,037
when the operation
called for a total physiognomy.

727
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,712
Here you are, ma'am.
Thanks for letting us feed the animals.

728
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,268
You think you can catch the killer?

729
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,476
Our record's pretty good, ma'am.

730
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,309
"R.D."

731
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,234
I bet you're thinking
the same thing I'm thinking.

732
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,035
Maybe Delmann's actually Duran.

733
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,713
Give him a tip.

734
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,959
Thanks a lot, mister. Have a nice day.

735
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,111
Are you guys out of your minds?

736
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,998
Delmann is probably
the most important man in this city.

737
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,275
He's a political heavyweight.

738
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,076
He heads the Consolidated Realty
and he's a big shot over at the country club.

739
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,789
What about his initials?
R.D. One hell of a coincidence.

740
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,152
Come on, Steve,
millions of people have those same initials.

741
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,993
Where does this money come from?
What's his story?

742
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,435
Pretty simple.
He was expatriated out of Cuba...

743
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,318
like a lot of other people,
to get away from Castro.

744
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,312
-When?
-About seven years ago.

745
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,632
But he's loaded.
He made a lot of money on the stock market.

746
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,553
Could you get us the exact date
he got here?

747
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,877
April 2, 1978.

748
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,953
A month after Ralph Duran's body
was found.

749
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,676
Coincidence number two.
Number one: the initials.

750
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,558
Number two: the date of arrival in Miami.

751
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,560
Just three days
after that plastic surgeon died.

752
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,551
And that's coincidence number three.

753
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,437
Oh, come on, you guys.

754
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,989
Okay, forget it.

755
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,592
We haven't got a hope in hell
of getting in there.

756
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,828
All we need
are some of Delmann's fingerprints...

757
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,797
to compare with Duran's.

758
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,949
Good thinking.

759
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,510
It's the only way to prove our theory,
once and for all.

760
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,559
Hey, didn't Tanney say
Delmann's chairman of the Golf Club?

761
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,829
Yeah.

762
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,195
His locker's gotta be loaded
with his fingerprints.

763
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,713
That's right.

764
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,233
Hey, Doug.

765
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,475
The comb.

766
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,838
-Relax, you don't have a hair out of place.
-No, I had Delmann's comb.

767
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,079
Do we have any aspirin in the patrol car?

768
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,875
Hello?

769
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,794
Speaking.

770
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,874
A comb?

771
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,189
I see.

772
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,398
Are you sure they didn't take anything else?

773
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,115
I don't like it.

774
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,998
This time, those two
are too close for comfort, understand?

775
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,512
-Hey, sir, orange juice.
-Make it two.

776
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,795
We're getting close to cracking this case...

777
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,713
and here we are,
cruising around in a patrol car.

778
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,678
We're wasting our time. Let's do something.

779
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,429
Kick off by paying for the juice.

780
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,512
Look, I forgot my wallet again.

781
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,877
Will you take care of this
and I'll pay you back?

782
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,150
He forgot his wallet again.

783
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,679
You're lucky it's me and not a mugger.

784
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,910
Come on, tightwad, let's go.

785
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,357
Hey! Help.

786
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,795
You come back here with my bag!

787
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,714
Lucky.

788
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,516
Mister, was that your car?

789
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,229
Beat it before the cops get here.

790
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,351
The man said beat it!

791
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,832
I just can't believe it.

792
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,990
Delmann might be capable of a lot of things.

793
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,389
But we're talking
about attempted murder here.

794
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,597
If Delmann's our man,
that's right up his alley.

795
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,076
I think he's writing us a letter.

796
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,276
Let's forget about the initials for now.

797
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,555
But not the way
he just turned up in the city.

798
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,868
And now a bomb...

799
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,873
put in our car the day after
we tried to lift his fingerprints.

800
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,074
But how does Delmann know
you want his fingerprints?

801
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,516
Well, some guy almost killed me
to get his comb back.

802
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,873
Listen, Chief, we need a search warrant.

803
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,636
If you give us that,
we'll give you Duran on a platter.

804
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,798
No, guys. It's too big.

805
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,270
If you blow it, we're dead.

806
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,318
What if we come up with proof
that will nail him?

807
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,628
Such as?

808
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,238
Check the computer
and see if anybody at the Golf Club...

809
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,118
reported an attempted robbery last night.

810
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,072
No, it's a negative report.

811
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,355
Don't you think that's funny?

812
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,194
Well, Tom?

813
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,238
God help us all,
I wanna make one thing perfectly clear.

814
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,038
I'm not giving you a search warrant.

815
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,395
You can work it
as a couple of private citizens...

816
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,278
but I don't wanna know anything about it.

817
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,831
There's been too many corpses already.
So remember, no more blood.

818
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,672
Friends, may I have your attention, please?

819
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,954
In addition to my past contributions
to the city of Miami...

820
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,832
I am proud to announce...

821
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,674
that this will be
Miami's biggest ever construction project.

822
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,514
And I could never have done it
without your help. Thank you.

823
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,279
What a nuisance.

824
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,114
They should ban helicopters
from flying over residential areas.

825
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,950
How dare you interrupt my party!

826
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,032
-You'll pay for this.
-Sure. Bill my partner.

827
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,236
Who? Who are you, anyway?

828
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,556
Can we have a little talk?

829
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,073
Come into the house. Excuse me, please.

830
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,678
Take a seat, please.

831
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,034
Take the chair. It looks stronger.

832
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,670
The only excuse
I can find for you gentlemen...

833
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,155
is that you're from a loony farm.

834
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,559
What do you want?

835
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,154
We wanna tell you a piece of old history.

836
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,435
Just to see how good your memory is.

837
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,748
Eight years ago...

838
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,038
three bandits held up
the Detroit Federal Bank for $20 million.

839
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,869
And?

840
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,637
We caught one of them.
Only one of them: Garret.

841
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,390
But he wouldn't rat on anyone.

842
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,435
Very interesting. Continue.

843
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,080
Then Garret got out of jail
and came here to Miami...

844
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,869
to find his friend, Ralph Duran,
and his share in the robbery.

845
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,678
Garret found Duran.

846
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,437
But Duran had a new face and a new name,
and the same old killer instinct.

847
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,431
You can guess what happened next.

848
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,308
They found Garret's body
with 6 inches of cold steel in it.

849
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,434
And we're convinced
that Ralph Duran lives in this mansion...

850
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,637
and is sitting in front of us.
Right, Mr. Duran?

851
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,550
Fantastic. It's a bad joke.

852
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,476
You should be fiction writers.
You're wasted as cops.

853
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,998
I'm gonna ruin you.

854
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,997
Oh, yeah? Look at me.

855
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,749
I'm trembling all over, sir.

856
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,033
-I'll give you a chance to ruin us.
-How?

857
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,634
We wanna take your fingerprints
and see if they match Duran's.

858
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,037
-If we're wrong, you can bury us.
-Okay with me.

859
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,555
I've got nothing against
you taking my prints.

860
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,029
But first, I'd like to make a call.

861
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,673
<i>Miami Police Dept. Can I help you?</i>

862
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,593
Robert Delmann speaking.
Get me Mr. Risner.

863
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,235
He's the Police Commissioner.

864
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,995
<i>My dear Robert, what can I do for you?</i>

865
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,152
Joe, two of your men are in my house...

866
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,232
with some cockamamie story
about me not being myself...

867
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,390
but some hood named Duran.

868
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,391
A bank robber, a killer.

869
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,670
<i>-What?
-There's more.</i>

870
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,752
I believe these two are the crooks
who broke into my locker...

871
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,512
at the Golf Club the other night.

872
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,194
I didn't report it then, so I'll do it now.

873
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,875
<i>This is outrageous, Robert.
You have my utmost apologies.</i>

874
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,157
They insist on fingerprinting me.
Don't ask me why.

875
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,515
Naturally, I'm more than willing
to cooperate.

876
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,718
But I shall make a formal complaint
to the City, suing for damages.

877
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,359
I'm telling you all this
because you're an old friend.

878
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,591
Unfortunately, these jokers
are gonna cost you some headaches...

879
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,591
what with the elections coming up.

880
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,478
<i>Yes, of course. Put those two on the line.</i>

881
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,278
Go ahead, they can hear you.

882
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,112
<i>Identify yourselves.</i>

883
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,153
Officer Jay Donnel, Hialeah Department.

884
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,991
Officer L.A. Wray, ditto.

885
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,595
<i>Get back to your precinct
and consider yourselves under arrest.</i>

886
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,558
<i>Tell Tanney I'll be in his office
in half an hour.</i>

887
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,118
This country can boast of having
the greatest constitution in the world.

888
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,751
And you harass this city's
most influential and illustrious citizen.

889
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,917
I'm amazed at you, Tanney.

890
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,197
I don't need to tell you
I expect your resignation.

891
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,317
And you two,
hand in your uniforms and badges.

892
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,994
I've already notified your superiors.

893
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,516
They'll be taking the necessary action
against you.

894
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,113
That's all.

895
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,353
Sorry, Chief.

896
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,116
It's my fault, too.
We tried. It just didn't work out.

897
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,189
Thanks.

898
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,829
It's people like Delmann
that make the world a garbage dump.

899
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,754
I'm off the force, huh?
I'm going back to my helicopters.

900
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,916
Hello, Mrs. Clay. Can I help you?

901
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,912
We were just passing by,
so I said to the children:

902
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,912
"Let's go in and thank those two angels."

903
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,072
Donnel and Wray?

904
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,715
Right now, they need all the gratitude
they can get.

905
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,792
-Why is that?
-You see, they had a problem last week.

906
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,238
Here's the lot.

907
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,676
If it makes any difference,
the men are on your side.

908
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,839
Excuse me. I'm Mrs. Clay.

909
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,917
I heard about what happened,
and I'm really sorry.

910
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,197
The children and I wanted to thank you
for what you did.

911
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,669
-Yeah, sure.
-Take care, kids.

912
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,633
Good luck.

913
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,917
-And chin up, ma'am.
-Thank you.

914
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:35,391
Now you know why I quit the Bureau.
It's all politics.

915
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,948
At least we did something
for the Clay family.

916
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,155
Hey, taxi.

917
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,315
<i>You wanna say adios to Irene?</i>

918
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,277
No, I don't think so. What about Annabelle?

919
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,390
Are you kidding?
I'm not in the mood to arm-wrestle.

920
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:07,508
Let's just go and get our bags
and then head straight for the airport.

921
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,198
Hey, that sign!

922
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,948
"The eagle assures your future."

923
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,310
That bird's outside Room 5.

924
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,078
Turn around, immediately.

925
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,795
What the hell is going on here?

926
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,871
What is with you... I like your nerve!

927
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,071
Fellows, if you know how to pray,
now's the time.

928
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,394
Charro.

929
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,119
There it is.

930
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,755
Now we know why he needed
the hammer and the screwdriver.

931
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,319
All right!

932
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,194
Thanks, Charro. We'll be right back.

933
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,154
Listen, Chief.

934
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,549
Aren't you guys supposed to be
on an airplane?

935
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,676
Your resignation, did you hand it in?

936
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,036
No, I just got to writing it.
I'm gonna turn it in tomorrow.

937
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,509
-Well, don't.
-Why? What's going on?

938
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,798
Listen, by the time we've finished,
it'll be Risner's ass, not yours.

939
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,273
Excuse me, sir.

940
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,233
What is it, Ramon?

941
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,198
This special delivery just arrived for you.

942
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,715
Thank you.

943
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,075
-May I?
-I'm finished. Thank you.

944
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,439
<i>Hi, Ralph.</i>

945
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,593
<i>Your charred body was found March, 1978.</i>

946
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,511
<i>But you and I know it wasn't you.</i>

947
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,989
<i>It was our unlucky partner, Phillips.</i>

948
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,755
<i>We heard in the pen he disappeared
the same time your body was found.</i>

949
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,559
<i>You always used to talk about Florida
and disappearing...</i>

950
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:39,792
<i>and doing a plastic job on your face.
And who lived in Miami back then?</i>

951
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,599
<i>The number one
underground plastic surgeon, Danaisser.</i>

952
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:46,150
<i>It was only a month after your,
excuse me, Phillips' cremation...</i>

953
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,196
<i>that a truck blew Danaisser away.</i>

954
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,272
<i>Very neat, Ralph. Right off, I figured you...</i>

955
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,029
Who is it?

956
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,192
Right now, I bet
you're even paler than usual, paleface.

957
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:18,319
If you want the original of that tape,
come and get it, when and where I say...

958
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,597
and with $10 million,
plus eight years' interest...

959
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,636
<i>which makes an even $20 million.</i>

960
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:27,349
<i>-And if I don't show?
-You'll show. This is blackmail.</i>

961
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,557
Any tricks,
and I'll send the original to the FBI...

962
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:36,031
with a note suggesting they match your
fingerprints with those in Duran's old file.

963
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,758
$20 million is a lot of money.

964
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,799
You have eight hours to put it together.
We meet at 10:00 tonight.

965
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,996
The Yankee Company's portside warehouse.

966
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,672
Naturally, you'll come alone.

967
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,275
Ramon, I want all the men in my office
within a half hour.

968
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,833
Kill him!

969
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,832
What are you waiting for?
Turn on the lights!

970
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,597
-Damn. I thought so.
-Look, I'll give you the money.

971
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,716
Yeah, so will Santa Claus.

972
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,515
You're a mean shot, paleface.

973
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,831
They must be out of ammo.

974
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,516
Come on, let's go round behind them.

975
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,274
Come on.

976
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,790
Talk about a shocking sight.

977
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,914
Boss. Come on, let's get out of here.

978
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,518
Lots of deadwood.

979
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,517
Chief, what happened?

980
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,274
The next time,
I don't want just a bulletproof vest.

981
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,238
-I want a crash helmet, too.
-Where's Duran?

982
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,232
I have no idea,
but he didn't bring the money.

983
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,232
It ain't surprising.

984
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:04,353
-Let's see how you get out of this.
-Don't kill me. Name your price.

985
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,589
Maybe.

986
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,629
Maybe I'll give you a second face-lift.
No charge.

987
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,760
This is your lucky day, Duran.

988
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,034
Hi, Chief.

989
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,711
The 52nd floor.

990
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:58,432
That's where I saw you. The 52nd floor
of the FBI building in New York.

991
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,196
Special Agent Irene Allen.

992
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,794
I was sent to Miami to act as your cover...

993
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,839
and I just couldn't miss the ending
of your brilliant operation.

994
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,870
This is really too good to be true.

995
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,394
But I thought I told you no blood.

996
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,830
Come on, this is tomato sauce.

997
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,432
Well, you've got to go
make a little visit now.

998
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,714
Where?

999
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:27,156
You've got a score to settle.
Your friend, Com. Risner.

1000
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,989
Well, Doug, I enjoyed every minute.

1001
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,231
But next time, I won't let you trick me
into helping you again.

1002
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,790
So your mind's made up?
You're going back to your flying lessons?

1003
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,552
If I still got my students.

1004
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,471
Well, good luck.

1005
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,438
I forgot my wallet.

1006
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,797
