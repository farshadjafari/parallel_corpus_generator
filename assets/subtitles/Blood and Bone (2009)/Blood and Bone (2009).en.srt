1
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,262
It might not be any
of my business, but, uh...

2
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:12,203
JC's crew's headed this way
to bump you, and they all got shanks.

3
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,602
I know.

4
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:18,677
- Go, get out.
- Be good, homie.

5
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,588
- Out of my road, nigga.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:30,525
See this motherfucker right here?
This motherfucker think he special.

7
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,660
- want to be left alone and shit.
- Fucking yeah.

8
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,029
Don't want to be mobbed out
with the rest of us niggas,

9
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,727
like we ain't shit.
You understand what I am saying?

10
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:42,631
Shit don't work like that
around here, homeboy.

11
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:46,834
Yeah, you going with the pack,
you the pack bitch.

12
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,769
Feel me?

13
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:52,147
He kind of tight, too.

14
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,749
That shit don't mean nothing
round here though, player.

15
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:56,284
I have seen a whole lot of
built motherfuckers...

16
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:59,287
get their ass bent over
up in here every day.

17
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,949
You understand
what I am telling you?

18
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:05,586
I am talking to you, partner.

19
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,093
You got to the count of five.

20
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:17,061
- This motherfucker talking to me?
- One.

21
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:19,764
You hear this motherfucker?

22
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,042
Two.

23
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:25,380
- You hear this motherfucker?
- Three.

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,146
You just signed your own
death certificate, player.

25
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,876
Goddamn.

26
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,165
Shit.

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,775
I need you to deliver a message.

28
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:04,452
I want you to tell every
motherfucker behind these walls...

29
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:07,786
that if they get the notion
to fuck with me...

30
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,546
don't.

31
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:42,023
Man, you know it's hotter
than a motherfucker out here.

32
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:44,993
Then tell your mother to stick her fat
ass out the window and give us some shade.

33
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:46,995
Fuck you, nigga.

34
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,663
- Shit, here she comes.
- Hey.

35
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,413
Hi.

36
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,066
Are you tweaking? You all right?

37
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,167
You all holding?

38
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,466
- Yeah, what you think?
- Yeah, baby. You got some Swiss?

39
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,539
- Count this shit.
- Let me count that. Let me count that.

40
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,607
- Make sure she does.
- Good?

41
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,343
All crinkled up and shit.
Yeah, give it to her.

42
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,902
Hey.

43
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:09,951
You all get off my block before I
call the police on your asses again.

44
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:13,187
Fuck you, you old
Fred Sanford-looking ass.

45
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,556
Yeah, yo.
Take your ass back to TV Land,

46
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:18,958
you Nick-at-Nite-looking
motherfucker. Peace, homie.

47
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,605
Checkmate.

48
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,746
See, I told you I am always
thinking three moves ahead.

49
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,948
Thanks, baby.

50
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,940
You know, this thinking
generates heat.

51
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:02,566
Thank Jesus for the shade.

52
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:07,442
You looking for a room, mister?

53
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:08,932
Yeah.

54
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,502
Yeah, come on.

55
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:19,486
Hey, Tamara, there's a fellow
here looking for a room.

56
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:24,455
Jared, it's time
for dinner, baby.

57
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,100
Can I help you?

58
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,796
Sign says "Room for rent".

59
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:43,209
It may need a little airing out.

60
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:47,212
This is just fine.

61
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,784
You know, since I keep kids,
I have rules.

62
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:55,616
No gangsters, no guns,
no loud music...

63
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:59,519
and no women in or out.

64
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,156
So this may not be the type
of place that you're looking for.

65
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:09,236
This seems like just the kind of
place I am looking for.

66
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,203
So what's your name?

67
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:18,643
Call me Bone.

68
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:21,747
Well, Mr. Bone...

69
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,948
Ante up.

70
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:45,805
I am not taking a chance
on you, am I, Mr. Bone?

71
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,625
No.

72
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,107
Bone.

73
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:52,163
Come on, big fella.

74
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,030
Yeah, baby.

75
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:01,108
Yeah, bust his fucking ass.

76
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,186
Dicks on the wall.

77
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:20,601
And the winner, coming straight from
the New York City penal system,

78
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,170
the homicidal homosexual,

79
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,906
the savage faggot,

80
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:27,208
the queer that inspires fear,

81
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,677
the butt-battling bandit,

82
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:33,079
Mommie Dearest.

83
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:36,644
Dicks on the walls, baby.

84
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,573
Here we go. You up next.

85
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:05,011
Hey, this is serious.
This ain't no joke.

86
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:07,309
I am ready.

87
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:21,253
Let's get this show
on the road.

88
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,754
Yo. What up?

89
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,094
We got three to one.

90
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,124
Ladies and gentlemen,

91
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,659
niggas and bitches,

92
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,695
next up we got the man from
the Lone Star State,

93
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:57,932
the raging redneck,
half man, half steer,

94
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,234
a shotgun
and a bottle of beer, bitch.

95
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:04,071
This motherfucker, this motherfucker
right here's so raw,

96
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:07,241
he eats steaks directly
off live bulls' asses.

97
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:10,444
I am talking about the killer
from Dallas' grassy knoll.

98
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:15,348
Giddy-up, you all, for the Cowboy.

99
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,519
Nigga better be on tonight,

100
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,355
because he's going up against
the baddest of the bad.

101
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,660
Oh, yeah. I know you all know what
I am talking about, right? Right?

102
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,562
I am talking about
the unholy combination...

103
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:31,759
- from the Zulu nation.
- We got three to one.

104
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,493
Yeah, three to one.

105
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:37,004
You got 10 G on Hammer?
All right.

106
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,041
We're in the pipe, baby.
Five by five.

107
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:44,000
The Hammerman.

108
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,916
Okay, cuz, here we go.
I know he's a big motherfucker.

109
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,952
That is a big motherfucker,
but you are faster, man.

110
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,587
You're way faster.
All you got to do is stick and move,

111
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,656
stick and move, bob and weave,
like I told you.

112
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,249
Are you ready?

113
00:10:57,726 --> 00:10:59,493
Get him. Kill him.

114
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,962
I ain't scared of him.

115
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:05,128
Dumbass motherfucker.

116
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,893
Knuckle up.

117
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,366
Hammer, it's over.
Hammer, it's over.

118
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,234
It's over. Hammer, enough.
It's over.

119
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,767
It's over.

120
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:50,877
And the winner, once again,

121
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,679
the Hammerman.

122
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,279
What can I say?

123
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,794
You have still got one of the
hardest hitters in the streets.

124
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,728
Tell me about it.

125
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,766
Well, ain't you going to count it?

126
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,167
I trust you, Pinball.

127
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:18,739
Do I have a reason not to?

128
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,489
No.

129
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:21,968
Good.

130
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,372
Fuck.

131
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:40,916
Don't.

132
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,497
What the fuck you want?
What you want? My rims?

133
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,766
No, I don't want your rims.

134
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,167
Well, then, what the fuck?

135
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,504
I want to fight with Hammerman.

136
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,235
Oh, yeah, and I want to fuck Beyonce.

137
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:56,173
Looks like you need a new fighter.

138
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:59,280
So, you a fighter.

139
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,347
Yeah, you know what?

140
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,184
I could sling fifty cents of nickels
outside this car and hit ten fighters,

141
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:04,819
ain't one that can fuck
with Hammerman.

142
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,887
What the fuck's
so special about you?

143
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,948
Set me up a fight
and I will show you.

144
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:13,594
Well, first of all, it's going to cost
at least 20 large to set up a fight.

145
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,963
Second, Hammer don't fuck
with no scrubs.

146
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,832
You ain't got no name,
you ain't got nothing.

147
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,466
Who the fuck you think you are?

148
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,235
And third, you think
I am going to put up my own money...

149
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,503
for a fighter
I ain't never seen fight?

150
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:26,201
Shit, you must be smoking
that new kind of crack.

151
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,109
260 dollars.

152
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,737
Get me a fight with anyone.

153
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:35,683
- What's in it for me?
- 20%.

154
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,516
Use your own money,
you get 40.

155
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:45,492
Yeah.

156
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,895
James, Franklin here.

157
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:52,389
I'd like you to pay our old
friend Darryl a visit tonight.

158
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:54,994
Okay.

159
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:59,700
- I will handle it.
- By the way, nice suit

160
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:19,526
You out of here, James?

161
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,860
Yeah, a few things to take
care of, you know how it is.

162
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:32,929
You're looking kind of hard there,
ain't you, family?

163
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:35,832
Hard not to.

164
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,637
Yeah.

165
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:42,810
Angela.

166
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:07,141
James, you ain't met my
new fighter yet, huh? This is...

167
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:09,643
What the fuck
they call you, anyway?

168
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,413
- Bone.
- Bone. Bone.

169
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,049
I call him Bone because that's
what he breaking when he hits.

170
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,711
In your ass,
little Asian Liberace.

171
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,390
Teddy.

172
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,793
Boys, let's break it up.

173
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,574
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

174
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,609
You'd just as soon
glue mouse ears to your balls

175
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,411
and dangle them
in front of an angry alley cat

176
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,581
than fuck with that girl.

177
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:49,314
What?

178
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:52,045
Don't you ever do that again.

179
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:55,255
- What?
- Don't pretend like you don't know.

180
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,916
What?

181
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,587
Say "what" one more time.

182
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:05,666
Say "what" one more time
like you don't know.

183
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,963
What the fuck do you mean?

184
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,970
James, where we going?

185
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:20,908
Darryl's.

186
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,444
You all want to go to Darryl's?

187
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,685
I hear Shelly's cooking.

188
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,294
Take her home.

189
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:38,396
Let's roll, let's roll.
Come on, Angela, let's go.

190
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,882
Man, I got 260.
I got 260. Give me 10 to 1.

191
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:56,450
- No, baby, no, baby. 5 to 1.
- Come on.

192
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,786
- 5 to 1.
- Huh? You killing me, D.

193
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,388
That's the best odds
you're going to get for a scrub.

194
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,691
All right then. Let's do this.
5 to 1, and that suit.

195
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,161
Hey, yo, gather round.
Gather round, everybody.

196
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,729
We got one more match up tonight.

197
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,331
Gather round because
there's a new kid in town.

198
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,665
You all didn't know,
he was sent to serve somebody.

199
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:22,533
Yo, Big L, you ready?

200
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:25,677
Big L, whoop his ass.

201
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,750
Yeah, baby, break a bone, baby.
Break a bone.

202
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,479
All right, then.

203
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,945
Knuckle up.

204
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:58,473
Yo, Deke, give me
that motherfucking money...

205
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,051
We going to make some money.
You and me, baby.

206
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,153
You and me, partner. No doubt.

207
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,682
I am fucking getting this shit
all together.

208
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,356
We're going to start outside
of town, right?

209
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,859
A few little fights, here and there.
You just going to whoop some ass.

210
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,161
We're going to stack
our Swiss up just enough...

211
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,296
that these greedy motherfuckers
around here don't know what's up.

212
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,531
Then we go straight for James.

213
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,234
Man, fuck that motherfucker,
we're going straight for James...

214
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,269
because James is the real money
around here.

215
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,705
Boy, you got to treat
that psycho-ass nigga just right.

216
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,875
because that motherfucker will kill
your ass just as much as talk to you.

217
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,110
But we got to fuck with him
just right.

218
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,580
Take it out of here just enough
so we get the odds that we want.

219
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,084
Then we drop that motherfucker down.
But, fuck, you know he got Hammerman.

220
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,452
But Hammerman ain't never put down.

221
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,456
That's when your ass comes in.
You got to whoop that motherfucker's ass.

222
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,254
Yeah.

223
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:49,987
What can you tell me
about the girl?

224
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:53,934
Fuck that.
Hell no, no. No.

225
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:56,303
Get that shit out your head
right now, man. Fuck that.

226
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,705
You need to sit right there and have
a long, introspective conversation...

227
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,108
- with your dick there, homes.
- Tell me about the girl.

228
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:05,045
She's James's girl. That's all
the fuck you need to know.

229
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,180
Fuck me.

230
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:15,048
Angela Soto. All right,
that's her name.

231
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,591
James turned her real bad...

232
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:21,628
She was married, matter of fact,
to a man, a choirboy...

233
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,630
I forget his name.

234
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,065
Word on the street is,

235
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:29,469
James set him up, triple homicide,
sent his black ass to jail.

236
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,672
James just swooped in,
snatched the girl for himself

237
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,240
But the fucked up thing is,

238
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,108
I heard she was pregnant.

239
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:38,779
This motherfucker took her
to a clinic and got that baby...

240
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,380
After that,

241
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,146
she got hooked on the horse and
that's the end of that sordid tale.

242
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:46,019
Don't you ever tell me to tell
you that story again because...

243
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,732
that's the type of shit
that make a brother...

244
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:50,057
lose all hope
in humanity and shit.

245
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,925
You know what I am saying?

246
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,415
Yeah.

247
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:59,933
So this guy,
first time up, first hole,

248
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,425
first game, he swears,

249
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,838
par five, shoots an eagle.

250
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,040
An eagle, first try.

251
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,209
- Couldn't believe it.
- Wait. That reminds me, Darryl,

252
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,144
you get that thing off to Franklin?

253
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:14,341
Franklin, dude,
don't even worry about that guy.

254
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:19,453
We could have some music.

255
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:20,721
- Yes.
- Good idea.

256
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,247
- Well, I will get it, baby.
- Okay, okay.

257
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,792
Yeah, I am usually shooting
like a 79, 80.

258
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,761
This guy, 72, first game.

259
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:38,227
A little white-boy music
to aid digestion?

260
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:41,708
What's wrong, you don't think that
brothers are down with Wang Chung?

261
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,011
Take your baby by the hand...

262
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,173
See, he knows it.

263
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:49,649
Make her do a high handstand...

264
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,320
Take your baby by the heels...

265
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,756
- Come on, sing with me.
- See?

266
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,158
- Do the next thing that you feel...
- Do the next thing that you feel...

267
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:00,127
Sing with me.
You don't know it, right?

268
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:03,722
- We were so in phase...
- We were so in phase...

269
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:08,602
- In our dance hall days...
- In our dance hall days...

270
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:13,234
- We were cool on craze...
- We were cool on craze...

271
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:18,812
- When I, you, and everyone we knew
- When I, you, and everyone we knew

272
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:21,148
- Could believe, do...
- Could believe, do...

273
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:23,383
- and share in what was true...
- and share in what was true...

274
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,352
Darryl,

275
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,480
don't take this personal.

276
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:29,589
What?

277
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:32,786
- Get over here.
- Oh, my God.

278
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,530
Shut the fuck up.

279
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,959
Shut up, shut up.

280
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,053
God.

281
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:11,215
What good are you anymore?

282
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:16,888
You ain't nothing but a junkie.

283
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,266
What is the music on that thing?

284
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,101
It's a new joint, man.

285
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,572
By what's-his-name, you know,
the cat does the song, Homegirl.

286
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:02,008
Yeah, well turn it off. You know
I don't like profanity in my home.

287
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,170
My bad. It's off.

288
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:06,313
What is that thing anyway?

289
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:08,782
That, man, is the PKL 370.

290
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,717
Better known as the Pickle.

291
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:14,754
And check it. If I call you up,
all you got to do is press star 40,

292
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:18,959
and it automatically activates a GPS
that can find you anywhere by satellite.

293
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,460
It's tight, huh?

294
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,419
You know if you ever use
that thing on me, I will kill you.

295
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,868
I am messing with you, man.

296
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,964
Check this out.

297
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:37,878
One kick.

298
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:40,813
Folded up Big Lamont
like a paper bag.

299
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:44,985
Where's he from?

300
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,716
Only cat that knows is Pinball.

301
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:49,711
Okay.

302
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,397
Here's my boy.

303
00:24:57,397 --> 00:24:59,593
You're my babies.

304
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,970
Get back, get back,
get back, get back.

305
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,665
Get back.

306
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:09,209
- What's wrong with you?
- They eat dogs in China.

307
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,076
Get in here. Come on, man.

308
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,304
Yeah.

309
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:18,385
Them motherfuckers...

310
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:19,786
Sorry?

311
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,689
Just saying, they're looking
at me like Chinese takeout.

312
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,954
It's because you don't know
how to treat them.

313
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:30,764
Just like everything else, you just
got to show them who their master is.

314
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,032
You ready?

315
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,133
For what?

316
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,001
Just tell me if you're ready.

317
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,137
Yeah, I am ready, man, I am ready.
What? What?

318
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:39,439
- Kill.
- James, stop messing around, James.

319
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,207
Stop messing around, man.

320
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,410
Get them motherfucking dogs
away from me, man.

321
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,900
Stop.

322
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:49,442
What did I tell you
about cursing?

323
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:55,346
Remember, profanity is a brutal vice.
He that uses it is no gentleman.

324
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,083
I got to warn you,
I am always thinking 3 moves ahead.

325
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,501
- He's looking fresh today.
- Yeah, yeah, with his church shoes on.

326
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,936
Yeah, I mean,
he likes this bike, right?

327
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,304
- I know you feeling it.
- See this?

328
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:12,906
- You see the bling?
- Bling, bling, bling.

329
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,542
You want that, right? You want that.
A fiend for that.

330
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:19,274
Jared. Get your little behind
up here right now.

331
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:24,017
Hey. You two good-for-nothings,
take that... Get off this block.

332
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,285
Man, fuck you,

333
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,854
you gray-haired,
Grandpa Moses-looking motherfucker.

334
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:30,390
You Metamucil-drinking-ass
motherfucker.

335
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,359
You don't want me
to come down there, do you?

336
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,926
All right.

337
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:46,206
It's all in the tone
of your voice.

338
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:49,175
That's how you get things done
around here.

339
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,810
Hey, yo, Bone.

340
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,040
Time to go, partner.

341
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,614
That's checkmate.

342
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,949
What? Checkmate?

343
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,384
I play four moves ahead.

344
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,917
Here.

345
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:12,821
Damn.

346
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:18,531
I am not sure I approve
of the company you keep, Mr. Bone.

347
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:22,306
Me, neither.

348
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:36,845
Hey.

349
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:40,427
You know Car Wash
is not just a movie.

350
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:44,497
This may seem like some old underground
fight club shit, low-key and all.

351
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,989
These motherfuckers
can scrap, though.

352
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,576
You see that chick?
I used to hit that.

353
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:58,669
Pretty hot for a fighter, huh?

354
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:04,818
Not anymore.

355
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,877
Shit.

356
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:12,919
And the winner is,

357
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,062
the vindictive Veretta Vendetta.

358
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,198
Don't get on her bad side, homies.

359
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,064
That's fucking right.

360
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,376
Tatt, what up?

361
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,711
- What's up, man?
- Chilling.

362
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,813
So, check this out.
I got this new fighter,

363
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,583
I will bet you 5 thousand,
what you think?

364
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,085
- Who?
- That man right there, Bone.

365
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,688
I am talking about your
best fighter right now. 5 G's.

366
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:43,790
- My best fighter?
- Your best fighter.

367
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,058
- All right, man.
- All right?

368
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,459
- Yeah.
- 5 G's?

369
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,257
All right.

370
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:54,160
Okay, we got the next fight.

371
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,995
Over here we got this guy, Bone.

372
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,975
He seems to think he can come here
and take all our money.

373
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:06,713
But tonight, he's got to put it all up
against the man with the golden grill.

374
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:10,583
Yeah. Now we already seen what
he does to a dude that he likes.

375
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,611
And I don't think he likes
this guy Bone very much, does he?

376
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:19,515
Okay. You guys ready?

377
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:22,083
Fight.

378
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:29,903
Holy shit.

379
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,305
What technique. What technique.

380
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:34,541
You ever see some shit like that?
I never seen no shit like that.

381
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,443
My man Bone will wreck shop
on your punk-ass fighters, man.

382
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,846
Two at a time, bitches.
Two at a time.

383
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:41,614
- Pay me, Tattoo. Pay me.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

384
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,449
What'd you say, two at a time?

385
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,751
Is that what you said, two?

386
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:47,253
Hey, everybody heard that?
Two at a time, okay?

387
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:50,323
- That's the bet. Two at a time.
- No, no, no, no, what bet? What bet?

388
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:51,391
Hey, hey, calm down, homie.

389
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:53,593
That's what you just said,
two at a time, right?

390
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:54,928
Hey, Carlos, Manuel.

391
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,996
Hold on. No, no, wait.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

392
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,032
You said two at a time.

393
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:01,301
- What, you scared? You going to forfeit?
- Fuck that, man. Fuck you.

394
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,702
Fuck you, homie.

395
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,465
Fuck you.

396
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,807
Your man as good as he says he is?
Let's do it.

397
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,510
- This is bullshit.
- Double or nothing.

398
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,847
No, no, no. Bone, Bone,
he owes us money right the fuck now.

399
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:15,872
Double or nothing.

400
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:20,147
Double or nothing.
Get this motherfucker, man.

401
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,467
What the fuck?

402
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:49,582
That's double.

403
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:52,483
- want to double up again?
- Hey, hey, hey.

404
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,884
David, Jesus, Lorenzo,
get this motherfucker, man.

405
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,632
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

406
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:10,365
One, two, three. Uno, dos, tres,
homes, just like that. What?

407
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:13,306
First bet was 5 thousand.

408
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,675
Double or nothing
on the second made it 10.

409
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:17,010
No fucking way, homie.

410
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,570
- Double that made it 20.
- Hey.

411
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,347
- Hey.
- You want to triple?

412
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,483
Hell no, motherfucker.
Hell no.

413
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:25,451
Hey, you said this motherfucker
was a beginner.

414
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:26,920
You said
he just got started, homie.

415
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,321
You said this motherfucker
was a beginner, homie.

416
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:29,956
- No. No, you took the bet.
- I ain't having it, man.

417
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,491
You took the action.
Time to pay up.

418
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:33,693
You want your money, homie?
You want your money?

419
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:36,396
Give me the fucking money, man.
You want your money? You see it?

420
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,524
It's right here, baby.

421
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,532
Come and get it.

422
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,602
What, motherfucker?
Come and get it.

423
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,073
Pussies.
These pussy motherfuckers, man.

424
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,474
- Right here.
- What the...

425
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,143
Right here. What?

426
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:51,633
Right there.

427
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:10,122
What now? You all weren't expecting
no superhero shit like that, huh?

428
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,768
Call me.

429
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,154
Goddamn.

430
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:39,182
You just took out the whole village.
The whole fucking village.

431
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:43,963
You know where that's been, right?

432
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,665
Goddamn, you are one
crazy son of a bitch.

433
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:48,134
I never met no crazy motherfucker
like you, you know what I am saying?

434
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:51,331
This motherfucker won't...
Oh, shit.

435
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:55,534
Pussy motherfuckers,
where you going?

436
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:57,777
Motherfuckers.

437
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,153
Ante up.

438
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:43,747
Break his hand.

439
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:58,624
Come on, break them off, man.
Break them off.

440
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,207
Get the money.

441
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,821
Man,

442
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,392
my whole life motherfuckers
played me for a mark.

443
00:35:31,392 --> 00:35:33,900
Act like I am some kind of punk.

444
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,801
Inside, I always felt
like a baller...

445
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,737
even though my pockets were flat.

446
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,175
And now it's all coming true.

447
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:44,473
And it's all because of you, B.

448
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:47,971
So what I am trying to say is,

449
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,142
I love you, B.

450
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:58,224
I don't mean that in a homosexual,
I am-trying-to-get-with-you kind of way.

451
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,352
I mean that in like...

452
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,128
Like a motherfucker who, now,

453
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:03,763
he-got-a-ride-to-match-his-rims
kind of way.

454
00:36:03,763 --> 00:36:06,664
You know what I am saying?
That's love.

455
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:12,437
Damn. That was
way mellow and shit.

456
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:23,010
What happened to you?

457
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,253
I had an accident.

458
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,855
What did you do,
trip and fall on someone's fist?

459
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,687
Come here.

460
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,656
Come here.

461
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,889
Sit down.

462
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:50,443
Are you always up this early?

463
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:54,380
Yes. To make breakfast
for the children.

464
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,650
You take good care of those kids.

465
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:04,590
Yeah, well, I do what I have to do to
stop them from being killers, thugs, hos,

466
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,524
street fighters.

467
00:37:10,364 --> 00:37:13,059
You have any family, Mr. Bone?

468
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,592
Long time ago.

469
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:20,405
What happened?

470
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:25,573
So, how long you been
taking care of the kids?

471
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:29,007
Well...

472
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,517
Angel I have had for 3 years,

473
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:36,154
Regina, about a year and a half,

474
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,925
and Jared, about a year.

475
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:44,495
Why does Jared
always stand at the window?

476
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:50,059
He's waiting for his folks
to come back.

477
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,341
As far as I know,
his father's in jail.

478
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:01,679
But he does have a mother
out there somewhere.

479
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:09,051
Thank you.

480
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:15,060
You know I saw you doing
tai chi out there.

481
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:21,225
I watch the old people
do it in the park, you know?

482
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:29,074
It just always looks so beautiful,
so relaxing.

483
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,976
Come here.

484
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,410
Let me show you something.

485
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:46,247
Okay.

486
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:50,722
This is tai chi.
This is called Push Hands.

487
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,589
Step with your right foot.

488
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,824
Put your hand here.

489
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:59,903
Now, this hand goes on my elbow.

490
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:03,275
Now, this is called Push Hands.

491
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:06,472
When I push, you yield,

492
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,181
roll back and push me.

493
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,816
Just like that.

494
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,716
And push with your hand.

495
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:18,318
And roll back.

496
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,349
There you go.

497
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,133
Checkmate.

498
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,121
Five moves ahead, young'un.

499
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,697
Shit.

500
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,343
Why you running?

501
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:46,011
You know you're going to twist an ankle.

502
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,981
I didn't do it, James.
I swear I didn't do it.

503
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:50,983
Do what? Why are you running?

504
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:55,254
because I know he told you what you
think I did, but I didn't do it, James.

505
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:58,357
I swear. I put that
on my babies, James, please.

506
00:40:58,357 --> 00:41:00,826
Then why don't you stop running
and tell me your side?

507
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:03,529
because ain't nobody got no
other side with you, James.

508
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,664
You think I am that one-sided?
I am that one-sided?

509
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:08,000
Monique, I am hurt. I am hurt.

510
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,069
Will you stop
climbing that fence?

511
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:13,095
You are giving me
a complex over here.

512
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,006
You know what?

513
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,057
Man, James.

514
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:35,589
- She's messed up.
- Now I feel bad.

515
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,781
Come on, let's go.

516
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,703
Shit.

517
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,729
kind of motherfucking name is Bone?

518
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:23,265
He's about to get boned
by the Hammer.

519
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:25,937
Know what I am saying?

520
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:32,117
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

521
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:33,778
Hold steady.

522
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:36,748
Just knock this motherfucker out.

523
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:40,192
Afterwards, we will get those little
schoolgirls, you know what I am saying?

524
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:42,361
You ready for this, Hammer?
You ready?

525
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:43,963
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

526
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:45,931
Let do this.
I don't smell no Hammer.

527
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:47,833
I smell pussy. Are you a pussy?

528
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,468
No. No. You're the Hammerman.

529
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:51,197
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

530
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,572
What's up, James?
How you doing, fam?

531
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:55,597
Got your money?

532
00:42:57,577 --> 00:43:00,879
Well, there it is, just waiting
for you to give it a little company.

533
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,904
You need to count it?

534
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:08,852
Bring him up.

535
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:15,385
Step to the rear,
because the Hammer is here. Yeah.

536
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:19,632
You know that thing you
always say every time I fight?

537
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:21,767
What? You mean,

538
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,570
"They call him Bone because
that's what he break when he hits"?

539
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,437
- Yeah.
- Don't say that.

540
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:31,610
All right motherfuckers
and motherfuckettes,

541
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,212
it's time for the main event.

542
00:43:33,212 --> 00:43:37,316
Now, without further ado,
let me bring to you,

543
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:39,618
coming straight
from Skull Island.

544
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,787
You all might know him
from his numerous appearances...

545
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:43,756
atop the Empire State Building,

546
00:43:43,756 --> 00:43:45,924
swatting down airplanes and shit,

547
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:48,460
the primate from another climate,

548
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,794
the Hammerman.

549
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:54,500
Hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

550
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,403
But now,
coming from this corner,

551
00:43:57,403 --> 00:44:00,339
he's new on the scene,
but he's stacking much green.

552
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,474
The one-technique
knockout artist...

553
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:05,878
who's breaking down pros
like they just got started.

554
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:08,013
The brother man
with death in each hand,

555
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:11,039
the man they call Bone,
because...

556
00:44:12,018 --> 00:44:14,720
Because that's what
his parents named him.

557
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,688
Bone.

558
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,518
And now, you hedonistic savages,

559
00:44:20,518 --> 00:44:22,491
knuckle up.

560
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:40,672
Come on, baby.

561
00:44:56,963 --> 00:44:58,452
Shit.

562
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:00,999
Shit.

563
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,991
Tastes like
a Timberland boot, bitch.

564
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:32,231
The man Bone.
The winner is my man Bone.

565
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:35,100
Yo, Hammy, he just took
your juiced-up ass to college.

566
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,635
Bone, bitches.

567
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:39,004
Yeah, yeah, no, get the money, right.
Get the money.

568
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,874
That's the deal.
Get the money, bitches.

569
00:45:41,874 --> 00:45:45,037
That motherfucker Bones
is the truth.

570
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,409
What can I say, James?
Homeboy just got lucky.

571
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:54,319
Yeah, well, like they say,

572
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,879
every dog has its day.

573
00:45:57,624 --> 00:46:00,285
This is yours, I guess.

574
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:13,672
Watch his leg.

575
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:15,265
My leg, man.

576
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,777
- It's just my leg.
- Put no weight on it.

577
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:20,972
Take it.

578
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,923
Mr. Bone, that was one
hell of a show.

579
00:46:37,063 --> 00:46:40,589
I never seen anything like that
before in my life.

580
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:43,802
You know, you cost me
a lot of money.

581
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:46,066
I hear you got a lot.

582
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,367
Not really.

583
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:55,637
You know, why don't you and Pinball
come by my place, celebrate?

584
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,916
That way we can talk.

585
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:01,045
I am sorry, James,
We got some plans.

586
00:47:01,045 --> 00:47:02,918
We will be there.

587
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:05,384
Good.

588
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:12,924
You know,
invincibility lies in defense.

589
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:16,026
Possibility of victory
in the attack.

590
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:25,310
You ain't got no qualm
with the Asiatic.

591
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:33,478
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

592
00:47:33,753 --> 00:47:36,153
Glad you two could make it.

593
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,558
Well, I didn't think you'd want to see us
after we won that money from you tonight.

594
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:41,960
Well, I guess it had to happen
sooner or later.

595
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,130
Didn't know
you had a secret weapon.

596
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,123
Poor, old Hammer's at the hospital
straightening out his knee.

597
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:52,496
Hey, baby, come meet my man, Bone.

598
00:47:52,772 --> 00:47:55,763
He just whooped the Hammerman.

599
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:06,215
Words can't describe
how little I give a damn.

600
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:24,558
Come, come, walk with me. Talk.

601
00:48:27,106 --> 00:48:29,870
Where'd you learn how to fight?

602
00:48:30,143 --> 00:48:31,974
Here and there.

603
00:48:32,178 --> 00:48:33,906
Here and there.

604
00:48:36,149 --> 00:48:38,742
I got something to show you.

605
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:44,821
I have always admired fighters
and the fight game.

606
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:47,826
A warrior's life,
that's the life for me.

607
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:50,693
There's honor and virtue.

608
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:54,199
A warrior's life must be pure
in body and in spirit.

609
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:58,067
That's why I don't drink,
I don't smoke, I don't use profanity.

610
00:48:58,638 --> 00:49:02,130
Genghis Khan once said,
the greatest pleasure...

611
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,166
is to vanquish your enemies
and chase them before you,

612
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:11,479
to rob them of their wealth
and to have those dear to them...

613
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:13,645
bathed in tears.

614
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:20,688
I am the punishment of God.

615
00:49:21,194 --> 00:49:24,196
And if you had not
committed great sins,

616
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:27,860
God would not have sent
a punishment like me upon you.

617
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:31,129
Genghis Khan.

618
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:34,803
You see?

619
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:39,644
I am not like the rest
of those thugs you see out there

620
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:44,912
smoking blunts and playing
video games and neither are you.

621
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:47,885
I could see that right off.

622
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:50,418
Do you train with weapons?

623
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:53,247
Catch.

624
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:57,456
Hey, hey, hey.

625
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:01,662
Now, I guess you're thinking,

626
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:08,403
what does this street hustler
know about honor and nobility?

627
00:50:10,276 --> 00:50:13,677
Well, the truth of the matter is,
not very much.

628
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:16,071
But I am learning.

629
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,984
I have a path, I have a vision,
I have a plan

630
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:22,420
that I would very much like you
to be a part of.

631
00:50:23,956 --> 00:50:25,445
How so?

632
00:50:25,445 --> 00:50:27,893
International underground
street fighting is by far...

633
00:50:27,893 --> 00:50:32,524
the biggest moneymaking
fight game, period.

634
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:36,034
It is the pastime
for a group of fat cats...

635
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:39,571
who like to call themselves
The Consortium.

636
00:50:39,571 --> 00:50:43,530
This is the game
that I am trying to get into.

637
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,346
You got an in?

638
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:51,383
You ever hear of a man
called Franklin McVeigh?

639
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:52,484
No.

640
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:57,222
Franklin McVeigh is an
international arms dealer. Large.

641
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:01,993
If there's a war in this world, that fool
is probably providing the party favors.

642
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:05,597
But he wasn't always this big.
He was a small-time thug from London,

643
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:07,632
selling pop guns to
the little black and brown kids...

644
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:08,733
on the streets of America.

645
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,828
Needless to say,
that is where I met him.

646
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:13,932
Anyway,

647
00:51:13,932 --> 00:51:19,534
Franklin McVeigh runs the international
fight game for The Consortium.

648
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:24,371
And he manages
the best fighter in the world.

649
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:30,155
They call him Pretty Boy Price

650
00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:31,590
Now, don't let his looks
fool you...

651
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,753
He has already killed
four men in the ring...

652
00:51:35,828 --> 00:51:40,128
Pound for pound, he's considered
the best fighter in the world.

653
00:51:41,734 --> 00:51:46,068
It costs five million dollars,
to get in the ring with him.

654
00:51:47,673 --> 00:51:52,701
Now, ordinarily, you would have
to work your way up the ranks...

655
00:51:53,479 --> 00:51:55,913
to get a fight with Price.

656
00:51:56,716 --> 00:51:58,683
But McVeigh owes me.

657
00:52:00,453 --> 00:52:05,617
I want to do to Franklin McVeigh
what you and Pinball did to me.

658
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:08,353
You beat Price,

659
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:11,393
you can retire a very rich man.

660
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:13,965
I will think about it.

661
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:16,400
What is there to think about?

662
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:20,904
Like I said,
I will think about it.

663
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:24,501
Okay, my friend. You do that.

664
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:27,540
But you should know

665
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:32,248
I don't like people
that say no to me.

666
00:52:33,085 --> 00:52:35,553
Maybe you should get used to it.

667
00:53:16,596 --> 00:53:19,223
This what you're looking for?

668
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:22,867
No.

669
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,563
I need you to do something
for me first.

670
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:29,438
Come with me.

671
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,141
What now?

672
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:43,948
Do you see that man
that you keep looking at?

673
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:50,119
I want you...

674
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,701
Fuck you and the mule
you rode in on.

675
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:00,972
Hey. What'd I tell you
about that language?

676
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:03,100
Fuck you.

677
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,704
Come here.

678
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,917
Do you know
what I can do to you?

679
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:19,481
Look at me.

680
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:22,886
No, really, look at me.

681
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,728
Now, you know
what I am capable of, right?

682
00:54:34,573 --> 00:54:36,540
And you know...

683
00:54:37,843 --> 00:54:40,106
that I will do it, too.

684
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:53,255
So why don't you
go over there...

685
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:57,885
and do what I told you to do?

686
00:55:03,602 --> 00:55:05,296
Come with me.

687
00:55:32,698 --> 00:55:36,964
"Take care of my wife
and my kid".

688
00:55:38,637 --> 00:55:40,900
That's what he told me.

689
00:55:42,074 --> 00:55:45,338
That's the last thing he said
before he died.

690
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:48,638
Who?

691
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,577
Who do you think?

692
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,055
Danny.

693
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:36,487
You knew Danny?

694
00:56:39,331 --> 00:56:40,832
How?

695
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,732
In prison.

696
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,094
He was my friend.

697
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:53,002
Well, sorry to do this
to you, but...

698
00:56:54,213 --> 00:56:56,010
Checkmate.

699
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,709
Man.

700
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:04,018
Hey, check this out, man.

701
00:57:09,128 --> 00:57:11,696
It's a beautiful picture, man.

702
00:57:11,696 --> 00:57:13,687
That's my family.

703
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,361
My wife and my son.

704
00:57:16,669 --> 00:57:20,366
Never got a chance to meet him,
but I am going to see him soon.

705
00:57:26,412 --> 00:57:29,113
You know, you remind me
of my brother.

706
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,809
Really? You have a brother?

707
00:57:32,184 --> 00:57:33,818
Had a brother.

708
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,547
A twin.

709
00:57:37,256 --> 00:57:39,485
What happened to him?

710
00:57:41,193 --> 00:57:43,422
Somebody killed him.

711
00:57:43,863 --> 00:57:46,024
Thought he was me.

712
00:57:54,273 --> 00:57:56,331
Some chess.

713
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:02,939
Come here.

714
00:58:05,284 --> 00:58:07,519
All inmates to their cells, now.

715
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:09,254
- Go.
- Lock it down, lock it down.

716
00:58:09,254 --> 00:58:11,188
Back in your cells.

717
00:58:18,697 --> 00:58:20,459
Come here.

718
00:58:22,034 --> 00:58:23,535
Tell me something.

719
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:25,203
Is this the woman
that Danny cried over...

720
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:28,673
and begged me to look after
as he was dying?

721
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:30,700
Danny.

722
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,444
Did you forget you had a son?

723
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:35,113
Don't you judge me.

724
00:58:35,113 --> 00:58:37,673
Don't you fucking judge me.

725
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:42,919
The whole reason I am in this shit
is because of Danny and my son.

726
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:46,851
I knew James set him up
to get to me.

727
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:52,027
I also knew
that if he couldn't have me,

728
00:58:55,868 --> 00:58:58,859
he would have killed Danny
and my son.

729
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:22,655
I always hoped he'd get
tired of me and let me go.

730
00:59:23,195 --> 00:59:25,424
I could find my son.

731
00:59:26,632 --> 00:59:29,566
But that's all just a pipe dream.

732
00:59:30,903 --> 00:59:33,667
I don't know where my son is.

733
00:59:35,007 --> 00:59:37,668
I don't even know if he's alive.

734
00:59:45,951 --> 00:59:48,976
Your son is alive
and I know where he is.

735
00:59:49,688 --> 00:59:53,954
So let's get you cleaned up
and go get your son.

736
00:59:57,363 --> 01:00:00,627
So that's what
this whole thing is about, huh?

737
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:07,634
You're my white knight here
to save me from the tower?

738
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:11,637
Well, I don't know
about white knight.

739
01:00:15,514 --> 01:00:21,008
Okay, just play along, smile,
act like we just had a good time.

740
01:00:24,056 --> 01:00:25,545
That's good.

741
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:29,611
So?

742
01:00:33,198 --> 01:00:36,895
So I think
I am going to like this organization.

743
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:42,905
You don't look any worse for wear.

744
01:00:43,175 --> 01:00:45,142
Why should I?

745
01:00:46,245 --> 01:00:50,078
It feels good
to make love to a real man.

746
01:00:53,452 --> 01:00:55,214
Hey, listen.

747
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:57,979
If you're tired of her,

748
01:00:58,691 --> 01:01:02,649
why don't you let me take her
off your hands for a while?

749
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:10,433
Well, I might consider
to do that.

750
01:01:10,636 --> 01:01:14,230
Depends upon what
you're willing to do for me.

751
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,397
What you think?

752
01:01:19,878 --> 01:01:22,403
Get your stuff together.

753
01:01:23,415 --> 01:01:26,050
You're going with Bone
for a while.

754
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:30,419
And don't forget your medicine.

755
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:48,131
So we will talk about this
later, right?

756
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:52,274
All right?

757
01:02:02,488 --> 01:02:04,922
Where are you taking me?

758
01:02:05,824 --> 01:02:09,316
Someplace where you can
get yourself back together.

759
01:02:09,995 --> 01:02:11,860
Okay.

760
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,331
So, what's up?

761
01:02:18,637 --> 01:02:20,695
See all that?

762
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:25,200
All that is mine.

763
01:02:25,577 --> 01:02:28,773
Every block,
every sidewalk, every alley.

764
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,653
It's all so...

765
01:02:37,623 --> 01:02:39,924
dark and unsophisticated.

766
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:43,292
It is not where
I want to be anymore.

767
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:49,493
- It's anonymous, right?
- Absolutely, sir.

768
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:54,360
We're good.

769
01:02:54,907 --> 01:02:58,409
What about my son?
I want to see my son.

770
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:00,775
Not till you're straight.

771
01:03:03,715 --> 01:03:05,773
This way, miss.

772
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:10,410
Bone.

773
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:14,722
Thank you.

774
01:03:54,233 --> 01:03:58,536
Good to see you, James.
You should visit more often.

775
01:03:58,536 --> 01:04:02,666
I hear you have become quite the golfer.
Yes.

776
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:06,210
But unfortunately,
I just lost my golfing partner.

777
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,203
You, my friend, should learn
the fine art of subtlety.

778
01:04:10,883 --> 01:04:14,318
So what do I owe the pleasure
of this visit?

779
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:21,826
Five million dollars.

780
01:04:21,826 --> 01:04:23,760
What's this for?

781
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,262
I want a fight
with your pretty boy.

782
01:04:27,566 --> 01:04:31,435
So we're looking to sit
at the grownups' table, are we?

783
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:33,528
I have a fighter.

784
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,741
This guy's the real deal.

785
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:38,376
You're not talking
about Hammerman, are you?

786
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:40,278
He's not even in Price's league.

787
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:43,447
No, this is a new guy.
Best I have ever seen.

788
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:45,483
And I have seen Price.

789
01:04:45,483 --> 01:04:47,852
Well, it's not as simple
as that, James.

790
01:04:47,852 --> 01:04:51,722
The Consortium is owned
by a private organization.

791
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:55,493
All newcomers have to be
agreed upon by committee.

792
01:04:55,493 --> 01:04:57,621
Come on, Franklin.

793
01:04:58,563 --> 01:05:01,766
After all I have done for you... you
couldn't do me this one little thing?

794
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:04,929
You're asking me to vouch for you.

795
01:05:06,204 --> 01:05:09,473
Well, the funny thing
about vouching for someone, James,

796
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:11,709
is that when that someone
shows themselves

797
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:14,011
to be less than what was promised,

798
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:18,049
every decision you take from
that point on is second-guessed.

799
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:21,319
And that, in my line of work,

800
01:05:21,319 --> 01:05:23,287
is suicide.

801
01:05:24,056 --> 01:05:28,793
Besides, why does a cool,
mellow fellow like yourself

802
01:05:28,793 --> 01:05:33,331
want to hang around with a
bunch of stuffy, old white guys?

803
01:05:33,331 --> 01:05:37,734
Same reason you want to hang around
those stuffy, old white guys.

804
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:39,292
Power.

805
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,960
Connections.

806
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,631
But let's keep it real.

807
01:05:42,631 --> 01:05:45,503
I am just a cool, mellow fellow,

808
01:05:45,503 --> 01:05:48,012
just shucking and jiving,

809
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:51,749
crip-walking, basketball-playing,
singing and dancing

810
01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:54,775
and taking out your garbage.

811
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,684
That's what I am to you.

812
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,125
You're right.

813
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:05,429
You are African-American.

814
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:09,400
And myself and my friends,
for the most part,

815
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,463
don't care for the company
of African-Americans.

816
01:06:14,463 --> 01:06:18,576
Quite frankly,
we're entertained by you.

817
01:06:18,576 --> 01:06:23,114
We're thrilled by your high-flying
acrobatics on the basketball court,

818
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:26,250
that wonderful sense
of rhythm you have,

819
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,320
your animal athleticism.

820
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,311
But apart from that,

821
01:06:31,523 --> 01:06:34,355
we have no use for you.

822
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,390
Understand?

823
01:06:39,297 --> 01:06:41,899
I mean, let's face it, James.

824
01:06:41,899 --> 01:06:47,303
Do you set a place at your
dinner table for your pit bulls?

825
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:51,933
Now, is this keeping it
real enough for you?

826
01:06:53,712 --> 01:06:58,672
I have another theory on this subject
matter and it goes something like this.

827
01:06:58,672 --> 01:07:00,451
I imagine several
hundred years ago,

828
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,821
a group of very powerful men,
not unlike yourself,

829
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:06,813
were out
conquering the known world.

830
01:07:06,813 --> 01:07:08,592
So they get to Africa,

831
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:09,994
feeling pretty good
about themselves,

832
01:07:09,994 --> 01:07:15,455
definitely feeling superior to the
savages they see running in the jungle.

833
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:20,633
That is, until one of the brothers
drops his loincloth.

834
01:07:22,174 --> 01:07:25,837
And then these powerful men
all of a sudden...

835
01:07:25,837 --> 01:07:28,813
come face to face, so to speak,

836
01:07:28,813 --> 01:07:32,044
with one of life's
great inequities.

837
01:07:33,118 --> 01:07:38,021
Let's whip them out and I will settle
that myth right here and now.

838
01:07:38,223 --> 01:07:40,020
Let's go.

839
01:07:43,395 --> 01:07:45,453
Okay, my friend.

840
01:07:45,453 --> 01:07:48,931
I will stick my neck out
and vouch for you.

841
01:07:49,668 --> 01:07:53,228
But if you let me down
in front of my people,

842
01:07:53,872 --> 01:07:58,638
life will become very lonely
for you out there on those streets.

843
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:02,276
Am I clear?

844
01:08:03,782 --> 01:08:05,715
Clear as water.

845
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:11,455
I am hosting a retreat for Consortium
members over the next three days.

846
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:14,254
Have your man ready in two.

847
01:08:15,427 --> 01:08:17,485
He will be ready.

848
01:08:29,174 --> 01:08:30,663
Wait.

849
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:32,510
I know this man.

850
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,535
You know him?

851
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,211
His name is Roberto.

852
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,481
He liked to help kids.

853
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:55,729
You hear about Roberto?

854
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:02,405
Yeah. I saw him.

855
01:09:04,643 --> 01:09:08,306
They put the dogs
on that poor, sweet old man.

856
01:09:10,282 --> 01:09:12,477
Put the dogs on him.

857
01:09:13,852 --> 01:09:17,810
Chewed him up
like a piece of meat.

858
01:09:25,063 --> 01:09:26,928
I just don't...

859
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:31,829
I don't understand
this place anymore.

860
01:09:33,772 --> 01:09:35,500
I don't.

861
01:09:36,641 --> 01:09:38,540
I am just saddened.

862
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:44,939
It will get better.

863
01:09:59,531 --> 01:10:02,727
Mr. Bone,
someone's here to see you.

864
01:10:06,404 --> 01:10:08,735
Come on, baby, let's go.

865
01:10:12,277 --> 01:10:14,074
Cute kid.

866
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:17,170
Always wanted one of my own.

867
01:10:18,516 --> 01:10:21,849
I got to call you
pimp of the year, player.

868
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:24,355
I give you my best girl
two days ago.

869
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:28,792
I turn around, find you
putting it to the nanny.

870
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:31,958
What're you doing here?

871
01:10:33,064 --> 01:10:35,191
It's on, brother.

872
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:36,271
It is on.

873
01:10:39,437 --> 01:10:41,071
What is on?

874
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:45,668
The fight
between you and Price.

875
01:10:47,946 --> 01:10:50,481
You put the money up
for the fight?

876
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:52,711
Five million dollars.

877
01:10:53,351 --> 01:10:56,183
But I never said I would fight.

878
01:10:56,183 --> 01:10:58,116
Excuse me?

879
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:00,850
I told you I'd think about it.

880
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:03,127
I thought about it.

881
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:05,323
Decided not to fight.

882
01:11:07,832 --> 01:11:10,823
Man, are you out of your
fucking mind?

883
01:11:11,036 --> 01:11:14,801
Five million dollars.

884
01:11:16,074 --> 01:11:19,441
- Get it back.
- Get it back. Get it back.

885
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,377
Do you know...

886
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:25,779
how much shit
you are getting me in?

887
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,711
You're smarter than that.

888
01:11:32,424 --> 01:11:36,223
You are in that fight.

889
01:11:37,762 --> 01:11:40,059
Yes, motherfucker.

890
01:11:40,465 --> 01:11:42,660
You are in that fight...

891
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:45,668
or somebody's going to be dead.

892
01:11:50,675 --> 01:11:52,164
You're right.

893
01:11:52,577 --> 01:11:54,203
Somebody might be.

894
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:55,930
No.

895
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:59,481
Ease the fuck back there,
motherfucker.

896
01:12:46,865 --> 01:12:48,798
Look. Listen.

897
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:52,569
I want you to take this money,
take the kids and check into a hotel.

898
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:56,904
Stay there till you hear from me.
It's too dangerous for you now.

899
01:12:57,342 --> 01:12:59,036
I will.

900
01:12:59,878 --> 01:13:03,074
But when I come back,
I want you gone.

901
01:13:11,022 --> 01:13:13,183
Rustle up the crew now.

902
01:13:13,558 --> 01:13:15,259
I want every motherfucker
with a gun...

903
01:13:15,259 --> 01:13:18,729
locked, loaded and ready
to regulate in 15 minutes.

904
01:13:18,729 --> 01:13:22,266
Get Bone, get Pinball,
that bitch,

905
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:26,635
the nanny,
all of them motherfuckers.

906
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:46,282
You smell like
watermelon bubblegum.

907
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,324
Where that motherfucker, Bone?

908
01:13:55,467 --> 01:13:57,401
Well, the last time I saw him,

909
01:13:57,401 --> 01:13:58,643
I believe
he was at your mother's house...

910
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:02,099
with a box of condoms
and a bucket of chicken.

911
01:14:03,141 --> 01:14:05,040
He got jokes.

912
01:14:09,747 --> 01:14:13,050
You done did it now.
Don't you know I am from Pittsburgh?

913
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,751
We don't play that shit.

914
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:15,501
No.

915
01:14:18,089 --> 01:14:20,887
I said, where that nigga, Bone?

916
01:14:21,759 --> 01:14:23,920
Where that nigga...

917
01:14:25,296 --> 01:14:26,964
- ... Bone?
- Hold on, slick.

918
01:14:26,964 --> 01:14:31,060
Where that nigga, Bone?
Where that nigga, Bone?

919
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,005
Where that nigga, Bone?

920
01:14:35,005 --> 01:14:37,804
I said, where that nigga, Bone?

921
01:14:38,076 --> 01:14:40,601
Where that nigga, Bone?

922
01:14:54,826 --> 01:14:57,928
Man, B, you're really good with
that gun as you are with your fists.

923
01:14:57,928 --> 01:14:59,630
You going to tell me what the hell's
going on around here?

924
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:02,266
You want to talk about it here
or down at the police station?

925
01:15:02,266 --> 01:15:03,734
Yeah, let's talk about that later.

926
01:15:03,734 --> 01:15:07,136
But help me get this
side of beef off of me.

927
01:15:09,841 --> 01:15:11,008
James.

928
01:15:11,008 --> 01:15:13,810
Homegirl says
she got the 411 on Angela.

929
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,513
Yeah, I seen that girl you all was
talking about at the Intersection.

930
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:19,116
- What intersection?
- No, man the Intersection,

931
01:15:19,116 --> 01:15:23,153
back where the judge sent me
to get clean, she in there.

932
01:15:23,153 --> 01:15:25,417
That girl, she in there.

933
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:37,664
Seven.

934
01:15:52,617 --> 01:15:54,311
Angela.

935
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:58,221
Angela, come on, get up.

936
01:15:58,221 --> 01:15:59,823
What's up, bitches?

937
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:01,655
The fuck you going to do?

938
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:05,854
Don't move. because I'd love to
bust a cap in one of your asses.

939
01:16:18,576 --> 01:16:20,407
Get their cell phones.

940
01:16:31,456 --> 01:16:35,357
- You got that bitch yet?
- Yeah, I have got her...

941
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,226
- Bone?
- Now I am coming for you...

942
01:16:43,968 --> 01:16:45,765
Fuck.

943
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:05,515
Okay, motherfucker.

944
01:17:07,358 --> 01:17:09,553
Okay, motherfucker.

945
01:17:11,729 --> 01:17:14,164
- What's up?
- You want to play games?

946
01:17:14,164 --> 01:17:17,634
Time to play
follow the motherfucking leader.

947
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,741
Shit. He wants us to follow him.

948
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,677
And I think I know where.

949
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:32,983
Yeah, Franklin. James.

950
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:36,544
That fight,
it has to happen tonight.

951
01:18:33,778 --> 01:18:35,445
Good evening, sir.

952
01:18:35,445 --> 01:18:37,675
This way, if you will.

953
01:18:50,428 --> 01:18:53,863
Mr. Bone,
it's good of you to join us.

954
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:58,459
Like I said, family,
you are going to fight.

955
01:18:58,936 --> 01:19:02,064
And you are going to win me back
my money.

956
01:19:03,174 --> 01:19:05,175
And if I don't fight?

957
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:07,439
Then you will die.

958
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:11,848
And I will go back to town
and I will kill the nanny

959
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:16,285
and the three little brats
and your little rat, Pinball.

960
01:19:16,888 --> 01:19:18,755
And this will hurt.

961
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:22,350
But I will gut and filet Angela
like a sea bass.

962
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,427
Just like you killed Roberto.

963
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,964
That stupid old man opened
his mouth one time too many.

964
01:19:27,964 --> 01:19:32,169
And you killed my friend Danny in prison,
set him up for a murder he didn't commit.

965
01:19:32,169 --> 01:19:34,228
You knew Danny?

966
01:19:34,839 --> 01:19:37,671
So that's what this is about.

967
01:19:38,009 --> 01:19:40,067
Danny and Angela.

968
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:43,640
He was a stupid-ass boy.

969
01:19:43,981 --> 01:19:46,540
He didn't deserve Angela.

970
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:49,986
Well, I guess right about now
you will be getting the picture...

971
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:52,155
about how the fuck we roll.

972
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:55,358
James, you talk too much.

973
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:58,123
Yes, you do.

974
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:06,269
I want to report a possible homicide,
4215 Westgate Terrace.

975
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:09,534
Yeah, I am about to send you
a video. All right.

976
01:20:15,246 --> 01:20:18,408
So, you're ready to fight,
Mr. Bone?

977
01:20:18,816 --> 01:20:20,840
And if I don't?

978
01:20:21,385 --> 01:20:23,787
Then I will beat you
where you stand.

979
01:20:23,787 --> 01:20:25,856
Need I say more?

980
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,291
Do you want to change?

981
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:31,091
For what?

982
01:23:09,787 --> 01:23:11,584
Not bad.

983
01:23:58,669 --> 01:24:01,364
Winner by forfeit, Price.

984
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:07,736
You motherfucker.

985
01:24:08,612 --> 01:24:11,546
- James.
- Fuck you, too.

986
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:30,760
O'Hara.

987
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:42,338
- I will see you later.
- Nobody move.

988
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:43,706
L.A.P.D.

989
01:25:43,706 --> 01:25:46,767
L.A.P.D..
Everybody, stay where you are.

990
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,915
If I go down, you go down, too.

991
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,081
We will see.

992
01:25:57,855 --> 01:25:59,238
Hey, Bone, when I get out,

993
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,857
Hey, Bone, when I get out,

994
01:26:00,857 --> 01:26:03,588
you got family on the outside.

995
01:26:04,562 --> 01:26:07,087
Believe that, big homie.

996
01:26:08,065 --> 01:26:09,896
Believe that.

997
01:26:31,355 --> 01:26:33,823
want to go see your mommy?

998
01:26:36,427 --> 01:26:38,258
Go, baby.

999
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:56,137
Never going to leave you again.

1000
01:26:58,849 --> 01:27:00,680
Never again.

1001
01:27:12,296 --> 01:27:17,096
I know I said you had to leave,
but you can stay if you like.

1002
01:27:19,336 --> 01:27:24,739
No, you were...
You were right. I am trouble.

1003
01:27:25,676 --> 01:27:30,272
You knew that boy was here
the whole time, didn't you?

1004
01:27:31,548 --> 01:27:34,016
And who his mother was...

1005
01:27:34,016 --> 01:27:37,950
long before you ever came
and knocked on my door.

1006
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:44,788
I have got some money
in this envelope for you.

1007
01:27:45,329 --> 01:27:47,558
Nobody's looking for it.

1008
01:27:49,099 --> 01:27:53,936
I'd like Angela to stay here with
Jared after she gets cleaned up.

1009
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:57,133
- That's if it's all right with you.
- It's all right.

1010
01:28:00,744 --> 01:28:04,907
You did all of this just
to keep a jailhouse promise?

1011
01:28:05,983 --> 01:28:08,542
I like to keep my promises.

1012
01:28:13,157 --> 01:28:15,090
I got to go.

1013
01:28:39,483 --> 01:28:41,382
Thank you.

1014
01:28:47,424 --> 01:28:49,585
Give you a lift?

1015
01:28:50,994 --> 01:28:51,744
No.

1016
01:28:52,963 --> 01:28:55,124
I think I will walk.

1017
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:59,569
Life in the city
keep going, don't it?

1018
01:28:59,569 --> 01:29:01,170
Oh, yeah.

1019
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,238
Sure you don't want to stick around?

1020
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:06,042
I could set some fights up.
We could make some real money, man.

1021
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:10,172
Nope. Got some business
to take care of.

1022
01:30:21,051 --> 01:30:23,109
Sit on my shank, motherfucker.
