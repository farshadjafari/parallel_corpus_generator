2
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,969
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

3
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,299
<i>it walked with its arms swinging.</i>

4
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,109
<i>It wanted the stream to be a river...</i>

5
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,700
<i>the river a torrent...</i>

6
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,719
<i>and this puddle to be the sea.</i>

7
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,689
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

8
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,189
<i>it didn't know it was a child.</i>

9
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,159
<i>Everything was full of life...</i>

10
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,719
<i>and all life was one.</i>

11
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,490
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,899
<i>it had no opinion about anything.</i>

13
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,730
<i>It had no habits.</i>

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,709
<i>It often sat cross-legged, took off running...</i>

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,569
<i>had a cowlick in its hair...</i>

16
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,239
<i>and didn't pull a face when photographed.</i>

17
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,930
Look!

18
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,009
<i>The consolation of lifting one's head
out here in the open...</i>

19
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,479
<i>the consolation of seeing the color...</i>

20
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:41,219
<i>enlightened through the sun
in all men's eyes.</i>

21
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
<i>At last mad, at last no longer alone!</i>

22
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,460
<i>At last mad, at last redeemed!</i>

23
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,870
<i>At last mad, at last at peace!</i>

24
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,199
<i>There's a little house...</i>

25
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:24,829
<i>with two floors and a terrace.</i>

26
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,129
<i>And every day we go bathing.</i>

27
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,430
<i>And the man who lives there....</i>

28
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,300
<i>I don't even understand this character.</i>

29
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,569
<i>It's amazing how little
I know about this part.</i>

30
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,439
<i>maybe we'll discover it during the shoot.</i>

31
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,779
<i>I'll get a good costume,
That's half the battle.</i>

32
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,449
<i>Berlin.</i>

33
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,449
<i>Emil Jannings.</i>

34
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,449
<i>Kennedy.</i>

35
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,189
<i>Von Stauffenberg.</i>

36
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,759
<i>Hell of a guy.</i>

37
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,420
What a pretty picture!

38
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,360
<i>That wasn't in Berlin.</i>

39
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,839
<i>What difference does it make? It happened.</i>

40
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,740
<i>If grandma was here, she'd say "spazier."</i>

41
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,329
"Go spazieren."

42
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,399
<i>Tokyo, Kyoto...</i>

43
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>Paris, London, Trieste...</i>

44
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,470
<i>Berlin.</i>

45
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,199
<i>Nothing to see on TV.</i>

46
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,029
<i>You stumble over your colors
and are never punctual.</i>

47
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,199
<i>I'll think of something.</i>

48
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,480
<i>It's still the same smell. But dustier.</i>

49
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,019
<i>She collected everything.</i>

50
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,019
<i>...even U-Bahn tickets.</i>

51
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,620
<i>She never threw anything away.</i>

52
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,189
<i>Mother, my mother...</i>

53
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,329
<i>she never was.</i>

54
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,889
<i>My father....</i>

55
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,000
<i>My father was my father.</i>

56
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:14,670
<i>She is dead.</i>

57
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,139
<i>No tears, no grief.</i>

58
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,970
<i>Maybe later.</i>

59
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,769
<i>She doesn't love you,
she has never loved you.</i>

60
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,240
<i>And you too are only pretending.</i>

61
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,279
<i>You should be glad they've forgotten you.</i>

62
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,339
<i>At last you're free.</i>

63
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,019
<i>My God, what will become of the boy?</i>

64
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,360
<i>He's only got music in his head.</i>

65
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,930
<i>What does he want now?</i>

66
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,100
<i>I already bought him a guitar.</i>

67
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,579
<i>Now he wants drums.</i>

68
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,670
<i>In the end, I'm getting fed up with it.</i>

69
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,720
<i>Won't he ever grow up?</i>

70
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,889
<i>I'm getting fed up.</i>

71
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,960
<i>I can't help him anymore.</i>

72
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,529
<i>No wonder. He only learned rock n' roll.</i>

73
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,200
<i>Maybe he'll grow up one day.</i>

74
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,110
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

75
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,120
<i>it was the time of these questions.</i>

76
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,690
<i>Why am I me...</i>

77
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,929
<i>and why not you?</i>

78
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,299
<i>Why am I here, and why not there?</i>

79
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,559
<i>When did time begin,
and where does space end?</i>

80
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,250
<i>Isn't life under the sun just a dream?</i>

81
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,149
<i>Isn't what I see, hear, and smell...</i>

82
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,480
<i>just the mirage of a world before the world?</i>

83
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,120
<i>Does evil actually exist...</i>

84
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,059
<i>and are there people who are really evil?</i>

85
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,899
<i>How can it be that I, who am I...</i>

86
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,610
<i>wasn't before I was...</i>

87
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,470
<i>and that sometime I, the one I am...</i>

88
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,970
<i>no longer will be the one I am?</i>

89
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,720
<i>The child needs oxygen.</i>

90
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,009
<i>Breathe deep down.</i>

91
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,110
<i>If I could only suffer in her place.</i>

92
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,450
<i>It hurts! But it'll be over soon.</i>

93
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,389
<i>It's almost over.</i>

94
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,039
<i>Poor little mite, I'm anxious to see you.
I just wonder what you'll look like.</i>

95
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,759
Bastard!

96
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,070
<i>Women will fuck up your life.</i>

97
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,700
<i>Blackie, I've lost my way.
We wanted to go to the cemetery.</i>

98
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,809
Well?

99
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,960
Sunrise at 7:22, sunset at 4:28.

100
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,549
Moonrise at 7:04, moonset....

101
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,389
Water level of the Havel and the Spree.

102
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,370
Twenty years ago today...

103
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,799
a Soviet jet fighter crashed
in Spandau Lake.

104
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,330
Fifty years ago there were--

105
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,070
The Olympic Games.

106
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:50,240
Two hundred years ago,
Blanchard flew over the city in a balloon.

107
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,909
Like the fugitives the other day.

108
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,379
And today...

109
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,919
on the Lilienthaler Chaussee,
a man walks slowly...

110
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,820
and looks over his shoulder into space.

111
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,529
At Post Office 44, someone who wants
to put an end to it today...

112
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,620
has stuck collectors' stamps
on his farewell letters.

113
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,100
A different one on each.

114
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:16,730
Then he spoke English
with an American soldier...

115
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,289
for the first time since his schooldays,
very fluently.

116
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,840
A prisoner at Plötzensee...

117
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,509
just before dashing his head
against the wall...

118
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,950
said, "Now!"

119
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,789
At the Zoo U-Bahn station, the guard,
instead of the station's name...

120
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,039
suddenly shouted, "Tierra del Fuego!"

121
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,990
In the hills, an old man was reading
<i>The Odyssey</i> to a child...

122
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,929
and the young listener
stopped blinking his eyes.

123
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,629
And what do you have to tell?

124
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,809
A passer-by, in the rain,
folded her umbrella...

125
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,440
and was drenched.

126
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,480
A schoolboy...

127
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,110
who described to his teacher...

128
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,019
how a fern grows out of the earth,
and astounded the teacher.

129
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,289
A blind woman who groped for her watch...

130
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,159
feeling my presence.

131
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:20,129
It's great to live by the spirit,
to testify day by day...

132
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,830
for eternity, only what's spiritual
in people's minds.

133
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,009
But sometimes I'm fed up
with my spiritual existence.

134
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,950
Instead of forever hovering above...

135
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,509
I'd like to feel a weight grow in me...

136
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,320
to end the infinity and to tie me to earth.

137
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:43,019
I'd like, at each step, each gust of wind,
to be able to say "now."

138
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,820
"Now and now"...

139
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,389
and no longer "forever" and "for eternity."

140
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,899
To sit at the empty place at a card table...

141
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,929
and be greeted, even by a nod.

142
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:01,509
Every time we participated,
it was a pretense.

143
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,940
Wrestling with one...

144
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:08,509
allowing a hip to be put out in pretense...

145
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,549
catching a fish in pretense...

146
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:14,190
in pretense sitting at tables...

147
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,250
drinking and eating in pretense.

148
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,120
Having lambs roasted and wine...

149
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,029
served in the tents out there
in the desert, only in pretense.

150
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:27,389
No, I don't have to beget a child
or plant a tree...

151
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,590
but it would be rather nice...

152
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,370
coming home after a long day...

153
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,350
to feed the cat, like Philip Marlowe...

154
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,009
to have a fever...

155
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,070
and blackened fingers from the newspaper...

156
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,549
to be excited not only by the mind...

157
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,649
but, at last, by a meal...

158
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,320
by the line of a neck...

159
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,690
by an ear.

160
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,759
To lie!

161
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,399
Through one's teeth.

162
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,200
As you're walking,
to feel your bones moving along.

163
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:07,269
At last to guess, instead of always knowing.

164
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,679
To be able to say "ah" and "oh" and "hey"...

165
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,470
instead of "yea" and "amen."

166
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,919
To be able, once in a while,
to enthuse for evil.

167
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,049
To draw all the demons
of the earth from passers-by...

168
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,799
and to chase them out into the world!

169
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,190
To be a savage.

170
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,029
Or at last to feel how it is...

171
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,570
to take off shoes under a table...

172
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,529
to wriggle your toes barefoot, like that.

173
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,009
Stay alone!

174
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,580
Let things happen!

175
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,720
Keep serious!

176
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:55,740
We can only be savages
in as much as we keep serious.

177
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:01,389
Do no more than look!
Assemble, testify, preserve!

178
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,559
Remain spirit!

179
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,730
Keep your distance. Keep your word.

180
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,330
Look, a convertible!

181
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,340
You don't buy that!

182
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,970
You steal it, if not it's stolen from you.

183
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,539
Just imagine...

184
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,610
open the roof, leave the smog behind....

185
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,120
In a pimp's jalopy.

186
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:13,130
<i>Tell me, muse, of the storyteller...</i>

187
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,809
<i>who has been thrust
to the edge of the world...</i>

188
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,140
<i>both an infant and an ancient...</i>

189
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:23,210
<i>and through him reveal everyman.</i>

190
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,430
<i>With time...</i>

191
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,690
<i>those who listened to me
became my readers.</i>

192
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,900
<i>They no longer sit in a circle...</i>

193
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,880
<i>but rather sit apart...</i>

194
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,930
<i>and one doesn't know anything
about the other.</i>

195
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,549
<i>I'm an old man...</i>

196
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,079
<i>with a broken voice...</i>

197
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,089
<i>but the tale...</i>

198
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,779
<i>still rises from the depths...</i>

199
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,180
<i>and the mouth, slightly opened, repeats it...</i>

200
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,970
<i>as clearly, as powerfully.</i>

201
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,940
<i>A liturgy...</i>

202
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:16,369
<i>for which no one needs to be initiated...</i>

203
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:20,200
<i>to the meaning of words and sentences.</i>

204
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:34,309
<i>Maybe she doesn't have the money
to see another doctor.</i>

205
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,819
<i>It's four years since I saw her...</i>

206
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,829
<i>and two that she's been ill.</i>

207
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,359
<i>When will you finally pray
with your own words...</i>

208
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,430
<i>and not for life eternal?</i>

209
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,039
<i>And these young girls
who make eyes at men.</i>

210
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:53,769
<i>So why am I living?</i>

211
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,279
<i>How will I pay, with my small pension?</i>

212
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,529
<i>You are lost,
but it can go on for a long time.</i>

213
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,599
<i>Disowned by your parents,
betrayed by your wife...</i>

214
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,700
<i>your friend is in another town.</i>

215
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,240
<i>Your children only recall your stutter.</i>

216
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:32,509
<i>You could hit yourself
as you look in the mirror.</i>

217
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,869
<i>What's that?</i>

218
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
<i>What's going on?</i>

219
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,319
<i>I'm still there.</i>

220
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,849
<i>If I want it, if only I want it.</i>

221
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,529
<i>I must want it,
then I can get myself out of it again.</i>

222
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,460
<i>I let myself go.</i>

223
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:52,089
<i>I can drag myself out again.</i>

224
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,359
<i>You'd laugh if I couldn't!</i>

225
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,599
<i>Mother was right.</i>

226
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,640
Look, two marks!

227
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,269
No, it's a beer top!

228
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,789
Nonsense! Quick, let's pull it up!

229
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,049
Only 10 pfennigs.

230
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,089
<i>You Bet!</i> was great last night.

231
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,529
<i>You Bet!</i> wasn't on last night.

232
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,690
A few days ago, or a month.

233
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,799
<i>I'm all alone</i>

234
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,039
<i>just mad on my own</i>

235
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,450
<i>Three at play, that'll be the day</i>

236
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,230
<i>And they lived happily ever after.</i>

237
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,549
Marion, not like that!

238
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,220
With a swing, not with force.

239
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,160
Don't dangle there, fly!

240
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,789
You are an angel!

241
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:33,960
For heaven's sake!

242
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,079
I can't fly with these things.

243
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,049
Yes, you can.

244
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,910
It's easier with wings than without!

245
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,480
Not with these chicken feathers!

246
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,650
What did she say?

247
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,089
Those chicken wings seem to bother her.

248
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,960
Marion, just imagine you're a dove!

249
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,400
And you a bunch of sparrows!

250
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,309
What are you playing at?
Sounds like a firemen's ball!

251
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,970
That's enough!

252
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,180
Concentrate, Marion!

253
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,869
You must admit she works hard
with those chicken feathers!

254
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,589
Make an effort!

255
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,519
Make an effort.

256
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:25,990
Of course I'm making an effort!

257
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,490
What do you think I'm doing?

258
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,789
I'd have fallen on your heads long ago...

259
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:34,990
if I didn't make an effort.

260
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,000
Just a moment, please.

261
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:46,470
Hold everything.

262
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,240
We can't pay the rent or the electricity.

263
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,950
We're broke.

264
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,549
Tomorrow we pull out.

265
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,980
Caravans to winter quarters.

266
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,380
The bailiff's been.

267
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,559
This is it for the circus this year.

268
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,490
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:09,059
<i>That's it.</i>

270
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,490
<i>It's over. Not even a season.</i>

271
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,730
<i>Once again, no time to get anywhere.</i>

272
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,829
<i>Tonight is the last night
of my good old number.</i>

273
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:22,339
<i>And it's a full moon.</i>

274
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,349
<i>And the trapeze artist breaks her neck...</i>

275
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:28,339
<i>Shut up!</i>

276
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:32,589
I never imagined it like that...

277
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,319
the farewell to the circus.

278
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,289
The last evening, no one shows up,
you play like fools...

279
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,970
and I fly round the ring like a poor chicken!

280
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,609
And then I'm a waitress again.

281
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,400
<i>Moments like that, moments like now.</i>

282
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,250
<i>My circus dream,
souvenirs for 10 years from now.</i>

283
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,160
<i>Time will heal.</i>

284
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,779
<i>What if time was the illness?</i>

285
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:16,390
<i>As if sometimes
one had to lean over to go on living.</i>

286
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,190
<i>To live, a look is enough.</i>

287
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,769
<i>The circus, I'll miss it.</i>

288
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,609
<i>It's funny, I don't feel a thing.</i>

289
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,799
<i>It's the end, and I feel nothing.</i>

290
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,470
An angel passes by!

291
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,420
Another fallen angel!

292
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,849
<i>All those I've known who remain
and who will remain in my head.</i>

293
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,690
<i>It begins, it always ends...</i>

294
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,490
<i>too good to be true.</i>

295
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,930
<i>At last, outside in the city...</i>

296
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,109
<i>I'll find out who I am, who I've become.</i>

297
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,509
<i>Most of the time, I'm too aware to be sad.</i>

298
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,069
<i>I waited an eternity...</i>

299
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,109
<i>to hear a loving word.</i>

300
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,750
<i>Then I went abroad.</i>

301
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,650
<i>Someone who'd say,
"I love you so much today."</i>

302
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,420
<i>That would be wonderful.</i>

303
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,789
<i>I just lift my head...</i>

304
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:29,029
<i>and the world appears before my eyes...</i>

305
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,829
<i>and fills my heart.</i>

306
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,440
<i>As a child...</i>

307
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,039
<i>I wanted to live on an island.</i>

308
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,250
<i>A woman alone, gloriously alone.</i>

309
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:50,890
<i>That's it.</i>

310
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,269
<i>Emptied, incompatible.</i>

311
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:11,829
<i>Fear.</i>

312
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:26,519
<i>The look of a small animal, lost in a wood.</i>

313
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,819
<i>Who are you? I don't know anymore.</i>

314
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,430
<i>Just that I won't be a trapeze artist anymore.</i>

315
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,400
<i>Don't cry.</i>

316
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,779
<i>That's how it is, shit happens.</i>

317
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,890
<i>It's not always as you'd like.</i>

318
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,220
<i>Emptiness.</i>

319
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:52,740
<i>Not think anymore.</i>

320
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:55,250
<i>Just simply be there.</i>

321
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,009
<i>Berlin!</i>

322
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,720
<i>Here I'm a foreigner, yet it's all so familiar.</i>

323
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:07,089
<i>Anyway I can't get lost,
You always end up at the Wall.</i>

324
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,289
<i>I'll wait for a photo by the photomat...</i>

325
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:13,529
<i>I'll come out with another face.</i>

326
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,670
<i>That will be the start of a story.</i>

327
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,200
<i>The faces.</i>

328
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,839
<i>I want to see faces.</i>

329
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,609
<i>Maybe I'll get a job as a waitress.</i>

330
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:41,690
<i>This evening scares me, it's silly.</i>

331
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,559
<i>Anxiety makes me sick.</i>

332
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,400
<i>Only part of me worries,
but the other doesn't believe in it.</i>

333
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,500
<i>How should I live?</i>

334
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,680
<i>Maybe that's not the question.</i>

335
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,640
<i>How should I think?</i>

336
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,990
<i>I know so little.</i>

337
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,619
<i>Maybe because I'm too curious.</i>

338
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,920
<i>I often think so wrongly...</i>

339
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,730
<i>because I think
as if I was talking to someone else.</i>

340
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:29,400
<i>Inside closed eyes...</i>

341
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,539
<i>close your eyes again.</i>

342
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,009
<i>Then even the stones come alive.</i>

343
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,750
<i>Be close to the colors!</i>

344
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,119
<i>The colors.</i>

345
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,090
<i>Neon lights in the evening sky.</i>

346
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,199
<i>the red and yellow S-Bahn.</i>

347
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,539
<i>Longing.</i>

348
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,309
_

349
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:50,090
<i>Longing for a wave of love
that would stir in me.</i>

350
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,719
<i>That's what makes me clumsy...</i>

351
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,460
<i>the absence of pleasure.</i>

352
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,030
<i>Desire for love.</i>

353
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,320
<i>Desire to love.</i>

354
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,900
<i>You never saw anyone die?</i>

355
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,239
<i>I stink of gasoline.</i>

356
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,769
<i>I saw it all clearly:
the Mercedes, the pool of oil.</i>

357
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:26,650
<I>Karin, I should have told you.</i>

358
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:32,090
<i>It can't be that simple,
I've still so much to do.</i>

359
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,789
As I came up the mountain,
out of the misty valley into the sun.

360
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,329
The fire on the cattle range...

361
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,260
the potatoes in the ashes...

362
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,269
the boathouse floating in the lake.

363
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,280
The Southern Cross.

364
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:55,480
The Far East.

365
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,190
The Great North.

366
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,489
The Wild West.

367
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,460
The Great Bear Lake.

368
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,090
Tristan da Cunha.

369
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,789
The Mississippi Delta.

370
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,469
Stromboli.

371
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,610
The old houses of Charlottenburg.

372
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,539
Albert Camus.

373
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,539
The morning light.

374
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,949
The child's eyes.

375
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:41,250
The swim in the waterfall.

376
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:46,659
<i>The spots of the first drops of rain.</i>

377
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,090
<i>The sun.</i>

378
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,530
<i>The bread and wine.</i>

379
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,269
<i>Hopping.</i>

380
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,409
<i>Easter.</i>

381
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,349
<i>The veins of leaves.</i>

382
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,880
<i>The blowing grass.</i>

383
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,920
<i>The color of stones.</i>

384
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,619
<i>The pebbles on the stream's bed.</i>

385
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,690
<i>The white tablecloth outdoors.</i>

386
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,690
<i>The dream of the house in the house.</i>

387
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,829
<i>The dear one asleep in the next room.</i>

388
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,380
<i>The peaceful Sundays.</i>

389
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:31,340
<i>The horizon.</i>

390
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:35,469
<i>The light from the room in the garden.</i>

391
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,840
<i>The night flight.</i>

392
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:42,719
<i>Riding a bicycle with no hands.</i>

393
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,960
<i>The beautiful stranger.</i>

394
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,960
<i>My father.</i>

395
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,969
<i>My mother.</i>

396
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,500
<i>My wife.</i>

397
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,239
<i>My child.</i>

398
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,190
<i>The world seems to be sinking into dusk...</i>

399
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,730
<i>but I recount, as in the beginning...</i>

400
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,960
<i>in my sing-song voice which sustains me...</i>

401
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:34,099
<i>saved by the tale from present troubles...</i>

402
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,099
<i>and protected for the future.</i>

403
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,010
<i>finished with the sweeping
over the centuries...</i>

404
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,090
<i>with the going back and forth,
as in the past.</i>

405
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,000
<i>Now I think only day by day.</i>

406
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,800
<i>My heroes are no longer...</i>

407
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,469
<i>The warriors and kings...</i>

408
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,639
<i>but the things of peace...</i>

409
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:15,250
<i>equal one to the other.</i>

410
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,519
<i>The drying onions being equal...</i>

411
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:23,389
<i>to the tree trunk crossing the marsh.</i>

412
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:28,590
<i>But no one has so far succeeded...</i>

413
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,670
<i>in singing an epic of peace.</i>

414
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,539
<i>What is wrong with peace...</i>

415
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:38,840
<i>that its inspiration doesn't endure...</i>

416
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,070
<i>and that it is almost untellable?</i>

417
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,789
<i>Must I give up now?</i>

418
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:57,389
<i>If I do give up,
then mankind will lose its storyteller.</i>

419
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,800
<i>And if mankind once loses its storyteller...</i>

420
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,730
<i>then it will lose its childhood.</i>

421
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,929
<i>I cannot find the Potsdamer Platz.</i>

422
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,780
<i>Here?</i>

423
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:29,150
<i>It cannot be here.</i>

424
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,159
<i>Potsdamer Platz.</i>

425
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:37,989
<i>That's where there was the Cafe Josti.</i>

426
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,630
<i>In the afternoons I went there to chat,
then to drink a coffee...</i>

427
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,369
<i>and to watch the crowd,
having smoked my cigar...</i>

428
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:52,309
<i>at Löhse and Wolff, a renowned tobacconist.</i>

429
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,409
<i>Just about here.</i>

430
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:02,150
<i>This can't be the Potsdamer Platz.</i>

431
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:08,829
<i>And no one whom you can ask.</i>

432
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,130
<i>It was a lively place.</i>

433
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,909
<i>Tramways, horse-drawn omnibuses...</i>

434
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:25,579
<i>and two cars:
mine and that of the chocolate shop.</i>

435
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,940
<i>The Wertheim store was here, too.</i>

436
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,610
<i>And then...</i>

437
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,730
<i>suddenly, the flags appeared.</i>

438
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,050
<i>There...</i>

439
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:48,130
<i>The whole Platz was covered with them.</i>

440
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,099
<i>And the people...</i>

441
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,340
<i>weren't friendly anymore.</i>

442
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,440
<i>And the police wasn't either.</i>

443
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,570
<i>I will not give up...</i>

444
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,210
<i>as long as I have not found
the Potsdamer Platz.</i>

445
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,519
<i>Where are my heroes?
Where are you, my children?</i>

446
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,369
<i>Where are my own, the curious ones...</i>

447
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,440
<i>the first, the original ones?</i>

448
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:39,710
<i>Name me, muse, the immortal singer...</i>

449
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,690
<i>who, abandoned by those
who listened to him...</i>

450
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,320
<i>lost his voice.</i>

451
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:51,159
<i>He who, from the angel of poetry
that he was, became the poet...</i>

452
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,489
<i>ignored or mocked...</i>

453
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,530
<i>outside on the threshold of no-man's land.</i>

454
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,699
<i>20 marks, 40 marks, 80 marks.</i>

455
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,000
<i>In a week, I could have 500. Off to the south!</i>

456
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:37,670
<i>What a crazy idea to be here.
Too much traffic.</i>

457
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,210
<i>Idiot! Three times he's been this way.</i>

458
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,940
<i>I want to get out of here.</i>

459
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:47,710
<i>If anyone recognizes me,
I'll be thrown out of high school.</i>

460
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,789
<i>I need Klaus, he'd take care of me.
He'd take good care of me.</i>

461
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:57,460
<i>He was too good. That's why he's dead.</i>

462
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:10,000
<i>Are there still borders? More than ever.</i>

463
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,849
<i>Each street has its borderline.</i>

464
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:20,050
<i>Between each lot
there's a no-man's land strip...</i>

465
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,610
<i>disguised by a hedge or by a ditch.</i>

466
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,929
<i>Whoever dares will fall on booby traps...</i>

467
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,889
<i>or be hit by laser rays.</i>

468
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:34,530
<i>The trout are really torpedoes.</i>

469
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,940
<i>Every proprietor, or even tenant...</i>

470
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,369
<i>sticks up his nameplate like a coat of arms...</i>

471
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,849
<i>and studies the morning paper
as if he were a world leader.</i>

472
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:51,619
<i>The German people have divided into
as many states as there are individuals.</i>

473
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,710
<i>And these small states are mobile.</i>

474
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,750
<i>Each one takes his own with him...</i>

475
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:01,489
<i>and demands a toll
when another wants to enter.</i>

476
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:06,730
<i>A fly caught in amber, or a leather bottle.</i>

477
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,639
<i>So much for the border.</i>

478
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:15,940
<i>But one can only enter each state
with the password.</i>

479
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,469
<i>The present-day German soul
can only be conquered and governed...</i>

480
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,670
<i>by he who arrives at each small state
with the password.</i>

481
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:49,210
<i>Fortunately, no one now has that power.</i>

482
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,199
<i>So everyone migrates...</i>

483
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,110
<i>and raises his own flag all over the world.</i>

484
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,280
<i>Their children already shake their rattles...</i>

485
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,820
<i>and trail their filth around them in circles.</i>

486
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,750
-This is the book you were telling me about?
-Yeah.

487
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:09,989
-So what is it? Hitler had a double?
-Yeah.

488
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,860
-There were two Hitlers?
-Yeah.

489
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,400
-Two Hitlers?
-Not two.

490
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:16,230
-Hitler came from the east point.
-Yes.

491
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:19,929
And he died before he could land
at his home in the Alps.

492
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,639
And Goebbels got an actor to be Hitler?

493
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,340
Yes, because he doesn't want
anybody to know--

494
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,440
Let me ask you something.

495
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:32,780
This story, to me it's not too plausible.

496
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:34,820
Oh, well, I don't know.

497
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:38,050
<i>Monsieur</i> Falk, it will take another hour
before the next set.

498
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,389
Wonderful.

499
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:42,489
So it's more realistic than the film
we're making.

500
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,230
Let me explain to you.
People like detective stories.

501
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:49,500
They use any excuse
to make a detective story.

502
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:51,199
-You understand?
-Yeah.

503
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,010
It's dopey, I grant you.
But this is dopey, too.

504
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,980
Erika, come on, honey,
give me a break, please.

505
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,239
Okay, see you later.

506
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,250
I'm sorry. Hey, please, I want to talk to you.
Come here, sweetheart.

507
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,190
We have enough pictures.

508
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,019
So please, no more pictures, all right?

509
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:13,750
Oh, Helen, I'm looking for you.

510
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,880
I can't wear this fucking hat.

511
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:18,500
This is an excellent hat. It looks great.

512
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,090
-You put it on.
-Believe me.

513
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:25,929
You wear it.

514
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,300
Come on, we have other hats over here
you can find.

515
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,670
Yes, sir.

516
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,539
-All right. Just hold this. Very good.
-Thank you.

517
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,670
Now we've got some hats!

518
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:43,250
All right, now we're gonna get a hat
that fits the face.

519
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:47,159
A hat that fits the face.

520
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:52,159
-And we go over here and put.... Oh, Jesus!
-What kind of hat do you want?

521
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:53,559
How about this one?

522
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,599
I wanna look like a German.
I wanna look anonymous.

523
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,869
And I wanna look melt-into-the-crowd.

524
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,800
Not when you look like Humphrey Bogart.
Here, try that one.

525
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,710
All right. What about.... Oh, Jesus Christ!

526
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,349
-This one?
-All right.

527
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:16,010
-This here's for the opera.
-No, you look like a Jewish rabbi.

528
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,260
-Try that one.
-All right.

529
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:22,119
-This here, I'm 42nd Street.
-Here we go, there.

530
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:23,360
He's a bookmaker.

531
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,199
You know, a bookmaker?

532
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,369
What the hell is this here?

533
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,059
Come on, for Christ's sake,
get me a good hat, will you?

534
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:37,800
I'm in disguise, you see? I really
don't want to call attention to myself.

535
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,340
How about this one?

536
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,780
You know, it's ridiculous, these hats.

537
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,679
It doesn't go with the coat.
They're all gangsters' hats.

538
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:50,730
There, that's not a gangster hat.

539
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,719
This, I'm getting married.

540
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:59,159
-This is for a horse show in London.
-Try that one.

541
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,530
That one's good.

542
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:07,300
-That looks good.
-Maybe.

543
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,000
-I think that's it.
-Could be.

544
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,800
-Yeah.
-Possible.

545
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,750
Great. You look like
somebody's grandfather.

546
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,190
Charlie Chan.

547
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:28,820
"Number one son, not too clever."

548
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,659
Okay, look...

549
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,659
-it ain't great...
-It's super.

550
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:38,329
...but it'll be wonderful.

551
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,070
And you've been wonderful.

552
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,139
Olivier, that coat looks terrible.

553
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,409
<i>Colombo had no hat,
That was a hell of a costume.</i>

554
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:53,079
<i>Well, it was your own coat.</i>

555
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,489
<i>Hey, Peter, where's your raincoat?
Been cleaned and burned.</i>

556
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,050
<i>What is it? What is it, Peter?</i>

557
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,059
<i>Why does your mind stray?</i>

558
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,260
<i>Think I'll have
filet of sole meunière tonight.</i>

559
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:10,960
<i>Do Germans make meunière?</i>

560
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,559
<i>Maybe pasta, tomato sauce, and basil.</i>

561
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,969
<i>Do Germans make pasta?</i>

562
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,099
<i>It will never change.</i>

563
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,219
<i>They were elegant, those guys.</i>

564
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:28,079
<i>They had style.</i>

565
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:37,989
<i>The one thing I shall miss...</i>

566
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:41,300
<i>from the outside, from the realm of light...</i>

567
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:43,929
<i>will be the sparrows.</i>

568
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:46,559
<i>Money makes for happiness. How to live?</i>

569
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:49,710
<i>The "Man in the Golden Helmet"
is a swindle.</i>

570
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,110
<i>You're not natives. You're all refugees.</i>

571
00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:00,150
<i>I've been sitting here since this morning.</i>

572
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:02,820
<i>I'm cold and I'm bored.</i>

573
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,889
<i>Wind in the face, the first snow in the air.</i>

574
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,599
<i>Water in the gutter...</i>

575
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,960
<i>the balcony with the beautiful foreigner.</i>

576
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:18,070
<i>They could be real ones. They look like it.</i>

577
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:21,699
<i>Some stole food
from the dogs in the camps.</i>

578
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,070
<i>That would take the grin off your face.</i>

579
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,199
<i>Don't be too sure.</i>

580
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,949
<i>The Frenchman: I met him in the street.</i>

581
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,079
<i>"Berlin won't be there anymore," he said.</i>

582
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,949
<i>Constant.</i>

583
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,820
<i>The house had half gone.</i>

584
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:43,090
<i>Some of it still stood, for how long?</i>

585
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,199
<i>Yes, I can still see this woman
who was standing in the ruins...</i>

586
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,039
<i>and who was shaking the duvet.</i>

587
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,800
<i>When was that? In May, June '45.</i>

588
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,309
Excuse me, may I draw you?

589
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:07,619
Sketch you? It's all right?

590
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,059
Yes, please.

591
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:13,389
Two minutes, very fast. Don't move.

592
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,590
<i>I wonder if she's Jewish.</i>

593
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,260
<i>What a dear face!</i>

594
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,599
<i>Is it well done, what he's drawing?</i>

595
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:30,139
<i>Interesting.</i>

596
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,210
<i>What a nostril!</i>

597
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,239
<i>A dramatic nostril!</i>

598
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,610
<i>These people are extras.</i>

599
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,019
<i>Extra people.</i>

600
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,690
<i>Extras are so patient.</i>

601
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:45,650
<i>They just sit.</i>

602
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,349
<i>I'd like to see it.</i>

603
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:49,880
<i>Perhaps he'll give it to me.</i>

604
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,730
<i>Extras.</i>

605
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:54,989
<i>These humans are extras.</i>

606
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:58,099
<i>Extra humans.</i>

607
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,039
Oh, very good.

608
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:04,369
Very nice picture.

609
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,179
<i>Yellow star means death.</i>

610
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,980
<i>Why did they pick yellow?</i>

611
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:14,010
<i>Sunflowers.</i>

612
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:16,650
<i>Van Gogh killed himself.</i>

613
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:19,690
<i>This drawing stinks.</i>

614
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:23,559
<i>So what? No one sees it.</i>

615
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,869
<i>Someday you'll make a good drawing.</i>

616
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,059
<i>I hope, I hope, I hope.</i>

617
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,469
Start the action for the stuntmen.

618
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,949
Come on, boys, I want to see action now!

619
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,110
Stop, cut!

620
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,849
They're not fighting.
It looks like it was choreographed.

621
00:54:55,269 --> 00:54:58,000
I told you to hang that flag higher.
Get moving!

622
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,460
Make sure it hangs straight.

623
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:02,530
-Jerry?
-Yes, Peter?

624
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,630
Another interview. Berlin television.

625
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,230
You have some time, Peter.

626
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:11,110
I need you for a close-up afterwards,
for after the point-of-view shot.

627
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,480
All right, I'm coming fellas. We'll do it now.

628
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:17,739
Yeah, now is good.

629
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,690
<i>What is it? What is it, Peter?</i>

630
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,159
<i>"Why, if I didn't have it, I'd miss it"...</i>

631
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,199
<i>said the general to the whore.</i>

632
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,949
Come, I'll show you something else.

633
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,510
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

634
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,320
<i>it choked on spinach, peas, rice pudding...</i>

635
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,449
<i>and steamed cauliflower...</i>

636
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,559
<i>and now eats all of that,
and not just because it has to.</i>

637
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,800
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

638
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:49,530
<i>it woke up once in a strange bed...</i>

639
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,230
<i>and now time and time again.</i>

640
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:55,059
<i>Many people seemed beautiful then...</i>

641
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,940
<i>but not so many anymore, only if it's lucky.</i>

642
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,539
<i>It had a precise picture of Paradise...</i>

643
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:04,650
<i>and now can only guess at it.</i>

644
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:07,750
<i>It couldn't imagine nothingness...</i>

645
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:10,579
<i>and today shudders at the idea.</i>

646
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,630
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

647
00:58:13,769 --> 00:58:15,889
<i>it played with enthusiasm...</i>

648
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,030
<i>and now with such involvement...</i>

649
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:22,260
<i>only when it concerns its work.</i>

650
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:24,610
<i>Do you recall our first visit here?</i>

651
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:27,340
<i>History had not yet begun.</i>

652
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,460
<i>We let both mornings and evenings go by,
and we waited.</i>

653
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:36,179
<i>It was a long time
before the river found its bed...</i>

654
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:39,170
<i>and the stagnant water began to flow.</i>

655
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,929
<i>Valley of the primeval river.</i>

656
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:44,960
<i>One day, I still remember...</i>

657
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,989
<i>the glacier melted,
and the icebergs drifted to the north.</i>

658
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:55,079
<i>A tree passed by, still green,
with an empty bird's nest.</i>

659
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:59,880
Over myriad years, only the fish had leapt.

660
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:04,079
Then came the moment
when the swarm of bees drowned.

661
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,510
Some time later,
the two stags fought on this bank.

662
01:02:09,469 --> 01:02:11,489
Then the cloud of flies...

663
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:15,329
and the antlers, like branches,
flowing down the river.

664
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,269
All that ever grew again was the grass...

665
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:22,739
growing over the bodies of wild cats,
of wild boar, and buffalos.

666
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:25,139
Do you remember, one morning...

667
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:29,079
how, out of the savanna,
its forehead smeared with grass...

668
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:33,210
appeared the biped, our image,
so long awaited.

669
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,889
And its first word was a shout.

670
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:39,889
Was it "ah" or "oh"...

671
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,860
or was it merely a groan?

672
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:47,429
We were at last able to laugh
for the first time...

673
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:52,269
and through this man's shout
and the call of his followers...

674
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,210
-we learned to speak.
-A long story.

675
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,400
The sun, the lightning,
the thunder above in the sky...

676
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,380
and below, on earth,
the firesides, the leaps...

677
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,480
the round dances, the signs, the writing.

678
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:12,519
Then one of them broke through the circle
and ran straight ahead.

679
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:15,329
As long as he ran straight ahead...

680
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,570
swerving perhaps from joy...

681
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:22,900
he seemed free,
and we could laugh with him.

682
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,909
But then, suddenly...

683
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:29,539
he ran in a zigzag and stones flew.

684
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:36,750
With his flight began another story:
the story of wars.

685
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,670
It is still going on.

686
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:42,349
But the first story, too,
that of the grass, the sun...

687
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:45,690
of the leaps, and the shouts,
that still goes on.

688
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:56,429
Do you remember how one day
the highway was built...

689
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:00,730
which the next day
saw the Napoleonic retreat...

690
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:05,769
and was then paved?

691
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,940
Today it is covered with grass
and sunk like a Roman way,

692
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,780
its tank tracks, too.

693
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:20,789
But we weren't even spectators.
We've always been too few.

694
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:28,869
You really want--

695
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:32,940
To conquer a history for myself.

696
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,230
What my timeless downward look
has taught me, I want to transmute...

697
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,679
to sustain a glance...

698
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:45,210
a short shout, a sour smell.

699
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,519
<i>I've been on the outside long enough.</i>

700
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:51,889
<i>Absent long enough.</i>

701
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,250
<i>Long enough out of the world.</i>

702
01:04:54,329 --> 01:04:56,559
<i>Let me enter the history of the world.</i>

703
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,289
<i>If only to hold an apple in my hand.</i>

704
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,690
<i>Look, those feathers.</i>

705
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:04,329
<i>Look, there on the water, already vanished.</i>

706
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,840
<i>Look, the tire marks on the asphalt...</i>

707
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,139
<i>and the cigarette butt rolling.</i>

708
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:15,300
<i>The primeval river has dried up...</i>

709
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,309
<i>and only today's puddles still quiver.</i>

710
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:21,380
<i>Do away with the world behind the world!</i>

711
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,440
Hey, Jerry!

712
01:05:50,389 --> 01:05:52,980
<i>Interesting drawing problem.</i>

713
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:56,550
<i>This man has eyes like a raccoon...</i>

714
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:00,289
<i>but he has a good hat.</i>

715
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,690
<i>What dark rings under his eyes!</i>

716
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:11,630
<i>Always worried.</i>

717
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,869
<i>I wonder if the director likes my work.</i>

718
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,800
<i>They always say "Wonderful!"...</i>

719
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:20,409
<i>no matter what you do.</i>

720
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:28,519
<i>Have to buy gifts for my children.</i>

721
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,849
<i>Maybe picture frames.</i>

722
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,860
<i>Am I a better actor now than I used to be?</i>

723
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,769
<i>Only the Roman roads still lead somewhere.</i>

724
01:06:49,849 --> 01:06:53,340
<i>Only the most ancient traces lead anywhere.</i>

725
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:56,239
<i>Where is the top of the pass here?</i>

726
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,909
<i>Even the plains...</i>

727
01:06:57,989 --> 01:07:02,119
<i>even Berlin has its hidden passes...</i>

728
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,650
<i>and it's only there that begins my country...</i>

729
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,349
<i>the country of the tale.</i>

730
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:13,760
<i>Why doesn't everyone see from childhood...</i>

731
01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:17,889
<i>the passes, doors and crevices...</i>

732
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,570
<i>on the ground, and above in the sky?</i>

733
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,840
<i>If everyone saw them...</i>

734
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:29,809
<i>there would be a history
without murder or war.</i>

735
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:34,849
<i>Ten thousand times I thought about it,
but this time I'm doing it.</i>

736
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:39,590
<i>Funny I'm so calm.
Why red socks with black shoes?</i>

737
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:41,159
<i>Foggy, cold.</i>

738
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,750
<i>I put on a pullover, afraid to be cold.</i>

739
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,699
<i>Very good jacket. Was a bargain.</i>

740
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:50,059
<i>Pocket is un-sewn. She gave it to me.</i>

741
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:54,699
<i>Pebbles on the roof, I wonder why?
So it doesn't fly away or what?</i>

742
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:58,409
<i>I'd love to fly one day.</i>

743
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:02,940
<i>The plane circles over Berlin,
one day it'll crash.</i>

744
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:06,219
<i>It's really cold. My hands were always warm.</i>

745
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:09,519
<i>Really a good sign. It crackles underfoot.</i>

746
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,250
<i>How late is it? The sun's setting.</i>

747
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:16,229
<i>Logical, it's the West.
At least now I know where the West is.</i>

748
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:19,930
<i>I always took the U-Bahn to the East...</i>

749
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,489
<i>then bought 10 tickets, saved a mark.</i>

750
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:25,800
<i>The sun in my back, on the left, the star.</i>

751
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:29,430
<i>That's really good. Sun and a star.
Her little feet!</i>

752
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:33,739
<i>She hopped from one foot to the other.
She danced so sweetly.</i>

753
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:37,010
<i>We were all alone.
Has she already got my letter?</i>

754
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:40,949
<i>I don't want her to have read it.
Berlin means nothing to me.</i>

755
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:43,989
<i>Havel, is it a river or a lake?</i>

756
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:49,050
<i>The East? It's really everywhere.</i>

757
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:52,029
<i>Strange people, they're shouting.</i>

758
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,390
<i>I really don't care.</i>

759
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,829
<i>All these thoughts.</i>

760
01:08:56,909 --> 01:08:59,270
<i>I'd really rather not think anymore.</i>

761
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,359
<i>I'm going, but why?</i>

762
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,979
<i>Story? Want to hear the story?</i>

763
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,989
<i>Story of '45, Berlin, war.</i>

764
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:19,020
<i>I'm an American detective.</i>

765
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,029
<i>German-American guy hires me.</i>

766
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,789
<i>His brother's son is in Germany.</i>

767
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,159
<i>Go to Germany, find him.</i>

768
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,569
<i>Brother's dead. The family is lost.
Find the kid.</i>

769
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,430
<i>In '45?</i>

770
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:13,069
<i>I'll never make it tonight.</i>

771
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:16,260
<i>No trapeze on full moon nights.</i>

772
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,329
<i>Not the last time. The very last time.</i>

773
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,619
<i>I think I should stop this dream.</i>

774
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,289
<i>The end of the circus!</i>

775
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:27,949
<i>The end.</i>

776
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:33,350
<i>Once again, night falls in my head.</i>

777
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,590
<i>Fear.</i>

778
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,920
<i>Fear of death.</i>

779
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,720
<i>Why not death?</i>

780
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,039
<i>The only important thing sometimes...</i>

781
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:47,380
<i>is just being beautiful...</i>

782
01:11:48,949 --> 01:11:51,210
<i>or else absolutely nothing.</i>

783
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:56,609
<i>To look at oneself in the mirror
is to see oneself think.</i>

784
01:11:57,289 --> 01:11:59,079
<i>So what do you think?</i>

785
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,489
<i>I think I've still the right to be afraid...</i>

786
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,579
<i>but not to talk about it.</i>

787
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:08,289
<i>You're not yet blind...</i>

788
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,670
<i>the heart still beats.</i>

789
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,770
<i>And now you're crying.</i>

790
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:19,170
<i>You'd like to cry like a very sad little girl.</i>

791
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,659
<i>Do you know why you're crying?</i>

792
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,100
<i>For whom?</i>

793
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,239
<i>Not for me. I don't know for whom.</i>

794
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:29,279
<i>I'd like to know.</i>

795
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:31,670
<i>I know nothing.</i>

796
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,720
<i>I'm a little bit afraid.</i>

797
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:36,880
<i>It's gone.</i>

798
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,319
<i>It's gone away.</i>

799
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,829
<i>It'll come back.</i>

800
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,289
It doesn't matter.

801
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,050
<i>Just to be able to say...</i>

802
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,520
<i>like now:</i>

803
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,460
<i>"I'm happy."</i>

804
01:19:24,569 --> 01:19:26,159
<i>I've a story...</i>

805
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:29,500
<I>and I'll go on having one.</i>

806
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:33,869
<i>There it is again, my feeling of well-being...</i>

807
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:38,699
<i>as if inside my body,
a hand was softly tightening.</i>

808
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:30,430
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

809
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,560
<i>it was the time of these questions:</i>

810
01:25:35,939 --> 01:25:40,239
<i>Why am I me and why not you?</i>

811
01:25:40,939 --> 01:25:45,130
<i>Why am I here and why not there?</i>

812
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:49,939
<i>When did time begin,
and where does space end?</i>

813
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:54,779
<i>Isn't life under the sun just a dream?</i>

814
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,550
<i>Walking.</i>

815
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,710
<i>Looking and seeing.</i>

816
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:59,449
<i>I wish you were here, Grandma.</i>

817
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,149
<i>This must be the station
they told me about...</i>

818
01:27:03,529 --> 01:27:05,220
<i>with the funny name.</i>

819
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,130
<i>Not the station where the train stopped.</i>

820
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,189
<i>But the station...</i>

821
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,590
<i>where the station stopped.</i>

822
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:15,529
Isn't that Colombo?

823
01:27:15,609 --> 01:27:17,539
No, don't think so.

824
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:19,640
Not with that moth-eaten coat.

825
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:22,760
Why should he be walking
through this mud!

826
01:27:42,069 --> 01:27:45,560
SNACK BAR

827
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:57,199
I can't see you, but I know you're here.

828
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,880
I feel it.

829
01:28:02,989 --> 01:28:05,920
You've been hanging around
since I got here.

830
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,840
I wish I could see your face.

831
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:13,859
Just look into your eyes,
and tell you how good it is to be here.

832
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,119
Just to touch something.

833
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:17,529
See, that's cold.

834
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,189
That feels good.

835
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:21,689
Here.

836
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,529
To smoke...

837
01:28:23,939 --> 01:28:25,659
to have coffee.

838
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:28,600
And if you do it together, it's fantastic.

839
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:30,569
Or...

840
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,569
to draw.

841
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:36,500
You know, you take a pencil,
and you make a dark line...

842
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,409
then you make a light line.

843
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,850
And together, it's a good line.

844
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,090
But when your hands are cold...

845
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,829
you rub them together.

846
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,399
You see, that's good. That feels good.

847
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:57,060
There's so many good things.

848
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:02,300
But you're not here. I'm here.

849
01:29:03,909 --> 01:29:05,739
I wish you were here.

850
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,979
I wish you could talk to me...

851
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:13,220
because I'm a friend.

852
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:05,329
Well?

853
01:30:05,409 --> 01:30:07,569
I'm going to enter the river.

854
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:11,800
Old human expression, often heard,
that I just understood today.

855
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,409
Now or never, moment of the ford.

856
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,470
But there is no other bank,
there is only the river.

857
01:30:18,989 --> 01:30:22,180
Forward in the ford of time,
in the ford of death.

858
01:30:22,289 --> 01:30:24,909
We are not yet born, so let's descend.

859
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,989
To look is not to look from on high,
but at eye level.

860
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,960
First, I'll have a bath.

861
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,699
Then I'll be shaved...

862
01:30:34,939 --> 01:30:36,800
by a Turkish barber...

863
01:30:36,869 --> 01:30:39,699
who will massage me
down to the fingertips.

864
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:42,529
Then I'll buy a newspaper...

865
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:45,369
and read it from headlines to horoscope.

866
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:49,800
On the first day, I'll be waited upon.

867
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:53,319
For requests, ask the neighbor.

868
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:57,380
If someone stumbles over my legs,
he'll have to apologize.

869
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,890
I'll be pushed around, and I'll push back.

870
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,189
In the crowded bar,
the bartender will find me a table.

871
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:07,630
A service car will stop,
and the mayor will take me aboard.

872
01:31:07,739 --> 01:31:10,470
I'll be known to everyone,
and suspect to no one.

873
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:13,770
I won't say a word,
and will understand every language.

874
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,529
This will be my first day.

875
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,210
None of it will come true.

876
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:52,500
I'll take her in my arms.

877
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,010
And she'll take me in her arms.

878
01:32:41,899 --> 01:32:43,659
I think he's drunk.

879
01:33:09,229 --> 01:33:10,350
Let's go!

880
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,180
It's got a taste!

881
01:33:46,029 --> 01:33:48,319
Now I begin to understand!

882
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:57,729
-Is that red?
-Yes.

883
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:00,670
Have you hurt yourself?

884
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:03,000
Is today a good day?

885
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:06,609
The pipes?

886
01:34:07,149 --> 01:34:09,050
They're yellow.

887
01:34:09,289 --> 01:34:11,579
-What about him?
-He's gray-blue.

888
01:34:14,489 --> 01:34:16,750
He's orange. Ochre.

889
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:18,659
Ochre or orange?

890
01:34:19,829 --> 01:34:21,619
Yellow, red.

891
01:34:22,069 --> 01:34:23,899
-And him?
-He's green.

892
01:34:24,529 --> 01:34:27,550
-And what's that, over the eyes?
-That's blue.

893
01:34:31,069 --> 01:34:33,689
-Is it very cold today?
-Oh, it'll soon be over.

894
01:34:33,779 --> 01:34:35,829
I'd like to have a coffee.

895
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,939
You have no money?

896
01:34:44,689 --> 01:34:47,850
I'm glad that today everything's fine.

897
01:34:58,199 --> 01:34:59,529
Beautiful!

898
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:28,819
Milk and sugar?

899
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,350
Black.

900
01:36:13,409 --> 01:36:16,270
<i>When the child was a child.</i>

901
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:20,310
<i>it lived on apples and bread,
that was enough.</i>

902
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,770
<i>And it is still that way.</i>

903
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,689
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

904
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:33,260
<i>berries fell only like berries into its hand...</i>

905
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:36,329
<i>and they still do now.</i>

906
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:42,159
<i>Fresh walnuts made its tongue raw...</i>

907
01:36:43,210 --> 01:36:45,109
<i>and they still do now.</i>

908
01:36:45,739 --> 01:36:48,829
<i>Atop each mountain, it was longing...</i>

909
01:36:48,979 --> 01:36:50,810
<i>for a higher mountain.</i>

910
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,439
<i>And in each city, it was longing...</i>

911
01:36:55,619 --> 01:36:57,409
<i>for a bigger city...</i>

912
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,140
<i>and it still does.</i>

913
01:37:05,829 --> 01:37:08,689
<i>Reached in the treetop for the cherries...</i>

914
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,130
<i>as elated...</i>

915
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,550
<i>as it still is.</i>

916
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,000
<i>Was shy...</i>

917
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:19,970
<i>in front of strangers.</i>

918
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,970
<i>And it still is.</i>

919
01:37:24,949 --> 01:37:27,069
<i>Waited for the first snow...</i>

920
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,939
<i>and still waits that way.</i>

921
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:41,149
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

922
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:45,600
<i>it threw a stick, like a lance, into a tree.</i>

923
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,920
<i>And it's still quivering there today.</i>

924
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:03,550
ANTIQUES

925
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:34,470
How do I get to Akazienstrasse?

926
01:38:35,449 --> 01:38:37,310
Go up Potsdamer to Kleistpark.

927
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:39,979
Then right at Grunewald,
past Elssholz and Gleditsch.

928
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:42,850
No right turn at Goltzstrasse,
it goes to Winterfeldplatz.

929
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:44,420
Turn left, and there you are.

930
01:39:18,529 --> 01:39:20,430
Entrance reserved for the crew.

931
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,359
Extras, the other way.

932
01:39:22,569 --> 01:39:23,829
Oh, yes!

933
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:34,489
Extra.

934
01:39:34,579 --> 01:39:37,270
You look like one!
They all want autographs!

935
01:39:38,779 --> 01:39:40,140
Idiot cop!

936
01:40:05,539 --> 01:40:07,529
I'm so happy to see you.

937
01:40:08,279 --> 01:40:10,140
-How's it going?
-Fine.

938
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:14,109
You see, I expected a much taller man.
I don't know why.

939
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:17,039
-Even taller?
-Even taller.

940
01:40:18,619 --> 01:40:19,909
How long?

941
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:23,250
Minutes...

942
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:25,149
hours...

943
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:27,630
days, weeks, months.

944
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,720
Time!

945
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:33,989
Let me give you a few dollars,
just to tide you over.

946
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:35,829
I have money.

947
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,899
I sold something.

948
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:40,569
The armor?

949
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,899
Right? What did you get for it?

950
01:40:45,979 --> 01:40:47,409
Two hundred marks.

951
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:49,909
You got robbed. But that happens.

952
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:54,149
I got to tell you something.
I'm going back now 30 years.

953
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,739
New York City.

954
01:40:55,829 --> 01:40:57,949
Pawn shop, 23rd and Lex.

955
01:40:58,029 --> 01:40:59,859
The guy gave me $500.

956
01:41:05,369 --> 01:41:06,800
You were....

957
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:08,890
Yeah.

958
01:41:11,909 --> 01:41:13,300
You are....

959
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:19,170
-You, too?
-Oh, yeah.

960
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:22,010
There's lots of us.

961
01:41:22,989 --> 01:41:26,720
Mr. Falk, I've been looking for you all over.
We're ready for you now.

962
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:28,979
Okay, David, I'll be right with you.

963
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:31,050
You're not the only one.

964
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:43,329
So what're you going to do now?

965
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:45,329
There is a girl.

966
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:47,000
A girl! Good!

967
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:54,840
Hey, wait! You wanted to tell me more!

968
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:57,479
I want to know...

969
01:41:58,050 --> 01:41:59,439
everything!

970
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:03,409
That you have to find out yourself.
That's the fun of it.

971
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,430
Come on, Marion, don't worry.

972
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:18,229
It'll be all right.

973
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:21,270
I'll send you postcards of the Eiffel Tower.

974
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:24,000
See you next season!

975
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:27,109
Don't forget the Circus Alekan!

976
01:42:27,319 --> 01:42:30,109
Bye, Archie, see you next year!

977
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,609
A thousand kisses!

978
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:37,479
I'll send a little parcel. What do you want?

979
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,460
Some Camembert cheese?

980
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:44,020
<i>I couldn't say who I am,
I haven't the slightest idea.</i>

981
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:47,319
<i>I'm someone with no roots...</i>

982
01:43:48,329 --> 01:43:50,449
<i>no story, no country.</i>

983
01:43:51,329 --> 01:43:53,260
<i>And I like it that way.</i>

984
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:56,289
<i>I'm here, I'm free.</i>

985
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:59,000
<i>I can imagine anything.</i>

986
01:43:59,069 --> 01:44:00,829
<i>It's all possible.</i>

987
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:03,300
<i>I only have to raise my eyes...</i>

988
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,069
<i>and once again, I become the world.</i>

989
01:44:07,149 --> 01:44:08,310
<i>Now...</i>

990
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:10,380
<i>in this very place...</i>

991
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,880
<i>a feeling of happiness...</i>

992
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,449
<i>that I could always have.</i>

993
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:20,640
-What are you doing there?
-I'm sitting here.

994
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:22,840
Are you sad?

995
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:25,680
-Are you sick?
-Yes.

996
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:29,439
-What's the matter?
-A need.

997
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,319
Is that so?

998
01:46:33,029 --> 01:46:35,989
A double-knot is the only way
to make it hold.

999
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:45,000
A need of food perhaps, or need of drink.

1000
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:51,069
<i>She has not gone, Cassiel, I know that.</i>

1001
01:46:52,779 --> 01:46:54,300
<i>I'll find her.</i>

1002
01:46:55,079 --> 01:46:58,600
<i>Something will happen,
something important, tonight.</i>

1003
01:47:06,529 --> 01:47:10,430
<i>There are other suns
than the one up in the sky, Cassiel!</i>

1004
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:14,630
<i>In deepest night, spring will begin today.</i>

1005
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:19,399
<i>Other wings will grow
in place of the old ones.</i>

1006
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:23,100
<i>Wings that will, at last, astound me.</i>

1007
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,760
Can I have a coffee please?

1008
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:41,079
Lieutenant...

1009
01:48:41,619 --> 01:48:44,880
I bet you must know how to find people.

1010
01:48:45,229 --> 01:48:48,560
Well, I know how to look for them.
I don't always find them.

1011
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:50,789
You're looking for somebody?

1012
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:54,850
-I don't know. I just want to find someone.
-Yeah, who?

1013
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:58,319
Boy, girl, man, woman?

1014
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:00,890
Man.

1015
01:49:02,949 --> 01:49:05,069
Well, do you know his name?

1016
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:06,260
No?

1017
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:08,569
Do you know where he lives?

1018
01:49:10,989 --> 01:49:12,979
-I know nothing.
-Nothing?

1019
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,039
Well, this is a tough case.

1020
01:49:17,729 --> 01:49:19,819
I got to go. Good night.

1021
01:49:21,399 --> 01:49:23,229
-Good luck.
-Lieutenant.

1022
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:33,770
I can't see you, but I know you're here.

1023
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:36,369
I feel it.

1024
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:42,880
I wish I could see your face, because
there are so many things I want to tell you.

1025
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:45,840
I'm your friend.

1026
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:30,340
<i>One more song, and it's over.</i>

1027
01:52:30,449 --> 01:52:33,569
<i>But I'm not going to tell you about a girl.</i>

1028
01:52:34,689 --> 01:52:37,050
<i>I want to tell you about a girl.</i>

1029
01:56:33,399 --> 01:56:35,689
It must finally become serious.

1030
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,789
I've often been alone...

1031
01:56:43,069 --> 01:56:45,189
but I've never lived alone.

1032
01:56:49,979 --> 01:56:52,970
When I was with someone,
I was often happy.

1033
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:57,109
But at the same time,
it all seemed a coincidence.

1034
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,649
These people were my parents.

1035
01:56:59,789 --> 01:57:02,050
But it could have been others.

1036
01:57:03,630 --> 01:57:06,460
Why was this brown-eyed boy my brother...

1037
01:57:07,029 --> 01:57:10,590
and not the green-eyed boy
on the opposite platform?

1038
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:16,170
The taxi driver's daughter was my friend.

1039
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:22,000
But I might as well have
put my arm round a horse's neck.

1040
01:57:24,649 --> 01:57:26,369
I was with a man...

1041
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,039
in love...

1042
01:57:29,619 --> 01:57:32,380
and I might as well have left him there...

1043
01:57:32,949 --> 01:57:37,779
and gone off with the stranger
I met in the street.

1044
01:57:42,699 --> 01:57:44,600
Look at me or don't.

1045
01:57:45,869 --> 01:57:48,029
Give me your hand or don't.

1046
01:57:50,569 --> 01:57:51,619
No.

1047
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:55,100
Don't give me the hand, and look away.

1048
01:58:01,649 --> 01:58:04,010
I think tonight is the new moon.

1049
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:08,050
No night more peaceful.

1050
01:58:11,829 --> 01:58:14,390
No bloodshed in all the city.

1051
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,729
I've never played with anyone...

1052
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,859
and yet I've never opened my eyes
and thought:

1053
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:23,130
Now it's serious.

1054
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:29,439
At last it's becoming serious.

1055
01:58:33,449 --> 01:58:35,239
So I've grown older.

1056
01:58:38,949 --> 01:58:41,609
Was I the only one who wasn't serious?

1057
01:58:43,689 --> 01:58:46,310
Is it our times that are not serious?

1058
01:58:48,329 --> 01:58:50,159
I was never lonely...

1059
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:53,460
neither when I was alone, nor with others.

1060
01:58:54,069 --> 01:58:57,090
But I would have liked to be alone at last.

1061
01:58:57,439 --> 01:59:00,729
Loneliness means I'm finally whole.

1062
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:04,340
Now I can say it...

1063
01:59:04,409 --> 01:59:06,770
as tonight, I'm at last alone.

1064
01:59:08,619 --> 01:59:11,020
I must put an end to coincidence.

1065
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:19,010
The new moon of decision.

1066
01:59:20,529 --> 01:59:22,930
I don't know if there's destiny...

1067
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,930
but there's a decision.

1068
01:59:25,529 --> 01:59:26,720
Decide!

1069
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:30,590
We are now the times.

1070
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:34,399
Not only the whole town...

1071
01:59:34,479 --> 01:59:37,840
the whole world is taking part
in our decision.

1072
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:42,109
We two are now more than us two.

1073
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:44,779
We incarnate something.

1074
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:48,210
We're representing the people now...

1075
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:51,649
And the whole place is full of those...

1076
01:59:51,729 --> 01:59:54,090
who are dreaming the same dream.

1077
01:59:54,829 --> 01:59:57,189
We are deciding everyone's game.

1078
01:59:59,270 --> 02:00:00,659
I am ready.

1079
02:00:02,369 --> 02:00:03,529
Now...

1080
02:00:04,069 --> 02:00:05,619
it's your turn.

1081
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:09,369
You hold the game in your hand.

1082
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:11,329
Now...

1083
02:00:12,449 --> 02:00:13,739
or never.

1084
02:00:18,449 --> 02:00:19,880
You need me.

1085
02:00:21,819 --> 02:00:23,439
You will need me.

1086
02:00:25,829 --> 02:00:29,279
There's no greater story than ours...

1087
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:32,170
that of man and woman.

1088
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:35,529
It will be a story of giants...

1089
02:00:37,409 --> 02:00:38,800
invisible...

1090
02:00:40,010 --> 02:00:41,560
transposable...

1091
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,840
a story of new ancestors.

1092
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:50,069
Look.

1093
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:51,979
My eyes...

1094
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:56,649
they are the picture of necessity...

1095
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:01,189
of the future of everyone in the place.

1096
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:07,590
Last night...

1097
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:10,760
I dreamt of a stranger...

1098
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:16,000
of my man.

1099
02:01:17,109 --> 02:01:19,510
Only with him could I be alone...

1100
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:22,340
open up to him...

1101
02:01:23,079 --> 02:01:25,810
wholly open, wholly for him.

1102
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:30,460
Welcome him wholly into me...

1103
02:01:32,229 --> 02:01:34,659
surround him with the labyrinth...

1104
02:01:35,630 --> 02:01:37,920
of shared happiness.

1105
02:01:40,199 --> 02:01:41,489
I know...

1106
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:44,960
it's you.

1107
02:02:13,529 --> 02:02:15,250
<i>Something happened.</i>

1108
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:19,140
<i>It is still going on.</i>

1109
02:02:20,739 --> 02:02:22,229
<i>It binds me.</i>

1110
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:27,779
<i>It was true at night, and it's true in the day.</i>

1111
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,039
<i>Even more so now.</i>

1112
02:02:31,449 --> 02:02:32,880
<i>Who was who?</i>

1113
02:02:33,819 --> 02:02:37,109
<i>I was in her, and she was around me.</i>

1114
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:44,329
<i>Who in the world can claim that he was
ever together with another being?</i>

1115
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,789
<i>I am together.</i>

1116
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:51,229
<i>No mortal child was begot...</i>

1117
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:54,170
<I>but an immortal, common image.</i>

1118
02:02:55,739 --> 02:02:58,670
<I>I learned astonishment that night.</i>

1119
02:02:59,979 --> 02:03:02,100
<I>She came to take me home...</i>

1120
02:03:02,449 --> 02:03:04,500
<i>and I found home.</i>

1121
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:10,720
<i>It happened once.</i>

1122
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,689
<I>Only once, and therefore forever.</i>

1123
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:24,760
<I>The picture that we have created
will be with me when I die.</i>

1124
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:29,630
<i>I will have lived within it.</i>

1125
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:34,939
<i>First the amazement about the two of us.</i>

1126
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:38,779
<i>Amazement about man and woman...</i>

1127
02:03:39,289 --> 02:03:41,520
<i>has made a human being of me.</i>

1128
02:03:47,159 --> 02:03:48,250
<i>I...</i>

1129
02:03:49,229 --> 02:03:50,449
<I>know...</i>

1130
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,989
<i>now...</i>

1131
02:03:53,369 --> 02:03:54,590
<i>what...</i>

1132
02:03:55,239 --> 02:03:56,359
<i>no...</i>

1133
02:03:57,710 --> 02:03:58,970
<i>angel...</i>

1134
02:03:59,810 --> 02:04:01,000
<i>knows.</i>

1135
02:04:08,079 --> 02:04:11,140
<i>Name me the men, women, and children...</i>

1136
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:13,149
<i>who will look for me...</i>

1137
02:04:13,550 --> 02:04:16,880
<i>me, their storyteller...</i>

1138
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:19,279
<i>their spokesman...</i>

1139
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:22,189
<i>for they need me...</i>

1140
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:25,590
<i>more than anything in the world.</i>

1141
02:04:28,039 --> 02:04:31,270
<i>We have embarked!</i>
