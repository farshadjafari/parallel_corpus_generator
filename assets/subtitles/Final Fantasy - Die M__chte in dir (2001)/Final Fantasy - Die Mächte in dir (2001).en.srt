1
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,202
Every night, the same dream,
the same strange planet.

2
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,968
But why?

3
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,603
What are they trying to tell me?

4
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,405
It's been 34 years
since they arrived on this planet.

5
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,958
And not a day passes
that the survivors...

6
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:46,844
... forced to live in barrier cities,
do not live in fear.

7
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,085
I have vowed to end that fear.

8
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,684
I believe my dreams hold the key.

9
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:56,246
The question is, will I be
in time to save the Earth?

10
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,001
Where are you?

11
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,722
This is a restricted area.

12
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,523
Do not move!

13
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,960
-What's she doing here?
-I don't know. We're getting her out.

14
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,922
-You're coming with us.
-Behind you!

15
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:57,923
Hold it!

16
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,120
Damn. Let's move, people!

17
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:07,881
Two coming through the wall!

18
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:11,648
Hold your fire.
Those tanks are flammable!

19
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,361
Ryan, Neil, let's go!

20
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,918
-What are you doing?
-There's a life form.

21
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,518
-Not in years.
-There is now.

22
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,646
Life form or not, I'm taking you in.

23
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:32,603
Arrest me. But I'm not
leaving without that life form.

24
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,642
It's one of those days.

25
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,802
Captain, the transport won't wait
for us much longer.

26
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:56,842
-I understand that.
-It's in bad shape.

27
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:00,200
Tell me we're not
risking our necks for this plant!

28
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,326
Really, it's a weed.

29
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:05,845
-I wouldn't even call it a weed.
-I need a minute to extract it.

30
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,085
That's a minute we do not have.

31
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,519
I'm afraid he's right.

32
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:13,682
We have incoming.

33
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,528
-Captain, we need to get moving.
-Understood, sergeant.

34
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,327
-Could you hurry?
-Done.

35
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:19,763
-Captain?
-Yes, Neil?

36
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:22,039
I'm for " Iet's get out of here."

37
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,080
Duly noted.

38
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,761
Can I have this, please?

39
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,325
-We're surrounded!
-No shit!

40
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,886
-Just relax.
-We gotta get to higher ground.

41
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,326
Everyone, up top!

42
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:47,798
Go, go, go!

43
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,808
-Requesting immediate evac.
-Affirmative.

44
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,482
Up here!

45
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:06,644
-They're right behind you!
-Come on!

46
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,728
I've got you!

47
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:14,641
-You okay?
-Yeah.

48
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:17,283
All right, everybody, here they come.

49
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:53,798
You okay?

50
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,721
You're gonna be all right.

51
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,443
So, why shouldn't I arrest you?

52
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:04,328
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.

53
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:08,118
-Not without authorization.
-I don't have time for this.

54
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,559
Do you realize you risked our lives?

55
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,044
The fact of the matter is...

56
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,559
-...it was worth your men's lives.
-Your men?

57
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,361
-She thinks you're a man.
-She's an idiot.

58
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,043
-I know you're not a man.
-You're an idiot.

59
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,280
-Funny.
-I want to talk about it.

60
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,042
Did it occur to you...

61
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:28,525
...that we would've volunteered
had we been given a choice?

62
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,799
Nobody asked you to save me.

63
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:33,762
You have not changed a bit!

64
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:35,918
Gray?

65
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:46,004
Yeah. Nice to see you too.

66
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,884
-Welcome back, captain.
-We're clean.

67
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,240
-Let's make sure of that.
-I hate getting scanned.

68
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,798
It's probably worse
for us than the Phantoms.

69
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:52,479
These machines
are suspected of causing sterility.

70
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,362
I want to have
a little Neil Jr. someday.

71
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,282
-That's a spooky thought.
-Quit busting my chops?

72
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,440
Let's just do this thing.

73
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:01,764
Yes, sir.

74
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,561
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

75
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,681
Okay, next.

76
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,448
You've gained weight.

77
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,083
It's upper-body strength.
Get a girlfriend.

78
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:23,438
I'm working on it.

79
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,247
My security rating
allows me to bypass this.

80
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,366
Not today it doesn't.

81
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,963
Something's not right.

82
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,047
-About this mission? Or that woman?
-Both.

83
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,284
Next.

84
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,043
Listen, I think--

85
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:40,205
I don't care what you think.

86
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,327
You're getting scanned
just like everybody else.

87
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:51,238
Shit!

88
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:52,478
They got him.

89
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,202
There must be a mistake.

90
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,167
You came in contact
with a Phantom.

91
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,441
Administering treatment shield.

92
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:02,448
-What level?
-Blue. Code red in 3-1 l2 minutes.

93
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,448
We have to treat him.

94
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,765
Impossible. We'll transfer him
to the treatment center.

95
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,766
There's no time for that.

96
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:16,839
Get him to the table.

97
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,886
Hang in there, captain.

98
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,082
Locating pathogens.

99
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,925
Jesus, look at that thing!

100
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,923
How much time?

101
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:48,606
Not enough. When he reaches code red,
the shield won't hold.

102
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:51,118
Engaging bio-etheric laser.

103
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:09,803
-What?
-Where'd it go?

104
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,237
What is going on?

105
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:14,481
We've lost contact.
Infestation is moving deeper.

106
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,566
-Tracking.
-There's no time.

107
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,602
-Tracking.
-You'll lose him!

108
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,439
His treatment shield is failing.

109
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,158
Found it.

110
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:34,723
Come on.

111
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,562
It's all right.

112
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:15,003
You'll be back to normal in no time.

113
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:19,718
Doctor, we need
to scan you for infestation.

114
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,525
That won't be necessary.
I'll take responsibility.

115
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,086
Hey, doc.

116
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,721
Thanks for saving him.

117
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:36,566
-Are you all right?
-The military impounded my ship.

118
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,237
-What's with her?
-What's with her and the captain?

119
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,242
What's with her and that stupid plant?

120
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,284
What?

121
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:53,837
Forward me everything regarding
the five spirits collected.

122
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,084
Yes, doctor.

123
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,168
I thought we weren't supposed to
use the "s" word.

124
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,684
Don't get smart with me.

125
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,046
Now let's see if
that plant does the trick.

126
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,680
It's a match. We've found it.

127
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:18,964
Yes.

128
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,120
The sixth spirit.

129
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,599
You broke nearly every protocol.

130
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,482
How long do you think this would
have survived outside?

131
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,285
There are elements in the council and
military waiting to shut us down.

132
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:36,445
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered
this energy in the Phantoms? You.

133
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:40,881
And who proved the same energy source
existed in humans and every life form?

134
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:44,725
You. You made it possible
to harness that energy...

135
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,806
...for ovo-pacs, scanners,
the barrier.

136
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:51,560
The council knows. They trust you.
We're so close to proving it.

137
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,845
But we still need these parts.

138
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,007
Two more pieces
and we've solved the puzzle!

139
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,439
We need to be free
to find those pieces.

140
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,685
I want to show you something.

141
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,046
-What is this?
-Read.

142
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:08,798
"All life is born of Gaia
and each life has a spirit.

143
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,927
Each new spirit is housed in a body."

144
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:13,158
Go on.

145
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:17,601
"Through their experiences on Earth,
each spirit matures and grows.

146
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,204
When the physical body dies...

147
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:25,045
...the mature spirit, enriched by life
on Earth, returns to Gaia...

148
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,849
...bringing with it the experiences...

149
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,640
...enabling Gaia to live and grow."

150
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,328
It's my old diary.

151
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:36,318
I wrote that 43 years ago,
when I was the age you are now.

152
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:39,764
Dr. Sid!

153
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:43,598
Remember Galileo?
They threw him in jail because...

154
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,721
...he said the Earth was not
the center of the universe.

155
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,840
That could happen to us.

156
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,722
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.

157
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:54,966
If you have any notes
that could be used against you...

158
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:56,443
...destroy them.

159
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:59,642
-Keep them up here.
-Right.

160
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:02,522
And stay away from the captain.

161
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,085
He saves your life, you save his,
this leads to that.

162
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:07,728
I was young once.

163
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,727
Doctor, there is a war going on.

164
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,484
No one's young anymore.

165
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,647
Members of the council...

166
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,080
...could you please explain why?

167
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,645
Zeus was completed a month ago.

168
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:24,562
If we attack the meteor, we will
eliminate the Phantoms at the source.

169
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:26,441
General Hein, calm down.

170
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,561
We voted 6 to 2...

171
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,079
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon
to attack the Leonid Meteor.

172
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:35,449
We have re-convened to vote again.

173
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:39,881
I'd like to ask the director of
the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.

174
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,364
-Dr. Sid, please.
-Thank you.

175
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:46,481
The Phantoms' nest
is in the Leonid Meteor...

176
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:49,078
...that landed here 34 years ago.

177
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:53,840
What you see now are the records
of every assault on the meteor.

178
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:57,678
Physical attacks have had
utterly no effect.

179
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,717
This took place three months ago
during a full-scale bombardment.

180
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,878
Please note the Phantoms outside
the meteor are destroyed.

181
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:09,798
However, inside, many that
were dormant come to life...

182
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:14,207
...and as you see, overall
Phantom density remains the same.

183
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:17,043
The newly risen aliens respond
to the attack...

184
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:19,883
...by burrowing deeper
into the Earth.

185
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,649
This is very interesting to me...

186
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,807
...because we see
the same thing during surgery...

187
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:30,321
...when using bio-etheric lasers
on Phantom particles, do we not?

188
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,963
Yes, indeed we do.

189
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,603
The injured particles escape...

190
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:37,846
...digging themselves deeper
into a patient's body.

191
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:42,759
When we increase the laser power
to destroy these deeper particles...

192
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:46,917
...we have had incidents of
further injury to a patient...

193
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,881
...and in some cases...

194
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:50,158
...death.

195
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,366
What exactly does that mean?

196
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:54,918
It means there's a very good chance...

197
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:58,246
...the beam from the Zeus cannon
will burn the Phantoms.

198
00:21:58,529 --> 00:21:59,564
Exactly! Thank you.

199
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:04,240
However, it also means that
the beam energy may be too strong...

200
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,842
...injuring the Earth.

201
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:07,960
Injure the Earth?

202
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,160
You mean the Gaia.

203
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:13,202
-I mean--
-You mean the spirit of the Earth.

204
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,319
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.

205
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,721
Did he say what I think he said?

206
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:21,998
What are you doing?

207
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:25,007
I know what I'm doing.
Keep your mouth shut.

208
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:26,358
This is ridiculous.

209
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,401
With all due respect...

210
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:31,726
...did you come here to talk
about some Gaia theory?

211
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:34,489
To tell us that the planet is alive?

212
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,202
That it has a spirit?

213
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,088
That's a fairy tale.
We don't have time.

214
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,883
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.

215
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,203
So if I point a gun
at the Earth and fire...

216
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:51,004
...l'm not just making a hole,
I'm killing the planet.

217
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:53,245
The Gaia theory
has not been proven.

218
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:58,079
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we
still have to remove the Phantoms?

219
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:01,366
If there's a chance of success,
we should take it.

220
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:03,605
-Don't you agree?
-Of course.

221
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,164
But there is an alternative
to the space cannon.

222
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:07,438
Another method?

223
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:10,959
-A means of disabling the Phantoms.
-Please.

224
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:16,082
As we know, the aliens display
a distinct energy pattern.

225
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:20,279
It is a fact that
two opposing bio-etheric waves...

226
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,918
...placed one over the other
cancel each other out.

227
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,280
It is theoretically possible
to make a wave pattern...

228
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:28,520
...in opposition
to the Phantom energy.

229
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:31,766
We are assembling such
a wave and are near completion.

230
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,527
Members of the council...

231
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:36,766
...gathering plants and animals...

232
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:40,245
...to fight the Phantoms
is utter nonsense.

233
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:44,245
The Zeus cannon is a proven,
effective weapon.

234
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,049
It will kill Phantoms.

235
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:50,122
Can we afford to wait
for some crazy invention...

236
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:54,447
...some army of
touchy-feely plants and animals...

237
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:57,522
...that offers no evidence
that it will destroy the aliens?

238
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:58,844
There is evidence!

239
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:01,244
Our partially completed energy wave...

240
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,957
...has stopped
Phantom particles from spreading...

241
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,524
...through an infected patient.

242
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:09,761
Do you have evidence that
a terminal patient was cured?

243
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:13,001
Not cured. The wave is not complete.

244
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:17,566
We've succeeded in containing the
particles safely inside the patient.

245
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,604
Where is the proof?

246
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:22,364
Here.

247
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:39,039
You may have bought us some time,
but at what cost?

248
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:42,440
I can't keep hiding
while you protect me.

249
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:45,483
I want what life I have left
to mean something.

250
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:48,999
When we find
the seventh and eighth spirits--

251
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:52,042
If we find them.
What we need now is luck.

252
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:54,968
Luck has nothing to do with it.

253
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,478
Faith and hard work, girl...

254
00:24:57,689 --> 00:25:01,045
...because I'll be damned
if you're going to die before me.

255
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:31,240
The council decided to postpone
firing the Zeus cannon.

256
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,320
I guess I put on a good show.

257
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:34,962
Mind if I tag along?

258
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,046
You'll probably get bored.

259
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:51,200
So, what are you doing?

260
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,205
Oh, I see. You're giving me
the silent treatment.

261
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:00,606
I'm scanning the city
for the seventh spirit.

262
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:13,238
Hurry up, Neil.

263
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,719
-Almost got it.
-What are you doing?

264
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,079
We're gonna strand them for a while.

265
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,487
Hey, it was his idea.

266
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:22,042
This was your idea?

267
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,046
We're just helping the captain out.

268
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,967
Where's your sense of romance?

269
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,637
You've seen how
the captain looks at her.

270
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,361
It's amore, baby.

271
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:37,487
What's going on?

272
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:39,327
It's probably just a glitch.

273
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:43,046
-Listen, Aki--
-I'm still mad at you.

274
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:45,240
-You're mad?
-Leaving your helmet on.

275
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:48,561
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a bit childish?

276
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:52,842
I was upset when you left for
the Zeus Station without a word.

277
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,007
-Now you know what was going on.
-Now I know.

278
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:58,479
My operation had
to be done in zero grav.

279
00:26:58,689 --> 00:26:59,678
Fine.

280
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,807
I was there on a job
and you wouldn't even see me.

281
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:05,364
I was probably collecting
spirit waves.

282
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:06,968
-Now I know.
-I'm sorry!

283
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,729
Well, me too! We're both sorry.

284
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,886
Will you tell me about them?

285
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:19,602
About what?

286
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:22,004
About the spirits you've collected.

287
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:26,325
I was infected by a Phantom
during an experiment.

288
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:29,726
-Normally, no one could have survived.
-How did you?

289
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,808
Dr. Sid created a membrane around
the infection, keeping me alive.

290
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:36,477
So the first spirit wave was me.

291
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,249
-The second was a fish.
-A fish?

292
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:43,277
The third was a deer I found
in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.

293
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,527
The fourth was a bird.

294
00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:49,642
Ever tried to track a sparrow
from outer space? It's no fun.

295
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:52,488
-You'd love that.
-I would.

296
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:55,726
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.

297
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:57,647
-I thought that was number six.
-What?

298
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:59,202
You skipped one.

299
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,719
The fifth was a little girl dying
in a hospital emergency room.

300
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:10,320
I retrieved the sample
in time, but she....

301
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:17,204
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls.

302
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,968
Even the Earth.

303
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,118
I told her she wasn't dying,
but returning to the Earth's spirit...

304
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:24,762
...to Gaia.

305
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:31,283
She told me that she was ready to die.

306
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:38,847
She said I didn't have to make up
stories to make her feel better.

307
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,763
Only 7 years old and ready to die.

308
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:46,528
I'm sorry.

309
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:51,921
I have work to do. I have to find
the seventh and eighth spirits.

310
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:54,689
Don't, please.

311
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,643
You don't believe any of this, do you?

312
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,965
I just don't know, Aki.

313
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,999
Is this why you shut me out?

314
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,927
You should have told me.

315
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:12,761
I don't know
how much time I have left.

316
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:14,883
Who does?

317
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:22,523
I better get back to scanning.

318
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,797
Captain Edwards...

319
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:43,607
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from
Old New York several days ago?

320
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:46,960
-Yes, sir.
-What were your impressions of her?

321
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:50,486
She seemed very capable
and determined, sir.

322
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:54,318
You and the Deep Eyes are being
temporarily reassigned.

323
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,966
You will guard Dr. Ross
when she reenters the wasteland.

324
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,360
-Understood, sir.
-You don't understand yet, captain.

325
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:05,722
Report any aberrant behavior
in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.

326
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,123
Aberrant behavior?

327
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:12,278
She carries an alien infestation.
We don't know what it's doing to her.

328
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,798
It might affect her judgment.

329
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:17,887
They may be manipulating her.

330
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:21,923
Is the general suggesting
that Dr. Ross is a spy?

331
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:26,362
The general is wondering why
he's explaining himself to a captain.

332
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:29,368
She's had prolonged exposure
to Phantom tissue.

333
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:32,163
If this begins to manifest itself...

334
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:36,965
...she is to be placed under arrest
and transported here for observation.

335
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:41,247
It is, in fact, for her own good.

336
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:42,524
Of course, sir.

337
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:54,527
Major, send some of our men
to keep an eye on the good captain.

338
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:29,604
I'm convinced these dreams
are some form of communication.

339
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:31,720
The message still eludes me...

340
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,207
...but they're coming faster now
and that can only mean one thing.

341
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:39,482
The Phantoms inside me
are beginning to win.

342
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:42,681
Our target is 570 klicks
west of Tucson.

343
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,358
Phantom concentration?

344
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,878
Not good.
We've got big metas everywhere.

345
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:48,841
It's gonna be a real picnic.

346
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,678
Stick close. No heroics today.
Everything by the book.

347
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:54,641
By the book. Right.

348
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:04,325
If we drop energy buoys
here, here and here...

349
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:08,244
...we can acquire the target and get
out before they know we were there.

350
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:10,440
The buoys attract the Phantoms?

351
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:12,526
-Yeah.
-For a while.

352
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:24,681
You're from the 307th?
Under General Hein?

353
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:28,848
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.

354
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:59,523
Captain, rendezvous for evac at
vector 6, coordinate 279.

355
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:03,037
Roger. Stay alert for hostiles.

356
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:22,719
Looks like they've taken the bait.

357
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,686
The seventh spirit should be
just beyond that line of wreckage.

358
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:43,642
How could any living thing
survive here?

359
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,999
We'll find out soon enough.

360
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:50,328
This was
the Phantom Cleansing Mission.

361
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:52,958
It was supposed to end the war.

362
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,917
My father's in here somewhere.

363
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,884
All right.

364
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:04,247
Let's move out, people.

365
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:20,963
I'll be damned.

366
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:22,204
A survivor.

367
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:24,882
What's it doing out here?

368
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,886
Hoping for life to return.

369
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:29,961
Is that our spirit, doc?

370
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:32,838
No.

371
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,087
We're closing in on the life form.

372
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:52,077
-Distance?
-Hard to say. We're very close.

373
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,525
I don't see anything.

374
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:03,085
-You're not gonna tell me it's him?
-That's impossible.

375
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,847
It's his ovo-pac.

376
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:16,803
How? The pacs power
our weapons, the barrier cities....

377
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,681
It's just bio-etheric energy.

378
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:22,165
To create that energy we use
living tissue. Single-cell organisms.

379
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:25,042
-His backpack is the seventh spirit?
-Yes.

380
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,046
We have incoming. Captain?

381
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:28,318
Say again?

382
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:30,321
We have incoming.

383
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,366
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.

384
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,319
I need a hand! Sarge!

385
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:58,287
-Those buoys? They're not working.
-Yeah.

386
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:03,762
-Are you all right?
-Of course I am.

387
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,647
Let's get out of here!

388
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:11,125
This shouldn't be happening.

389
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,524
Something's attracting them.

390
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:15,524
Aki!

391
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:23,597
-They're closing in fast!
-Jane, take the lead.

392
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:38,957
Fire in the hole!

393
00:37:51,129 --> 00:37:52,801
Get us out of here, Neil.

394
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,360
-I'd love to, but--
-Just do it!

395
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:21,517
Okay, that's it.

396
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:24,761
That doesn't look good.

397
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,087
We have to get her to a hospital.

398
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:30,759
-You have your orders, sir.
-What the hell's going on?

399
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:34,564
Dr. Ross is to be taken
into custody now, sir.

400
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,560
Lower your weapons. That's an order!

401
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,646
We relieve you of your command.

402
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:45,278
You'll have to shoot me.

403
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:47,042
Stand down, captain!

404
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,480
Hang on, everyone!

405
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:17,922
That's enough.
Hands where I can see them.

406
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,688
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!

407
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:43,204
Neil, get us back to New York, fast!

408
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:56,527
The Deep Eyes are returning, sir.

409
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:58,242
There was an incident.

410
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:01,202
It would seem the Phantoms
were attracted to Dr. Ross.

411
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:04,521
The crew barely escaped
with their lives.

412
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,118
Captain Edwards is still in command.

413
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:08,762
Issue an order.

414
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,802
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross
placed under arrest.

415
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:15,160
All research materials pertaining
to Dr. Sid's wave theory...

416
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:16,927
...are to be confiscated.

417
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:19,927
That might not go over
well with the council.

418
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:22,438
What a tragedy that would be.

419
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:26,767
This is perfect. The good captain
has opened the door for us.

420
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:29,838
The council will be at our feet...

421
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:33,325
...thanking us for exposing
the traitors and imploring us...

422
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:35,565
...to save them from the Phantoms.

423
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:41,562
How is she, doctor?

424
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:45,639
-She is dying.
-There must be something you can do.

425
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:48,124
Aki is fighting with
only six of the spirits.

426
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,287
We'll have to implant the seventh
directly into her chest plate.

427
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,844
I think it might be damaged.

428
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:56,120
We have to repair this panel quickly.

429
00:41:57,169 --> 00:42:01,640
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.

430
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:06,686
She needs a sympathetic spirit
to help hold her in this world.

431
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:11,360
I can think of none better suited
for that task than yours, captain.

432
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,158
-I don't understand.
-You don't have to understand.

433
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:17,486
You just be with her now.

434
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,560
You keep her here with us.

435
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:12,759
Aki? Where are we?

436
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:14,766
On an alien planet.

437
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:16,527
How is that possible?

438
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:20,159
I'm not entirely sure.

439
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:21,802
You seem pretty calm.

440
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:25,126
I've been having this dream
every night for months.

441
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:26,318
Dream?

442
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:28,925
Well, whatever it is.

443
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:33,158
You're really here, aren't you?

444
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:36,203
What's happening to me?

445
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:41,040
Sid is implanting the seventh spirit
directly into your body.

446
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:43,843
Then you're my spiritual support.

447
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:46,643
Gray, how sweet of you.

448
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:51,042
Look, I don't think you realize
how serious this situation is.

449
00:43:54,169 --> 00:43:56,558
Something you should see here, sir.

450
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:06,119
And I am watching what, major?

451
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:09,639
It seems Dr. Ross has been
recording her dreams.

452
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,317
And why would I be interested in...

453
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:14,883
...her dreams?

454
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:17,445
This is it. This is our evidence.

455
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:20,322
She's under the influence
of the Phantoms.

456
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:29,041
The dreams should be all the council
needs to authorize the Zeus cannon.

457
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,480
The council is content to hide
inside this barrier...

458
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:35,123
...while the world dies
more every day.

459
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:38,002
They need a push
in the right direction.

460
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,848
Get together a group
of your most trusted men.

461
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:32,605
Why are they staring at us?

462
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,288
Not at us.

463
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:24,686
Welcome back, captain.

464
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:28,478
Is it over?

465
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,961
How is she, doctor?

466
00:46:31,169 --> 00:46:33,285
She'll be fine.
But this is temporary.

467
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:36,919
We'll need to find the eighth
and final spirit to cure her.

468
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:42,318
Aki, can you hear me?

469
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,127
I finished it.

470
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:48,081
I know what it means.

471
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:50,928
I know what the Phantoms really are.

472
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,240
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!

473
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:07,082
We have them, sir.

474
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:09,364
Sir?

475
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,005
My wife and daughter...

476
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:18,560
...were killed by Phantoms in the
San Francisco Barrier City.

477
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,646
Did I ever tell you that?

478
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:26,678
I try to imagine what
that must have been like...

479
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:30,962
...seeing everyone around you
fall over dead for no apparent reason.

480
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:35,957
And then, at the end,
feeling something next to you...

481
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:37,597
...invisible...

482
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:39,603
...touching you...

483
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:43,203
...reaching inside your body....

484
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:47,559
You've lost family, haven't you?

485
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:49,158
Yes, sir.

486
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:51,560
That's why I trust you.

487
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:53,757
All of you.

488
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:56,683
You know what must be done.

489
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:05,959
Security override.

490
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:08,809
Perimeter breach.

491
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:12,484
Major, arrest these men.

492
00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:15,927
-Take it easy.
-Stand up. Go.

493
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:19,724
You are relieved of your post.
Don't ask questions.

494
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:23,201
Reduce power to Sector 31 .

495
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,320
You realize that the Phantoms--

496
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,888
What I realize...

497
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:30,877
...is we must force the council
to take action.

498
00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:40,206
257%%% of energy pipe alpha redirected.

499
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:43,767
Lowering power output to Sector 31 .

500
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:47,841
Barrier breach in Sector 31 .
They're coming through now.

501
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,081
We can handle
a few Phantoms in a contained space.

502
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:56,719
Relax, major. When this night's over,
you're going to be a hero.

503
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:01,887
-I don't--
-But you saw it.

504
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:04,364
I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?

505
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,839
Captain, please, let her continue.

506
00:49:07,049 --> 00:49:10,678
Why do you think
we've never been able to determine...

507
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:14,882
...a relationship between the human-
sized Phantoms and the giant ones?

508
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,679
Excuse me, doc,
but what frigging relationship?

509
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,167
You got your human-sized Phantoms,
creepy caterpillary Phantoms...

510
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:25,837
...flying Phantoms and my favorite...

511
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,607
...the big, fat, giant Phantoms.

512
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:28,918
Down, boy.

513
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:31,603
If you've spent time in the field...

514
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:35,165
...you know there is no relationship.
It's like a zoo out there.

515
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:38,884
I think the giant ones are
like our whales or elephants.

516
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:43,207
But why would an invading army bring
whales and elephants along?

517
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:46,088
Unless their ship was
a crazy Noah's Ark?

518
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,958
We have always assumed
that the meteor...

519
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:52,206
...was intended as a form
of transportation. Perhaps not.

520
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:55,568
The meteor is a chunk of their planet
that got thrown into space...

521
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:56,918
...when they destroyed their world.

522
00:49:57,129 --> 00:50:01,407
But how could they survive the trip
across outer space?

523
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,042
They didn't.

524
00:50:06,689 --> 00:50:09,203
This makes a creepy kind of sense.

525
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:10,848
What do you think?

526
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:14,884
I think that explains why
we never had a chance.

527
00:50:15,169 --> 00:50:18,559
All our strategies are based
on one assumption:

528
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:21,607
That we were fighting alien invaders.

529
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:24,528
Think of the dream, Gray.
How they died.

530
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:27,448
Since then, all they've known
is suffering.

531
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,446
They're not an invading army.

532
00:50:29,649 --> 00:50:31,287
They're ghosts.

533
00:50:33,049 --> 00:50:34,243
How many Phantoms?

534
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,207
More than enough
to convince the council.

535
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:40,567
Excellent. Sound an alert.
Send a squad out to eliminate them.

536
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:43,243
Alert status. Full deployment.

537
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:45,161
I have numerous Phantom contacts!

538
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:46,768
Of course you do.

539
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:49,688
Outside of Sector 31
and moving at incredible speed.

540
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:51,607
What the hell is going on?

541
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:53,128
They're in the pipes.

542
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:55,797
They're moving with
the bio-etheric energy flow.

543
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:59,763
That's impossible. Nothing
could survive in those pipes.

544
00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:04,088
We've got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.

545
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:12,488
Oh, my God.

546
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:14,443
Hold your fire!

547
00:51:59,209 --> 00:52:00,767
What have I done?

548
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:25,167
Come on, Neil. We need a way out.
You're our man. Think.

549
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,078
These walls are titanium alloy
and the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.

550
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:32,565
It's not like I can just
wave a magic wand and....

551
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,128
-Neil, I'm impressed.
-That makes two of us.

552
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:41,287
Proceed to the nearest
evacuation facility.

553
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:43,845
Proceed to the nearest
evacuation facility.

554
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:47,325
We should proceed
to the nearest evacuation facility.

555
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:13,603
-Here they come.
-But the others! Dr. Sid!

556
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:16,004
Deep Eyes'll take care of him.

557
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:25,205
Why can we see them now?

558
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:28,646
They must be carrying
a residual charge from the barrier.

559
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:34,597
Behind you!

560
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:35,682
All aboard, captain!

561
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:41,758
We need to find my ship.

562
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:44,529
If it was towed here,
it would be in the military hangar.

563
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:46,401
That's a big " if."

564
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:56,158
Look out!

565
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:05,760
Get us onto the platform.

566
00:56:22,969 --> 00:56:24,766
Okay, now what?

567
00:56:24,969 --> 00:56:26,687
We're going through the station.

568
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,402
With all due respect--

569
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:30,565
-Excuse me, captain.
-The station.

570
00:56:30,769 --> 00:56:32,202
We're going through it.

571
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:33,848
It's the only way.

572
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:37,519
So I gather this will be
somewhat of a rough ride?

573
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:40,163
You've got a talent
for understatement.

574
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:41,802
Hang on, everybody!

575
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:06,598
Doc?

576
00:57:11,049 --> 00:57:12,164
Interesting.

577
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,879
-Anybody hurt?
-Captain.

578
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:21,444
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.

579
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:22,918
Ouch!

580
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:24,403
-Give me a hand.
-Right.

581
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:28,522
We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools.

582
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:29,957
They're in my ship.

583
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:34,639
-No. No, doc. No drugs.
-Captain?

584
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:36,043
You heard the man.

585
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:38,242
We'll be back.

586
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,161
-I'll stay with him.
-Me too.

587
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:41,882
Nobody's staying.

588
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:44,880
-Just give me a gun.
-You got it.

589
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:47,523
Give him a weapon. Do it!

590
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:51,647
We'll be back for you.

591
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,004
You hear me?

592
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:56,361
I hear you, captain.
Now, get out of here.

593
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,123
Let's move out.

594
00:58:47,049 --> 00:58:49,279
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.

595
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:53,408
It can be used to retrieve Ryan
and bring him here.

596
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:56,646
We'll need to replace
these spent fuel cells.

597
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:59,489
There could be some live ovo-pacs
in the hangar.

598
00:58:59,689 --> 00:59:02,522
Check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.

599
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:04,560
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the Quatro.

600
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:06,964
I'll go rotate the airtray.

601
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:11,640
This city may be lost, but we are not.
Let's do this and get out.

602
00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:24,084
Be careful.

603
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:25,438
You too.

604
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,204
Oh, yeah.

605
01:00:22,249 --> 01:00:23,682
Neil, do you read me?

606
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:25,362
Loud and clear, captain.

607
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:27,327
This baby'll fly itself.

608
01:00:34,609 --> 01:00:35,837
Flight path is set.

609
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,448
Beginning rotation.

610
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:42,965
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.

611
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:45,637
An impound tractor
is attached to the ship.

612
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:47,999
Can you disengage from the cockpit?

613
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:50,962
Permission to go outside
and detach the coupling.

614
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:52,644
Do it.

615
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:05,162
There's the problem.

616
01:01:13,729 --> 01:01:16,118
The controls are locked, naturally.

617
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:22,205
You think we'll get out of here alive?

618
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:24,167
I wonder if anybody else
has gotten out.

619
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:26,805
You think anyone's made it this far?

620
01:01:27,329 --> 01:01:30,127
Will this eighth-spirit stuff
work against the Phantoms?

621
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,445
What if it's all mumbo-jumbo?

622
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:38,323
Can we stop talking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

623
01:01:50,209 --> 01:01:51,881
What's happening down there?

624
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:54,518
Nothing we can't handle.

625
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:08,927
-Neil, what's your status?
-Almost there.

626
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:10,728
Get back inside.

627
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:14,524
We're fine. Jane is negotiating
with extreme prejudice.

628
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:15,957
Talk to me, Jane.

629
01:02:17,449 --> 01:02:19,440
No problem here, captain.

630
01:02:24,729 --> 01:02:27,243
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.

631
01:03:05,689 --> 01:03:07,327
Jane, get out of there.

632
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:10,641
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!

633
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:12,726
Get the hell out of there!

634
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:41,523
The shield is powered and ready.

635
01:03:41,729 --> 01:03:43,048
-Where are you going?
-To the cockpit.

636
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:46,207
We're in countdown to liftoff.

637
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:49,680
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!

638
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:14,719
Over here, you son of a bitch!

639
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:40,403
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?

640
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:42,725
You and Sid are getting
out of here now.

641
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:46,001
-No! We can't just leave everyone.
-Everyone's dead!

642
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,963
-I'm not leaving without you.
-Sorry, but you don't have a choice.

643
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:53,248
Goodbye, Aki.

644
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:32,360
Gray, come on!

645
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:32,848
I just....

646
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:37,600
I wish I could believe
they were in a better place.

647
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:43,806
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...

648
01:10:44,009 --> 01:10:46,682
...to include an area that
we had previously overlooked.

649
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:48,607
The impact crater.

650
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:51,565
Strange place
to find the eighth spirit.

651
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:53,327
Yes, really quite astonishing.

652
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:55,759
But nothing could survive
in there except Phantoms.

653
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:57,038
Precisely.

654
01:10:57,369 --> 01:11:00,406
Which suggests that
the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.

655
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:03,681
I can't explain it at the moment,
but once we get down there...

656
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:07,040
-...you will understand--
-Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.

657
01:11:07,249 --> 01:11:10,207
Yes, I expected that's how
you would evaluate our chances.

658
01:11:10,449 --> 01:11:11,802
Well, am I wrong?

659
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:13,283
No, I agree. We probably...

660
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:16,601
...won't live long enough to extract
the eighth spirit from the crater.

661
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:18,322
Then why even try it?

662
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:20,520
Because we don't need
to extract the eighth spirit.

663
01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:22,447
If we can't bring
the final spirit here...

664
01:11:22,649 --> 01:11:25,083
...we can go there and complete
the wave inside the crater.

665
01:11:25,289 --> 01:11:26,642
Yes, exactly.

666
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,726
And how do we do that, exactly?

667
01:11:29,129 --> 01:11:30,926
I can construct a device that...

668
01:11:31,129 --> 01:11:35,247
...would attach to Aki's chest plate
to gather the eighth spirit and....

669
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:37,438
And what?

670
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:40,806
And then we wait
and see what happens.

671
01:11:41,449 --> 01:11:42,484
That's it?

672
01:11:43,129 --> 01:11:45,927
That's your plan?
We wait and see what happens?

673
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:50,328
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.

674
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:52,327
We keep scanning
the surface from orbit...

675
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:55,163
...and maybe we'll find
a compatible spirit somewhere else.

676
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:58,446
I say we go in.

677
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:29,443
What caused the barrier
to fail, General Hein?

678
01:12:31,169 --> 01:12:32,921
I'm afraid it was
only a matter of time...

679
01:12:33,129 --> 01:12:36,201
...before the Phantoms developed
an immunity to our barriers.

680
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:38,964
But I am relieved to see
that you and the council...

681
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:42,525
...were able to evacuate
to Houston without incident.

682
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:45,323
It was a terrible loss
suffered this evening.

683
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:48,441
The council has reconsidered
your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.

684
01:12:48,649 --> 01:12:49,798
I see.

685
01:12:50,169 --> 01:12:52,285
We are transmitting
the access codes to you now.

686
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:55,437
And, general...

687
01:12:56,809 --> 01:12:58,879
...best of luck to us all.

688
01:13:01,769 --> 01:13:03,202
Prepare to fire the cannon.

689
01:13:03,449 --> 01:13:04,484
The target, sir?

690
01:13:06,129 --> 01:13:07,847
The Phantom crater.

691
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,561
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.

692
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:43,567
Powering the shield.

693
01:13:46,409 --> 01:13:48,127
Okay, we're over the meteor.

694
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:49,762
Do you have it in sight, doctor?

695
01:13:50,729 --> 01:13:53,163
There are so many of them.

696
01:13:55,009 --> 01:13:55,998
Wait.

697
01:13:56,209 --> 01:14:00,168
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit
along the crater's surface.

698
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:03,721
All right.
Now let's take a closer look.

699
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:43,927
Ready to fire in three minutes.

700
01:14:44,129 --> 01:14:47,758
Ovo-pacs at maximum.
Transferring plasma flow to auto.

701
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:50,160
Counter-thrusters are engaged.

702
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:53,088
Lox flow de-coupled.
Status is green.

703
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:56,918
We have something on radar
over the impact site, sir.

704
01:14:59,009 --> 01:15:00,283
It's her.

705
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:01,598
Sir?

706
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:04,198
Just a traitor under
the influence of the enemy.

707
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:06,081
Continue the countdown.

708
01:15:06,289 --> 01:15:09,167
We'll take them all out
at the same time.

709
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:16,243
We're closing on the Phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.

710
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:18,882
Target locked.

711
01:15:19,129 --> 01:15:21,689
Ready to fire on your command.

712
01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:27,843
It's a match! It's a perfect match!

713
01:15:28,049 --> 01:15:29,767
-Scanners ready.
-Fire.

714
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:04,438
What was that?

715
01:16:04,649 --> 01:16:07,038
It's the Zeus.
They're firing on the crater.

716
01:16:07,249 --> 01:16:10,559
-Are you all right?
-A little shaken. Stand by.

717
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:15,081
Sid, the eighth spirit is not
on our scanner. Do you have it?

718
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:17,241
The eighth spirit...

719
01:16:18,169 --> 01:16:19,602
...has been destroyed.

720
01:16:20,249 --> 01:16:23,958
-What will we do now?
-Nothing. This mission is over.

721
01:16:24,249 --> 01:16:25,967
-Let's get out of here.
-Incoming!

722
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,167
What is that?

723
01:16:58,369 --> 01:17:01,566
If you're getting us out,
you better do it now.

724
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:14,038
Hold on!

725
01:17:22,969 --> 01:17:24,880
I can't hold on to you.

726
01:17:29,289 --> 01:17:31,723
Unable to maintain altitude.

727
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,963
Emergency landing procedures.

728
01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:06,158
Come in. Come in, please.

729
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:09,088
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?

730
01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:13,117
I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?

731
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:18,287
-What is that thing?
-I don't know, sir.

732
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:20,679
Incoming message, sir.

733
01:18:20,889 --> 01:18:23,278
General Hein,
cease fire immediately.

734
01:18:23,529 --> 01:18:27,647
What you're seeing is the living
spirit of an alien's home world.

735
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:30,363
Their planet was destroyed
and landed here.

736
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:33,083
This is not an invasion.
It never was.

737
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:37,527
I see. What have we been fighting
all this time? Ghosts?

738
01:18:37,729 --> 01:18:42,166
Yes. Spirits that are confused,
lost and angry.

739
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:44,963
Right. And these spirits are
coming out of this Gaia thing.

740
01:18:45,169 --> 01:18:46,727
You have to listen.

741
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:50,359
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia.
Even if I believed that...

742
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:53,322
...the Earth's under attack
from an aggressor...

743
01:18:53,489 --> 01:18:55,719
...who must be destroyed at all costs.

744
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:58,358
The cost may be
the entire planet, sir.

745
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:01,322
Firing on the alien Gaia
will only make it stronger.

746
01:19:01,569 --> 01:19:05,721
Since you're under the alien's
influence, I'll take it that we're...

747
01:19:05,929 --> 01:19:07,806
...taking the correct action.

748
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:12,321
So take your last few moments
and prepare to meet your Gaia.

749
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:15,441
Continue to fire until
the invader has been destroyed.

750
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:52,565
General, the system's overheating.

751
01:19:52,769 --> 01:19:56,523
We'll hit again and keep on hitting
it until it's dead.

752
01:19:56,809 --> 01:19:59,243
But we're not even sure
if it's having any effect.

753
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:02,680
No effect? We've got them
on the run, soldier.

754
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:06,802
This is our moment of victory.
I order you to fire.

755
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:10,604
-The system won't allow us to fire.
-We'll see about that.

756
01:20:11,769 --> 01:20:15,444
Our shield is out.
We're sitting ducks. Come on!

757
01:20:36,529 --> 01:20:38,679
This is not a good place to be.

758
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:49,607
What the hell is that?
ls it what I think it is?

759
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:50,998
Yes, it's Gaia.

760
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:53,677
This is definitely not
a good place to be.

761
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:56,838
Are you all right?

762
01:20:57,049 --> 01:21:00,564
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.

763
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:40,243
Sid, do you read me?

764
01:21:40,889 --> 01:21:42,925
Go ahead, I'm still here.

765
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:47,361
We're looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.

766
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:51,482
This explains why
the eighth spirit appeared here.

767
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:53,644
Yes.

768
01:21:54,169 --> 01:21:55,841
Yes, that's it!

769
01:21:56,049 --> 01:21:58,802
A Phantom changed
into the eighth spirit...

770
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:01,569
...at touching a life
born from our own Gaia.

771
01:22:01,849 --> 01:22:04,966
It would've gotten
a different energy signature...

772
01:22:05,169 --> 01:22:08,047
...that set it apart from
the other Phantoms.

773
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:11,361
You couldn't have
hoped for a better location...

774
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:13,645
... to find a new compatible spirit.

775
01:22:13,849 --> 01:22:18,047
Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.

776
01:22:19,049 --> 01:22:22,724
Staying where we are
isn't as easy as it sounds.

777
01:22:22,969 --> 01:22:25,039
Don't shoot any of them!

778
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:27,922
You could very well
destroy our last hope.

779
01:22:28,089 --> 01:22:31,047
What do you suggest?
Ask them to play nice?

780
01:22:31,249 --> 01:22:35,208
Combat strategy is your area
of expertise, captain, not mine.

781
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:38,798
I have a reading in the fissure.
See it?

782
01:22:39,049 --> 01:22:43,725
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.

783
01:22:43,889 --> 01:22:47,086
Well? Which one is it?
Which one?

784
01:22:47,289 --> 01:22:50,918
It's difficult to narrow down.
Just a moment, please.

785
01:22:53,249 --> 01:22:56,878
It's getting crowded in here.
Aki, we don't have time.

786
01:24:24,969 --> 01:24:27,119
With the hope of new life...

787
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:30,241
...has Gaia changed
the Phantom within?

788
01:24:36,129 --> 01:24:37,357
I have it.

789
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:46,002
Gray, get in here. I need you!

790
01:24:46,769 --> 01:24:49,681
Hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is complete.

791
01:24:49,889 --> 01:24:53,006
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.

792
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:55,962
I don't see how you
found the final spirit.

793
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:58,484
It found me, doctor.

794
01:25:00,289 --> 01:25:01,847
Oh, my word.

795
01:25:03,049 --> 01:25:06,007
I see now. I understand.

796
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:08,723
I don't understand!
What's going on?

797
01:25:08,929 --> 01:25:10,840
The ovo-pac will project the wave.

798
01:25:11,049 --> 01:25:14,166
-But we'll be defenseless.
-Just do it!

799
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:18,567
-I hope you know what you're doing.
-We'll use it to project the wave.

800
01:25:18,769 --> 01:25:22,125
Dr. Sid was right.
I have it. The eighth spirit.

801
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:23,648
I'm cured, Gray.

802
01:25:23,809 --> 01:25:26,767
-Are you sure you have it?
-Yes, I'm sure.

803
01:25:27,129 --> 01:25:30,121
-How can you know?
-Don't worry. A Phantom told me.

804
01:25:30,329 --> 01:25:31,887
Oh, great.

805
01:25:32,249 --> 01:25:34,285
That's it. Shield on.

806
01:25:39,929 --> 01:25:42,727
It's not working.
We have to do something.

807
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:45,927
If this doesn't work,
then it's already too late.

808
01:25:53,569 --> 01:25:54,968
Trust me.

809
01:26:18,849 --> 01:26:20,567
I'll blast you all to hell.

810
01:26:27,929 --> 01:26:29,487
Oh, no. No!

811
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:34,883
Get down!

812
01:26:46,889 --> 01:26:49,767
-Warning. System overload.
-I know.

813
01:26:49,969 --> 01:26:52,722
-Warning. System overload.
-I know!

814
01:26:57,929 --> 01:26:59,840
But it must be done.

815
01:27:40,809 --> 01:27:41,798
Fire.

816
01:27:42,009 --> 01:27:43,647
Fire, damn you!

817
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:45,718
Fire!

818
01:29:00,729 --> 01:29:02,845
Don't leave me, Gray.

819
01:29:04,009 --> 01:29:06,523
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.

820
01:29:07,329 --> 01:29:08,842
Looks like I was right.

821
01:29:09,209 --> 01:29:11,484
No, Gray. Hang on, please.

822
01:29:11,689 --> 01:29:13,520
I still have the wave.

823
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:15,720
We can get through this.

824
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:22,559
-We won't make it.
-We will make it.

825
01:29:22,769 --> 01:29:24,839
We both know that isn't true.

826
01:29:37,729 --> 01:29:38,923
Help me.

827
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:50,647
Listen to me.

828
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:54,842
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.

829
01:29:55,049 --> 01:29:56,721
Gray, no. Please?

830
01:29:56,929 --> 01:30:00,046
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.

831
01:30:09,609 --> 01:30:11,201
Don't leave me, Gray.

832
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:14,202
You've been saying
that death isn't the end.

833
01:30:14,449 --> 01:30:19,125
Don't back out on me
now that I finally believe.

834
01:30:30,489 --> 01:30:31,604
I love you.

835
01:32:16,649 --> 01:32:18,526
Oh, it's warm.

836
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:36,478
