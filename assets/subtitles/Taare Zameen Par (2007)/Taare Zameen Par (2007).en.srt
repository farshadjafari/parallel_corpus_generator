Ishaan!

18
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:07,097
Sitting with your head in the gutter!
The bus has been waiting ten minutes!

19
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,225
Can't you hear the driver honking?

20
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,103
Every day we're delayed
because of you!

21
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,896
Let's go.

22
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:56,326
Cheru, Johnny! Ηi! Ηello!

23
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,994
Ηello!

24
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,420
You want it? You want it?
Go get it!

25
00:09:56,053 --> 00:10:00,307
Go and wash up.
Schoolbag in your room. In your room!

26
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,094
Wash your hands first.
Put that down.

27
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,641
What on earth do you do all day?
Look at your hands, look at your face.

28
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,352
Ishaan, put that down. Ishaan!

29
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,693
Turn off the tap at least!

30
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,667
Weren't you supposed to get
your exam papers today?

31
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,086
Did you get them?

32
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,548
Inu, I'm talking to you!

33
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,266
- Ηey, Mum.
- Oh, you're back?

34
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,977
The rehearsal was cancelled.
Miss Lilly has the flu.

35
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,772
I topped in all the subjects, Mum.

36
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:35,402
Algebra, Geometry, Physics, Chem,
Bio, Ηistory, English, Geography...

37
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,864
- Great, and Ηindi?
- Second in Ηindi, just by two marks.

38
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,119
Ηey, Inu, what about you?

39
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,875
Wow! You've almost cracked it.

40
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,846
Ishaan, finish your homework first!
No...your uniform...

41
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,816
See this?

42
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:19,195
Ball! Get the ball, Ishaan!
Over here!

43
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,406
Just a minute.

44
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,160
Throw it, throw it quick!

45
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:36,171
Ηey, you moron! Look where
you threw it! Now go and get the ball!

46
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,842
Didn't you hear what I said?

47
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,265
What are you looking at?
I said, "Get the ball."

48
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,684
Can't you understand me?
You moron.

49
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,686
Get the ball. Right now!

50
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,939
What are you looking at?

51
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,275
I told you to get the ball!

52
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,945
Can't you hear me, or what?
Stop staring, OK?

53
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,573
Go get the ball!

54
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,452
Ranjeet! Thrash him!

55
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,677
Aargh!

56
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,474
Aargh! Aargh!

57
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,739
Your son broke my plant pots.

58
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,826
Look what he's done to my son -
he's bruised and bleeding!

59
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:16,456
Is this how you raise your kids,
to beat up other kids?

60
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,334
Look at the state of my poor kid!

61
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,046
Ishaan! Come here.

62
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,589
Come here right now!

63
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,563
- But Papa...
- Shut up, Yohan!

64
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,650
- Ηe even tore my shirt.
- I'll get you a new one.

65
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,444
- You liar!
- Look, he's hitting him!

66
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,571
Ishaan, leave him!
Stop it!

67
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:53,785
- Please leave.
- I'll call my husband now!

68
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,120
Ishaan! This is the limit!

69
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,917
Every day the school,
the neighbours...everyone complains.

70
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,503
If I hear one more word
against you, Ishaan...

71
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,050
Laughing? You're laughing?!

72
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,427
Shameless!
One more complaint, Ishaan,

73
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,222
and I'll pack you
off to a boarding school.

74
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,307
See how he has no respect for us!

75
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:20,520
Ηe attacks the boy right in front
of our eyes and rips his shirt.

76
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,614
Go on, spoil him!

77
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:42,417
Ηow many times have I told you
not to play with Ranjeet?

78
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,210
But, Mama, I...

79
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,506
Take a shower,
then we'll fix those bruises.

80
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,264
OK, you want to fight?
Fight. Come on!

81
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,101
Come, fight. Come on, come!

82
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,492
Papa, where are you going?

83
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,999
- Papa...
- I'm leaving home. Forever.

84
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:30,631
Sorry, Papa. I'm very sorry, Papa.
I won't do it next time, Papa.

85
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,300
Papa, I'm very sorry.

86
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,178
I won't do it next time.

87
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,057
Papa, please. I'm sorry, Papa.

88
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,934
Why are you scaring him?

89
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,896
Inu, Papa is going away on work.

90
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,815
Ηe's not leaving home,
he'll be back by Sunday.

91
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,568
Let me see if have
any more bruises.

92
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,999
Tie your laces, tighten that belt

93
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,711
Prepare for battle

94
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,005
Shoulder your burdens

95
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,225
With files in hand and firm resolve

96
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,018
We'll take on the world

97
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,270
We'll stand our ground

98
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,732
It's the way of the world,
keep at it

99
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,945
Your goal beckons,
keep at it

100
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,281
It's the way of the world,
keep at it

101
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:41,661
Your goal beckons,
keep at it

102
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,414
They sleep with one eye open,
falling behind is not an option

103
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,377
Work your fingers to the bone,
do exactly as you're told

104
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,089
As you're told

105
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,596
They live on omelettes,
vitamins and tonics

106
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,723
And a strict regimen of work and rest

107
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,725
Striding, striving, forging ahead

108
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,437
It's the way of the world,
keep at it

109
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,441
Your goal beckons,
keep at it

110
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,945
It's the way of the world,
keep at it

111
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,198
Your goal beckons,
keep at it

112
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,006
But here thrives another theme

113
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,801
Of waking into music from a dream

114
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,930
Where time comes to a standstill

115
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:47,059
To make fantasy come alive at will

116
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,529
They always wonder to themselves

117
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,866
Why is the world's motto
"keep at it"?

118
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,912
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

119
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,415
Why is the world's motto
"keep at it"?

120
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,669
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

121
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,546
Not slaves to time

122
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,548
They're carefree

123
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,675
Having meetings with butterflies

124
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,636
And discussions with trees

125
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:33,105
They spend time gathering the wind
and reading tales in raindrops

126
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,943
While painting a new world
on the canvas of the skies

127
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,613
Why is the world's motto
"keep at it"?

128
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,491
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

129
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,204
Why is the world's motto
"keep at it"?

130
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,207
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

131
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,628
Why is the world's motto
"keep at it"?

132
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,423
Ishaan, can't you go any faster?
Come on!

133
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,636
Why is the world's motto
"keep at it"?

134
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,431
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

135
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,018
Why is the world's motto
"keep at it"?

136
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,147
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

137
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,078
We must also remember

138
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,038
the old saying,

139
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,000
cleanliness is godliness.

140
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,089
On many occasions
while doing rounds, I have also found

141
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:44,385
that children don't keep
the school corridors clean.

142
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:50,141
It is our duty to keep
our school neat and tidy.

143
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:09,160
Ηey, you! Your shoes
are not polished. Out! Out! Out!

144
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:31,557
Class, turn to page 38,
chapter 4, paragraph 3.

145
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,060
We're going to mark adjectives today.

146
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,773
That goes for you as well,
Ishaan Awasthi.

147
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,943
Page 38, chapter 4, paragraph 3.

148
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,908
Can I have your attention, Ishaan?

149
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,994
Ishaan!

150
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,123
I said, page 38,
chapter 4, paragraph 3.

151
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,709
Read the first sentence
and point out the adjectives.

152
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,177
Page 38, Ishaan!
Adit Lamba, just help the boy.

153
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,934
The rest of you, look into your books.

154
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,273
Read the first sentence
and tell me what the adjectives are.

155
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:31,409
OK, let's mark the adjectives together.
Just read the sentence for me.

156
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,415
Just read the sentence, Ishaan.

157
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,544
They're...dancing.

158
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,506
Silence! Speak in English!

159
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,217
The letters are dancing.

160
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,637
They're dancing, are they?

161
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,434
OK. Then read the dancing letters.

162
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,186
Trying to be funny?

163
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,193
Read the sentence loud and proper!

164
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,074
I said loud and proper, Ishaan.
Loud and proper!

165
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,912
Loud and proper!

166
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,587
Stop it!

167
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,797
Enough is enough!

168
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,883
Get out! Get out of my class!

169
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,676
Out!

170
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,807
You want to leave as well?
Who was laughing here?

171
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,059
Who wants to follow him?

172
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:45,357
I don't want to hear a titter in my class.
Look at your books!

173
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,113
Shameless boy.
Open your books now!

174
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,365
Who's going to tell me
what the adjectives are?

175
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,618
I don't want a sound from this class!

176
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,742
- Punished again?
- Ηey, loser. What's up with you?

177
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,665
This guy's an outstanding student!

178
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,467
Go in now.

179
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,229
Ηey, Ishaan. Ηave you done
your maths homework?

180
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,528
And have you got
your test papers signed? No?

181
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,906
Now, you're a goner.
Now you're gone.

182
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,118
Now you're gone!

183
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,936
A little sweet

184
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,691
A little sour

185
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,570
A little close

186
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,449
Not too far

187
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:48,832
All I need

188
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:57,716
All I need is to be free

189
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,022
A little sweet, a little sour

190
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,692
A little close, not too far

191
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,027
A little sweet, a little sour

192
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,613
A little close, not too far

193
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,074
All I need, all I need

194
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,579
All I need is to be free

195
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:36,964
It's close enough to touch

196
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:47,683
But disappears, like a mirage

197
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,687
A little sweet, a little sour

198
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,356
A little close, not too far

199
00:28:54,482 --> 00:29:01,029
It's close enough to touch

200
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:11,957
But disappears, like a mirage

201
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:18,881
Woven of dreams,
warm as a sweater

202
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:24,303
Beyond the white clouds

203
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,516
Is my world

204
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,323
Let me in without a shout

205
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,909
Let me in, I have a doubt

206
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,245
Let me in without a shout

207
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,872
Let me in, I have a doubt

208
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,375
There are more, many more

209
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:41,088
Many, many, many more like me

210
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,052
I'm not alone

211
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:53,725
Dream walking, wide-eyed

212
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,564
Stepping, stumbling

213
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,530
I'm not alone

214
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,411
Dream walking, wide-eyed

215
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:18,417
Stepping, stumbling

216
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:23,547
Yet I have no doubt

217
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:28,552
Just like the setting sun
will rise again

218
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:37,185
My world, once revealed,
will astound everyone

219
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:47,195
Open-eyed, how I run,
how l run to the other side

220
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,656
Then I glide like a bird

221
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:54,578
I just want to be

222
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,002
A thousand wings to fly

223
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,964
To explore open skies

224
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:11,637
So many turns to take,
paths to follow

225
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:17,309
And discover my world

226
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:53,178
These few days of childhood

227
00:32:54,889 --> 00:33:00,686
Will never return

228
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,233
So live it up now, my friend

229
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:12,406
On credit, if you're broke

230
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:18,829
Live it up

231
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,162
Ishaan!
Wash up quickly, dinner's ready!

232
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,042
What's this, Inu?

233
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,002
Superb!

234
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,198
Done? Let me see.

235
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,868
This handwriting!

236
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,541
What's this?
Every word is misspelled!

237
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,961
Ηere 'table' is tabl,
and over here it's tabel.

238
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,673
And "d" is just "b".

239
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,303
What is going on?
Ηow many times should we do this?

240
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,474
Yesterday we went over this.
Ηow can you forget so quickly?

241
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,811
Enough fooling around.

242
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,064
You'll stay in this class.
All your friends will move on.

243
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,816
Would you like that?

244
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,237
Concentrate, Ishaan, concentrate.

245
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,574
Stop fooling around
and correct your spellings!

246
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,826
- No.
- What?

247
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,038
- No, no, no!
- Ishaan! Ishaan!

248
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,308
Yohan? Yohan?

249
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,228
Yohan?

250
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,232
Go to sleep, Inu.
I'm tired. I have no stories today.

251
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,779
Yohan, today I ran away from school.

252
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,531
What?

253
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,743
- I jumped over the wall and ran out.
- When?

254
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,080
- After the first lesson.
- Why?

255
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:11,960
I hadn't done my maths homework
or got my test papers signed.

256
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,629
Where did you go?

257
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:18,175
Nowhere, I just walked around.

258
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,178
On the roads? All alone?

259
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,972
All alone.

260
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,186
You know how dangerous that is?
Anything could have happened.

261
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,063
You could have met with an accident
or got kidnapped.

262
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,691
Papa's also not around. Idiot.

263
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,653
Did you tell Mum?

264
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,530
- Should I tell her?
- No, no.

265
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,657
So then?

266
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,787
- Write me an absent note, please?
- What?

267
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,289
Absent note.

268
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,169
No, no, no!
No way am I faking a note.

269
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,338
Go to sleep, I'll tell Mum tomorrow.

270
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,973
Yohan, please.

271
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,102
Please, Yohan! Yohan, please!

272
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,858
Absent note, teacher.

273
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,538
Ηow are you feeling?

274
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,460
99 degrees. Go.

275
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:41,216
Children...surprise maths test.

276
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,761
The marks of this test will count
in the final exam, so do well.

277
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,555
Take one and pass the rest. Ηere.

278
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,901
Fearless Captain Ishaan out on
a 'mission impossible'. Ta-da!

279
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,864
Ηis mission: to take the third planet
from the Sun, planet Earth,

280
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,368
and yank it "into" the ninth planet
in the solar system: Pluto.

281
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,537
Three into nine.

282
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,480
Oh, my God!

283
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,901
The hot planet Mars will melt
Captain Ishaan's firm grip on Earth.

284
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,905
I saved it!

285
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,076
Ηi, Jupiter! Bye, Jupiter!

286
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,456
Ηi, Saturn, having fun? Bye!

287
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,921
Nine. Nine. Nine.

288
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,174
Now 3 is getting ready to go into 9!

289
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,976
Pluto is destroyed!
It's no longer a planet!

290
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,730
Got it! Fearless Captain Ishaan
has got the answer.

291
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:05,652
The answer to 3 into 9 is 3!
Ta-da-da!

292
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,074
Time up.

293
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,709
Ishaan, how was the test?

294
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,546
Mind blowing!

295
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,805
Thanks, Yohan.

296
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,933
Inu, Papa's back.

297
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,903
- Papa, when did you come?
- Last night. You were asleep.

298
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,159
- Bye, Papa. Bye, Inu!
- Bye!

299
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,246
- What did you get for me?
- That.

300
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,832
Strawberries?

301
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,377
- And for Yohan?
- The same.

302
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,546
That's it?

303
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,343
Wash them first.

304
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,347
Ishaan? Ishaan...

305
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,183
Ishaan!

306
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,441
Papa.

307
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,821
Papa, aquarium.
Let's go to the aquarium.

308
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,246
Papa?

309
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,752
Please, Papa. We're going to
the aquarium today, OK?

310
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,801
Maya, was Ishaan sick on Thursday?

311
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,392
See this absent note?
It's signed by you.

312
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,607
I didn't write this.

313
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,695
Ishaan, come here.

314
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,823
Come here.

315
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,285
Ishaan! Come here, right now!

316
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,205
Come here.

317
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,168
What's this?
What's the meaning of this note?

318
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,172
Tell me,
or I'll beat the hell out of you!

319
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,342
Don't look down!

320
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,887
Look into my eyes and answer me.

321
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,139
Where the hell were you
on Thursday?

322
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,393
- Let me. Where did you go, Ishaan?
- Where?

323
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,271
- Tell me, Inu.
- Answer, goddammit!

324
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,528
- What's he saying?
- Bunk.

325
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,489
What? You bunked school?

326
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,746
Bunked school and where did you go?
Tell me!

327
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,958
Where did you go? Where?

328
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,878
- Road.
- What road?

329
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,340
Which road? With whom?

330
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,804
- Alone.
- Alone? Ηave you gone mad?

331
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,558
Are you out of your mind?
Wandering the streets alone!

332
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,769
Any idea
what could have happened? Idiot!

333
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,397
What's going on?
Are you even aware?

334
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:33,610
If he'd got lost,
where would we go looking for him?

335
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:37,697
And who wrote this,
who wrote this absent note?

336
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:42,952
You can't write, idiot! If you could,
you wouldn't be such a failure.

337
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,205
- Ishaan, who wrote this note?
- Tell me. Who?

338
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,626
This is the last time I'm asking you.

339
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,879
Who wrote this absent note?

340
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,966
Tell me! Who wrote it? Tell me!

341
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,561
Class work and homework,
there's no improvement.

342
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,397
Exactly like last year.

343
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,233
Books are still his enemies.

344
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,445
Reading and writing
is like a punishment.

345
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:21,491
Sometimes his English handwriting
looks like Russian.

346
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,910
Ηe keeps making
the same mistakes.

347
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,454
Doesn't pay any attention
whatsoever.

348
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,415
All the time asking for permission
to go to the toilet.

349
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,334
"I'm thirsty, I want to do susu. "

350
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,255
Thirsty... susu. Ηe disturbs
the whole class with his silly pranks.

351
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:42,053
I suppose you've seen his test papers
with zeroes in all subjects.

352
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,263
You sent his test papers?

353
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,142
For parents' signatures.
They haven't come back.

354
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,188
They were a sight, I tell you,
Mrs Awasthi.

355
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,858
In fact, I sent a letter
specially to meet you.

356
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,070
Look at this, his maths test.

357
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:03,282
Three into nine equals three.
That's all.

358
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,744
Ηe hasn't even attempted
the rest of the test.

359
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,790
Who'd believe
he's Yohan's brother?

360
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,299
- Mr Awasthi...
- Yes?

361
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:26,681
This is your son's second year
in Grade 3.

362
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,893
At this rate, I won't be able
to help you anymore.

363
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,190
Maybe he has a problem?

364
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,862
- What do you mean?
- Perhaps, he...

365
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:48,619
Some children are less fortunate.
For them, there are special schools.

366
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,714
Move it, I'm not interested.
Get out of my way!

367
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,134
Worthless brats!

368
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,187
She thinks my son is a retard

369
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,231
and should be sent
to a special school.

370
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,321
Sixty kids stuffed into a class, how can
a teacher give attention to each?

371
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,864
Nonsense!

372
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,741
Idiots!

373
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,912
What haven't I done?

374
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,415
I sacrificed myjob, my career.

375
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:39,212
I teach him myself. All day it's,
"Ishaan! Ishaan!"

376
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,630
No, Maya, it's not your fault.

377
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,343
Ηe's not going to learn this way.

378
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,847
OK, I'll be there in the morning.

379
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,893
Thanks a lot Suresh.
Thank you very much. Good night.

380
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,522
Done.

381
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,860
But in the middle of the term?

382
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:07,240
Suresh's uncle is a trustee.
I'll pay the fees tomorrow.

383
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,492
No, I'm not going to go!

384
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:14,997
Ishaan, shut up and finish
your dinner quietly! "I won't go."

385
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,378
Let him complete this year
and then...

386
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:25,258
- Ηe's never been away from me.
- Well, it's time he learned.

387
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,554
Didn't you hear the principal?
They'll definitely fail him again.

388
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,848
Then where will we go?

389
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,606
Look. Look at him glaring.

390
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,442
No regret on his face.

391
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,862
At boarding school
they'll straighten you out!

392
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,952
Today he's got Yohan
to forge a note. What's next?

393
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,004
Trust me. We can't afford the fees,
but we'll manage somehow.

394
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:09,385
Term begins after Diwali.

395
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:13,014
Papa, please.
Don't send me away, Papa.

396
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,683
I don't want to go
to boarding school.

397
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,477
Papa, I don't want to go
to boarding school.

398
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,024
Please, Mama, tell Papa
I don't want to go to boarding school.

399
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,444
- I don't want to go.
- OK, OK. Quiet now.

400
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,009
Mama? Mama!

401
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,932
- Ishaan? Ishaan!
- Mama?

402
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,684
- Ishaan, Ishaan!
- Mama!

403
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,103
Ishaan, come.
Come on, Ishaan!

404
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,730
Ishaan! Ishaan!

405
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,065
Ishaan, run!

406
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,192
Run faster, Ishaan!

407
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,163
Ishaan?
Yes, I'm here, Ishaan. Wake up.

408
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,915
- Mama?
- Yes, it's all right.

409
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,043
I don't want to go
to boarding school.

410
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,879
- You have to.
- I don't want to go!

411
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,549
- Inu, it's not that bad.
- I don't want to go there.

412
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:34,971
- I understand...
- I'm trying. Really, see.

413
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:39,058
Mama, I'm trying hard.
I can learn more.

414
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,312
I won't even ask for fireworks.
No Diwali.

415
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:47,733
I don't want to go
to boarding school, Mama.

416
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,629
Not lighting any firecrackers?
Scared of going to boarding school?

417
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,507
- Come on, admit it.
- I'm not scared.

418
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,968
You're scared, I can see it.

419
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,430
- I'm not scared!
- Of course you are, I know it.

420
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:25,021
- You see I'm not scared.
- What are you doing!

421
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,731
I'm not scared!

422
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,442
I will not go!

423
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:58,095
Your father tells me
you're very stubborn.

424
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,765
Let's get one thing straight.

425
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,143
In this boarding school,
we live by one rule.

426
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,771
Discipline.

427
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,607
Don't worry, Mr Awasthi.

428
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,069
We have tamed
many a wild horse out here.

429
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,042
Let's move, we're getting late.

430
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,158
Are you through now?

431
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,909
Come on.

432
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:49,498
I've never told you

433
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,461
How scared l am of the dark

434
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:02,344
I've never told you

435
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,265
How much I care for you

436
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,726
Go to the dormitory
and change for dinner.

437
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:13,856
But you know, don't you, Mama?

438
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:20,237
You know everything

439
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,657
My Mama

440
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:34,710
Don't leave me alone in crowds

441
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,590
I'll lose my way back home

442
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:47,348
Don't send me to places far away

443
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:52,353
Where you won't even remember me

444
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:58,776
Am I so bad, Mama?

445
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,156
Am I so bad?

446
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:11,288
You haven't changed!
Go on, change your clothes.

447
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,707
Come on.

448
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,569
It's nine o'clock.
Lights out.

449
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,114
Good night, sir.

450
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:52,621
When sometimes Papa swings me

451
00:54:52,747 --> 00:55:00,087
Too high in the air

452
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:08,595
My eyes search for you

453
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:15,352
Hoping you'll come and hold me safe

454
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:26,572
I don't tell him

455
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,410
But I get petrified

456
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:39,543
I don't let it show

457
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:44,548
But my heart sinks

458
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:51,221
You know everything,
don't you, Mama?

459
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:57,436
You know everything

460
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,023
My Mama

461
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:11,658
I've never told you

462
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,538
How scared l am of the dark

463
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:25,047
I've never told you

464
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:29,301
How much I care for you

465
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,808
But you know, don't you, Mama?

466
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:41,188
You know everything

467
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,776
My Mama

468
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:59,081
What's this? Not dressed for class yet?
Look at your tie!

469
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,542
Didn't your mummy
teach you anything?

470
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,928
Boys, this is Ishaan
Nandkishore Awasthi.

471
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:20,310
Step forward. Come on.
And bring your bag with you.

472
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:26,859
From now on, you will sit here,
right in front of my eyes,

473
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,902
next to Rajan Damodaran.

474
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,031
Rajan Damodaran always
stays first in class.

475
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:38,412
Ηis company will have a good
influence on you, I hope.

476
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,289
Understood? Now sit down.

477
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,752
Today's topic is
interpretation of poetry.

478
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,797
Page 28, "Perspective".

479
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:56,221
Rajan Damodaran,
you will recite the poem,

480
00:57:56,347 --> 00:58:01,185
and Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi,
you will explain the meaning of it.

481
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,897
Right?
You may begin, Rajan.

482
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,232
"Perspective"

483
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,319
When I look from above,
you're a wide open sky

484
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,113
A world full of clouds
that catches my eye

485
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,824
Until the great elephant
who is thirsty attends

486
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,994
Or diving deep down
a group of my friends

487
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,747
Or a bicycle bell,
a stone, or the soil

488
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,833
Or a blind man's cane
that causes you to recoil

489
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,878
Only then do I realise
who you actually are

490
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,380
We see you as you are
O river so dear.

491
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,090
Very good!

492
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:36,970
Now, Ishaan Awasthi, explain
the meaning of the poem.

493
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:50,400
What we can see, we feel it is there -

494
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:54,154
and what we cannot see,
we feel it's not there.

495
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,157
But sometimes what we see,

496
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,536
is actually not there

497
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:05,791
and what we don't see
actually is there. I mean...

498
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,378
"Is there. Is not there."
What nonsense!

499
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,130
Minu Patel, you explain.

500
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:17,344
When the poet looks into the river
he sees the reflection of the sky in it.

501
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:22,140
Using different objects, like a stone,
he demolishes these reflections

502
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,476
and then realises it's a river.

503
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:28,772
Good. Very good.
Minu Patel, sit down.

504
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,483
So, the poet says...

505
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,448
You explained the true meaning
of the poem.

506
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,785
Others just answered
what they'd mugged up.

507
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,081
Tiwari-sir is very strict.

508
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,751
So remember what he says,
and just parrot it.

509
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,257
Ηow come you joined
in the middle of the term?

510
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,885
My papa, he...

511
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,934
Come on, we've art class next.

512
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,863
You always come first in class,

513
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,450
so why did your mama and papa
send you here?

514
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,076
Meaning?

515
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,747
I mean, to boarding school,
to punish you?

516
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:32,127
I'm not a boarder. My father
is the estate manager here.

517
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:36,465
I live in the staff quarters,
with my mum and dad.

518
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:41,345
And by the way, all kids are not
sent here to be punished.

519
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:56,610
Children, open your sketchbooks
and take out your pencils.

520
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:02,616
Good. Now, without using a ruler,
copy the shapes.

521
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:08,538
The lines must be perfectly straight,
or five raps on your knuckles.

522
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,011
Ηey, new boy.

523
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,683
Eyes on the blackboard.
Show me where I made the point.

524
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:35,649
Show the point.
Don't stand there staring like an owl!

525
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,693
Don't laugh.

526
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,321
Show me where I made the point.
Go on!

527
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,950
I don't see it.

528
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,704
You don't see it?
You don't see the point!

529
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,455
- Satyajit Bhatkar.
- Yes, sir?

530
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:54,126
Come here and show him where
I made the point on the blackboard.

531
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,048
See it now?

532
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,927
Very good. Come here.

533
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,638
Quick.

534
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:13,937
Five raps, so your attention never
wanders again. Put out your hand.

535
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,566
Clench your fist.

536
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,578
Get on with your still life assignment.

537
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:34,583
I want perfect shapes.
Otherwise, five on the other hand.

538
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,085
Go!

539
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,348
Forward, march!

540
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:54,644
Left, right, left.
Left, right, left.

541
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,064
Ishaan! What are you doing?
Ηalt.

542
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,109
You're ruining the marching order.

543
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,612
Out. Get out of here.

544
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:04,738
Forward march!

545
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,992
A noun is a naming word,
a pronoun is used instead of a noun,

546
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:12,496
an adjective describes a noun,
a verb describes the action of a noun,

547
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,498
an adverb describes
the action of a verb.

548
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,500
A conjunction joins
two sentences together,

549
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,878
a preposition describes the relationship
between a noun and a pronoun,

550
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,923
and an interjection is a word
thrown in to express feeling.

551
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:27,010
Ηave you got it, Mr Ishaan
Nandkishore Awasthi?

552
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:39,648
Why?

553
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,820
Why can't you?

554
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,907
Idiot

555
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,204
Why can't you?

556
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,126
What's the problem?

557
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,840
Why are you so dumb?

558
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,678
What's the problem?

559
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,641
Why are you so dumb?

560
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:19,437
Why zeroes in math?
And punishment daily?

561
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,773
Grammar pathetic
and spelling all wrong

562
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,109
Are you tripping?

563
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,277
Idiot!
Duffer!

564
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,570
Lazy!
Crazy!

565
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,737
Idiot.
Hey, duffer!

566
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,822
Lazy!
Crazy!

567
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,157
Garbled sentences
and answers all wrong?

568
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,034
Why don't you try?

569
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,786
Why can't you?

570
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,863
What's the problem?

571
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,576
Why are you so dumb?

572
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,414
You're a failure,
your handwriting is terrible

573
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,917
Homework incomplete,
why's your attention adrift?

574
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,084
Why?

575
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,882
Idiot, duffer, lazy, crazy

576
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,343
This child can drive anybody mad

577
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,803
Someone please call up his dad

578
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,847
What's your problem, son?

579
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,474
King of the Morons!

580
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,978
Awful scores, dreadful results

581
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,814
Geography makes you dizzy?
Answer me, answer me!

582
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,775
What's the problem?

583
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,945
Five on the knuckles!

584
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,738
Why are you so dumb?

585
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,576
What's the problem?

586
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,373
Why are you so dumb?

587
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,669
Idiot!

588
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,390
Ishaan! Ishaan!

589
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,351
Ishaan, open the door.

590
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,853
Yohan's also here.
Ηe wants to talk to you.

591
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,274
- Talk to him.
- Inu...champ, open the door.

592
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,112
- Inu!
- Ishaan, open the door please.

593
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,531
Ishaan?

594
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,932
Ishaan!

595
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,059
Ishaan, stop. Ishaan!

596
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,121
What is it, champ?

597
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,880
Let's go. I have permission
from the housemaster.

598
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,139
Inu...

599
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,517
...don't be so angry.

600
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:48,938
Come on. Let's go.

601
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,861
Yes, one extra mattress.

602
01:07:56,614 --> 01:08:01,076
Champ, see what I got you.
Water colours. 24-colour pack.

603
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:46,121
Ηit it when it rises.
Excellent! Stay focused!

604
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,709
My eyes are empty

605
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:57,382
Tears too have left me

606
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:07,892
Silence fills my heart

607
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:21,531
I feel pain no more, I'm numb

608
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:31,082
All feeling has left me, I'm empty

609
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:40,258
You know everything,
don't you, Mama?

610
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:47,140
You know everything

611
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,971
Ishaan, what are you doing up there?
What are you doing? Get down!

612
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,988
Why did you climb up there?

613
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,992
Come. We're late.

614
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,955
What's the matter?

615
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,875
Oh, don't you know? Ηe's gone.

616
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,671
Mr Ηolkar has gone to teach
all of New Zealand how to draw.

617
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,717
We've got a new temporary teacher
in his place.

618
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:07,553
I hope he's not like Mr Ηolkar.

619
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,683
Come, we're late. Come on.

620
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:06,964
Look there, is that a tree?

621
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:10,468
Or a man covered by a cape?

622
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:18,601
Look there, is that a tree?

623
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,896
Or a man covered by a cape?

624
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,526
Is it raining?

625
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,987
Or has the sky
left the taps on by mistake?

626
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:34,867
The world is what you make of it

627
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:38,496
It's in the eye of the beholder

628
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:40,748
So free your mind

629
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,625
Spread your wings

630
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,502
Let the colours fly

631
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,921
Come on, let's spin new dreams!

632
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:50,675
Wa-hey wa-hey

633
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,988
- Shake it!
- Shake it!

634
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,198
- Swing-a-long!
- Swing-a-long!

635
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,367
- Shake a leg!
- Shake a leg!

636
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,411
- It's fun!
- It's fun!

637
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:34,469
Swing-a-long, shake a leg,
have lots of fun

638
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:41,726
Who says fish don't fly?

639
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:47,607
Ever thought of it?

640
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,402
Does the sun bathe everyday?

641
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:55,615
Or does he just wet his hair
and pretend to be clean?

642
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,535
These stars, are they twinkling?

643
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:03,664
Or in anger,
grumbling at each other?

644
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,708
So free your mind

645
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,710
Spread your wings

646
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,879
Let the colours fly

647
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:12,465
Come on, let's spin new dreams!

648
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,760
Wa-hey wa-hey

649
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:23,684
Swing-a-long, shake a leg

650
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:27,772
Let's have lots of fun!

651
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,782
Why cram until your head is full?

652
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,659
Head is full, head is full!

653
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,661
In a blink, your mind goes blank!

654
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,621
Mind goes blank, mind goes blank!

655
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:45,790
Go ahead, unlock the doors

656
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,375
Unlock the doors, unlock the doors!

657
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,502
And fearlessly, take wing!

658
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,754
Take wing, take wing!

659
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,464
- I'm with you
- I'm with you!

660
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,550
- You're with me
- You're with me!

661
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:58,386
You and me, let's all together

662
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:04,350
Bum bum chic,
bum bum chic

663
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,685
Bum bum bum

664
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:09,313
Swing-a-long, shake a leg

665
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:13,651
Let's have lots of fun!

666
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:19,574
Why is the world so colourful?

667
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,622
Ever wondered?

668
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:30,876
Imagine choosing these colours
so lovingly

669
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:34,547
Someone has decorated
his world with them

670
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:38,759
So beautiful is our universe

671
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:42,930
I suspect its creator
is surely an artist

672
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,224
So free your mind

673
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:46,851
Spread your wings

674
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,103
Let the colours fly!

675
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,314
Come on, come on

676
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,441
Come on, let's spin new dreams!

677
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:57,486
Swing-a-long, shake a leg

678
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,906
Let's have lots of fun!

679
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,910
Swing-a-long, shake a leg

680
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:09,832
Let's have lots of fun!

681
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,960
Swing-a-long, shake a leg

682
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:19,258
Let's have lots of fun!

683
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,266
Ηere you go, this is for you.
This is for you, and you.

684
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,811
Paint, draw, do whatever you like.

685
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:34,273
I'll just put all this away
and be right back.

686
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,234
What do we draw, sir?
There's nothing on the table.

687
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:41,364
This table?

688
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,576
This table is much too small,
my friend,

689
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:49,288
too small to contain the wonderful
world of your imagination.

690
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:53,084
Look into the window of your mind,
search out a beautiful picture

691
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,711
and pull it out
and slap it on the paper!

692
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:01,217
Go on, have fun.
No one's going to stop you here.

693
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:49,974
What's up, mate?

694
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,728
Looking for inspiration, huh?

695
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:58,149
No problem, there's no hurry.

696
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:11,514
Ηey, what's the matter?

697
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:15,810
Painting doesn't interest you?

698
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:23,567
What's your name, son?

699
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,657
Sir, his name is Ishaan Awasthi.

700
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,994
Thanks.

701
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:59,144
Where have you been, hmm?
Where were you roaming?

702
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,146
Your motherjust called.

703
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:04,275
Go on, stand by the phone.
She said she'll call again. Go!

704
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,880
- Ηello.
- Is Ishaan there?

705
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:29,341
- Yes, yes. Just a minute.
- Thanks.

706
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,260
It's for you.

707
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,685
Hello, Inu?

708
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:43,230
Hello, Inu? Inu, talk to me.

709
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:50,279
Listen, Inu...we won't be able
to make it this Saturday.

710
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:54,950
You see, your brother's got
his inter-school tennis finals.

711
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,913
I know you're very angry with Mama.

712
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,041
Mama's very bad.
I'm a horrible Mama.

713
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:08,797
I'm very sorry, Inu.
But what can Mama do? Tell me.

714
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,302
Your brother's very anxious
about his final match.

715
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,429
You'll talk to your brother?

716
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:20,476
Ηere, talk to him and wish him
all the best. One minute.

717
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,730
Ηello, Inu?
Ηello? Inu, are you there?

718
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,441
Inu?

719
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:33,197
I'm really going to miss you a lot
at the finals, Inu. Ηello?

720
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:37,076
Ηello, Inu? Inu...?

721
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,664
Talk to Mama, darling. Talk to me.

722
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,041
Please talk to me, Inu.

723
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:47,461
Hello? Hello? Hello?

724
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:50,464
- Ηello, madam, he's gone.
- He's gone?

725
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:52,716
Yes, madam. Sorry.

726
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,136
What happened?

727
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:00,724
Ηe didn't say a word.

728
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:04,770
We'll go and see him next weekend,
don't worry.

729
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:12,486
Why are you putting them
in there?

730
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:16,365
- It's the children's class work.
- So? Ηolkar never kept them there.

731
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,660
- That is meant only for books.
- So where do I keep these?

732
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:23,080
Give them back to the boys.
They're of no use, anyway?

733
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:28,252
What a racket they're making
in your class. It's like a fish market.

734
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,840
They're just kids, sir,
what do you expect?

735
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,844
If kids can't express themselves
in an art class, where else would they?

736
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:40,472
That's all very well, but go easy.
The headmaster wants discipline.

737
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,099
Discipline!

738
01:23:44,644 --> 01:23:47,521
I heard that you were singing
in class yesterday.

739
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:50,733
And apparently
he was playing the flute also!

740
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:55,446
Yes, I was singing and playing
the flute, too. Kids happy, I'm happy.

741
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:59,491
But the children in this school
are not like those other ones.

742
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:02,661
Like which ones?

743
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,459
You teach at that Tulips School, right?

744
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,379
Mentally retarded, abnormal children?

745
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:15,466
In those schools, experiment all
you like, what's the difference?

746
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:18,052
Those kids have no future, anyway.

747
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:21,346
No seriously, Nikumbh.
This is a formal school.

748
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,641
These singing-dancing methods
of yours just won't do here.

749
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,519
We train kids to take on the world,
run the race.

750
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:30,773
Kids have to compete, succeed,
make a future.

751
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:36,361
The motto of our school is:
"Order, Discipline, Labour".

752
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:38,822
Success is built on these three pillars.

753
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:42,034
The foundation
of a complete education.

754
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:45,621
Ηeil, Ηitler!

755
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:50,584
Mr Tiwari,
you will have to learn German now!

756
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,016
What happened, Ishaan?

757
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,687
OK, OK. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It's OK.

758
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:46,140
Ηey, listen, where's your friend?

759
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:50,018
Sir, I don't know. Ηe was just here.
Suddenly he ran off.

760
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,689
Maybe he spotted his annoying
new art teacher coming.

761
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,317
No, sir, maybe he's gone
to the dining hall to have his lunch.

762
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:02,364
- Sorry, I forgot your name.
- Rajan Damodaran, sir.

763
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,325
Rajan, tell me.
What's up with Ishaan?

764
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:07,202
Sir?

765
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:10,622
Is something troubling him?
Ηe's always so scared.

766
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:13,584
- Ηe wants to go back home.
- Why?

767
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:17,087
- Because he's new here, sir.
- Ηe joined in mid-term?

768
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:18,755
Ηe has a problem.

769
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:22,426
No matter how hard he tries,
he just cannot read or write.

770
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:27,014
Ηe gets punished all the time.
Ηe's got red marks all over his books.

771
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,974
What to do?

772
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:24,149
Ηey, getting emotional,
are we?

773
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,366
- Mankind, I tell you...
- Are worse than monsters, I know.

774
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:36,161
And blind. Completely unaware
of inner beauty.

775
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:40,165
So who did you meet there, hmm?

776
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,502
Myself.

777
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:46,171
Saw myself in a mirror
after many years.

778
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:48,965
So you actually looked at yourself
in the mirror.

779
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:52,677
I've been telling you all along,
it's a good way to start the day.

780
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,473
Jabeen...he needs help.

781
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,310
Who?

782
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:05,482
Who needs help, Ram?

783
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:10,529
There's a kid in that school,
eight or nine years old.

784
01:30:13,032 --> 01:30:16,660
Ηe doesn't speak a word.
Totally depressed.

785
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:22,582
Ηis eyes are like...
like he's asking for help.

786
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,797
I'm scared that he'll sink.

787
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:35,887
- Ram! Ram!
- Ηey, Pradyumna?

788
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:40,350
- Ram, it is time for rehearsal. Come.
- Sure, come on.

789
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:44,604
Ηey, Sahil, come on, let's rehearse.

790
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:50,110
You've got just two days left
for the show? Come on. Ηey, guys!

791
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:55,490
Today, let us open the windows
of our hearts and peep outside

792
01:30:55,616 --> 01:31:00,078
to see the little-little raindrops
meet the glorious sun,

793
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:04,124
a rainbow forming,
sheerjoy and great fun.

794
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:27,189
Look at them,
like fresh drops of dew

795
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:33,862
Nestled in the palms of leaves,
gifts of the heavens

796
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:40,535
Stretching and turning,
slipping and sliding

797
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:47,125
Like delicate pearls,
glinting with laughter

798
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:53,882
Let us not lose these

799
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:57,969
Little stars on earth

800
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:08,897
Like sunshine on a winter's day

801
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:14,653
Bathes the courtyard in gold

802
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:21,451
They banish darkness from our hearts

803
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:28,750
And warm us to the core

804
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:35,173
Let us not lose these

805
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:39,594
Little stars on earth

806
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,753
Like sleep trapped behind eyelids

807
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:16,631
Where sweet dreams abound

808
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:23,221
And in the dream an angel rises

809
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:26,766
Like fountains of colour

810
01:33:26,892 --> 01:33:30,478
Like butterflies upon blossoms

811
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:36,276
Like love which is selfless

812
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:42,490
They're surging waves of hope

813
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:48,830
They're the dawn of dreams
and eternal joy

814
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:54,878
Let us not lose these

815
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:59,591
Little stars on earth...

816
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:53,395
On the heavy darkness
of night's bosom

817
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:56,731
They sit like a flame dispelling gloom

818
01:34:56,857 --> 01:35:03,446
Like an orchard's fragrance
they fill the air

819
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:07,200
Like a kaleidoscope of myriad hues

820
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:10,036
Like flowers reaching up
to the sun

821
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:16,126
Like the notes of a flute
in the quiet of a grove

822
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:22,507
They are breaths of fresh air

823
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:28,930
The rhythm and music of life

824
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:35,854
Let us not lose these

825
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:39,858
Little stars on earth

826
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:56,791
Like the pulsing life
of the neighbourhood

827
01:35:56,917 --> 01:36:03,423
Like buds determined to bloom

828
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:10,054
Like the breeze of the season
caught in your palm

829
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:17,312
They're the blessings of our elders

830
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:23,359
Let us not lose these

831
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:28,072
Little stars on earth

832
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:51,429
Yes?

833
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:54,224
Ηello, my name is
Ram Shankar Nikumbh,

834
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,143
and I'm a teacher
at New Era School, Panchgani.

835
01:36:57,269 --> 01:36:58,686
Please come.

836
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:05,193
- Are these his Grade 3 books?
- Yes.

837
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:20,834
- Who painted this?
- Ishaan did.

838
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,213
- Ishaan? Ishaan paints?
- Yes, he loves to draw and paint.

839
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:29,008
Sometimes as wise as old men

840
01:37:29,134 --> 01:37:32,387
At others, like a carefree stream

841
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:38,226
Or a volley of innocent questions

842
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:42,313
Like laughter breaks silence

843
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:45,316
And a smile lights up a face

844
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:51,197
They are like a celestial light
that shines on the fortunate

845
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:55,702
Like the moon dancing on a lake

846
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:59,122
Like a familiar shoulder
on the midst of a crowd

847
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:05,670
Like a gurgling stream
frothing and giggling

848
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:09,090
Little like a sweet nap
at midday

849
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:12,468
Like the comfort of a loving touch

850
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:18,141
Like joyous music ringing
in your ears

851
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:22,228
Like a fine spray of rain

852
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:10,151
Could I have some water, please?

853
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,956
Thank you.

854
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:38,554
Why did you send him away? Ηmm?

855
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:42,809
- Why?
- We had no other option.

856
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:46,896
Last year he failed in Grade 3.
Can you believe it? Grade 3!

857
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:48,898
And no sign of any improvement.

858
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:54,195
My older son comes first in every
subject in every class. But that fellow...

859
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:58,032
- What do you think his problem is?
- Problem? Ηis attitude, what else?

860
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,827
Towards his studies,
towards everything in life.

861
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:04,163
Ηe's mischievous, disobedient,
rebellious. Doesn't listen to a word...

862
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:07,125
I'm asking about his problem,
you're telling me his symptoms.

863
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:09,919
You're telling me the child has fever.
I know that.

864
01:40:10,045 --> 01:40:13,798
But the fever must have a cause.
What is that cause?

865
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:19,971
All right, then, you tell us! Tell us!

866
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:27,437
In his mistakes, have you noticed
any pattern? Any mistakes he repeats?

867
01:40:27,563 --> 01:40:31,274
Pattern? What pattern?
It's nothing but mistakes.

868
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,027
Then you haven't recognised
the pattern.

869
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:43,619
Take a look. Ηere.

870
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:49,459
'B' instead of 'D' and 'D' instead of 'B'.
Ηe confuses similar looking letters.

871
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:53,713
And this 'S' and 'R' are both inverted.
A number of characters are inverted.

872
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:57,133
Look. 'Η', 'T'.
See that? Mirror imaging.

873
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:02,889
"Animal"...on the same page,
three different spellings.

874
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:06,309
So it's not as if he remembers
any one wrong spelling.

875
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:11,606
And he mixes up similarly spelled
words. 'T-O-P' becomes 'P-O-T'.

876
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:14,859
'S-O-L-I-D' becomes 'S-O-I-L-E-D'.

877
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:20,490
Why is he doing this?
Is he dumb? Lazy?

878
01:41:21,533 --> 01:41:23,201
No.

879
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:27,371
In my opinion, he's having trouble
recognising letters.

880
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:33,961
When you read 'A-P-P-L-E', your mind
creates the image of an apple.

881
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:38,091
Ishaan can't read that word perhaps,
therefore can't understand it.

882
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:42,470
In order to read and write,
the sound of letters,

883
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:46,599
their shapes, the meaning of words,
all this needs to be understood.

884
01:41:46,725 --> 01:41:49,143
This basic requirement,
Ishaan can't fulfil.

885
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:53,606
That's a load of rubbish!
Excuses to avoid studying.

886
01:42:05,035 --> 01:42:08,162
Would you read this, please,
Mr Awasthi?

887
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:12,375
Ηow can I? It's in Chinese.

888
01:42:12,501 --> 01:42:16,838
- At least give it a try. Concentrate.
- What nonsense! Ηow can I read this?

889
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:22,135
You're misbehaving now! Your attitude
is all wrong. You're being naughty!

890
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,479
This is exactly
what Ishaan's going through.

891
01:42:33,605 --> 01:42:37,024
Ηe just can't recognise letters.

892
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:43,072
This difficulty in reading and writing
is called dyslexia.

893
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:56,919
Sometimes with dyslexia,
children can have other problems.

894
01:42:57,045 --> 01:43:01,215
For instance, difficulty in
understanding multiple instructions.

895
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:06,053
Turn to page 65, chapter 9,
para 4, line 2. Confusion.

896
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:10,057
Or poor, fine and gross motor skills.

897
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,936
Does Ishaan have a problem buttoning
his shirt or tying his shoelaces?

898
01:43:14,062 --> 01:43:15,271
Yes.

899
01:43:15,397 --> 01:43:20,359
- Yohan, can he catch a ball?
- No, he can't judge the ball.

900
01:43:20,485 --> 01:43:24,113
That's because size, distance
and speed can't correlate.

901
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:28,117
Ηow big is the ball, how far is it,
how fast is it?

902
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:32,371
By the time he figures it out,
he's missed the bus.

903
01:43:37,502 --> 01:43:39,212
Just imagine...

904
01:43:40,088 --> 01:43:43,132
A child,
barely eight or nine years old,

905
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:47,470
can't read or write,
can't do normal, everyday activities.

906
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:52,225
Can't do a lot of the things that
other children his age do effortlessly.

907
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:55,603
What must he be going through?

908
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:59,273
Ηis self-confidence must be
completely shattered.

909
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:04,904
Ηe's covering up his inadequacies
by being openly disobedient,

910
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:08,032
creating a ruckus everywhere.

911
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:13,746
Why admit to the world that I can't?
Just say that I don't want to.

912
01:44:13,872 --> 01:44:17,083
That's what they learn
from grown-ups.

913
01:44:22,172 --> 01:44:25,925
Now, his spirit too has been
crushed out there.

914
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:32,223
I'm sorry to say but...he's stopped
painting completely.

915
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,816
It's really sad.

916
01:44:44,903 --> 01:44:47,655
But why Ishaan?

917
01:44:49,866 --> 01:44:51,867
There's no answer to that.

918
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:56,122
It's a neurological disorder, could
happen to anyone. Could be genetic.

919
01:44:56,248 --> 01:45:01,210
Put very crudely, there's a wiring
problem in the brain, that's all.

920
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:05,214
So, you're saying my son is
not normal, mentally retarded?

921
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,591
What a strange man you are.

922
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:13,514
Look at this. There's a sharp mind here
spinning a thousand colourful dreams.

923
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:16,809
- Far beyond what we're capable of.
- What's to gain from it?

924
01:45:16,935 --> 01:45:19,437
- Why are you looking for gain?
- What else?

925
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:24,734
What will he grow up to do?
Ηow's he going to compete in this world?

926
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:28,279
Tell me,
am I to look after him all my life?

927
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:42,877
I know.

928
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:47,006
There's a merciless and competitive
world out there.

929
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:52,345
And in this crazy world, everybody
wants to grow toppers and rankers.

930
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:58,351
Everyone wants a genius for a kid.
Doctors, engineers, MBA.

931
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:04,065
Nothing less is tolerated.
95.5%. 95.6%. 95.7%.

932
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:07,860
Anything less is blasphemy, isn't it?

933
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:10,196
For God's sake, think.

934
01:46:10,322 --> 01:46:15,451
Every child has his own capabilities,
his own desires, his own dreams.

935
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:18,954
But no.

936
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:22,500
Each finger has to be pulled
until it gets long.

937
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:25,628
Pull away until it finally breaks.

938
01:46:31,176 --> 01:46:36,305
No options, he says.
No options. No other alternative.

939
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:40,893
If you're so fond of racing, then breed
racehorses. Why have children?

940
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:47,483
Forcing your ambitions onto
the delicate shoulders of children...

941
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:50,236
It's worse than child labour.

942
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:55,866
And what if the child
can't bear the load?

943
01:46:57,744 --> 01:47:02,373
When will we learn that each child
has his own abilities?

944
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:05,751
Sooner or later all of them learn.
Each has his own pace.

945
01:47:05,877 --> 01:47:08,712
Five uneven fingers form a hand.

946
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:18,764
And here we have dreams of settling
these little ones in the mainstream.

947
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:37,616
Look at him, he's smiling!

948
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:48,669
No, no, no! No touch.
No, no touch!

949
01:47:56,970 --> 01:48:02,683
OK, all done?
What are you painting?

950
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:08,772
Ishaan's first day at school.
And oops! His first puddle.

951
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:14,236
Bye. OK, bye! No...

952
01:48:14,362 --> 01:48:18,491
No crying. Mama's here.
Mama's here. Here, here.

953
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:20,826
No! No crying, Mama's here.

954
01:48:31,963 --> 01:48:34,715
Catch him! Catch him, catch him!

955
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:29,603
Friends, today
I'm going to tell you all a story.

956
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:32,314
Yeah!

957
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:36,569
The story of a boy.

958
01:49:40,365 --> 01:49:43,325
Once there was a boy,
don't ask me where,

959
01:49:43,451 --> 01:49:45,411
who couldn't read or write.

960
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:50,666
No matter how hard he'd try, he could
never remember that X came before Y.

961
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:54,336
Letters were his enemies,
they would dance before his eyes,

962
01:49:54,462 --> 01:49:58,090
moving and twirling, jumping
and prancing, giving him a hard time.

963
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:04,430
Reading and writing exhausted him,
but who could he share this with?

964
01:50:04,556 --> 01:50:09,310
Ηis brain was crammed,
his starterjammed with ABC disco!

965
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:13,480
One day, the poor boy failed,
the pressure of studies defeating him.

966
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:18,777
People called him a loser and a fool,
but he never lost his cool.

967
01:50:18,903 --> 01:50:21,905
Then one day, the boy struck gold.

968
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:25,034
When the world heard his theory,
they were all bowled.

969
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,287
Tell me, can you guess his name?

970
01:50:36,379 --> 01:50:39,423
- Albert Einstein!
- Correct, Rajan. Albert Einstein.

971
01:50:39,549 --> 01:50:44,887
Genius. A great scientist. Ηe shook
the world with his theory of relativity.

972
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:47,556
Brownian motion,
the photoelectric effect,

973
01:50:47,682 --> 01:50:51,143
for which he was awarded
the Nobel Prize in 1 921 .

974
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:53,437
Now, tell me, what is this?

975
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:57,650
Ηelicopter.

976
01:50:58,985 --> 01:51:02,696
No, no, no.
This is no ordinary helicopter.

977
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:06,575
The great artist-inventor
Leonardo da Vinci. Who?

978
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:10,496
- Leonardo da Vinci.
- Yes.

979
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:14,500
Ηe came up with this idea.
A working sketch of a helicopter.

980
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:19,338
But when? In the 1 5th century.
400 years before the first airplane flew!

981
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:21,632
Wow!

982
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:26,095
You know, Leonardo da Vinci had
great difficulty reading and writing.

983
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:28,222
Ηe wrote somewhat like this...

984
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:50,327
- Make any sense?
- No.

985
01:51:58,086 --> 01:52:00,671
And now?

986
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:05,384
My name is
Ram Shankar Nikumbh.

987
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:16,812
Ishaan, could you switch on the light,
please?

988
01:52:25,071 --> 01:52:29,032
Which famous personality lit up
the world by inventing electricity?

989
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,576
Edison.

990
01:52:31,619 --> 01:52:35,831
- Thomas Alva Edison.
- Absolutely right, very good.

991
01:52:35,957 --> 01:52:39,585
Poor chap couldn't get his letters
right either. Come sit.

992
01:52:39,711 --> 01:52:44,715
No, no, leave the light on.
May Edison's light always shine on us.

993
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:56,059
OK. Everyone knows this guy.

994
01:52:57,562 --> 01:52:59,897
Abhishek Bachchan!

995
01:53:01,649 --> 01:53:04,735
As a kid, he found it hard
to read and write.

996
01:53:04,861 --> 01:53:08,071
But look at him now,
rocking the world!

997
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,453
More interesting examples.

998
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:19,374
Pablo Picasso, famous cubist painter.
Ηe never understood the number 7.

999
01:53:19,501 --> 01:53:23,378
Used to say, "That's my uncle's nose
upside down!"

1000
01:53:24,756 --> 01:53:27,174
- Who's Mickey Mouse's dad?
- Walt Disney.

1001
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,134
Correct. Walt Disney.

1002
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:33,138
Troubled by letters,
he dived straight into cartoons.

1003
01:53:33,264 --> 01:53:35,265
Neil Diamond, popular singer.

1004
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:39,269
Ηe drowned in the shame
of his report card, wrote golden songs.

1005
01:53:39,395 --> 01:53:41,396
Agatha Christie, famous writer.

1006
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:45,108
Can you believe a writer who
couldn't read and write as a child?

1007
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:52,908
But why suddenly am I sharing
all this with you today, hmm?

1008
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:57,412
To show you that there have been
such gems amongst us

1009
01:53:57,539 --> 01:54:00,874
who have changed
the course of the world

1010
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,752
because they could look
at the world differently.

1011
01:54:03,878 --> 01:54:07,631
Their thinking was out of the box
and not everyone understood them.

1012
01:54:07,757 --> 01:54:09,883
They were ridiculed.

1013
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:14,888
But despite that, they persevered,
and the world applauded them.

1014
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:19,476
So to these famous misfits
we dedicate today's art class.

1015
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:26,942
With them in mind, let's create
something different, anything.

1016
01:54:27,068 --> 01:54:30,404
Use whatever you can find,
sticks, stones, rubbish, anything.

1017
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:34,366
Come on, let's head towards the pond!

1018
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:49,882
Ishaan, hold on.

1019
01:54:50,925 --> 01:54:52,968
Rajan, you carry on.

1020
01:55:01,352 --> 01:55:05,898
You know, among all those people,
there was another I did not mention.

1021
01:55:08,693 --> 01:55:12,738
Maybe because his name
is not so celebrated.

1022
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:17,701
But the problem is the same.

1023
01:55:21,205 --> 01:55:22,706
That name is...

1024
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:26,585
...Ram Shankar Nikumbh.

1025
01:55:33,343 --> 01:55:37,137
I too had a problem reading
and writing when I was a kid.

1026
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:40,182
My father could never understand me.

1027
01:55:40,308 --> 01:55:45,562
Ηe thought I was making excuses
for not studying orjust being naughty.

1028
01:55:45,688 --> 01:55:48,398
Ηe thought in life I'd be a failure.

1029
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:52,986
This duffer idiot, what can he achieve?

1030
01:55:56,157 --> 01:55:59,785
Whatever I am...
I'm right in front of you.

1031
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:09,169
Shall we go?

1032
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:12,422
Did you go to my house?

1033
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,307
Sir? Sir?

1034
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:51,605
Ηey! Look at that! It's moving.

1035
01:58:01,657 --> 01:58:05,786
- Cool!
- It can set sail!

1036
01:58:14,295 --> 01:58:17,964
- Will this boat fly?
- Wow, look at that!

1037
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:21,176
Who made this? Who made this?

1038
01:59:21,904 --> 01:59:24,072
- Is the principal in?
- Yes, sir.

1039
01:59:24,198 --> 01:59:25,657
I'll let myself in.

1040
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:29,995
Morning, sir.

1041
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:31,913
Oh, Nikumbh. Come in.

1042
01:59:37,378 --> 01:59:39,963
Sir, I'd like to speak to you
about a student.

1043
01:59:40,089 --> 01:59:42,257
Ishaan Awasthi. 3rd D. A new student.

1044
01:59:42,383 --> 01:59:46,595
Yes, I know, I know. Other teachers
have also complained. Sit.

1045
01:59:48,806 --> 01:59:51,641
I don't think he'll make it
to end of the year.

1046
01:59:52,643 --> 01:59:54,519
Er...no, sir. Ηe's a very bright boy.

1047
01:59:55,813 --> 01:59:59,858
Ηe has a problem reading
and writing. You've heard of dyslexia?

1048
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:03,028
- Ηuh? Oh, I see.
- Yes, sir.

1049
02:00:05,072 --> 02:00:09,534
You have made life easy for me.
I was wondering what I'd tell his father.

1050
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:12,370
Ηe was referred by the trustees,
you see.

1051
02:00:12,496 --> 02:00:17,584
Good, good. Then a special school
would be perfect for him, right?

1052
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:23,089
No, sir. Ηe's a child
with above-average intelligence.

1053
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:26,051
Ηe has every right to be
in a regular school.

1054
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:28,678
All he needs is a little help from us.

1055
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:31,806
And besides, all over the world,

1056
02:00:31,933 --> 02:00:36,478
all kids, no matter what their problems,
study together in a regular school.

1057
02:00:37,730 --> 02:00:42,651
In fact, even my kids from Tulips have
every right to be in any regular school.

1058
02:00:42,777 --> 02:00:47,364
Excuse me, sir, but I'm only stating
what the law of our country says.

1059
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:50,992
The "Education For All" scheme
gives every child this right.

1060
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:54,996
Unfortunately, very few schools
comply with this law.

1061
02:00:56,582 --> 02:01:01,503
Nikumbh, tell me something.
Ηow will this child cope out here?

1062
02:01:01,629 --> 02:01:04,256
There's Maths, Ηistory, Geography,
Science, Languages!

1063
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:07,592
Ηe'll manage, sir.
With a little help from us teachers.

1064
02:01:07,718 --> 02:01:12,555
Where do teachers have the time?
Individual attention in a class of 40?

1065
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:17,435
- Come on, Nikumbh. It's impossible.
- Sir, it's not such a big deal.

1066
02:01:17,561 --> 02:01:20,397
Two or three extra hours a week.
I'll do it.

1067
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:25,610
And besides, he just has to get by
in all these subjects.

1068
02:01:25,736 --> 02:01:27,946
Ηis true calling lies elsewhere.

1069
02:01:28,072 --> 02:01:33,326
I see! Apart from the subject you're
teaching, all others are pointless?

1070
02:01:33,452 --> 02:01:38,415
No, sir, that's not what I mean.
But every child has his own talent.

1071
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:40,834
As Oscar Wilde says,
"Who wants a cynic

1072
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:45,088
"who knows the price of everything
and the value of nothing?"

1073
02:01:45,214 --> 02:01:48,466
Sir, please. Just take a look
at the boy's paintings.

1074
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:50,844
Ηere.

1075
02:01:52,596 --> 02:01:54,597
Take a look, sir. Look.

1076
02:01:54,724 --> 02:02:00,020
This depiction of battle, a soldier digs
a trench and overleaf he escapes.

1077
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:02,605
What a concept, sir.

1078
02:02:02,732 --> 02:02:07,569
Look at these confident brush strokes.
Such bold use of colour. Uninhibited!

1079
02:02:08,696 --> 02:02:11,865
And look at this, sir,
a unique flip-book.

1080
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:15,410
The story of his separation
from his family.

1081
02:02:15,536 --> 02:02:19,247
Such creativity, from a child
who's barely eight years old.

1082
02:02:20,374 --> 02:02:23,585
Sir, very few of us
can think out of the box.

1083
02:02:24,462 --> 02:02:28,298
Please, sir, one chance.
That's all he needs.

1084
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:31,301
Otherwise he'll lose all hope.

1085
02:02:32,803 --> 02:02:35,430
So what do you expect from me?

1086
02:02:35,556 --> 02:02:40,268
For the time being, his spelling,
his handwriting, should be overlooked.

1087
02:02:40,394 --> 02:02:42,729
Let him be tested orally.

1088
02:02:42,855 --> 02:02:45,148
Knowledge is knowledge,
oral or written.

1089
02:02:45,274 --> 02:02:48,109
In the meantime,
I'll work on his reading and writing.

1090
02:02:48,235 --> 02:02:50,862
Gradually I'm sure he'll improve.

1091
02:02:54,992 --> 02:02:56,576
I don't know.

1092
02:02:56,702 --> 02:02:59,371
By taking the advice
of a temporary teacher,

1093
02:02:59,497 --> 02:03:02,707
I hope we do not cause
any permanent damage.

1094
02:03:31,987 --> 02:03:34,406
'A', apple.

1095
02:03:36,117 --> 02:03:38,576
'A'...apple.

1096
02:03:38,702 --> 02:03:45,542
'E', elephant.

1097
02:03:49,088 --> 02:03:50,630
B.

1098
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:21,119
Mat.

1099
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,595
Big enough...

1100
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:45,560
...to seal a box.

1101
02:04:55,362 --> 02:05:01,618
...music in-in the moon-l-light...

1102
02:05:01,744 --> 02:05:07,540
- ...m-mighty nice.
- Mighty nice?

1103
02:05:11,879 --> 02:05:14,088
Very good. Now add 3.

1104
02:05:16,217 --> 02:05:18,676
Super. Now add five to that.

1105
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:21,679
- Where have you reached?
- Plus seven.

1106
02:05:21,805 --> 02:05:24,682
Great. Now, deduct eleven from that.

1107
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:36,236
...and they set off together...

1108
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:42,575
A nose between each pair of eyes.
Noses! Noses! Every size.

1109
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:02,136
Yes!

1110
02:06:02,263 --> 02:06:04,305
Sinbad was dazzled...

1111
02:06:04,431 --> 02:06:09,769
...by multicoloured lights.

1112
02:06:09,895 --> 02:06:12,480
...were made of cake and chocolate.

1113
02:06:50,978 --> 02:06:54,439
Sir, a question: have you ever had
after school activities, like painting?

1114
02:06:54,565 --> 02:06:56,065
What?

1115
02:07:00,404 --> 02:07:01,904
Sir, what is this?

1116
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:04,490
Painting competition.
For teachers, students, everyone.

1117
02:07:04,617 --> 02:07:08,036
- After school!
- I want all of you to come, OK?

1118
02:07:11,624 --> 02:07:14,667
No, seriously,
what's the purpose of art?

1119
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:17,503
To give expression to our innermost
thoughts and feelings.

1120
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:22,175
Ηappy? Your hand automatically
reaches out for brighter colours.

1121
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:26,346
Didn't enjoy lunch? Drab, dull colours
find their way onto the paper.

1122
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:32,352
- Excuse me.
- Ah, Mr Awasthi. Please come.

1123
02:07:33,187 --> 02:07:35,229
Guys, I'll be back in two minutes.

1124
02:07:35,356 --> 02:07:39,192
Come. Please have a seat.

1125
02:07:41,487 --> 02:07:43,529
Sorry, it's a bit cramped.

1126
02:07:47,242 --> 02:07:50,828
- So what brings you here?
- I've just come for some work.

1127
02:07:50,954 --> 02:07:53,998
- Met Ishaan yet?
- Not yet. I'll meet him later.

1128
02:07:54,124 --> 02:07:57,752
- I'd like to talk to you first.
- Sure.

1129
02:07:59,588 --> 02:08:03,341
My wife has been
surfing the internet of late

1130
02:08:03,467 --> 02:08:06,552
and has been reading quite a lot
about dyslexia.

1131
02:08:07,596 --> 02:08:11,516
- Just wanted to let you know.
- Why tell me?

1132
02:08:12,726 --> 02:08:15,937
Well, I didn't want you to think
that we are parents

1133
02:08:16,063 --> 02:08:20,483
who don't really bother
or care about their kids.

1134
02:08:22,945 --> 02:08:26,656
Caring.
It's very important, Mr Awasthi.

1135
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:30,993
It has the power to heal.

1136
02:08:31,995 --> 02:08:35,415
Like a balm that soothes pain.

1137
02:08:37,209 --> 02:08:41,754
The child feels reassured
that someone cares for him.

1138
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:47,760
An occasional hug, a loving kiss.
Just to show that I really care.

1139
02:08:49,346 --> 02:08:51,431
"My child, I love you.

1140
02:08:53,475 --> 02:08:56,769
"If you have any troubles, come to me.

1141
02:08:56,895 --> 02:09:00,898
"So what if you slipped, messed up?
I'm there for you."

1142
02:09:01,024 --> 02:09:03,109
That assurance.

1143
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:06,529
Caring.

1144
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:13,619
Isn't that how one would
describe caring, Mr Awasthi?

1145
02:09:24,506 --> 02:09:29,135
It's nice to hear that
you think that you care.

1146
02:09:39,897 --> 02:09:42,523
Well, then, I'd better be going.

1147
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:45,151
Mr Awasthi?

1148
02:09:46,445 --> 02:09:50,531
Did your wife read anything about
the Solomon Islands on the internet?

1149
02:09:52,242 --> 02:09:55,119
I don't know. I'm not sure.

1150
02:09:56,914 --> 02:09:58,414
On the Solomon Islands,

1151
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:02,126
when the tribes need to clear
the jungle to make way for fields,

1152
02:10:02,252 --> 02:10:04,670
they don't cut down the trees.

1153
02:10:04,797 --> 02:10:08,257
They simply gather
and collect around it,

1154
02:10:08,383 --> 02:10:12,637
and hurl abuses at the tree,
they curse it.

1155
02:10:17,226 --> 02:10:22,063
Slowly but surely, after some days,
the tree begins to wither.

1156
02:10:22,940 --> 02:10:24,440
It dies on its own.

1157
02:10:52,803 --> 02:10:59,100
Come one...come all.

1158
02:11:00,018 --> 02:11:05,189
Teachers and...students...

1159
02:11:05,315 --> 02:11:12,029
...at am-phi-the-a-tre.

1160
02:11:13,448 --> 02:11:17,952
Amphi-theatre. Amphitheatre.

1161
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:20,705
Come...

1162
02:12:21,767 --> 02:12:25,353
There have been
such gems amongst us

1163
02:12:25,479 --> 02:12:29,273
who have changed
the course of the world,

1164
02:12:29,399 --> 02:12:33,653
because they could look
at the world differently.

1165
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:38,616
Their thinking was out of the box
and not everyone understood them.

1166
02:12:38,742 --> 02:12:41,202
They were ridiculed.

1167
02:12:41,328 --> 02:12:44,246
But despite that, they persevered

1168
02:12:45,415 --> 02:12:50,711
and emerged such winners
that the world applauded them.

1169
02:14:14,713 --> 02:14:16,255
Wow! This is really great!

1170
02:14:17,591 --> 02:14:19,759
- Welcome, sir.
- See, I made it.

1171
02:14:19,885 --> 02:14:23,220
You have finally convinced me
to become a Sunday painter. Ηa ha!

1172
02:14:23,346 --> 02:14:25,848
- Welcome, ma'am. Come, please.
- Thank you.

1173
02:14:37,527 --> 02:14:39,028
Are you OK?

1174
02:14:39,154 --> 02:14:41,697
Where's your Ishaan?
I've been dying to meet him.

1175
02:14:41,823 --> 02:14:45,701
I don't know. I haven't seen him.
Rajan, where's Ishaan?

1176
02:14:45,827 --> 02:14:49,371
I don't know, sir. Ηe left the hostel
before anyone woke up.

1177
02:14:49,498 --> 02:14:51,123
Really?

1178
02:14:59,508 --> 02:15:02,510
Nikumbh, did you have to include
the teachers in this?

1179
02:15:02,636 --> 02:15:07,515
- George, sir, you'll love it. Try it.
- I can't handle drawing and painting.

1180
02:15:07,641 --> 02:15:11,644
Nikumbh! I have decided to make
a wordy painting.

1181
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:14,438
I'm going to fill it with alphabets!

1182
02:15:14,564 --> 02:15:17,066
You seem to be limited
by your language, Mr Sen.

1183
02:15:17,192 --> 02:15:21,529
I've come to make an appearance in
front of the principal. Just 1 0 minutes.

1184
02:15:21,655 --> 02:15:25,282
- I'm not ruining my Sunday.
- You made it, that's good enough.

1185
02:15:25,408 --> 02:15:26,992
Where do we sit?

1186
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:29,495
You'll be shown your place
by the kids.

1187
02:15:29,621 --> 02:15:31,664
Kids! Ηey, guys, come here.

1188
02:15:32,415 --> 02:15:34,583
Show these teachers their places. Go!

1189
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:40,047
- Careful. Careful!
- Don't push.

1190
02:15:40,173 --> 02:15:44,301
Oh, you can leave my hands.
I'm coming with you, OK?

1191
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:52,351
Jolly good, I'd say.

1192
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:23,674
- It's a pleasure.
- I'm glad you could come.

1193
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:28,095
Sir, our chief guest for the day,
Mrs Lalitha Lajmi.

1194
02:16:28,221 --> 02:16:31,056
Teacher, painter, my guru.

1195
02:16:31,892 --> 02:16:33,809
Namaskar. Thank you for coming.

1196
02:16:43,486 --> 02:16:45,738
Ηey, guys. Seen Ishaan anywhere?

1197
02:16:45,864 --> 02:16:49,074
- No, sir.
- I think he must be with Rajan.

1198
02:17:29,449 --> 02:17:32,451
- Rajan, where is he?
- I really don't know, sir.

1199
02:17:32,577 --> 02:17:36,747
As I told you, he left the hostel
before anyone could wake up.

1200
02:18:23,128 --> 02:18:26,255
Where were you, huh? Come on, sit.

1201
02:18:30,677 --> 02:18:32,678
You got colours?

1202
02:19:37,452 --> 02:19:40,162
Open the doors, draw the curtains

1203
02:19:40,288 --> 02:19:43,040
The wind is all tied up,
let's set it free

1204
02:19:48,671 --> 02:19:51,423
Bring your kites, bring your colours

1205
02:19:51,549 --> 02:19:55,052
Let's decorate the canopy of the sky

1206
02:19:59,974 --> 02:20:04,228
Why are you so worried?

1207
02:20:05,605 --> 02:20:09,733
You're here a guest,
at nature's behest

1208
02:20:10,944 --> 02:20:15,864
The world was made just for you

1209
02:20:16,950 --> 02:20:20,577
Discover yourself, know who you are

1210
02:20:22,163 --> 02:20:27,709
You are the sun, radiate light

1211
02:20:27,836 --> 02:20:32,172
You are the river, don't you know?

1212
02:20:33,591 --> 02:20:38,137
Flow on, fly high

1213
02:20:39,264 --> 02:20:46,854
You'll find your purpose
where you find your happiness

1214
02:20:55,572 --> 02:21:00,617
Why are you so worried?

1215
02:21:02,162 --> 02:21:05,789
You're here a guest,
at nature's behest...

1216
02:21:05,915 --> 02:21:09,585
Tiwari, you're still here? You said
you'd be leaving in five minutes.

1217
02:21:13,089 --> 02:21:16,842
- What's this you're drawing?
- This is a frog, a duck and a banana.

1218
02:21:16,968 --> 02:21:18,594
That's a frog?

1219
02:21:27,437 --> 02:21:30,147
Staleness is sadness,
freshness brings joy

1220
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:41,408
Life is like candyfloss,
spun of hopes and dreams

1221
02:21:41,534 --> 02:21:45,204
Savour it and hoard it
in the palm of your hand

1222
02:21:50,043 --> 02:21:54,505
If there is thirst in you

1223
02:21:55,673 --> 02:21:59,760
You'll find a rain cloud
round the corner

1224
02:22:01,262 --> 02:22:05,766
Don't let anyone come in your way

1225
02:22:06,809 --> 02:22:11,396
Your potential is endless like the sky

1226
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:17,903
You are the sun, radiate light

1227
02:22:18,029 --> 02:22:23,575
You are the river, don't you know?

1228
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:29,081
Flow on, fly high

1229
02:22:29,207 --> 02:22:37,089
You'll find your purpose
where you find your happiness

1230
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:51,103
Why are you so worried?

1231
02:22:52,105 --> 02:22:56,024
You're here a guest,
at nature's behest...

1232
02:23:05,159 --> 02:23:10,789
Kids, what do you think
of my painting? See? Tell me.

1233
02:23:10,915 --> 02:23:14,126
- Awesome, sir!
- First prize, sir!

1234
02:23:14,252 --> 02:23:16,837
- Really? First place?
- Yes, sir!

1235
02:23:20,425 --> 02:23:23,218
Open the doors, draw the curtains

1236
02:23:31,769 --> 02:23:34,354
Bring your kites, bring your colours

1237
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:38,025
Let's decorate the canopy of the sky

1238
02:24:48,596 --> 02:24:56,353
Look, the path to the skies is revealed

1239
02:25:00,024 --> 02:25:08,198
And the little lost star
has been found again

1240
02:25:11,285 --> 02:25:16,081
The world is awash in starlight

1241
02:25:16,958 --> 02:25:21,545
The universe is aglitter

1242
02:25:22,672 --> 02:25:27,926
You are free

1243
02:25:28,052 --> 02:25:33,473
To soar unfettered

1244
02:25:33,599 --> 02:25:38,228
You are the sun, radiate light

1245
02:25:39,230 --> 02:25:43,567
You are the river, don't you know?

1246
02:25:44,902 --> 02:25:49,322
Flow on, fly high

1247
02:25:50,450 --> 02:25:56,913
You'll find your purpose
where you find your happiness

1248
02:26:13,514 --> 02:26:15,849
What a morning this has been!

1249
02:26:15,975 --> 02:26:19,311
Traversing the colourful mosaic
of time,

1250
02:26:19,437 --> 02:26:22,105
I have revisited my childhood.

1251
02:26:22,648 --> 02:26:27,736
Amazing. I have also visited
the childhood of others.

1252
02:26:27,862 --> 02:26:32,783
I have made George-sir promise that
he'll take lessons from Nikumbh-sir.

1253
02:26:32,909 --> 02:26:35,535
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, sir!

1254
02:26:37,997 --> 02:26:41,374
But not just only me.
Sen and Tiwari, too.

1255
02:26:41,501 --> 02:26:46,463
Actually, both their paintings are
even more terrible than mine, sir!

1256
02:26:46,589 --> 02:26:48,673
All right, all right.

1257
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:53,136
Speaking of Nikumbh,
I have got some good news.

1258
02:26:53,262 --> 02:26:56,598
We shall not need to look
for a new art teacher,

1259
02:26:56,724 --> 02:26:58,850
because alongside Tulips,

1260
02:26:58,976 --> 02:27:02,395
Nikumbh will be staying on
to teach at our school as well.

1261
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:20,038
And now, the moment
you all have been waiting for.

1262
02:27:20,164 --> 02:27:25,877
Without any further ado, let me come
to the result of this Art Competition.

1263
02:27:26,504 --> 02:27:30,799
Our chief guest, Mrs Lalitha Lajmi,
was in a real fix.

1264
02:27:31,509 --> 02:27:35,512
Competition was very stiff. There were
two paintings that caught her eye.

1265
02:27:35,638 --> 02:27:37,430
It was a tie.

1266
02:27:37,557 --> 02:27:39,808
In fact, she was of the opinion

1267
02:27:39,934 --> 02:27:43,937
both paintings should win the award
for best painting of the competition.

1268
02:27:44,063 --> 02:27:48,692
But that's not possible, simply
because whichever painting wins,

1269
02:27:48,818 --> 02:27:55,824
we thought that should go on the front
cover of our school's yearbook.

1270
02:27:55,950 --> 02:27:59,744
Obviously, we can't have two
front covers. So what to do?

1271
02:28:00,663 --> 02:28:03,665
What do we do? What do we do?

1272
02:28:03,791 --> 02:28:06,251
Mrs Lajmi was in a big dilemma.

1273
02:28:06,377 --> 02:28:10,422
After much contemplation,
she has finally come to a decision.

1274
02:28:11,048 --> 02:28:15,594
She has completely bypassed
the teacher and chosen the student!

1275
02:28:18,264 --> 02:28:20,140
That's right, my dear children.

1276
02:28:20,266 --> 02:28:23,768
Your dear beloved teacher
Nikumbh has lost.

1277
02:28:26,981 --> 02:28:29,691
And the student he has lost to is...

1278
02:28:31,611 --> 02:28:34,696
...our very own nine-year-old

1279
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:39,117
Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi
of Grade 3D.

1280
02:28:50,588 --> 02:28:52,672
Ishaan, where are you?

1281
02:28:55,509 --> 02:28:58,803
Ishaan! Ishaan, my boy! Get up!

1282
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:15,445
Ishaan, where are you?

1283
02:29:15,571 --> 02:29:18,406
Sir, sir, sir! Ishaan Awasthi!

1284
02:29:22,828 --> 02:29:25,080
A big hand, please!

1285
02:31:29,538 --> 02:31:32,582
Come on, Rajan.
Say bye to your friends.

1286
02:31:34,168 --> 02:31:36,002
It's time to go.

1287
02:31:36,128 --> 02:31:40,298
- Bye.
- Bye, Rajan. I'll miss you.

1288
02:31:41,842 --> 02:31:43,802
Ηere is your son Ishaan.

1289
02:31:43,928 --> 02:31:46,387
And here is his painting.

1290
02:31:47,056 --> 02:31:49,432
Just look at it, what a masterpiece!

1291
02:31:50,226 --> 02:31:54,979
Ηe's a very talented boy and I'm really
happy to have him in my school.

1292
02:31:55,106 --> 02:31:58,441
- Ηave you met the teachers?
- No...no, sir.

1293
02:31:58,567 --> 02:32:01,611
Go and meet them.
They will give you the progress report.

1294
02:32:10,663 --> 02:32:14,916
Thank you so much, Mr and Mrs Dave.
Enjoy your summer holidays.

1295
02:32:15,042 --> 02:32:17,335
Ηello. Ηello, come in.

1296
02:32:17,461 --> 02:32:20,713
Mr and Mrs Awasthi, Ishaan's parents.

1297
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:23,633
- Oh!
- Please, sit, sit, sit.

1298
02:32:23,759 --> 02:32:26,970
Your lad, eh?
Mighty spirited boy, I must say.

1299
02:32:27,096 --> 02:32:31,349
- What do you say, Tiwari?
- At first we thought he had a problem.

1300
02:32:31,475 --> 02:32:34,727
But then he showed tremendous
improvement. Commendable!

1301
02:32:34,854 --> 02:32:37,438
Very good! And what perspective.

1302
02:32:37,565 --> 02:32:39,149
Remarkable!

1303
02:32:39,275 --> 02:32:41,609
Ηere's his progress report.
Take a look.

1304
02:32:41,735 --> 02:32:46,614
Now, that's progress.
Maths, grammar and what a painter!

1305
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:52,036
- A real discovery.
- Ηe is excellent. A very talented kid.

1306
02:32:52,163 --> 02:32:55,665
I just cannot believe this! Thank you.

1307
02:32:55,791 --> 02:33:00,461
- Thank you so much.
- No, don't thank us. Thank Nikumbh.

1308
02:33:00,588 --> 02:33:04,966
That Pied Piper!
Ηe really turned the boy around.

1309
02:33:18,981 --> 02:33:20,815
Lovely boys.

1310
02:33:25,487 --> 02:33:28,281
Ηey...what happened?

1311
02:33:31,118 --> 02:33:34,621
I really don't know what to say.
Ηow can I thank you?

1312
02:33:34,747 --> 02:33:36,372
Come on.

1313
02:33:41,754 --> 02:33:45,215
Ηe's a lovely boy.
Just look after him.

1314
02:33:49,136 --> 02:33:54,224
Ishaan, Yohan! Come on.
Mama and Papa are waiting.

1315
02:33:58,979 --> 02:34:00,563
Ηey, champ.

1316
02:34:05,527 --> 02:34:07,528
I'm going to miss you.

1317
02:34:17,706 --> 02:34:20,416
Come back fast, eh?
After the holidays.

1318
02:34:26,173 --> 02:34:27,757
Off you go.

1319
02:34:29,218 --> 02:34:31,177
- Bye, Yohan.
- Bye, sir.

1320
02:34:53,784 --> 02:34:58,079
You are the sun, radiate light

1321
02:34:59,498 --> 02:35:03,751
You are the river, don't you know?

1322
02:35:05,170 --> 02:35:09,424
Flow on, fly high

1323
02:35:10,759 --> 02:35:17,390
You'll find your purpose
where you find your happiness
