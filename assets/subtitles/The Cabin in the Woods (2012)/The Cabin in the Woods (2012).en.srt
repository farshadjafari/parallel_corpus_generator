1
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:31,512
It's hormonal.

2
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:36,844
I mean, I don't usually fall
back on.. It's women's issues.

3
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:40,305
But child-proofed how?
Gates and stuff?

4
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,698
Dude, she did the drawers.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,014
We don't even know if this
whole fertility thing's gonna work..

6
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:46,878
she's screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,774
At all?

8
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:50,904
No. They open an inch,
then you gotta dig your finger in.

9
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:53,228
- It's a nightmare.
-I guess sooner or later..

10
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,706
Yeah, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

11
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:59,686
Kid will be 30 before he can
reach them, assuming we have a kid.

12
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,884
It is natural for
her to feel protective.

13
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:06,299
Don't even.. You have women's issues.

14
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,177
Please. You of all people.

15
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,775
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

16
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:14,140
It guarantees that
we won't get pregnant.

17
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,176
And it takes me about 20
minutes to get a fucking beer.

18
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,531
Guys. Guys!

19
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,793
Stockholm went south.

20
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:22,909
Seriously?
I thought they were looking good.

21
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:24,010
What cracked?

22
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:27,123
I haven't seen the footage.
Word's just going around

23
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,228
Well, that's never
been a stable scenario.

24
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:31,310
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

25
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,043
That means there's just Japan.
Japan and us.

26
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,807
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

27
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,649
Japan has a perfect record.

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,134
We're number two. We try harder.

29
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:40,713
If we fail, then..

30
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:42,466
Please. We haven't
had a glitch since '98.

31
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,900
We know what we're doing, Lin.

32
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,388
Or we have it written down..
somewhere.

33
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,185
You guys better not
be messing around in there.

34
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:51,484
Does this mean you're not in
the betting pool this year? Big money.

35
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:54,585
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

36
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,164
No, I hear what you're saying.

37
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:59,373
In '98, it was the chem
department's fault, right?

38
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,787
Where do you work, again?
Wait. It's coming back to me, now.

39
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:07,368
It's gonna be a long weekend
if everyone's that puckered up.

40
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,199
You wanna come over Monday night?

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,907
I'm gonna pick up some power drills.
Liberate my cabinets.

42
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:16,735
Are you even listening to me?

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,236
Professor fuckwad.

44
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:07,139
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

45
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,213
It's not that simple
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:12,877
Your hair. It's blonde.
- Very fabulous, no?

47
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:15,709
I can't believe you did it.
-But very fabulous, right?

48
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,463
Hurry up with the "very fabulous."
I'm getting insecure about it now.

49
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,204
No, it looks awesome.
Curt's gonna lose it.

50
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,161
Curt's gonna thank me.
And so will you..

51
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,120
while we're burning this picture.

52
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:28,304
Not ready.

53
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:31,122
Seriously, this isn't his fault.

54
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:33,468
What's not his fault?

55
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,900
Fucking his student or
breaking up with her by email?

56
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,864
I knew what I was getting into.

57
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:39,574
Oh, please.

58
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:41,387
You know what you're
getting into this weekend?

59
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,567
This.

60
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,340
And if Holden's as
cute as Curt says he is..

61
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:49,026
possibly getting out of it.

62
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:51,242
That is the last thing that I want.

63
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,877
If you treat this like a setup,
I'm gonna have no fun at all.

64
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:55,022
I'm not pushing..

65
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:57,360
but we're packing this!

66
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:01,350
Which means we definitely
won't have room for..

67
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:02,961
What if I get bored?

68
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:04,344
These will help?

69
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:08,703
Soviet Economic Structures?
Aftermath of the..

70
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:12,778
No! We have a lake and a keg.

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,556
No more learning!
-Think fast.

72
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:16,170
Faster than that.

73
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,492
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

74
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:23,302
Nice!
-Is that Holden?

75
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:26,105
We'll be right down.
He just transferred from State.

76
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:28,807
Best hands on the team.
He's a sweet guy.

77
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,317
And he's good with his hands.

78
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,860
I'm kinda seeing this girl..

79
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,279
but you're way blonder than she is.

80
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:39,086
But I was thinking, you know, maybe..
What is this?

81
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,363
What.. this?
What are you doing with these?

82
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,810
Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books.

83
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:45,066
No, who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

84
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,935
I learned it from you, okay?

85
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,259
I learned it from watching you!

86
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:54,649
Seriously, Professor Bennett, he
covers this whole book in his lectures.

87
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:58,707
You should read this.

88
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,206
Gurovsky. Now this is way
more interesting.

89
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,930
Also, Bennett doesn't
know it by heart..

90
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,598
so he'll think you're insightful.

91
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:07,512
And you have no pants.

92
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,754
Oh, shit!

93
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:16,728
- That pretty much it?
-Fucking better be.

94
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:19,588
You know, Jules,
it's a weekend, not an evacuation.

95
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:22,848
Trust me when I say there
is nothing in those cases..

96
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,189
you won't be glad I brought.

97
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm shutting' right up.

98
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:31,910
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:36,858
Marty!

100
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:41,449
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

101
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:49,103
People in this town drive
in a very counterintuitive manner.

102
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,891
That's what I have to say.

103
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,290
Do you wanna spend
the weekend in jail?

104
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,632
We'd all like to check
out my cousin's country home.

105
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:58,255
Honey, that's not okay.

106
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,858
Statistical fact..

107
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:03,973
Cops will never pull over
a man with a huge bong in his car.

108
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:04,584
Why?

109
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:08,543
They fear this man.
They know he sees further than they..

110
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:13,189
and he will bind them
with ancient logics.

111
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,362
Have you gone gray?

112
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:18,709
You're not bringing
that thing in the Rambler.

113
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,011
What?

114
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,036
A giant bong in your father's van?

115
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,153
What are you, stoned?

116
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:29,016
Hey, man.

117
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:34,043
Dana, you fetching minx!

118
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,670
You have any food?

119
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,814
Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

120
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:42,082
Yeah?
- Okay, I'm ready!

121
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,475
Let's get this show on the road!

122
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,141
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

123
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,812
I hope this is the right road.

124
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:12,242
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

125
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,276
It is unworthy of global positioning.

126
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:18,180
That's the whole point.
Get off the grid, right?

127
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:20,521
No cell phone reception..

128
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,807
no traffic cameras.

129
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,103
Go someplace for one goddamn
weekend where they can't..

130
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,696
globally position my ass, man.

131
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,178
This is the whole issue.

132
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,935
Is society crumbling, Marty?

133
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:35,596
No. Society is binding. Right?

134
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:38,882
It's filling in the
cracks with concrete.

135
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:43,475
Everything's filed or
recorded or blogged, right?

136
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:46,884
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost.

137
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:49,043
Society needs to crumble.

138
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:51,961
We're all just too
chicken-shit to let it.

139
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:53,649
I've missed your rants.

140
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,822
You will come to see things my way.

141
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,742
Identification, please.

142
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,088
Mr. Sitterson.

143
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:11,110
Mr. Hadley.
- Thank you.

144
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,285
What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

145
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,596
This isn't the military.
You can drop the "sir".

146
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,348
But Sitterson does
like to be called "ma'am."

147
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,992
Or "honey toes."
- He'll also answer to "honey toes."

148
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,261
You clear on what's
gonna be happening here?

149
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:24,752
I've been prepped. Extensively.

150
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,887
Did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared?

151
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,483
They told me.
I'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley.

152
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:31,233
Good man.

153
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,658
Okay. System's online.

154
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:38,433
Acquiring target.
Let's see what we got.

155
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,706
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

156
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,538
I don't think it knows about money.

157
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,937
I think it's barter gas.

158
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,432
Hello?

159
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,525
Hey, Holden.

160
00:09:56,836 --> 00:10:00,221
Holden!
- I don't think there's gonna be..

161
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:02,537
You come here uninvited?
- Fuck!

162
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:10,114
Sign says "closed."

163
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,820
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.

164
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,192
Does this pump work?

165
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:16,793
If you know how to work it.

166
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,212
We also wanted to get directions.

167
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:22,442
We're looking for.. What's it called?

168
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:25,014
Tillerman Road.
Do you know if it's this way?

169
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:31,490
Tillerman Road takes
you up the hill, there.

170
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:33,530
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.

171
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,561
My cousin bought a house up there.

172
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,683
You go through a mountain tunnel,
there's a lake.

173
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:39,986
- Would that be the..
- Buckner place.

174
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:43,145
Always someone looking
to sell that plot.

175
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:45,033
You knew the original owners.

176
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,519
Yeah, not the first.

177
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,846
I seen plenty come and go.
Hell, I been here since the war.

178
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:55,388
- Which war?
- You know damn well which war!

179
00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:01,086
Would that have been with
the blue and some in gray?

180
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:05,482
Brother, perhaps,
fighting against brother in that war?

181
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:06,573
You sassing me, boy?

182
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:08,198
You were rude to my friend.

183
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,888
That whore?

184
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:14,398
What'd you say?
-I think we got enough gas.

185
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,645
You got enough to get you there.

186
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:17,653
Getting back..

187
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:19,672
that's your concern.

188
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:35,563
Well, good luck with
your business, sir.

189
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,654
I know the railroad's coming
through here any day, now.

190
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:39,654
That's gonna be big.

191
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,062
Streets paved with actual street.

192
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:45,169
Fucker.

193
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,049
This must be it.

194
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,523
Oh, my God. It's.. beautiful.

195
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,793
One spider and I'm
sleeping in the Rambler.

196
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,328
I mean it.

197
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,971
Come on. Give me a hand.

198
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,530
This is awesome.

199
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,049
It is kind of cool.

200
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,338
You gonna kill us a raccoon to eat?

201
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,974
I will use its skin to make a cap.

202
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:36,769
Everybody get your suits on. In
10 minutes, we're heading to the lake.

203
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:37,751
Yeah.

204
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,789
I was not informed there
would be calisthenics.

205
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,625
Yeah, I don't think so.

206
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,490
Whoa.

207
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:17,321
No way.

208
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:37,206
Ah, shit.

209
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:43,044
This is happening.

210
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:54,081
Hold up!

211
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:59,072
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

212
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:00,668
That's just creepy.

213
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,197
It was pioneer days.

214
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:06,195
People had to make their
own interrogation rooms.

215
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:07,846
Who did your cousin
buy this place from?

216
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,553
We should check the rest of the rooms,
make sure this is the only one.

217
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,905
'Cause you know Marty wants
to watch us pounding away.

218
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,743
I didn't even like hearing that.

219
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,850
How about we switch?

220
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,047
Not that I'd..

221
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:28,278
I mean, I'd put the picture back but you
might feel better if we switched rooms?

222
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:30,725
I really would.

223
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:36,661
Thanks. For being decent.

224
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,725
It's the least I could do..

225
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:40,096
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

226
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,639
They're not subtle.

227
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,398
Well, I'll just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

228
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,841
Yeah, I'm not looking for..

229
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,219
But, I'm still grateful
that you're not a creep.

230
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,883
Hey, let's not jump
to any conclusions there.

231
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,508
I had kind of an internal
debate about showing you the mirror.

232
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,354
Shouting on both sides.
Blood was spilled.

233
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,302
So, you're bleeding internally?

234
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,830
Pretty bad.

235
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:06,250
Well, Jules is pre-med.
You should probably talk to her.

236
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,990
Okay.

237
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,384
Wow.

238
00:17:53,884 --> 00:18:01,366
Yeah, I don't think so.

239
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,336
Places everyone.

240
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:33,854
We are live.

241
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,200
Engineering, we got a room change.

242
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,855
Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.

243
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:41,439
Operations, do you copy?
We need a scenario adjustment.

244
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,692
Miss Lin.

245
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:48,886
We've got the blood work
back on Louden. Her levels are good.

246
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,181
But we're recommending
a fifty-milligram bump..

247
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:53,084
of Rhohyptase to increase libido.

248
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,775
- Sold. - Do we pipe it in,
or do you wanna do it orally?

249
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:58,406
Ask me that again, only slower.

250
00:18:58,407 --> 00:18:59,275
You're a pig.

251
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:02,256
Guess how we're
slowing down cognition.

252
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:03,048
I don't know.

253
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,563
The hair dye.

254
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:08,316
Dumb blonde. Very artistic.

255
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:12,713
Works its way into the blood,
through the scalp. Very gradual.

256
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:16,016
Chem department keeps their end up.

257
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,731
I'll see it when I believe it.

258
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,343
Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.

259
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,644
I have the harbinger on line two.

260
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:25,032
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

261
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:28,746
I don't think so. He's really pushy.

262
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,663
To be honest,
he's kind of freaking me out.

263
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:34,417
Okay. Put him on.

264
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,122
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?
How's the weather up top?

265
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:42,511
The lambs have passed through the gate.
They are come to the killing floor.

266
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:44,788
Well, you're doing
a great job out there.

267
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,055
By the numbers, man.
You got us started off just right.

268
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,772
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?

269
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,209
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

270
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,271
Their ears are stopped.

271
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:57,444
They are the gods' fools.

272
00:19:57,445 --> 00:20:00,673
Well, that's.. how it works.

273
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:04,618
Cleanse them. Cleanse the
world of their ignorance and sin.

274
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,208
Bathe them in the crimson of..

275
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:09,403
Am I on speakerphone?

276
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:12,814
No. Absolutely not.

277
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:14,795
Speakerphone, no.
No, I wouldn't do that.

278
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,915
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

279
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,477
Oh, my God. You're right.
Hang on one second, I'll take you off.

280
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:23,315
That's rude.
I don't know who's in the room.

281
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,297
Fine. There. You're off.

282
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:27,444
Thank you.

283
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,662
Don't take this lightly, boy.

284
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,453
It wasn't all by your numbers.

285
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:37,154
The fool nearly derailed
the invocation with his insolence.

286
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:39,914
The ancient ones see everything.

287
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:41,427
And they will not be..

288
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,123
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?

289
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:48,333
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

290
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:51,093
I can't believe it. I did it again!

291
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:52,337
Mordy?

292
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:55,096
What happens next?

293
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,335
Oh! That's cold!

294
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:08,789
How cold? Is it worth it?

295
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,430
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.

296
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:14,665
Yeah, I might just risk
lying out in the sun for a while.

297
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,951
Boo.

298
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:18,027
Hey, what is that?
- What?

299
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,462
In the lake, right there.

300
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,493
Oh, come on. - No you guys,
I'm serious. Right there.

301
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:24,309
There! There!
God, looks just like my girlfriend!

302
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,210
Oh, my God!

303
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:29,921
There's something else in the lake!

304
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:34,644
It's a gorgeous man!
- I'm gonna kill you!

305
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:37,095
Don't kill the gorgeous man!
We're endangered!

306
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,509
All right. Last chance.

307
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:50,366
It's post time. Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing. Okay.

308
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,251
Okay, who's still out?

309
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:55,709
Let's see. We got engineering,
we got R & D, and we got electrical.

310
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,258
Did you see who they picked?

311
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,625
They're practically
giving their money away.

312
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,662
You should talk, Aquaman.

313
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:02,919
What do you mean?
- Ah, nothing.

314
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,209
Okay, all right.

315
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,587
I'm not even sure
we have one of these.

316
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:08,861
Zoology swears we do.

317
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,938
They'd know. Okay. All right, people.

318
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,089
Hey, what do you got?

319
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,358
No, they've already been picked.

320
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,208
What? No. Who took them?

321
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,220
Maintenance.

322
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,209
Maintenance?
They pick the same thing every year.

323
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,272
What do you want from me?

324
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,877
If they were creative,
they wouldn't be in maintenance.

325
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:25,000
You're gonna have to split
this if you win. You wanna switch?

326
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,692
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think?

327
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:32,680
More than anything,
I just want this moment to end.

328
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:38,282
Not betting?

329
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:39,583
Not for me. Thanks.

330
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,913
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?

331
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:45,436
It's just people letting off steam.

332
00:22:47,384 --> 00:22:50,567
This job isn't easy,
however those clowns may behave.

333
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:55,017
Does the director.
Do they know about this downstairs?

334
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:56,388
The director doesn't
care about this stuff.

335
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,166
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs..

336
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,108
as long as the kids
do as they're told.

337
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,490
But then it's fixed.

338
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:03,198
No, no, no.

339
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:06,446
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

340
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:09,214
No, we just get 'em in the cellar.
They take it from there.

341
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:11,412
No, they have to make the
choice of their own free will.

342
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:13,309
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

343
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,269
It's like the harbinger.

344
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,964
It's this creepy old fuck, practically
wears a sign, "You will die."

345
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,971
Why do we put him there? The system.

346
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:24,489
They have to choose to ignore him..

347
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,835
and they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.

348
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:28,837
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to..

349
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:31,006
but in the end,
they don't transgress..

350
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:32,305
hey can't be punished.

351
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:35,993
So what's it gonna be, Truman?
You in? Window's closing.

352
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:39,910
I'm fine.

353
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:43,148
Okay.

354
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,643
That's it, gang!

355
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:46,238
The board is locked!

356
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,623
Oh, let's get this party started!

357
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:51,117
Let's get this party started!

358
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:03,442
There you go.

359
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,464
Okay, my turn.

360
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:06,616
Jules.

361
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:11,386
Truth or dare?

362
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:12,576
Let's go dare.

363
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:13,897
All right.

364
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:17,798
I dare you to make out with..

365
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,701
Please say "Dana," please say "Dana."

366
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,464
That moose, over there.

367
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:24,559
Marty..

368
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,307
have you ever seen a moose before?

369
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,584
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

370
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:33,152
That's a wolf.

371
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:37,266
I'm living in a womb of reefer,
leave me alone.

372
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,346
Jules..

373
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:42,230
I dare you to make out with that wolf.

374
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,482
No problem.

375
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:10,713
Who?

376
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:12,683
Me?

377
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:15,372
Well, yes, I am new in town.

378
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:17,388
How did you know?

379
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,636
Oh, my God.
That is so sweet of you to say.

380
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:23,597
I just colored it, in fact.

381
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:24,999
No, no, no.

382
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,392
There's no need to huff and puff.

383
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,585
I'll let you come in.

384
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,153
Thank you.

385
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:11,801
Yeah.

386
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:20,291
Now,...

387
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:21,340
Dana.

388
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:22,321
Truth.

389
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:25,166
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,704
I'm just skipping ahead.

391
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:28,820
You're gonna say dare.

392
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,571
She's gonna dare you to
do something you don't like..

393
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:34,827
and then you'll puss out and
say that you wanted truth all along.

394
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:36,394
Really?

395
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,546
Okay, Jules.

396
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,413
Dare.

397
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:43,677
What the hell was that?

398
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:45,726
It's the cellar door.

399
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,846
The wind must've blown it open.

400
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,782
That makes what kinda sense?

401
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,517
What do you think is down there?

402
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,375
Why don't we find out?

403
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:03,009
Dana.

404
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:05,757
I dare you.

405
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:24,487
How long do I have to stay down here?

406
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,689
Oh, you know, just 'til morning.

407
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:02,958
Dana.

408
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:06,218
You okay?

409
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,653
Yeah.

410
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,156
Sorry, I just scared myself.

411
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,557
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare.

412
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:16,292
Take your top off.

413
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,761
What?

414
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,587
I don't make up the rules.

415
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,053
Oh, my God.

416
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,140
Look at all this.

417
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:33,302
Guys..

418
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:38,082
I'm not sure it's
awesome to be down here.

419
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,072
Guys?

420
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:45,041
Dude, seriously,
your cousin is into some weird shit.

421
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:47,782
I'm pretty sure this ain't his.

422
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:51,704
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

423
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:57,929
Some of this stuff looks really old.

424
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,878
It's beautiful.

425
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,480
Maybe we should go back upstairs.

426
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:13,164
I dare you all to go upstairs.

427
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:08,282
Guys?

428
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:11,483
Guys, listen to this.

429
00:30:11,484 --> 00:30:14,034
"April fourth.

430
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:18,287
"Father was cross with me
and said I lacked the true faith.

431
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:21,246
"I wish I could prove my devotion..

432
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:23,797
"as Judah and Matthew
proved on those travelers."

433
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:24,776
What is that?

434
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:31,152
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.

435
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:34,720
"Mama screamed most of the night.

436
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:37,342
"I prayed that she might find faith..

437
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:40,258
"but she only stopped
when Papa cut her belly..

438
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:41,753
"and stuffed the coals in.

439
00:30:41,755 --> 00:30:44,159
"Judah told me in my dream..

440
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,325
"that Matthew took him to the
black room, so I know he is killed.

441
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:53,471
"I want to understand the
glory of the pain like Matthew..

442
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:59,733
"but cutting the flesh makes
him have a husband's bulge..

443
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,596
"and I do not get like that."

444
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:04,201
- Jesus. Can we not?
- No. Go on.

445
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:05,551
- Why?
-I want to know.

446
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:07,166
"I have found it..

447
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:11,678
"in the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

448
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,537
"My good arm is hacked up..

449
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,750
"and et,
so I hope this will be readable.

450
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,388
"That a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits.

451
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,288
"Then we will be restored
and the great pain will return."

452
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:30,713
And then there's something in Latin.

453
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:34,280
Okay, I'm drawing a line
in the fucking sand, here.

454
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:35,740
Do not read the Latin.

455
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:39,707
What the fuck?

456
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,805
- Dolor..
- No, no.

457
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:45,135
- Stop being a fucking baby.
- Curt!

458
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,046
It's a diary.

459
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:48,055
It doesn't even mean anything.

460
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:51,865
- Dana!
- "Dolor supervivo caro.

461
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:56,560
"Dolor sublimis caro.

462
00:31:56,561 --> 00:32:01,179
"Dolor ignio annivos."

463
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:33,214
We have a winner!

464
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:35,663
It's the Buckners,
ladies and gentlemen!

465
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:38,236
The Buckners pull a 'W'.

466
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:44,672
All right. That means that
congratulations go to Maintenance!

467
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:48,472
Who share the pot
with Ronald the intern.

468
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:49,348
Yeah!

469
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:51,348
That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

470
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:53,426
Yes, you did. You had zombies.

471
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:56,847
But this is
"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see?

472
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:58,780
They're entirely separate species.

473
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:01,596
Like the difference between
an elephant and an elephant seal.

474
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,280
There's always next year.

475
00:33:05,074 --> 00:33:07,693
They're like something
from a nightmare.

476
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,796
No. They're something
nightmares are from.

477
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:15,990
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world..

478
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:19,875
courtesy of you-know-who.

479
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,147
Monsters. Magic.

480
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:23,590
Gods.

481
00:33:23,592 --> 00:33:25,384
You get used to it.

482
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,984
Should you?

483
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,641
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

484
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,759
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know.

485
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,789
A couple more minutes,
who knows what might've happened?

486
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,038
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.

487
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:48,318
Dude, be thankful.

488
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,903
Those things are terrifying.

489
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,373
And the cleanup on
them is a nightmare.

490
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:57,084
So, the Buckners.

491
00:33:57,085 --> 00:34:00,880
Yeah, well, they may be zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots..

492
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:04,391
But they're our zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

493
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:06,585
With a hundred percent clearance rate.

494
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,307
True. So should we call Japan?

495
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:11,226
Tell them to take the
rest of the weekend off?

496
00:34:11,228 --> 00:34:14,164
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.
What are they gonna do? Relax?

497
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:16,679
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses, for once.

498
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,708
Oh, God, don't even joke.

499
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,550
Every other branch has air-balled.

500
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,661
We need the Japanese crew to get it
done. There's too much riding on this.

501
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:06,965
Fuck, yeah, baby.

502
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:09,353
This is so classy.

503
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:11,626
Come on, like you wouldn't
want a piece of that.

504
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:15,085
Can we not talk about people
in pieces any more tonight?

505
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:19,032
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?

506
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,786
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

507
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:27,074
We made out once.

508
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:30,106
I never did buy that ring.

509
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:32,001
But we're still..

510
00:35:34,222 --> 00:35:35,630
close.

511
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,733
I have a theory about all this.

512
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:44,659
That's our cue to bail.

513
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:48,492
Tommy Chong here has a theory.
Come on, baby.

514
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:52,184
Don't worry,
you can tell it to Egghead, here..

515
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:54,364
if he's not too busy
devirginizing Dana.

516
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:57,407
Jules, do you wanna go lie down?

517
00:35:57,409 --> 00:36:01,050
That's exactly the point.
Come on. Mush. Mush.

518
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,097
Don't push me around.

519
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,509
Not around, baby. Straight line.

520
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:28,097
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

521
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:30,420
Conspiracy?

522
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:33,344
The way everybody's acting.

523
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:36,697
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?

524
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:41,268
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

525
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:44,463
I mean, he's a sociology major.

526
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:46,630
He's on full academic scholarship..

527
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,436
and now he's calling
his friend an egghead?

528
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,201
Curt's just drunk.

529
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:53,465
I've seen Curt drunk.

530
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:56,284
Jules, too.

531
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:58,413
Well, then, maybe it's something else.

532
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:03,449
You're not seeing
what you don't wanna see.

533
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,576
Puppeteers.

534
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:09,755
Puppeteers?

535
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:10,925
Pop-Tarts?

536
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:12,360
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

537
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:16,168
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

538
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,876
We are not who we are.

539
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:28,655
I'm gonna go read
a book with pictures.

540
00:37:28,657 --> 00:37:32,972
Thank you.
- "The pain outlives the flesh.

541
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:37,117
"The flesh returns.. "
or "has a meeting place."

542
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,260
What is that?

543
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:41,175
The Latin that you
read in the basement.

544
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:41,934
You speak Latin?

545
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:46,114
Not well. Not since tenth grade.

546
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:48,594
Weird how it all comes back.

547
00:37:48,594 --> 00:37:51,179
Well, it's a weird kind of night.

548
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,074
I'm sorry about tonight.

549
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:55,766
Everybody..

550
00:37:55,768 --> 00:37:59,715
Do I lose points if I tell
you I'm having a pretty nice time?

551
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:04,733
No. You can tell me that.

552
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:12,585
What are you running away for?

553
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:21,322
Don't spill on me!

554
00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:22,847
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?

555
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,130
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?

556
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:30,836
Not here.

557
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:33,329
Baby, come on.

558
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:35,315
We're all alone.

559
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:46,958
I'm chilly.

560
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:52,161
Okay, guys. That's it.
Let's go. We've got a job to do.

561
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:55,065
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

562
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,454
- Do we have temperature
control in this sector? - On it.

563
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:05,358
Engaging pheromone mists.

564
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,563
It's so dark.

565
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:34,987
Take me inside?

566
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:36,632
Come on. This is why we came here.

567
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:40,353
It's romantic.

568
00:39:57,356 --> 00:40:01,842
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

569
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:03,692
Show us the goods.

570
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,487
Does it really matter if we see her..

571
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,516
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

572
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:10,731
Gotta keep the customer satisfied.

573
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,922
You understand what's at stake, here?

574
00:40:58,617 --> 00:40:59,677
Score.

575
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:33,675
Jules!

576
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:52,193
This we offer in humility and fear.

577
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:55,985
For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

578
00:42:55,985 --> 00:42:58,197
As it ever was.

579
00:42:58,199 --> 00:42:59,315
As it ever was.

580
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,132
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

581
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:59,047
I'm gonna go for a walk.

582
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:02,518
Okay. I swear to fucking God,
somebody is talking.

583
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:10,244
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

584
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:13,231
I'm gonna go for a walk.

585
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,994
Enough!

586
00:44:14,994 --> 00:44:16,878
What are you saying?

587
00:44:16,878 --> 00:44:19,306
What do you want?

588
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:23,905
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

589
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:26,536
You think I'm a puppet.
Gonna do a little..

590
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,237
fucking puppet dance!

591
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:32,300
I'm the boss of my own brain,
so give it up.

592
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:38,420
I'm gonna go for a walk.

593
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:50,777
I don't wanna..

594
00:44:50,777 --> 00:44:52,398
I mean, I've never..

595
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,135
I don't mean "never"..

596
00:44:56,135 --> 00:44:57,030
Hey.

597
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,226
Nothing you don't want.

598
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:05,617
He's got a husband bulge.

599
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,079
I thought there'd be stars.

600
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,380
We are abandoned.

601
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,556
- Fuck!
- Fucking run!

602
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,496
Curt!

603
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,496
Dead bitch!

604
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,621
Jesus, what happened?

605
00:46:10,822 --> 00:46:11,574
The fuck!

606
00:46:11,576 --> 00:46:12,998
Curt, what the fuck?

607
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,143
Where are you hurt?

608
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:15,534
Is all of this from you?

609
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:17,527
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

610
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:18,855
Where's Jules?

611
00:46:20,496 --> 00:46:23,538
She's gone.

612
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,231
We've gotta get out of here.

613
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:29,865
No. No.

614
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:30,806
Dana, don't open that..

615
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:32,293
I'm not leaving here without Jules.

616
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:33,929
That dead girl's out there!

617
00:46:57,393 --> 00:46:58,501
Dana, come on!

618
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:04,309
What is that thing?

619
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:05,469
Fuck!

620
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,824
I don't know,
but there's more of them.

621
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,856
More of them?

622
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:09,639
I saw a young girl.

623
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:11,407
All zombied like him..

624
00:47:11,409 --> 00:47:13,427
but she was missing an arm.

625
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:17,117
Oh, my God. Patience.

626
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,023
The diary.

627
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:21,630
- We gotta lock this place down.
-He's right.

628
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,813
We'll go room by room.
Barricade every window and door.

629
00:47:24,815 --> 00:47:28,677
We gotta play it safe. No matter what
happens, we have to stay together.

630
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,429
Fuck!

631
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:32,416
Calm down.

632
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,692
Watch the master work.

633
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:46,880
This isn't right.

634
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,579
What? What's the matter?

635
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:52,204
This isn't right. We should split up.

636
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:55,135
We can cover more ground that way.

637
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,617
Yeah.

638
00:47:58,085 --> 00:47:59,586
Yeah. Good idea.

639
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:01,969
Really?

640
00:48:04,168 --> 00:48:05,606
All right,
you guys, get in your rooms.

641
00:48:09,608 --> 00:48:10,860
Lock them in.

642
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,699
What the fuck?

643
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,876
What the..?

644
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:44,364
What the fuck?

645
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:46,007
That's not good.

646
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,967
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

647
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:51,110
Chem department,
I need 500 CCs of Thorazine..

648
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:52,420
pumped into room three.

649
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,496
No, no, no.

650
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:54,596
Stand by, Chem.

651
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:57,860
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

652
00:49:01,342 --> 00:49:02,461
What the fuck?

653
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,219
Fuck! What the fuck?

654
00:49:11,063 --> 00:49:13,018
Oh, my God.

655
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,139
I'm on a reality TV show.

656
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:23,826
My parents are gonna
think I'm such a burnout.

657
00:50:11,018 --> 00:50:15,199
Help me! Help me!

658
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:43,228
Must be getting excited downstairs.

659
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,286
Greatest show on Earth.

660
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:04,121
Somebody help!

661
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,038
Come on!

662
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,762
Use the bed!
- Come on! Come on!

663
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:37,463
It's empty.
- Go.

664
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,693
Curt?
- Unlock the door.

665
00:51:41,596 --> 00:51:43,822
I can't. Get down to the basement.

666
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:03,416
This is the black room.

667
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:05,101
Nice.

668
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:09,244
From the diary.

669
00:52:11,311 --> 00:52:13,211
This is where he killed them.

670
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:17,222
This is where he kills us.

671
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:19,278
No way. No.

672
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,972
He's not gonna kill us

673
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:23,070
We just gotta find a door.

674
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:24,684
Okay?

675
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,012
Let's just check the walls, okay?

676
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:32,577
Curt?

677
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:34,480
I mean, there's gotta be..

678
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:52,773
You like pain?

679
00:52:56,956 --> 00:52:58,362
How's that work for you?

680
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:23,791
These fucking zombies.

681
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,163
Remember when you could
just throw a girl in a volcano?

682
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:26,655
How old do you think I am?

683
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,121
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

684
00:53:50,172 --> 00:53:51,027
What about Marty?

685
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:52,552
They got him.

686
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:31,385
The devil is defeated.

687
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:34,880
Now Kiko's spirit will
live in the happy frog!

688
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:45,139
Fuck you!

689
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:49,110
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

690
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:52,956
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

691
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:55,686
The Japan crew should've
had this in the bag. They fucked us.

692
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,266
How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds?

693
00:54:57,235 --> 00:54:59,610
Zero fatality. Total wash.

694
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:04,088
You want good product,
you gotta buy American.

695
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,355
Any word from downstairs?

696
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:09,048
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.
The director trusts us.

697
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,963
You just sweat the chem, Lin.

698
00:55:10,963 --> 00:55:13,820
While these morons are singing
What a Friend We Have in Shinto..

699
00:55:13,822 --> 00:55:15,880
we are bringing the pain.

700
00:55:15,882 --> 00:55:18,199
Yeah, and what the fuck's
up with this guy's pot, anyway?

701
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:21,125
He's supposed to be drooling
and instead he almost makes us?

702
00:55:21,126 --> 00:55:22,532
We treated the shit out of it.

703
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:24,744
Okay, we've got the Rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

704
00:55:24,746 --> 00:55:26,614
The fool's toast anyway.

705
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:29,554
And so are we if you
don't get this under control.

706
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:32,335
Shit.
- What? "Shit" why?

707
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:33,474
Gotta go. Work to do.

708
00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:35,699
You guys are humanity's last hope.
If the ancients rise..

709
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:38,518
There's no cave-in.
- What?

710
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:39,989
The fucking tunnel's open!

711
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,804
- Control to Demolition.
- We're dark on the whole sector.

712
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:44,137
Try to bypass it.

713
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:46,105
- What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
-Open the door.

714
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,490
Look out!
Get out of the way! Make a hole!

715
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,418
What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

716
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:06,965
Electrical said there
was a glitch up top.

717
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:09,503
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.
-We didn't get the order.

718
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:24,329
Hadley, what is going on?

719
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:26,864
Hadley?

720
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:29,233
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

721
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:23,793
No, no. No fucking way!

722
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:28,023
Can't believe this, man.
This ain't happening.

723
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:31,815
It's right there.

724
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,306
All right.
We got any climbing gear? Ropes?

725
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:36,509
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

726
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,146
We can't go back.

727
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:40,016
There's no way across.

728
00:57:40,018 --> 00:57:41,623
What're we gonna do? Jump?

729
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,655
Dude.

730
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:46,226
What?

731
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:53,998
Curt, are you sure about this?

732
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,286
I've done bigger jumps than this.

733
00:57:55,286 --> 00:57:56,699
You've got a smooth run..

734
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:59,023
and maybe a five foot
differential on the other side.

735
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:00,903
But you've gotta give it everything.

736
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:02,896
Curt.

737
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:07,865
Look, you guys,
you stay in the Rambler.

738
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:09,143
I'll get help.

739
00:58:09,144 --> 00:58:12,391
If I wipe out,
I'll fucking limp for help.

740
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:14,568
But I'm coming back here.

741
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:17,871
I'm coming back with
cops and choppers..

742
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:21,344
and large fucking guns,
and those things are gonna pay.

743
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,661
For Jules.

744
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:35,099
Don't hold back.

745
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:38,134
Never do.

746
00:59:03,342 --> 00:59:04,985
No!

747
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:08,018
Curt!

748
00:59:08,322 --> 00:59:09,228
Oh, God!

749
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:20,293
He hit something.
There's nothing. What'd he hit?

750
00:59:22,534 --> 00:59:23,722
Puppeteers.

751
00:59:25,197 --> 00:59:27,666
Marty was right.

752
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,521
Get in the van.

753
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:33,030
Dana.

754
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:40,416
Marty was right.

755
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,681
You're going back.

756
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,398
I'm going through.

757
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:05,922
And we'll just drive.
There's gotta be another road.

758
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:07,498
Another way out of here.
-It won't work.

759
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:13,028
Something will happen.
It will collapse, it will wash away.

760
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,922
Then we just leave
the roads altogether.

761
01:00:14,922 --> 01:00:19,896
Drive as far as we can into the
forest and we go on foot from there.

762
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:23,567
You're missing the point.

763
01:00:23,568 --> 01:00:28,208
Please, do not go nuts on me,
okay, Dana? You're all I've got, now.

764
01:00:31,934 --> 01:00:33,635
I'm okay.

765
01:00:33,637 --> 01:00:35,514
Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm.

766
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:36,514
Okay, no matter what happens,
we gotta stay..

767
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:38,710
Goddamn, that was close!

768
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:40,510
Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

769
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,791
I don't understand.

770
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,536
You're celebrating?

771
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:46,490
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.

772
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:48,280
But she's still alive.

773
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,096
How can the ritual be complete?

774
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:52,081
The virgin's death is optional,
as long as it's last.

775
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,659
Main thing is that she suffers.

776
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:56,659
That she did.

777
01:01:58,626 --> 01:02:00,673
It's so strange.

778
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:04,007
I'm actually rooting for this girl.

779
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:06,177
She's got so much heart.

780
01:02:06,177 --> 01:02:09,936
And you think of
all the pain and the..

781
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:14,659
Tequila is my lady! My lady!

782
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:17,326
Come on in, guys!
Come on in. You're welcome.

783
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:20,896
Tequila!
From darkness, there is light!

784
01:03:28,114 --> 01:03:29,951
I wish that I could do what you do.

785
01:03:29,952 --> 01:03:32,186
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it's masterful.

786
01:03:32,186 --> 01:03:35,664
I don't know.
Tonight was solid. I don't know.

787
01:03:35,664 --> 01:03:38,697
Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
When the van hits the lake..

788
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:39,565
I screamed.

789
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:42,112
And the water rushing in,
and the zombies..

790
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,601
just think it would've
been cooler with a merman.

791
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:47,170
Do you know if we get
the overtime bonus on this one?

792
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,672
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

793
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:52,206
I don't need to.
I already know the answer.

794
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:53,228
I'm an intern.

795
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:57,900
So I don't qualify for OT.

796
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,119
It's funny that you like the ballet..

797
01:04:00,121 --> 01:04:04,778
because I happen to have
two tickets to your favorite..

798
01:04:06,945 --> 01:04:08,699
You knuckleheads.

799
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:10,983
You almost gave me a
heart attack with that tunnel.

800
01:04:10,983 --> 01:04:13,706
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

801
01:04:13,706 --> 01:04:15,898
I'm just giving you a hard time.

802
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,106
Come on. Give us a hug.

803
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,273
No, seriously. That wasn't our fault.

804
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:24,063
There was a glitch.
Power re-route from upstairs.

805
01:04:25,463 --> 01:04:27,670
What do you mean, upstairs?

806
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:42,125
Turn the fucking music off.

807
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,023
Hello?

808
01:04:58,023 --> 01:05:01,088
That's impossible. Everything
was done within the guidelines.

809
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,740
The virgin's the only one..

810
01:05:02,742 --> 01:05:06,150
No. I am not doubting you.

811
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:10,485
Which one?

812
01:05:52,568 --> 01:05:54,148
Marty.
-Hi.

813
01:06:00,632 --> 01:06:01,914
Dana, come on.

814
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:28,800
Marty. Wait.

815
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,206
We're going in the grave?

816
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:34,617
Dana, come on!

817
01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:52,045
What is this place?

818
01:06:55,416 --> 01:07:01,291
Yeah. I had to dismember
that guy with a trowel.

819
01:07:03,373 --> 01:07:04,652
What have you been up to?

820
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,427
Nobody else, huh?

821
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:20,413
Yeah, I figured.

822
01:07:21,965 --> 01:07:24,047
You figured everything.

823
01:07:24,047 --> 01:07:25,757
Oh, not at all.

824
01:07:25,759 --> 01:07:29,242
But, I do know some stuff.

825
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:30,871
As in..

826
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:38,067
It's an elevator.

827
01:07:38,068 --> 01:07:42,230
Somebody sent those dead
fucks up here to get us.

828
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:47,514
Now, there's no controls inside, but
there's maintenance overrides in there.

829
01:07:47,514 --> 01:07:50,025
And I think I can get it to go down.

830
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:52,969
Do we wanna go down?

831
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,480
Where else are we gonna go?

832
01:08:00,865 --> 01:08:04,692
Come on. Get in.

833
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:18,152
Come on!

834
01:08:18,014 --> 01:08:19,350
Fucking zombie arm.

835
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:30,814
We chose.

836
01:10:31,363 --> 01:10:33,582
What? What?

837
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:49,876
All that shit we were playing with.

838
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:51,981
They made us choose.

839
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:56,195
They made us choose how we die.

840
01:11:34,662 --> 01:11:36,837
We saw them go down the access drop.
They have to be in one of these.

841
01:11:37,546 --> 01:11:38,978
Internal security can..

842
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:42,447
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

843
01:11:42,448 --> 01:11:43,729
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.

844
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:46,203
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

845
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:47,684
Take him out first.

846
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,940
Cleanup says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

847
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:52,976
Whatever he's been smoking's
been immunizing him to all our shit.

848
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:54,756
How does that help us right now? What?

849
01:11:54,628 --> 01:11:57,783
No, if you have a confirmed kill,
take her out, too.

850
01:11:57,497 --> 01:11:58,502
There.

851
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:01,430
3606.

852
01:12:01,873 --> 01:12:02,876
Gotcha.

853
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,362
Bring 'em down.

854
01:12:23,676 --> 01:12:26,408
Step out of the elevator!
Step out of the elevator!

855
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,728
Why are you trying to kill us?
- Step out! Just the girl!

856
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:30,472
- What?
-Just me?

857
01:12:30,203 --> 01:12:31,216
Do it!

858
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:43,801
Good work, zombie arm.

859
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,443
You shouldn't be here.

860
01:13:11,533 --> 01:13:14,789
This should've gone differently.

861
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:17,685
Ended more quickly.

862
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:21,980
I can only imagine
your pain and confusion.

863
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,725
But know this.

864
01:13:23,726 --> 01:13:28,042
What's happening to you
is part of something bigger.

865
01:13:28,043 --> 01:13:30,520
Something older than anything known.

866
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,734
You've seen horrible things.

867
01:13:34,735 --> 01:13:37,568
An army of nightmare creatures.

868
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:40,909
But they are nothing
compared to what came before.

869
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:43,251
What lies below.

870
01:13:44,775 --> 01:13:48,724
It's our task to placate
the ancient ones.

871
01:13:50,173 --> 01:13:52,917
As it's yours to
be offered up to them.

872
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:55,707
Forgive us.

873
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:57,822
And let us get it over with.

874
01:13:57,823 --> 01:14:01,154
Come on. Go in that room.

875
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,043
Army of nightmares, huh?

876
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:35,863
Let's get this party started.

877
01:14:37,743 --> 01:14:38,637
Hold fire!

878
01:14:53,306 --> 01:14:54,497
Oh, shit.

879
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:12,109
Go! Go! Go!

880
01:16:24,673 --> 01:16:26,422
Lead officer Truman
to security command.

881
01:16:26,423 --> 01:16:30,663
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat, code black.

882
01:16:30,664 --> 01:16:32,448
Where the fuck are you guys?

883
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:36,153
Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down.

884
01:16:36,154 --> 01:16:37,993
Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ!

885
01:16:38,287 --> 01:16:40,228
Why aren't the defenses working?
Where's the fucking gas?

886
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:42,851
Something chewed through the
connections in the utility shaft.

887
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:44,935
Something which?
- Something scary!

888
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:19,939
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there.

889
01:17:43,631 --> 01:17:45,161
Go, go, go!

890
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,488
Fuck! We're running out of time!

891
01:18:37,644 --> 01:18:39,136
It's on lockdown,
I'm trying to bypass.

892
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:54,077
Hadley!

893
01:19:25,003 --> 01:19:27,405
Oh, come on!

894
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,779
It's you.

895
01:20:11,414 --> 01:20:17,219
No, no, no. Please, please.

896
01:20:21,195 --> 01:20:22,908
Kill him.

897
01:20:31,429 --> 01:20:32,532
Okay, Dana, come on.

898
01:20:32,533 --> 01:20:34,021
Dana.

899
01:20:37,108 --> 01:20:39,591
Here. It's easier with this.

900
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:45,716
Look at these.

901
01:21:48,444 --> 01:21:50,546
Five of them.

902
01:21:50,546 --> 01:21:52,408
What are they?

903
01:21:55,283 --> 01:21:56,581
Us.

904
01:21:56,582 --> 01:21:59,190
I should have seen it like you did.

905
01:22:01,024 --> 01:22:03,442
This is part of a ritual.

906
01:22:03,443 --> 01:22:06,363
A ritual sacrifice?

907
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,743
Great.

908
01:22:09,743 --> 01:22:15,819
You tie someone to a stone, get a
fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

909
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:18,274
Is that that complicated?
- No.

910
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:19,626
It's simple.

911
01:22:19,627 --> 01:22:22,337
They don't just want to see us killed.

912
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,069
They want to see us punished.

913
01:22:28,427 --> 01:22:29,773
Punished for what?

914
01:22:29,774 --> 01:22:32,243
For being young.

915
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:41,063
It's different in every culture.

916
01:22:41,064 --> 01:22:43,493
And it has changed over the years..

917
01:22:43,493 --> 01:22:46,537
but it has always required youth.

918
01:22:46,538 --> 01:22:49,862
There must be at least five.

919
01:22:51,076 --> 01:22:52,846
The whore.

920
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,577
She's corrupted.

921
01:22:54,578 --> 01:22:56,216
She dies first.

922
01:22:56,217 --> 01:22:59,192
The athlete.

923
01:22:59,193 --> 01:23:02,390
The scholar.

924
01:23:03,489 --> 01:23:05,345
The fool.

925
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:08,801
All suffer and die at the hands of..

926
01:23:08,801 --> 01:23:11,278
whatever horror they have raised..

927
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:15,127
leaving the last, to live or die..

928
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:17,539
.. as fate decides.

929
01:23:19,734 --> 01:23:21,300
The virgin.

930
01:23:22,822 --> 01:23:24,336
Me?

931
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:26,390
Virgin?

932
01:23:26,391 --> 01:23:28,795
We work with what we have.

933
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:31,595
But what if you don't pull it off?

934
01:23:31,596 --> 01:23:32,539
They rise.

935
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:33,631
Who does?

936
01:23:34,945 --> 01:23:36,993
What's beneath us?

937
01:23:36,994 --> 01:23:38,422
The ancient ones.

938
01:23:38,423 --> 01:23:40,954
The gods that used to rule the Earth.

939
01:23:40,956 --> 01:23:45,140
As long as they accept
our sacrifice, they remain below.

940
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:48,072
But the other rituals have all failed.

941
01:23:49,943 --> 01:23:52,346
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

942
01:23:53,173 --> 01:23:56,551
If you live to see it,
the world will end.

943
01:23:56,552 --> 01:23:59,014
Maybe that's the way it should be.

944
01:23:59,015 --> 01:24:02,412
If you've got to kill all
my friends to survive..

945
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:04,512
maybe it's time for a change.

946
01:24:04,514 --> 01:24:06,511
We're not talking about change.

947
01:24:06,511 --> 01:24:11,628
We're talking about the agonizing death
of every human soul on the planet.

948
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,372
Including you.

949
01:24:13,373 --> 01:24:15,230
You can die with them..

950
01:24:17,115 --> 01:24:19,604
or you can die for them.

951
01:24:22,136 --> 01:24:24,788
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

952
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:45,868
The whole world, Marty.

953
01:24:45,868 --> 01:24:48,037
Is in your hands, Dana.

954
01:24:48,038 --> 01:24:50,747
There is no other way.

955
01:24:50,747 --> 01:24:53,592
You have to be strong.

956
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:56,167
Yeah, Dana..

957
01:24:57,501 --> 01:24:59,230
you feeling strong?

958
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,768
I'm sorry.

959
01:25:07,225 --> 01:25:08,247
So am I.

960
01:25:51,845 --> 01:25:53,123
Marty..

961
01:25:58,337 --> 01:25:59,734
Marty!

962
01:26:52,865 --> 01:26:55,087
Hey.

963
01:26:58,314 --> 01:27:00,096
You know..

964
01:27:03,827 --> 01:27:06,100
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

965
01:27:13,523 --> 01:27:15,574
How are you?

966
01:27:19,202 --> 01:27:20,967
Going away.

967
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:27,063
I'm sorry.

968
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:31,145
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

969
01:27:31,146 --> 01:27:34,413
I probably wouldn't have.

970
01:27:34,414 --> 01:27:36,190
Hey, no. No.

971
01:27:38,871 --> 01:27:39,972
I totally get it.

972
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:57,320
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by
a werewolf and then ended the world.

973
01:27:58,863 --> 01:27:59,692
No.

974
01:28:01,143 --> 01:28:02,962
Hey, you were right.

975
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,182
Humanity..

976
01:28:12,932 --> 01:28:16,070
It's time to give
someone else a chance.

977
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,613
Giant evil gods.

978
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:38,784
I wish I could've seen them.

979
01:28:38,786 --> 01:28:40,240
I know.

980
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:45,627
That would have been a fun weekend.

981
01:28:45,628 --> 01:29:20,849
