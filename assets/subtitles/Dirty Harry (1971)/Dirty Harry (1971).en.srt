1
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,393
Jesus!

2
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:45,896
"To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:49,524
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

4
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:52,819
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

5
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,197
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,451
...at personal column,
<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>...

7
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:01,536
...and I will set up meeting.

8
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:03,413
If I do not hear from you...

9
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:07,292
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a..."

10
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:11,254
"Scorpio."

11
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,176
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,677
Kooks.

13
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:21,848
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

14
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,560
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,690
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:33,818
Instead, we pay a police department.

17
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,238
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:40,283
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

19
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,831
Send Inspector Callahan in.

20
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,419
Callahan?

21
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:55,006
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

22
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,383
All right.

23
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,801
Let's have it.

24
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,347
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

25
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,224
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,394
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

27
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,523
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

28
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,320
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

29
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,582
There's a madman loose.

30
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,086
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

31
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:39,384
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

32
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:43,221
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

33
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:44,681
...rifle nuts, peepers...

34
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,516
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,811
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

36
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,648
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

37
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,442
...and in the black area.

38
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,986
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

39
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,612
We're sure it's a 30-06.

40
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:02,741
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

41
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,617
We're running a computer check...

42
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:08,705
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

43
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,498
...October 23 and November 21.

44
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:11,750
Why?

45
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:13,793
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,005
Thank you, inspector.

47
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,592
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

48
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,637
How about you?

49
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,097
Nobody.

50
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,183
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?

51
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,684
Nobody.

52
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:35,982
All right. Give the message
to the <i>Chronicle</i>.

53
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,527
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

54
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,738
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:43,740
You'll play this creep's game?

56
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:45,784
It'll give us breathing space.

57
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,078
It might get somebody killed.

58
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,872
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:54,793
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

60
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,837
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

61
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,965
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

62
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:11,351
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

63
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,603
That's my policy.

64
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,148
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

65
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,695
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

66
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:23,571
Intent?

67
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:25,490
How did you establish that?

68
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,163
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

69
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:35,875
...I figure he isn't out collecting
for the Red Cross.

70
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,589
I think he's got a point.

71
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,481
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

72
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,232
Usual.

73
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,486
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

74
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,237
What difference does it make?

75
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:48,490
Not much.

76
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,452
Hey, Jaffe...

77
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,456
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

78
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,793
Tan Ford?

79
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,923
Yeah, tan Ford.

80
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,966
Engine running?

81
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:10,011
I don't know.
How can I tell?

82
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:13,807
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

83
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,059
Look at that pollution.

84
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:23,149
Do me a favor, will you?

85
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,194
Call this telephone number.

86
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,196
Police Department?

87
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:31,199
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

88
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:34,786
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

89
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:37,580
Got it.

90
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,084
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

91
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,129
In progress.
Yes, sir.

92
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:53,304
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

93
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,517
Shit!

94
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,532
Halt!

95
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,369
I know what you're thinking.

96
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,956
Did he fire six shots or only five?

97
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,335
To tell the truth, in the excitement
I kind of lost track myself.

98
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:50,839
This is a .44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

99
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,383
...and would blow
your head clean off...

100
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:57,887
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

101
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,764
Well, do you, punk?

102
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,747
I got to know.

103
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,725
Son of a bitch!

104
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,148
It looks like we can save that leg.

105
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,317
I've got a couple under my knee.

106
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,319
Ever consider
another line of work?

107
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,988
I really appreciate this, Steve.

108
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,699
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

109
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,576
Nothing fancy, now.

110
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:05,413
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

111
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:08,666
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

112
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:13,213
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

113
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:17,092
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

114
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,427
Sorry, Harry.

115
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,389
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

116
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,892
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

117
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,645
For $29.50, let it hurt.

118
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,439
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

119
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:56,566
- Good morning, inspector.
- Maria.

120
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:04,908
You wanted to see me, lieutenant?

121
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:11,247
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

122
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,375
Whenever you do.

123
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,712
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
checking the search patterns.

124
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:21,257
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

125
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,718
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

126
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:27,097
- He was?
- He said to say, "Well done!"

127
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,349
I can't tell you how moved I am.

128
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,643
I pass along a compliment...

129
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:35,772
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

130
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,982
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

131
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:42,529
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

132
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,740
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

133
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,492
I'm putting somebody
with you.

134
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,251
- What are you talking about?
- You need a partner.

135
00:17:56,918 --> 00:18:00,046
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

136
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,883
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

137
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:06,761
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

138
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,139
I have no time to break in newcomers.

139
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,600
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

140
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:17,063
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

141
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:18,606
...and Fanduchi's dead.

142
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:20,108
So?

143
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,904
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

144
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,364
What about De Georgio?

145
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:27,907
No way!

146
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:30,326
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

147
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,620
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

148
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,791
I got it.

149
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:43,965
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

150
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,968
You from around here?

151
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,346
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

152
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:53,058
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

153
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:56,227
Just what I need is a college boy.

154
00:18:56,478 --> 00:19:00,398
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

155
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:02,859
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

156
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,654
Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.

157
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:08,073
I intend to.

158
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,492
Inspector Callahan.

159
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:14,454
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

160
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:15,997
I'll remember that.

161
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:21,211
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

162
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,339
You're a sweet man, Harry.

163
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,930
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

164
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,349
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

165
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,393
That's one thing about our Harry.

166
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,894
Doesn't play favorites.

167
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:42,691
Harry hates everybody: limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

168
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:44,484
You name it.

169
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:48,697
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

170
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,408
Especially spics.

171
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,333
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

172
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,501
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

173
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:13,985
<i>You, on the roof!

174
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:16,029
<i>You, there!

175
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:17,989
<i>Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.

176
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:20,992
<i>Turn around
and put your hands in the air.

177
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:41,554
<i>I don't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!

178
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,808
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

179
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:48,853
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

180
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:50,730
That's possible.

181
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:01,449
- <i>Attention, all units</i>.
- Turn that thing up louder.

182
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:06,413
<i>Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.

183
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:07,789
<i>He is an adult male.

184
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,710
<i>Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.

185
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,254
<i>When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...

186
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:18,341
...<i>pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.

187
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:19,926
<i>He had a tan suitcase...

188
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:24,431
...<i>which probably contains a 30-06 rifle.
He's wanted...

189
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:28,101
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

190
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:30,228
I know what you mean.

191
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,275
- There!
- What?

192
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,193
Tan suitcase.

193
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,863
- Where?
- I lost him.

194
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,533
There he goes, over there.

195
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,118
Does that bag look tan?

196
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:47,620
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

197
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,581
Go to Filbert and hang a left.

198
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:51,416
Look out for these people!

199
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,794
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

200
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,302
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

201
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:05,764
I saw him.

202
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:07,640
- There he is.
- I see him.

203
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:12,270
<i>Car 2, the license number...

204
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,357
...<i>at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.

205
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,616
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go here.

206
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:27,786
<i>Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?

207
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:33,500
<i>Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.

208
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,377
<i>10-4.

209
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:50,600
<i>You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.

210
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:15,291
Anybody home?

211
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:42,569
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

212
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:03,006
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

213
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,055
You getting an eyeful?

214
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:12,515
You goddamn pie hawker!

215
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,143
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

216
00:27:23,818 --> 00:27:25,820
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

217
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:32,660
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

218
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:35,580
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

219
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:39,000
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

220
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:41,169
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

221
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:42,837
Beat it. Get out of here.

222
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:50,720
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

223
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,890
I just had another thought.

224
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,600
Yeah? About what?

225
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,311
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

226
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,861
<i>Inspector 71.

227
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:12,534
<i>Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.

228
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,954
<i>Inspector 71.
Do you read me?

229
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:20,083
- This is Inspector 71.
- <i>I've got an 8-0-4 in progress</i>.

230
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,003
<i>California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.

231
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,046
10-4. We're on our way.

232
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,402
It's some idiot.

233
00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:49,738
Where? I don't see him.

234
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:52,699
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

235
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:58,371
<i>I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.

236
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:01,875
<i>In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.

237
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:06,921
<i>California license D-dog,
C- Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.

238
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:19,559
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

239
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:37,410
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here...

240
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,455
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

241
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:54,779
Don't you try to get me!

242
00:30:56,072 --> 00:30:59,701
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

243
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:03,997
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

244
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:09,252
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

245
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:11,504
Won't you try to grab me?

246
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:17,635
A friend of mine was up about 20
floors with a jumper a few years ago.

247
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:20,096
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

248
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:21,389
Mashed all over.

249
00:31:21,723 --> 00:31:25,852
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which...

250
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:29,397
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

251
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:33,234
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

252
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:37,739
It's a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

253
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:40,116
Even if they find
your driver's license!

254
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:41,743
All that blood!

255
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:47,624
I think I'm going to puke!

256
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:51,544
Don't do that, son. All those people
down there looking up.

257
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:54,714
The fire chief looking up.
With his face...

258
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,591
You bastard!

259
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:46,057
Get the stretcher up here.

260
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:01,114
Now you know why I'm called
Dirty Harry.

261
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:03,783
Every dirty job that comes along.

262
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:18,631
<i>Inspector 71.

263
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:22,177
This is Inspector 71.

264
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:26,973
<i>Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

265
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:30,393
What about him?

266
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:33,396
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

267
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:37,359
Anybody know who the boy is?

268
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:39,736
His name was Charlie Russell.

269
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:41,613
I'm his mother.

270
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:45,367
He's only 10 years old.

271
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:01,883
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

272
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:04,302
You'd better go check on the mother.

273
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:17,941
What do you have?

274
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:21,236
<i>That 30-06 shell casing.

275
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:23,279
<i>He was up here all right.

276
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:29,536
Welcome to Homicide.

277
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:53,059
The man who designed blue serge
uniforms for police departments...

278
00:34:53,476 --> 00:34:55,562
...has to sell these for a living!

279
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:02,444
.458 Magnum?

280
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:07,449
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

281
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:12,370
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

282
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,790
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

283
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,667
What have you got, lieutenant?

284
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:22,297
The blue flags represent the units that
will be on duty by dark tonight.

285
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:24,799
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

286
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,844
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

287
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:32,182
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

288
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,976
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

289
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:36,895
We're saving that for him.

290
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:39,731
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

291
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:44,069
It's a building that overlooks the
roof where they spotted him yesterday.

292
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:46,321
Something bothering you?

293
00:35:47,155 --> 00:35:50,450
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

294
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:53,787
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

295
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:57,207
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

296
00:35:57,415 --> 00:36:00,960
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

297
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:05,090
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

298
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,177
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

299
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:11,930
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

300
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,516
Scorpio strikes again.

301
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:17,143
They like that feeling.

302
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:20,980
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

303
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:24,275
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

304
00:36:24,526 --> 00:36:26,653
And they're having a novena tonight.

305
00:36:26,903 --> 00:36:28,488
Go on.

306
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:32,033
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

307
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:33,910
The Russell boy was black.

308
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,914
He may just figure
he owes himself a <i>padre</i>.

309
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:55,181
Inspector 71.

310
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:58,852
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

311
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:23,960
How about the priest?

312
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:27,505
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

313
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:31,760
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

314
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,470
Who?

315
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:36,431
Never guess.

316
00:37:36,973 --> 00:37:40,101
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

317
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:14,738
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

318
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,338
Son of a bitch took the bait!

319
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:35,633
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

320
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:18,510
Now!

321
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,344
- You all right?
- I think so.

322
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:57,734
Call an ambulance.

323
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:01,029
Collins never knew what hit him.

324
00:42:05,575 --> 00:42:08,662
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

325
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,164
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

326
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:00,463
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

327
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:03,883
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

328
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:06,720
Ann Mary Deacon.

329
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,598
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

330
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:15,478
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

331
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:17,522
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive."

332
00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:21,192
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

333
00:43:22,193 --> 00:43:25,321
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

334
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:29,284
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

335
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:31,328
One man with yellow bag.

336
00:43:31,578 --> 00:43:34,414
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

337
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:36,082
9 p.m.

338
00:43:36,374 --> 00:43:38,501
She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. tomorrow.

339
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:41,379
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

340
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:45,425
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

341
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:48,261
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio."

342
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:51,806
Anything else?

343
00:43:53,558 --> 00:43:55,894
The mother identified the bra...

344
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:57,771
...the hank of hair...

345
00:43:58,146 --> 00:43:59,314
...and that.

346
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:01,191
The dentist identified that.

347
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:05,612
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

348
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:08,823
You know she's dead.

349
00:44:09,074 --> 00:44:13,453
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

350
00:44:14,663 --> 00:44:18,208
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

351
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:20,669
He's using up a lot of favors.

352
00:44:22,837 --> 00:44:24,422
He wants to pay.

353
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:27,676
No tricks.

354
00:44:33,765 --> 00:44:35,725
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

355
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:38,853
You got it.

356
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:42,190
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- All right.

357
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,068
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

358
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:47,070
No cover?
Not even one man?

359
00:44:49,406 --> 00:44:50,824
Sure that's how to do it?

360
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:53,994
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

361
00:44:56,037 --> 00:45:00,375
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

362
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,420
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

363
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:07,382
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

364
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,510
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

365
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:24,065
Testing 1, 2, 3...

366
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:27,694
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

367
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:30,905
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow."

368
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:32,741
Okay, that's better.

369
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:35,910
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

370
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:37,537
...forget it.

371
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:39,956
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?

372
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:42,375
Bring it back in one piece.

373
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:48,298
$200,000.

374
00:45:48,548 --> 00:45:50,550
Count it and sign for it.

375
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:55,096
Did you count it out?

376
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,434
Did you count it, chief?

377
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:03,438
It's not my responsibility.

378
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:09,110
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

379
00:46:11,696 --> 00:46:15,158
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

380
00:46:18,286 --> 00:46:22,248
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

381
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:24,876
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

382
00:46:25,168 --> 00:46:28,254
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

383
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:39,599
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

384
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:43,144
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

385
00:46:46,022 --> 00:46:48,900
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

386
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:03,415
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

387
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:11,775
- <i>You got a yellow suitcase?</i>
- Yeah, I got it right with me.

388
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:17,364
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- Callahan.

389
00:48:17,614 --> 00:48:20,241
- <i>What are you?</i>
- Police officer.

390
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:23,203
Hello?

391
00:48:33,922 --> 00:48:35,924
<i>All right, police officer...

392
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:38,009
...<i>this is how we play.

393
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:42,430
<i>I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.

394
00:48:42,972 --> 00:48:46,059
<i>If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.

395
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:50,438
<i>If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...

396
00:48:50,772 --> 00:48:52,190
...<i>the girl dies.

397
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,527
- Is the girl okay?
- <i>Just shut up and listen</i>.

398
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:57,112
<i>No car.

399
00:48:57,612 --> 00:49:01,282
<i>I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.

400
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:05,120
<i>I ring 4 times.
You don't answer by the fourth ring...

401
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,372
...<i>that's the end of the game.

402
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:09,416
<i>The girl dies.

403
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:11,543
<i>What time you got?

404
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:15,839
- 9:30. Now listen...
- <i>You listen</i>.

405
00:49:16,548 --> 00:49:18,133
<i>I'm watching you.

406
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:22,387
<i>Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.

407
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:27,851
<i>Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?

408
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,651
- Yeah.
- <i>I hope you're not stupid</i>.

409
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:19,569
<i>Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.

410
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:23,573
<i>Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.

411
00:52:29,366 --> 00:52:31,242
<i>You sound like you had a good rest.

412
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:35,288
<i>You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.

413
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:38,917
<i>You better make it,
because if you don't, dead girl!

414
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:42,379
<i>Public phone, hamburger stand,
Aquatic Park.

415
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:47,717
<i>Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.

416
00:53:21,418 --> 00:53:23,253
What's in the bag, man?

417
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:27,716
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

418
00:53:27,966 --> 00:53:29,342
Just give us the wallet.

419
00:53:33,013 --> 00:53:34,848
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

420
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:04,669
Don't answer that!

421
00:54:13,803 --> 00:54:18,266
- <i>Who picked it up?</i>
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.

422
00:54:22,937 --> 00:54:24,814
<i>Chico, he hung up.

423
00:54:27,317 --> 00:54:29,611
- <i>You know Mt. Davidson Park?</i>
- Yeah.

424
00:54:29,861 --> 00:54:31,112
<i>Go to the cross.

425
00:55:10,235 --> 00:55:12,529
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

426
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,573
<i>I'm going up.

427
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:32,007
I see a couple of people.

428
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:37,220
Just a couple of kids necking.

429
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,889
Boys or girls?

430
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,660
I'm Callahan.

431
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:04,706
My friends call me Alice.

432
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,750
And I will take a dare.

433
00:56:08,043 --> 00:56:10,920
When was the last time
you were busted?

434
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:14,507
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

435
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,384
Well, do it at home.

436
00:57:20,031 --> 00:57:21,116
Freeze!

437
00:57:22,158 --> 00:57:23,994
Just like a statue.

438
00:57:24,953 --> 00:57:26,454
That's right.

439
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:30,125
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

440
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:33,044
I'll kill you and the girl both.

441
00:57:33,712 --> 00:57:35,088
Understand?

442
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:37,799
Yeah.

443
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:40,677
Drop the bag.

444
00:57:44,305 --> 00:57:45,640
Left hand.

445
00:57:46,182 --> 00:57:47,809
Let's see the gun.

446
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:54,566
My!

447
00:57:55,025 --> 00:57:56,693
That's a big one.

448
00:57:58,194 --> 00:58:00,155
Left hand. Throw it.

449
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:02,699
Easy.

450
00:58:07,078 --> 00:58:08,413
Raise your hands.

451
00:58:08,663 --> 00:58:10,415
Come on, get them up.

452
00:58:14,252 --> 00:58:15,462
Now turn.

453
00:58:15,712 --> 00:58:17,505
Face the cross.

454
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:21,217
Come on.

455
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:24,262
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

456
00:58:46,201 --> 00:58:50,372
You lift that hand once more and I
won't let you know where the girl is!

457
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:52,624
Do we understand each other?

458
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:54,918
Do we understand each other?

459
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:58,338
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

460
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:00,215
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

461
00:59:00,465 --> 00:59:02,634
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

462
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,221
Do we understand each other?

463
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:11,643
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

464
00:59:11,893 --> 00:59:13,103
Listen to me carefully.

465
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:15,897
I've changed my mind.

466
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:18,149
I'm going to let her die.

467
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,362
I just wanted you to know that.

468
00:59:26,741 --> 00:59:31,329
<i>You understand? I just wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.

469
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:42,257
Goodbye, Callahan!

470
00:59:51,683 --> 00:59:53,476
Chico, don't kill him!

471
01:01:48,508 --> 01:01:51,886
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, chief.

472
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:54,514
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

473
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:56,391
He's right here.

474
01:01:56,641 --> 01:01:58,226
He's got two cracked ribs.

475
01:01:58,476 --> 01:02:01,271
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

476
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:04,691
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

477
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:06,192
I'm sending him home.

478
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:07,777
Right, chief.

479
01:02:08,903 --> 01:02:10,655
He says beat it! That's an order.

480
01:02:12,824 --> 01:02:16,369
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

481
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:20,248
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

482
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:22,667
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

483
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:25,545
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

484
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:27,505
What am I going to tell him?

485
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,385
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

486
01:02:33,011 --> 01:02:36,222
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

487
01:02:36,431 --> 01:02:39,100
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

488
01:02:39,351 --> 01:02:42,812
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

489
01:02:44,856 --> 01:02:47,567
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

490
01:02:54,658 --> 01:02:56,743
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

491
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:01,665
- Put him on.
- What is it?

492
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:07,545
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

493
01:03:09,297 --> 01:03:12,300
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

494
01:03:12,842 --> 01:03:14,678
Long blond hair...

495
01:03:14,928 --> 01:03:17,889
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

496
01:03:18,515 --> 01:03:19,724
Pale complexion.

497
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:23,561
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

498
01:03:24,688 --> 01:03:26,398
They usually give a phony name.

499
01:03:27,857 --> 01:03:29,859
But I've seen him someplace.

500
01:03:30,402 --> 01:03:34,531
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

501
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:36,783
I'm trying to think!

502
01:03:37,033 --> 01:03:38,410
It was...

503
01:03:39,202 --> 01:03:40,912
I believe he works around here.

504
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:44,207
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

505
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:46,126
Yes, just a moment.

506
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,840
She'll be dead in an hour!

507
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,134
I'm trying to remember!

508
01:03:56,511 --> 01:03:58,430
I've got who he is.

509
01:03:59,264 --> 01:04:03,518
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

510
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:06,855
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

511
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:09,774
- Live where?
- There.

512
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:16,406
Kezar Stadium.

513
01:05:20,887 --> 01:05:23,014
Illegal entry. No warrant.

514
01:05:23,348 --> 01:05:25,100
Looks like we climb.

515
01:05:26,476 --> 01:05:27,977
Too much linguine.

516
01:05:30,188 --> 01:05:31,898
I'll find another way.

517
01:08:49,012 --> 01:08:50,055
Stop!

518
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:13,203
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

519
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:15,747
You need any help?

520
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:21,336
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

521
01:09:21,753 --> 01:09:25,298
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

522
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,009
Let me have a doctor!

523
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:30,804
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

524
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:32,931
The girl, where is she?

525
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:34,349
You tried to kill me!

526
01:09:34,599 --> 01:09:38,770
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

527
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,188
I want a lawyer.

528
01:09:40,397 --> 01:09:42,315
I said, where's the girl?

529
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:45,819
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

530
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:49,322
I have the right to a lawyer!

531
01:09:50,281 --> 01:09:51,741
Don't! Please!

532
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:54,536
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

533
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:35,387
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

534
01:11:35,637 --> 01:11:39,641
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

535
01:11:39,933 --> 01:11:43,144
- It's Inspector Callahan.
- <i>Have him come in, please</i>.

536
01:11:44,187 --> 01:11:46,398
Won't you come this way?

537
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:50,235
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

538
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,704
I'll be done in a minute.

539
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:02,831
Have a seat.

540
01:12:07,252 --> 01:12:10,755
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

541
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,719
A very unusual piece of police work.

542
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,763
Really amazing.

543
01:12:20,015 --> 01:12:21,266
I had some luck.

544
01:12:21,516 --> 01:12:25,312
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

545
01:12:29,024 --> 01:12:33,069
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

546
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,282
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

547
01:12:38,033 --> 01:12:40,744
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

548
01:12:42,537 --> 01:12:45,457
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

549
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:49,753
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

550
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:54,007
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

551
01:12:54,215 --> 01:12:56,551
You should be.
I've got news for you.

552
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,471
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

553
01:13:00,805 --> 01:13:02,307
What are you talking about?

554
01:13:02,557 --> 01:13:03,725
He's free!

555
01:13:04,559 --> 01:13:05,935
You're letting him go?

556
01:13:06,186 --> 01:13:07,979
We have to.
We can't try him.

557
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:09,481
And why is that?

558
01:13:09,731 --> 01:13:12,734
Because I'm not wasting
1/2 million tax dollars...

559
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:15,236
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

560
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:18,239
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

561
01:13:18,573 --> 01:13:21,368
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

562
01:13:21,826 --> 01:13:23,036
Zero.

563
01:13:24,454 --> 01:13:28,249
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

564
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,503
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

565
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,798
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

566
01:13:35,882 --> 01:13:38,468
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?

567
01:13:38,718 --> 01:13:39,886
It's the law.

568
01:13:40,637 --> 01:13:42,097
Then the law is crazy!

569
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:46,101
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

570
01:13:46,309 --> 01:13:51,189
He holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

571
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:52,524
Your Honor?

572
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:58,655
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

573
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:03,076
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

574
01:14:03,284 --> 01:14:05,203
...is inadmissible in court.

575
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:09,416
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

576
01:14:09,624 --> 01:14:12,919
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

577
01:14:13,128 --> 01:14:16,214
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

578
01:14:16,464 --> 01:14:17,632
But I didn't know that!

579
01:14:18,216 --> 01:14:23,054
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

580
01:14:23,346 --> 01:14:27,517
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

581
01:14:28,226 --> 01:14:31,813
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

582
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,315
...physical evidence...

583
01:14:33,523 --> 01:14:35,859
...would have to be excluded.

584
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,825
There must be something
you can get him on!

585
01:14:44,034 --> 01:14:47,037
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

586
01:14:47,829 --> 01:14:50,582
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

587
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:54,711
Now, the suspect's rights...

588
01:14:54,961 --> 01:14:56,755
...were violated...

589
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:59,174
...under the 4th and 5th...

590
01:14:59,424 --> 01:15:02,218
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

591
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:05,013
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

592
01:15:05,263 --> 01:15:08,350
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

593
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,143
The district attorney's office!

594
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:12,854
If you'll let us.

595
01:15:14,522 --> 01:15:18,610
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

596
01:15:18,943 --> 01:15:20,695
He won't be out there long.

597
01:15:20,945 --> 01:15:23,114
What is that supposed to mean?

598
01:15:23,573 --> 01:15:26,576
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

599
01:15:26,785 --> 01:15:29,496
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

600
01:15:30,163 --> 01:15:34,417
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

601
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:36,294
How do you know?

602
01:15:37,587 --> 01:15:39,339
Because he likes it.

603
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:08,613
You sure you weren't tailed?

604
01:18:09,155 --> 01:18:10,365
Yeah.

605
01:18:35,056 --> 01:18:37,309
You really want $200 worth.

606
01:18:38,393 --> 01:18:40,312
Every penny of it.

607
01:18:54,617 --> 01:18:56,077
Might as well be comfortable.

608
01:18:56,786 --> 01:18:58,413
Go on, sit.

609
01:19:06,129 --> 01:19:07,630
Relax.

610
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,800
Take it easy.

611
01:19:11,176 --> 01:19:13,511
It's going to be all right.

612
01:19:54,844 --> 01:19:57,097
You sure you want the rest of it?

613
01:19:57,847 --> 01:19:59,599
Every penny's worth!

614
01:20:01,142 --> 01:20:04,604
You black son of a bitch!

615
01:20:26,292 --> 01:20:28,753
This one's on the house.

616
01:20:43,351 --> 01:20:44,936
That's got to be him.

617
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:51,651
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

618
01:20:51,901 --> 01:20:53,820
I swear it. As God is my judge.

619
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,197
Why are they harassing you?

620
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:58,450
They tried to frame me with the murder.

621
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:01,578
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

622
01:21:01,828 --> 01:21:05,999
I'm innocent until proven guilty
and look at what they did to me.

623
01:21:06,291 --> 01:21:09,461
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

624
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:13,006
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

625
01:21:13,214 --> 01:21:15,258
Did you see who did this to you?

626
01:21:15,508 --> 01:21:16,676
Can you identify him?

627
01:21:16,968 --> 01:21:21,556
<i>His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.

628
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:27,145
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

629
01:21:27,395 --> 01:21:30,357
Since then he's given
a statement to <i>The Chronicle</i>.

630
01:21:30,857 --> 01:21:34,152
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

631
01:21:35,111 --> 01:21:36,905
What about it, Harry?

632
01:21:37,822 --> 01:21:40,325
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

633
01:21:40,575 --> 01:21:42,327
Have you been following him?

634
01:21:43,953 --> 01:21:47,457
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

635
01:21:47,874 --> 01:21:50,126
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

636
01:21:50,669 --> 01:21:53,588
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

637
01:21:54,381 --> 01:21:57,050
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

638
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:00,011
I don't want any more surveillance!

639
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,722
Neither does he.

640
01:22:04,683 --> 01:22:05,767
What does that mean?

641
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,187
Good night, sir.

642
01:22:13,066 --> 01:22:14,818
Go ahead. Try them.

643
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,947
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

644
01:22:19,197 --> 01:22:21,866
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

645
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:25,537
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

646
01:22:26,204 --> 01:22:29,290
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

647
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,588
Doing a lot of thinking
about it and...

648
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,885
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

649
01:22:41,594 --> 01:22:43,596
...what for? You know?

650
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:49,894
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

651
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,069
See you tomorrow. Same time?

652
01:23:20,925 --> 01:23:23,678
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

653
01:23:24,304 --> 01:23:26,681
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

654
01:23:26,931 --> 01:23:28,433
No class.

655
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:31,394
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

656
01:23:31,645 --> 01:23:33,521
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

657
01:23:34,105 --> 01:23:37,776
What I meant was,
whatever it takes to be a cop's wife...

658
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:40,070
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

659
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,864
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

660
01:23:43,114 --> 01:23:45,450
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

661
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:50,455
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

662
01:23:50,705 --> 01:23:51,956
And I think...

663
01:23:53,124 --> 01:23:55,585
...what if it's the last time
I see him?

664
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,338
Am I the only one?

665
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:00,590
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

666
01:24:00,882 --> 01:24:02,008
No.

667
01:24:03,134 --> 01:24:05,303
You mean she got used to it?

668
01:24:05,804 --> 01:24:07,597
No, she never did, really.

669
01:24:07,847 --> 01:24:09,140
What, then?

670
01:24:09,849 --> 01:24:11,393
She's dead.

671
01:24:12,143 --> 01:24:13,895
Please, forgive me.

672
01:24:14,562 --> 01:24:17,774
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

673
01:24:18,024 --> 01:24:19,484
No reason for it, really.

674
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,612
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

675
01:24:23,363 --> 01:24:25,031
I want you to tell Chico...

676
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:28,118
...that I understand him quitting.

677
01:24:28,368 --> 01:24:31,538
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

678
01:24:32,163 --> 01:24:35,333
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

679
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,378
I really don't.

680
01:25:15,665 --> 01:25:17,917
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

681
01:25:19,377 --> 01:25:21,296
What the hell happened to you?

682
01:25:21,546 --> 01:25:23,506
My wife's brother.

683
01:25:23,757 --> 01:25:24,883
I hit her...

684
01:25:25,133 --> 01:25:26,801
...so he hit me.

685
01:25:27,052 --> 01:25:28,553
Several times.

686
01:25:30,096 --> 01:25:31,556
$5.69.

687
01:25:33,558 --> 01:25:36,645
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

688
01:25:36,895 --> 01:25:39,356
14 times the last 3 years.

689
01:25:39,606 --> 01:25:42,609
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.

690
01:25:42,859 --> 01:25:45,445
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

691
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:50,408
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

692
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:53,119
Please, I scare easy.

693
01:25:56,373 --> 01:25:59,084
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

694
01:26:35,578 --> 01:26:36,746
Goodbye.

695
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:39,833
See you tomorrow.

696
01:26:49,759 --> 01:26:52,470
Everybody out who gets out here?

697
01:26:52,804 --> 01:26:54,389
School bus inspector.

698
01:26:54,597 --> 01:26:57,225
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

699
01:26:57,434 --> 01:26:59,060
I'm authorizing it, so go.

700
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:01,146
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

701
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:05,692
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

702
01:27:07,777 --> 01:27:11,406
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

703
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:17,704
Let's have some fun now.

704
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:19,497
Who knows a song?

705
01:27:19,664 --> 01:27:22,751
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

706
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:25,045
Come on, sing for us.

707
01:29:08,398 --> 01:29:12,319
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

708
01:29:16,614 --> 01:29:19,200
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

709
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:23,580
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

710
01:29:25,749 --> 01:29:28,543
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

711
01:29:29,085 --> 01:29:32,088
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

712
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,549
Tell them the man is dangerous.

713
01:29:34,799 --> 01:29:38,595
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

714
01:29:38,928 --> 01:29:40,347
"To the City of San Francisco.

715
01:29:40,555 --> 01:29:43,099
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

716
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:48,063
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

717
01:29:48,813 --> 01:29:52,567
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

718
01:29:52,817 --> 01:29:55,403
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

719
01:29:55,654 --> 01:29:58,031
...exactly what I say. Scorpio."

720
01:30:00,992 --> 01:30:03,078
Better have somebody standing by!

721
01:30:03,328 --> 01:30:05,246
I don't think it's a false alarm.

722
01:30:05,455 --> 01:30:07,707
<i>There's a call for you on line 2.

723
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,377
<i>I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.

724
01:30:17,008 --> 01:30:19,886
- It's the Mayor.
- <i>I got 7 kids from Park Street School</i>.

725
01:30:22,389 --> 01:30:23,598
I got the bus and...

726
01:30:23,848 --> 01:30:27,352
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

727
01:30:27,602 --> 01:30:29,437
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

728
01:30:29,813 --> 01:30:31,231
Just tell him.

729
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:33,149
Not my fault, he had a gun...

730
01:30:33,358 --> 01:30:34,275
Just your name!

731
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:39,781
<i>This is Marcella Platt.

732
01:30:41,658 --> 01:30:44,202
<i>You can check if you want.
But I don't see any point.

733
01:30:44,452 --> 01:30:45,996
<i>I'm not bullshitting.

734
01:30:46,204 --> 01:30:49,332
<i>It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...

735
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:51,126
...<i>the kids start dying.

736
01:30:51,334 --> 01:30:54,963
- The plane ready?
- <i>It's being fueled, and ready to go</i>.

737
01:30:55,171 --> 01:30:57,966
<i>The money will be there
by the time you get there.

738
01:30:58,174 --> 01:31:01,344
<i>Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.

739
01:31:01,594 --> 01:31:03,555
<i>Just me and a busload of kids.

740
01:31:03,888 --> 01:31:07,100
<i>I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.

741
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,185
<i>I don't want any police cars...

742
01:31:09,394 --> 01:31:10,562
...<i>helicopters, whatever.

743
01:31:10,937 --> 01:31:15,025
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

744
01:31:15,233 --> 01:31:17,027
Where are you going?

745
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:20,822
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

746
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:25,910
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

747
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:27,746
I give you my word of honor.

748
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,999
Marcella Platt. It checks.

749
01:31:35,295 --> 01:31:37,464
Willing to take the money to him?

750
01:31:37,756 --> 01:31:42,010
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

751
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:45,305
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

752
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:48,892
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

753
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,769
And that's a direct order!

754
01:31:52,812 --> 01:31:56,191
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

755
01:33:29,909 --> 01:33:31,745
Where are we going?

756
01:33:32,746 --> 01:33:36,458
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

757
01:33:36,666 --> 01:33:38,585
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

758
01:33:38,793 --> 01:33:41,421
I want to go home to my mother.

759
01:33:41,671 --> 01:33:42,839
Go home to your what?

760
01:33:43,757 --> 01:33:45,467
Now, sing! Sing again!

761
01:33:47,552 --> 01:33:49,346
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

762
01:33:51,139 --> 01:33:53,266
Are you sick?
What is it?

763
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,686
Sing or your mothers will die!

764
01:33:56,936 --> 01:33:59,648
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

765
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:08,907
Get in the right-hand lane.

766
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:11,534
Not right to treat children that way.

767
01:34:11,785 --> 01:34:14,245
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

768
01:34:14,496 --> 01:34:16,581
And get in the right-hand lane!

769
01:34:23,463 --> 01:34:25,590
I want my mother.

770
01:34:33,932 --> 01:34:35,600
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

771
01:34:35,809 --> 01:34:36,893
Make a right there.

772
01:34:37,727 --> 01:34:40,981
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

773
01:34:41,648 --> 01:34:43,525
Not this one.

774
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:45,527
I want my mother.

775
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:47,862
Shut up!

776
01:34:49,906 --> 01:34:51,491
Just get to the right!

777
01:35:06,423 --> 01:35:08,008
Jesus!

778
01:35:16,099 --> 01:35:18,685
What the hell is he doing up there?

779
01:35:23,315 --> 01:35:26,401
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

780
01:38:45,892 --> 01:38:47,477
Drop the gun, creep!

781
01:38:50,313 --> 01:38:52,399
I'll blow his brains out.

782
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,570
Drop the fucking gun!

783
01:39:45,035 --> 01:39:46,745
I know what you're thinking.

784
01:39:47,996 --> 01:39:51,499
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

785
01:39:52,459 --> 01:39:55,795
To tell you the truth, I forgot
myself, in all this excitement.

786
01:39:56,796 --> 01:40:00,550
But being this is a .44 Magnum, the
most powerful handgun in the world...

787
01:40:00,759 --> 01:40:03,470
...and will blow your head
clean off...

788
01:40:03,762 --> 01:40:05,680
...you've got to ask yourself:

789
01:40:07,057 --> 01:40:08,767
"Do I feel lucky?"

790
01:40:14,731 --> 01:40:16,900
Well, do you, punk?
