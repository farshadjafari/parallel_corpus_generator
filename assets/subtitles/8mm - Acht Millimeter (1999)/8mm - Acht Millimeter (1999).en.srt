2
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,001
Welcome to Miami.
While in the airport, please
observe Florida laws...

3
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:29,654
... which prohibit smoking in the terminal.
Thank you for not smoking.

4
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:51,367
Your son-in-law dealt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.

5
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:54,238
He saw that woman every night.

6
00:02:55,933 --> 00:03:00,674
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.

7
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,152
It's unpIeasant, I know.

8
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,109
Discreet, isn't he?

9
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,415
What an imbeciIe!

10
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:11,807
I tried to warn my daughter,
but what can you do?

11
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,807
I worry about the chiIdren.

12
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,416
My invoice is in the enveIope,
if that's aII.

13
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,373
Yes, Mr. WeIIes. Thank you.

14
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:25,549
- Senator, Iet me know if I can be
of further assistance to you.
- I'II be in touch.

15
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:07,339
- Hello?
- You're home.

16
00:04:07,992 --> 00:04:10,210
We're back here.

17
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:14,210
- How did it go?
- I think very weII.

18
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,603
Daddy's home, sweetie.

19
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,647
How's the textbook business?

20
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:25,387
I got 10,000 words on
the FederaI Theatre project.

21
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,649
It shouId be 4000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

22
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:34,214
- How was Miami?
- Fine. Lonesome.

23
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:38,564
- CouIdn't pay me enough to Iive down there.
- Then why'd you go?

24
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:42,173
Senator Michaelson
has powerful friends.

25
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:49,740
HeIIo, CindereIIa.

26
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:54,307
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

27
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,785
Oh, that's my girI.
She missed you.
I missed you.

28
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:00,961
You been smoking?

29
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:04,003
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

30
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:08,006
Come on, honey.

31
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,571
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars foIIowing this guy.
Is this the first thing I get?

32
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,616
-You're accusing me?
-I'm not accusing you.

33
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,095
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been aII through that.

34
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:25,009
- I'II make dinner. Are you hungry?
- You're cooking?

35
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,532
- I missed you.
- I love you.

36
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:39,968
I don't Iike it when you Ieave.

37
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,014
ShouId I go?

38
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,405
I'm going to do it.

39
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:00,930
Come on.

40
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,887
What's aII the troubIe, CindereIIa?

41
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,322
There, there.

42
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,890
I love you.

43
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,021
I love you.

44
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,111
Honey, phone!

45
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,461
Okay, I've got it!

46
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:50,201
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

47
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:58,855
It's a pIeasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. LongdaIe.
How can I be of assistance to you?

48
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,727
Four o'cIock wouId be fine.

49
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,076
I think I know where it is.

50
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,858
Goodbye.

51
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:56,867
DanieI LongdaIe.
We spoke on the phone.

52
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:01,869
I'm the Christians' attorney and
an executor of the estate.
This is Mrs. Christian.

53
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,565
- An honour to meet you.
- You come highIy
recommended, Mr. WeIIes.

54
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:10,739
I've spoken to associates of mine in
Harrisburg, Lancaster and Hershey.

55
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,523
- You have infIuentiaI friends.
- I've been priviIeged to provide
services for peopIe I admire.

56
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,524
You were praised for your discretion...

57
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:22,786
...your strict adherence
to confidentiaIity.

58
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:31,657
- As you know, my husband passed away recentIy.
- My condoIences, Mrs. Christian.

59
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:37,397
His passing has Ieft me
with something of a diIemma.

60
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:40,572
I'II do whatever I can to heIp.

61
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:45,835
- My husband's inner sanctum.
- Not many peopIe have been inside this room.

62
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,445
- My father worked the Pittsburgh miII.
- Irving United SteeI, I beIieve.

63
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:56,446
But you attended Penn
on an academic schoIarship.

64
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:01,402
- Peers went into Iaw and finance.
You chose surveiIIance.
- I decided it was the future.

65
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,751
- Your husband is a Iegend.
- Please.

66
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:08,578
We were married for 45 years. Four children ...

67
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,144
... Seven grandchildren.

68
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,667
But his true passion lay...
...in his work.

69
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,798
But he was always loyal.
I Ioved him deepIy.

70
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,798
I understand.

71
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,104
DanieI.

72
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,800
My husband was the onIy one
with the combination to this safe.

73
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:32,540
We hired somebody to open it.

74
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:36,541
I have not let anyone see the contents.

75
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:39,846
I feIt these were
my husband's private things.

76
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:42,108
I didn't....

77
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:45,195
I didn't reaIize....

78
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,370
Do you want to teII me
what you found?

79
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:54,370
Cash, stock certificates ...

80
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:57,459
Nothing out of the ordinary,
reaIIy, except that.

81
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,851
It's a fiIm...

82
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:06,809
- ...where a girI appears to be murdered.
- I'm not sure I understand.

83
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,461
It is very realistic.

84
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:14,201
But how many peopIe seem to be reaIisticaIIy kiIIed...
...in movies and on TV every day?

85
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:18,464
It begins as a reIativeIy
sIeazy bit of pornography...

86
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:22,160
...and rapidIy turns
quite vioIent and bIoody.

87
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,900
What you're taIking about
is caIIed a snuff fiIm.

88
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:34,553
Snuff fiIms are a kind of urban myth.
Sex industry foIkIore.

89
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,075
- There's no such thing.
- That's what I expIained to Mrs. Christian.

90
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,294
This is probabIy an S & M fiIm of some sort.
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

91
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:47,338
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.
Fake bIood, speciaI effects.

92
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:51,382
WouId you look at the fiIm
and give us your opinion?

93
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,775
AII I want...

94
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:56,820
...is to know that
this atrocity is faIse.

95
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,472
I want the proof.

96
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:59,846
WeII......whoever made the fiIm
was adept at authenticity.
But I'm no expert.

97
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:03,890
- Let the poIice make a determination.
- Out of the question.

98
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:07,195
That'd be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...

99
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:10,414
...not the least of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

100
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:15,936
Find out who made this fiIm...
...and estabIish whether it's reaI.

101
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:21,676
You can name your price., You'II be provided with
whatever you need to buy information.

102
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:29,286
GirI's aII I've got to go on.
I couId treat it Iike a missing persons case.

103
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,461
...we need to be assured
that you wouId not copy this fiIm.

104
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,766
You have my word on that.

105
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:42,029
But I'II be deaIing directIy with you......and onIy you.
Your reIationship with your attorney is your own.

106
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,551
-No offense.
-None taken.

107
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:48,464
I reaIize you've given this carefuI consideration.

108
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:53,552
- You couId have destroyed it.
- TeII me the poor girI wasn't kiIIed.

109
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:57,422
PIease?...Find her aIive.

110
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,381
I'II do the best I can, ma'am.

111
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,607
- Cleveland? You just got home.
- I wish I couId stay,

112
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:47,868
but this is the mortgage.
It's Cindy's coIIege money.

113
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,869
If I do right by her,
with the circIe she runs in...
...this couId be a big break.

114
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:55,827
- Do we need a break?
- Your father thinks we do.

115
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,829
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

116
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,307
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feeI sorry for her.

117
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:09,570
It's a missing persons.
I toId her I'd give it
a coupIe of weeks. Three.

118
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,440
It can't take Ionger than that.
It's an outside shot.

119
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,092
That's aII I can teII you.

120
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,180
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.

121
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,615
It's aIways that way.

122
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:24,833
-She's awake. I'II get her.
-I'II be up in a sec.

123
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:55,970
-You're taking the gun?
-I won't need it.

124
00:15:56,188 --> 00:16:00,014
- Don't take it.
- I won't wear it. It's a precaution. Don't worry.

125
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:02,450
WiII you caII me
when you get there, pIease?

126
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:22,889
I've been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

127
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:26,411
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...

128
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,194
...a runaway, about 18, maybe.
They buy her a meal.

129
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:35,152
The doctor tries to convince her...
... that, at least, she should call home.

130
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,718
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself......that was the last they saw of her.

131
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:45,327
We had a friend of mine
at the department work up a sketch.
They want to see if I can I.D. this girI...

132
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:50,111
...then pass aIong a message to the parents...
...letting them know the kid's aIive.

133
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,678
- You don't mind if I run a check?
- Go ahead.

134
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,288
You want it, you got it.
Knock yourseIf out.

135
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:01,897
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1 ,000,000
missing every year.

136
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:05,333
We got as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

137
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:09,290
Files are by state and year of disappearance.
Children are separate.

138
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:14,291
No eating or smoking.
-There's coffee.
-Any good?

139
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:19,118
It'll be your best friend
after a few days...... if you last that long.
Good luck!

140
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,945
Honey, it's me.

141
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,380
- How are you?
- I'm good.

142
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:30,339
- Where are you?
- I'm still in Cleveland.

143
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:34,686
- How's Cindy?
- SShe's sweet. She's sleeping.

144
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,514
-I'm missing you bigtime.
-Yeah, I miss you too.

145
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:44,818
- I'll call you tomorrow night. Good night.
- Good night, sweetheart.

146
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:33,047
Hello, Mrs. Christian? Tom Welles.
Here's where we stand.

147
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:36,787
I checked the film stock.
It's called Supralux 5-4-4.

148
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:40,397
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

149
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:43,962
- So the fiIm was made prior to that?
- Yes.

150
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,529
I'm probabIy being
overIy thorough with this...

151
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,529
...but you might dig up your husband's
financiaI records......about 6 or 7 years ago.

152
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:54,225
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

153
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:58,096
This isn't a movie you drop off
at the one-hour photo.

154
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,879
- So you think it's one of a kind.
- The film is what we've got.
There's no negative.

155
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:07,315
Unlike video, it's not
designed to be duplicated.

156
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:12,838
Whatever this is, I have a feeling...
... there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

157
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:16,752
I'm looking for a girl
we're not even sure is missing.

158
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,623
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

159
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,145
... finding the guys who made this film
is going to be very difficult.

160
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,538
I know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

161
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:30,843
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

162
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,886
I will. I'll keep trying for you.

163
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:36,234
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

164
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:41,670
We can't come to the phone now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

165
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:47,585
Honey, it's me. I'm sorry I forgot
to caII Iast night....I won't forget tonight.

166
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:51,020
I've been gone a long time.
I hope I'II be home soon.

167
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:54,021
I Iove you, and I miss you.
We'II taIk tonight.

168
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,594
Mary Anne Mathews
AGE: 16

169
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:35,639
MISSING SINCE 1993

170
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:16,212
Hello!

171
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,865
Looking for Janet?

172
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:29,868
HeIIo, Mrs. Mathews?
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a Iicensed investigator.

173
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:35,304
I've been hired by the U.S. Resource
Centre, Missing Persons.....as part of an internaI audit.

174
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:40,957
I'd Iike you to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

175
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:45,218
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent....

176
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:48,133
- NeiI. NeiI Cole?
- Yes, Agent Cole.

177
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:53,872
- He toId me he'd call and let you know to expect me.
- He didn't caII?

178
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:03,136
- Is this you?
- Yes.

179
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,701
- You Iook about five years oId.
- A little older.

180
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,789
Sweet.

181
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:16,661
It's important that you don't
let this raise your expectations.

182
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:20,661
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

183
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:25,792
All I'm saying is, pIease know...
...I'm not here to create any false hope.

184
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:34,272
We fought aII the time, Mary Anne and me...
...and her stepdad.

185
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:39,013
She hated him...
...because he was not her real dad.

186
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:42,187
TroubIe here, troubIe at school ...

187
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,839
TroubIe.

188
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:47,710
Didn't Iike ruIes.
Takes after me, I guess.

189
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,754
I had to learn the hard way.

190
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:54,843
Can I speak to your husband?

191
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,233
Her stepfather? Dave? Gone.

192
00:22:57,974 --> 00:23:00,626
Two years after Mary Anne left.

193
00:23:00,844 --> 00:23:03,844
All the time, she resented him.

194
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:08,193
I Iost her because of him,
and then I Iost him.

195
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:11,064
I'm the onIy one still here.

196
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:16,891
- Did Mary have a boyfriend?
- She was sneaking out with someone.

197
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:19,326
She wouIdn't teII me who.

198
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:22,892
Coming home with hickeys,
lying aII the time.

199
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:27,806
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...

200
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:32,199
...with the stepfather....
...were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

201
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,372
There was nothing Iike that.

202
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:39,548
The poIice and FBI asked.
There wasn't anything Iike that. She'd have toId me.

203
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:42,896
I apoIogize. I had to ask.

204
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:48,376
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

205
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,810
They'II be waiting for her when she comes back.

206
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,986
It's because I slapped her.
I know.

207
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,814
We were fighting about Dave ...

208
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:06,640
and she was just pushing my buttons.
And I slapped her.

209
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:11,598
Jesus!
Next day, she was gone.

210
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,990
When kids run, they aImost always leave a note.

211
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,687
- It's guiIt, usually.
- There wasn't one.PoIice looked.

212
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:26,514
An abduction's one thing, a runaway's another.
Sometimes it's not the priority for the poIice it shouId be.

213
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:31,472
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

214
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:34,125
You're probably right,
but would you let me look?

215
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:39,430
You teII me......not to get my hopes up...

216
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:43,561
...not to raise my expectations.

217
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:50,824
Go ahead. I need a drink.

218
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,955
Thank you.

219
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:47,153
Dear Mom,
if you're reading this.... it means I called you
from Hollywood, California.

220
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:53,198
I left my diary behind because
I want you to see why I'm leaving.
It's not because you hit me.

221
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:56,589
I hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

222
00:26:56,763 --> 00:27:01,547
Warren Anderson and me are in love.
I'm going to start a new life with him.

223
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:06,635
His dad owns that garage in town.
But Warren has even bigger plans.

224
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,114
He'll become a star in action movies.

225
00:27:09,332 --> 00:27:13,462
He says I'm prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.
I could be a star too.

226
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,899
You want a drink?

227
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:21,942
When we cruise into Hollywood...
...I'll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because I am in love.

228
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,727
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

229
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:32,250
- Fixed you a drink.
- Thanks, no. I've got work to do.

230
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:35,119
I'II stop by tomorrow night.

231
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,946
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

232
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:41,686
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

233
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,644
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TV or in magazines.

234
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:48,645
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

235
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:50,906
Mr. Anderson?

236
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,907
Who's asking?

237
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:57,124
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

238
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:01,386
I'm Iooking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

239
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:03,691
Sure.

240
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,213
What's it about? You a cop?

241
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:11,301
No, sir. Just a friend from a whiIe back.
Owe him some money.

242
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,259
You owe him money? That's a new one.

243
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,999
You can Ieave it
right here if you want.

244
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:25,304
If it's aII the same,
I'd Iike to send it to him.
CaIifornia, right?

245
00:28:27,175 --> 00:28:29,218
California?

246
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:33,524
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville lockup is?

247
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:38,132
That's where Warren is.
Doing eight months on a B and E.

248
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,656
Thank you.

249
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:51,875
Yeah, man, I knew her.
Dumped that bitch right before I moved to L.A.

250
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,659
She shows up knocking at my door
lIike a fucking stalker.

251
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,442
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

252
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,965
Where'd she go?

253
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:06,139
Hell, maybe ...

254
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:09,139
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck, either.

255
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:14,097
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

256
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:16,794
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

257
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:21,098
Did you hear from her again?

258
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,796
Because I fucked her
doesn't mean I wanted her there.

259
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:29,710
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

260
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:32,449
And so did I.
Check me out now.

261
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:39,625
Why don't you pass me
one of them smokes?

262
00:29:46,714 --> 00:29:49,148
I don't smoke.

263
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,932
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

264
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,195
- You don't sound okay.
- It's not easy.

265
00:29:59,412 --> 00:30:03,716
- Why? What's going on?
- It's just tougher than
I thought it wouId be.

266
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,065
- Is it getting to you?
- I got a lead I can't drop.

267
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:11,414
- I'm aImost done. I miss you.
- I miss you too. I Iove you.

268
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:15,284
- Give Cindy a kiss for me.
- Wait, I think she wants to say bye.

269
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:19,373
- Say bye to Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.

270
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:23,547
- Hi, Cinderella.
- She's touching the phone.

271
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:26,939
You shouId see her face
at your voice.

272
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:31,071
- I love you.
- I love you. Bye.

273
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:36,029
I was just making dinner.

274
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:41,377
- I've made enough for two, as it happens.
- I'm sorry, I can't stay.

275
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:45,161
I wanted to let you know
I spoke to my people at the agency.

276
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:48,552
I toId them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

277
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:55,032
Well......stay for a drink, at least.

278
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,599
You sure you're not hungry?
It'd be nice to have a meal
without the TV on for once.

279
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:09,166
- I have a long drive ahead of me.
- It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.

280
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:12,993
I don't know why. You think
I'd be used to it by now.

281
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:26,256
Mrs. Mathews?

282
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:30,345
- Janet.
- Do you ever consider....

283
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,649
Do you realize that Mary Anne
may never come back?

284
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,171
I think about it every day.

285
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:43,260
Every time the phone rings...
...every time, I stiII think it's her.

286
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:46,957
She's all I think about.

287
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,436
Can you teII me...

288
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:54,218
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...

289
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:58,307
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...

290
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:01,612
...living a good life, being happy...

291
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,005
...but you don't know...
...you never find out...

292
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,396
...or the worst being true...

293
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:14,223
...her being gone...

294
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,833
...but you know.

295
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,050
You finaIIy know...

296
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:21,921
...what's happened to her.

297
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:25,573
What would I choose?

298
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:34,097
Yes. I would choose to know.

299
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:39,229
I need to know.

300
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:47,883
Excuse me, I have to use your restroom.

301
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:44,634
You're Ieaving.

302
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:46,373
I'II caII you if I find anything out.

303
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:51,201
I'll call you if I learn something.

304
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,410
How you doing?

305
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,410
- Big date tonight?
- Yeah, guess so.

306
00:36:40,628 --> 00:36:43,803
CouId I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?

307
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,021
It is tempting, but no thanks.

308
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:52,718
I'd hate to see you in one of those everyday situations......that caIIs for it
and you don't have one.

309
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:55,370
I'II risk it.

310
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,066
All right, your totaI
is $74.58, pIease.

311
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:04,590
A hundred.

312
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,679
TotaI's $25 and some change.

313
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:22,158
Thank you for shopping
at AduIt Bookstore. And have yourseIf a fabuIous day.

314
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:25,029
What are you reading?

315
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:31,379
Catchy titIe. What are you reaIIy reading?
Hard to beIieve it's got
any parts worth highIighting.

316
00:37:34,857 --> 00:37:36,683
Capote.

317
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:40,815
- You know how it is.
- Sure.

318
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:45,947
WouIdn't want to embarrass yourseIf
in front of your feIIow perverts.

319
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:51,339
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.
Where wouId I be then?

320
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:54,601
Have a good day.

321
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:25,520
- How are you?
- Hey, honey.

322
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,695
-How you doing?
-I'm a little beat.

323
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:30,565
- How's Cindy?
- She's sweet. She misses you.

324
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:36,392
- How's it going?
- The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

325
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:39,306
ReaIIy?

326
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,871
Honey, wait.

327
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:47,307
- Can I caII you back?
- I'll call you right back, I promise.
Bye, honey.

328
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,187
Mrs. Christian, there were three men.
Not just the cameraman and the masked man.

329
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,667
I caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

330
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,667
I'll get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

331
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:47,146
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not--

332
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:52,190
All right, I'll keep trying.
Thank you, I appreciate your support. Goodbye.

333
00:39:53,452 --> 00:39:56,670
What we have here is
1 37 billabIe man-hours...

334
00:39:56,844 --> 00:39:59,409
...a hundred-pIus thousand
doIIars machine...

335
00:39:59,627 --> 00:40:04,673
...and the resuIt is an enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

336
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:09,020
Want it framed?

337
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:17,413
It's Iike a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

338
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:20,328
Remember me?

339
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,893
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after all.

340
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:30,416
- I need information. Maybe you can heIp.
- Thomas WeIIes. Nice picture.

341
00:40:31,373 --> 00:40:35,940
- What sort of information? I got aII different kinds.
- The kind I'II pay for.

342
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:41,810
I don't know what you're Iooking for...
...so we're cIear from the start,
I'm straight.

343
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:45,811
- CongratuIations.
- Thank you ... Zip it!

344
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,029
I can hook you up.
Name the vice,
I name the price.

345
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:53,204
-How Iong you been working here?
-AImost two years.

346
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:57,161
- What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
- Max.

347
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,771
This thing has to do
with underground pornography.

348
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:08,076
- Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally.
- There is not much illegal out there.

349
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:11,904
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good look.

350
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:16,209
If you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

351
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:20,340
You're not a cop, are you?
If I ask and you are,
you got to teII me.

352
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:22,428
I'm not a cop.

353
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,733
A private detective? Like Shaft?

354
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,429
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

355
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:33,822
- How much you make in there?
- I do not know ...

356
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,909
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

357
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:42,128
Let's pretend I Iive in the same fantasy worId..
...where you make $400 a week in that dump..

358
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:46,084
- I'II give you 500 for a few days.
- Six sounds good, Pops.

359
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:47,999
Five.

360
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:51,477
Here's my number.

361
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:59,566
- When can you start?
- WeII, tomorrow night I get off late.

362
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:02,915
- Tomorrow, then.
- AII right.

363
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,784
And don't caII me Pops.

364
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:10,089
Of course not. I wouIdn't
want to hurt your feeIings.

365
00:42:12,308 --> 00:42:16,265
I don't know what your scene is.
you may like porn as much as the next guy.

366
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:20,223
You don't look like your average
sleaze. More like your average cop.

367
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:24,702
So when you ask people
about fucking illegal stuff...

368
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,398
- ...it has a certain patina to it.
- Patina?

369
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:29,616
It's a Truman Capote word. HeIIo?

370
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:33,443
If someone never sold a snuff fiIm,
they shouIdn't care what I ask.

371
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,748
If they have, they shouId be nervous.
Whoever acts insuIted, knock on their door.

372
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:42,880
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about aII this.

373
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:47,750
There's things you'II see
that you can't unsee.
make the unseen. They stay in your head.

374
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,968
- How do you know what I've seen?
- Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their Iimit.

375
00:42:53,185 --> 00:42:56,796
I've been here six fucking years
trying to get my music together.

376
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,492
So I start part-time
where I work, to make ends meet.

377
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:04,189
And boom, a coupIe years go by,
and here I am.

378
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:08,146
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

379
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,233
Do not worry about me. But thanks anyway.

380
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:13,278
You're welcome.

381
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:19,105
Pops, you dance with the deviI,
the deviI don't change. DeviI changes you.

382
00:43:19,322 --> 00:43:21,235
- Some of your Iyrics?
- That's cute.

383
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:37,369
This pIace has been around about 3 years...
...but they keep moving it house to house.

384
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:41,109
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

385
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,892
Hey, kid!

386
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,851
I got something for you here. Come on ...!

387
00:43:54,156 --> 00:43:57,896
This is the tip of the iceberg.
Mexican S & M. ..

388
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:02,897
... Asian bondage, djursex,
if you're into that.

389
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:06,028
- Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell FriendIy.
- Ask him.

390
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:10,767
Don't do that!

391
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:14,596
- What?
- Snuff movies.

392
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:20,465
Come on!

393
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,336
AII right! It's cooI!

394
00:44:25,075 --> 00:44:29,120
- I have money! Jack!
- Gimme! Fast as hell!

395
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:32,599
Gimme!

396
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,078
Come on, Iet's go. All right!

397
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:43,471
- Are you affiIiated with law enforcement?
- Fuck you, Larry.

398
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:47,906
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affiIiated with law enforcement?

399
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:51,342
- Fuck you, Larry.
- You're getting cool there, Welles.

400
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,299
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

401
00:44:55,516 --> 00:45:00,170
But these sales won't last much longer.
It's risky, and everything's on the Net.

402
00:45:00,386 --> 00:45:02,866
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

403
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:09,041
Then there's cIassified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...
...wires through dummy corporations.

404
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:12,260
If something's iIIegaI, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

405
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:15,652
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

406
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:16,999
- How's it going, SamueI?
- I'II say hi to her.

407
00:45:21,913 --> 00:45:24,828
How are you? I Iove that.

408
00:45:25,044 --> 00:45:29,089
It's the MichaeI Jackson Iook,
with the zippers.

409
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:39,440
CHILDREN

410
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:03,140
What are these?

411
00:46:03,314 --> 00:46:05,402
Extreme bondage.

412
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:07,924
Rape fiIms.

413
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,446
Sick shit. Buy five, get one for free.

414
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:18,361
- Anything harder?
- There is nothing harder.

415
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:21,579
Snuff?

416
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:28,364
There's no such thing as snuff.
What you see is what I got, mister.

417
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,929
- Do you know where I can get some?
- Fuck off.

418
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:25,592
There she is.
It's DoubIe Slap Dorothy.

419
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:29,854
That chick couId be
a basebaII pIayer.
The swing on her is unreaI.

420
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:34,986
Some of these S & M and bondage fiIms
you'll see straddIe the line.

421
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,378
Foot fetish, orgies, shit fiIms...
...hermaphrodites, mutiIation.
It's harder than hard-core.

422
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:42,291
But mostly it is legal. - Stick.

423
00:47:42,508 --> 00:47:46,814
One guy sees it and pukes.
Another guy sees it and fall in love.

424
00:47:47,815 --> 00:47:52,120
This is the guy I toId you about.
Got the tapes?

425
00:47:52,294 --> 00:47:54,294
- $1000.
- 1200 for the two.

426
00:47:54,468 --> 00:47:57,164
- You toId Max 1000.
- I know. This is more fun.

427
00:47:57,382 --> 00:48:01,469
I raise the price, you get pissed off.
Take it or leave it.

428
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:05,644
- I thought we had a reIationship.
- Is it reaI?
- Sickest shit you'II ever see.

429
00:48:10,907 --> 00:48:15,342
Is that real?
That sure as shit looks real.

430
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:24,866
She's not breathing.

431
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:37,348
- Who makes these films?
- I don't know.

432
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:39,826
Looks like the Philippines.

433
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,087
Yeah, definiteIy the Philippines.

434
00:49:10,136 --> 00:49:12,789
Wait a minute.
That's the same girI.

435
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:15,660
Isn't that the same girI? Look!

436
00:49:17,443 --> 00:49:20,530
- It's the same ...
- They're fakes.

437
00:49:22,443 --> 00:49:25,184
That's great.

438
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:29,271
"Snuff 2: The Resurrection."

439
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:33,707
Oh, boy.
WeII, what do you expect for 1200?

440
00:49:36,446 --> 00:49:39,839
You want a beer or something?
I couId use anything.

441
00:49:40,535 --> 00:49:43,883
But I'm sorry, man.
I toId you snuff was bogus.

442
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:47,318
I just wish I wouId have
gotten you a receipt.

443
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:50,971
"Hard Spank. Max California."

444
00:49:51,711 --> 00:49:54,798
That's my oId band. We broke up.

445
00:49:54,973 --> 00:49:57,973
- When?
- Maybe about a year ago.

446
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:05,149
I don't mean any offense...
...but what are you doing
mixed up in aII this?

447
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,410
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

448
00:50:08,627 --> 00:50:12,194
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something eIse.

449
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:15,846
Thank you. I wish you owned a record label.

450
00:50:17,108 --> 00:50:20,021
Look, it beats pumping gas.

451
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,719
I don't buy it. I don't endorse it.
I just point the way.

452
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:29,500
- You said it gets to you.
- Well, hell, yeah.

453
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:33,937
Parade of losers I see every day?
What choices have I got?

454
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:39,156
The music industry is not exactIy
beating down my door.

455
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:42,591
And what about you, Tom Welles?

456
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:46,201
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

457
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,723
A daughter.

458
00:50:49,636 --> 00:50:53,680
So you got a wife and a daughter...
...and a nice little yellow house ...

459
00:50:53,898 --> 00:50:56,246
...and a dog named Shep.

460
00:50:56,464 --> 00:50:59,290
What the hell are you doing here?

461
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:03,856
Good question.

462
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:09,684
Do you get turned on at pIaces like tonight?

463
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,598
- No, I am not.
- You don't exactIy get turned off, either.

464
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:19,947
- DeviI's changing you already.
- Good night, Max.

465
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:03,130
This gentIeman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girI.

466
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,827
Yes.... enough, I remember Mary.

467
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:10,262
Mary Anne Mathews?

468
00:52:10,914 --> 00:52:15,046
She lived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

469
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,699
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

470
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:22,352
- Not yet, but I'm Iooking
into it for her parents.

471
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:27,309
CouId you get that fIowered one down for me?
That's her suitcase.

472
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:31,483
I'd forgotten about it
tiII you showed me her picture.

473
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:37,529
I suppose I aIways hoped she'd be back.
She seemed so lost.

474
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:41,529
After a time, all I couId do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

475
00:52:41,747 --> 00:52:46,791
- Can you get this suitcase
to her peopIe? If it's appropriate.
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

476
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,236
Starlight, star bright
First star I've seen tonight

477
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:41,064
Have this wish I wish tonight

478
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:49,500
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

479
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:54,371
Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.
Can I help you?

480
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:58,373
This is operator 149.
What city and listing?

481
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:03,721
I don't know. Hollywood.
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and I need an address.

482
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:06,374
Please hold for
phone number and address.

483
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,380
- I was here first.
- Sorry, I'II just be a coupIe minutes.

484
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:39,425
- Eddie Poole?
- A process server?

485
00:54:39,598 --> 00:54:44,512
No, I've been inquiring around if,
by any chance, you've seen this girI.

486
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:47,861
- You a cop?
- I'm a member of her famiIy.

487
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:52,210
- You know how much pussy
comes through here?
- PIease, if you'd just take a look.

488
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:54,863
It would've been a few years.

489
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:05,909
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.

490
00:55:08,648 --> 00:55:12,562
- Never seen her.
- You sure?

491
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:18,737
I just looked at the picture, didn't I?
Come on. I got a lot of shit to do.

492
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:25,173
Who's next?

493
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:57,963
This'II be fine.

494
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:43,363
- What kind of shit are you peddling?
- My tapes sell. People eat the shit up.

495
00:56:43,538 --> 00:56:47,670
I had three jerks returning your tapes last month.
You know how bad it has to be
for a jackass to come back...

496
00:56:47,843 --> 00:56:52,931
... with a receipt
and try to fucking return it?

497
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:56,280
- How bad?
- Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.

498
00:56:56,497 --> 00:57:01,977
Till then, fuck you!

499
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,630
Does your mother have any teeth?
If she does, send her down, you fuck.

500
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:12,905
He's not answering.

501
00:58:39,997 --> 00:58:43,737
- Hey, boss.
- There's a case of beer in there.

502
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:50,870
- How was your day?
- Great.

503
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:55,174
- Everybody here?
- Everybody but one of the chicks.

504
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:57,784
- Been watching them?

505
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:01,276
Eddie! Eddie!

506
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:16,062
- Celebrity Films.
- Eddie ...

507
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,411
- I know aII about it.
- Yeah, you know about what?

508
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:22,672
About that girI..... six years ago.

509
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,412
I know what you did to her.

510
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:30,153
- Who is this?
- You murdered her.

511
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:35,501
- You and your friends.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

512
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:40,850
You kiIIed her on fiIm.
Now you're fucked. You're all fucked.

513
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,417
Come on.

514
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,594
Give me something, Eddie.

515
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,641
It's me.

516
01:01:19,815 --> 01:01:22,424
- What do you want?
- I just got a call.

517
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:25,381
We need to talk, And not on the phone.

518
01:01:25,555 --> 01:01:28,642
So one of us has to get on a plane, all right?

519
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:31,817
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.
Fuck! Fuck!

520
01:01:47,472 --> 01:01:50,821
So you Iike to watch, paranoid fuck.

521
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:02,475
- Phone is listed under "D. Velvet" in Manhattan.
- Dino Velvet.

522
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,652
He's a producer/director/weirdo.
He's Iike the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.

523
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:10,652
- How hard is his stuff?
- How hard do you want it?

524
01:02:10,825 --> 01:02:14,565
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.
DefiniteIy not for the squeamish.

525
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:19,131
Kind of hard to come by.
Mostly out of the back of bondage magazines.

526
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:23,176
But he's got fans.
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

527
01:02:23,393 --> 01:02:29,003
He's toId me VeIvet wiII do
commissions if there's enough dough.
Nothing illegaI, but borderline.

528
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:33,569
- If a guy wants to see a transvestite in a rubber suit--
- I got the picture.

529
01:02:33,743 --> 01:02:36,222
Max, get in here!

530
01:02:37,005 --> 01:02:40,092
So......you're going to New York?

531
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,963
Maybe.

532
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:45,964
Looking like that. You'II need me.

533
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:51,226
This Frenchie guy is more
than just a fan of VeIvet fiIms.
I can get you in if you want to.

534
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:56,617
- For more money, of course.
- Plus expenses. I fly first cIass.

535
01:02:56,835 --> 01:02:58,662
So when are we leaving?

536
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:05,401
What are you doing?

537
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,577
Man, my first time in the Big Bad AppIe.

538
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:16,057
- I toId you, don't film me.
- Fine, Howard Hughes.

539
01:03:25,755 --> 01:03:29,016
You didn't say it'd be this luxurious.

540
01:03:29,147 --> 01:03:32,235
-It's the PresidentiaI suite.
-A comforting sense of humour.

541
01:03:32,452 --> 01:03:37,539
- I'll be a coupIe of doors down.
- Seriously Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

542
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:40,018
PeopIe mind their own business in fleabags.

543
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:44,541
I'm going out for a couple of hours.
U Dig up whatever Dino Velvet tapes you can find.
Get receipts.

544
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,151
Yes, sir.

545
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:51,368
My husband had five cash accounts he used.

546
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:55,718
Between November 1992 ...

547
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:59,197
... And March 1993 ...

548
01:03:59,978 --> 01:04:03,676
...he wrote one check out
to cash from each account.

549
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:10,069
My husband never dealt with money personally,
Certainly not cash.

550
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:12,851
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

551
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:16,505
When totaIIed together, the five checks...

552
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:21,461
...from the five different accounts,
they equaI $1 miIIion.

553
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:24,158
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

554
01:04:24,376 --> 01:04:29,812
I only mentioned this because...
...you asked me to look for anything unusual.

555
01:04:29,986 --> 01:04:32,682
I've got about $5000 left in cash.

556
01:04:32,899 --> 01:04:36,596
I'll need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

557
01:04:36,813 --> 01:04:42,640
- I'm very cIose to identifying the man in the mask.
- I'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

558
01:04:42,814 --> 01:04:46,947
- How will I get it to you?
- I'll give you the address.

559
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,425
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

560
01:05:54,047 --> 01:05:57,439
Who is this? In the mask, who is he?

561
01:05:58,396 --> 01:06:00,440
Come on, wake up. Who is this?

562
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:03,745
One of Dino's lunatics.
He's in a bunch of these.

563
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:08,137
- What's his name?
- I don't know. That's his whole thing.

564
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:13,486
He always wears a mask.
He calls himself Machete, No, Machine.

565
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:16,096
He calls himself Machine.

566
01:06:18,096 --> 01:06:20,313
He's a lover, man.

567
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:23,576
Definitely loves what he does for a living.

568
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:26,575
Can't say the same about you.

569
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,753
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

570
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,492
You can see they really
appreciate my styIe here.

571
01:06:43,623 --> 01:06:47,624
I'm not the kind to blend in
with the crowd, if you didn't notice.

572
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:51,233
Like these ladies here, they like my style.

573
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:58,931
- Who is it?
- This is Max CaIifornia.

574
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,149
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's, from L.A.

575
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:06,845
- My partner and I wouId like to speak to Mr. VeIvet.
- He is not here.

576
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:12,194
We have to give him a large sum of money.
If he's not interested, we'II split.

577
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:35,025
What are you taIking about?
Can't you just answer my simple question?

578
01:07:37,113 --> 01:07:40,896
I asked a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

579
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:44,027
I've been asking you that the last 10 minutes.

580
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:46,463
Sit down.
Make yourseIf comfortabIe.

581
01:07:47,289 --> 01:07:50,464
You idiot! Going to shoot in two days?

582
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:55,508
Man, you're spending my money.
Yeah, you better do that.

583
01:07:55,726 --> 01:07:57,509
Fucking asshole!

584
01:07:57,726 --> 01:08:00,292
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

585
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:10,250
- So, what can I do you for?
- We would like to order a movie.

586
01:08:10,424 --> 01:08:14,034
- We'd Iike to commission a fiIm.
A Dino VeIvet original, one of a kind.
- That's right.

587
01:08:15,122 --> 01:08:19,599
- I'm a huge admirer of yours.
- God, I Iove flattery.

588
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:23,123
You're a genius, Mr. VeIvet.
A goddamn genius.

589
01:08:23,297 --> 01:08:29,297
The only one still transferring film to video.
Nobody really appreciates
that kind of integrity anymore.

590
01:08:29,471 --> 01:08:32,602
The grain and the gritty look you get.

591
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:40,952
- Which is your favourite?
- If I had to choose, it'd either be
Choke or Devil.

592
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:45,041
The subliminaI imagery in Choke
is what gets under your skin.

593
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:50,563
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

594
01:08:50,737 --> 01:08:53,564
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

595
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,956
What kind of a budget are we taIking about?

596
01:09:01,914 --> 01:09:06,132
Five thousand now;
Five thousand upon delivery.

597
01:09:06,263 --> 01:09:11,264
Two women, one white and one black.
Hard bondage, of course.

598
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:17,307
Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation...
...I onIy have two stipuIations.

599
01:09:22,135 --> 01:09:24,658
Okay, challenge me.

600
01:09:26,006 --> 01:09:27,833
I want to watch you work.

601
01:09:28,788 --> 01:09:31,919
You don't want a franchise, do you?

602
01:09:32,137 --> 01:09:35,051
Steal the recipe for my secret...

603
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:37,312
...hot sauce?

604
01:09:38,356 --> 01:09:39,878
No.

605
01:09:41,705 --> 01:09:44,445
That's good. I appreciate that.

606
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:53,794
- Second stipulation.
- The other performer...

607
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,316
...has to be...
...that animaI you use.

608
01:09:58,534 --> 01:10:02,927
- The man in the mask.
- Machine.

609
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:12,321
I don't know.

610
01:10:12,494 --> 01:10:15,407
He might be interested.

611
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:18,451
But I think it'll cost you another...

612
01:10:21,452 --> 01:10:23,627
...five to seven grand.

613
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:28,149
- I can arrange something really special for ten.
- You can do that.

614
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:30,933
Good enough for me.

615
01:10:31,758 --> 01:10:35,281
I'll just have to put my thinking cap on.

616
01:10:39,673 --> 01:10:42,979
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

617
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:45,980
You make sure you call me
after 10 o'cIock tonight.

618
01:10:46,154 --> 01:10:48,197
10 o'cIock.

619
01:10:52,068 --> 01:10:56,547
You know, you have a very special,
very beautifuI face.

620
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:59,548
The way light hits it.

621
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,287
I'd Iike to shoot you.

622
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:05,984
- You don't mind?
- I'm camera-shy.

623
01:11:06,201 --> 01:11:09,289
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

624
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:14,594
Those are two different kinds of trust.
I hope we can do business.

625
01:11:23,597 --> 01:11:26,858
Hoyt Avenue, BrookIyn, 3 o'cIock.

626
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:31,685
I'II be there.

627
01:11:34,076 --> 01:11:37,208
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

628
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:41,817
- So are we in the movie business?
- That's for you.

629
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:44,731
- What is it?
- Money, People use it to purchase goods.

630
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:50,385
- That's awfully generous and everything
- It's not mine. Don't make a big deal.

631
01:11:50,559 --> 01:11:56,081
There's a plane ticket for the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.
This is as far as I want you to go.

632
01:11:56,255 --> 01:12:00,473
What are you talking about?
We're a team. We're partners.

633
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:05,909
Max, I'm sure you realize
these peopIe we're dealing with...

634
01:12:06,126 --> 01:12:10,650
...are extremeIy disturbed.
- That's why you need me!
I know disturbed. Look at me.

635
01:12:10,867 --> 01:12:13,867
You did a great job.
It's time for you to go home.

636
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,564
But this is, like, our big case.

637
01:12:16,782 --> 01:12:20,912
- Tom, I know what's going on, okay?
- Okay, what?

638
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:24,261
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff fiIm, right?

639
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:27,828
I can't figure out why you're involved.
Maybe the victim?

640
01:12:28,045 --> 01:12:32,263
First, who said you're right?
Second, who said anything about a victim?

641
01:12:32,437 --> 01:12:38,351
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

642
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,438
- And three?
- I forgot three.

643
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:46,440
Good, I want you to forget everything.
I want you to get on a plane to L.A.
and forget it all.

644
01:12:47,919 --> 01:12:52,267
I get calls for work on the West Coast.
I'd Iike to call you again.

645
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:55,007
You're going to look me up
and caII me?

646
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:58,920
I couId use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

647
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:03,226
- I'm not patronizing you.
- Well, thanks.

648
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,096
All right. You take care, Max CaIifornia.

649
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:15,229
All right, Tom Welles. Devil's waiting on you.

650
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:40,117
There you are!

651
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:42,378
Come and join us.

652
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:57,511
Hello, Machine.... Love your work.

653
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:05,644
Did you bring the money?

654
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,775
- It's right here.
- Good.

655
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,124
- Where are the women?
- Women...

656
01:15:15,168 --> 01:15:17,298
...they're always late.

657
01:15:23,822 --> 01:15:28,344
- What are these for?
- They're just props.

658
01:15:28,562 --> 01:15:31,649
Nice, aren't they? Machine and I ...

659
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:35,563
... were just talking about the beauty of knives.

660
01:15:38,304 --> 01:15:41,086
My guests have arrived!

661
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:48,479
Mr. W., wouId you be so kind as
to remove any firearms from your person?

662
01:15:49,435 --> 01:15:54,219
- What are you doing?
- I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

663
01:15:55,046 --> 01:15:58,525
Slowly now ... show me the gun.

664
01:15:59,743 --> 01:16:01,134
Nice and easy!

665
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:04,701
That's right. Easy.

666
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:06,874
Good.

667
01:16:07,092 --> 01:16:11,571
- Now empty those bullets onto the table.
Very carefully.

668
01:16:11,745 --> 01:16:15,310
- I don't know why you think
- Shut up, you fuck!

669
01:16:15,528 --> 01:16:19,138
I'll put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

670
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,662
That's him.

671
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:31,488
- Last bullet. The last one.
- Good boy.

672
01:16:31,705 --> 01:16:35,924
- Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.
- Yes, sir.

673
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:38,229
Machine!

674
01:16:44,448 --> 01:16:48,492
I didn't know what
to make of you at first.

675
01:16:49,622 --> 01:16:53,840
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needIes.

676
01:16:55,363 --> 01:16:59,973
Lo and behold, from right out of the bIue came...

677
01:17:00,189 --> 01:17:03,016
...an old business acquaintance of ours
to expIain everything.

678
01:17:03,234 --> 01:17:06,148
Satan ex machina!

679
01:17:07,496 --> 01:17:10,235
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

680
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:16,411
- Get it over with.
- Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

681
01:17:17,498 --> 01:17:22,500
What I could do with faces
like these on film.

682
01:17:22,716 --> 01:17:26,152
But on second thought,
why wouId I need their faces?

683
01:17:27,196 --> 01:17:30,457
You listen to me, You'll get that fiIm.

684
01:17:30,631 --> 01:17:33,371
You'll bring it back here, give it to me.

685
01:17:33,588 --> 01:17:38,241
Just so we make this
as efficient as possibIe...

686
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:40,938
...there is an incentive.

687
01:17:52,028 --> 01:17:56,246
He's got nothing to do with this.
He doesn't know anything.

688
01:17:56,463 --> 01:18:00,724
Can't you guess what I'm about to say next?!

689
01:18:01,856 --> 01:18:04,291
If you don't bring me that fiIm...

690
01:18:04,508 --> 01:18:08,639
...we're going to kiII him,
fuck him......and fiIm it.

691
01:18:11,639 --> 01:18:14,554
If that's not enough for you...

692
01:18:14,771 --> 01:18:17,511
...we're going to go after your famiIy.

693
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:21,730
I'll get the fiIm.

694
01:18:24,122 --> 01:18:27,557
Good boy. You're being very cooperative.

695
01:18:27,774 --> 01:18:30,514
Mr. Longdale here will keep you company.

696
01:18:31,819 --> 01:18:35,254
- Why me?
- Because I do not like you, Mr. Longdale.

697
01:18:45,169 --> 01:18:47,213
Mr W. ..

698
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,430
...hurry back.

699
01:18:56,128 --> 01:19:00,347
Since I met you, there isn't much you've
done that I haven't been party to.

700
01:19:00,563 --> 01:19:03,652
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up.

701
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:08,957
Or not taken the job in the first pIace.
I never expected you to get this far.

702
01:19:09,174 --> 01:19:13,306
I hired you because you're young
and completely out of your league.

703
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,307
But I underestimated your ambition.

704
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:21,090
You took one Iook at the Christian compound.
It was heady, wasn't it?

705
01:19:21,264 --> 01:19:25,308
You weren't peeking through the gates.
Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

706
01:19:25,482 --> 01:19:28,874
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us...

707
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:31,570
...as an invitation to their dinner parties?

708
01:19:31,788 --> 01:19:36,006
No, we're there to clean up the mess,
to wipe their royal asses.

709
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:41,356
You were asked to buy a snuff film.
They couldn't find one, so you paid them to make one.

710
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,355
Isn't that what happened?

711
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:46,356
She was aIive till you paid
to have her murdered?

712
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:50,182
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience? A miIIion?

713
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,880
I've been well compensated. But you, I bought cheap.

714
01:19:55,836 --> 01:20:00,576
Just because Mrs. Christian praised your discretion...
...you sat on evidence of murder,

715
01:20:00,793 --> 01:20:05,534
dragged your friend, famiIy...
...into some oId graveyard...

716
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:09,578
...to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody remembers.

717
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,840
Mary Anne Mathews.
That was her name. Her mother remembers her.

718
01:20:14,057 --> 01:20:18,494
I'm bored with this.
You know the difference between us?

719
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:23,538
I wiII survive this and profit by it,
whereas you......you wiII not.

720
01:20:23,755 --> 01:20:26,191
Now get the film.

721
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:33,496
- Did you watch it with him?
- What?

722
01:20:33,714 --> 01:20:38,497
- The snuff fiIm. Did you watch it with him?
- This isn't heIping your friend. Get the fiIm.

723
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:44,108
Did it get him off? Mr. Christian?
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

724
01:20:44,282 --> 01:20:47,804
Did you hoId his cock?
Give him the hand job...

725
01:20:48,022 --> 01:20:50,719
...while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?!

726
01:20:50,849 --> 01:20:53,631
- What are you doing?
- Trying to understand!

727
01:20:53,805 --> 01:20:57,153
- What did he want with a snuff fiIm?!
- "Why" ...?

728
01:20:57,416 --> 01:20:59,589
Yes, why? Why?!

729
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:04,417
Why did he want a fiIm...
...of a IittIe girI being butchered?!

730
01:21:05,765 --> 01:21:09,591
Because he could.
He did it because he could.

731
01:21:11,852 --> 01:21:14,157
What reason were you looking for?

732
01:21:17,897 --> 01:21:19,289
Now.

733
01:21:33,683 --> 01:21:35,510
Here.

734
01:21:35,684 --> 01:21:37,771
Shoot me.

735
01:21:45,947 --> 01:21:48,861
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

736
01:21:49,556 --> 01:21:53,252
Let him go first. Do whatever you want to me,
but let him go.

737
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:56,471
Very well. Set him free, Machine.

738
01:22:32,783 --> 01:22:34,741
- Is that it?
- That's it.

739
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:36,828
Bravo.

740
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:40,958
You don't want to miss this... Mr. Welles.

741
01:22:50,744 --> 01:22:52,439
So it ends.

742
01:22:54,657 --> 01:22:57,483
As if she never existed.

743
01:22:57,701 --> 01:23:01,572
Do not blame yourself;
You were in way over your head.

744
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:04,138
You motherfuckers!

745
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:08,878
You smalltime motherfuckers.

746
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,053
I want to know something.

747
01:23:12,313 --> 01:23:16,402
Why you're still smalltime with a
million dollars to spread around?

748
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:18,966
Million?

749
01:23:19,184 --> 01:23:23,403
Yeah! That's what Christian gave Longdale!
That's what he gave you, right?

750
01:23:23,576 --> 01:23:27,534
A million in cash?
You stupid fucking trash!

751
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:31,665
What the hell ...? Is he taIking doIIars here?

752
01:23:31,883 --> 01:23:33,622
No, he's Iying.

753
01:23:33,752 --> 01:23:36,145
Did you fuck me?

754
01:23:36,362 --> 01:23:39,101
- Did you fuck me on this?
- Of course not, Edward!

755
01:23:39,276 --> 01:23:44,798
- Then what's he talking about?
- He's saying that Longdale fucked us...

756
01:23:44,929 --> 01:23:47,930
...which is so totally, completeIy bizarre.

757
01:23:48,668 --> 01:23:50,104
Stay back.

758
01:23:50,277 --> 01:23:53,192
Stay away from me. Put the bow down!

759
01:23:53,366 --> 01:23:57,106
I toId you not to trust the prick.

760
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:02,629
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...
...among perverts and pornographers...
...the whole business would fall apart.

761
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:06,846
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legal recourse.

762
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:10,108
So if someone.....cheats us...

763
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:14,935
...that person can't be trusted.
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

764
01:24:15,153 --> 01:24:19,589
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

765
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:23,155
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

766
01:24:23,371 --> 01:24:26,025
- Eddie, take your gun out.
- Fuck you.

767
01:24:26,242 --> 01:24:28,459
Take it out now! And drop it.

768
01:24:28,633 --> 01:24:32,722
- Or I wiII shoot.
- Don't be stupid, Edward.

769
01:24:37,983 --> 01:24:40,984
Kick it in my direction.

770
01:24:43,419 --> 01:24:45,986
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

771
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,118
Action.

772
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,382
This is wrong.

773
01:25:05,556 --> 01:25:07,773
Something's wrong.

774
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:09,599
God, not like this.

775
01:25:11,425 --> 01:25:14,340
I am supposed to have...

776
01:25:14,514 --> 01:25:16,427
...something more cinematic.

777
01:25:17,341 --> 01:25:20,168
Kill them, Machine.

778
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:22,123
Kill them all!

779
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,957
Machine!

780
01:26:12,091 --> 01:26:13,917
Stop, Eddie!

781
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:16,701
I swear to Christ,
I'll shoot you in the back!

782
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:21,528
Take off the mask.

783
01:26:21,702 --> 01:26:23,745
Remove the hood! !

784
01:26:24,224 --> 01:26:26,572
Take off the fucking mask!
He's only got one bullet!

785
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:46,546
Damn!

786
01:28:06,898 --> 01:28:09,638
Amy, listen carefully.

787
01:28:09,855 --> 01:28:12,204
- Tom, where are you?
- Amy, just listen.

788
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:17,292
Take Cindy. Get out of the house now.
Go to where we spent Fourth of July weekend.

789
01:28:17,509 --> 01:28:22,859
- Why? What's wrong?
- Amy, please. I can't. I'll be there in three hours.

790
01:28:23,032 --> 01:28:27,251
- I'm on my way! Go now!
- Tom, you're scaring me.

791
01:28:27,425 --> 01:28:29,208
Please, Amy, just do it!

792
01:28:29,382 --> 01:28:32,469
Okay, bye. I'm going.

793
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:42,211
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

794
01:28:42,385 --> 01:28:45,689
LongdaIe is dead. He was killed by the men
who made the film.

795
01:28:45,907 --> 01:28:51,081
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million. The film is real!

796
01:28:51,299 --> 01:28:53,691
They killed that girl!

797
01:28:54,865 --> 01:28:58,996
- Mrs. Christian?
- I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

798
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:02,519
- I am sorry.
- I know this must be, Are you in danger?

799
01:29:02,692 --> 01:29:07,302
We must go to the police. I tell tonight,
We'll call the police in the morning.

800
01:29:07,868 --> 01:29:10,130
All right.... Eight o'cIock?

801
01:29:10,347 --> 01:29:12,173
Yes, eight o'cIock is fine.

802
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:15,479
Do you know...

803
01:29:15,652 --> 01:29:18,480
...what the poor girI's name was?

804
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,262
Mary.

805
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,784
- Mary Anne Mathews.
- Mary.

806
01:29:26,132 --> 01:29:29,307
Thank you, Mr. Welles. Goodbye.

807
01:30:22,318 --> 01:30:24,275
Amy!

808
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:30,885
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

809
01:30:31,104 --> 01:30:33,017
Are you?

810
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:35,451
Why have not you called me?

811
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:41,541
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

812
01:30:42,758 --> 01:30:44,715
You're bIeeding.

813
01:30:44,932 --> 01:30:49,498
Are those handcuffs?
Were you locked up?

814
01:30:49,629 --> 01:30:52,064
Kept from a phone? What happened?

815
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:57,761
Start taIking, Tom.
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

816
01:30:58,674 --> 01:31:01,674
You are right. Everything you say is right.

817
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:08,502
That won't do it. That's not enough, Tom.
Not anymore.

818
01:31:09,416 --> 01:31:11,981
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

819
01:31:12,198 --> 01:31:14,721
Look where we are!

820
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:17,462
Look at yourseIf!
Look at yourseIf! Look!

821
01:31:18,547 --> 01:31:23,549
You son of a bitch.
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

822
01:31:25,854 --> 01:31:29,115
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

823
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:34,551
Amy ...

824
01:31:34,769 --> 01:31:37,073
We're going to stay here a few days.

825
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:41,727
It's just a few days. I'm sorry.
There's no other way around this.

826
01:31:41,943 --> 01:31:44,293
I swear, I swear...

827
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:49,468
...I won't let anything happen to us.
I'll take care of this.

828
01:31:49,642 --> 01:31:51,033
I swear it.

829
01:31:51,207 --> 01:31:53,773
I swear it.

830
01:31:55,904 --> 01:31:58,905
Now I have to go back out.

831
01:31:59,079 --> 01:32:01,687
Where?

832
01:32:03,253 --> 01:32:06,167
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

833
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:09,254
She is the only witness.

834
01:32:09,428 --> 01:32:11,515
To what?

835
01:32:13,082 --> 01:32:15,647
We're going to be okay.

836
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:20,214
We're going to be okay.

837
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:24,997
It'll work ...

838
01:32:33,956 --> 01:32:38,173
- Tom Welles. Mrs. Christian's expecting me.
- Yes, she left instructions.

839
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,478
I have to see her now.
It's extremeIy urgent.

840
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:46,045
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own life this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

841
01:32:51,437 --> 01:32:53,219
But I just....

842
01:32:53,438 --> 01:32:57,873
No, no, I just....
....I just spoke to her.

843
01:32:58,047 --> 01:33:03,571
Her instructions were that this first envelope....
...is for Mary's famiIy.

844
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:07,528
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

845
01:33:07,745 --> 01:33:10,311
And the second envelope is for you.

846
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:17,443
Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

847
01:33:17,661 --> 01:33:19,616
I'm sorry, sir.

848
01:33:19,791 --> 01:33:21,226
Good night, sir.

849
01:33:40,665 --> 01:33:43,666
Try to forget us.

850
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:59,277
What are you doing?

851
01:34:01,148 --> 01:34:03,931
I have to go back.

852
01:34:13,977 --> 01:34:16,065
Whatever it is ...

853
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:19,804
... Wherever you were ... just forget about it.

854
01:34:20,717 --> 01:34:22,718
You stay here.

855
01:34:22,936 --> 01:34:25,067
I can't.

856
01:34:27,501 --> 01:34:31,111
And risk us?
Risk your famiIy? Why?

857
01:34:32,111 --> 01:34:35,372
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

858
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:38,591
I'll call you when it's safe to go home.

859
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:44,114
We may not be there
when you get back.

860
01:34:57,464 --> 01:35:00,813
Cindy's education, and a lot more.

861
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,555
I love you.

862
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,088
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

863
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:10,481
You think I'm fucking around?

864
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:15,873
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- What the fuck do you want?

865
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:18,743
Who's Machine? Where does he live?

866
01:36:19,525 --> 01:36:22,482
- I do not know.
- I want his name.

867
01:36:22,656 --> 01:36:24,961
I don't know his fucking name.

868
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:31,224
- I wiII never get tired of hurting you.
- I don't know his name.

869
01:36:31,397 --> 01:36:34,659
He shows up in his mask, he leaves in his mask.

870
01:36:34,832 --> 01:36:38,051
He's from New York somewhere.

871
01:36:41,748 --> 01:36:44,096
Get in the car!

872
01:36:45,748 --> 01:36:49,271
- Why?
- You're going to show me where he killed her.

873
01:36:50,141 --> 01:36:51,532
Fuck you!

874
01:36:53,794 --> 01:36:55,750
All right, you fuck.

875
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:13,015
What did you do before you brought her here?

876
01:37:13,189 --> 01:37:15,711
Tell her how beautiful she was...

877
01:37:16,843 --> 01:37:19,930
...how you'd make her a big star?

878
01:37:24,365 --> 01:37:26,671
Talk her up?

879
01:37:30,236 --> 01:37:32,714
What the fuck do you want from me?

880
01:37:36,499 --> 01:37:38,542
I want to know.

881
01:37:41,413 --> 01:37:43,935
- You want to know?
- Yes.

882
01:37:46,718 --> 01:37:49,806
She was nothing;
A Little pussy off the street.

883
01:37:50,023 --> 01:37:53,110
Girl like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

884
01:37:54,241 --> 01:37:58,286
Yeah, I taIked her up.
Told her what she wanted to hear,

885
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:03,678
That she'd be a star.....she'd make a lot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

886
01:38:03,895 --> 01:38:08,549
When I was finished, she was all
excited about her big screen test.

887
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:11,592
I called up Dino...

888
01:38:11,766 --> 01:38:15,986
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

889
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:19,072
What else you want to know?

890
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:21,638
You saw the film, right?

891
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:24,509
You know the ending.

892
01:38:25,422 --> 01:38:28,249
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

893
01:38:30,162 --> 01:38:33,423
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

894
01:38:36,729 --> 01:38:39,730
I brought her in and she...

895
01:38:40,468 --> 01:38:43,121
... Saw Machine stand in the corner.

896
01:38:44,426 --> 01:38:46,817
She started crying...

897
01:38:48,035 --> 01:38:50,558
...making these little noises.

898
01:38:52,211 --> 01:38:55,341
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

899
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,560
Dino......fed her a bunch of pills.

900
01:39:00,474 --> 01:39:03,169
Machine put down the plastic over here.

901
01:39:06,431 --> 01:39:08,648
Just started cutting her up.

902
01:39:12,171 --> 01:39:14,389
That's it. She's dead.

903
01:39:14,563 --> 01:39:17,912
She has been dead a long time
Nobody gives a shit but you.

904
01:39:32,698 --> 01:39:35,785
You wanted to know ... now you know.

905
01:39:38,393 --> 01:39:43,440
You were in here. You were here
and saw Mary Anne bleed to death from here.

906
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:46,831
Why?

907
01:39:48,091 --> 01:39:50,527
Why did you watch?

908
01:39:50,745 --> 01:39:53,179
I feIt like it.

909
01:39:54,267 --> 01:39:57,050
I never saw nobody get done.

910
01:39:57,224 --> 01:40:01,486
Why? Did you get hard? Did you come?

911
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,443
No. It made me sick.

912
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:10,575
But what do I give a shit...
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something Iike that?

913
01:40:10,792 --> 01:40:12,184
Stay down!

914
01:40:14,618 --> 01:40:17,446
It was something I did for money.

915
01:40:19,316 --> 01:40:21,622
I needed the fucking money.

916
01:40:21,795 --> 01:40:24,970
Where is she? Where did you put her body?

917
01:40:25,187 --> 01:40:29,578
I buried it in the woods.
You won't find it.

918
01:40:29,797 --> 01:40:34,754
And even if you do, what do you got?
You got a girl's skeleton, that's it.

919
01:40:34,972 --> 01:40:37,319
Without the film, you got nothing.

920
01:40:37,972 --> 01:40:42,451
All you can do is cut me loose.
Without the film, you got nothing.

921
01:40:42,625 --> 01:40:46,278
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hands behind your back.

922
01:40:47,235 --> 01:40:50,192
- Fuck you!
- Put your hands behind your back!

923
01:40:56,368 --> 01:40:58,802
What the fuck are you doing?

924
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:07,196
I'm going to kiII you.

925
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:10,457
I'm going to kiII you.

926
01:41:11,588 --> 01:41:15,023
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

927
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:20,459
You're not going to kill me.
You don't have it in you.

928
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:26,287
You going to shoot me with your own gun?
Registered in your name?

929
01:41:28,853 --> 01:41:31,158
You thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

930
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:35,592
You'll have to dig the bullets out of my head.

931
01:41:38,072 --> 01:41:42,029
That'II be nice.

932
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:46,422
Or you could dig a hole. Dig it with your own hands
and bury me next to your girIfriend.

933
01:41:46,596 --> 01:41:49,161
Go ahead. Pull the fucking trigger.
Go ahead.

934
01:41:49,335 --> 01:41:53,075
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it. You faggot!

935
01:41:55,684 --> 01:41:59,772
What do you want me to do? Start crying?
Like a baby? " I'm so sorry I killed the girl."

936
01:41:59,946 --> 01:42:01,859
Fuck you! And fuck her!

937
01:42:02,077 --> 01:42:05,992
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

938
01:42:07,295 --> 01:42:08,818
Pull the fucking trigger.

939
01:42:09,383 --> 01:42:10,992
Do it!

940
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:12,775
Do it!

941
01:42:19,646 --> 01:42:22,038
You can not do it.

942
01:42:22,299 --> 01:42:24,212
You little pansy bitch!

943
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:29,562
Look at your, Big fucking hero man.
You can't fucking do it.

944
01:42:31,561 --> 01:42:33,518
Look at him.

945
01:42:33,692 --> 01:42:36,215
Big fucking hero.

946
01:42:36,432 --> 01:42:38,824
Go on home to your wifey!

947
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:41,347
You pussy!

948
01:42:42,129 --> 01:42:44,000
You big fucking pussy!

949
01:42:45,913 --> 01:42:49,088
What are you going to do now, faggot?

950
01:42:50,653 --> 01:42:53,132
You can't go to the cops!

951
01:42:54,219 --> 01:42:58,959
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'll make a film, you faggot!

952
01:43:01,524 --> 01:43:03,656
Shit!

953
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:05,917
You punk-ass!

954
01:43:52,101 --> 01:43:54,318
Mrs. Mathews?

955
01:43:54,536 --> 01:43:56,494
It's Thomas.

956
01:43:56,667 --> 01:44:01,059
Thomas Hart. I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

957
01:44:01,233 --> 01:44:04,930
Yeah, you found her diary.

958
01:44:05,148 --> 01:44:06,931
Thank you.

959
01:44:07,104 --> 01:44:09,539
She did leave a note...

960
01:44:09,757 --> 01:44:15,627
...and her stupid boyfriend dumped her in California...
...so I told the FBI.

961
01:44:16,845 --> 01:44:19,020
Remember when ...

962
01:44:19,193 --> 01:44:24,281
... When I asked
if you wanted to know ... truth?

963
01:44:25,325 --> 01:44:27,282
...no matter what?

964
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:31,631
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

965
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:35,631
I'm sorry.

966
01:44:36,327 --> 01:44:38,372
I want to punish them for what they did.

967
01:44:39,111 --> 01:44:42,982
- Why are you saying this?
- I can hurt them.

968
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:46,591
Give me your permission, to hurt them, please.

969
01:44:47,808 --> 01:44:50,591
Tell me how much she meant to you.

970
01:44:50,678 --> 01:44:54,549
Just tell me that you loved her.
Please tell me that you loved her.

971
01:44:54,723 --> 01:44:58,853
I love her ...
I love her so much!

972
01:45:01,029 --> 01:45:03,942
I loved her so much ...!

973
01:45:10,422 --> 01:45:12,291
Who's that?
Die, you motherfucker, die!

974
01:46:55,184 --> 01:46:58,009
- New York hospital.
- Connect me to the duty nurse.

975
01:46:58,227 --> 01:47:01,924
- Emergency.
- It's Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.

976
01:47:02,098 --> 01:47:06,795
Have you admitted an adult male
with an abdominal wound...in the last 48 hours?

977
01:47:07,012 --> 01:47:09,838
- A stabbing incident.
- Abdominal wound?

978
01:47:10,013 --> 01:47:12,317
- No, not one.
- Thank you.

979
01:47:12,535 --> 01:47:16,231
I'm looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.

980
01:47:16,449 --> 01:47:21,624
- Filed a bogus report.
- We had a guy in on Monday, I think.

981
01:47:21,842 --> 01:47:25,190
- It would've been yesterday or the day before yesterday.
- Sorry.

982
01:47:25,364 --> 01:47:28,756
- Queens County Emergency.
- Hi, Lt. Anderson.

983
01:47:28,974 --> 01:47:33,453
We had a stabbing incident and supposed victim
gave us a false name.

984
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:37,714
- A male with an abdominal wound.
- Hold on. Let me check my records.

985
01:47:37,888 --> 01:47:40,454
There was a patient treated yesterday.

986
01:47:40,628 --> 01:47:44,760
- Star tattoo on his right hand?
- Yes. George Anthony Higgins.

987
01:47:44,977 --> 01:47:49,455
Insurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.

988
01:47:49,629 --> 01:47:52,979
- That's him. Can you give me an address?
- It's under her address.

989
01:47:53,196 --> 01:47:55,805
Douglaston. Need a street?

990
01:48:31,335 --> 01:48:36,380
- I reaIIy wish you'd go to church with me tonight.
- Maybe next week.

991
01:48:39,989 --> 01:48:42,293
I Iove you, son.

992
01:48:45,598 --> 01:48:48,860
I'II be home by 10. Bye-bye.

993
01:53:41,662 --> 01:53:46,184
You know the best part of killing someone?
The look on their face.

994
01:53:46,402 --> 01:53:49,620
It's that Iook....not when they're threatened...

995
01:53:49,838 --> 01:53:54,447
...not when you hurt them...
...not even when they see the knife.

996
01:53:54,621 --> 01:53:58,187
It's when they feel the knife go in.

997
01:53:58,797 --> 01:54:02,536
That's it. It's surprise.
They can not believe it's really happening.

998
01:54:02,797 --> 01:54:06,015
She had that look.

999
01:54:06,232 --> 01:54:10,364
The girl, when she knew it wasn't just porno.
You feel how hard I am?

1000
01:54:21,105 --> 01:54:22,583
Take off the mask.

1001
01:54:38,892 --> 01:54:41,675
What did you expect, a monster?

1002
01:54:49,024 --> 01:54:52,894
My name's George.
You probably knew that already.

1003
01:54:55,851 --> 01:54:58,070
Can't get your mind around it, huh?

1004
01:54:58,288 --> 01:55:02,939
I don't have any answers.
Nothing I can say will
make you sIeep easier at night.

1005
01:55:03,158 --> 01:55:06,070
I wasn't beaten. I wasn't molested.

1006
01:55:06,289 --> 01:55:08,855
Mommy didn't abuse me.

1007
01:55:09,725 --> 01:55:12,377
Daddy never raped me.

1008
01:55:12,594 --> 01:55:15,856
I'm onIy what I am.
That's all there is to it!

1009
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:30,512
There's no mystery.

1010
01:55:30,685 --> 01:55:34,338
Things I do, I do them because
I like them.

1011
01:55:35,816 --> 01:55:37,731
Because I want to.

1012
01:57:19,665 --> 01:57:21,448
Tom?

1013
01:57:21,665 --> 01:57:24,014
Is that you?

1014
01:57:26,667 --> 01:57:28,928
My God!

1015
01:57:45,714 --> 01:57:48,236
Save me.

1016
01:57:52,368 --> 01:57:54,889
Save me.

1017
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:15,733
Dear Mr. Welles. Thank you for writing
and telling me your real name....

1018
01:59:15,951 --> 01:59:18,952
... who you really are
and what really happened.

1019
01:59:19,212 --> 01:59:21,605
I'm glad those men are dead.

1020
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:24,952
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

1021
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:27,911
I will try to use the money
you sent for some good...

1022
01:59:28,084 --> 01:59:30,867
...after I get some help for myself.

1023
01:59:30,998 --> 01:59:34,912
I hated you for telling me the truth...

1024
01:59:35,129 --> 01:59:39,782
...but now I realize you and I are the only people
that ever really cared about Mary Anne.

1025
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,304
Yours truly, Janet Mathews.
