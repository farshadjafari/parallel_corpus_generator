1
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,337
Mr. Cash?

2
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,792
M... Mr. Cash?

3
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,004
Mr. Cash.

4
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,548
J.R.

5
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,760
J.R., turn it off and get to sleep.

6
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,430
Change it, J.R. Turn it off.

7
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,981
Guess which Carter that is.

8
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,402
- Anita?
- Nope. June.

9
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,571
<i>That was 10-year-old June singing.</i>

10
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,281
<i>What was the name</i>
<i>of that number?</i>

11
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,782
<i>I was gonna sing...</i>

12
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,994
Turn it off.
Do I have to come in there?

13
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,704
<i>Now here's the cut...</i>

14
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,582
Let's get to bed.

15
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,054
It's hot.

16
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,391
It's gonna be hotter tomorrow.

17
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,270
Maybe Daddy will quit us early
and we can go fishing.

18
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,481
We'll go fishing Saturday.

19
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,527
Daddy needs a good day
from us tomorrow, J.R.

20
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,738
I know.

21
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,076
- Jack?
- Mm-hm?

22
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,207
How come you're so good?

23
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,127
I ain't.

24
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:17,841
- You pick five times more than me.
- Well, I'm bigger than you are.

25
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,470
You know every story in Scripture.

26
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,640
Well, you know every song
in Mama's hymnal.

27
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,600
Songs are easy.

28
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,810
They ain't for me.

29
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,231
There's more words in the Bible
<i>than in Heavenly Highway Hymns.</i>

30
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,150
Look, J.R., if I'm gonna be
a preacher one day...

31
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,361
...I gotta know the Bible
front to back.

32
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:41,198
I mean, you can't help nobody
if you can't tell them the right story.

33
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,210
They said by noon it's gonna be 104.

34
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,172
Them radio stations say anything
to get them niggers off.

35
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,593
Ray, why don't you let J.R.
Take the babies in?

36
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,429
I told Rollins
we'd have a crop yesterday.

37
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,307
What do I say when he pulls up here
and we're shy?

38
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,268
You ready to unload that piano?

39
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,021
We're not selling Daddy's piano.

40
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,150
And I'm not the one in Bardstown
drinking every Saturday.

41
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:29,413
<i>Am I a soldier of the cross</i>

42
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,500
<i>A follower of the Lamb</i>

43
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:39,131
<i>And shall I fear to own His cause</i>

44
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,474
Eh, what's up, doc?

45
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,081
Whoa.

46
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,302
Hey, what did that...? That rooster
say when he was all blown up...

47
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,931
...by TNT and picking his feathers up
outside that henhouse?

48
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,061
"Fortunately, boy, I keep my feathers
numbered for just such an emergency."

49
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,890
I got it. I got it.

50
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,814
Can we go soon?

51
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,234
Mr. Coles gave me a dollar
to cut the whole pile and not half.

52
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,738
Go on ahead, J.R. Catch a fish.

53
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,664
<i>Put a worm on a hook</i>

54
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,544
<i>And drop it in a brook</i>

55
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,340
<i>If things go right</i>

56
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,220
<i>You'll fry some fish tonight</i>

57
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,159
Where you been? Where you been?

58
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,789
Throw that pole down. Get in the car.
In the car.

59
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,992
You hear them, J. R?

60
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,204
Do you hear them angels?

61
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,082
I can hear them, Jack.

62
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,543
They're so beautiful.

63
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,795
They're beautiful.

64
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,464
Jack?

65
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,174
Do something.

66
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,720
Do something.

67
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,413
You know what that is, J. R?

68
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,749
- You know what that is...?
- Stop it, Ray.

69
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,042
Nothing.

70
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,013
Nothing. That's what that is.

71
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,682
That's what that's worth.

72
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,684
And that's what you are.

73
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,229
Leave him alone, Ray. He didn't do this.

74
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,148
The devil did this.
He took the wrong son.

75
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,569
Stop it, Ray.
He was my best. Now he's gone.

76
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,363
Jack, please don't leave me alone.

77
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,614
Ray.
Quiet!

78
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,034
Stop it...
Quiet! Everybody, quiet!

79
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,921
You're gonna miss your bus.

80
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,769
How come they put "John"
on there, J. R?

81
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,564
Your name's J.R., not John.

82
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:32,401
Letters don't cut it in the Air Force,
Reba. They told me to pick a name.

83
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,864
Communist troops
<i>have been driven out of Seoul...</i>

84
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,741
<i>... by U.S. Forces,</i>
<i>led by General Douglas MacArth...</i>

85
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,371
Oh. What's that?

86
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,211
- Anybody seen Tommy? Hey.
- He's leaving, Ray. Come on.

87
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,507
Now, don't start crying, Mama.

88
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,928
- Be careful with that rifle, J.R.
- Yeah, I will, Mama.

89
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,140
Last month that Purvis boy
got confused and shot himself.

90
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,809
Ain't gonna be no battles, Carrie.

91
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,812
He's going to Germany.
The war is in Korea.

92
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,107
I love you.
- Love you too.

93
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,568
Take this.

94
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,033
Thanks, Mama.

95
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,620
Take care of yourself, Donzil.
Take care of my sister too.

96
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,538
I will.

97
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,791
Hey, Tommy? Be a good boy.

98
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,133
- You're gonna miss your bus.
- Yeah.

99
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,253
Excuse me. May I?

100
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,100
"Dear Vivian, I really miss you.

101
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,561
Boo hoo hoo."

102
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,772
It don't matter what you write, Cash.

103
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,610
No chassis like that's gonna stay parked
in her daddy's driveway for two years.

104
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,419
Cash.

105
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,588
Write something.

106
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,070
I saw this church in Düsseldorf
made of limestone.

107
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,613
Big as a train station.

108
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,074
We can get married there
and go to Venice.

109
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:54,079
That's in Italy, Viv. The streets
are made of water. I ain't kidding.

110
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,164
<i>Johnny...</i>

111
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,750
<i>I haven't seen you for two years.</i>

112
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,421
<i>We only dated for a month.</i>

113
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,550
<i>My daddy says there's</i>
<i>something wrong with you.</i>

114
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,179
Well, what do you say, Viv?

115
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,349
<i>I mean, I thought you said</i>
<i>you loved me.</i>

116
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:18,395
I do. Oh, I do. I...

117
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,523
<i>Well, then don't be scared.</i>
<i>You tell him that.</i>

118
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,110
<i>- You tell him I love you too.</i>
- He says that's impossible.

119
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,198
- He says that you hardly know me.
- I think I know perfect when I meet it.

120
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,200
Let's go, Cash.

121
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,077
Viv...

122
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,164
Listen, baby. You tell your daddy
I'm your man.

123
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:40,834
Tell him we'll make a family, and I'm
gonna be on the radio because I am.

124
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,754
You tell him we'll have a nice house,
and we'll be happy.

125
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,548
We'll live in Memphis.
Tell him I'll love you forever.

126
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,593
<i>- You promise?</i>
- That's a promise, Viv. You hear me...?

127
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,055
Five minutes was up
five minutes ago.

128
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,398
<i>I am Folsom Prison.</i>

129
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,902
<i>At one time they called me</i>
<i>Bloody Folsom.</i>

130
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,531
<i>And I earned the name.</i>
<i>My own prisoners built me.</i>

131
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:15,202
<i>Every block of my granite</i>
<i>is cemented by the blood of men.</i>

132
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,829
<i>Is it any wonder a man</i>
<i>sometimes went berserk...</i>

133
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,499
<i>... and fought the hated walls</i>
<i>that shut him in?</i>

134
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,210
<i>Knock it off, you.</i>
<i>Let a guy get some sleep.</i>

135
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,421
<i>This was a common scene</i>
<i>in those old days.</i>

136
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,091
<i>I had so little work for them to do.</i>

137
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,178
<i>I hear the train comin'</i>

138
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,099
<i>Comin' down the line</i>

139
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,228
<i>I can't see no sunshine</i>

140
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,984
<i>From this window of mine</i>

141
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,530
I'm stuck.

142
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:57,160
<i>When I was just a baby</i>
<i>My momma said to me, "Son"</i>

143
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,874
<i>"Always be a good boy"</i>

144
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,128
<i>"Don't you mess around with guns"</i>

145
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:11,758
<i>But I killed a man in Reno</i>

146
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,057
<i>Just to watch him die</i>

147
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:26,148
<i>When I hear that whistle blowin'</i>

148
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,110
<i>I hang my head...</i>

149
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,371
<i>- and cry</i>

150
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,780
You gonna try today, John?

151
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,407
Really try to sell something?

152
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,911
- What does that mean?
- I cleaned out your case last night.

153
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:25,541
Baby, all I found were peanut bags
and music magazines.

154
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,003
I need you to think
about what my daddy offered.

155
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,261
Viv, I'm trying. I mean,
I'm really trying to sell stuff.

156
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,653
Hello, ma'am. I'm from Home Equipment
Company over on Summer...

157
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,155
...and we have a lot of products...

158
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:01,869
Enamel colors that you can choose from,
uh, that we can...

159
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:06,123
Hello, I'm John Cash, and I'm from the
Home Equipment Company on Summer.

160
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,960
Lucretia. Lucretia, who is it?

161
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,544
Hey, you are late.

162
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,959
<i>Well, I woke up this morning</i>
<i>Looked out the door</i>

163
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,462
<i>I can tell that old milk cow</i>
<i>By the way she lowed</i>

164
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:40,759
<i>Well, if you've seen my milk cow</i>
<i>Please ride her on home</i>

165
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,100
<i>I ain't had no milk and butter</i>
<i>Since that cow's been gone</i>

166
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:54,273
<i>I've tried to treat you right</i>
<i>Day by day</i>

167
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,734
<i>Get out your little prayer book</i>
<i>Get down on your knees and pray</i>

168
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,070
<i>You're gonna need</i>

169
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,242
<i>You're gonna need your lovin'</i>
<i>Daddy's help someday</i>

170
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,749
<i>Well, then you're gonna be sorry</i>
<i>For treating me this way</i>

171
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,085
Oh, come now!

172
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,975
A little higher.

173
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,645
You're close. Little higher.

174
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,065
A little... Yeah, a little higher.

175
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,443
Now play the chord.

176
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,489
That's good.

177
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,825
Let's hear your E, Marshall.

178
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,204
There's my E.

179
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,040
Loulabelle, time to come in.

180
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,336
Jack. Jack, get in here.

181
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,463
- Let's go.
Jack.

182
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,590
Let's go, John.

183
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,348
<i>There are some people</i>

184
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,393
<i>Say you cannot tell</i>

185
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:21,360
<i>Whether you are saved or</i>
<i>Whether all is well</i>

186
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,489
<i>They say you only can hope and</i>

187
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,618
<i>Trust that it is so</i>

188
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,705
<i>Well, I was there when it happened</i>

189
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,501
<i>And so I guess I ought to know</i>

190
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,672
<i>Yes, I know when Jesus saved me</i>

191
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,551
<i>- Saved my soul</i>
<i>- The very moment He forgave me</i>

192
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,511
<i>Made me whole</i>

193
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,930
<i>He took away my heavy burdens</i>

194
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,392
<i>Lord, He gave me peace within</i>

195
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:58,188
<i>- Peace within</i>
<i>- Well, Satan can't make me doubt it</i>

196
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,940
<i>I won't doubt it</i>

197
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:03,861
<i>I'm gonna shout it...</i>

198
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,153
Viv?

199
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:14,955
Viv, open the door.

200
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,040
Viv.

201
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:24,381
Viv, don't embarrass me.
Everyone's out there watching.

202
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,764
I wanna see my daddy.

203
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:37,436
I wanna go home, John. Please.

204
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:40,856
He's just got a job sitting in there,
in San Antonio waiting for us.

205
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:43,901
- It's just sitting there, waiting.
- Viv. The guys are here.

206
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,069
My band is here in Memphis.

207
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,740
Your band? John, your band?

208
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:54,620
Your band is two mechanics
who can't hardly play.

209
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:59,333
Oh, baby, can't you hear the difference
between you and that?

210
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:04,046
You have your wife and your baby
in a dump, John...

211
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:09,635
...and another one on the way.
And we can't even make rent.

212
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,345
John...

213
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:27,194
<i>Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone</i>

214
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:33,700
<i>You'll wake up some cold day</i>
<i>And find you're alone</i>

215
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:40,791
<i>You'll call for me</i>
<i>But I'm gonna tell you, "Bye, bye, bye"</i>

216
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:47,214
<i>When I turn around and walk away</i>
<i>You'll cry, cry, cry</i>

217
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,135
<i>You're gonna cry, cry, cry</i>

218
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,806
<i>And you'll cry alone</i>

219
00:25:55,973 --> 00:26:01,603
<i>When everyone's forgotten</i>
<i>And you're left on your own</i>

220
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:07,693
<i>You're gonna cry, cry, cry</i>

221
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,280
Hey.

222
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,658
- You hate me?
- No, I don't.

223
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:17,369
That's a mean song.

224
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,080
Stupid is what it is, Viv.

225
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,125
Yeah.

226
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,133
Vi... Viv, it's just a song.

227
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,403
Excuse me, sir?
You the owner of this place?

228
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,448
- That's me.
- Hello. I'm J.R. Cash.

229
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,949
Sam Phillips.

230
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:59,119
Good to meet you, Mr. Phillips.
I'm a singer, and I got a band.

231
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,829
We've been working on some songs.

232
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:03,040
You wanna cut a record, son,
it's $4.

233
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,460
Well, what about the guys there
on the wall in the pictures?

234
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:09,671
- I mean, they pay $4?
- They're on my label.

235
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,715
Well, how do I get on there?

236
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:14,009
- You audition.
- Right now?

237
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,011
No...

238
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,430
Call my secretary, Marion,
when she comes back.

239
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,475
She's at the salon. She'll get you
an appointment next month.

240
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:25,020
- I can't wait that long, Mr. Phillips.
- Excuse me?

241
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,940
I can't wait that long.

242
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:34,321
- What about this one? I can iron it.
- No.

243
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,241
John, you can't wear that one.
It's black.

244
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,661
It's the only color of shirt we all have.
Nothing wrong with black.

245
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:44,331
- It looks like you're going to a funeral.
- Well, maybe I am.

246
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,961
<i>Yes, I know when Jesus saved me</i>
Saved my soul

247
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,965
<i>The very moment He forgave me</i>
<i>- Made me whole</i>

248
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:59,680
<i>He took away my heavy burdens</i>
<i>Lord, He gave me peace within</i>

249
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,892
<i>- Peace within</i>
<i>- Well, Satan can't make me doubt it</i>

250
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:07,521
I won't doubt it
<i>- It's real and I'm gonna shout it</i>

251
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,439
<i>I'm gonna shout it</i>

252
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,525
Hold on. Hold on.

253
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:15,028
I hate to interrupt,
but you guys got something else?

254
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,953
I'm sorry. I can't market gospel
no more.

255
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,875
So that's it?

256
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,754
I don't record material
that doesn't sell, Mr. Cash.

257
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,591
And gospel like that doesn't sell.

258
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,969
So is it the gospel
or the way I sing it?

259
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,971
Both.

260
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,974
Well, what's wrong
with the way I sing it?

261
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:45,601
I don't believe you.

262
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:51,106
- You saying I don't believe in God?
J.R., come on. Let's go.

263
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,359
No. I wanna understand.
I mean, we come down here...

264
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:56,945
...we play, and he tells me
I don't believe in God.

265
00:28:57,112 --> 00:29:01,992
You know exactly what I'm telling you.
We've already heard that song.

266
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:07,915
A hundred times. Just like that.
Just like how you singing it.

267
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,044
- Well, you didn't let us bring it home.
- Bring it...

268
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:16,590
Bring it home?
All right, let's bring it home.

269
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:21,136
If you was hit by a truck, and you
was lying out in that gutter dying...

270
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:24,515
...and you had time to sing
one song, huh?

271
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:28,352
One song people would remember
before you're dirt...

272
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,940
...one song that would let God know
what you felt about your time...

273
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,235
...here on Earth, one song
that would sum you up...

274
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,904
...you telling me
that's the song you'd sing?

275
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:43,659
That same Jimmie Davis tune
we hear on the radio all day?

276
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:47,079
About your peace within
and how it's real...

277
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,790
...and how you're gonna shout it?

278
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,168
Or would you sing
something different?

279
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,504
Something real? Something you felt?

280
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:58,173
I'm telling you right now,
that's the kind of song...

281
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,801
...people want to hear.
That's the kind of song...

282
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:03,512
...that truly saves people.

283
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,850
It ain't got nothing to do
with believing in God, Mr. Cash.

284
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,769
It has to do with believing in yourself.

285
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:19,695
Well, I got a couple songs
I wrote in the Air Force.

286
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:24,658
You got anything
against the Air Force?

287
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,952
No.

288
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,581
I do.

289
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,962
J.R., whatever you're about
to play, we ain't never heard it.

290
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,385
<i>I hear the train a-comin'</i>

291
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:47,639
<i>It's rollin' around the bend</i>

292
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:52,019
<i>And I ain't seen the sunshine</i>

293
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,480
<i>Since I don't know when</i>

294
00:30:56,315 --> 00:31:00,402
<i>I'm stuck in Folsom Prison</i>

295
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:06,033
<i>And time keeps draggin' on</i>

296
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:16,460
<i>But that train keeps a-rollin'</i>

297
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:22,090
<i>On down to San Antone</i>

298
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:27,304
<i>When I was just a baby</i>

299
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,099
<i>My momma told me, "Son"</i>

300
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:37,940
<i>"Always be a good boy</i>
<i>Don't ever play with guns"</i>

301
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,944
<i>But I shot a man in Reno</i>

302
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:46,740
<i>Just to watch him die</i>

303
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:54,081
<i>When I hear that whistle blowin'</i>

304
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:58,544
<i>I hang my head and cry</i>

305
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:04,925
<i>I bet there's rich folks eatin'</i>
<i>In a fancy dining car</i>

306
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:10,013
<i>They're probably drinkin' coffee</i>
<i>And smokin' big cigars</i>

307
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,141
<i>Well, I know I had it comin'</i>

308
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:17,354
<i>I know I can't be free</i>

309
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,735
<i>But those people keep a-movin'</i>

310
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,031
<i>And that's what tortures me</i>

311
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,025
Where you been?

312
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,986
Are you drunk?

313
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:13,660
- What happened?
- He didn't like our gospel.

314
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,456
So I played him some songs
that I wrote.

315
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,210
And we made a record, Viv.

316
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,754
I mean a real, real record.

317
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,596
We did it like six times. I had to sing
the song over and over again.

318
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:36,266
And I'm playing it, and you should've
seen Marshall, he was so nervous.

319
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,810
But, I mean, we made
a real record of my song.

320
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,730
- Oh, gee.
- I can't believe it. It's still...

321
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:50,155
Yes, sirree, you're listening
<i>to the Tennessee Farm Hour.</i>

322
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,700
Now, here's a new one
from our girl Patsy.

323
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:06,922
Good lyrics.

324
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:08,632
Did you write it?

325
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:11,260
Yeah, it won a poetry prize
<i>in Stars and Stripes.</i>

326
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,429
That was before...
That was before I set it to music.

327
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,356
Hey, flip that over for me, will you?

328
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,155
This is Bob Neal, and you're listening
<i>to the Tennessee Farm Hour...</i>

329
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,449
...brought to you
by Bronson Seed and Feed.

330
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,621
Mr. Phillips? Oh, man, I broke it.
I broke it, I broke it.

331
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,833
John. John. Broke what?
- The record, man, it's smashed.

332
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,710
Mr. Neal, he asked me to flip it over...

333
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:47,963
...and when I went to do it,
it slipped out of my hands and it broke.

334
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,549
The worst part is, I think he liked it.

335
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:52,885
John, I know.
We can do it right now.

336
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,929
- Let's get Luther and Marshall.
- We don't need to record it. Sit down.

337
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,222
- I wanna record it.
- John.

338
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:01,143
Sit down, John.
You don't have to record another one.

339
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,936
What you broke is the test press.

340
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:07,482
The factory sends me one of those
before they do a run of a thousand.

341
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,862
He's yanking your chain, Mr. Phillips.

342
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,864
Ain't no way nobody
could be that dumb.

343
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,490
Leave him be, Jerry Lee.

344
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,960
John?
Hmm?

345
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,672
When are we gonna talk about...

346
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,592
...how this tour is gonna work?

347
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,011
Because you're...

348
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,350
...out of town three out of four weeks
for the next three months.

349
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,144
Well...

350
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,565
You wanted it.
- Viv, I don't believe it.

351
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,275
He's playing it again.

352
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,069
<i>Them folks at Sun tell me...</i>

353
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:54,780
<i>... this boy starts a
<i>four-state tour next week.</i>

354
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,744
Ho-ho! Son of a gun!

355
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,580
We got a baby sleeping. Come on.

356
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:12,005
Vivian, you hear that?

357
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,509
Hey! Hey, that's my song!

358
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,052
Oh, the baby.

359
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,191
Hear Daddy in the wind?

360
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:37,281
<i>Cry, cry, cry</i>

361
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,575
I think she really likes it.

362
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:56,383
<i>My name is Jerry Lee Lewis</i>
<i>Come from Louisiana</i>

363
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,094
<i>Gonna do a little boogie</i>
<i>On this here piano!</i>

364
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,972
<i>Doing mighty fine</i>
<i>Gonna make you shake it</i>

365
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,850
<i>Gonna make you do it</i>
<i>Make you do it till it breaks</i>

366
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,436
<i>Called the Lewis Boogie</i>
<i>In the Lewis way</i>

367
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:11,690
<i>Lord, I do my little boogie-woogie</i>
<i>Every day</i>

368
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,031
Never seen nobody play like that.

369
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:29,249
<i>Well, down in New Orleans</i>

370
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:32,044
<i>The land of dreams</i>
<i>The best doggone place, son</i>

371
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,630
<i>You ever have seen</i>
<i>Yeah, the cats go wild</i>

372
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,841
<i>With a boogie that's hot</i>
<i>And my boogie makes you want to stop</i>

373
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,093
<i>And do the bop</i>
<i>It's called the Lewis Boogie</i>

374
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,012
<i>In the Lewis way</i>

375
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:47,601
<i>I do my little boogie-woogie</i>
<i>Every day!</i>

376
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,775
Jerry Lee Lewis, ladies and
gentlemen. "The Killer," Jerry Lee Lewis.

377
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,570
Grab yourselves a pine box, boys.

378
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,781
Nobody follows "The Killer."

379
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:05,285
These next boys have just put out
their first record called "Cry, Cry, Cry."

380
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,829
Oh, shoot. Now I'm late.

381
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:10,082
Oh, my gosh. Excuse me.

382
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,002
That's my cue. Oh, no, y...
Oh, that's stuck right on my dress.

383
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:18,382
- Hey, Bill. Hold on, Bill. I'm coming.
- I think...

384
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,219
Oh, my, I think I hear June Carter's
voice, ladies and gentlemen.

385
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:27,224
I'll be right there, Bill.
I'll be right there.

386
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:29,434
Reckon when, June?

387
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,896
Well, Bill, I got tangled.

388
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:37,860
- In what, June bug?
Johnny Cash's guitar strap.

389
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:42,155
Don't worry, I can keep this funny
for at least two minutes.

390
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:45,701
And I'll tell you what, Bill.
He's a strapping boy, that Johnny Cash.

391
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:49,121
And his guitar strap's
pretty strapping too.

392
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,250
Here. I love that "Cry" song,
by the way.

393
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,210
Hey, thanks.

394
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:57,212
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

395
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:01,592
Bill. Bill, I had to come and tell you.
I had to tell you.

396
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,721
I had to tell you.
I just can't sing tonight.

397
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,349
You best be getting out here.

398
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,893
Yeah.

399
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:13,854
Bill, I got the laryngitis.

400
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,439
Me too.

401
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:18,025
June, we just...
- I do. Y'all laughing, but I do.

402
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:22,404
We all just heard you hollering
up a storm backstage.

403
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,241
Well, I didn't have it then, Bill.

404
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

405
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,632
All right, June's gonna be back
to sing later.

406
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,634
Her family's also with us tonight.

407
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,804
But like I was saying, these boys
up next are hotter than a pistol.

408
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:51,600
They are burning up the radio
with their new hit, "Cry, Cry, Cry."

409
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:54,645
And I wanna make sure we give them
a big Texarkana welcome.

410
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:58,232
So here they are, folks. New passengers
on the Sun Rocking Railway...

411
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,901
...Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Two.

412
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:17,251
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.

413
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:32,140
<i>Hey, get rhythm</i>
<i>When you get the blues</i>

414
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:36,603
<i>Come on, get rhythm</i>
<i>When you get the blues</i>

415
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:39,189
<i>Get a rock 'n' roll feelin'</i>
<i>In your bones</i>

416
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,567
<i>Get taps on your toes</i>
<i>And get gone</i>

417
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:45,654
<i>Get rhythm when you get the blues</i>

418
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,700
<i>Little shoeshine boy</i>
<i>Never gets low down</i>

419
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,577
<i>But he's got the dirtiest</i>
<i>Job in town</i>

420
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:55,873
<i>Bendin' low at the people's feet</i>
<i>On the windy corner of a dirty street</i>

421
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,041
<i>Well, I asked him</i>
<i>While he shined my shoes</i>

422
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,210
<i>How he'd keep</i>
<i>From getting the blues</i>

423
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,212
<i>He grinned as he raised his little head</i>

424
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,381
<i>He popped a shoeshine rag</i>
<i>And then he said</i>

425
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:08,594
<i>"Get rhythm when you get the blues</i>

426
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,557
<i>Come on, get rhythm</i>
<i>When you get the blues</i>

427
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:15,726
<i>Yes, a jumpy rhythm</i>
<i>Makes you feel so fine</i>

428
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,520
<i>It'll shake all the trouble</i>
<i>From your worried mind</i>

429
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:22,316
<i>Get rhythm when you get the blues"</i>

430
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:40,751
All right.

431
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,213
<i>Well, I sat down to listen</i>
<i>To the shoeshine boy</i>

432
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,590
<i>And I thought I was gonna jump for joy</i>

433
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,634
<i>Slapped on the shoe polish</i>
<i>Left and right</i>

434
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,969
<i>He took a shoeshine rag</i>
<i>And he held it tight</i>

435
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:52,930
<i>He stopped once</i>
<i>To wipe the sweat away</i>

436
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,641
<i>I said, "You're a mighty little boy</i>
<i>To be a-workin' thataway"</i>

437
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,351
<i>He said, "I like it"</i>
<i>With a big, wide grin</i>

438
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,269
<i>Kept on a-poppin' and he said again</i>

439
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:03,190
<i>"Get rhythm when you get the blues</i>

440
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,566
<i>Come on and get rhythm</i>

441
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,901
All right!

442
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,237
<i>When you get the blues</i>

443
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,781
<i>It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe</i>

444
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,075
<i>It does a million dollars' worth</i>
<i>Of good for you</i>

445
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:18,580
<i>Get rhythm when you get the blues"</i>

446
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,840
Thank you. Thank you very much.

447
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:29,925
<i>Well, I love that hair, long and black</i>

448
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,010
<i>Hanging down to the middle of your back</i>

449
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:35,806
<i>Don't cut it off, whatever you do</i>
<i>I need it to run my fingers through</i>

450
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:39,393
Viv, I'm telling you, I think this is
the best show we've ever done.

451
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,646
Hell, it might be the best show
I've ever seen, no kidding.

452
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:46,441
<i>Where are you?</i>
- Texarkana. Baby, I miss you.

453
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,362
Hey, do you hear Orbison doing our
song? He turned it to a two-step. Listen.

454
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,796
- Do you hear that?
<i>- Damn it.</i>

455
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:09,006
What's the matter?

456
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,509
<i>Damn it. Roseanne just ran</i>
<i>her head into the table.</i>

457
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:15,929
<i>Roseanne.</i>
<i>Roseanne. Here, talk to Daddy.</i>

458
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,515
Hey, Roseanne? Hey, it's Daddy.

459
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:22,519
Honey, don't, don't cry.
Daddy's gonna be home real soon.

460
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,229
<i>- John, I have to go.</i>
- Huh?

461
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,231
<i>I have to go, John.</i>

462
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,859
Bye.

463
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:38,785
Hey, y'all say hi to Johnny Cash.
Dad, he wrote that "Cry, Cry, Cry" song.

464
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:40,204
Mother Maybelle.

465
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,415
- How you doing, Johnny Cash?
- Good. Heck, I'm great, ma'am.

466
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,709
- Hello, John, I'm Ezra.
- Yeah, I know.

467
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:50,005
- It was nice to meet you, son.
- Real good to meet you, sir.

468
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:16,406
<i>I walked into a honky-tonky</i>
<i>Just the other day</i>

469
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:20,285
<i>I dropped a nickel in a jukebox</i>
<i>Just to hear it play</i>

470
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:24,331
<i>I didn't have no tune in mind</i>
<i>I didn't wait to choose</i>

471
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:28,961
<i>Just dropped a nickel in the slot</i>
<i>And played the Jukebox Blues</i>

472
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:38,512
<i>There's a guy in there</i>
<i>With an old tin horn</i>

473
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,514
<i>And a feller on an old banjo</i>

474
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,766
<i>And the man on the fiddle</i>
<i>He wasn't no slouch</i>

475
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:45,102
<i>He could really drag that bow</i>

476
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,233
You sounded good tonight, Cash.
Real tight.

477
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,652
Oh, thanks, man.

478
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,321
You want some chili fries?

479
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,740
Oh, no, that's okay.

480
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:02,911
She's been in the spotlight since
you and me was biting ankles.

481
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:05,372
They say Maybelle
had a crib at the Ryman...

482
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:08,375
...so she could pull her out
and let her whoop and holler...

483
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,711
...and pop her back in
and go to sleep.

484
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:12,379
<i>It must have been a drum</i>

485
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:16,884
<i>It gave that song a solid beat</i>
<i>Boy, he was goin' some</i>

486
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:28,395
<i>I walked into a honky-tonky</i>
<i>Just the other day</i>

487
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:32,232
<i>I dropped a nickel in a jukebox</i>
<i>Just to hear it play</i>

488
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:36,570
<i>I didn't have no tune in mind</i>
<i>I didn't wait to choose</i>

489
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:40,574
<i>Just dropped a nickel in the slot</i>
<i>And played the Jukebox Blues</i>

490
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:52,461
<i>I've played a lot of jukeboxes</i>
<i>Most every one in town</i>

491
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:56,965
<i>But that's the first tune I ever heard</i>
<i>That could make one dance around</i>

492
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,761
<i>Play the Jukebox Blues</i>

493
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:04,890
<i>Such a rhythm I never heard</i>
<i>I danced out both of my shoes</i>

494
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:19,196
- We're leaving in an hour, John.
All right.

495
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,284
Oh, that's a sweet story, honey.

496
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,745
All right.

497
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,497
No.

498
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,333
I'm leaving in, like, five minutes.

499
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:33,710
All right.

500
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,129
Is everything else all right?

501
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,174
I love you too.

502
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:43,595
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
How you doing?

503
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,556
- Coffee?
- Yeah...

504
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,599
...and some toast, please.

505
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:53,313
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

506
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,815
Good. Do you mind?

507
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:56,483
No, not at all.

508
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,111
- Did you lose your voice?
- I did.

509
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,154
I was just singing my heart out
up there.

510
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:05,242
I got to ask you how you came up
with that sound.

511
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:06,535
What sound?

512
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:10,706
That sound everybody's talking about.
Steady like a train. Sharp like a razor.

513
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:15,210
Well, we'd play faster if we could.

514
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:18,797
You know, I guess
it just come out like that.

515
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,384
I gotta close my register.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

516
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:26,430
Thank you.

517
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:30,934
Here's a picture of my wife, Viv.

518
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:34,605
- My baby, Roseanne.
- Oh, look at her. She's beautiful.

519
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,065
Thanks. Got another one on the way.

520
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:38,734
- I got a little girl too.
- Yeah?

521
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:41,820
Her name's Carlene. Yeah.
She's about the same age.

522
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:48,911
When I was in the service,
I used to look at pictures of you.

523
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:51,205
- You know, in magazines.
- Oh.

524
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,959
No. No, it wasn't like that.

525
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,420
I mean, I...
I liked your music, you know?

526
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:00,214
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

527
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,384
I mean, I... You were... Well, you are...
I mean, I... I kept track of you.

528
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,887
Yeah, you and your family, you know.

529
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:09,640
I listened to your voice my whole life,
you know?

530
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:14,937
Now, me and my brother, Jack,
we always listened to your songs.

531
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,105
- You know, like "Swallerin' Place."
- Yeah.

532
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:20,526
Yeah, we liked it
when you'd sing one alone.

533
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:23,612
Well, you and Jack are the only ones.

534
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,283
- What do you mean?
- I'm not really much of a singer, John.

535
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,287
I mean, I got a lot of personality,
I got sass.

536
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:36,500
I give it my all, but my sister Anita's
really the one who's got the pipes.

537
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,544
- Well, who said that?
- Everybody.

538
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,420
My mama, my daddy.

539
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:44,800
That's how come I learned to be funny.
So I'd have something to offer.

540
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,971
Well...

541
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,640
Parents aren't always
the best judge of things...

542
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:53,517
...you want my opinion.

543
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:59,982
So how long you on the tour?

544
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,151
Another couple of weeks.
We just got on board...

545
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,697
...but I tell you,
it feels like a lot longer.

546
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:08,365
I'm sure.

547
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:10,492
I'm headed off.
I'm going to the Ryman.

548
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:13,495
Tell your brother Jack to tune in,
I'll sing him something.

549
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:14,997
What does he like?

550
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:19,459
Oh, that's... That's sweet.
But he passed.

551
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,754
I'm sorry. Were y'all real close?

552
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,676
Yeah. Yeah, he's, uh...

553
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:36,185
It's funny, I ain't talked about Jack
in a long time, you know? It's...

554
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:42,191
After he died, I...
I talked about him all the time...

555
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:47,196
...but I guess people grew tired of it.

556
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:49,781
So I just stopped.

557
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:57,664
John?

558
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:03,795
You're tired, aren't you?

559
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,050
Yeah.

560
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:10,969
It'll slow down.

561
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,640
It will.

562
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:18,060
I better get going.

563
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,145
It was good to talk to you.

564
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:21,855
- You too.
- Take care.

565
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:25,150
Hopefully, I'll see you soon.
- You better tune in.

566
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:28,820
- I'll sing you that "Swallerin' Place."
- I will. I really will.

567
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,697
Okay.

568
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:45,170
That's fine. That's... That's perfect.

569
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,964
Yes, ma'am.

570
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,594
When was the last time you heard him
moving around in there?

571
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,763
I don't know.

572
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:07,067
Thought you were gonna
help me today, John.

573
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,034
You head out tomorrow.

574
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:18,704
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

575
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:23,333
Better start living life here with us
when you come home...

576
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,627
...before you have to leave again.

577
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,883
You know, I was thinking.

578
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:33,760
You know, maybe I could get Bob
to push my dates.

579
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,722
I'm happy when I'm here.

580
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:41,226
I like waking up and seeing your face.

581
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:53,780
John, those bags over there...

582
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:59,036
Those letters in there
are 10-to-one from girls.

583
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:03,332
Ten to one. And they're obscene.

584
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,501
Reba's been trying to answer
some of them.

585
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,211
Half of them ain't even 15...

586
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:10,881
...and they are sending pictures
of themselves in bathing suits.

587
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:14,635
Pictures for you to look at
while you're doing time at Folsom.

588
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,389
- Oh, Viv.
- This one girl, she sent you her diar...

589
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:22,226
Viv, don't even read
those letters, they're...

590
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,937
It's just crazy right now, that's all.

591
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:26,855
You know.

592
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,900
Hell, you should have seen last week.

593
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:32,569
We was at the fair...

594
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:35,364
...and this bus full of 4-H girls
pulls up, you know...

595
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:37,533
...and they come piling out of there.

596
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,702
They go running, screaming
after Carl and Roy. I mean, running.

597
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:44,081
John. I have a casserole in the oven
and your sister...

598
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:47,751
...in the kitchen, and I don't want
to talk about the tour.

599
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:52,130
Well, Viv, you, you're the one
that brought it up.

600
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:55,300
In fact, that's my new rule.

601
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:56,802
When you come home...

602
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,013
...I wanna get right down
to talking about regular things.

603
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,224
Viv, don't give me no rules.

604
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,268
All I got are rules.

605
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:06,645
All I got is to be
at this place at this time.

606
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:07,980
I'm trying to go there...

607
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:10,691
...and I'm trying to spend time
with you, the kids.

608
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:13,443
And write songs through this.
What do you want from me?

609
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,322
I got you your dream house. All of your
things, all the pretty little things.

610
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:20,325
I got you your car.
What do you want from me?

611
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:26,456
I want you, John. I want you. And I
want everything that you promised me.

612
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:29,751
Well, what if I can't do that?

613
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:59,531
Got your mind on something?

614
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,410
What are you doing up there, man?

615
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,079
I'm building a bomb.

616
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,665
Where are we going again?

617
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:11,877
Tyler. George Jones' show.

618
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,880
Where was it we just was?

619
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,799
- Have another one, Carl.
Austin, Carl.

620
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,635
That's where y'all picked me up.

621
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:22,054
Hey, John,
you seen the new charts?

622
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:24,056
"Cry, Cry, Cry" was 14, I think.

623
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,350
Yeah, I heard that,
but I haven't seen it.

624
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,103
Wherever we've been, I can tell you
where we're going.

625
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,566
Everybody in this car's going to hell.

626
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:37,236
And what about the car up there?

627
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:40,280
We're all going to hell
for the songs we sing.

628
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,491
People who listen to them
will go to hell too.

629
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,743
You shut up with that.

630
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:46,787
God gave us a great big apple, see?

631
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,455
And he said, "Don't touch it."

632
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:52,334
He didn't say touch it once in a while
or take a nibble when you're hungry.

633
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:54,461
He said, "Don't touch it."

634
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,755
Don't think about touching it.

635
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:58,423
Don't sing about touching it.

636
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,510
Don't think about
singing about touching it.

637
00:55:04,805 --> 00:55:08,642
And what about me, Jerry Lee?
Am I going to hell?

638
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,437
No, June. You're beautiful.

639
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:16,149
Sleepy is what I am.

640
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:21,113
She's making me fall in love with her.

641
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,578
Feel my heart. Come here. Sincerely.

642
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:30,330
Feel my heart, baby.
It's just a-beating for you.

643
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:31,957
- Stop.
Come on, feel it.

644
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:33,500
- I'm falling for you.
Hey.

645
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,878
- No, you're not. Jerry Lee.
Jerry Lee.

646
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:37,087
Come on.

647
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:39,965
Sit your ass down. Just sit down.

648
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,010
The 1957 Chevrolet.
<i>There's new designs...</i>

649
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:46,096
Looks like we're here.

650
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:48,015
Oh, thank goodness.

651
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:50,851
Get me out of this car
and all these boys.

652
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,532
Let's go. Home sweet home, boys.

653
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:09,620
You can just put those
right there. That'd be great.

654
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,875
Oh, wait. I wanted
to give you that Billboard.

655
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:17,836
Oh, right.

656
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:21,340
It's in here somewhere.

657
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,093
You got a library in there, June.

658
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:31,391
Here it is. I circled it for you.
It's right there.

659
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,352
Yeah, 14.

660
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:37,147
I can't believe it.

661
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:41,860
Um, I wanted to give you this.

662
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:46,740
I just finished it. It's really amazing.

663
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,701
<i>- "The Prophet"?</i>
- Yeah.

664
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,411
Keep it.

665
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,664
- Oh, no. You don't...
- Whenever I finish a book...

666
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:56,750
...I give it away to somebody.
It just lightens my load.

667
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:00,420
John.

668
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:07,886
I just went through a terrible divorce.

669
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:13,392
And I got a world of judgment
on me right now.

670
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:20,357
And, um, it's really
none of my business...

671
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:23,527
...but you seem like you have
a nice family.

672
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:28,657
I'm sorry. It just happened.

673
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,493
Just happened?

674
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:33,745
Yeah.

675
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:38,417
And you wear black because you can't
find anything else to wear?

676
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:41,920
You found your sound
because you can't play no better?

677
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:45,340
And you just tried
to kiss me...

678
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:47,092
...because it just happened?

679
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:54,933
You should try taking credit
for something every once in a while.

680
00:57:56,977 --> 00:57:58,937
John.

681
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:11,200
- Hey, Luth.
- Hey, John.

682
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,285
You okay?

683
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:15,954
I'll let you know in a few minutes.
How you doing?

684
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:19,833
Okay. That boy Elvis
sure likes to talk poon.

685
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:22,711
That's all I heard since Lubbock.

686
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:27,090
- You want some?
- What is it?

687
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:32,095
They'll make you wanna drive
all the way to Jacksonville...

688
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,723
...and enjoy yourself
once you get there.

689
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:37,351
Elvis takes them.

690
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:40,771
Yeah.

691
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:45,984
Yes, sir.
Try some.

692
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:48,111
That's a lot. Be careful.

693
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,030
Here comes Marshall with his bomb.

694
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:53,617
You got your lighter, J. R?
- Yeah.

695
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:57,412
All right, you help me
get up in there. Grab that fuse.

696
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,540
How long we got us after we light it?

697
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,750
About 30 seconds a foot.

698
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:03,877
All right.

699
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,214
He light it?
Does your wife know...

700
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:08,590
...you like to blow stuff up?

701
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:12,427
Sure she does. That's why
I married her, John.

702
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:13,971
Well, you light it?

703
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,431
There's a bomb up there...

704
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,060
It'll go.

705
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:23,981
It didn't work.

706
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:25,983
Way to go, Johnny boy.

707
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,366
<i>It was around about four</i>
<i>And I thought she would stop</i>

708
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,910
<i>She looked at me</i>
<i>And then she looked at the clock</i>

709
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:39,997
<i>She said, "Now, wait a minute, Daddy</i>
<i>Now, don't you get sore"</i>

710
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:43,125
<i>"'Cause all I want to do</i>
<i>Is rock a little bit more"</i>

711
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:48,213
<i>'Cause she's my rock 'n' roll Ruby</i>
<i>Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll Ruby</i>

712
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,049
<i>Rock 'n' roll</i>
<i>When Ruby starts a-rockin'</i>

713
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,886
<i>It satisfies my soul</i>

714
00:59:55,721 --> 01:00:01,435
<i>One night my Ruby left me all alone</i>
<i>I tried to contact her on the telephone</i>

715
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,937
<i>I finally found her about twelve o'clock</i>

716
01:00:04,146 --> 01:00:07,357
<i>She said, "Leave me 'lone, Daddy</i>
<i>'Cause your Ruby wants to rock"</i>

717
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,193
<i>'Cause she's my rock 'n' roll Ruby</i>

718
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:13,572
<i>Rock 'n' roll</i>
<i>Rock 'n' roll Ruby, rock 'n' roll</i>

719
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,326
<i>When Ruby starts a-rockin'</i>
<i>Man, it satisfies my soul</i>

720
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,836
Thank you. Thank you very much.

721
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:33,342
How about them boys, huh?

722
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,470
Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Three.

723
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:38,931
- You kicked it good tonight, John.
Thanks, man.

724
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:40,766
That's right. Kiss his ass.

725
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:42,601
Hey, Jerry Lee,
your mama know you're out?

726
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:44,478
She knows.

727
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:46,188
She knows.

728
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:48,607
How about that Johnny Cash,
everybody?

729
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,193
Johnny Cash.

730
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:03,830
<i>Well, that's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

731
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,874
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

732
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,626
<i>Just any way you do</i>

733
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:10,838
<i>Well, that's all right, that's all right</i>

734
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:14,299
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>

735
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,802
<i>Any way you do</i>

736
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,638
<i>Well, Mama, she done told me</i>

737
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:21,139
<i>Papa done told me, too</i>

738
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:23,642
<i>Said, "Son, that gal you're foolin' with</i>

739
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,310
<i>She ain't no good for you"</i>

740
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:28,480
<i>Well, that's all right</i>
<i>That's all right</i>

741
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,650
<i>Now, that's all right now, Mama</i>

742
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:34,278
<i>Any way you do</i>

743
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:35,821
Okay.

744
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:54,798
Mr. Cash?
Yeah?

745
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:57,176
There's a Miss Audrey Parks
here to see you.

746
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,595
Who?

747
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,431
Audrey Parks.

748
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:11,273
Hey.

749
01:02:19,031 --> 01:02:22,242
<i>Well, that's all right</i>
<i>That's all right</i>

750
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:28,207
<i>Now, that's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

751
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,501
<i>Oh, get it now!</i>

752
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:39,426
Ray, why don't you say grace?

753
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:43,430
Mama, it's J.R.'s table.
Why don't you say grace, J. R?

754
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,682
No, go ahead, Pa.

755
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:14,336
<i>I go out on a party</i>

756
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:17,506
<i>And look...</i>

757
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:23,011
<i>I go out on a party</i>

758
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:27,599
<i>And look for a little fun</i>

759
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:31,478
<i>I found...</i>

760
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:35,816
<i>But I find a...</i>

761
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:38,026
Shit.

762
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:48,704
<i>But I find a darkened corner</i>

763
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,555
<i>Go out on a party</i>

764
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:56,104
<i>And look for a little fun</i>

765
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:03,862
<i>But I find a darkened corner</i>

766
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:23,465
<i>'Cause I still miss someone</i>

767
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:35,727
<i>'Cause I still miss someone</i>

768
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:43,277
Hi.
- Hi.

769
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:55,706
You're June Carter, ain't you?
Oh, my. Betsy Purvis.

770
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:57,374
Hi, Betsy.
So nice to meet you.

771
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,168
- We're coming to the show.
- Wonderful.

772
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:02,963
- This is my husband, Lloyd.
Hi, Lloyd. So nice to meet you.

773
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,882
You know where
the fishing tackle is?

774
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:08,427
- Back of them footballs on the corner.
- All right, great.

775
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:11,847
Enjoy the show. And if you have
any requests, just holler them out.

776
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,348
Good morning.
- Hey.

777
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,225
She's even prettier in person.

778
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:38,832
Can I help you?
- Oh, I'm looking for some lace.

779
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:42,252
Oh, the sewing store on Saticoy's
got lace.

780
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,588
Thank you.

781
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,341
You know, your ma and pa...

782
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:49,760
...are good Christians
in a world gone to pot.

783
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:51,637
Well, I'll tell them you said that.

784
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:53,805
I'm surprised they still speak to you.

785
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:56,725
After that stunt with Carl Smith.

786
01:06:56,934 --> 01:07:00,854
Divorce is an abomination.
Marriage is for life.

787
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:05,651
I'm sorry I let you down, ma'am.

788
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:24,628
- Hey.
Hey.

789
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:26,129
What's funny?

790
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:29,091
You've been standing in that
spot for about 10 minutes...

791
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:31,134
...staring at that Polly Pepper book.

792
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:36,431
Well, I can't... I can't figure which
one Roseanne would like more.

793
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:38,976
She got brown hair,
which makes me think this one.

794
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,562
- Right.
- But this is "Baby Sisters."

795
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,897
And she got a baby sister, and...

796
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,692
Well, I got that one for Carlene,
and she liked it.

797
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:51,071
- Mm-hm. I missed her birthday.
- Oh.

798
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:53,115
So I wanted
to get her something more...

799
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:56,034
...you know? Like one
of these dollhouses.

800
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,453
But I don't know how
to get it out to her.

801
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,581
Want me to help you?

802
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:07,421
I think there's a lake right
up around the corner.

803
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:18,807
- You got a hitch in your giddyup?
- Yeah.

804
01:08:39,077 --> 01:08:41,747
Forgot how much I like this.

805
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,085
Hey, June? I never used one of these
fancy reels before.

806
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:49,546
Well, what'd you use, a sapling?

807
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,340
Yeah.

808
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:53,800
Okay, hold on. I'll help you.

809
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:56,887
It's like there's some kind
of lock on it or...

810
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,598
No. My daddy taught me
how to do this, I'll show you.

811
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:01,433
Keep your thumb there
on the button.

812
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,935
That loosens the line.

813
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:04,937
And then you're gonna bring it back.

814
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:06,897
Then you're gonna throw it out there.

815
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:09,942
And then when you're ready,
if you got a good spot for it...

816
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:12,110
...you let go of the button. All right?

817
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:14,196
- Sidearm?
- Yeah, sidearm.

818
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:15,697
All right.

819
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:19,952
See? There you go.

820
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:43,767
<i>Just around the corner</i>
<i>There's heartache</i>

821
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:49,773
<i>Down the street that losers use</i>

822
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:54,945
<i>If you can wade in</i>
<i>Through the teardrops</i>

823
01:09:55,737 --> 01:10:00,242
<i>You'll find me</i>
<i>At the Home of the Blues</i>

824
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:05,873
<i>Yeah, you're gonna find me at</i>
<i>The Home of the Blues</i>

825
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:18,260
Hey, folks, what do you say
we get June Carter out here again?

826
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,137
Maybe she'll sing with me.

827
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:21,638
No, no, no. No.

828
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:23,891
Oh, come on, June.
I never sing with you.

829
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,560
I got my slippers on,
and I'm not coming out there.

830
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:28,854
They don't care
if you got your slippers on.

831
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:30,898
Come on,
it's the shank of the evening.

832
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,317
Folks, let's hear it. June. June.

833
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:34,943
<i>June, June, June.</i>

834
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,654
<i>June, June, June.</i>

835
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:41,241
<i>- June, June, June.</i>
- Come on, June, prove Elvis wrong.

836
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:44,661
He says you can't do nothing
that ain't written in your calendar.

837
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:47,956
<i>June, June, June,</i>
<i>June, June, June.</i>

838
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:01,386
See, June?
They wanna see us together.

839
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:04,473
All right. Quit that clutching on me
and I'll sing with you.

840
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,642
But you gotta quit clutching on me.

841
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:08,727
Hi, folks. How y'all doing again?

842
01:11:08,894 --> 01:11:11,480
I hope y'all don't mind my bare feet.

843
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:13,315
So, what are we gonna sing, Johnny?

844
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:15,901
You got me out here.
Is that where your plan ends?

845
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:19,446
Well, I always liked
that song of yours:

846
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:21,657
"Time's a-Wastin'."
Let's do that one.

847
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:25,786
Oh, come on. I don't know about that.
How about your hit song, "Big River"?

848
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,663
That's a good song.

849
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:29,831
Well, "Big River" ain't a duet.

850
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:33,168
- Uh, let's do "Time's a-Wastin'."
- I am not gonna sing that song.

851
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:37,005
It's inappropriate. I recorded it
with my ex-husband. I will not sing it.

852
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,924
No better way to put it behind you.

853
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:41,844
- I'm not gonna do it.
- June, just sing.

854
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,471
<i>- I've got arms</i>
<i>- And I've got arms</i>

855
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:47,182
<i>Let's get together and use those arms</i>

856
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:49,434
<i>Let's go</i>

857
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:52,062
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>

858
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,314
<i>I've got lips</i>

859
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:55,816
<i>And I've got lips</i>

860
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:58,110
<i>Let's get together and use those lips</i>

861
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:00,571
<i>Let's go</i>

862
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:03,490
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>

863
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:06,368
<i>A cake's no good</i>
<i>If you don't mix the batter</i>

864
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:08,704
<i>And bake it</i>

865
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,747
<i>And love's just a bubble</i>

866
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:13,667
<i>If you don't take the trouble</i>
<i>To make it</i>

867
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:17,546
<i>- So if you're free to go with me</i>
<i>- So if you're free to go with me</i>

868
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:20,048
<i>I'll take it quicker than one-two-three</i>

869
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:22,342
<i>Let's go</i>

870
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:25,137
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>

871
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:40,194
Don't do that.

872
01:12:40,986 --> 01:12:43,071
Hey, June.

873
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,211
June? Open up.

874
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:58,754
June, open the door.

875
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:01,924
Just leave me be, John, all right?

876
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:06,261
What? What, what did I do?

877
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:08,305
June, it's a song.

878
01:13:09,806 --> 01:13:12,768
Just please get away from me.

879
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:19,835
<i>I think I hear Johnny</i>
<i>Cash and the Tennessee Three.</i>

880
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:22,337
<i>They'll be playing all weekend long</i>
<i>at the Malco.</i>

881
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:23,881
<i>Matinees and evening shows...</i>

882
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:27,718
<i>... along with Jerry Lee Lewis,</i>
<i>June Carter and Carl Perkins.</i>

883
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,550
<i>It's the candyman</i>

884
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:11,345
<i>Well, all you ladies gather round</i>

885
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:13,180
<i>You know who's comin' to town</i>

886
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:14,723
<i>And it ain't Santa Claus</i>

887
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,225
<i>It's the candyman</i>

888
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:18,143
The candyman right there, Luther.

889
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:21,563
How come you don't never try
this brand of picking, Luther?

890
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:28,362
What you're looking for, Waylon,
I already found.

891
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:32,032
<i>The candyman is coming home</i>

892
01:15:32,824 --> 01:15:35,744
<i>Don't get stuck</i>
<i>On the candyman's stick</i>

893
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:39,873
Well, hey, June.

894
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,125
Hey, Jerry Lee.

895
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:47,798
How you doing, John?

896
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:52,845
Uh...

897
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:56,014
Well, okay, June. How you doing?

898
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:58,976
I surmise you've never been to bed.

899
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:01,979
- "Surmise."
We got a show at 2.

900
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:04,606
- A matinee. You remember?
We were just practicing.

901
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,276
- Sit down. It's slick here.
Practice makes perfect.

902
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:10,112
- Not today, Jerry Lee.
Why not?

903
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:12,364
- Because you're drunk.
Uh-oh.

904
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,243
Amen, brother.

905
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:19,121
Come on, Junie, just come
have a beer with us.

906
01:16:19,621 --> 01:16:21,665
I'm going home tonight
after the show.

907
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:24,084
I'm not here to look after y'all.

908
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:27,671
You're not?

909
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,303
You got somebody
to do that for you, John.

910
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:37,222
You got a wife somewhere.
You remember that?

911
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:38,432
Well, what if I didn't?

912
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,561
There's too many ifs in that sentence.

913
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,062
Only one, actually.

914
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:47,441
There's only one if
in that sentence, June.

915
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:49,776
Good point.

916
01:16:50,235 --> 01:16:53,238
I thought it was a good point.
I mean, there is only one.

917
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,032
- Really?
It's a good point.

918
01:16:59,828 --> 01:17:01,997
Hey.
- Don't talk to me like that.

919
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:04,625
We surrender. We surrender.

920
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,377
What was I thinking?
I must've been crazy.

921
01:17:08,045 --> 01:17:09,713
Y'all are gonna blow this tour.

922
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:12,382
You can't walk no line.

923
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:15,177
June, we ain't blowing the tour.

924
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:19,264
I am not gonna be that little Dutch boy
with my finger in the dam no more.

925
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:22,351
You're lying to yourself
if you think this is about a tour.

926
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:24,269
This isn't about a tour.

927
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:26,313
This isn't about a song.

928
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:46,917
<i>I keep a close watch</i>
<i>On this heart of mine</i>

929
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:51,463
<i>I keep my eyes wide open all the time</i>

930
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:55,717
<i>I keep the ends out</i>
<i>For the tie that binds</i>

931
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,219
I got his picture.

932
01:17:57,386 --> 01:18:00,889
<i>Because you're mine, I walk the line</i>

933
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:08,814
<i>As sure as night is dark</i>
<i>And day is light</i>

934
01:18:09,273 --> 01:18:13,151
<i>I keep you on my mind</i>
<i>Both day and night</i>

935
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:17,656
<i>And happiness I've known</i>
<i>Proves that it's right</i>

936
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:21,493
John. Honey, I wanna take
your picture. Roseanne, look at Mommy.

937
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:23,120
Say cheese.

938
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:29,835
<i>You've got a way</i>
<i>To keep me on your side</i>

939
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:34,339
<i>You give me cause for love</i>
<i>That I can't hide</i>

940
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:39,178
<i>For you I know</i>
<i>I'd even try to turn the tide</i>

941
01:18:39,344 --> 01:18:43,682
<i>Because you're mine, I walk the line</i>

942
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:46,185
What do you think of California?

943
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:48,353
We like it.
We just bought a house.

944
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:52,816
<i>I keep a close watch</i>
<i>On this heart of mine</i>

945
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:57,404
<i>I keep my eyes wide open all the time</i>

946
01:18:58,155 --> 01:19:02,409
<i>I keep the ends out</i>
<i>For the tie that binds</i>

947
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:06,914
<i>Because you're mine, I walk the line</i>

948
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:26,892
Lunchtime.

949
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:29,811
Come on in, everybody.

950
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:35,526
Hey, Kath? Roseanne?

951
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:38,278
Hey, girls, look up in the sky.

952
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:42,533
Hey, girls!
Hurry up, you can't miss it.

953
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:44,743
Hey. You see that bird up there?

954
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:50,374
You see that bird? That's a falcon.

955
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:51,667
Yeah.
Yeah.

956
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:54,127
Lunchtime.

957
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:55,671
Come on in, everybody.

958
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:58,215
This is the topic.
<i>All right, the answer is:</i>

959
01:19:58,382 --> 01:20:00,509
You ought to know that one.
You look at the funnies.

960
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,928
- Shmoos.
<i>What were the shmoos?</i>

961
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:05,389
<i>Correct. Go on and choose the next.</i>

962
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:07,349
<i>Let's go with...</i>

963
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:09,476
What is this?

964
01:20:09,643 --> 01:20:11,228
Hey, I've been looking for that.

965
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:13,897
That's the letter I wrote
to Bob Dylan on the plane.

966
01:20:14,064 --> 01:20:15,774
That folk singer I told you about.

967
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:18,652
You wrote it on an
airsickness bag, honey.

968
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:20,821
So what?

969
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:24,116
What's so funny?

970
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:27,828
I was thinking maybe
you ought to try sleeping at night.

971
01:20:28,078 --> 01:20:31,123
Maybe eating. Maybe both.

972
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:36,503
Hey, Viv, you made
your mind up about tonight?

973
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,715
You coming?

974
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:44,303
Well, okay. Because you're asking
so nice.

975
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,640
I got it. Got it.

976
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:54,354
Hello? Hey, Bob.

977
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:58,066
Hey, can you hold on a second?
One second.

978
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:11,580
Hello.

979
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:16,585
So, uh, you tell them awards people
that we're gonna come.

980
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:18,587
Uh-huh.

981
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:23,550
Hey, Bob. Do you know,
is June gonna be there?

982
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:28,180
This year we had a British
invasion, a beautiful girl from Brazil...

983
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:31,892
...a matchmaker from New York.
We even had a flying nanny.

984
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,895
- In 1964, we covered the globe.
Hey, Johnny.

985
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:36,396
Hey, Randy, how are you?

986
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:38,065
- With some incredible acts...

987
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:39,608
June? Hey.

988
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:41,109
Hi, John.

989
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:44,071
- Been a long time.
- Yeah.

990
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:46,657
- Hi, Vivian. How are you?
- Hello, June.

991
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:49,993
I saw you got married.

992
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,996
- Uh, yes, I did.
- Congratulations, June.

993
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:55,290
Thank you. I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

994
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,459
- So you think this one will stick?
John.

995
01:21:57,626 --> 01:21:59,336
Is this your third?
John.

996
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:01,797
I'm just asking a question.

997
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:03,757
Do not do this to me.

998
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:05,467
John.

999
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:16,562
- Hey, June, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you, John.

1000
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,647
Hey, excuse me, fella, do you mind?

1001
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:22,317
You don't look good, John.

1002
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:25,153
Well, you look real nice.

1003
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:27,531
So where's your truck driver?

1004
01:22:27,698 --> 01:22:29,575
Stock-car driver.

1005
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:32,244
You'll be happy to know
things aren't working out.

1006
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:34,705
It doesn't make me happy.

1007
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:38,083
Well, a little, it does.

1008
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:43,714
I wanna tour with you again, June.

1009
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,216
I miss the tour.

1010
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:47,968
I miss the music.

1011
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:50,846
I got two growing girls, John.
I can't tour.

1012
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:53,515
You're gonna do the comedy
act the rest of your life?

1013
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:55,976
You got a voice, June. Use it.

1014
01:22:56,185 --> 01:22:58,228
One week a month. That's all.

1015
01:22:58,395 --> 01:22:59,771
All right,
you'll work for me.

1016
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:03,483
You don't have to worry about bookings,
agents, publicists or anything.

1017
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:07,779
And if one of your girls get sick,
you stay home and I pay you anyways.

1018
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:07,905
And if one of your girls get sick,
you stay home and I pay you anyways.

1019
01:23:12,075 --> 01:23:18,415
<i>Oh, he taught me to love him</i>
<i>And promised to love</i>

1020
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:26,089
<i>And to cherish me over</i>
<i>All others above</i>

1021
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:34,223
<i>How my heart is now wondering</i>
<i>No misery can tell</i>

1022
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:40,354
<i>He's left me no warning</i>
<i>No words of farewell</i>

1023
01:23:41,855 --> 01:23:48,737
<i>Oh, he taught me to love him</i>
<i>And called me his flower</i>

1024
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:56,453
<i>That was blooming to cheer him</i>
<i>Through life's dreary hour</i>

1025
01:23:57,496 --> 01:24:04,002
<i>How I long to see him</i>
<i>And regret the dark hour</i>

1026
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:11,301
<i>He's gone and neglected</i>
<i>This pale wildwood flower</i>

1027
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:30,737
Thank you. That's my
mama's favorite song.

1028
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:35,534
So y'all sit down, squat down or lie
down, but make yourselves at home...

1029
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:37,494
...because here's the one and only...

1030
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:40,414
...Mr. Johnny Cash.

1031
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:52,885
Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.

1032
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:09,693
<i>Go away from my window</i>

1033
01:25:10,569 --> 01:25:14,031

<i>Someone to close his eyes to you</i>

Great show.
- Thank you.

1055
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,673
We loved it.
- It's all June. It's all June.

1056
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,884
- Brilliant, John.
Thank you.

1057
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:59,970
Hi, good to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

1058
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:01,346
- Hello.
What's next?

1059
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:03,098
- We're booked in Vegas.
June?

1060
01:27:03,307 --> 01:27:06,393
Yeah?
- I want you to meet my parents.

1061
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,562
- That's my mama and my daddy.
- Hi.

1062
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:11,273
How you doing?
- It's so nice to meet you finally.

1063
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,691
Hi, I'm June Carter.

1064
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,568
- Miss Carter.
- Nice to meet you.

1065
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:17,779
You haven't met my little girls,
have you? This is Roseanne...

1066
01:27:17,988 --> 01:27:21,116
Oh, they were sleeping with...
Ain't they sweet?

1067
01:27:21,325 --> 01:27:24,244
You girls are all dressed alike.
I love those yellow ribbons.

1068
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:26,622
June.
- Yeah?

1069
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:28,373
Stay clear of my children.

1070
01:27:28,582 --> 01:27:30,876
Vivian, I was just saying hello.
- You heard me.

1071
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:32,586
Viv.

1072
01:27:33,337 --> 01:27:34,713
- Vivian, please.
- No.

<i>But ifthey'll laugh at you in Jackson</i>

1079
01:27:57,778 --> 01:28:00,614
<i>And I'll be waiting in Jackson</i>

1080

Oh, wait, catch it.
Come on, y'all.

1090
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:39,945
I got this beef jerky.
You're gonna love it, man.

1091
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:43,198
Nice boots.
High rollers out there?

1092
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:55,210
Say, officer, how do you get
your shirts to stay that way...

1093
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:57,713
...so stiff?

1094
01:28:58,714 --> 01:29:00,716
Just starch.

1095
01:29:02,885 --> 01:29:05,929
Huh. It's real nice.

1096
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:10,184
What?

1097
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:13,353
- What?
- Are you out of your rabbit-assed mind?

1098
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:18,025
All right, good night.
- Good night, y'all.

1099
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:20,194
- Good night.
Give me two, give me two.

1100
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:27,409
- That was a fun show tonight.
- Yeah, it was.

1101
01:29:27,576 --> 01:29:29,453
- This is my room.
- Right.

1102
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:33,415
Hey, you wanna have
one of these with me?

1103
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,834
Uh...

1104
01:29:37,377 --> 01:29:39,171
I don't know.

1105
01:30:07,824 --> 01:30:09,576
Can I have one?

1106
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:22,798
- John.
- All right.

1107
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:24,466
Wait, wait, here.

1108
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:26,844
I'll get a good one.

1109
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:39,147
You know what? You're just mean.

1110
01:30:39,314 --> 01:30:40,941
That's what you are, you're mean.

1111
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:42,860
Here, here.
- You're a mean man.

1112
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:44,611
Don't say that.
- And I knew it.

1113
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:46,780
I've known it all along.

1114
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:49,783
Wait a minute. Here.

1115
01:30:53,871 --> 01:30:56,540
- Come on. Open your mouth.
- No.

1116
01:30:56,707 --> 01:30:58,458
I don't trust you.

1117
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:01,086
- Don't say that.
- I don't trust you.

1118
01:31:01,253 --> 01:31:03,505
Yes, you do.

1119
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:09,469
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

1120
01:31:13,932 --> 01:31:16,059
You're so evil. Terrible.

1121
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:21,106
Oh...

1122
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,694
I suppose I better answer it.

1123
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,658
Hello?

1124
01:31:32,993 --> 01:31:35,954
Oh, hey, Carlene, what's wrong?

1125
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:41,543
Okay, sweetie, I can't understand what
you're saying, you're crying so hard.

1126
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:45,339
I know, but you gotta
calm down, honey.

1127
01:31:48,634 --> 01:31:52,012
All right. But everything's okay?

1128
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,099
Yeah, I know, sweetie,
sometimes that happens.

1129
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:58,769
Sweetie, little sisters do
stuff like that sometimes.

1130
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:01,522
You gotta learn
to be patient with her.

1131
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:15,577
Um, okay, well, um...

1132
01:32:16,787 --> 01:32:20,040
...tell Linda that Mommy said you can
have pancakes on Saturdays.

1133
01:32:20,249 --> 01:32:22,584
- Hey, June, I'm gonna go to my room.
- All right?

1134
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:26,713
Yeah, I know, sweetie.
I'm gonna come home soon.

1135
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:28,507
<i>Yeah, sweetie, please don't cry.</i>

1136
01:32:31,343 --> 01:32:34,179
<i>Front desk.</i>
- Hi, could I have June Carter's room?

1137
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:36,974
<i>Certainly. One moment, sir.</i>

1138
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,449
June.

1139
01:32:57,286 --> 01:32:59,162
It's not wrong, June.

1140
01:32:59,329 --> 01:33:01,248
This ain't wrong.

1141
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:03,834
June.

1142
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:08,505
I'm not gonna do this, John.
I'm not gonna do this.

1143
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:33,155
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1144
01:33:34,615 --> 01:33:36,867
Where's Johnny?
Johnny.

1145
01:33:37,034 --> 01:33:39,203
Well, Johnny Cash'll be
out in just a minute.

1146
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:41,205
He's been detained for just a minute.

1147
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:43,874
But we're gonna keep
you entertained till then.

1148
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,709
And we're gonna play a wonderful...

1149
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:47,836
Hold on, hold on. Johnny's here.

1150
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:49,379
Yeah.

1151
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:53,217
Here he is, Mr. Johnny Cash.

1152
01:33:54,218 --> 01:33:55,969
Hi, folks, I'm Johnny Cash.

1153
01:33:56,136 --> 01:33:59,348
What about that June Carter,
ain't she a sweetheart?

1154
01:33:59,556 --> 01:34:02,643
"I Got Stripes."
"I Got Stripes."

1155
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:27,042
<i>On a Monday, I was arrested</i>

1156
01:34:27,626 --> 01:34:30,963
<i>On a Tuesday, they locked me in jail</i>

1157
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,676
<i>On a Wednesday, my trial was attested</i>

1158
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:40,055
<i>And on a Thursday, they said, "Guilty"</i>
<i>And the judge's gavel fell</i>

1159
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:44,393
<i>I got stripes</i>
<i>Stripes around my shoulders</i>

1160
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,564
<i>I got chains</i>
<i>Chains around my feet</i>

1161
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:53,026
<i>I got stripes</i>
<i>Stripes around my shoulders</i>

1162
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:55,237
<i>And them chains</i>
<i>Them chains</i>

1163
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:57,823
<i>They're about to drag me down</i>

1164
01:35:02,035 --> 01:35:05,622
Get it on, man.
Play the fucking thing.

1165
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:09,001
<i>I got my... just got our britches</i>

1166
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:13,297
<i>On a Tuesday, I got my ball and chain</i>

1167
01:35:13,463 --> 01:35:16,133
<i>On a Wednesday, my trial</i>

1168
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:22,139
<i>On a Thurs...</i>
<i>They had to knock me down</i>

1169
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:23,724
<i>I got stripes</i>

1170
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:31,106
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1171
01:35:34,443 --> 01:35:36,486
Oh, my God. John.

1172
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:39,865
- Close the curtain. John. John.
Get a doctor.

1173
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:41,408
Put the curtain back.

1174
01:35:41,617 --> 01:35:43,202
Come on, pull him back.

1175
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:45,704
J.R., you okay?
- Yeah.

1176
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:49,041
J.R., look at me.
John.

1177
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:55,172
"Fortunately, I was keeping my feathers
numbered for just such an emergency."

1178
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:00,636
Let's get some help.
- Junie? June?

1179
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:03,430
Come on, get him some help.

1180
01:36:21,031 --> 01:36:23,325
- Yeah?
J. R?

1181
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:25,410
What?

1182
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:29,498
J.R.

1183
01:36:34,711 --> 01:36:36,672
The tour's been canceled, John.

1184
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:39,842
Who says?

1185
01:36:40,968 --> 01:36:44,721
We got you a ticket home, John.
Tomorrow.

1186
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:46,557
You see where I'm putting it?

1187
01:36:47,808 --> 01:36:49,309
Right here by the phone.

1188
01:36:55,732 --> 01:36:57,693
Take care of yourself, John.

1189
01:37:14,126 --> 01:37:16,253
You're burning up.

1190
01:37:18,881 --> 01:37:22,259
Got hotter places than my forehead.

1191
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:28,390
Tell me you don't love me.

1192
01:37:32,269 --> 01:37:34,438
I don't love you.

1193
01:37:35,856 --> 01:37:37,941
You're a liar.

1194
01:37:38,567 --> 01:37:41,904
Well, then I guess you ain't
got no problems, do you?

1195
01:37:52,497 --> 01:37:54,499
- Where are my pills?
- Flushed them all.

1196
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:56,877
June... Junie, don't say that.

1197
01:37:58,045 --> 01:38:00,881
Now, hold on. I... I... I need those.

1198
01:38:01,048 --> 01:38:05,677
I need those pills. Listen, that's just,
baby... Those are my prescriptions.

1199
01:38:05,844 --> 01:38:10,057
From the doctor. Okay?
I need... I need those.

1200
01:38:19,149 --> 01:38:21,276
Now, I know... I...

1201
01:38:46,134 --> 01:38:48,262
It burns...

1202
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:51,348
...burns, burns.

1203
01:38:55,644 --> 01:38:57,938
Mommy.

1204
01:38:58,105 --> 01:39:00,274
Mommy.

1205
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:12,244
Few more minutes, pal.

1206
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,252
There you go.

1207
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:32,806
<i>The taste of love is sweet</i>

1208
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:42,274
<i>And it burns, burns, burns, burns</i>

1209
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:53,452
<i>Then it burns, burns, burns, burns</i>

1210
01:39:53,619 --> 01:39:57,080
<i>The ring of fire</i>

1211
01:39:58,874 --> 01:40:01,376
<i>The ring of fire</i>

1212
01:40:09,092 --> 01:40:13,847
Now boarding,
<i>flight 1919. Service to San Jose.</i>

1213
01:40:14,014 --> 01:40:17,100
<i>At this time, we'd like</i>
<i>to see a boarding pass.</i>

1214
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:25,609
<i>Final boarding call for flight 57.</i>
<i>Now boarding at gate 7.</i>

1215
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:33,825
Mr. Cash.

1216
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,257
You wanna take these strings off,
or do you want us to break it?

1217
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:18,161
There he is.

1218
01:41:24,418 --> 01:41:26,587
What kind of trouble is there?

1219
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:29,339
- Your career, Mr. Cash?

1220
01:41:29,506 --> 01:41:31,758
Right this way.
Mr. Cash?

1221
01:41:33,468 --> 01:41:35,470
Right here.
Come on, John.

1222
01:42:02,664 --> 01:42:07,002
Your mama was here. Your daddy too.

1223
01:42:07,586 --> 01:42:09,588
What'd he say?

1224
01:42:09,922 --> 01:42:11,924
Said now you won't have to work
so hard...

1225
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:14,468
...to make people think
you've been to jail.

1226
01:42:25,938 --> 01:42:28,690
- Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

1227
01:42:28,857 --> 01:42:30,651
You okay?

1228
01:42:31,985 --> 01:42:35,531
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1229
01:42:37,241 --> 01:42:38,867
I'll see you in the morning.

1230
01:43:03,892 --> 01:43:06,520
Cindy doesn't like mustard.

1231
01:43:12,651 --> 01:43:15,654
The pills were legal, Viv.
You know, I got prescriptions.

1232
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:18,991
You're not supposed to buy them
across the border, that's all.

1233
01:43:19,157 --> 01:43:22,369
Other than that, it's fine.

1234
01:43:22,536 --> 01:43:25,831
- So the radio's lying?
- Yeah.

1235
01:43:25,998 --> 01:43:28,876
- The TV's lying.
- Baby, they'll say anything.

1236
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:32,212
Your lawyer's lying. Luther's lying.

1237
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:36,175
- Marshall's lying. Your manager.
- Viv, I don't wanna fight.

1238
01:43:37,759 --> 01:43:40,053
What about June?

1239
01:43:40,804 --> 01:43:43,682
Does she think it's fine her
new boy's a drug addict?

1240
01:43:43,849 --> 01:43:47,644
She left the tour, Viv. In Vegas.

1241
01:43:50,063 --> 01:43:52,816
Well, that explains everything,
doesn't it?

1242
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:07,497
<i>God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"</i>

1243
01:44:07,664 --> 01:44:10,959
<i>- Abe said, "You must be puttin' me on"</i>
- John.

1244
01:44:11,126 --> 01:44:14,087
<i>God say, "No"</i>
<i>Abe say, "What?"</i>

1245
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:17,007
<i>God say, "You can do</i>
<i>What you want, Abe</i>

1246
01:44:17,174 --> 01:44:21,053
<i>But the next time you see me comin'</i>
<i>You better run"</i>

1247
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:27,351
John, what are you doing?

1248
01:44:27,518 --> 01:44:29,728
It's 7 a.m.

1249
01:44:31,271 --> 01:44:33,732
The kids are getting ready for school.

1250
01:44:34,566 --> 01:44:36,860
Just hanging pictures.

1251
01:44:46,203 --> 01:44:48,622
John, please don't hang these.

1252
01:44:48,914 --> 01:44:52,000
Viv, they're pictures of my band.

1253
01:44:52,543 --> 01:44:55,003
Don't hang these.

1254
01:44:56,964 --> 01:44:59,132
- No, don't hang these.
- Let go of the picture.

1255
01:44:59,341 --> 01:45:02,636
- I said, please don't hang these, John.
- Viv.

1256
01:45:02,803 --> 01:45:04,429
No.

1257
01:45:04,638 --> 01:45:07,891
Viv, get back here. Viv.

1258
01:45:08,058 --> 01:45:10,227
Viv, get back here.

1259
01:45:10,769 --> 01:45:14,481
- Viv, I ain't kidding.
- No.

1260
01:45:19,027 --> 01:45:22,072
Vivian, give me the damn picture.

1261
01:45:23,115 --> 01:45:27,828
- Viv, give me the pic...
- No.

1262
01:45:28,036 --> 01:45:32,416
Hey, Viv, wa... Don't do that.

1263
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:37,629
- Now, stop it. Baby, stop it. All right...
- You. You pathetic excuse for a man.

1264
01:45:37,838 --> 01:45:40,507
She will find out, you liar.
She'll find out.

1265
01:45:41,133 --> 01:45:43,385
She'll find out, John.

1266
01:45:43,552 --> 01:45:45,637
- You liar.
- Stop it.

1267
01:45:45,804 --> 01:45:47,472
- No.
- You think you're perfect?

1268
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:52,019
- You think you're perfect? Huh? Huh?
- No. No.

1269
01:45:55,898 --> 01:45:57,441
No.

1270
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,363
No.

1271
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:05,824
No.

1272
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:07,910
No.

1273
01:46:17,211 --> 01:46:18,462
I'm coming.

1274
01:46:22,424 --> 01:46:25,052
Shut the door...

1275
01:46:35,521 --> 01:46:39,775
Hey, you leave them out of this.
Viv. You leave them out of this.

1276
01:46:39,942 --> 01:46:43,070
Girls. Girls. No.

1277
01:46:44,154 --> 01:46:45,948
Girls.

1278
01:46:59,545 --> 01:47:06,176
<i>I'm a long way from home</i>

1279
01:47:07,511 --> 01:47:11,640
<i>And so all alone</i>

1280
01:47:12,182 --> 01:47:17,521
<i>Homesick like I never thought I'd be</i>

1281
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:26,363
<i>I'm a long way from home</i>

1282
01:47:27,739 --> 01:47:31,577
<i>Everything is wrong</i>

1283
01:47:32,244 --> 01:47:37,749
<i>Someone please watch over me</i>

1284
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:49,928
Thirty hours.

1285
01:47:57,019 --> 01:47:59,980
You've been asleep for 30 hours, hoss.

1286
01:48:00,606 --> 01:48:02,649
Hey, did June call?

1287
01:48:04,318 --> 01:48:07,696
Woman won't return my damn calls.

1288
01:48:14,328 --> 01:48:17,164
They disconnected it yesterday.

1289
01:48:17,372 --> 01:48:19,750
Insufficient "fundilation."

1290
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:22,920
Now, come on, man.
I gave you money for that.

1291
01:48:23,086 --> 01:48:25,714
Well, that was last month.
This is this month.

1292
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:34,223
You see, I'm a little
behind right now...

1293
01:48:34,389 --> 01:48:37,768
...and I need this to
turn my phone back on.

1294
01:48:37,935 --> 01:48:39,895
Because I need to talk to my woman.

1295
01:48:40,062 --> 01:48:44,191
You see, I'm in love with a woman and I
need to talk to her, you understand?

1296
01:48:44,358 --> 01:48:47,194
I need this to get my
car out of the shop.

1297
01:48:47,361 --> 01:48:49,988
And she lives way,
way out on the edge of town.

1298
01:48:50,155 --> 01:48:52,616
It's the Bataan Death March
to get there, you see?

1299
01:48:52,783 --> 01:48:56,537
So if you'll just go ahead
and cash this.

1300
01:48:56,703 --> 01:48:58,705
I'm sorry, Mr. Cash.

1301
01:48:58,872 --> 01:49:01,375
- You know who I am.
- Yes, sir.

1302
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:04,878
Okay, then just please
cash my check for me.

1303
01:49:05,045 --> 01:49:09,049
The bank puts an automatic
hold on checks like this.

1304
01:49:09,383 --> 01:49:11,718
It's a large amount.

1305
01:49:12,302 --> 01:49:15,013
If you can't cash it,
then it's just a piece of paper.

1306
01:49:15,222 --> 01:49:17,766
- Oh, don't do that. Please...
- Why? You can't cash it.

1307
01:49:17,933 --> 01:49:20,727
It ain't nothing.
Just a damn piece of paper.

1308
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:33,490
Mama, Johnny Cash is here.

1309
01:49:36,493 --> 01:49:38,453
Hey, girls.

1310
01:49:39,329 --> 01:49:43,250
- Hey, Carlene, you look real nice.
- Hey, Johnny.

1311
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:46,587
- Mama, Johnny Cash is here.
- Hi, Mother Maybelle.

1312
01:49:47,212 --> 01:49:49,089
Hey, John.

1313
01:49:49,256 --> 01:49:50,591
How are you doing?

1314
01:49:50,799 --> 01:49:52,718
Doing all right.

1315
01:49:53,969 --> 01:49:55,470
Hi, June.

1316
01:49:56,221 --> 01:49:57,556
Hi, John.

1317
01:49:57,723 --> 01:50:01,351
Hey, girls can you go inside the
living room and clean up that mess?

1318
01:50:01,518 --> 01:50:03,687
All right, honey.
- I tried to call, June...

1319
01:50:03,854 --> 01:50:06,315
...but I think there's something
wrong with your phone.

1320
01:50:06,481 --> 01:50:08,066
Look at you.

1321
01:50:08,233 --> 01:50:10,277
Have you looked in a mirror lately?

1322
01:50:10,652 --> 01:50:13,155
How are you gonna sing
when you can't even talk?

1323
01:50:13,322 --> 01:50:17,284
"I got the laryngitis." Remember?

1324
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:21,538
- Marry me, June.
- Oh, please. Get up off your knees.

1325
01:50:21,705 --> 01:50:23,874
You look pathetic. Come on.

1326
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:26,376
I don't want my girls
seeing somebody like this.

1327
01:50:26,543 --> 01:50:29,630
- Come on, baby.
- Where's my friend John?

1328
01:50:30,255 --> 01:50:33,967
What'd he get, high? Or is he incognito?
Is he gone?

1329
01:50:34,134 --> 01:50:36,136
Because I don't like this guy Cash.

1330
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:39,473
I ain't incognito.

1331
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:42,309
I'm right here. You see?

1332
01:50:42,476 --> 01:50:45,479
- I'm here.
- Fine. Where's your car?

1333
01:50:45,896 --> 01:50:47,731
It's in make up.

1334
01:50:47,898 --> 01:50:50,859
- You walked here?
- Yeah.

1335
01:50:51,026 --> 01:50:53,237
You walked here all the
way from Nashville?

1336
01:50:53,403 --> 01:50:57,199
Yeah, well, walking's good for you.
See, I'm trying to get in shape, June.

1337
01:50:57,407 --> 01:51:01,328
It cleans out your system.
Well, it's a spiritual thing.

1338
01:51:01,495 --> 01:51:03,872
I'm on a love walk.

1339
01:51:04,039 --> 01:51:07,918
- The June Carter love walk. Immemorial.
- You know what?

1340
01:51:08,085 --> 01:51:10,420
I am supporting more than
myself right now.

1341
01:51:10,587 --> 01:51:12,631
Please do not blow another tour.

1342
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:15,175
Oh, June, love's more
important than a tour.

1343
01:51:15,342 --> 01:51:16,885
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

1344
01:51:17,052 --> 01:51:21,098
Well, then start loving yourself.
So we can go back to work.

1345
01:51:21,932 --> 01:51:23,725
All right, June.

1346
01:51:23,892 --> 01:51:26,562
Hey, you keep your phone on,
and I will too.

1347
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:28,730
I'll call.

1348
01:51:30,774 --> 01:51:32,818
I'll call you.

1349
01:51:34,027 --> 01:51:36,196
When you're feeling better, I'll call.

1350
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:47,791
Oh. Oh, come on.

1351
01:51:49,626 --> 01:51:52,421
Listen, you know,
times like this, I say to myself...

1352
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:55,674
...I say, "Jack, what would
the baby Jesus do?"

1353
01:52:00,304 --> 01:52:03,098
- That's your name? Jack?
- Mm-hm. Jack.

1354
01:52:04,516 --> 01:52:06,894
Shit, I need another drink.

1355
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:11,857
Ahh. I am lit up of the spirit.
Yes, sir, Jack needs another drink.

1356
01:52:28,874 --> 01:52:34,796
<i>June Carter, June Carter</i>
<i>Would you give me some time?</i>

1357
01:52:34,963 --> 01:52:41,178
<i>How much longer will it be till</i>
<i>Till I can call you mine?</i>

1358
01:52:41,345 --> 01:52:47,893
<i>When you see Johnny, would you tell him</i>
<i>That you're gonna stick around?</i>

1359
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:51,438
<i>And then Johnny will buy you</i>

1360
01:52:52,272 --> 01:52:55,526
<i>A nice white gown</i>

1361
01:53:52,624 --> 01:53:54,960
Hey, that's a beautiful house.

1362
01:54:07,806 --> 01:54:09,600
Hey, man.

1363
01:54:11,476 --> 01:54:12,895
Beautiful place, man.

1364
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:14,438
- Yeah? Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

1365
01:54:24,907 --> 01:54:26,742
Hello?
- June?

1366
01:54:26,909 --> 01:54:29,536
- Hey, it's John.
<i>- Hi.</i>

1367
01:54:29,703 --> 01:54:32,414
Hey. How you doing?

1368
01:54:32,581 --> 01:54:35,792
<i>I'm fine, John. How are you?</i>

1369
01:54:35,959 --> 01:54:39,338
Uh, doing a lot better than
last time you saw me.

1370
01:54:39,505 --> 01:54:41,840
<i>Well, that's good.</i>
<i>I'm glad to hear that.</i>

1371
01:54:42,007 --> 01:54:45,010
<i>- You still taking those pills?</i>
- No.

1372
01:54:45,177 --> 01:54:48,805
That was, you know... That was
a rough patch there, June.

1373
01:54:48,972 --> 01:54:52,059
I just needed to,
you know, get some time.

1374
01:54:52,226 --> 01:54:54,102
I'm doing better,
though, now, you know?

1375
01:54:54,269 --> 01:54:56,438
I got out of that apartment...

1376
01:54:56,605 --> 01:55:00,150
...and got this place out
in Hendersonville on a lake. Big spread.

1377
01:55:00,317 --> 01:55:03,612
<i>- I heard that.</i>
- Yeah, I'm...

1378
01:55:04,196 --> 01:55:07,199
...trying to get things together.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

1379
01:55:08,825 --> 01:55:11,578
<i>Are you alone on Thanksgiving, John?</i>

1380
01:55:12,663 --> 01:55:16,166
Yeah... My folks are coming
down with Reba and Roseanne...

1381
01:55:16,333 --> 01:55:20,796
...and I got this big bird, but I don't
know when to put it in the oven...

1382
01:55:20,963 --> 01:55:23,423
...or really what
temperature to set it at or...

1383
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:24,883
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1384
01:55:28,095 --> 01:55:30,013
It is beautiful.
Really lucky.

1385
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:33,350
I'm really proud of you.
- You see? It goes from right up there...

1386
01:55:33,517 --> 01:55:36,353
...clear across halfway around the lake.
- Yeah.

1387
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:39,523
What's going on down
there with that tractor?

1388
01:55:41,191 --> 01:55:44,987
Uh, I got it stuck. I was trying to pull
this stump, and I come up...

1389
01:55:45,153 --> 01:55:47,114
Doing something dangerous.
- Yeah, but...

1390
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:49,950
That's a fine piece of equipment to
leave in that mud.

1391
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:53,078
Is that the way you take care
of your things?

1392
01:55:58,333 --> 01:55:59,376
Hey.

1393
01:56:00,252 --> 01:56:01,461
Thanksgiving, okay?

1394
01:56:01,628 --> 01:56:03,213
Look at this.
Hey.

1395
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:05,007
Hey.
Happy Thanksgiving.

1396
01:56:05,174 --> 01:56:06,758
Here, Carlene.

1397
01:56:06,925 --> 01:56:08,594
- Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey, John.

1398
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,304
Hi.
- I like this place here.

1399
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:13,182
Oh, thanks. Hey, Rosie.
Happy Thanksgiving.

1400
01:56:13,348 --> 01:56:14,683
Thank you.
- Hey.

1401
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:17,352
Let's go and meet John's...
- House is beautiful.

1402
01:56:17,519 --> 01:56:20,230
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

1403
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:23,692
- John, how you doing?
Let me help you.

1404
01:56:23,942 --> 01:56:26,945
- That's my mama, Carrie.
- Maybelle Carter, Happy Thanksgiving.

1405
01:56:27,112 --> 01:56:29,072
- This is my daddy, Ray.
- How you doing?

1406
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:31,366
- Good to meet you.
- My mama, Carrie.

1407
01:56:31,533 --> 01:56:33,952
- How do you do?
- Carrie was gonna cook for y'all...

1408
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:36,788
...but J.R., he doesn't have
a pot or a pan, so...

1409
01:56:36,997 --> 01:56:38,582
We're happy to share our food.

1410
01:56:38,749 --> 01:56:40,459
I just moved in, you know.

1411
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:42,002
Thanks.
- Come inside.

1412
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:44,963
If you gonna get out on big
water like lakes or a river...

1413
01:56:45,172 --> 01:56:48,133
...you're gonna need something
you can cast out pretty good.

1414
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:50,511
If you haven't got one,
I'm gonna tell you...

1415
01:56:50,677 --> 01:56:52,596
...you need to get you a Zebco 33.

1416
01:56:52,763 --> 01:56:55,265
That's about the best
reels you can get.

1417
01:56:55,432 --> 01:56:58,769
Don't tangle up much, and you can cast
them about as far as you want.

1418
01:56:58,936 --> 01:57:03,148
There in them little farm ponds, you
don't need nothing but a cane pole...

1419
01:57:03,357 --> 01:57:07,027
...and a float and maybe some crickets
or worms, if you can dig them up.

1420
01:57:07,194 --> 01:57:08,403
That's all we ever had.

1421
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:12,533
The Zebco 33 is probably your best bet.
I bought June one when she was 12.

1422
01:57:12,699 --> 01:57:15,244
- Remember that?
- That's right. I caught a lot of fish.

1423
01:57:15,452 --> 01:57:16,912
You sure did.

1424
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,374
So, what do you think, Daddy?

1425
01:57:21,083 --> 01:57:22,876
About what?

1426
01:57:25,754 --> 01:57:28,006
About the house.

1427
01:57:33,262 --> 01:57:35,597
It's a fine big house, John.

1428
01:57:35,806 --> 01:57:38,892
- Thanks.
- It's not as big as Jack Benny's.

1429
01:57:39,059 --> 01:57:41,520
What, you been to Jack Benny's, Ray?

1430
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:44,439
Saw it on the TV.

1431
01:57:44,648 --> 01:57:49,069
Carrie, I was meaning to ask you,
did you teach the boys to play?

1432
01:57:49,236 --> 01:57:53,574
Well, J.R. Always sang pretty, but I
don't think I could take credit for it.

1433
01:57:54,032 --> 01:57:56,785
I'll bet you did. I bet you
learned the same way I did.

1434
01:57:56,994 --> 01:58:00,622
Oh, out of the hymnals, sure.
I knew you'd say that.

1435
01:58:00,789 --> 01:58:04,710
You know, you'd be surprised how many
musicians can't read shape notes.

1436
01:58:04,877 --> 01:58:06,628
I can't imagine.
I know.

1437
01:58:06,795 --> 01:58:10,716
But my husband's uncle, E.M. Bayes,
he taught me with hymnals too.

1438
01:58:10,924 --> 01:58:14,428
Well, how about you, John?
You know how to read shape notes?

1439
01:58:16,597 --> 01:58:18,390
John.

1440
01:58:18,932 --> 01:58:20,642
Mama asked you a question, John.

1441
01:58:20,809 --> 01:58:24,354
I'm really glad y'all
could be here today.

1442
01:58:24,771 --> 01:58:26,815
Especially you, Daddy.

1443
01:58:26,982 --> 01:58:28,901
Glad he came...

1444
01:58:29,067 --> 01:58:32,196
...to dinner,
and Thanksgiving, and all.

1445
01:58:36,533 --> 01:58:39,244
Not everybody's here.

1446
01:58:43,332 --> 01:58:45,918
Jack's not here, is he?

1447
01:58:47,586 --> 01:58:48,962
Huh?

1448
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,925
"Where you been?"

1449
01:58:56,970 --> 01:59:00,140
That's what you said to me.
Remember?

1450
01:59:04,811 --> 01:59:07,189
And I was 12 years old...

1451
01:59:08,649 --> 01:59:11,944
...youse got Jack's bloody clothes...

1452
01:59:13,195 --> 01:59:15,739
...and you says to me,
"Where you been?"

1453
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:18,992
Well...

1454
01:59:19,785 --> 01:59:21,495
...where were you?

1455
01:59:22,871 --> 01:59:24,873
Where were you?

1456
01:59:30,504 --> 01:59:33,841
I quit drinking a long time ago, J.R.

1457
01:59:34,007 --> 01:59:36,844
What about you?
You still taking them pills?

1458
01:59:38,011 --> 01:59:42,641
- That'll kill you, you know.
- Yeah, well, so will a car wreck.

1459
01:59:44,685 --> 01:59:47,688
You're sitting on a high horse, boy.

1460
01:59:48,564 --> 01:59:51,650
I never had talent. I did the
best I could with what I had.

1461
01:59:51,817 --> 01:59:53,861
Can you say that?

1462
01:59:54,027 --> 01:59:56,530
Mister Big Shot?
Mister Pill-Popping Rock Star?

1463
01:59:56,738 --> 01:59:59,157
- Ray.
Who are you to judge?

1464
01:59:59,366 --> 02:00:03,453
You ain't got nothing.
Big empty house. Nothing.

1465
02:00:03,662 --> 02:00:06,915
Children you don't see. Nothing.

1466
02:00:07,082 --> 02:00:10,502
Big old expensive tractor
stuck in the mud.

1467
02:00:11,086 --> 02:00:12,963
Nothing.

1468
02:00:35,444 --> 02:00:37,362
Come on.

1469
02:00:38,572 --> 02:00:42,409
Let's do it. Come on.

1470
02:00:42,618 --> 02:00:46,330
You is a son of a bitch, ain't you?
Come on.

1471
02:00:48,415 --> 02:00:49,833
Do it, do it.

1472
02:00:50,584 --> 02:00:52,294
Come on.

1473
02:00:54,213 --> 02:00:56,131
Come on.

1474
02:01:00,636 --> 02:01:02,554
I'm gonna sit in the middle this time.

1475
02:01:02,721 --> 02:01:05,307
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1476
02:01:06,433 --> 02:01:08,936
- John?
A fine piece of equipment, huh?

1477
02:01:09,102 --> 02:01:12,689
- John.
Come on.

1478
02:01:14,358 --> 02:01:16,944
You should go down to him.
Mama.

1479
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:19,613
- He's mixed up.
- I am not going down there.

1480
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:23,617
- If I go down there...
- You already are down there, honey.

1481
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:33,252
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1482
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,716
John.

1483
02:01:40,175 --> 02:01:41,343
John.

1484
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:44,388
John.

1485
02:01:44,763 --> 02:01:47,599
John. John.

1486
02:01:48,267 --> 02:01:50,018
- John.
- Aah!

1487
02:01:50,853 --> 02:01:54,147
John. John.

1488
02:02:02,072 --> 02:02:04,658
- June?
Come on.

1489
02:02:16,461 --> 02:02:19,339
You should have left me.

1490
02:03:54,726 --> 02:03:56,645
John?

1491
02:03:57,396 --> 02:03:59,857
<i>Go on ahead, J.R.</i>

1492
02:04:00,065 --> 02:04:01,483
<i>You know what that is?</i>

1493
02:04:02,734 --> 02:04:05,362
<i>Just please get away from me.</i>

1494
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:07,155
<i>Daddy?</i>

1495
02:04:07,364 --> 02:04:08,949
John?

1496
02:04:10,284 --> 02:04:12,119
Hey, John?

1497
02:04:12,369 --> 02:04:16,331
Oh, shit. Jesus. Hey...
What...? Hey, John?

1498
02:04:16,498 --> 02:04:18,667
Get your ass out of here, boy.
- Hey, John.

1499
02:04:18,876 --> 02:04:21,003
Get out.
Take your poison with you.

1500
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:23,380
Okay. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

1501
02:04:42,441 --> 02:04:44,276
Hey.

1502
02:04:47,446 --> 02:04:50,449
Mom and I picked
these up down the road.

1503
02:04:50,616 --> 02:04:52,326
They're good.

1504
02:05:15,724 --> 02:05:18,393
It's good to see you again.

1505
02:05:19,686 --> 02:05:21,480
Can I get you something else?

1506
02:05:21,647 --> 02:05:23,774
Just stay.

1507
02:05:24,858 --> 02:05:26,693
Okay.

1508
02:05:29,863 --> 02:05:32,449
You're an angel.

1509
02:05:34,409 --> 02:05:36,078
No, I'm not.

1510
02:05:36,578 --> 02:05:39,081
You've been here with me.

1511
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:43,001
I had a friend who needed help.

1512
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:45,337
You're my friend.

1513
02:05:47,589 --> 02:05:51,051
But I done so many bad things.

1514
02:05:51,218 --> 02:05:54,388
You done a few. That's true.

1515
02:05:58,475 --> 02:06:01,144
My daddy's right.

1516
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:05,691
Should have been me on that saw.

1517
02:06:12,197 --> 02:06:15,117
Jack was so good.

1518
02:06:15,784 --> 02:06:19,079
He would have done
so many good things.

1519
02:06:19,246 --> 02:06:21,832
What have I done?

1520
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:26,461
Just hurt everybody I know.

1521
02:06:30,716 --> 02:06:33,385
I know I've hurt you.

1522
02:06:39,308 --> 02:06:41,518
I'm nothing.

1523
02:06:44,313 --> 02:06:46,815
You're not nothing.

1524
02:06:49,276 --> 02:06:51,695
You are not nothing.

1525
02:06:52,988 --> 02:06:55,199
You're a good man.

1526
02:06:56,575 --> 02:07:00,913
And God has given you a second
chance to make things right, John.

1527
02:07:02,331 --> 02:07:05,125
This is your chance, honey.

1528
02:07:08,003 --> 02:07:10,714
This is your chance.

1529
02:07:29,858 --> 02:07:32,069
Hi, how are y'all?

1530
02:07:36,114 --> 02:07:38,033
Could you...?

1531
02:07:40,410 --> 02:07:43,997
It's okay. Come on.

1532
02:07:53,048 --> 02:07:55,676
- The evidence of things not seen.

1533
02:07:55,843 --> 02:07:59,596
By faith, Abel offered God a better gift...

1534
02:07:59,763 --> 02:08:03,058
...than his brother, Cain.
Better by faith.

1535
02:08:04,977 --> 02:08:10,107
Cain left God. Cain fell from faith.

1536
02:08:11,108 --> 02:08:15,654
He went out from the Lord
and he dwelt in the land of Nod...

1537
02:08:16,947 --> 02:08:19,241
...on the east of Eden.

1538
02:08:20,367 --> 02:08:22,619
Amen.

1539
02:08:22,953 --> 02:08:25,330
Let's all rise.

1540
02:11:10,495 --> 02:11:13,790
What about the Tropicana?
What's wrong with the Opry?

1541
02:11:13,957 --> 02:11:17,002
He was banned after he
smashed up the footlights.

1542
02:11:17,169 --> 02:11:21,048
Well, if he smashes lights at Folsom,
they're gonna keep him there.

1543
02:11:21,215 --> 02:11:26,428
Look, Frank, while Johnny was
out recuperating, the world changed.

1544
02:11:26,595 --> 02:11:28,764
Dylan's gone electric.

1545
02:11:28,931 --> 02:11:32,309
The Byrds are electric, the Beatles are
electric. Hell, everybody's electric.

1546
02:11:32,768 --> 02:11:35,229
He needs a fresh sound,
and all he wants to do...

1547
02:11:35,395 --> 02:11:37,940
...is cut a live album with
the same old pickers...

1548
02:11:38,106 --> 02:11:40,609
...at a maximum security penitentiary.

1549
02:11:40,776 --> 02:11:43,403
You can talk to me, you know.
I'm standing right here.

1550
02:11:43,570 --> 02:11:46,073
And what's with the black?
It's depressing.

1551
02:11:46,532 --> 02:11:48,450
Looks like you're going to a funeral.

1552
02:11:49,409 --> 02:11:51,578
Maybe I am.

1553
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,541
Your fans are church folk, Johnny.

1554
02:11:55,791 --> 02:11:57,125
Christians.

1555
02:11:57,292 --> 02:11:58,961
They don't wanna
hear you singing...

1556
02:11:59,127 --> 02:12:02,923
...to a bunch of murderers and rapists,
trying to cheer them up.

1557
02:12:05,843 --> 02:12:08,303
Well, they're not Christians then.

1558
02:12:09,263 --> 02:12:11,265
I'm fine with you doing a live record.

1559
02:12:11,473 --> 02:12:15,227
Just not at a prison.
That's my compromise.

1560
02:12:21,108 --> 02:12:23,360
January 13th...

1561
02:12:23,527 --> 02:12:27,739
...l'll be at Folsom Prison
with June and the boys.

1562
02:12:28,198 --> 02:12:30,200
You listen to the tapes.

1563
02:12:30,367 --> 02:12:34,454
If you don't like them, toss them.

1564
02:12:43,964 --> 02:12:46,008
Mr. Cash?

1565
02:12:46,175 --> 02:12:48,218
M... Mr. Cash?

1566
02:12:49,303 --> 02:12:50,804
Mr. Cash?

1567
02:12:52,514 --> 02:12:55,517
Might I suggest you refrain from
playing any more tunes...

1568
02:12:55,684 --> 02:13:02,816
...that remind them, the inmates, that is,
that, well... That they're in prison.

1569
02:13:03,901 --> 02:13:06,236
You think they forgot?

1570
02:13:06,653 --> 02:13:09,156
Perhaps you and your wife
could do another spiritual.

1571
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:12,743
That's not my wife, warden.

1572
02:13:14,745 --> 02:13:17,414
I keep asking her,
and she keeps saying no.

1573
02:13:23,962 --> 02:13:25,964
You ever drink this water, warden?

1574
02:13:26,965 --> 02:13:30,928
No. No, I'm a Coca-Cola man.

1575
02:13:48,362 --> 02:13:50,864
All right.

1576
02:14:03,001 --> 02:14:05,504
I wanna remind you we're
recording live here today...

1577
02:14:05,671 --> 02:14:08,549
...so you can't say hell or shit
or anything like that.

1578
02:14:11,635 --> 02:14:15,097
I gotta tell you, I can't tell you
how many shows we've done...

1579
02:14:15,264 --> 02:14:17,474
...but this is the best
audience we ever had.

1580
02:14:17,641 --> 02:14:19,560
I wanna thank you for that.

1581
02:14:23,814 --> 02:14:28,026
You know, standing back there in
your shop, catching my breath...

1582
02:14:28,193 --> 02:14:30,988
...I come to admire you even more.

1583
02:14:31,196 --> 02:14:34,074
You see, I never had to
do hard time like you.

1584
02:14:34,241 --> 02:14:36,618
Although I have, on occasion...

1585
02:14:36,827 --> 02:14:38,954
...got myself busted.

1586
02:14:40,122 --> 02:14:43,834
Once in El Paso I had this bag of...
Oh, you heard about that?

1587
02:14:44,001 --> 02:14:46,044
You been in El Paso too?

1588
02:14:46,211 --> 02:14:48,672
Well, anyways I felt tough,
you know?

1589
02:14:48,839 --> 02:14:52,176
Like I'd seen a thing or two,
you know?

1590
02:14:54,178 --> 02:14:56,471
Well, that was till a moment ago.

1591
02:14:56,638 --> 02:15:00,684
Because I gotta tell you,
my hat's off to you now.

1592
02:15:00,851 --> 02:15:05,814
Because I ain't never had to drink this
yellow water you got here at Folsom.

1593
02:15:15,157 --> 02:15:17,576
This song is for your warden.

1594
02:15:17,743 --> 02:15:21,455
<i>Early one mornin'</i>
<i>While makin' the rounds</i>

1595
02:15:21,622 --> 02:15:25,334
<i>I took a shot of cocaine</i>
<i>And I shot my woman down</i>

1596
02:15:25,501 --> 02:15:29,171
<i>I went right home and I went to bed</i>

1597
02:15:29,338 --> 02:15:33,509
<i>I stuck that lovin' forty-four</i>
<i>Beneath my head</i>

1598
02:15:33,759 --> 02:15:37,095
<i>Got up next mornin'</i>
<i>And I grabbed that gun</i>

1599
02:15:37,262 --> 02:15:41,433
<i>Took a shot of cocaine and away I run</i>

1600
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:44,853
<i>Made a good run but I run too slow</i>

1601
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:48,607
<i>They overtook me</i>
<i>Down in Juárez, Mexico</i>

1602
02:15:49,441 --> 02:15:53,153
<i>Late in the hot joint takin' the pills</i>

1603
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:56,573
<i>In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill</i>

1604
02:15:56,740 --> 02:16:00,702
<i>He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not</i>
<i>Jack Brown"</i>

1605
02:16:00,869 --> 02:16:04,623
<i>"You're the dirty hack that</i>
<i>Shot your woman down"</i>

1606
02:16:05,958 --> 02:16:07,751
I was dressed in black.

1607
02:16:08,710 --> 02:16:11,922
<i>When I was arrested</i>
<i>I was dressed in black</i>

1608
02:16:12,464 --> 02:16:16,468
<i>They put me on a train</i>
<i>And they took me back</i>

1609
02:16:16,677 --> 02:16:19,888
<i>Had no friend for to go my bail</i>

1610
02:16:20,097 --> 02:16:24,101
<i>They slapped my dried-up carcass</i>
<i>In the county jail</i>

1611
02:16:24,601 --> 02:16:28,313
<i>The judge, he smiled</i>
<i>As he picked up his pen</i>

1612
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:32,234
<i>Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen</i>

1613
02:16:32,568 --> 02:16:36,029
<i>Ninety-nine years underneath that ground</i>

1614
02:16:36,238 --> 02:16:39,741
<i>I can't forget the day</i>
<i>I shot that bad bitch down</i>

1615
02:16:40,367 --> 02:16:43,829
<i>Come on, you gotta listen unto me</i>

1616
02:16:43,996 --> 02:16:48,959
<i>Lay off that whiskey</i>
<i>And let that cocaine be</i>

1617
02:16:50,294 --> 02:16:52,379
All right!

1618
02:17:16,153 --> 02:17:18,113
In the back.

1619
02:17:37,841 --> 02:17:39,801
Hey, June.

1620
02:17:42,387 --> 02:17:44,056
June.

1621
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:48,644
What's wrong, John?

1622
02:17:49,353 --> 02:17:53,857
I don't know. Bad dreams. Memories.

1623
02:17:55,067 --> 02:17:58,070
Well, you need to get
some rest, sweetie.

1624
02:17:58,904 --> 02:18:01,114
You did good tonight.

1625
02:18:01,281 --> 02:18:05,202
- But we got another show tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1626
02:18:05,369 --> 02:18:07,996
Hey, listen.

1627
02:18:08,205 --> 02:18:12,459
The thing is, I think it's time now.

1628
02:18:12,626 --> 02:18:14,419
You know? I think it's about time.

1629
02:18:14,586 --> 02:18:17,548
- Time for what?
- For you and me...

1630
02:18:18,382 --> 02:18:19,925
...to get married.

1631
02:18:22,886 --> 02:18:25,305
Go to sleep, John.

1632
02:18:26,181 --> 02:18:27,933
I don't wanna sleep.

1633
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:31,520
I wanna marry you,
and I'm telling you it's the time.

1634
02:18:32,271 --> 02:18:37,693
Well, I am telling you with 100
percent certainty that it is not the time.

1635
02:18:38,235 --> 02:18:40,070
It's not about time.

1636
02:18:40,237 --> 02:18:43,907
It's not the right time.
It's not even a quarter to the right time.

1637
02:18:45,117 --> 02:18:46,785
June.

1638
02:18:48,412 --> 02:18:49,746
How do you know when...?

1639
02:18:49,913 --> 02:18:53,166
You haven't been clean
even six months.

1640
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:57,754
Except for a honeymoon, you have not
thought about what you're asking me.

1641
02:18:57,921 --> 02:19:00,007
Yes, I have.

1642
02:19:00,174 --> 02:19:02,551
I have. It's all I've thought about.

1643
02:19:02,759 --> 02:19:04,761
Well, how's it gonna work, John?

1644
02:19:04,928 --> 02:19:06,972
Where we gonna live?

1645
02:19:07,139 --> 02:19:09,391
What about my girls?

1646
02:19:09,558 --> 02:19:12,519
What about your girls?
What about your parents, John?

1647
02:19:12,686 --> 02:19:15,147
Your daddy won't even look at me.

1648
02:19:15,314 --> 02:19:17,441
June, that stuff will
just work itself out.

1649
02:19:17,649 --> 02:19:19,151
No, it doesn't work itself out.

1650
02:19:19,318 --> 02:19:22,279
People work it out for you,
and you think it works itself out.

1651
02:19:24,364 --> 02:19:26,700
- You're scared.
- What?

1652
02:19:27,284 --> 02:19:29,745
Scared of being in love.

1653
02:19:30,913 --> 02:19:33,999
Scared of losing control.
And you know what, June Carter?

1654
02:19:34,166 --> 02:19:37,544
I think you're scared of living
in my big fat shadow.

1655
02:19:37,753 --> 02:19:39,505
- That's your problem.
- Oh, really?

1656
02:19:39,671 --> 02:19:41,215
- Is that my problem?
- Yeah, it is.

1657
02:19:41,381 --> 02:19:43,258
My problem is it's 2 a.m.

1658
02:19:43,425 --> 02:19:45,093
My problem is I'm asleep.

1659
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:47,262
I'm on a tour bus with
eight stinking men.

1660
02:19:47,429 --> 02:19:49,932
Rule number one:
Don't propose to a girl on a bus.

1661
02:19:50,098 --> 02:19:51,725
You got that? Rule number two:

1662
02:19:51,892 --> 02:19:54,770
Don't tell her it's because
you had a bad dream.

1663
02:19:56,146 --> 02:19:58,524
- June?
- What?

1664
02:19:59,107 --> 02:20:00,901
Marry me.

1665
02:20:06,281 --> 02:20:07,908
Okay.

1666
02:20:09,576 --> 02:20:13,205
Well, that's... That's the last time
I'm asking.

1667
02:20:13,413 --> 02:20:16,542
Well, good. I hate reruns.

1668
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:28,011
I got your extra bag.
You don't have to bother...

1669
02:20:30,931 --> 02:20:32,266
Hey, June?

1670
02:20:35,227 --> 02:20:36,854
June.

1671
02:20:38,063 --> 02:20:39,690
June?

1672
02:20:46,363 --> 02:20:48,115
What, you're not talking to me?

1673
02:20:48,323 --> 02:20:50,951
You are not allowed to speak to me.
After that stunt...

1674
02:20:51,118 --> 02:20:53,495
...you're only allowed to
speak to me on-stage.

1675
02:20:53,662 --> 02:20:56,331
- Do you understand?
- What'd I do?

1676
02:20:56,498 --> 02:20:58,333
Why don't you ask
your big fat shadow?

1677
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:00,169
- Come on, baby.
- "Come on, baby."

1678
02:21:00,335 --> 02:21:03,672
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

1679
02:21:05,424 --> 02:21:09,011
<i>The taste of love is sweet</i>

1680
02:21:10,762 --> 02:21:13,849
<i>When hearts like ours meet</i>

1681
02:21:15,475 --> 02:21:18,020
<i>I fell for you like a child</i>

1682
02:21:19,646 --> 02:21:23,150
<i>Oh, but the fire went wild</i>

1683
02:21:24,526 --> 02:21:28,780
<i>I fell into a burning ring offire</i>

1684
02:21:28,947 --> 02:21:33,869
<i>I went down, down, down</i>
<i>And the flames went higher</i>

1685
02:21:34,036 --> 02:21:39,208
<i>And it burns, burns, burns</i>
<i>The ring of fire</i>

1686
02:21:39,416 --> 02:21:44,171
<i>The ring of fire</i>
<i>The ring of fire</i>

1687
02:21:44,338 --> 02:21:48,717
<i>The ring of fire</i>
<i>The ring of fire</i>

1688
02:21:57,184 --> 02:21:59,394
All right. Thank you.

1689
02:22:01,855 --> 02:22:04,733
I don't know if y'all know
who wrote that song...

1690
02:22:04,900 --> 02:22:09,071
...but it's this long-legged gal standing
right here, Miss June Carter.

1691
02:22:10,155 --> 02:22:12,491
Thanks, y'all. Thank you very much.

1692
02:22:12,699 --> 02:22:15,410
So, June, you gonna
stand over there all night...

1693
02:22:15,577 --> 02:22:17,996
...or you wanna come over
here and sing with me?

1694
02:22:18,705 --> 02:22:21,083
I'll sing with you.
You sure that's what you want?

1695
02:22:21,250 --> 02:22:23,961
- Yeah.
- All right. Hold on.

1696
02:22:29,091 --> 02:22:32,010
- Well, folks, what do you say?
All right, Johnny.

1697
02:22:32,177 --> 02:22:35,097
You wanna hear "Jackson"?

1698
02:22:39,601 --> 02:22:42,563
I thought you was gonna wax
poetic a little bit longer.

1699
02:22:42,729 --> 02:22:45,941
- Oh, no, I'm done with that, June.
- Okay, good.

1700
02:22:54,324 --> 02:22:57,744
<i>- We got married in a fever</i>
<i>- We got married in a fever</i>

1701
02:22:57,911 --> 02:23:01,456
<i>- Hotter than a pepper sprout</i>
<i>- Hotter than a pepper sprout</i>

1702
02:23:01,665 --> 02:23:05,085
<i>- We've been talking about Jackson</i>
<i>- We've been talking about Jackson</i>

1703
02:23:05,294 --> 02:23:08,213
<i>Ever since the fire went out</i>

1704
02:23:08,380 --> 02:23:10,883
<i>I'm going to Jackson</i>

1705
02:23:11,049 --> 02:23:14,511
<i>I'm gonna mess around</i>

1706
02:23:14,678 --> 02:23:18,223
<i>Yeah, I'm going to Jackson</i>

1707
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:21,393
<i>Look out, Jackson town</i>

1708
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:25,189
<i>Well, go on down to Jackson</i>

1709
02:23:25,355 --> 02:23:28,609
<i>Go ahead and wreck your health</i>

1710
02:23:28,775 --> 02:23:31,904
<i>Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man</i>

1711
02:23:32,070 --> 02:23:35,532
<i>Make a big fool of yourself</i>

1712
02:23:35,741 --> 02:23:38,577
<i>You're going to Jackson</i>

1713
02:23:38,744 --> 02:23:40,871
<i>Go comb your hair</i>

1714
02:23:45,584 --> 02:23:48,003
<i>See if I care</i>

1715
02:23:56,053 --> 02:23:59,223
Sorry for the interruption, folks...

1716
02:23:59,389 --> 02:24:03,644
...but I gotta ask June here a question
before we finish this song.

1717
02:24:04,228 --> 02:24:06,104
What's that, John?

1718
02:24:08,649 --> 02:24:10,859
Will you marry me?

1719
02:24:13,987 --> 02:24:15,906
Why don't we just sing
the song, John.

1720
02:24:16,281 --> 02:24:17,950
No, darling.

1721
02:24:20,369 --> 02:24:23,997
Come on, finish the song.
People wanna hear us sing.

1722
02:24:26,291 --> 02:24:27,960
Sorry, folks...

1723
02:24:28,168 --> 02:24:32,506
...but I just can't do this song anymore
unless she's gonna marry me.

1724
02:24:32,673 --> 02:24:35,175
It'd just be like we're lying.

1725
02:24:35,843 --> 02:24:37,553
You got these people
all revved up, John.

1726
02:24:37,761 --> 02:24:40,931
- Now, come on, let's sing "Jackson."
- You got me all revved up.

1727
02:24:41,098 --> 02:24:45,769
I've asked you 40 different ways, it's
time you come up with a fresh answer.

1728
02:24:47,271 --> 02:24:49,064
Please sing.

1729
02:24:49,523 --> 02:24:53,610
I'm asking you to marry me.

1730
02:24:53,777 --> 02:24:55,946
I love you, June.

1731
02:24:58,282 --> 02:25:00,701
Now, I know I've said and
done a lot of things...

1732
02:25:00,868 --> 02:25:06,164
...that I hurt you. But I promise
I'll never do that again.

1733
02:25:06,331 --> 02:25:08,458
I only wanna take care of you.

1734
02:25:08,625 --> 02:25:13,172
I will not leave you like that Dutch
boy with your finger in the dam.

1735
02:25:17,176 --> 02:25:19,511
You're my best friend.

1736
02:25:20,596 --> 02:25:22,681
Marry me.

1737
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:31,648
All right.

1738
02:25:32,316 --> 02:25:34,151
Yeah?

1739
02:25:55,130 --> 02:25:57,799
In case none of y'all heard,
she said yes.

1740
02:26:04,806 --> 02:26:07,518
She finally said yes.

1741
02:26:40,759 --> 02:26:43,804
Grandpa, here. Let's talk on this.

1742
02:26:43,971 --> 02:26:47,641
- What do you want me to do with it?
- Well, you listen and you talk.

1743
02:26:47,850 --> 02:26:51,478
It's a tin-can telephone,
and the sound goes up the string.

1744
02:26:53,021 --> 02:26:55,440
Hello, grand girls.

1745
02:26:55,607 --> 02:26:57,276
Hello, grand girls.

1746
02:26:57,442 --> 02:27:00,821
Can you hear us?
- Hello, Roseanne.

1747
02:27:00,988 --> 02:27:03,323
- Hello, Carlene.
- You gotta pull it tight, Daddy.

1748
02:27:03,490 --> 02:27:05,617
Grandpa, speak.
Talk, Grandpa.

1749
02:27:05,784 --> 02:27:07,911
- Tell us a story.
Speak. Grandpa.

1750
02:27:08,078 --> 02:27:11,081
- Take it and talk to them.
- They wanna talk to their grandpa.

1751
02:27:11,248 --> 02:27:14,543
Well, I don't got no stories.
You got all the stories. You...

1752
02:27:16,712 --> 02:27:18,630
Why don't you tell
them about the flood?

1753
02:27:18,922 --> 02:27:22,759
About how you made a boat out of the
front door and got us all out of there.

1754
02:27:22,968 --> 02:27:24,928
They'll like that.

1755
02:27:25,095 --> 02:27:28,932
Tell us.
- Go on, tell them. Pull the string tight.

1756
02:27:29,683 --> 02:27:34,855
It was 1937. There was a flood.
