00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,512
In '78, I came to Europe for the first time
to compete outside Brazil in the World Championship

3
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,313
It was pure driving, pure racing.

4
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,599
There wasn't any politics.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,230
No money involved either.
It was real racing.

6
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,597
We did not think that karting
could become a career.

7
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,680
AYRTON'S FATHER
MILTON DA SILVA

8
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,270
But it has become a
big part of our lives

9
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,471
and we are a bit worried because
then along came Formula One.

10
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,037
May God protect him forever.

11
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,239
AYRTON'S MOTHER
NEYDE SENNA

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,959
All the dangers are my biggest fear.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,031
I would like to thank him
because he is a good son

14
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,954
and this year he has worked
very hard and honestly.

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,194
For me, it is more important than any title.

16
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,835
Few really do know myself

17
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,913
They just don't understand what it takes
to be a racing driver.

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,754
Somebody that has, left behind,

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,513
thousands and thousands of miles away,
family and friends

20
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,396
to live in Europe.

21
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,469
Being so young.
I have always been fighting.

22
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,431
Nothing ever has come easy.

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,151
The time has come.

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,074
Ayrton is ready to ride for the first time
a Formula One car.

25
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,758
I believe it was God
to give me this opportunity,

26
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,837
I've been waiting a long time.

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,590
And now it is also helping
to remain calm, tranquil, relaxed.

28
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,110
Well I always liked the combination of
the man and the machine

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,195
I think that's the real special quality
that motor racing in general

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,750
and, particular, particularly Formula One has

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,069
And you know people say:
"Oh, It's all about the car, isn't it?"

32
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,280
Well, actually it's not. But the car is
certainly, 50%, maybe even a little bit more

33
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,715
Even if it's 75% or 80%,

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,519
The other 20%, which is represented by the driver

35
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,557
is absolutely crucial.
That can make the difference.

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,117
But the cars themselves - you either believe this or you don't -

37
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,953
The cars themselves are beautiful things.

38
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,917
They are a little less beautiful when they are painted
like cigarette packets

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,389
or whatever they paint them as now, perhaps,

40
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:03,237
but there's a beauty to the
sense of form following function,

41
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,437
that the form of the car
expresses in some way

42
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,717
the speed that they are going
to go at when they start moving

43
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,474
And the details of the engineering,

44
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,997
even if you are not technically literate,
are very beautiful.

45
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,518
They are beautiful bits of
sculptures, if you like.

46
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:29,274
And that combination of the
beautiful, inanimate machines

47
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,629
and the hero figures of the drivers

48
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,951
the sense of courage and romance,
and that sort of thing

49
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,156
is what attracted me, I think,
when I was a small boy.

50
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,750
I think Formula One in the 80s was

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,831
one of the most glorious times
in Formula One

52
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,071
The cars were almost simple,
compared to what they are now.

53
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:03,598
The steering wheel only turned the car.
The gear lever, shifted the gears.

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,434
It was a time when drivers
still made the difference

55
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,435
and all the engineering expertise
and all the eletronics

56
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,749
still left a great deal for the driver to do.

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,918
You had Alain Prost, known as "The Professor"

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,151
A very smooth, calculating driver

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,788
You had Nelson Piquet, who was Brazilian,

60
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,034
very emotional, very clever, cunning driver.

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,793
You had Nigel Mansell, who was sort of a British lion

62
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,670
who was very exciting to watch,
very spectacular driver.

63
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,069
And then you had Senna, the virtuoso.

64
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,707
And to see these drivers competing
with each other

65
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,949
At more or less the same stage
in their careers,

66
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,312
overlapping slightly, in a way,

67
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,995
but really at their peak together, was phenomenal.

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,788


69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,670
Ayrton, this is a beautiful city,

70
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,435
with wonderful streets to walk,
but unsuitable to host a race, no?

71
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,555
REGINALDO LEME

72
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,470
Indeed. I arrived at the last minute

73
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,148
and I was surprised.
I've never been to Monaco.

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,437
I did some testing

75
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,512
and fortunately, I managed
to adapt to the track.

76
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,356
There is no margin for error,
any error would result in an accident.

77
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,358
But for now, I'm satisfied.

78
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,670
I was travelling a lot, as a
Formula One journalist

79
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,672
when Ayrton began to be noticed
driving a Toleman.

80
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,749
VOICE OF REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR

81
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,990
Toleman was not a winning team.

82
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,069
The car was bad and never won a race.

83
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,713
That's why what Ayrton did in Monaco
was true genius.

84
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,233
Now, lots of drivers do that.
Join a small team,

85
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,274
and disappear without a trace.
They perform to the level of the team.

86
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,716
But there is sort of a rare breed of drivers,
of which Senna was absolutely one,

87
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,951
who can go into a small team

88
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,511
and perform so far above the perceived
level of the car

89
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,475
That everybody turns around and thinks:
"How did he do that?"

90
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,509
What he had done
was to make everybody, *everybody* in the paddock,

91
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,990
aware of what he could do,
who he was and what his potential was.

92
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,959
That he could take this car
which had nothing,

93
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,314
and deliver a result like that,

94
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,709
in the worst possible conditions
for a racing driveer.

95
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,470
It is impossible to overestimate
how frightening it is

96
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,908
to race in the rain, how difficult it is.

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,036
Racing drivers can't see anything if it rains,

98
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,509
especially if they are behind another car.

99
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,672
The big tires they have now
throw up so much spray

100
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,956
that it's like driving in thick, thick, thick fog.

101
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,355
You know, like tring to drive on a motorway
in a thick fog,

102
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,956
with 20 yards of visibility,
at racing speeds.

103
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,639
And to be able to do that, you know,
really sorts out

104
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,789
the great racing drivers from the pretty good ones.

105
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,792
Alain Prost, now after a superb start,
has got away in the lead.

106
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,000
Monaco Grand Prix
3 June 1984
Eighth race Senna in Formula One

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,309
Nigel Mansell second,
the two Ferraris third and fourth.

108
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,119
Niki Lauda is in fifth position.

109
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,599
Sixth is Rosberg.

110
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,115
Seventh is Manfred Winkelhock.
Eighth is Ayrton Senna.

111
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,354
But Senna has come up through the field

112
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,557
He started in thirteenth place
and is now seventh.

113
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,832
Off goes Nigel Mansell!

114
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:34,000
Ayrton Senna has now passed Keke Rosberg
and is in third place

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,552
Ayrton Senna
takes second place!

118
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,951
At the most dangerous part of the track!

VOICE OF JAMES HUNT
1976 FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPION

120
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,390
Well I think we are watching the arrival
of Ayrton Senna,

121
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,832
a truly outstanding talent.

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,548
He is catching Alain Prost
something like three seconds a lap

123
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,068
And that is pretty staggering performance.

124
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,515
Prost is waving his hand to the officals.
He wants to stop the race.

125
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,113
But who can blame him?

126
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,634
There is in fact, from a purist
and dispassionate point of view

127
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,239
that there is no reason to stop the race.

128
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,629
There is an official infront of me
with a red flag.

129
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,557
They want to stop running.

130
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,158
And the checkered flag is going out

131
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,157
Incredible!

132
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,067
And Prost is stopping!
and Senna crosses the line before he gets there!

133
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,116
Ayrton raises his arms
and gesturing with enthusiasm!

134
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,511
Celebrating as if he won the race!

135
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,836
If we had continued for a few more laps,

136
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,149
I am sure Ayrton would have passed him.

137
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,275
I had a serious chance of winning.

138
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,677
But until you cross the finishing line
in first position,

139
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,994
it is impossible to make a prediction.

140
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,674
Formula One is politics, money

141
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,794
and while you are making your way through it,
you must deal with such things.

142
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,797
You have Alain Prost, a world champion,

143
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,552
out there, leading the Monaco Grand Prix,

144
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,316
survivng all those wet corners, going by many wrecks,

145
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,517
driving his heart out
for a victory at Monaco

146
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,831
And here comes,
first year Formula One driver

147
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,072
from some place in Brazil,
Ayrton Senna.

148
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,072
Now, this was one of the wettest races
I've ever been in

149
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,389
and it needed to be stopped.

150
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,630
But what Senna could not get, was that,

151
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,913
It was in a French area,
considered a French event

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,994
with the FIA being housed in Paris

153
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,596
and run by Frenchmen.

154
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,514
To him, there had to be some reason
beside the rain,

155
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,399
that was no problem to him,

156
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,436
to where they took this victory away from him.

157
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,475
He knew that in another three or four laps

158
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,312
he would catch Prost,
find a way around him

159
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,991
and he would be in the number one position.

160
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,629
A tragic result for Senna. However,

161
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,591
if he is not the
World Champion this year,

162
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,595
He will undoubtedly be World Champion in the future,
if his career continues.

163
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,797
Ayrton Senna
the new star of Formula One!

164
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,307
Appearing for the first time
on the Formula One podium

165
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,875
after a fantastic performance.

166
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,674
What about next year?

167
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,671
Are you going to stay with the Toleman team?

168
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,636
-What are your plans now?
-I don't know.

170
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,673

00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,315
We have to wait more time to see what happens.

172
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,187
You are not going to be satisfied
until you are in a winning position though are you?

173
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,239
I belive if you are doing something, like competing,
like motor racing

174
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,754
you have either do well,
or forget it.

175
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,517
I remember in Detroit,
a couple of weeks later,

176
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,871
it was already a buzz between the media

177
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,029
managers and sponsors,
looking after him

178
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,317
I remember Philip Morris making a deal,

179
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,278
a personal contract with him after that.

180
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,673
And we knew he would not stay at the Toleman
for the three years

181
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,671
for the supposed length of his contract,

182
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,149
because the Toleman team was not really improving

183
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,029
and the potential of the team was not big enough
for a talent.

184
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,794


185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,471
LOTUS

186
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,309
Lotus was the perfect place for Ayrton to move to.

187
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,389
VOICE OF JOHN BISIGNAGNO
ESPN COMMENTATOR

188
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,110
It was a team that had won Championships,
and had won many Grand Prix

189
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,711
and they worked very very hard
around Ayrton, to give his talent

190
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,758
all the facilities that he needed to win.

191
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,433
When I first come to
Formula One in '84,

192
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,918
I was starting.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,275
I had so much to learn and to achieve.

194
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,989
Anything, any good result
was a progress

195
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,991
was a motivation.

196
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,119
Then I changed
to a bigger team, to Lotus,

197
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,033
and still went up, and up and up.

198
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,798
I'm still doing it.

199
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,749
So even when I have some problems,
I look always to the next race.

200
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,399
Because maybe one race I have no chance,
but the next one or the next five, will be good

201
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,350
against one bad one.

202
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,753
So you got to try and make the numbers
bigger and bigger.

203
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,196
Even as a child, he
always knew what he wanted

204
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,192
and he always got it.

205
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,868
AYRTON'S MOTHER
NEYDA SENNA

206
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,191
For example, he always paid attention
in the classroom at school,

207
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,833
so he didn't have to study at home

208
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,707
and so he had more time
to play on his go-kart.

209
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,232
There is no doubt, that Senna came
from a background of privilege.

210
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,197
VOICE OF RICHARD WILLIAMS
SPORTS JOURNALIST, THE GUARDIAN

211
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,952
His family was very comfortably off.

212
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,432
Once they recognized
that his ambition was to be a racing driver,

213
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,754
they had no problem backing his early
efforts in go-karts.

214
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,677
But it would be a great mistake to think that he
was able to buy his way into Formula One.

215
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,071
Senna himself realized

216
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,758
that to make a serious, lasting impact on Formula One

217
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,634
he had to fight his way into it
by virtue of his talent.

218
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,197
PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX - APRIL 21st 1985
AYRTON'S SECOND RACE WITH LOTUS

219
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,990
Ayrton was exceptional when it rained.

REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR

221
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,433
When the conditions were bad
and the track became slippery

222
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,918
he had a higher gear.

223
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,870
The Estoril race was incredible.

224
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,110
He lapped all his opponents except one.

225
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,475
It is wonderful!
An extraordinary feeling.

226
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,359
I am very happy because,
in my second year in Formula One,

227
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,150
I managed to fulfill my first dream,
which was to win my first Grand Prix.

228
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,230
It is a unique thing.

229
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,273
It's like a drug.

230
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,387
This is something so strong and intense.

231
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,711
Once you experience it,
you keep searching for it all the time.

232
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,512
It was raining really hard.
There was no competition, really.

233
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,231
He would have won that race if it was run 100 times.

234
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,232
It was an important race for
Brazil for many reasons,

235
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,074
including the fact that on that day,

236
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,471
the first elected Brazilian President,
Tancredo Neves, died.

237
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,075
It was a very important
political moment for Brazil,

238
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,594
because he was the first elected president

239
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,672
after the end of the dictatorship.

240
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,912
He was ill for a long time and died.

241
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,914
There was a risk that Brazil
would suffer another blow

242
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,991
or something like that, which nobody wanted.

243
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,596
Senna's win was very important
in that sense,

244
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,230
for the public and the Brazilian people
and for us there,

245
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,950
and I'm sure he also realized this
later in the evening

246
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,316
when we were at dinner. We went to dinner,

247
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,358
but later that night after leaving the
restaurant he caught a plane to return to Brazil.

248
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,194
I'm Mili Okada
from Japan TV

249
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,677
Fuji TV. I am just a TV personality,
not a news reporter, so,

250
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,233
I see! Let's make a picture together.

251
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,308
MILI OKADA
FUJI TV

252
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,837
I think many Japanese girls are fans of Mr. Senna.

253
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,679
Now I am close to him
and I'm so nervous ...

254
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,114
Come and see Japan.
and see you in Japan.

255
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,474
-Thank you! A little kiss.
-Thanks.

256
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,516
Bye bye! Another kiss.

257
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,394
He was very complete.

258
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,519
From tires to the engine,
to every single component of the car,

259
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,157
He wanted to know everything.

260
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,836
He wasa pushing ever mechanic and every
engineer to the very limit,

261
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,391
to understand, first of all
and to improve the overall package

262
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,797
And it took a lot of his energy,

263
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,631
but he was concentrating as much on that aspect of the job
as driving itself.

264
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,669
He was the first one maybe,
to stay at the circuit

265
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,513
Until nine, ten o' clock
with the engineers and mechanics.

266
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,276
Didn't want to go back to the hotel
or go play golf like Alain Prost and a few others.

267
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,433
There's only one word to describe Ayrton's style:

268
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,750
and that is, "Fast".

269
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,953
He would take the car
beyond its designed capabilities.

270
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:22,833
He would brake later, fly into these corners
where the car was just, over the edge.

271
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,713
And somehow, he could dance a dance
with that car

272
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,634
to where it stayed on the track.

273
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,638
As I watched Ayrton's early career,

274
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,835
Voice of Ron Dennis
Team manager McLaren

275
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,673
what was very apparent was his pace and his dedication

276
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,713
But, in the end, what you're looking for is an intellect

277
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,112
And I thought, "This guy's got what it takes."

278
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,516
But it pretty soon became apparent that

279
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,875
Lotus wasn't going to be big enough for him

280
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,556
Lotus was actually a team
just beginning its decline.

281
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,998
I think when he was there, really,

282
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,270
there was nothing he could do to stop it.

283
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,436
Y'know, the driver doesn't design the car.

284
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,277
And so he did what he had done before,
and what great drivers do,

285
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,511
which was to move again,
to an even more competitive team.

286
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,034
Such an important instinct for a driver, that.

287
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,837
To know where to be.

288
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,229
To know not who is competitive, this season.

289
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,151
But who is going to be competitive next.

290
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,430
At that time the strongest teams
were Williams and McLaren.

291
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,589
McLaren was,

292
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,715
I would say, a constructor
which had always reflected

293
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,876
the same values as Ayrton.

294
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,236
In that sense Ayrton and Ron Dennis
have much in common.

295
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,835
They are both perfectionists...

296
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,234
Let's put it like this. Both have

297
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:06,155
the idea that nothing will go wrong
if something is well planned and executed

298
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,630
and have always fought
by the same ideals.

299
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,435
Ron comes from a background of hard work.

300
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,630
He has struggled to get where he is now

301
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,394
and has been successful in life.
They are both very close.

302
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,788
At that time the trilogy "The best
team, best driver, best car"

303
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,349
was led by Ron Dennis at McLaren.

304
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,717
In the mid-80s,
McLaren was the team to beat.

305
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,112
Ron Dennis was the best manager
Alain Prost was the best driver.

306
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,556
ALAIN PROST
WORLD CHAMPION 1985, 1986

307
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,915
We all called Prost "The Professor"
because he would do

308
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,470
methodically whatever it took
to be ahead on points.

309
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,471
If it meant coming fifth,

310
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,676
He would hold the fifth place
and collect those points,

311
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,833
rather than fighting for second,
third or first place finish.

312
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,509
And, he certainly understood the politics of the sport

313
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,390
and he played that game smarter than anyone.

314
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,151
You're known as "The Professor" of motor racing

315
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,275
SELINA SCOTT
WOGAN TALK SHOW, BBC

316
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,589
because you plan everything out
and you know where you're going

317
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,113
Is that actually true?

318
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,953
I'm very realistic.
So I think when I'm competitive,

319
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,157
I know I'm competitive
When I'm not, I know that I'm not.

320
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,554
Why are there no women racing drivers?

321
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,638
I do not know exactly why
women are not very competitive

322
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,677
in motor racing,
especially in Formula One.

323
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,190
But you know you're a beautiful woman.
and I know somebody at McLaren

324
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,392
who likes you very much.
And I can arrange it.

325
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,471
Alain, you know, if someone teaches me how to drive

326
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,596
a car, a racing car
I may be able to give up this job

327
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,830
There is nothing important
I could not teach you.

328
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,509
Does your wife drive you home?

329
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,188
The first time I really met him and tried to talk to him

330
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,794
was in '84, when we had,

331
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,272
in Germany, we had a Mercedes appearance

332
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,516
and we had a small race in Nurburgring,
with the new Mercedes 190, I think

333
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,349
We had the old, not old but some Formula One drivers,
old Formula One drivers

334
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,916
And I remember Dennis Hulme
and some other driver.

335
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,115
And we had this competition

336
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,917
and some people from Mercedes

337
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,078
asked me, if I could wait
Ayrton at the airport.

338
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,557
We were having a 10, 15 minute time difference.

339
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,951
and I had a car,
so I was waiting for him to bring him there.

340
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,316
It was the first time that we talked together,

341
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,029
and we had a long drive, something like
two or three hours

342
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,270
So we had time to talk.
We didn't talk very much

343
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:07,714
but he was... he looked impressed. He looked impressed

344
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,269
because I was driving very fast
on the motorway in Germany.

345
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,634
He said, "You're driving faster"

346
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,756
It was nice,
and we were quite close,

347
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,037
because he did not know anybody.

348
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,954
So he was always close to me
during the first day.

349
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,317
And it was funny, because

350
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:34,436
he looked very open, very nice

351
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,115
and then we were starting the practice

352
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,351
and then we were fighting together for the pole position.

353
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,558
And I saw him, very, you know, very competitive.

354
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,355
I'm at the pole, he was second and then at the start

355
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,072
He went before the flag
and I said to myself: "Shit."

356
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,836
"I have to take care of this guy"

357
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,909
That was in '84.

358
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,952
I didn't know we'll be teammates or whatever.

359
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,672
In Formula One your teammate
is your biggest rival,

360
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,836
the first person to beat

361
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,111
because he is the only one who
has a car equal to your own.

362
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,749
I can have the excuse that I run in the
McLaren and the Ferrari is better

363
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,115
or I can be in the Ferrari when the
McLaren is better, but I can't say

364
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,269
that my Ferrari is different
from that of my teammate.

365
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,633
Usually early in his career

366
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,950
when a driver arrives in a team

367
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,792
his main rival is his teammate.

368
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,230
If he goes fatster than his
teammate has a chance to move on.

369
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,913
If he doesn't accomplish this,
it's the end of his career.

370
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,477
Prost had already won
two world championships there.

371
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,152
He'd been there for several seasons,

372
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,834
he was extremely well-established in the team.

373
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,513
He thought of himself
and he thought he got the team to think of him

374
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,067
as the number one driver in the team

375
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,638
the team leader.

376
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,998
The guy to whom most of their efforts were devoted.

377
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,830
But then Senna joined

378
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,835
and Senna was not going to accept a number two
status that's for sure

379
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,070
He hadn't joined the team to be the supporting cast.

380
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,788
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MCLAREN DRIVERS

381
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,675
We are very confident that we have the best two drivers
in the world

382
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,034
RON DENNIS
MCLAREN TEAM MANAGER

383
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,112
And the two most professional drivers as well.

384
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:40,954
And if we're not consistently in the winning circle next year,

385
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,632
Then we certainly won't be able to put the blame on the drivers.

386
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,711
It is a great opportunity for me,
professional,

387
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,517
And on a personal point of view
I feel very happy to work together with Alain.

388
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:02,310
The first year at McLaren was a very
decisive year in the life of Ayrton.

389
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,388
VIVIANE SENNA
AYRTON'S SISTER

390
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,511
He was very nervous.

391
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,516
It was as if he bore the weight
of the world on his shoulders

392
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:15,756
because they now had the responsibility

393
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,237
to demonstrate he was
a first rate driver.

394
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,955
Before Senna arrived at McLaren

395
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,556
Alain Prost was considered the destroyer
of team-mates.

396
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,159
I remember Jo Ramirez said to me:

397
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,548
"Reginald, I am very concerned

398
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,029
"What will happen
with Ayrton Senna at McLaren.

399
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,950
"I know he has talent,
but Prost is a fighter,

400
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,237
"He creates an atmosphere of war

401
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,549
"Which helps him to destroy his opponents,

402
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,711
"As he did with Keke Rosberg."

403
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,155
Using the word "destroy"
in the technical sense.

404
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,992
Destroyed on the track,
beating his opponent mentally.

405
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:05,673
I said to Jo Ramirez:

406
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,671
"Jo, with Senna it will be different.

407
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,199
"Because he has more
talent than the other drivers

408
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,077
"Prost will look to divide the team."

409
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,070
And that's what happened.

410
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,151
Alain Prost was scared..

411
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,788
Despite all that Prost had
in terms of talent,

412
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,791
understanding of race, intelligence

413
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,916
and cold blood, he was surprised

414
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,912
when he began racing with Ayrton.
He would never have thought

415
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,554
a driver could be as good as Ayrton was.

416
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,994


417
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,197
Ayrton, for the first time in his career
has a car able of to be world champion

418
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:58,955
and does not want to let
this chance going away.

419
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,515
-This is normal and this will push on.
-What about you?

420
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,107
-What about you?
-For me it's a little bit different.

421
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,349
You mean you'll let it go?

422
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,554
I have a little more pressure...
you put me more pressure.

423
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,469
I think you could see

424
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,628
VOICE OF RON DENNIS
MCLAREN TEAM MANAGER

425
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,509
smiles, but at the same time,
some slightly strange body language

426
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,917
as they realized just where they were
and what was going to unfold.

427
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,473
Alain, who obviously, felt
he was well nested down at McLaren,

428
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,155
And the young pretender coming in
and clearly threatening that position.

429
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,711
Both had great intellect
and both were very good racing drivers.

430
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,195
Beating each other, became far more challenging

431
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,874
than beating the rest of the field.

432
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,671
He had a target.
That is obvious that when he arrived in Formula One he had a target.

433
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,068
And it was myself.

434
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,432
When I arrived in Formula One,
I was happy to be there.

435
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,194
We had different top drivers.
I've never had any target.

436
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,307
Anybody driver that I
"I want to beat him!"

437
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,631
I had huge respect for the
old drivers.

438
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,674
For Ayrton it was different.
He really wanted to beat me.

439
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:23,549
He really wanted to be World Champion
and beating me

440
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,073
That was really his strength,

441
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,914
that was a plus in his approach

442
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,630
because when you are a racing driver
You want to have motivation.

443
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,673
MONACO GRAND PRIX
14 May 1988

444
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:51,348
1. A. SENNA
2. A. PROST
DIFFERENCE: 55.114 secs

445
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,838
That day, I suddenly realized
I was no longer driving conscious.

446
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,551
And I was in a different dimension for me.

447
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,478
The circuit for me was a tunnel
Which I was just going. Going going

448
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,035
And I realize I was way beyond my conscious understanding.

449
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,833
Ayrton was multiple seconds into the lead.
He had the race in hand.

450
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,909
67/78 LAPS

451
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,313
With only a handful of laps to go
And he received a radio message that said

452
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,311
"You are so far in the lead."
"Slow down."

453
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,989
Ayrton Senna has hit the wall.

454
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,752
Senna is in the barrier!
He's out of the car ...

455
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,751
Ayrton Senna is out of his car
and out of this race.

456
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,752
Ayrton Senna goes out of the lead of the
Monaco Grand Prix.

457
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,637
Absolutely incredible!

458
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,278
A. PROST
WINNER MONACO GP 1988

459
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,598
He never wanted beat me.
He wanted to humiliate me.

460
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,749
VOICE OF ALAIN PROST

461
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,871
He wanted to show the people that
he was much stronger

462
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,712
And much better.
And that was his weakness.

463
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,478
His post-accident emotion
was pure anger with himself.

464
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,952
And he couldn't cope with it. At all

465
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,191
He actually walked back to his apartment

466
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,589
and it was two or three hours before he surfaced.

467
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:52,073
I just came so close to perfection that weekend
that I relaxed

468
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,751
I opened windows for mistakes
And I learned that there

469
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,516
Since then, I progressively
come back because I lost some confidence.

470
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,636
Progressively I fight back

471
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:10,230
and I got much stronger,
after that incident.

472
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,432
Somehow, I got closer to God
and that was very important for me as a man.

473
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,157
Monaco was the turning point in the '88 season

474
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,193
Ayrton went on an amazing run,

475
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,077
winning six of
the next eight races

476
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,596
Putting him just ahead of Prost in the Championship

477
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,317
What happens now, you two?

478
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,795
Good fun, we will have good fun from now on.

479
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,471
Fighting. Maybe we will fight outside the car.

480
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:58,307
I think it's going to get more and
more exciting, the Championship.

481
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,159
Is it possible to be equal in the Championship?

482
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,268
-No.
-Shit.

483
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,476
There can be only one winner.

484
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,476
JAPANESE GRAND PRIX
30th OCTOBER 1988

485
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,679
It is the fifteenth Grand Prix of the season.

486
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,833
As the sun rises, Brazil will await the chequered flag

487
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,675
and for Ayrton Senna to win
his first world title in Formula One,

488
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,994
realising a dream he had
since he was a child.

489
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,994
The pressure was a matter.

490
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,155
VOICE OF PIERRE VAN VILET
TF1 COMMENTATOR

491
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,958
He was in pole.
He was going be world champion,

492
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,516
if he won the race.
The pressure was huge.

493
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,193
We are about to start.
Green light.

494
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,514
Senna does not start!

495
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,677
Senna remains on the grid!

496
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,992
Prost came out ahead
while Ayrton Senna was left behind.

497
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,992
Ayrton Senna is in 14th place.

498
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,788
I thought, "So long title. It's over".

499

REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR

500
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,188
"It's over."

501
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,112
He takes eighth place.
An amazing comeback from Senna.

502
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,153
Then his favourite thing happened,

503
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,592
it began to rain.

504
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,590
Senna is now in fourth position.

505
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,353
Senna goes, goes, goes!

506
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,038
Senna is getting close.
Senna is going to challenge for the lead.

507
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,715
Ayrton Senna overtakes Prost and onwards!

508
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,155
Ayrton Senna has got the lead.

509
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,317
I started giving thanks
during the last lap.

510
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,152
I thanked God

511
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,193
It was incredible. I could not believe
I was going to win the championship,

512
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,715
Despite all the anxiety and tension.

513
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,476
I felt God's presence.

514
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,789
I have seen God

515
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,070
It was a very special moment for me.

516
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,309
An indescribable feeling.

517
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,309
It remains engraved in my
memory and as a part of me.

518
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,556
Ayrton Senna of Brazil!

519
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,431
World Champion 1988!

520
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,867
SAO PAULO

521
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,474
What an incredible race!

522
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,108
A great victory.
He had to come from 16th place.

523
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,878
AYRTON SENNA
WORLD CHAMPION 1988

524
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,355
Ayrton, how do you feel
as World Champion?

525
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,949
I feel so much peace.

526
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,833
It is as if someone had removed
a huge weight

527
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,349
from my shoulders and head.

528
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,594
It is difficult to understand what it means
be a world champion.

529
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,559
What do you say about a man who says
he has seen God in any circumstances

530
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,670
never mind on the last lap of a Grand Prix,

531
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,833
a few yards away from winning the World Championship.

532
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,394
Most people would be skeptical.

533
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,273
And I think most people would be right.

534
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,393
Senna did seem to be absolutely convinced

535
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,393
That he'd seen God.
He didn't say what God was,

536
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,108
how God appeared to him in that moment,

537
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,708
but it's his right to say that.

538
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,509
He must have known that he would risk

539
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,989
looking...well not looking a fool
but attracting skepticism.

540
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,670
And who are we to

541
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,753
challenge that really..
When anybody makes such a claim?

542
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,235
But certainly this is unique
in the history of Grand Prix.

543
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,188
When we are talking about God,

544
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,275
First of all I believe in God too,

545
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,751
but would never use
the same words Ayrton did.

546
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,394
If you are in the same team,
doing the same business

547
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,396
and taking risks with the other drivers
and team members,

548
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,947
this kind of thing
does not make you very comfortable.

549
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,193
because it is not only believing in God,

550
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:20,117
but using that as a strength

551
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,588
having always, the right.

552
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,989
That is, he was thinking he was always right

553
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:34,677
and in this case, it could be dangerous, on the track

554
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,277
and i sometimes felt, not very comfortable.

555
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,197
Yes, there were many cynics

556
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,516
in Formula One

557
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,835
who challenged whether this was

558
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,990
and authentic and real

559
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,034
account of what he felt
and what his values were.

560
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:10,239
But y'know, I was there to witness it
very often

561
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:19,072
in private environments,
and he was most defintely sincere.

562
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,110
This is how he felt.

563
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,748
He felt he was supported by

564
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,875
the God that he believed in

565
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,315
and why on earth would I

566
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,353
or should anybody,
dissuade him from that belief?

567
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,317
Because he

568
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,434
was special, he was committed,

569
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,992
and his strong belief, for me, is a good thing,
as long as they are positive ones.

SAO PAULO
15th NOVEMBER 1988

571
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,791
He is an amazing person, wonderful.

572
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,550
He is very humble and improves the
image of Brazil abroad.

573
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,030
He shares his victory with us.

574
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,315
I admire him very much.

575
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,548
He is very brave man.

576
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,675
I just know this.

577
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,875
We are proud of him.

578
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:30,472
It is one of the few things
that we can still be proud of.

579
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,309
Once, I asked Ayrton
"When will you think about quitting?"

580
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,597
He said, "Mum, the day I am
the champion I will stop."

581
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,030
In my heart,
I knew that was not true.

582
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:42,389
We all know that.

586

After the 1988 Championship,
after he won the title,

587
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,233
We noticed that he had changed between
the beginning and the end of the year.

588
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,797
Because he had found himself.

589
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,074
He had discovered who he was.

590
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:17,153
It was a process that reached
its conclusion after his championship victory.

591
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,032
At Christmas, many things happen.

592
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,472
New friends are made,

593
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:32,036
like the person I'm about to introduce.

XUXA MENEGHEL

He was part of my 1988.

Ayrton Senna.

597
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,190
Isn't he cute?

598
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,391
I have a few question for you.

599
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,597
I think everybody is excited,
but none more than me,

600
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,992
It is not easy to talk.
Ayrton is now my friend.

601
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,197
Ayrton, what do you want for Christmas?

602
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,429
As a Christmas present?

603
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,389
What I really want, I cannot say here!

604
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,072
Why not?

605
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,315
It should be censored.
Let's say I just want to be happy.

606
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,391
Whisper it to me.

607
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,871
Happy New Year.

608
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:32,079
Happy 1990.

609
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,677
Happy '91.

00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,273
Happy '92.

00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:38,630
Happy '93.

VOICE OF RON DENNIS
MCLAREN TEAM MANAGER

614
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,791
1989 season was somewhat less harmonious than the year before

615
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,514
Both drivers took on different levels of aggression.

616
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,715
1 Ayrton Senna
2 Alain Prost

617
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,552
especially when racing each other.

618
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:19,838
It is curious

619
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,197
that the English term "teammate"
is translated into the Portuguese "companheiros de equipe".

620
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,114
I've often used the term
"Enemies of the team".

621
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:34,710
Because if you have two drivers, as
in the case Prost and Ayrton,

622
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,713
as teammates, inevitably
internal strife will arise.

623
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,713
As a journalist and as someone who was in

624
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,552
a TV production meeting,
every weekend

625
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,353
talking about what's the story,

626
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,590
We loved the rivalry.

627
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,233
We loved it on the track, in the garage and in the motorhome afterwards

628
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,711
Ron was really behind Ayrton.

629
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,117
But I understood that very quickly

630
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,869
It's business.
For him it's business, and I always understood.

631
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,467
When I was with Niki,

632
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:21,032
It was, I would say half and half at the beginning

633
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,271
and then he went, obviously, behind me,

634
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,239
because I was
the new generation and Ayrton was,

635
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,117
when I was with him,
the new generation.

636
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,108
Throughout their period in McLaren,
they always had equality.

637
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:45,309
We would go at some points, to quite extreme lengths

638
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,509
Engine choice for example.
Once we have determined

639
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,594
which two engines were going to be used in the race,

640
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,309
then it would be, literally, sort of a number out of the hat routine.

641
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,438
We put the two engine numbers
in some sort of container,

642
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,159
then the drivers would alternate.

643
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:07,954
This was, probably

644
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,117
to eliminate the view

645
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,873
that Honda was selecting which engines went to whom.

646
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,108
But it was,

647
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,112
a degree of paranoia, because it didn't needed much.

648
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,795
A slightly better engine or slightly better set-up

649
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,791
that would determine who won the race.

650
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,358
and who became World Champion.

651
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:32,876
When it was Prost versus Senna in the same team,

652
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,110
you know, the romantics would certainly go with Senna.

653
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:39,556
and the pragmatists would go with Prost.

654
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,791
And Senna could be a bit cruel about it,

655
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,956
but there was some truth that

656
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,554
Prost was one of those that made excuses quite a lot,

657
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,030
which he never liked to hear from racing drivers.

658
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,317
He'd rather they just fessed up, y'know.

659
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,480
"The car wasn't good enough,"
"I wasn't quick enough on the day"

660
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,313
or "That's the way things goes sometimes,"

661
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,157
Prost would tend to go into the minutiae

662
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:08,994
why the car wasn't good enough
or things had worked against him or..

663
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:11,036
You know,

664
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,115
even though every element of the explanation
might have truth in it somehow,

665
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,637
It's unattractive. You don't want to hear it, actually.

666
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,751
That's when the gloves come off in the team.

VOICE OF JOHN BISIGNANO
ESPN COMMENTATOR

668
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:35,715
That's when engineers stopped
sharing information.

669
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,030
That's when drivers start looking over their shoulders to see

670
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,315
who's getting what from whom.

671
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,190
And Ayrton, with his love of truth,

672
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,114
wasn't as in tune as Alain Prost

673
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,550
with adding another dimension:
the politics of sport.

674
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:56,199
Senna and Prost. Prost and Senna.

675
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,635
The order of the grid is always one or the other.

676
00:48:58,719 --> 00:48:59,947
It is a war between them.

677
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,637
For the French driver Alain Prost,

678
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:04,836
he believes his teammate is unfair to him.

679
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,711
and these disagreements could
affect the rest of the season.

680
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,789
Grand Prix after Grand Prix they were
more and more distant from each other.

682
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,876
Ayrton said:
"This Frenchman is tough.

683
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:20,355
"He wants war."

684
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:23,559
After a little more time,

685
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,592
they became completely isolated
and they didn't speak anymore.

JEAN-MARIE BALESTRE
FIA PRESIDENT

687
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,632
Of course having French FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre

00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:39,869
VOICE OF PIERRE VAN VILET
TF1 COMMENTATOR

689
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,679
at that time was all for Alain
because they were close

690
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,112
I remember Jean-Marie Balestre was the man in charge

691
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:06,952
when Senna was denied the chance
to win the Monaco Grand Prix

692
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,635
in the Toleman,
when he was a novice in Formula One.

693
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:16,110
Balestre was a very divisive figure. Very confrontational.

694
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:21,554
Argumentative and autocratic. Very autocratic.

695
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:29,199
And Balestre was still in charge
in the late 80s

696
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,556
and right through to the beginning of the '90s,

697
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,918
when Prost and Senna
had their famous collisions at Suzuka.

698
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,311
And Balestre was the man who attempted to
sanction

699
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,755
and suspend, or whatever, Senna,

700
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,628
who felt that he was being discriminated against

701
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,556
there probably was some justification.

702
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,235
Mr. Balestre had the room
beside me, on the other side,

703
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,996
I entered into the room and Balestre was there

704
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,989
and he came in to my room and we had a talk.

705
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,114
Don't forget that I

706
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:17,320
I had a very intense collaboration with

707
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,675
President Balestre for the safety.

708
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,677
But Ayrton was convinced

709
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,597
that it was a conspiration
and the story starts like this.

710
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,797
and I am very sorry about that.

711
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,871
I would like to give a warm welcome to
the President of FISA, Mr. Balestre.

712
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,188
Please, gentlemen.

JAPANESE GRAND PRIX
PRE-RACE DRIVERS MEETING

714
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,679
All drivers in the world
are looking at you in the TV

715
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,628
because they think, stupidly,
that you are an example.

716
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,077
It is a big mistake,
but they think like that.

717
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,353
I repeat.

718
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,840
No danger
for the end of the World Championship.

719
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,831
Very clear.

720
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,070
Now depend you.

721
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,034
For me, the rest was very simple.

722
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,431
It was very, very clear that I was quicker.

723
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:29,518
And believe me or not, but I was playing with him, during this race

724
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,958
I was very fast. I knew that
normally he could not overtake.

725
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:40,909
But I said to Ron and Ayrton,
two or three races before Suzuka

726
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,512
because every time Ayrton,
tried, especially at the start, to overtake me,

727
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:48,438
I open the door, because I do not want to have a crash.

728
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,548
I said to them:

729
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:53,871
"From now on, no way I will open the door, anymore

730
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,032
"We are fighting as ourselves, I don't care of the
team spirit.

731
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:00,110
"I will fight for myself."

732
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,032
The Championship is neck to neck.

00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,108
to keep the points battle going on till the last race.

736
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:21,429
Prost knows, that if Senna does not finish, he will be the Formula One champion.

Prost jumped into the lead.

741
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,478

744
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,911
Here is an opportunity that Senna is looking for!
And he's going through!

745
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,469
Oh my goodness! This is fantastic!

746
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,278
Finally they clash! It goes in the favour of Prost.

747
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,431
If the race ends like this,
Prost wins the title.

748
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,432
But, for Ayrton Senna it is a win-win situation.

749
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:55,117
It is difficult to make people, when you are pro-Senna that

750
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:57,713
when you say "I did not do it on purpose."

751
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,076
To be honest
I don't care so much, because

752
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,918
I promise you I did not do it on purpose.
But I did not open the door

753
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,833
which is very different,
especially in this corner.

754
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,789
But if you're not racing driver
knowing the corner, knowing the track

755
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,871
and knowing the chicane, you cannot judge.

756
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,391
It's a waste of time
to try to explain the situation.

757
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,552
It is my opinion. It was a race incident,

758
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:28,552
especially when you're fighting for the championship.

759
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,074
Knowing that if I wanted to open the door,

760
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:32,990
I could not make the chicane myself.

761
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,400
It was a little bit less than not yielding.
The level of aggression

762
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:43,188
that caused the cars to collide.

763
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,474
Which was, let's say, motor racing.

764
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,474
But really it was what unfolded that was so wrong.

765
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:24,552
Nannini passes.

766
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,474
Nannini is now in the lead.

767
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:32,992
Senna is still in the pits.

768
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,389
Senna is back on track,
but he is far behind Nannini.

769
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,152
Catching up is almost impossible.

770
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,391
It's all or nothing,
five laps to go.

771
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,949
It will be a suicidal race for Senna,
if he decides to try anything.

772
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:53,070
Then Prost saw Ayrton return to the race

786
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:31,590
Visibly moved,

787
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,034
He raises his visor
and wipes away a tear.

788
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,952
It is a fantastic victory.

789
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:41,514
I have never seen anything like it.

790
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,878
I went back to the pits,

791
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,431
and I saw Ayrton,
pushed by the marshals and start again.

792
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:54,672
Obviously I was not happy,

793
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,831
and that's it I went into the garage,
I had a very strong argument with Ron

794
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,112
and that's it.

795
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,199
Yes No, not ...

796
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,396
You have not gone before the control tower?

797
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,277
Garage. Or not.

798
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,032
According to me you went first to the tower.

799
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,398
Maybe to the tower.

800
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,471
Hello, you discussed with Ron at the tower.

801
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:22,076
The tower, yes, because Ron was already in the tower

802
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,630
and we had a strong argument there. But never,

803
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:28,836
at no situation
I was, for example, in the tower

804
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,639
with Mr. Balestre alone.

805
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:34,836
That did not happen. But I read that many many times.

806
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,797
We had the argument,

807
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,317
I did not even enter the race control.

808
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:44,311
Maybe in 20 minutes.

809
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,913
Fuckin' hell.

810
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,478
A cup of tea?

811
00:58:48,032 --> 00:58:50,652
There was no podium celebration

STEWARDS OFFICE

816
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,552
As the wait was prolonged, the more people feared
that the decision was becoming political.

817
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:32,355
The decision taken by the
team of FIA Commissioners

818
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,630
at the Grand Prix of Japan

819
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:38,757
is to exclude the number one car
and its driver, Ayrton Senna,

820
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,876
from the final outcome of the race.

821
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,958
After the race, a giant screen has
repeatedly shown the incident

822
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:49,873
and everything that happened to
enable Senna's return to the track.

823
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,119
After reviewing these images,
race officials have concluded

824
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,672
that Senna failed to use the
chicane to resume racing

825
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,547
Senna has infringed Article 56
of the FIA regulations.

826
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,233
You are the world champion, Alain?

827
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,514
Apparently, yes.

828
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,713
I was not 100% sure.
I know the regulation

829
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,873
but you never know
how it's going to be interpreted.

830
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,635
But to be very honest,
I am quite happy to leave,

831
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,672
Because I think it's become absolutely impossible to work with Ayrton.

832
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,594
And that's a good end for the Championship.

833
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,958
What I'd like to do now

834
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:55,516
is show you some footage
which I think is quite relevant

835
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,552
because we're told you can't use escape roads to rejoin the race.

REPLAY AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 1981

837
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,715
Escape roads are not for escaping through.
They're in fact for stopping in,

838
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,916
turning round
and going out of.

839
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:15,271
Very important to remember
that there were no exclusions

840
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,914
No penalties. No disqualifications.

841
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:23,235
And for that, he's excluded from the Japanese Grand Prix?

842
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,358
Where is the consistency? It can't be right.

843
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,228
That was the first time that a team has done an appeal

844
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,757
and request against its own driver.

845
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:42,827
I was in this kind of mood where, honestly

846
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,112
I wanted to be world champion,
but you know that anything was possible

847
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:52,318
and looking at your own team going so far,

848
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,114
I did not know what could happen.

849
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,039
Prost was very very political.

850
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:03,994
I think it's probably fair to say

851
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:07,356
that he was with several teams during his career.

852
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,318
and, I don't think his relationship with any of them ended happily.

853
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,315
Alain, you say that you took a normal racing line

854
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,119
But, I'd like to put it to you that from the aerial pictures,

855
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:21,235
you looked as if you turned in quite early.

856
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,914
It wasn't a normal line at all.

857
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:28,072
I won 39 races
and now three championships

858
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,835
Do you think I would do something like this on purpose?

859
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:36,757
I had already turned from the corner

860
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,753
maybe a little earlier, if you want,
but that was my corner.

861
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:46,751
FIA HEADQUARTERS - PARIS
The Court of Appeals declares

862
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,117
a six-month license suspension for Senna.

863
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:57,748
A warning not only to Ayrton
Senna but for all the drivers,

864
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,956
And a fine of $100,000.

865
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,112
While he is one of the best drivers in the world,

866
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,512
you have no right to
cause stupid accidents.

867
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:12,918
The whole affair has been treated

868
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,034
is like I have total responsibility for everything that took place there

869
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:22,994
I was blamed for everything
and I was penalized for everything.

870
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,195
I was treated like a criminal.

871
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,231
And this is totally unacceptable.

872
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,036
They took the Championship away from him

873
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:34,994
and they suspended his license, for a period.

874
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,588
To me it was the worst use of power, political power

875
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,871
in my fifteen years on the Formula One circuit.

876
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,190
And Ayrton would never forget it.

877
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,675
Alain Prost, somewhere, I know,
deep down inside, was ashamed of it.

878
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,030
And the rule was actually changed later,

879
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:04,152
to allow what Ayrton did, to become legal, because of it.

880
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,994
That was quite a profound moment for Ayrton

881
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:19,317
because Balestre had behaved
even worse than Prost.

882
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,474
VIVIANE SENNA

883
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,757
He even thought about giving
up Formula One racing.

884
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,197
I left him alone for awhile, y'know.

885
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,315
VOICE OF RON DENNIS
MCLAREN TEAM MANAGER

886
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:36,757
Then, gently persuaded him
that if you are true to your values

887
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,871
if you believe that your values are, correct values,

888
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,311
then walking away from the dark forces

889
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,835
you'll face in life
just doesn't become an option.

890
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,034


891
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,478
In the 1990 season he came back wiser,
the team is harmonious,

892
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:14,233
Prost has gone out of McLaren to Ferrari

893
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,717
and Senna is in a perfect position
to compete for the title.

894
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,918
All drivers aspire towards their limits.

895
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,148
My limit is different from that of Prost.
This is the reality.

896
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:33,798
Instead of trying
to improve his own capacity,

897
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:37,112
he found it easier to attack me.

898
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,394
Ayrton has a small problem.
He believes that he can't kill himself,

899
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,550
because he believes in God and things like this.

900
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:47,518
I think it is very dangerous
for the other drivers.

901
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:51,518
The fact that I believe in God,
the fact that I have faith in God,

902
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,429
is not to say that I am immortal,

903
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:02,277
It does not mean that I am immune from
danger, as has been said.

904
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,434
I'm afraid of hurting me
just like everyone else,

905
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,431
especially driving in Formula One,
where the threat is constant.

906
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:13,594
SPANISH GRAND PRIX
30th SEPTEMBER 1990

907
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,550
MARTIN DONNELLY
LOTUS

908
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,998
Is that him?

909
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,349
Who is it?

910
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,748
Martin Donnelly.

911
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,996
I was in the pits.
The practice was stopped.

912
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,998
I hear from different people
there was an accident. It was Donnelly.

913
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,668
It was bad.
It was too bad. It was a disaster.

914
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:59,315
And I decided to go to the place
to see myself.

915
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,552
A million things went through my mind.
In the end,

916
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:24,150
I realized I was not going to give up my passion.

917
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,869
Having just seen what I had seen

918
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,717
And I had to put myself together

919
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,072
And walk up, go to the racing car and do it again

920
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,351
and do it again, and do it even better than before.

921
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:49,434
Because that was the way to kind of cover that impact it had on me.

922
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:54,911
I was just not ready to give up.
As much as I was scared to continue

923
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,873
I was not ready to give up
my aim, my target, my objective,

924
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,271
my passion, my dream, my life.
This is my life.

925
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,118
AYRTON SENNA 1:19.844
POLE POSITION

926
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:53,194
As far as I hear he is out of danger, life danger

927
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,353
which is a lot, considering the accident.

928
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,877
And as it happened to him,
it can happen to any of us.

929
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,871
There are somethings that you can calculate

930
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,270
but there are things that are unexpected.

931
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:09,351
And those unexpected things are the most dangerous ones

932
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,112
like it happened to him today.

933
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:24,114
I hope we don't see those things in the future

934
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:33,797
JAPANESE GRAND PRIX
21st OCTOBER 1990

935
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:37,192
Amazingly,
for the third time in a row

936
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,317
the championship hinged on the race in Japan.

937
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:46,636
But this time, if Prost didn't finish, Ayrton would be champion.

938
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:51,238
Gentlemen, good morning.

939
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:55,359
The number of laps from green light to checkered flag will be 53 laps

940
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:56,509
PRE-RACE MEETING FOR DRIVERS

941
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,997
Dangerous behavior and / or dangerous maneuvers

942
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:02,951
will be investigated immediately

943
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:05,747
and may lead to the suspension of your license

944
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,310
for one or more Formula One World Championship events

945
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,831
Any questions?

946
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,112
There was a big fuck up last year with Ayrton.

947
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:17,269
NELSON PIQUET
WORLD CHAMPION 1981, 1983, 1987

948
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:18,798
Why have to repeat the same thing?

949
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,073
The safe thing,

950
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,550
is if you take the chicane,
is the stewards stop you.

951
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,309
When no traffic, let you go.

952
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:30,789
If you have to turn around and go back toward

953
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:35,154
against another car that's dangerous!

954
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,833
Okay.

955
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:39,673
Does everybody feel that way?

956
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,149
Yes.
Yes.

957
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,037
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

958
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:50,198
I can't stand it. I can't stand it. This is a joke.

959
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,476
After what happened last year,
it's a joke, this situation

960
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,832
You just proved here, I said nothing, and you see somebody raising point.

961
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,070
and you see everybody agrees.
Last year was really bad for me.

962
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,154
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I can not stay.

963
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:14,788
The story down in the pit lane and on the grid is one of tension

964
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,634
With the world championship up for grabs,
everyone is extremely tense.

965
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,951
Ayrton Senna actually
walked out of the drivers meeting today

966
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:23,354
He thinks that the pole position should be

967
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:25,795
on the left-hand side of the grid, not on the right.

968
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:30,034
If the inside was clean,
inside for sure is better

969
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:34,158
But it is dirty. The outside is better
Like Hungary, or like uhh..

970
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,918
The racing line is the line where the cars most normally drive

VOICE OF JOHN BISIGNANO
ESPN COMMENTATOR

972
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:42,270
It is the fastest line around the track

973
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:47,349
It's really important to have pole position on the racing line

974
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:53,519
If you are on the opposite side
you are on a part of the track that is rarely used,

975
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,748
and has half the grip.

976
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:58,311
If you are second, you would get away better

977
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,032
not on the inside

978
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:02,350
because inside there is no grip.

979
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:04,757
We will have a look.

980
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,954
Yes, please.

981
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:10,908
But would the Chief Steward, would the FIA, would Balestre, agree?

982
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,670
Ayrton Senna will be in pole position for tomorrow's Japanese Grand Prix.

983
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,636
Prost was second fastest.

VOICE OF RON DENNIS
MCLAREN TEAM MANAGER

985
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,868
Pole position was his

986
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,395
and then suddenly, pole position
was mysteriously

987
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:47,792
moved to the dirty side of the circuit
which he felt was unjust.

988
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,555
VOICE OF AYRTON SENNA

989
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,958
That decision, influenced by Balestre.

990
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:53,677
I know that. We know that.

991
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,194
I was fucked, many times by the system.

992
01:12:57,279 --> 01:12:59,873
I told myself: Today, there is no way.

993
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,632
"Today has to be my way.

994
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,234
"I don't care what happens, it has to be my way."

995
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,957
GREEN LIGHT

996
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,712
And Senna sprints away

997
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,951
but Alain Prost takes the lead!
Exactly!

998
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,676
Senna is trying to go through on the inside

999
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,069
And a collision!

1000
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,387
Clashed.

1001
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,476
Senna has been hit.

1002
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,198
Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna
have come together again

1003
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,193
and they are both off the race track! This is unbelievable!

1004
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,916
If the race continues,
the title would have been decided

1005
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,671
I wonder if we'll see
the red flag.

1006
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,795
We haven't seen any yet

1007
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,189
So it looks as if the race will continue.

1008
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:52,395
The Championship is over.

1009
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,472
Ayrton Senna
is the world champion of 1990.

1010
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,475
That's a very sad way for this year's world championship to finish.

1011
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:18,836
I circled around the back of the tower

1012
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,117
and I was standing right in an illegal place

1013
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,029
at the pit entrance.

1014
01:14:26,119 --> 01:14:30,954
And as soon as Ayrton crossed the line into the pits,

1015
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:34,475
I came over the wall

1016
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,034
and in my ear,

1017
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:38,395
All the way back in Bristol, Connecticut they were saying:

1018
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:40,515
"Ask him about the incident"
"Ask him about the crash"

1019
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,159
"Ask him about who did what to whom."

1020
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:46,837
Can you tell us what happened
on the first lap, Ayrton?

1021
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,439
Well, unfortunately we touched in the first corner,

1022
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,118
AYRTON SENNA BRA
F1 WORLD CHAMPION 1990

1023
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,878
when we were fighting for the lead,
and we both went off

1024
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,359
You think that's because the pole position

1025
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:57,398
was on the wrong side of the track?
You wanted it changed.

1026
01:14:57,479 --> 01:15:01,268
Absolutely! You break your *** to be on pole

1027
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:03,555
and then they put you
on the wrong side of the circuit

1028
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,595
How do you feel about being world champion?

1029
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:07,912
It's not a bad feeling at all is it?

1030
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,557
Congratulations.

1032
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:18,438
What was very clear was, Ayrton when he got back,

1033
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:24,628
his body language, his mannerisms,
showed that he was in massive conflict

1034
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,796
He was certainly not proud of himself.

1035
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,275
Certainly not revelling in the fact that

1036
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:36,351
this had determined the
World Championship.

FIA AWARDS
PARIS 1990

1039
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,639
Welcome the world champion,
Ayrton Senna.

1040
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,431
He knew I was right with him,

1041
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,511
He moved to the inside line,
going towards the first corner.

1042
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,557
I was chasing him then, and he opened a gap.

1043
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:05,555
And knowing me, like he does know,

1044
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,315
he must realize that if there was a gap, I will try to overtake him.

1045
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,109
Okay. Let me ask you
another difficult question.

1046
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,634
If I were to count back all the world champions,

1047
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,788
JACKIE STEWART
FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPION 1969, 1971, 1973

1048
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:22,876
the number of times they had made contact with other drivers

1049
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,350
that you, in the last 36, 48 months,

1050
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:30,069
have been in contact with more other cars and drivers

1051
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,469
than they might have done in total.

1052
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:36,631
I find amazing for you to make such a question, Stewart.

1053
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:40,632
because you are very experienced
and you know a lot about racing.

1054
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,917
And you should know
that by being a racing driver

1055
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,389
you are under risk, all the time.

1056
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,512
By being a racing driver
means you are racing with other people.

1057
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,478
And if you no longer go for a gap that exists,

1058
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,198
you are no longer a racing driver.

1059
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:59,351
Because we are competing.
We are competing to win.

1060
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,911
And the main motivation to all of us,
is to compete for victory

1061
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,149
It's not to come third, fourth, fifth or sixth.

1062
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,230
But hasn't that always been the case?

1063
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:11,073
But I think it's all irrelevant. All you are saying Jackie,

1064
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,797
is irrelevant.

1065
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,634
Because I am a driver that won more races than anybody in the past three years.

1066
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:20,429
I'm a driver that has been on pole position more than anybody in history.

1067
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,751
And I'm a driver that won two titles in the last three years.

1068
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,912
I don't think ... How... I cannot comprehend how

1069
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,197
how you can try to turn things around

1070
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:32,953
To say that I've been involved in more accidents than anybody

1071
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:34,792
Because that is not true as well!

1072
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,750
The rivalry between Ayrton and Prost

1073
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,154
is the biggest rivalry I've ever seen in sports

1074
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:45,997
throughout my career. That was over 38 years
in Formula One,

1075
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,278
I was involved in football,
World Championships, Olympic Games

1076
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:52,078
and worked in many other areas,

1077
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:55,835
but I've never seen a rivalry
similar to that between Prost and Ayrton.

1078
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:01,198
It was a rivalry involving everything.

1079
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:04,356
There were criticisms,
especially by Prost,

1080
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:07,750
in relation to the behavior of Ayrton as a person.

1081
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:12,359
But he really was a pure product of kart racing.

1082
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,908
He brought to Formula One
a way of racing that,

1083
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:22,353
until that time, was particular to karts,

1084
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:28,715
Which was a very no compromise kind of approach to racing.

1085
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,717
Head to head against your rivals

1086
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,993
and physical contact between the machines
was okay, was fine in karts

1087
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:40,797
It was safe enough.

1088
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:48,759
But to bring that into cars was something quite different.

1089
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:54,917
And I think that was one of the things
that shocked his slightly older rivals.

1090
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,318
There weren't used to that.

1091
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:02,314
The kind of etiqutte they had grown up with was different.

1092
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:07,029
It was rooted in the belief
that you didn't make contact,

1093
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:08,519
with another rival's car,

1094
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,158
because if you did that you're likely to die.

1095
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,399
Two of the greatest champions
in the history of Formula One

1096
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:14,993
ended up in the sand.
Championship ruined.

1097
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:18,277
They accuse each other,
but Prost was the hardest.

1098
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:19,917
His reaction was violent.

1099
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,555
I wanted to punch him in the
face, but I was so disgusted

1100
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,756
that I did not succeed.

1101
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,353
It makes me feel sick.

1102
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:35,231
Senna versus Prost which went on for a couple of seasons more

1103
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:37,350
was just absolutely wonderful
for Formula One.

1104
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,631
The television ratings improved.
Everything went up.

1105
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,073
People talked about it.

1106
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:48,350
It was controversial,
shocking and fascinating.

1107
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,717
The success of the sport also grew y'know.

1108
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,154
Even commercially.
Bernie Ecclestone was very clever

1109
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,800
the way he distributed television.

1110
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,109
But, keep an audience you need personalities

1111
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:04,590
and of course the Prost-Senna story was a big hit.

1112
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:08,038
And Ayrton became very famous
outside the sport

1113
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:12,033
through the impact of Formula One
on TV.

1114
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:22,238
I feel sorry for the people because ...

1115
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,234
Sent her away.

1116
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:28,631
They are nice people
and it is not nice to see them being pushed away.

1117
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,557
I feel so sorry.

1118
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,229
In Brazil, it was very different.

1119
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:44,073
The People were unhappy
under their regime ruling them.

1120
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,159
Poverty was just, desperate.

1121
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:52,273
So his appeal there at a hard time was extraordinary.

1122
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,555
The situation in Brazil
was very negative and depressing.

VIVIANE SENNA
AYRTON'S SISTER

1124
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:04,238
But many times,
when Ayrton won,

1125
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:08,796
instead of trying to hide
his Brazilian origins, as others did,

1126
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:12,270
he did the opposite,
waving the flag of his country.

1127
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,199
He took it inside the car every Sunday.

1128
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:20,274
He was an inspiration to people.
That's why they loved him so much.

1129
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,719
Attending a Brazillian Grand Prix

1130
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,158
There's nothing like it.

1131
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:35,273
And when Ayrton Senna is on top

1132
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:41,310
it is just an out-of-body experience to be involved

1133
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:43,632
to be in the paddock, to be on the grid.

1134
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,914
People ask me:

1135
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:50,273
"What was your greatest experience
in your fifteen years on the Formula One circuit? "

1136
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:53,158
And they're amazed that I say:

1137
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,356
"The first time
that the race went back to Sao Paulo,

1138
01:21:57,439 --> 01:21:59,237
'To Interlagos. "

1139
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,154
Senna is on pole position

1140
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,274
The start of the race

1141
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,671
and there's 300,000 Brazilian fans, at that circuit,

1142
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:15,189
singing "OlÃ©, olÃ©, olÃ©! Senna, Senna!"

1143
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:21,797
When the engines started, you could not hear the engines, right next to you

1144
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:27,594
for the sound of the fans, singing his praise.

1145
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,912
Singing with love, for his accomplishments

1146
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,637
and for their love of the person.

1147
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:38,273
He wanted to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.

1148
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:41,113
He wanted to win his own Grand Prix

1149
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:45,273
and here it is, seven years into his career

1150
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,591
and he has not won the most meaningful race

1151
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,390


1152
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:01,872

01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,152
Red light. Green light.

1158
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,877
A good start.

1159
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:21,394
Come on, Senna!

1160
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,829

Lap 54/67

1162
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,069
Ayrton pulled out a lead.

1163
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:41,153

01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:51,395
It's raining. It must stop.

1167
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:56,872
And then the gearbox jammed

1168
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,475
and he was faced with several laps to go

1169
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,755
only having a sixth gear.

He could no longer drive it.

But he had already tried many times
to win the Brazilian Grand Prix

1175
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:22,556
and found a special force within himself.

1176
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:35,398
The last corner.
And Senna crosses the line.

1177

01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,875
He won and then fainted.

REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR

1188
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,189
It was his most heroic moment.

1189
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,916
Because of the tremendous physical effort,

1190
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,515
I had muscle spasms of my
shoulder and neck.

1191
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,430
The pain was tremendous.

1192
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,676
The physical and mental stress
this weekend was unheard of.

1193
01:26:24,039 --> 01:26:25,757
But could there be only one result.

1194
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,877
I finished the race with no more energy.

1195
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,158
What's wrong?

1196
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:36,840
The shoulders, the shoulders.

1197
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:40,752
It's just my shoulders.

1198
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:46,435
Come here, Dad. Come on.

1199
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:48,435
Come here.

1200
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,431
Touch floor.

1201
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,229
Do not touch me.

1202
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:58,957
Quiet, Ayrton.

1203
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:01,872
Don't touch me.

1204
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,069
Need help?

1205
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:05,469
Bring the flag for me

1206
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,518
Today, I fought hard.

1207
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:13,275
I wanted to finish the race
and finish in first position,

1208
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:15,715
because He is the greatest

1209
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,309
and He will give me this
race after all.

1210
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,038
That's what happened.

1211
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:23,469
It is God who gave me this race
and I'm happy.

1212
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,515
It was thrilling.

1213
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,552
All hail the Brazilian Senna
for his victory. Congratulations.

1214
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,109
I thank all of Brazil.
I thank all the fans.

1215
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:25,795
This weekend I felt so
much warmth around me

1216
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,872
that we could not do anything but win.

1217
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,791
It could not have been any other way.

1218
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,029
And we did.

SENNA FAMILY HOUSE, SAO PAULO

1220
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,917
Life can be very difficult in Brazil.
You have...

1221
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,197
In Brazil you have all the extremes.
You have the fantastic nature.

1222
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:19,273
You can have all the good material things
that money can buy.

1223
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,354
But at the same time,
You have lots of problems.

1224
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:28,435
Social problems, poverty.
Some violence, as a consequence.

1225
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:30,752
I try to help

1226
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,917
a little bit, for children

1227
01:29:37,399 --> 01:29:43,953
Ayrton was so well known in Brazil

VIVIANE SENNA
AYRTON'S SISTER

1229
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:47,753
there were a lot of people asking for help

1230
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,872
for personal problems. Sometimes hospitals

1231
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,838
and charities sought his
support and donations.

1232
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:02,074
Ayrton gave donations and tried to work things out.

1233
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,314
But did not want to make random donations.

1234
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:14,037
He wanted to develop a whole thing,
something organized and structured

1235
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,996
to help Brazil, especially the children.

1236
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,996
Ayrton in '91 was in great form.

VOICE OF JOHN BISIGNANO
ESPN COMMENTATOR

1238
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:37,713
I think it was his strongest year.

1239
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:42,078
He won seven races,
Constantly on pole position.

1240
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,720
His intensity was every bit as high as ever.

1241
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:53,795
But there just seemed to be a further...wisdom.

1242
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,871
Further bit of growth.

1243
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:05,037
MEXICAN GRAND PRIX
14th JUNE 1991

1244
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:21,435
But then the car bit him hard.

1245
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,510
For the first time, he really thought
he could be hurt in a Formula One car.

1246
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:41,832
A neurological examination

1247
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,954
VOICE OF PROFESSOR SID WATKINS
F1 DOCTOR

1248
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:45,310
detected the chest, and the
blood pressure, and the abdomen

1249
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:46,912
and the limbs.

1250
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,037
-How do you feel about this..?
-He's fine.

1251
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:53,237
-No problems to worry about?
-No. That's all. No.

1252
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:56,509
VOICE OF PROFESSOR SID WATKINS
F1 DOCTOR

1253
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:00,877
It's the deepest personal relationship
I've ever had with any driver

1254
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,555
Whenever I got to the circuit and ran into Senna

1255
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,394
he was usually being interviewed
or surrounded by people.

1256
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:14,429
As soon as he saw me his face would always light up,
in a beautiful grin.

1257
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:17,997
It had wonderful humility,

1258
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:21,510
which is not common among racing drivers

1259
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,796
-Okay.
-It was a pleasure.

1260
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:28,792
Be careful.

1261
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,791
You still have so much to do.

1262
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,471
Yes, important.

1263
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:39,555
Questions? Yes

1264
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,675
GERMAN GRAND PRIX
28th JULY 1991

1265
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,635
We talked about the chicanes
and the barriers

1266
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,109
that we have there with the tyres.

1267
01:32:48,199 --> 01:32:49,792
You happen to hit those tyres

1268
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,514
it is very likely the tyres throw you up in the air

1269
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,914
and you end up rolling

1270
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,911
That's what happened with me in Mexico

1271
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:00,158
and that can happen here with other people.

1272
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:03,438
I agree that for the moment

1273
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,079
is not the ideal thing to have done.

1274
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,354
ROLAND BRUYNSERAEDE
RACE DIRECTOR

1275
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,274
The President has told yesterday
with Mr. Mosley.

1276
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:14,670
No, no, no.
Forget Mr. Mosley.

1277
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,591
And he has...

1278
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,994
Forget it.

1279
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:20,354
Okay. The president of the FISA...

1280
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,716
No, forget the president.

1281
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,759
We speak of the issue
raised by Mr. Senna,

1282
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,878
what we do today
For the race.

1283
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:34,234
For the race, we cannot do anything

1284
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:37,033
I think it's better to not have those tyres there

1285
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:41,273
I happened to lose the braking point in the first chicane yesterday

1286
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:45,194
Let me finish. Let me finish.

1287
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:48,630
As I went straight. It was blocked you know

1288
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,835
and I couldn't turn back.

1289
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,675
If we remove the tires,
we must place the cones.

1290
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,157
Yeah, okay.
In that way, there is a run-off there

1291
01:33:59,239 --> 01:34:00,309
Yes

1292
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:05,313
No, you must restart with the same point.

1293
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:08,710
Because you must respect the distance of the race

1294
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,313
We cannot come back.

1295
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:15,554
I'm sorry,
but this regulation.

1296
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,472
It is written in the regulation.
We got the letter yesterday.

1297
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,390
Page three.

1298
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:27,390
Here. The last two paragraphs.

1299
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,438
Very good, penalty for her.

1300
01:34:39,239 --> 01:34:41,470
Jean-Marie, is the same thing.

1301
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:45,234
No problem, Ayrton.
No problem.

1302
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:48,436
Whatever is the decision, it is the right decision to make

1303
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,509
You must understand.

1304
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,988
The best decision is my decision.

1305
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,512
I have a feeling for that.

1306
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,751
No, because you don't know my decision.

1307
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,952
It's the best, everytime, my decision.

1308
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:05,512
And my decision is

1309
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,832
Democratic vote. Only the drivers.

1310
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,194
By hand.

1311
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:23,952
Who are in favor we replace the
tyre by the cones?

1312
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:26,269
Raise your hand.

1313
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:29,828
Stop.

1314
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,189
Against?

1315
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:36,193
Abstain? Everybody agree, okay.

1316
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:40,796
Immediately, the wall will replace the tyre by the cone, okay.

1317
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:44,671
3 HOURS LATER

1318
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,997
Alain, what happened going into that chicane?

1319
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:56,550
I tried to overtake Senna. It was ...

1320
01:35:57,239 --> 01:36:01,073
Blocked me during the whole race, not very correct.

1321
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,556
I think everyone knows Prost by now.

1322
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,996
He always complain either by the car, or the tyres,

1323
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,948
the team, or the mechanics, or the fuel,
or the other drivers or the circuit.

1324
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:15,600
There's always somebody else blame, it's never his fault.

1325
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,748
Yes, no problem.

1326
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,673
So I have nothing to lose.
I can't win the championship,

1327
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:26,356
but if I find him again, the same way,
I push him out.

1328
01:36:29,079 --> 01:36:32,310
Prost was sacked from Ferrari
because he had criticized the car.

1329
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:34,152
VOICE OF RICHARD WILLIAMS
SPORTS JOURNALIST, THE GUARDIAN

1330
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:37,231
The only thing he could do, really, was take a year off

1331
01:36:37,319 --> 01:36:39,470
telling everybody he was on a sabbatical.

1332
01:36:43,159 --> 01:36:47,551
My favorite part of a Grand Prix
was the starting grid

1333
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:53,707
and used to do the pit walk
and walk down the center of the grid

1334
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,679
and give an update on every team that was on the grid.

1335
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,471
Now, I don't know if it was because

1336
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,518
I was getting closer to the front of the grid

1337
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,159
or close to the start of the race

1338
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:09,231
but I swear to you, as a fact,

1339
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,707
when I stood next to Ayrton Senna's car

1340
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,157
at certain times, the hair would stand up...on my arms.

1341
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:23,153
There was an energy, there was a force,

1342
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:25,515
There was a spirit in that cockpit

1343
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,435
that you could not find
around any other car on that grid.

1344
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:34,755
It was absolutely electrifying.

1345
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,996
JAPANESE GRAND PRIX
19th OCTOBER 1991

1346
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,636
If I finish second place,
The championship will be over.

1347
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,914
If Mansell does not win,

1348
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,355
then, it's almost certain that
the championship will be over as well.

1349
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:24,354
LAP 9 OF 53

1350
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:28,155
Mansell tries to overtake, but he goes straight on.

1351
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,833
Mansell goes straight on!

1352
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,515
The Championship is over.
Mansell cannot get out of the gravel trap.

1353

AYRTON SENNA
THREE-TIME WORLD CHAMPION

1354
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:41,431
Ayrton Senna of Brazil,
three-time Formula One World Champion!

1355
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:46,350
A lifetime dedicated to this moment

1356
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,956
by a genius of international sport.

1357
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:54,077
Three-time world champion
and many other titles ahead of him.

1358
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:56,195
And only 31 years of age.

1359
01:38:56,279 --> 01:38:59,954
33 wins, three world titles.

1360
01:39:00,039 --> 01:39:04,908
Breaking record after record.
He celebrates as only Senna can do.

1361
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:10,511
The third world title puts Senna
among the greatest of all time.

1362
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,436
It is very special for me.

1363
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,038
Thank you so much.

1364
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,389
SAO PAULO
5th NOVEMBER 1991

1365
01:39:42,039 --> 01:39:47,478
I followed Senna, walked with him

1366
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,274
on the streets of many countries around the world,

1367
01:39:52,359 --> 01:39:57,194
especially to get to the circuits,
such as in Japan,

1368
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:01,949
where there is a one kilometer walk to reach the hotel

1369
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,675
and to reach the circuit you
must cross an amusement park

1370
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:12,029
And I thought: "How can a person
be worshipped in this way?"

1371
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,158
It was a worship without limits.

1372
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,716
I kissed the hands of Senna, the left hand
of Senna, three-times world champion.

1373
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:41,270
I want to Senna.
I want to hug him and kiss him.

1374
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:43,350
I have got a box with
photos and newspaper articles.

1375
01:40:43,479 --> 01:40:45,037
Everything you can imagine.

1376
01:40:45,159 --> 01:40:47,548
He is the only good thing in Brazil, right?

1377
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:53,269
After that third world championship
I saw another Senna.

1378
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:58,952
He was very satisfied, very confident.
He knew the sport better than ever.

1379
01:40:59,039 --> 01:41:02,873
He had saw with real eyes
for the good and the bad

1380
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,230
and he still loved it, as much as anyone in the paddock.

1381
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:14,707
It is a wonderful party.

1382
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,917
Anything goes. What matters is happiness.

1383
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:20,155
Have you spoken about Formula One today?

1384
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:23,755
Formula One is too rigid.
Today is Carnival.

1385
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:34,432
Have any of your girls
ever told you: "Faster, Ayrton?

1386
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,078
Yes

1387
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:45,350
Ayrton acheiving the third world title

1388
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:48,829
was the culmination of a script
he had written for himself

1389
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,671
well before entering Formula One,

1390
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:54,115
because he knew he could do it
and could do even more.

1391
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:58,229
The great idol of sport in Brazil.

1392
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:02,755
With the third title, he became
the world's great sporting idol.

1393
01:42:10,279 --> 01:42:13,908
There is a great desire in me on improving.

1394
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,752
Getting better. Better makes me happy.

1395
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:22,470
In retirement I feel I am slowing down my learning process

1396
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:26,234
my learning curve is getting flatter, whatever

1397
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:28,880
Then, it doesn't make me very happy.

1398
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:35,519
And that applies not only as a professional,
as a racing driver but as a man.

1399
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,153
Of course,

1400
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:44,192
I shall have a lot more to learn as a man
than as a racing driver,

1401
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:47,511
because my career could last not many years

1402
01:42:48,199 --> 01:42:51,475
My life, hopefully, would still go for a long time.

1403
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:57,070
Maybe I'm only at the half of my life right now, so...

1404
01:42:59,159 --> 01:43:03,756
There is a lot to go, a lot to learn, a lot to do still, in life.

1405
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,435
And happiness will come when I feel complete, as a whole.

1406
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,878
which definitely I don't feel today.

1407
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,110
But I have plenty of time to fulfil that too.

1408
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,309


1409
01:43:28,279 --> 01:43:32,319
For the next season, the level
of competition was distorted

1410
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:36,029
by what was going on, technically,
with Williams' car.

1411
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:43,189
The car balanced itself.
Each corner was controlled by computer.

1412
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,992
All the driver had to do was put his right
foot down and go as fast as possible.

1413
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:53,708
So in a car without that you were
at a serious disadvantage.

1414
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:57,750
McLaren still well off
the Williams-Renault pace.

1415
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:01,509
with that result the three times
world champion Ayrton Senna

1416
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,319
has no chance of retaining his title.

1417
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:09,072
When you go into this sort

1418
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,273
electronic war

1419
01:44:16,439 --> 01:44:20,911
you can find yourself completely stuck.

1420
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:26,475
The eletronics do a given situation.

1421
01:44:27,079 --> 01:44:29,229
And no matter who you put in the car,

1422
01:44:29,319 --> 01:44:30,354
NIGEL MANSELL WORLD CHAMPION 1992

1423
01:44:30,439 --> 01:44:32,192
the eletronics will do the work and not the driver.

1424
01:44:33,319 --> 01:44:36,153
I do not think that is really what you want

1425
01:44:36,279 --> 01:44:39,828
to have a truly World Championship

1426
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,994
of drivers.

1427
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:44,552
The negotiations were lengthy

1428
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:47,438
and we still do not know who will be
Prost's teammate.

1429
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:50,034
The three-time world champion has signed

1430
01:44:50,119 --> 01:44:51,917
a two-year contract with Williams

1431
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,194
and during the week
will begin testing the car.

1432
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,710
The only thing I asked in the contract was that

1433
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,074
I did not want to be a teammate with Ayrton.

1434
01:45:01,159 --> 01:45:02,229
VOICE OF ALAIN PROST

1435
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:03,832
It has to be clear.

1436
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,194
And they have accepted that, very quickly

1437
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:08,037
saying no, it was not our intention.

1438
01:45:08,119 --> 01:45:10,554
This was the only thing I asked in the contract

1439
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,231
because I wanted to be world champion

1440
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:14,595
and do not want to lose the opportunity.

1441
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:20,030
I that when I drove the car in
September, in Estoril

1442
01:45:20,119 --> 01:45:22,997
and the first few laps, it was wet

1443
01:45:23,079 --> 01:45:25,229
and the car was absolutely unbelievable.

1444
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:29,154
I have never driven a car like this in my whole career.

1445
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:32,158
But, yeah.

1446
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:36,434
that car at that time was a good second, minimum a good second quicker.

1447
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,395
It is no secret that I'd been

1448
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,957
trying very hard to get some...

1449
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,796
some deal with Williams.

1450
01:45:49,079 --> 01:45:51,115
The situation is very complex.

1451
01:45:52,439 --> 01:45:53,667
It is...

1452
01:45:56,279 --> 01:45:58,953
It's not nice, it's not clear either.

1453
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,154
I'm pretty sure of one thing:

1454
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,152
I'm the one that has more to lose

1455
01:46:12,279 --> 01:46:19,238
Because I'm at an age near the peak of my career

1456
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:24,234
and the number of years in the career
of a Formula One driver is limited.

1457
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:31,829
So if I stop,
I'd lose out more than anyone else,

1458
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:35,270
at both professionally and personally.

1459
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,998
ADRIANE GALISTEU

1460
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:46,988


1461
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:55,596
In 1993, Ayrton drove
his car so brilliantly.

1462
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,591
For me, it was his best season.

1463
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,711
BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX

1464
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:01,194
EUROPEAN GRAND PRIX

1465
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:04,113
He did accomplish,
some of his greatest drives.

1466
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:05,269
MONACO GRAND PRIX

1467
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:09,194
even though he spent most of his time
looking at the back of that Williams,

1468
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:11,110
which was much faster than his.

1469
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:14,757
French racing driver Alain Prost

1470
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:18,389
has won the Formula One World Drivers Championship
for the fourth time ...

1471
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:21,789
Prost won the championship and duly retired,

1472
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,791
Thus getting out of the way.

1473
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:29,234
It seems like a little goodbye from you to McLaren.

1474
01:47:29,319 --> 01:47:32,630
Do you think it
was the last season for McLaren?

1475
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:35,154
I think so. I think it will be my last season.

1476
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,396
Now, I have a three-year contract

1477
01:47:37,479 --> 01:47:41,757
And then I had a moment in July

1478
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,832
I have a phonecall from Frank and said:

1479
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:50,277
"I need to talk to you.
I have a big pressure from Renault

1480
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,634
"And I need to talk to you about something."

1481
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:59,713
I said, 'Okay, Frank.
I think I know what you want to talk about.

1482
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:06,436
"But I'm on holiday."
And four or five days holiday.

1483
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,238
"If the Renault people
want to talk to me,

1484
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:11,275
"They come see me."

1485
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:15,353
And in fact he come himself, with his plan

1486
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:18,636
came to see me and trying to explain to me that

1487
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:26,237
Renault they are thinking of having Ayrton in the team with me there,

1488
01:48:26,359 --> 01:48:27,952
after.

1489
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:34,273
I said, 'Okay. That is not fair. We have a contract.

1490
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:38,677
"Just thinking of that is not fair, in the middle of the season.

1491
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,036
"Let's be fair. Lets wait a little bit"

1492
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:46,548
"A few races,
and we'll see what happens. "

1493
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:50,118
And in fact I'm going to tell you something that

1494
01:48:50,199 --> 01:48:53,158
nobody knows,
or very few people know,

1495
01:48:53,239 --> 01:48:56,676
but it is good to talk about this.

1496
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,838
I did not want to be a teammate with
Ayrton's again.

1497
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:07,671
I did not want to
continue with the perception of people saying:

1498
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:11,877
"Ayrton is the poor guy with the small car,

1499
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:17,878
"When Alain he wins it's normal,
because he has the best car. "

1500
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,671
Then I said:
"Well, you want Ayrton and I understand very well.

1501
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:26,310
"But you pay me for the contract for the next year, and I stop."

1502
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:27,912
I did not want to stop.

1503
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:33,596
I really did not want to stop.
But to see a situation going again,

1504
01:49:34,079 --> 01:49:36,912
especially in your own country,

1505
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,033
going in this direction again,

1506
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:44,873
I took my decision myself, very quickly.

1507
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,077
But I wanted to tell them just one month or two month later

1508
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:49,717
Because I wanted to be world champion.

1509
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,233
I did not want to lose the opportunity.

1510
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:54,038
When I saw that I was going to be world champion,

1511
01:49:54,119 --> 01:49:57,873
I said, "Okay. You pay the contract and I stop.
I've had enough. Okay? "

1512
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,791
That's what I had done. I did not want to stop.

1513
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,269
I stopped Formula One, only because of that.

1514
01:50:02,359 --> 01:50:04,668
Otherwise I wanted to continue.

1515
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:08,628
Ayrton fought so hard to win at
Monaco, but did not make it,

1516
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:14,118
fought to win at Suzuka, but did not make it,

1517
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:18,193
and when he was struggling to get into Williams

1518
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:21,590
he thought it was the end of his career.

1519
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,997
Sometimes it makes no sense ... We always say

1520
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:30,676
that we must fight for our ideals,
for what we want out of life.

1521
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:35,708
But sometimes the battles
do not bring the desired results.

1522
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:42,998
AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX
FINAL RACE OF 1993

1523
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:48,029
We try to do the best we can

1524
01:50:48,199 --> 01:50:49,599
Of course.

1525
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:53,797
We put behind us, what had happened.

1526
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:56,394
Sure.

1527
01:50:56,479 --> 01:50:57,673
Good.

1528
01:50:58,119 --> 01:51:02,796
Even without you saying anything, that was my goal.

1529
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,154
Yeah, okay.

1530
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:06,197
Even if we didn't talk at all

1531
01:51:06,279 --> 01:51:11,194
I wouldn't change ... I do exactly as I've always tried.

1532
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,029
VOICE OF MARK FOGARTY
F1 JOURNALIST

1533
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,475
Ayrton, what did Ron Dennis say to you
when you first stepped down from the car?

1534
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:26,757
It's never too late to change your mind.

1535
01:51:29,479 --> 01:51:32,949
But anyway he said he was happy for me and...

1536
01:51:33,079 --> 01:51:36,230
It's funny. That's what he told me as well.

1537
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:37,679
That's Ron.

1538
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:44,387
And I said you know, we must keep the good times, the good moments,

1539
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:47,916
and lets finish that way. Finish with the good things.

1540
01:51:56,680 --> 01:52:00,957
It was Senna's last race
for McLaren

1541
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:04,314
Prost's last race with Williams.

1542
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,712
And although nobody knew at that time,

1543
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:12,112
it was the last time
either of them were on the podium.

1544
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:19,555
AYRTON SENNA
WINNER AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX

1545
01:52:39,239 --> 01:52:43,028
But from this moment, where I am on the podium,

1546
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:45,475
close to him, on the same level,

1547
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,275
he has changed completely.

1548
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:52,997
He was really another person,

1549
01:52:53,079 --> 01:52:56,755
You have before this podium, and then you have after this podium.

1550
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,074
It was absolutely unbelievable.

1551
01:52:59,159 --> 01:53:01,548
It was a different person,

1552
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:04,675
different driver, in my opinion,

1553
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,149
and different personality.

1554
01:53:07,239 --> 01:53:10,152
He just behaved completely different.

1555
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,548
At the press conference,

1556
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:18,349
It was lucky that we had all the TVs waiting for us

1557
01:53:18,439 --> 01:53:24,037
but he was talking and speaking, asking question to me all the time

1558
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:28,318
talking as he had never talked before.

1559
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:32,559
It was certainly right to go to McLaren after Lotus.

1560
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,551
That was absolutely the right choice.

1561
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:40,556
And to pit himself against Alain Prost

1562
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:46,394
was a
very brave and very shrewd thing to do.

1563
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:49,636
Shrewd because he knew, or he believed,

1564
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,198
that he was better than Prost

1565
01:53:51,279 --> 01:53:54,396
and, by measuring himself against the man who was,

1566
01:53:54,479 --> 01:53:58,074
accepted as the yardstick of
Formula One at the time,

1567
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:04,155
he  could prove
for good and all, his own qualities.

1568
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:06,989
So, he could see that there was

1569
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:11,073
another team that had a better car
than McLaren,

1570
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:14,277
and the best car by a mile in the early '90s.

1571
01:54:14,359 --> 01:54:18,194
In '92 they walked the
World Championship with Nigel Mansell

1572
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:20,668
and in '93 they walked it with Prost.

1573
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,796
So he wanted to be in that car in '94.

1574
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:29,354
And that was where his instinct let him down.

1575
01:54:30,079 --> 01:54:35,313
Probably, given the known factors, given the parameters,

1576
01:54:35,399 --> 01:54:37,152
it was the right decision.

1577
01:54:37,239 --> 01:54:41,233
And you would go back and look at the conditions

1578
01:54:41,319 --> 01:54:44,676
and you make exactly the right decision.

1579
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:48,036
Exactly that decision.
It happened to be the wrong one.

1580
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,554
But there was no way he could have known that,

1581
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:56,878
until he actually stepped into the Williams car for the first time in '94.

1582
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,797
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna.

1583
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,073
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WILLIAMS DRIVERS

1584
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:11,996
Ayrton is arguably the best driver available,
the best driver currently racing.

1585
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:13,747
FRANK WILLIAMS

1586
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:14,795
The team is geared to being successful.

1587
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:20,238
All our partners,
investors and sponsors expect that of us.

1588
01:55:20,359 --> 01:55:24,319
Ayrton is therefore, the best piece of equipment, if you like,

1589
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:28,551
that we can put into the machine
to deliver, to our requirements.

1590
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,789
The lnternational Motorsports Federation

1591
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,952
has banned some of the controversial computer devices

1592
01:55:34,039 --> 01:55:37,032
which help drivers in Formula One motor racing.

1593
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:39,634
The ban is designed to stop the domination of the richest Formula One teams like

1594
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:40,708


1595
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,552
Williams-Renault, the World Champions.

1596
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,436
For Ayrton Senna, it is
a race against time.

1597
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,557
He has to attune himself to be an integral
part of the team and adapt to the new car.

1598
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:54,518
He says he is not yet comfortable.

1599
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:59,275
The car no longer has the electronic
components used last year.

1600
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:03,913
He is without traction control, special
brakes and active suspension.

1601
01:56:04,039 --> 01:56:09,716
The cars are much less stable

1602
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:13,872
without the electronically controlled suspension.

1603
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:17,918
As a result, they are more difficult to drive

1604
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:23,394
and it is very likely that more cars will leave the track.

1605
01:56:24,119 --> 01:56:28,716
So we might see more cars crashing,
giving more excitement to the audience.

1606
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,554
Also for us, as long as nothing happens to the drivers.

1607
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:35,234
Otherwise, it is not a good situation.

1608
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,871
Senna in second place.

1609
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,712
BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX
27th MARCH 1994

1610
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:42,314
Almost 8 seconds between them now.

1611
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:46,636
LAP 56 OF 71

1612
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,631
We are certainly not happy with the way,

1613
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,795
PATRICK HEAD
CHIEF ENGINEER WILLIAMS

1614
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,390
things are with the car, right as they are at this moment.

1615
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:10,630
The handling isn't particularly good.

1616
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:14,436
PACIFIC GRAND PRIX
17th APRIL 1994

1617
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,912
The cars weren't supposed to have any of the electronic aids

1618
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,309
that they had the previous year.

1619
01:57:21,399 --> 01:57:22,992
But Senna became convinced

1620
01:57:23,079 --> 01:57:26,197
that the Benetton being
driven by Michael Schumacher

1621
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:27,269
MICHAEL SCHUMACHER
BENNETTON FORD - WINNER

1622
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:30,033
who had won the first two races of the season,
had retained some of those,

1623
01:57:30,119 --> 01:57:31,154
FLAVIO BRIATORE
BENETTON TEAM MANAGER

1624
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:35,671
particularly, the traction control,
the thing that eliminates the wheelspin.

1625
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:43,676
It didn't stack up that he was being blown away by the Benetton.

1626
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:45,475
He wanted us to protest,

1627
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:46,675
VOICE OF FRANK WILLIAMS
TEAM MANAGER WILLIAMS

1628
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,838
but we didn't do it.

1629
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,877
SAN MARINO GRAND PRIX, IMOLA
APRIL 1994

1630
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:14,230
If he carried with him any emotion, going into that race,

1631
01:58:15,239 --> 01:58:18,835
that was different from previous races,

1632
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:22,673
it would probably had been the frustration

1633
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:28,038
of knowing that his principal rival
was driving a car

1634
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:31,675
with an illegal system on it.

1635
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:39,398
That would always incense his sense of fair play.

1636
01:58:41,319 --> 01:58:44,436
I would put anything that was

1637
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,670
abnormal about his behavior,

1638
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,671
down to that knowledge and belief.

1639
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:53,868
I must say that what he said,
because I cannot judge myself.

1640
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:58,238
but was convinced the
Benetton was cheating.

1641
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:04,630
He was very upset and he
was in big trouble because of that

1642
01:59:05,159 --> 01:59:11,076
Again, not very happy with the car...The performance of the car

1643
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:16,149
So he was obviously not very happy,

1644
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:20,310
saying that he could not find the motivation

1645
01:59:20,439 --> 01:59:25,069
Many times he told me:
"I can not be motivated against Michael,

1646
01:59:25,159 --> 01:59:26,877
"Against other drivers."

1647
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,190
It really like

1648
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:35,710
if he had lost his passion,

1649
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:39,712
he had problems with the car,
problems with the team, safety.

1650
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,359
maybe some small personal problems, possible.

1651
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:46,992
But he had lost his skilling.

1652
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:49,994
And that was very surprising.

1653
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:57,311
It was very apparent to me,
and to several other people aro und Ayrton.

1654
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:03,559
Josef, his trainer
and probably one of his closest friends,

1655
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,189
Sid Watkins, all three of us

1656
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,878
for different reasons,
very quickly formed the opinion

1657
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:15,872
that Ayrton quickly regretted leaving the team.

1658
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:24,551
Not specifically because of competitiveness or uncompetitiveness,

1659
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:31,597
but more because he didn't expect
to find himself in such a different culture,

1660
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:38,154
and one which was quite alien to the way he was.

1661
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:59,152
We are here starting from zero.
So basically, the championship starts here.

1662
02:00:59,239 --> 02:01:03,711
It's not a comfortable position to be in,
but that's the reality.

1663
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:08,715
You've won here three times already.
You really do need to make it four.

1664
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,471
I would love to.

1665
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:15,158
FRIDAY
29th APRIL 1994

1666
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:54,350
Senna was so nervous that weekend.
I had never seen him so tense.

1667
02:01:54,439 --> 02:01:55,838
REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR

1668
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:04,074
I never saw him smile
even for a moment.

1669
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:11,358
He maintained a bemused, bored, even a sad demeanour.

1670
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:20,150
It is the balance.

1671
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,230
It is unstable.

1672
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:30,069
The car has worsened.

1673
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,474
Is it generally one more balanced than the other?

1674
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:37,073
or is it constantly changing?

1675
02:02:37,399 --> 02:02:39,515
There's abit more understeer.

1676
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,990
In the first round, tended to understeer.

1677
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:48,479
Then, in the second, has changed abruptly.

1678
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:52,435
Oversteer and understeer?

1679
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:53,595
Yes

1680
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,511
Instead of mid-corner,

1681
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:58,829
it breakaways at the entrance

1682
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:02,592
When it's supposed to breakaway, it breaks more.

1683
02:03:10,039 --> 02:03:16,912
He was getting into a car, that was like kind of a unbroken code if you like.

1684
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:21,716
It had a lot of problems, a lot of vices.

1685
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:25,631
that needed to be worked on and ironed out.

1686
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:28,917
some of them seemed pretty fundamental.

1687
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,038
One of the thing that a driver hates, above all else

1688
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:36,795
is a car that changes its behavior in the middle of a corner.

1689
02:03:37,159 --> 02:03:39,798
There are two things,
oversteer and understeer.

1690
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:42,387
Oversteer is what we used to call the four-wheel drift, y'know.

1691
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:45,789
When you steer the car with the throttle and then

1692
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:49,677
and you turn the steering wheel to balance it.

1693
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:52,149
in such a way that you appear to be going in the opposite direction

1694
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:54,310
from where you want to go, but actually the car drifts

1695
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:56,230
slides around the corner.

1696
02:03:56,399 --> 02:03:59,948
Understeer is when
you have to put more steer in on than you expect.

1697
02:04:00,039 --> 02:04:02,189
to get round a corner.

1698
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:04,478
The worse thing... Most of the cars

1699
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:06,551
has the characteristic of one or the other,

1700
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:09,313
but really bad cars had both.

1701
02:04:09,399 --> 02:04:12,836
And they change from one to the other in the blink of an eye

1702
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,555
in the middle of a corner,
when you least want it to happen.

1703
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:21,548
And that's very very disturbing for a driver,
because it destroys his faith

1704
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:23,591
in the integrity of the car.

1705
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:28,037
And that's absolutely crucial,
to particularly Formula One,

1706
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,430
to developing,

1707
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:34,832
for the driver to develop, that complete trust

1708
02:04:35,079 --> 02:04:38,435
in the car's temperament and behaviour.

1709
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:41,270
And it was very clear in the beginning of the '94 season

1710
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:43,475
that Williams absolutely did not have that.

1711
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:47,439
It had the really unpleasant characteristic of changing its balance.

1712
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:51,838
And that takes a lot of sorting out.

1713
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:56,671
We say by the end of the season that Williams had sorted it out.

1714
02:04:57,199 --> 02:05:01,238
Damon Hill was winning races, challenging for the title.

1715
02:05:02,399 --> 02:05:05,789
And for the next season and the two seasons after that.

1716
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:09,872
in '96 and '97,
Williams won the title again

1717
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:13,114
because they had gone through that bad period.

1718
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:16,033
But Senna's arrival
coincided with that period

1719
02:05:16,199 --> 02:05:21,479
and I think that was very... that was very disturbing to him

1720
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:23,676
because he had gone there expecting something else.

1721
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,832
He had gone there expecting to walk into a championship winning car

1722
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,628
Instead of which he found himself with the serious job of

1723
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:34,029
helping the engineers

1724
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:39,198
purge the car of its vices and make it competitive again.

Do you know Ayrton
or should I introduce you?

1727

We met four years earlier. I already met him.

1728
02:05:51,239 --> 02:05:53,195
Knew him by name, or in person?

1729
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:58,631
I know him because I follow
Formula One and then we met in person.

1730
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,876
Why are you so nervous, then?

1731
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,470
When we stand next to a person like
him we always become emotional.

He's alright, he's alright
He is shocked, of course, but he's alright.

Yes

30th APRIL 1994

When I arrived at Imola

1743
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:23,472
And the first thing I see when the screen

1744
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:29,032
where he has recorded the... "Alain, we miss you."

1745
02:07:29,159 --> 02:07:32,435
Or maybe: "We miss you, Alain."

1746
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:36,034
"To my friend, Alain. We miss you."
Or: "I miss you."

1747
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:40,393
I'm very happy.

1748
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:46,355
Honestly, it's maybe the best thing he has done, to me.

1749
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:51,875
Because this message is very important.

1750
02:07:54,039 --> 02:07:57,112
Because..not only because it happened, unfortunately,

1751
02:07:57,199 --> 02:08:00,271
the day before he died.

1752
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:03,431
When you are ...

1753
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:09,988
Try to put yourself in the driver's head and the driver's position.

1754
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:14,470
When you do that, why, would Ayrton think about myself

1755
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:17,393
at that this time of the day?

1756
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:22,475
I always thought about that, and it is unbelievable to me.

1757
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:25,836
This message is very strong.

1758
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:30,435
And it has been something really important to me.

1759
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:41,872
Ayrton was still uncomfortable in the new relationship.

But he struggled and put it on pole position.

02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,671
Damn.

02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,751

Ayrton got very very upset and cried.

1784
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:15,948
And that's when I said to him:

1785
02:11:16,039 --> 02:11:19,077
"You know, Ayrton, you've been three-time world champion

1786
02:11:19,159 --> 02:11:22,037
"You're the fastest man in the world."

1787

"Why don't you quit?

"And I'll quit and we'll just go fishing."

That Saturday, at dinner,
Frank Williams was not at all sure

1792
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,278
that Senna would be present on the grid.

1793
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:21,993
I was sure that he did not want to compete.

1794
02:12:32,439 --> 02:12:35,078
The last time I saw Ayrton
was that Sunday.

1795
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:37,190
He was very agitated.

1796
02:12:37,279 --> 02:12:40,158
Some friends went to talk to him.

1797
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:43,914
He was very agitated, was going from
the Williams motor home to the pits.

1798
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:50,958
Back and forth. Before I take my
position in the commentary box,

1799
02:12:51,039 --> 02:12:55,238
I always ask questions about strategy to

and others who are near.

1801

Some respond, others do not

1802
02:13:01,079 --> 02:13:05,118
but they reveal some information

1803
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:07,838
I can report to the public
during the race.

1804
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:13,198
I expected to be able to ask Ayrton
some questions, but could not.

1805
02:13:13,279 --> 02:13:16,476

someone before the race

02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,753
that he would carry an Austrian flag in his overalls.

1825
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:21,997
In victory, or if he was
on the podium, which was very likely,

1826
02:16:22,119 --> 02:16:26,909
he wanted to show the flag
as a tribute to Roland Ratzenberger.

Lights out on the safety car.

1828
02:16:33,159 --> 02:16:36,515

1839
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:09,469
and I saw, from his neurological signs,

1840
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:12,592
that it was going to be a fatal head injury.

1841
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:26,913
Then he sighed,
and his body relaxed.

1842
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:32,237
And that was the moment,
I am not religious,

1843
02:19:32,319 --> 02:19:36,518
that I thought that his spirit had departed.

1844

Seeing the helicopter going to the hospital,

1845
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:35,317
I was still hoping.

1846
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:37,918
I did not realize.

1847
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:44,273
During the live commentary
I did not realize.

1848
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:45,838
Okay, he was going to be injured,

1849
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,512
he was going to be in bad shape

1850
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,193
but I did not realize he was dead.

1851
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:54,754
I did not want to realize, probably.

1852
02:20:56,639 --> 02:20:58,630
It was unreal.

1853
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,308
Ayrton's accident was caused

1854
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:06,755
by problems with his own car.

1855
02:21:07,399 --> 02:21:09,709
And, certainly were,

1856
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:15,878
no way connected to the competitiveness

1857
02:21:15,959 --> 02:21:18,349
of any of the cars around him.

1858
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:24,317
Again, there are people who claim

1859
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:32,358
that his pursuit Michael and the Benetton was

1860
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:40,031
overly aggressively, because of his necessity to compensate

1861
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,429
for the inadequacies of his car.

1862
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:46,191
But again, for me that is nonsense.

1863
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:50,352
Again, it's just people
trying to rewrite the script.

1864
02:21:51,559 --> 02:21:53,595
Simple fact is,

1865
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:58,834
Ayrton, almost certainly suffered a car failure,

1866
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:01,995
which caused the accident,

1867
02:22:05,319 --> 02:22:09,870
and it was one of those things.
These things happen.

1868
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:13,398
For sure it was mechanical problem.

1869
02:22:16,079 --> 02:22:17,832
I'm very careful about what I say,

1870
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:23,915
because they made
the steering column different.

1871
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:28,987
It could be a possibility.

1872
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:32,510
I have really no idea, precisely.

1873
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:37,840
But sure it was mechanical failure.

1874
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:42,954
The gift that he has had to be used.

1875
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:48,909
He had an obligation to whatever force or power gave him that gift.

1876
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:53,548
ge had an obligation to pursue
career, pursue passion.

1877
02:22:55,239 --> 02:22:59,950
And of course that... those thoughts...

1878
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:09,353
They were very much with me,

1879
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:12,430
when he lost his life,

1880
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:23,549
because even in the...even in the moments of realization,

1881
02:23:23,639 --> 02:23:27,552
because at that time no one really knew,
even in the moment of realization

1882
02:23:27,639 --> 02:23:29,755
that he'd lost his life

1883
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:33,316
I found myself...

1884
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:38,316
strangely uncomfortable with the fact

1885
02:23:41,159 --> 02:23:44,834
that wouldn't have done anything
different.

1886
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:52,157
It was what he wanted to do.

1887
02:23:57,159 --> 02:24:00,994
And if that was the outcome...

1888
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,911
linked to his career,

1889
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:15,431
I do not think he would change it,
even if he had the knowledge.

1890
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:19,388
We find out that it was serious
just at the end of the race.

1891
02:24:19,479 --> 02:24:23,029
But even...you always have some different messages.

1892
02:24:23,159 --> 02:24:28,314
I remember that we had some people coming into the commentary saying:

1893
02:24:28,399 --> 02:24:32,950
"Oh, he had a broken arm" and that's it.

1894
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:37,956
Five minutes later
we had very bad news.

1895
02:24:38,559 --> 02:24:42,791
I even said, I remember:
"There's no point to say"

1896
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:47,316
"Unless we know exactly what he had"

1897
02:24:47,399 --> 02:24:50,550
And we did not know during the commentary.

1898
02:24:50,639 --> 02:24:53,836
Then we had big rumours as always.

1899
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:57,389
And during the trip going from track to the airport,

1900
02:24:57,479 --> 02:25:01,916
then we understood that it was really, really bad.

1901
02:25:02,719 --> 02:25:05,280
Did you go to see Frank after the race?

1902
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:08,591
No. Yes, sorry.

1903
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:13,674
I saw...I went to see Frank, in the garage,
just after the race.

1904
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:16,832
After the commentary, that was the first thing I've done.

1905
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:22,074
Frank and Patrick they were together,
but they did not know at the time.

1906
02:25:22,159 --> 02:25:26,073
That was just after the race, they did not know exactly what...

1907
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:27,998
They were really shocked,

1908
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:33,200
but again, they did not want to make any speculation and waiting for that.

1909
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:37,318
We only knew from the track to the airport, more and more that it was

1910
02:25:37,399 --> 02:25:40,790
quite serious.

1911
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:45,956
You reflect on the difficult things in your life and the extreme emotions

1912
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:53,274
and inevitably things don't get better and
in that regard,

1913
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:56,192
with the process of thought,

1914
02:25:56,280 --> 02:26:00,272
the pain only increases, and you know for me, the...

1915
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:10,799
My emotions then were a small fraction of the emotions, that I had when..

1916
02:26:11,719 --> 02:26:14,631
I went to Brazil for his funeral.

1917
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:18,835
All those people in Brazil,

1918
02:26:19,959 --> 02:26:22,632
for all his fans around the world,

1919
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:26,635
He will always be young.

1920
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:38,477
Ayrton Senna will always be fast.

1921
02:26:39,239 --> 02:26:40,958
He will never be old.

1922
02:26:41,719 --> 02:26:43,596
He will always be

1923
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,352
the champion.

1924
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:50,953
of Brazil and of the world.

1925
02:26:56,879 --> 02:27:00,270
The grief, even today,

1926
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:05,388
may be the greatest statement I can make about what he did.

1927
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:09,148
When I meet a Brazilian

1928
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:13,192
Soon after that I have to say,

1929
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:19,989
I knew Ayrton Senna
and I interviewed him over a 100 times.

1930
02:27:21,879 --> 02:27:24,712
I was on a cruise in the Nile River

1931
02:27:24,799 --> 02:27:29,031
and there were 33 Brazilians on this cruise with my wife and I,

1932
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:34,594
and I told one of them that I had
interviewed Ayrton Senna a 100 times.

1933
02:27:34,719 --> 02:27:36,755
Some time during the next week,

1934
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:40,799
every one of those Brazilians had to come to me

1935
02:27:40,879 --> 02:27:45,077
They had to talk to someone
who had talked to Ayrton Senna.

1936
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:48,476
They even had to touch
someone who had touched...

1937
02:27:48,559 --> 02:27:51,028
who had shaken hands with Ayrton Senna.

1938
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:54,907
It was like I had known, and talked to

1939
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,117
and touched and shaken hands with God

1940
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:02,111
And they had to do the same, through me,

1941
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:04,430
These were people who were 8 and 10 years old

1942
02:28:04,559 --> 02:28:06,949
when Ayrton won his championships.

1943
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:09,590
And as children they were taught

1944
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:13,388
that this was one of the greatest men that lived,

1945
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:16,113
who had a Brazilian passport.

1946
02:28:17,239 --> 02:28:20,754
When you dedicate fifteen years to a sport,

1947
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:27,078
you're wondering... Did you spend those years wisely.

1948
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:33,710
And I think I did,
And I know Ayrton Senna ...

1949
02:28:44,239 --> 02:28:48,279
And I know that Ayrton Senna
know that he had.

1950
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:54,309
Can you imagine? I mean in, I would have loved to see

1951
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:59,798
Ayrton with children and grandchildren out on that beach.

1952
02:29:02,559 --> 02:29:05,950
But can you imagine hearing that a news report:

1953
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:10,550
"Ayrton Senna dies of cancer
after a long battle at the age of 50"?

1954
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:14,474
I do not know. In some poetic...

1955
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:19,432
unjust way, it was almost fitting

1956
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:22,670
that he died in a race car.

1957
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:41,828
Even at racing speed
Tamburello is not a corner

1958
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:43,352
you make a mistake on.

1959
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:46,595
Something on the car would have to go wrong.

1960
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:52,470
Maybe the power steering failed.

1961
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,433
Maybe it was the tyre temperatures that

1962
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:58,158
made the car skate off the road.

1963
02:29:58,719 --> 02:30:00,233
It will always remain a mystery.

1964
02:30:02,079 --> 02:30:03,558
There was a lawsuit?

1965
02:30:05,079 --> 02:30:09,755
In my opinion,
the steering column broke

1966
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,877
and the car became uncontrollable.

1967
02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:16,154
But above all, it was inevitable

1968
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:22,270
because the car crashed
at such an angle. The suspension arm

1969
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:24,031
went into his helmet.

1970
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:28,158
Ayrton ran out of luck.

1971
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:34,988
He did not have a broken bone in his body.
He did not have any bruising.

1972
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:39,110
If that piece of assembly

1973
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:42,636
would have gone  6 inches higher, or 6 inches lower,

1974
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:44,317
he would have walked back to the paddock.

1975
02:31:03,399 --> 02:31:05,789
BOLOGNA, ITALY

1976
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,431
I was lucky to arrive

1977
02:31:17,159 --> 02:31:20,994
at airport half an hour before his plane arrived.

1978
02:31:21,079 --> 02:31:26,711
And I saw the coffin put on to a fire engine,

1979
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:32,833
and taken on the road into the city, from the airport.

1980
02:31:33,879 --> 02:31:38,031
on a six-or eight-lane highway

1981
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:40,838
where all the traffic
was going in one direction

1982
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:43,149
following the fire engine.

1983
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:45,588
Vehicles of every kind you can possibly imagine.

1984
02:31:45,719 --> 02:31:48,075
It was just extraordinary.

1985
02:31:48,959 --> 02:31:52,475
We all followed him,
many with flags, banners

1986
02:31:52,559 --> 02:31:57,587
portraits of him taped to the side of cars, and lorries

1987
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:01,149
every kind of vehicle that you can imagine.

1988
02:32:01,959 --> 02:32:05,747
on this high speed run
into the city,

1989
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:12,757
past houses and windows filled with people,

1990
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:15,912
apartment blocks, flags, banners,

1991
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,673
over bridges crowded with people,

1992
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:24,076
all come out to salute him.

1993
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:29,673
And then people queuing
when the body was lying in state,

1994
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:32,832
people queuing for seven or eight hours.

1995
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:36,037
Children, old people, every kind of person,

1996
02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:40,152
with a predominance of young people

1997
02:32:40,239 --> 02:32:43,595
because Brazil, was a young country, demographically

1998
02:32:44,479 --> 02:32:50,793
And young people seemed to have
a special relationship with him.

1999
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:54,191
But old people as well... All kinds of people.

2000
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:58,956
Queuing for hours, hours and hours just to go past the body

2001
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:02,396
and leave a little keepsakes by the coffin.

2002
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:04,191
An amazing sight.

2003
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:08,272
And then another motorcade up to the cemetery for the funeral.

2004
02:33:08,399 --> 02:33:12,359
Again with people hanging off every wall and tree and

2005
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:15,317
every conceivable surface.

2006
02:33:17,159 --> 02:33:23,075
The sky filled with helicopters, news helicopters
those kinds of things

2007
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:27,912
And then the jets, from the Brazilian Air Force

2008
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,990
their equivalent to the Red Arrows,

2009
02:33:30,079 --> 02:33:33,709
Drawing a kind of Senna "S" in the sky with smoke

2010
02:33:34,479 --> 02:33:36,277
Amazing.

2011
02:33:38,159 --> 02:33:40,719
I went to the funeral of Bob Marley,

2012
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:47,914
which was very very similar
like an entire nation coming out

2013
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:53,798
to acknowledge someone who

2014
02:33:53,879 --> 02:33:57,918
represented them to the world.

2015
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:05,273
SAO PAULO
4th MAY 1994

2016
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:15,078
He was my idol.
He represented the best of Brazil.

2017
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,554
I miss you, Senna.

2018
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:21,478
I will never forget you.

2019
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:28,308
Brazilians need food,
education, health

2020
02:34:28,399 --> 02:34:29,593
and a little joy.

2021
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:30,748
The joy has been removed.

2022
02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:49,958
AYRTON SENNA DA SILVA
21/03/1960 - 01/05/1994

2023
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:53,590
Nothing can separate me from the love of God.

2024
02:36:55,719 --> 02:36:57,630
Who is or has been

2025
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:01,638
the greatest driver that you have ever raced against

2026
02:37:01,719 --> 02:37:03,278
Past or present.

2027
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:10,557
I would have to go back

2028
02:37:14,399 --> 02:37:16,469
to '78 and '79

2029
02:37:18,639 --> 02:37:21,756
and 1980, when I was go-kart driving.

2030
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:29,629
I came to Europe, for the first time to compete outside Brazil.

2031
02:37:29,719 --> 02:37:34,316
as a teammate of Fullerton,

2032
02:37:34,479 --> 02:37:38,155
Name Fullerton.
He was very experienced.

2033
02:37:38,239 --> 02:37:40,708
I enjoyed very much driving with him

2034
02:37:40,799 --> 02:37:43,871
because he was fast, he was consistent.

2035
02:37:43,959 --> 02:37:45,995
He was for me a very complete driver.

2036
02:37:47,399 --> 02:37:49,868
And it was pure driving, pure racing.

2037
02:37:52,879 --> 02:37:55,916
There wasn't any politics then, right?

2038
02:37:56,239 --> 02:37:57,718
And no money involved either.

2039
02:37:57,799 --> 02:37:59,518
So it was real racing

2040
02:38:01,719 --> 02:38:06,350
And I have that as a very good memory.

2041
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:30,270
Ayrton Senna died at the age of 34.

2042
02:38:31,799 --> 02:38:33,870
As a result of his death,

2043
02:38:33,959 --> 02:38:36,190
the FIA appointed
Professor Sid Watkins

2044
02:38:36,280 --> 02:38:38,475
to improve safety in Formula One.

2045
02:38:38,559 --> 02:38:43,111
No fatalities have occurred in
Formula One since.

2046
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:46,995
The Ayrton Senna Foundation,
founded in 1995 by his sister Viviane,

2047
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:49,634
has helped to educate more than 1.2
million needy children in Brazil.

2048
02:38:52,479 --> 02:38:54,834
Alain Prost is a member of the
advisory board of the foundation.
