1
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,578
Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie! Charlie!

2
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:40,950
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

3
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,732
Thank you! Thank you very much!

4
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:13,333
Thank you!

5
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:17,466
How you all doing tonight?

6
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,837
It's great to see all of you here.

7
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:34,971
My name is Charlie Bartlett!

8
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:41,848
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

9
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,188
<i>Charlie. Charlie!</i>

10
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:45,499
Charlie!

11
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,726
Your mom's here.

12
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:51,862
She's in the dean's office.

13
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,027
Good luck, Charlie. Stay out of trouble.

14
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:59,485
<i>I'm not sure I understand.
Is it his grades?</i>

15
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,803
No, Mrs. Bartlett, it's not his grades
and it's not his attendance.

16
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:08,084
Look, quite frankly, he is one of
our brightest boys here at school,

17
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:09,975
albeit, unusual.

18
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,343
Well, I'm just not sure
why he must be expelled, then.

19
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:16,285
Well, this might shed some light.

20
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:22,394
You're expelling him
for making a driver's license?

21
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,741
He's been running a laminating press
from inside his dorm room,

22
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,565
and he has been selling them
to the other students.

23
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,933
You have to admit,
they look pretty authentic.

24
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:36,505
Look, Mrs. Bartlett, to be honest,
I think he has a lot of potential.

25
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:40,885
He's innovative, he's intelligent.
He's obviously highly motivated.

26
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,806
Perhaps this would be
a good time for an endowment.

27
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:47,318
No. Mrs. Bartlett, what he did was illegal

28
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,464
and we can't overlook that.

29
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,215
- Okay.
- Okay.

30
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,067
- I understand.
- Good.

31
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,061
Are you mad?

32
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,392
You know, I'm not.

33
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,002
I just can't fathom why you did it.
It's not like you needed the money.

34
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:15,097
I mean, really, Charlie, what would
your father say if he were here?

35
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,985
Mom, they were just starting
to appreciate me.

36
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,705
You know, I was the guy
that everyone wanted to meet.

37
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:27,451
Well, maybe there's more
to high school than being well liked.

38
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,389
Like what, specifically?

39
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:33,822
Nothing comes to mind.

40
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,740
I guess now we try you living at home
and going to public school.

41
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,941
I even kept your room
exactly the way you left it.

42
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,593
Hey, Mom, have you been feeding my fish?

43
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,289
Oh, dear.

44
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:57,694
Mom? I think I might take
the bus in tomorrow.

45
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,541
Really? I was going to have
Thomas drive you.

46
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:04,862
I know, but I don't think anybody else
is going to show up with a chauffeur.

47
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:07,644
You're probably right.

48
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,999
- Have you taken your Klonopin today?
- I haven't.

49
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,583
- Where do you suppose I put that?
- Probably in your purse.

50
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,628
There you are.
What would I do without you, Charlie?

51
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:29,171
<i>And we knew who we were then</i>

52
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:33,371
<i>Girls were girls and men were men</i>

53
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:40,084
<i>Mister, we could use a man
like Herbert Hoover again</i>

54
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:45,371
<i>Those were the days</i>

55
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,886
Well, it's wonderful
to have you back, Charlie.

56
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,662
Thanks, Mom. I missed you, too.

57
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,703
Are you kidding me? Suzy Q!

58
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,028
What? Come in.

59
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,626
Hi. Volume. Thank you.

60
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:27,516
Hold on, The Principal is here.
What do you want, Dad?

61
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,786
Why do you call me The Principal
when you're talking to your friends?

62
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:32,124
Pretending to have contempt for you
gives me a certain amount of cred,

63
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,336
if you can understand that.

64
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:34,683
No, no, no.

65
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,409
Okay, what do you want?

66
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,715
- I wanna say hi.
- Hi.

67
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,401
Fresh crack rock.

68
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,772
- God, it's called rock candy.
- That was a joke.

69
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:46,588
I was eating it decades before
you were even conceived.

70
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:47,865
I'll be in my office.

71
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,244
- Love you.
- Love you. Bye.

72
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:55,221
<i>You have two new messages. </i>

73
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,492
<i>Nathan, I think it might be
a good idea if I'm there</i>

74
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,341
<i>when you break the news
about installing cameras to the kids</i>

75
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:04,756
<i>so the announcement is taken,
you know, seriously. </i>

76
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,867
<i>Next message.
- Nathan, it's me. </i>

77
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,804
<i>I'm wondering why Susan
hasn't been returning my calls. </i>

78
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,089
<i>Is it of no consequence to you</i>

79
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,330
<i>whether she has a relationship
with her mother, you fuck... </i>

80
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,329
I think you got the wrong bus.

81
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:44,122
Western Summit High School, right?

82
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,238
Okay.

83
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:02,644
Hi, I'm Charlie.

84
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,628
Hi, Charlie. I'm Len.

85
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,992
Good to meet you, Len.

86
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,266
It's good to meet you, Charlie.

87
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,539
Thank you.

88
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,648
<i>There's just no point
in cause unnecessary trouble</i>

89
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,717
Nice tie, homie.

90
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:34,682
Killer roach, bro.

91
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,889
Move out of the way! Get out!

92
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:56,025
<i>There's just no point
in cause unnecessary trouble</i>

93
00:07:56,095 --> 00:08:00,153
<i>Just make sure you cause trouble
when it's necessary</i>

94
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,841
<i>There's just no point
in cause unnecessary trouble</i>

95
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:05,332
They didn't give you a locker
in the teachers' lounge?

96
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:07,293
Oh, I'm not a teacher.

97
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:09,947
You sure look like a teacher.

98
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:13,397
Okay, everyone, last chance to sign up.
The auditions are today

99
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:16,471
and will be held at 4:00
and everybody's welcome.

100
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,357
<i>Yeah. And for everyone who doesn't know,
this year we're doing Henry V. </i>

101
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:23,165
And it's Shakespeare, so feel free
to read for a role of the opposite sex.

102
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,631
See you at 4:00, professor.

103
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,125
Dense fucking nug, man.

104
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,365
Shit, why are you looking at it like that?
You're gonna buy it.

105
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,398
You've done every other time.
Just fucking buy it.

106
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,119
Hi, I'm Charlie.

107
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,844
What's that? Is that a briefcase?

108
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:50,171
Actually, I believe it's an attaché case.

109
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,574
What's that thing on your jacket mean?

110
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,849
Oh, this?

111
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:57,564
<i>Cor ad cor loquitur. It's in Latin. </i>

112
00:08:58,526 --> 00:08:59,770
I think the translation is,

113
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,588
"Heart speaks to heart, "
but I may be wrong.

114
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:05,918
Is he, like, a total faggot or what? Shut up.

115
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:10,295
Is that a rhetorical question?

116
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:15,414
Guess not.

117
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,012
Fuck him up!

118
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,157
Fuck, yeah!

119
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,674
Guess what?
I think you like that, you little bitch.

120
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:26,044
How do you like that, you little bitch?

121
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,271
No smokes! Cigarettes out!

122
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:36,120
What have we here?

123
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,965
Nothing. We're just messing around.

124
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,177
Mr. Bivens, Mr...

125
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,668
You, get to class. Now. Let's go.

126
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,077
Later, homo.

127
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:56,948
You okay?

128
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,069
Yeah.

129
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,958
I'm so sick of my parents.
Like, honestly, I'm 17.

130
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:07,576
I don't see what the big deal is.
I mean, it's just a hole.

131
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:09,883
I mean, what does my mom care
how many times I get my ears pierced?

132
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:11,096
The squad doesn't care.

133
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,337
Whitney, I think you should get
your na-na pierced.

134
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,316
That's gross, you 'tard.

135
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,775
Hi, I'm Charlie.

136
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:26,424
Come on.

137
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:42,493
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Len.

138
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,894
Len, you want to join me?

139
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,624
Thank you, Charlie.

140
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,894
I got peas and carrots.

141
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:58,268
I love peas and carrots.
- Me, too.

142
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:05,405
When, Caius, Rome is thine,
thou art poorest of all,

143
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,956
then shortly art thou mine.

144
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:11,899
And scene.

145
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,354
Thank you. That was stunning.

146
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:19,063
Charlie Bartlett.

147
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:26,262
So, which one of Shakespeare's works
will you be performing for us?

148
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,263
Actually, I thought I'd do a monologue
from Cordiroy Seville's masterpiece,

149
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,756
<i>Misadventures of a Teenage Renegade. </i>

150
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,877
I guess I should tell you

151
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,089
about the first time I had my period.

152
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:47,800
My daddy was driving me back
from summer camp

153
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,627
and I turned to him and I said,

154
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:53,142
"Daddy, I think I'm sloughing. "

155
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,931
And he said, "That's nice, honey. "

156
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:59,800
And I realized that he had,

157
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,692
like, no idea just what "sloughing" meant.

158
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,150
So I explained to him that it meant

159
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:13,111
blood was gushing
from my you-know-where.

160
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:16,278
And he nearly wrecked the car

161
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,100
trying to hand me
a wad of fast-food napkins,

162
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,660
which is not something that you

163
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:23,701
particularly want to stick up your hooch.

164
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:30,039
Great. Thank you.

165
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,153
I wasn't quite finished, actually.

166
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:34,132
No. That'll do. Thank you, Charlie.

167
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,059
I'm gonna fuck you up.

168
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:45,752
- You getting this?
- Yeah. I'm getting it.

169
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:49,980
- Yeah! Fuck him up, Murph!
- How does that feel?

170
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,534
I don't care. You know why?
Because that was a rhetorical question.

171
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:57,043
Hey, Charlie, what's Latin for,
"I'm a total pussy"?

172
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:58,940
Let's get out of here.

173
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:05,822
Charlie, how'd it go?
- Stellar.

174
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,211
Did you make any friends?

175
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:15,197
Okay, you can forget about
school tomorrow.

176
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,270
I'm calling Dr. Weathers.

177
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:22,644
Now, your mom tells me that you've been
getting into scrapes with the other boys.

178
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,634
That's the best euphemism

179
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:27,484
for getting the living crap
kicked out of you that I've ever heard.

180
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,682
And why do you suppose
that you're being picked on?

181
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,266
I don't know. I'm abnormal, I guess.

182
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,122
You don't feel normal?

183
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:40,731
My family has a psychiatrist on call.
How normal can that be?

184
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:43,866
How are your classes?

185
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:45,529
They're all right.

186
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,282
I mean, I have trouble
concentrating sometimes.

187
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,587
And what is it that you think about?

188
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,949
I kind of have this one fantasy.

189
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:55,421
Sexual?

190
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:56,948
No, not really.

191
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:01,811
It's just this fantasy of me
stepping out on stage,

192
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:04,090
and there are all these kids
out in the audience

193
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:07,987
chanting my name,
like I'm a rock star, you know.

194
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:11,030
And so, I step up to the mike and I say,

195
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:13,395
"How you all doing tonight?"

196
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,543
And then they start cheering and cheering.

197
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:18,199
"It's great to see all of you.
I'm Charlie Bartlett.

198
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,085
"And if there's one thing
I want you to walk away with tonight,

199
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,965
"it's that the sky is the limit.

200
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,129
"So, for those of you with troubles,
for those of you feeling scared,

201
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,205
"or confused or angry,

202
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,693
"remember, you are not alone. "

203
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,621
And then they go nuts again.

204
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:46,941
Charlie, how are you feeling
about your father these days?

205
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:49,111
Are you angry that he's gone?

206
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,059
- Gas prices.
- Excuse me?

207
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,845
I also worry a lot in class
about rising gas prices.

208
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:06,043
Charlie, I'm going to write you
a prescription for Ritalin,

209
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,045
and what I'd like you to do
is start taking the low dose

210
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,606
and if after a few days
you feel no side effects,

211
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:15,224
then I would like to see
you start taking a higher dose.

212
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,149
So you think I have ADD, or...

213
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:21,305
We won't know that until the Ritalin
helps this concentration problem.

214
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:25,843
You mean, if I take the medicine
and it helps me concentrate,

215
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,861
we'll know I have ADD?

216
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:29,363
That's the idea.

217
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,333
Welcome back, professor.

218
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:43,129
- Fuck you.
- Yeah. Fuck you.

219
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:49,364
Can anyone tell me why Mercury
has only one day per year?

220
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:53,178
Because Mercury is the only planet
that does not rotate on its axis.

221
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,226
<i>Hello. Good morning. </i>

222
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:34,614
<i>The word of the day is "gratitude. "</i>

223
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,241
<i>"Gratitude: The quality of being thankful, </i>

224
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,277
<i>"readiness to show appreciation for
and return kindness. "</i>

225
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,765
<i>As in, if you would all sit down
and shut up, </i>

226
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,319
<i>I am prepared to express my gratitude.
Thank you. </i>

227
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:49,047
<i>A lot on the agenda today. </i>

228
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,020
<i>Our superintendent, Mr. Sedgwick,
is paying us a visit, </i>

229
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,647
<i>so for my sake,
let's be on our best behavior. </i>

230
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:59,258
<i>First off, the student lounge will be
closed Monday, </i>

231
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,213
<i>while we install security cameras. </i>

232
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:06,648
<i>Yes. </i>

233
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:08,627
How can you do that?
That's, like, invasion of privacy.

234
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,348
<i>There's a liability issue, </i>

235
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,942
<i>and I'm afraid the board
has already passed the motion. </i>

236
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:17,048
<i>Anyway, I would now like
to give Mr. Sedgwick the floor</i>

237
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,612
<i>to discuss our cell phone policy. </i>

238
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:23,323
But the student lounge is the only place
we can hang out without teachers.

239
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,205
Are there cameras in the teachers' lounge?

240
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:29,620
<i>Hang out?</i>

241
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:33,436
<i>Okay, we've already moved on
to the cell phone policy. </i>

242
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,957
<i>There will be ample opportunity
to discuss that later, but right now... </i>

243
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,753
This is total and absolute bullshit!

244
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:38,836
Come on.

245
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:41,524
<i>Right. Right. </i>

246
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,931
<i>You know, you kids really need to
find appropriate ways</i>

247
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:46,551
<i>to express your ingratitude. </i>

248
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,029
<i>Mr. Sedgwick?</i>

249
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:51,572
<i>The... </i>

250
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,723
<i>Come on, guys, it's nothing.
It's just a fire drill. </i>

251
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:59,668
<i>Proceed outside in an orderly fashion. </i>

252
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:02,077
<i>Let's not have a stampede. </i>

253
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:04,051
They don't have much
respect for you, do they?

254
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:07,421
In case you haven't noticed,
they're not too fond of you, either.

255
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,941
I said respect, Nathan, not affection.

256
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:12,883
We're not trying to win
a popularity contest.

257
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:14,422
I'm really looking forward to us
having the weekend alone.

258
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,779
I thought maybe we could go
to a wine tasting.

259
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:21,435
We haven't done that since you were a kid.

260
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,472
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

261
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:29,756
- You haven't touched your food.
- I'm not hungry, Mom.

262
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:32,856
I'm studying the osmosis of water
through the epidermis.

263
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:36,820
Now, I cooked a perfectly edible meal,
Charlie Bartlett.

264
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:41,142
I'm feeling a little under-appreciated
at the moment.

265
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:45,436
And I think it's very important
that you try to at least eat your greens.

266
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,824
Dear, didn't Dr. Weathers
say something yesterday about fluid?

267
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:50,355
What did he say about...

268
00:19:57,854 --> 00:19:59,348
Are you listening to me?

269
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,931
Hello!

270
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:08,504
Can anybody up there hear me?

271
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,684
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

272
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,707
Charlie, is that you?

273
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:23,705
Wake up, you sleepyheads, wake up!

274
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:32,215
Wake up! Wake up!
My name is Charlie Bartlett,

275
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:34,358
and I am not alone!

276
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:39,801
Now, there's no history of drug use
whatsoever, Mrs...

277
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:44,090
It's Marilyn.
Please, no need to be formal here.

278
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:46,875
And drug use? No, none at all.

279
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:51,035
Well, it looks like he's coming down some.

280
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:55,668
I'm not an MD, but it is possible
for Ritalin to get you pretty high.

281
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:58,044
That's probably what it is.
It is a new medication.

282
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,583
<i>It is a new medication
New medication</i>

283
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,621
<i>New medication</i>

284
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:10,035
Charlie, dear.

285
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:16,661
Yeah, as I was saying, a lot of the kids
at the colleges are taking this stuff.

286
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:20,312
When I was in college,
we were dropping tabs of acid.

287
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:23,190
I've never partaken in
any illicit drugs myself.

288
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:27,770
Maybe...

289
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:30,300
Maybe you got slapped around
too many times

290
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:32,732
for lunch money on your way to the bus.

291
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:35,219
Maybe your pop's got a boozing... No.

292
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:37,911
Maybe your pop...

293
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:41,652
Maybe your pop's gotta
booze himself up every morning.

294
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:44,857
Maybe your father has to, how do you say,

295
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:47,220
plow roads with a sense of humor.

296
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:49,082
I mean, he has to booze himself up.

297
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,841
With a sense of humor.

298
00:22:58,238 --> 00:23:00,310
- Morning.
- Good morning.

299
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:01,559
Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

300
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,605
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, guys.

301
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:05,717
- Hey, Len.
- Hey, Charlie.

302
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:11,252
Len, do you feel like making 50 bucks
after school today?

303
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,602
Fifty bucks.

304
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:27,606
Hey!

305
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,108
What the hell is this?

306
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:33,622
- Charlie wants to talk to you.
- Suck this, mongoloid.

307
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:36,179
Get the hell off me! Fuck!

308
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,240
Hi, Murphy. How are you?

309
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:42,803
You must have a fucking death wish!

310
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:45,398
Charlie says you gotta be nice.

311
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,048
Look, Murph, I think we got started off
on the wrong foot.

312
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,539
- I want to work things out.
- I'm gonna put you in the fucking hospital.

313
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,848
- Len.
- Fuck.

314
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:55,894
Len.

315
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:04,986
Listen, Murph, I've had a lot of time
to think about what you did to me.

316
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:07,704
Yeah? What did you come up with, genius?

317
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:09,432
I think you're angry, man.

318
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,989
What have I got to be angry about?

319
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,117
Maybe you got slapped around
one too many times

320
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:19,570
for lunch money on your way to the bus.

321
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:21,850
Maybe your pop's gotta
booze himself up every morning

322
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,154
so he can plow roads
with a sense of humor.

323
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:26,261
Then when he gets home, you're just

324
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,333
a distant third to Sloppy Joes
and a bad sitcom.

325
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:33,298
Maybe the cheerleaders call you
a scumbag behind your back.

326
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:36,246
Maybe it's because the school's
got you placed on the remedial track

327
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:40,311
and your teachers are really good
at making you feel like an idiot.

328
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,876
Maybe it's none of these things.

329
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:50,140
Maybe it's all of them.

330
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:58,680
- What do you want from me?
- I wanna be your friend, Murphy.

331
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:04,024
Okay, maybe you're not a total tool,

332
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:07,803
but guys like you and guys like me
can't be friends.

333
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,939
- Why's that?
- I take the train tracks home.

334
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:14,900
- You drive around in a limo.
- I guess you're right.

335
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,383
Look, I got 90 pills of Ritalin
that we could sell at the dance.

336
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:23,098
Maybe we're just gonna have to
settle for being business partners.

337
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,180
What do these do?

338
00:25:24,254 --> 00:25:27,320
Floods the brain
with norepinephrine and dopamine.

339
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,943
It gets you high.

340
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,307
So, I figure $10 a pill, right?

341
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:33,396
We split the profit,

342
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,299
which means you make almost 500 bucks
without spending a nickel.

343
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:44,828
Business partners, huh?

344
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,844
So, 1:00, right?

345
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,827
What? What happens at 1:00?

346
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:54,749
- My curfew, at 1:00.
- Where are you going?

347
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:58,490
The dance, Dad. I'm going to the dance.
I told you last week.

348
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:01,436
- Have you given up your singing?
- No. Why?

349
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:04,087
I don't know, just...
You've got a great voice.

350
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:05,881
I used to love coming home
to hear you singing in the other room.

351
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:09,689
That's how I knew
you were happy, I guess.

352
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:14,229
Happily texting,
ignoring this intimate exchange.

353
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:16,472
Who's that? Who are you texting?

354
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,200
Rodine's outside.

355
00:26:19,902 --> 00:26:21,047
Have fun.

356
00:26:21,118 --> 00:26:24,467
- I will. So, 2:00, right?
- Nice try.

357
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:27,891
God, I liked you better
when you were a history teacher.

358
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:29,689
That makes two of us.

359
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,835
- I'll see you guys in a minute.
- Okay.

360
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,627
- Hey, Susan.
- Hey.

361
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:42,228
So, you think there's any chance
of a dance tonight, or...

362
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,317
I'd say there's a distinct possibility,
Charlie Bartlett.

363
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,140
Hey.

364
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:57,365
- So, how did we do?
- Well, it's gone.

365
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,535
- Gone?
- All of it. Every last pill.

366
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:02,650
It's gone.

367
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,540
- Well, shit.
- Yeah.

368
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:10,842
Superman!

369
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,430
Eighty-eight miles per hour!

370
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:23,419
Fucking A!

371
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:46,167
Hey, Charlie. What's up, man?

372
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:51,064
<i>God damn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh</i>

373
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:55,224
<i>God damn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh</i>

374
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:56,858
Hey, man.

375
00:27:58,493 --> 00:27:59,770
<i>Uh-huh</i>

376
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:07,222
<i>God damn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh</i>

377
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:36,212
- This sucks.
- Seriously sucks.

378
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,098
Thank you.

379
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,332
Charlie, you want to sign this petition?

380
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,063
It's to get the security cameras
out of our student lounge.

381
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,562
Oh, absolutely.

382
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:59,381
- It's right here.
- All right.

383
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:00,692
- Thanks.
- No problem.

384
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:02,042
See you later, Charlie.

385
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:04,248
- Hey, girls. You gonna sign this?
- Yeah.

386
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,100
Hi.

387
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:15,608
- You're Charlie Bartlett, right?
- Yeah.

388
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:17,750
I'm Kip. Kip Crombwell.

389
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:20,540
Nice to meet you, Kip.

390
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:23,445
Yeah.

391
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:28,819
Do you think there's any way
that we could maybe talk in private?

392
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,237
Sure.

393
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:37,298
Everyone, come on, this petition
gets those cameras out of our lounge.

394
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,642
So, what's up?

395
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:48,278
Is it true that you can get a hold
of medication?

396
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,451
Yeah, I guess. Why? What's going on?

397
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:57,179
I'm, like, totally depressed.

398
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:00,628
I've been having these spells,
and trouble breathing,

399
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,228
mostly in class.

400
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:05,819
What does it feel like?

401
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,311
It feels like a heart attack.

402
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:12,599
But I'm thinking, you know,
it's probably mental.

403
00:30:14,557 --> 00:30:15,572
And I can't go to my parents about it,

404
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:18,231
because they already think I'm a freak,
so I just thought that you...

405
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:20,821
Look, I'm not a doctor, but...

406
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:24,311
I don't know if Ritalin's gonna help you.

407
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,061
Do you know what would?

408
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:28,540
I'm not sure.

409
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,972
But I'm gonna find out.

410
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,850
I'm gonna work this out, I promise.

411
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:38,901
Yeah.

412
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:40,465
Thanks.

413
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:11,573
I get short of breath and dizzy,
you know, nausea, blurred vision.

414
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:14,645
I mean, sometimes it feels like
a heart attack.

415
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:17,019
Yeah, we call that a panic attack.

416
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,743
Oh, is that what they call it?

417
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:20,123
Well, what can we do?

418
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:24,444
Well, I think maybe
I'll put you on a low dose of

419
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:27,193
Xanax and Zoloft.

420
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:33,426
Okay, so, here's the thing.
In everything that I've read,

421
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:37,243
there's not one case of anyone dying
of a panic attack.

422
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:40,571
- No?
- No. Not one.

423
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:44,314
So the next time you start to feel anxious,
you just tell yourself,

424
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:48,440
"Hey, I'm having a panic attack.
I'm not gonna die.

425
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:52,087
"In fact, in 15 minutes,
I'll probably feel fine. "

426
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:56,407
What do I do until then?

427
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,194
Murph, start him on
50 milligrams of Zoloft

428
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,196
and half a milligram of Xanax as needed.

429
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:06,936
Here, Kip, this should provide you
with some relief

430
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:09,307
and we'll just meet next week,
same time, same place, okay?

431
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:13,242
- Thank you, Charlie.
- No problem. Be nice, Murphy.

432
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:30,491
Charlie, I spoke to Dr. Weathers today.

433
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:33,241
He said you may have not only ADD,

434
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:37,179
but a whole battery
of psychological disorders

435
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,798
that will likely plague you for life.

436
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,131
Sounds a bit melodramatic,
don't you think?

437
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:44,724
That's what I said.

438
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,725
Then he went on to imply that
you may have inherited it from me.

439
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,290
I was rather perturbed.

440
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:54,554
I mean, look at me.
I'm as fit as a fucking fiddle.

441
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:57,852
Can't argue with that.

442
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:01,340
Are you making any friends at all?

443
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,274
Working on it.

444
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:09,659
He says he doesn't want to see me.

445
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,699
I can't stop crying.

446
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:16,246
Well, sometimes people say one thing
and they really mean another, like...

447
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:19,448
He called me a loser,
and last night he hit my mom.

448
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:23,667
You have to understand that
what he's doing isn't because of you.

449
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:25,716
He hates his life so much that...

450
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:29,401
All I wanna do is drop acid.
I just can't handle this place.

451
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:32,662
Duh, dude. This place sucks.

452
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:35,257
But I just worry that one day
we're gonna look back at high school

453
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,365
and wish we'd done something different.

454
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:38,452
So maybe you should...

455
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:39,572
Get breast implants.

456
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,499
I mean, a lot of my friends
are getting them.

457
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:43,866
Well, that's up to you,
but speaking as a guy,

458
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:46,453
it's kind of a turnoff when a girl
isn't cool with being herself.

459
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,763
I'm not saying that I'm gay.

460
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,343
So what if, you know,
I'm not attracted to girls?

461
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,869
You know, this sucks, man.

462
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:57,724
Well, at least you're attracted
to somebody.

463
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:00,178
I mean, if you weren't,
then we'd really be up shit's creek.

464
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:03,643
I feel very productive,
and I can't sleep at all.

465
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,386
I lose weight,
and I'm given to frivolous spending

466
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:08,980
and promiscuity.

467
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,573
Wow. What I'd like to do is...

468
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:14,492
Introduce you to some of
the serotonergic antidepressants,

469
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:15,986
like Prozac.

470
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:17,109
What else can you tell me about...

471
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:21,490
Feelings of depersonalization
and boredom.

472
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:23,698
Anger and aggression. Irritability.

473
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:26,773
Obsessive behavior is I guess
what you guys call it.

474
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:30,903
Like, whenever I hear anyone say a word
that starts with the letter...

475
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,810
I have to say five words that start
with the letter "V"

476
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:36,340
and tap my head with my right hand.

477
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:38,227
Perhaps we should start with...

478
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:41,399
Viagra! Virgin! Venal! Vagabond! Vagina!

479
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:53,045
<i>Ain't I clean, bad machine
super cool, super mean</i>

480
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:56,857
<i>Feelin' good for the man
Superfly, here I stand</i>

481
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,616
<i>Secret stash, heavy bread</i>

482
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:00,179
- Thanks.
- No problem.

483
00:35:00,253 --> 00:35:01,333
You're in luck.

484
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:03,128
We're running a special
on Wellbutrin today.

485
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:06,650
<i>I'm your pusherman</i>

486
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:09,814
<i>Heavy mind
Have you signed?</i>

487
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:12,787
Is there something wrong
with the other bathroom?

488
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,809
Yo!

489
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:18,517
<i>Ghetto prince is my thing
Makin' love's how I swing</i>

490
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,051
<i>I'm your pusherman</i>

491
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,737
<i>I'm your pusherman</i>

492
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:25,563
Hi, Charlie!

493
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:28,540
- Hi, Charlie!
- Hi, Charlie!

494
00:35:29,532 --> 00:35:30,580
Hi.

495
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:35,350
I'm so glad to hear
that you're doing better, Charlie.

496
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:37,396
The truth is, we sometimes don't know

497
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,323
how you youngsters
are gonna react to these medications.

498
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:44,148
Trust me, Doc, bringing psychiatric
drugs and teenagers together

499
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:47,188
is like opening a lemonade stand
in the desert.

500
00:35:51,964 --> 00:35:56,220
Can you shut the fuck up for one second?
We're working here. Shit.

501
00:35:56,285 --> 00:35:59,067
- Whatever, man.
- Fuck.

502
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,896
Murph, is that my face making that sound?

503
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:08,088
Yeah. It's kind of sad, dude.
You didn't even put up a fight.

504
00:36:08,157 --> 00:36:10,840
What did you tape this for, anyway?

505
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:13,844
I always have my fights taped.
It's what I do.

506
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:15,346
Really?

507
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:19,698
<i>Yeah, man, they're fun to watch in, like,
a Greatest Rodeo Deaths kind of way. </i>

508
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,911
You don't feel bad
for the kids or anything?

509
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,093
Bad?

510
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:27,703
Kind of.

511
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:31,098
Well, what do you want me to do?

512
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:35,862
- Maybe we should make it up to them?
- Dude, are you serious?

513
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:37,975

- Kip. Hey.

528
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:29,204
I heard that you were giving us
some of the proceeds?

529
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:31,066
You heard right, my friend. Murph?

530
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,343
There you go.
Pleasure doing business with you.

531

<i>Charlie Bartlett
to the principal's office. </i>

537
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:03,287
So, you're the infamous Charlie Bartlett.
We haven't officially met yet.

538
00:38:03,357 --> 00:38:05,145
I'm Nathan Gardner,
your beloved principal,

539
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:07,122
and this is our superintendent,
Mr. Sedgwick,

540
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:09,717
who made a special visit to meet you.

541
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:14,610
Is it safe to assume
you know why you're here?

542
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:17,332
No, not exactly.

543
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:28,051
This might well be the most disturbing
thing I've ever seen at this school.

544
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:31,321
Peddling this kind of trash
makes you reprehensible.

545
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,354
Do you know
what "reprehensible" means?

546
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,486
- Yes, sir.
- Do you understand what you did wrong?

547
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:41,176
No, sir. Not really.

548
00:38:42,813 --> 00:38:43,761
Not really? Okay.

549
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:47,415
Well, you've got three days
of suspension to think about it.

550
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:52,850
Hey, what's up?

551
00:38:52,925 --> 00:38:55,161
Hey, aren't you suspended?

552
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:56,243
- Yeah.
- Nice.

553
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:58,488
Hey, do you wanna hang out?
- Sure.

554
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:01,372
- Cool. Come inside.
- Thank you.

555
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:04,568
Do you want
to spend an evening at Château Bartlett?

556
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:05,651
Yes.

557
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:07,830
Thomas, Château Bartlett,
please.

558
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:12,508
Is this technically
considered a mansion?

559
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:15,572
Well, my mom calls it "The Estate. "

560
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,106
Oh. La-di-da.

561
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:20,889
Oh, can you play this one?

562
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:22,550
Yeah.

563
00:39:30,813 --> 00:39:34,457
<i>Well, if you want to sing out, sing out</i>

564
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:38,235
<i>And if you want to be free, be free</i>

565
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:41,367
<i>'Cause there's a million things to be</i>

566
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:44,437
<i>You know that there are</i>

567
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:49,521
<i>And if you want to live high, live high</i>

568
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:53,819
<i>And if you wanna live low, live low</i>

569
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,513
<i>You can do what you want</i>

570
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:05,913
<i>The opportunity's on</i>

571
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:09,144
<i>And if you find a new way</i>

572
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:12,344
<i>You can do it today</i>

573
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,377
Hi, Mom.

574
00:40:18,396 --> 00:40:21,331
Oh, yeah. Mom, this is Susan.

575
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:24,088
Susan, this is my mother, Marilyn.

576
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:27,570
It's such a pleasure to meet you, Susan.

577
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:29,652
Yeah, you too, Marilyn.

578
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:45,083
- She seems very nice.
- Yeah.

579
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,411
Do I get to meet your dad, too?

580
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,042
No, he's actually not with us anymore.

581
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:55,538
Oh. I'm sorry.

582
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:58,776
Yeah. It's okay.

583
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:02,714
He was a CIA agent, you know. Yeah.

584
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:06,577
He survived Somalia, Yugoslavia, Iraq.

585
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,107
Finally, he came home, you know,

586
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,628
and our favorite thing to do together
was to get ice cream.

587
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:15,895
So, one day, I was just sitting around

588
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:18,583
and I heard the ice cream truck outside

589
00:41:18,653 --> 00:41:21,271
and it always played the same song,

590
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:23,032
<i>Yankee Doodle. </i>

591
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,996
So, basically, he ran out
to stop the truck and it just

592
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,938
drove right over him
and killed him instantly.

593
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:32,758
Are you fucking with me?

594
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:35,226
<i>Yankee Doodle went to town</i>

595
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,918
<i>riding on a pony</i>

596
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:40,633
<i>Stuck a feather in his hat
and called it macaroni</i>

597
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:46,836
- Bravo. Really.
- Thank you.

598
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,502
You're too kind.

599
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,762
Say, George, just one more will do.

600
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:55,702
Thanks.

601
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,186
- How you doing, Nate?
- Hi, Bert.

602
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,722
What's going on? How you been?

603
00:42:00,797 --> 00:42:01,844
Good.

604
00:42:03,036 --> 00:42:04,498
Listen, Nate,

605
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:08,022
do you know this Charlie Bartlett kid?

606
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:11,452
A bit. Why do you ask?

607
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:14,684
You're not gonna like it.

608
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,570
- What?
- Get off the phone.

609
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:21,335
- Hang up the phone.
- Okay.

610
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,641
- Thank you.
- I'll call you right back.

611
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,716
You're gonna shut down this power grid,
please, for one second.

612
00:42:25,788 --> 00:42:27,097
Thank you.

613
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,234
And the TV.

614
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:31,898
Whatever.

615
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:34,419
What?

616
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:37,307
Are you seeing a boy
named Charlie Bartlett?

617
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:38,867
Well, if you know I am,
why are you asking?

618
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:41,013
I don't know, but now I do. Okay?

619
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:42,677
What does he want?

620
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:44,212
Are you drunk?

621
00:42:44,284 --> 00:42:46,107
Do you expect me to qualify that
with an answer?

622
00:42:46,173 --> 00:42:47,798
Be really careful right now.
I'm not kidding.

623
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:49,494
I met this kid. I was a teenage boy once...

624
00:42:49,564 --> 00:42:51,058
You know what? I would understand
if you were drunk, Dad,

625
00:42:51,132 --> 00:42:53,620
- because you're acting like a jackass!
- Sweetie, be open to the possibility

626
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:55,449
that he would love
to tell his friends how he...

627
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,305
Oh, how he what?

628
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:00,598
You know.

629
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:03,124
- No. How he what?
- Yes. You know what.

630
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:05,979
How he... With the principal's daughter.

631
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:07,222
Come on.

632
00:43:08,892 --> 00:43:09,940
Shit.

633
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:15,350
Wow.

634
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:16,882
Thanks for the wonderful
compliment, Dad.

635
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:18,549
Come on, obviously, that came out wrong.

636
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,864
Sure did.

637
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,651
Time to get up, Charlie.

638
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,231
I don't have to go anywhere, Mom.
I'm suspended.

639
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,991
I am aware of that.

640
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,442
Come on. Get dressed.
We're visiting your father today.

641
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,972
Thank you, Thomas.

642
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:24,214
Charlie?

643
00:44:28,348 --> 00:44:30,770
You come in when you're ready, dear.

644
00:44:58,716 --> 00:45:00,309
- Was he worried?
- Nope.

645
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,952
He says, whatever's going on with you,
he's sure you're going to work it out.

646
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,399
Yeah, that sounds about right.

647
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,027
Boy, time flies.

648
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:18,361
How was your 72-hour meditation?

649
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,689
Pretty enlightening.

650
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:23,928
Yeah, I'm proud to say
I'm completely rehabilitated.

651
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:26,810
Very interesting resume, Charlie.

652
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,399
Is there a private school
you haven't been kicked out of?

653
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:32,730
- Why? You checking up on me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

654
00:45:33,213 --> 00:45:34,358
Sorry.

655
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:36,371
Principals have access
to academic records.

656
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:40,503
As you know, I'm the principal,
and as principal I will do my best

657
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:44,631
to help you graduate with
what you will need to survive in the world.

658
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:48,276
But I'm not always the principal.
Sometimes I'm other things.

659
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:49,941
Really? Like what?

660
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:52,087
Like Susan's father.

661
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:54,931
Oh.

662
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:58,331
Don't worry, Charlie,
I'm not gonna call you into my office

663
00:45:58,396 --> 00:46:00,600
and have one of those intimidating
father-boyfriend talks.

664
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:02,555
I'm not that kind of dad.

665
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:03,930
Well, thank you.

666
00:46:03,996 --> 00:46:05,108
Because if I were one of those dads,

667
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,109
I'd probably say how my job
is a distant second to my daughter,

668
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,082
and so help me God, if you get out of line,

669
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:15,866
I will take a massive steaming dump
on your life.

670
00:46:25,564 --> 00:46:27,352
Good to have you back.

671
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:31,480
Hey, Murph.
- Hey.

672
00:46:33,148 --> 00:46:35,155
- Hello.
- Hello.

673
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:40,344
So, how does this work?
Do I just talk, or... Does Murphy listen?

674
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:43,576
Well, he's bound
by a confidentiality agreement.

675
00:46:43,645 --> 00:46:46,011
But he can leave if you want.

676
00:46:46,077 --> 00:46:49,426
- Yeah, maybe just for this first time.
- All right.

677
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,256
Sorry, Murph.

678
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:52,917
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

679
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:55,160
It's not like
I'm your fucking business partner.

680
00:46:55,228 --> 00:46:57,170
So, what did my dad want?

681
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:01,458
He just wanted to welcome me back.

682
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:04,762
He didn't say anything about me
hanging out with you?

683
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,969
Not really.

684
00:47:07,836 --> 00:47:11,513
Maybe the way to do this
is to ask a question.

685
00:47:12,444 --> 00:47:13,873
What question?

686
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,267
Charlie, I don't know.
You're the professional.

687
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,363
All right. Well, I guess the obvious one is
how do you feel about your dad?

688
00:47:22,428 --> 00:47:26,203
You mean, besides the fact that this
stupid job turned him into an alcoholic?

689
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:27,315
Okay.

690
00:47:28,636 --> 00:47:30,643
How do you feel about that?

691
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:34,517
I think it actually bothers him
more than me, to be honest.

692
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:36,628
But there was the night.

693
00:47:37,628 --> 00:47:39,286
What's "the night"?

694
00:47:40,508 --> 00:47:43,290
The night he found out
my mother was having an affair.

695
00:47:43,356 --> 00:47:48,724
He was plastered, waving this. 38 revolver
around, threatening to kill himself.

696
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:52,081
Wow.

697
00:47:55,484 --> 00:47:58,102
So, your mom left and you stayed, right?

698
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:01,333
Yeah, pretty much.

699
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:05,526
Well, he promised to get rid of the gun,

700
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:07,898
and then he went into treatment
for a while.

701
00:48:07,964 --> 00:48:12,339
And then, for whatever reason,
he decided he was into boats.

702
00:48:12,412 --> 00:48:14,070
You know, it's like someone said,

703
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,370
"Hey, you, you're crazy.
Chill out and get a hobby. "

704
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:22,134
- Susan.
- Yes?

705
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:28,533
I'm still waiting for you to tell me
how you feel about your dad.

706
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:29,618
Ah.

707
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,227
You're tough.

708
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:38,581
I guess what I'm trying to say is it just...

709
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:44,626
It kind of sucks having one parent ditch
and then the other one lose their mind.

710
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:55,449
I mean, how can I possibly hope
to turn out even remotely functional?

711
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:00,371
Yeah.

712
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:08,569
Well, I kind of do feel better.

713
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:12,278
I'm glad.

714
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:16,724
Well, thanks for listening, Charlie Bartlett.

715
00:49:16,797 --> 00:49:18,739
No problem, Susan Gardner.

716
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:35,348
Susan?

717
00:50:06,812 --> 00:50:07,827
Hey.

718
00:50:07,996 --> 00:50:09,272
Listen up.

719
00:50:10,236 --> 00:50:12,691
All right, due to the booming economy
of our fine school,

720
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:17,620
Dr. Charlie Bartlett here invites you all
to a private party at the Drive-In Club,

721
00:50:17,692 --> 00:50:21,750
which will be the most raging party
in the history of Western Summit.

722
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:24,921
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

723
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,614
Charlie! Charlie!

724
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,663
<i>Head filled up with fear</i>

725
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:40,114
<i>It's obvious you love the skin you wear</i>

726
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:43,668
<i>I need to lie down
Need some air</i>

727
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,221
<i>Messing and mussing your tie-dyed hair</i>

728
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:52,818
<i>You're making a big mistake, mister</i>

729
00:50:54,588 --> 00:50:56,497
Dustin Lauderbach wants a minute
with you, dude.

730
00:50:56,572 --> 00:51:00,118
Come on, is this really necessary?
I was hoping to get a chance to enjoy this.

731
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:01,781
No, man, he's captain of the football team.

732
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:03,029
All right.

733
00:51:04,316 --> 00:51:08,310
<i>Who's gonna fix that, that voodoo?
Who's gonna fix that, that voodoo?</i>

734
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,479
<i>Who's gonna fix that, that voodoo?
Who's gonna fix that, that voodoo?</i>

735
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:22,677
All right, first of all, I'm sick of football.

736
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:26,963
I mean, zero desire to do this in college.

737
00:51:29,244 --> 00:51:30,324
What do you want to do?

738
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:31,956
Try not to laugh,

739
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:36,401
but I was thinking of
going to Paris to study painting.

740
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:39,411
That's cool.
Have you mentioned this to your dad?

741
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:44,564
No way. Quitting football isn't gonna
go over very well,

742
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:48,466
let alone hitting him up two seconds later
for money to spend a year in France.

743
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,744
Well, what about your mom?

744
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:54,041
She only hears half the stuff I say.
What is that? There's a word for it.

745
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:55,384
Menopause.

746
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:58,490
So, what should I do?

747
00:51:58,556 --> 00:52:04,273
Well, I think one of our duties as teenagers
is to occasionally piss off our parents.

748
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,027
- So, go for it, okay?
- Yeah.

749
00:52:07,612 --> 00:52:08,757
Thanks.

750
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:15,284
I think Dustin Lauderbach may be a...

751
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:19,731
I think you're just jealous 'cause
you don't have any artistic ambitions.

752
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,259
Fuck you, dude. In fifth grade,

753
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:25,463
<i>I played Linus in
You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown. </i>

754
00:52:25,532 --> 00:52:26,579
And I was good.

755
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:27,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

756
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:29,498
Wow, I didn't know that.

757
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,352
If I'm jealous, if,

758
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,209
it's because only guys
like Dustin Lauderbach

759
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,065
can get girls like Whitney Drummond.

760
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:36,757
You wanna hook up
with Whitney Drummond?

761
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:39,578
No. I want to do it right.

762
00:52:40,188 --> 00:52:43,504
That's the kind of girl
you go dinner and a movie with.

763
00:52:44,284 --> 00:52:45,844
I don't know,
you'd have to clean up quite a bit.

764
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,724
Not in this life.

765
00:52:50,652 --> 00:52:53,369
So, why did you stop
doing the school play?

766
00:52:54,044 --> 00:52:56,979
I kept getting my ass kicked
by people like me.

767
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:01,495
Murph, we really have to have
conversations like this more often.

768
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:02,906
Oh, bite me.

769
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:06,641
Here you are. You're coming with me.

770
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:09,497
I am, am I? Where are we going?

771
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:14,455
Well, Dr. Bartlett, I think it's high time
you stepped into my office.

772
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,817
Wow. Beats the hell out of my office.

773
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:01,818
So, what now?

774
00:54:02,652 --> 00:54:05,947
Now I'm going to ask you
a series of questions,

775
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:09,077
and if you answer honestly,
you shall be rewarded.

776
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,609
All right.

777
00:54:11,675 --> 00:54:14,490
All right. Question number one.

778
00:54:15,196 --> 00:54:18,043
And this one is a little selfish on my part.

779
00:54:18,364 --> 00:54:19,793
- Okay.
- Okay.

780
00:54:21,756 --> 00:54:24,822
Is your interest in me
any way related to the fact

781
00:54:24,892 --> 00:54:26,997
that my dad is the principal?

782
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:29,080
What? Why would it be?

783
00:54:29,915 --> 00:54:33,909
Because I know you get a kick out of
doing things that might get you in trouble.

784
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,500
Well, I'm not gonna deny that, but no.

785
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:41,169
I pretty much liked you
from the first moment that I saw you.

786
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,178
And I had no idea who your father was.

787
00:54:55,676 --> 00:54:57,400
Was that my reward?

788
00:54:57,468 --> 00:54:58,678
Mmm-hmm.

789
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,514
I think I'm ready
for the next question then.

790
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:08,665
What's the deal with your father?

791
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:12,499
Does that really have to be
the next question?

792
00:55:12,572 --> 00:55:15,833
Yes. The harder the question,
the greater the reward.

793
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,361
He's in prison.

794
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:30,011
My mom went into
a pretty bad depression

795
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,799
when he got arrested.

796
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:38,353
So, when he was out on bail,
he took me out for ice cream

797
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:42,391
and he told me I had to take care of her.

798
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,610
So, I promised him I would.

799
00:55:48,476 --> 00:55:53,015
And I've been taking care of her ever since.

800
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,194
So, who takes care of you?

801
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:17,109
Susan?

802
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:22,451
I've never done this before.

803
00:56:24,124 --> 00:56:26,262
I know that, Charlie Bartlett.

804
00:56:26,939 --> 00:56:32,341
<i>... I can enjoy this girl-like boy</i>

805
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,908
<i>I'll paint the room white</i>

806
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,933
<i>Just give me something to destroy</i>

807
00:56:44,636 --> 00:56:48,530
<i>You got your green light</i>

808
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:54,648
<i>For us, it's time</i>

809
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:10,193
That's really bad for you, you know?

810
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:20,569
- Hey. What are you doing?
- I'll be right back.

811
00:57:23,804 --> 00:57:25,844
Oh, my God! Charlie, get in here!

812
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:29,431
Ladies and gentlemen,
how are you all doing tonight?

813
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:36,597
My name is Charlie Bartlett
and I am no longer a virgin!

814
00:57:39,612 --> 00:57:41,018
Thank you!

815
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:43,473
For crying out loud.

816
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:49,873
<i>I can't think of any reason
to stay on this planet. </i>

817
00:57:49,947 --> 00:57:52,184
<i>No one at school even knows my name. </i>

818
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:55,416
<i>The idea of even making contact
with another human being</i>

819
00:57:55,484 --> 00:57:57,688
<i>is like trying to defy gravity. </i>

820
00:57:58,043 --> 00:58:00,564
<i>There's just no point in being alive. </i>

821
00:58:57,532 --> 00:59:00,565
Charlie, listen to
what Mr. Gardner has to say.

822
00:59:07,196 --> 00:59:10,840
Kip Crombwell overdosed
on a handful of sedatives last night.

823
00:59:17,275 --> 00:59:18,585
Is he okay?

824
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:21,971
He's okay, yeah.
He's gonna be fine. He's home.

825
00:59:22,044 --> 00:59:23,156
And you might want to thank him later

826
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,682
for not telling his parents
where he got the drugs.

827
00:59:25,755 --> 00:59:29,650
If anyone could prove it was you,
this would be a different story.

828
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,616
Charlie, how could you do
something like this?

829
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:39,891
What happens now?

830
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:41,561
You tell me.

831
00:59:45,403 --> 00:59:49,113
If you can explain what you're doing,
or better yet, why you're doing it,

832
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,187
that would be a good start.

833
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,893
Look, I'm helping these kids, okay?
Nobody else is listening to them.

834
00:59:55,963 --> 00:59:57,873
I encourage you to listen all you like,
but let's face it,

835
00:59:57,947 --> 00:59:59,802
- you're not a professional.
- No.

836
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:01,777
And these medications
have a legitimate use.

837
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:04,307
They've helped a lot of people.
It's a generational thing.

838
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,162
You know, teenagers always find a way
to abuse something.

839
01:00:07,227 --> 01:00:08,569
And why not, right?

840
01:00:08,636 --> 01:00:11,003
Being zonked out of your mind
is a lot more fun

841
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:13,303
than dealing with your problems.

842
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:18,162
Excuse me for asking,
but are you speaking from experience or...

843
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:20,691
You know,
that's not an appropriate question.

844
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:23,184
- That's okay.
- Okay.

845
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:27,446
Yeah, I sought treatment for some issues.

846
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:30,326
You're not doing that anymore?

847
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:34,071
Got to the point where I felt
I was ready to stop, so I did.

848
01:00:34,492 --> 01:00:38,321
- How's that going for you?
- Some days are better than others.

849
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:39,989
Do you want to talk about it sometime?

850
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,994
No, I would not
like to talk about it sometime.

851
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,460
Charlie, come on.

852
01:00:47,388 --> 01:00:49,428
What are you doing this for?

853
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:56,762
I don't know.

854
01:00:57,371 --> 01:00:58,648
I guess...

855
01:01:00,763 --> 01:01:02,552
I'm really happy here.

856
01:01:04,731 --> 01:01:07,317
For the first time, everybody likes me.

857
01:01:08,156 --> 01:01:09,716
There are more important things.

858
01:01:09,787 --> 01:01:13,497
Look, I know. Everybody keeps
saying that, but the thing is, is I'm 17,

859
01:01:13,563 --> 01:01:16,018
and popularity is pretty damn
important to me.

860
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:18,676
Charlie, there are more important things.

861
01:01:18,747 --> 01:01:20,024
Like what?

862
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:23,763
Like what you do with that popularity.

863
01:01:35,547 --> 01:01:39,540
Look, I've been around a while,
you know, long enough to say this.

864
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,417
What you do in this life matters.

865
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:00,438
Hey, Kip.

866
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,841
Hey, Charlie.

867
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:04,598
How are you feeling?

868
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:08,788
Fine, I guess.
They had to pump my stomach.

869
01:02:10,044 --> 01:02:13,655
- How was that?
- Pretty disgusting.

870
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:17,848
But now I get to just
play video games all day, so...

871
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:19,891
Cool.

872
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:25,274
So, are you still,
like, a suicidal maniac or...

873
01:02:27,259 --> 01:02:30,391
Well, it's not like all my problems
just went away.

874
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:33,170
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

875
01:02:33,243 --> 01:02:36,210
Look, Charlie, it's cool
that you came by and everything,

876
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:38,170
but there's really nothing that you can say

877
01:02:38,236 --> 01:02:40,472
that's going to make me
feel any better, so...

878
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:42,099
Nothing? Why not?

879
01:02:42,684 --> 01:02:44,440
No one knows I exist.

880
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:48,562
The last time a girl spoke to me
was in the third grade.

881
01:02:48,635 --> 01:02:51,024
I have no friends and I'm an idiot.

882
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:54,483
You at least have friends.

883
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:57,272
How would you possibly know
what it's like?

884
01:02:58,491 --> 01:03:02,550
- I just think you're missing the big picture.
- What big picture?

885
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:05,718
- The universe.
- What about the universe?

886
01:03:06,971 --> 01:03:09,971
Well, the universe is a pretty big place.

887
01:03:10,043 --> 01:03:12,182
Yeah. It's infinite, theoretically.

888
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:15,764
Right. Which means there's probably
life on other planets.

889
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:20,112
Not life like we think, but, yeah,
probably at least single-cell organisms.

890
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:21,616
Well, see, that's my whole point.

891
01:03:21,692 --> 01:03:24,277
I mean, you could've been born
a single-cell organism

892
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:25,874
on the planet Zortex.

893
01:03:25,947 --> 01:03:28,467
In fact, given the odds,
it's probably more likely.

894
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:31,321
But you weren't.
You were born a human being.

895
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:34,257
And not just any human being
in the history of human beings,

896
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:36,403
but a human being
that gets to be alive today,

897
01:03:36,475 --> 01:03:40,632
that gets to listen to all kinds of music,
that gets to eat food from every culture,

898
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:43,481
that gets to download porn
off the internet.

899
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:48,730
So, really, you have everything to live for.

900
01:03:53,051 --> 01:03:54,578
You feel better?

901
01:03:57,116 --> 01:03:58,425
Not really.

902
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:03,002
Well, at least I tried.

903
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:13,012
<i>- Hey, do you want to play some Killzone?
- Yeah. </i>

904
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:17,044
Dude!

905
01:04:17,243 --> 01:04:21,520
- So, you're not selling drugs anymore?
- No, no. I'm searching for new enterprises.

906
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:24,312
- Like what?
- I don't know. You got any ideas?

907
01:04:24,379 --> 01:04:27,510
You're talking to someone
who can never get anything done.

908
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:31,638
I've been trying to write a play, but,
you know, no one wants to read any of it.

909
01:04:31,707 --> 01:04:33,136
Well, is it any good?

910
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:36,178
I don't know.
You can read it if you want to.

911
01:04:36,859 --> 01:04:37,906
Sure.

912
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:41,746
Nope.

913
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:46,164
Sorry, guys, there's just no way.

914
01:04:46,235 --> 01:04:49,847
- You didn't even read it.
- I read enough to know that it's a bad idea.

915
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:50,898
Why?

916
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:52,727
By virtue of the fact that it's inappropriate.

917
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:54,738
I'm not jazzed about
taking the heat for you two

918
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:56,666
having those kids doing
whatever they're doing in there.

919
01:04:56,731 --> 01:05:00,692
But it's true. It has truth.
It's about us and the way we see things.

920
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:04,538
Mr. Crombwell's right.
We want to see something like this here.

921
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:08,247
Look, it may not be perfect,
but Charlie's gonna help me with it.

922
01:05:08,315 --> 01:05:10,933
Great. That really puts my mind at ease.

923
01:05:11,963 --> 01:05:14,352
Look, I'm really trying
to do the right thing, okay?

924
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:16,249
I thought that's what
you wanted me to do.

925
01:05:16,315 --> 01:05:19,162
Yeah, I do,
but does it have to be this play?

926
01:05:22,587 --> 01:05:24,856
If it helps your decision,

927
01:05:24,923 --> 01:05:28,666
I'd be considerably less likely
to end my life if you said yes.

928
01:05:37,051 --> 01:05:39,670
You've got to get it through Drama Club.

929
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:43,445
- Thank you, Mr. Gardner.
- Yeah.

930
01:05:43,515 --> 01:05:45,457
You won't be disappointed.

931
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:47,953
Don't make me regret this.

932
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,484
So, what do we do now?

933
01:05:50,555 --> 01:05:54,199
Well, don't worry about the Drama Club.
I'll work it out.

934
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:57,336
I kind of just don't know
what to say, Charlie.

935
01:05:57,403 --> 01:05:58,865
No worries.

936
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,336
Don't fucking argue with me.

937
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:02,832
Listen, I just wanna remind you
how much this is worth!

938
01:06:02,907 --> 01:06:04,249
- I know.
- Let me keep the Xanax.

939
01:06:04,315 --> 01:06:06,803
- No. No Xanax. Everything.
- Charlie...

940
01:06:13,275 --> 01:06:14,868
You're a dick.

941
01:06:19,515 --> 01:06:20,922
No! No! No!

942
01:06:20,987 --> 01:06:24,118
- Murph, give it to me.
- No! No! No, Charlie! No! No!

943
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:31,254
Excuse me, everyone.

944
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:33,875
May I have your attention?
I have an announcement to make.

945
01:06:36,315 --> 01:06:39,479
Due to complications
with the insurance companies,

946
01:06:41,371 --> 01:06:43,510
I will no longer be providing medication.

947
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:49,841
I'm sure this will mean that a lot of you
are done speaking to me and that's fine.

948
01:06:49,915 --> 01:06:53,396
However, for those of you
that are still interested,

949
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:57,329
I will be holding sessions in my office
free of charge.

950
01:06:58,427 --> 01:06:59,703
Thank you.

951
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:12,112
I'm one of those people
not speaking to you.

952
01:07:20,187 --> 01:07:22,805
Well, let's get started, shall we?

953
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:33,718
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Whitney. What's going on?

954
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:36,882
I don't know.

955
01:07:36,955 --> 01:07:39,923
Well, I think you have
something to tell me,

956
01:07:39,995 --> 01:07:42,515
but you're worried what I might think.

957
01:07:43,547 --> 01:07:44,725
I guess.

958
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:49,330
I really think that
there's something wrong with me.

959
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:50,744
Why is that?

960
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,430
Well, I've been crying a lot.

961
01:07:53,947 --> 01:07:55,408
Like, at cheer.

962
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:01,434
I've slept with almost every guy
on the football team.

963
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,921
All of them?

964
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:08,183
Well, maybe not all.

965
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,222
But all the backfield, anyway.

966
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:15,352
Well, do you like any of these guys?

967
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:17,847
Not really.

968
01:08:18,459 --> 01:08:22,004
I mean, I know they don't want to be
my boyfriend or anything lame like that.

969
01:08:22,075 --> 01:08:25,621
But they try to sleep with me,
and I don't want to say no to them.

970
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:30,426
Well, look, I don't know, maybe you should
take it slower, you know?

971
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:32,182
Enjoy yourself.

972
01:08:32,251 --> 01:08:35,447
I mean, there are plenty of guys
at this school

973
01:08:35,515 --> 01:08:38,832
that would do anything to take you
to dinner and a movie.

974
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,849
Give me a break. Like who?

975
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,805
- Hey, Whitney.
- Hi, Murphy.

976
01:08:47,227 --> 01:08:49,594
Wow, you actually brought flowers.

977
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,569
They're pretty lame, huh?

978
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:58,170
- I've never been on a real date before.
- That's okay, Murphy.

979
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:01,050
I've never been on a real date
before either.

980
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:15,258
- By the way, I like your shirt.
- Oh, thanks.

981
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:18,197
Okay. Thanks, Charlie.

982
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:22,072
- Hey.
- Hey, Henry. How's it going, man?

983
01:09:22,139 --> 01:09:25,139
The board completely ignored the petition
to get the cameras out of the lounge,

984
01:09:25,211 --> 01:09:26,869
so they've basically blown us off.

985
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,313
Next thing you know,
they'll put in metal detectors

986
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:30,451
and start doing random locker searches.

987
01:09:30,523 --> 01:09:32,432
We have to do something.
We need you, man.

988
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:35,922
I don't know, Henry.
I am already on thin ice with Gardner.

989
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:39,257
If I lead a protest,
I think he'll have me assassinated.

990
01:09:39,323 --> 01:09:41,047
We need to do something.

991
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:42,708
All right, look,
if you want to lead a protest,

992
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,429
it's not like I'm gonna stop you, but...

993
01:09:45,498 --> 01:09:47,025
Thanks, Charlie.

994
01:09:55,706 --> 01:09:58,489
<i>This is a school, not a prison. </i>

995
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:02,262
Thanks, because I couldn't read the sign.

996
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,567
<i>This is a school, not a prison. </i>

997
01:10:05,595 --> 01:10:08,017
<i>This is a school, it's not a prison. </i>

998
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:11,063
<i>This is a school, not a prison. </i>

999
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:13,720
<i>This is a school, it's not a prison. </i>

1000
01:10:28,059 --> 01:10:30,993
<i>Cameras, protests,
insubordinate kids. </i>

1001
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:33,937
Would any of this have happened
without Charlie Bartlett?

1002
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,116
He's all I hear about these days.

1003
01:10:36,187 --> 01:10:38,041
"Charlie Bartlett told my son this.

1004
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:40,757
"Charlie Bartlett told my daughter
to do that. "

1005
01:10:40,826 --> 01:10:44,372
Our lives would be a whole lot easier
if we just expelled him.

1006
01:10:45,403 --> 01:10:48,021
You really think that's what he deserves?

1007
01:10:48,091 --> 01:10:51,222
Do yourself a favor.
Don't get fired over this kid.

1008
01:10:56,347 --> 01:10:57,426
Look at this.

1009
01:10:57,498 --> 01:11:00,116
Look, I don't think there should
be cameras in the lounge, but...

1010
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:03,220
I don't even know what to say.

1011
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:05,680
I kind of see where
your dad's coming from, too.

1012
01:11:05,755 --> 01:11:07,926
Since when do you care what he thinks?

1013
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:11,508
I don't know.
He's given me a break a couple of times.

1014
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:12,626
Yeah.

1015
01:11:15,835 --> 01:11:19,763
<i>Attention, all dissenting students
of Western Summit High School. </i>

1016
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:22,103
<i>You have two minutes to disperse. </i>

1017
01:11:22,171 --> 01:11:24,080
<i>If you have not at that time,
you will be suspended. </i>

1018
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:27,450
No! See, we have a right to be here.
They can't kick us all out.

1019
01:11:27,514 --> 01:11:30,231
There has to be a better way
to handle this.

1020
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:33,113
- Okay. Can you help me out?
- What are you gonna do?

1021
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:36,790
Could you go over there and tell them
to break it up and come back tonight?

1022
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:37,906
Okay.

1023
01:11:39,386 --> 01:11:42,201
This is a school, not a prison!
This is a school, not a prison!

1024
01:11:42,266 --> 01:11:45,615
Hey, guys, Charlie wanted me to ask...

1025
01:11:50,714 --> 01:11:54,326
Charlie wants us to go home
and come back tonight, all right?

1026
01:12:46,746 --> 01:12:47,859
Susan!

1027
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:52,697
- What did he just give you?
- What?

1028
01:12:52,762 --> 01:12:55,577
- That's just...
- Shut it! I'm talking to my daughter.

1029
01:12:55,642 --> 01:12:58,228
- What is in that pharmacy bag?
- None of your business.

1030
01:12:58,299 --> 01:13:00,787
- Susan...
- I don't need any assistance from you

1031
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:02,768
handling my daughter.
Do you understand?

1032
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:05,942
Try saying one more word
and see what happens.

1033
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:07,953
Come on, you really think
I don't know what's in the bag?

1034
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:10,809
Yeah. I really don't think
you know what's in the bag.

1035
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,730
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere.

1036
01:13:12,795 --> 01:13:13,810
Whatever.

1037
01:13:13,882 --> 01:13:17,363
Susan Gardner, get your ass
back in the house on the count of three,

1038
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,093
or you're grounded.

1039
01:13:19,611 --> 01:13:22,000
What makes you think
you're still in control of what I do?

1040
01:13:22,075 --> 01:13:26,581
I don't think. I know. It's a fact.
What are you looking at? One!

1041
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,552
I would not make me choose
between you and Charlie if I were you.

1042
01:13:29,627 --> 01:13:32,529
You don't have to choose.
Drug dealer! Dad!

1043
01:13:32,603 --> 01:13:36,312
I'm your father.
This is a boy who goes to my school. Two!

1044
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:39,445
Charlie Bartlett has done more
for your school than you ever will.

1045
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,529
Three!

1046
01:13:40,602 --> 01:13:42,326
Hey! Don't touch her!

1047
01:13:44,602 --> 01:13:46,774
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

1048
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:50,388
Well, you did it. It's done.

1049
01:13:51,962 --> 01:13:54,002
Whatever. Let's go. Come on.

1050
01:14:20,443 --> 01:14:22,483
I'm really sorry I did that.

1051
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:26,293
It's not your fault.

1052
01:14:27,706 --> 01:14:30,128
So, Charlie Bartlett assaulted you.

1053
01:14:30,682 --> 01:14:34,392
Well, now it's up to you.
Do you want to press charges or not?

1054
01:14:38,747 --> 01:14:40,722
<i>Now, we're
gonna get these cameras out of the lounge. </i>

1055
01:14:40,794 --> 01:14:43,031
<i>We're gonna figure it out tonight. </i>

1056
01:14:43,098 --> 01:14:45,553
<i>Hey, look who it is, everybody. </i>

1057
01:14:45,626 --> 01:14:49,554
<i>Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!</i>

1058
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:00,719
<i>How you all doing tonight?</i>

1059
01:15:02,618 --> 01:15:04,920
<i>My name is Charlie Bartlett. </i>

1060
01:15:09,147 --> 01:15:12,976
<i>If there's one thing I want you guys
to walk away with tonight, </i>

1061
01:15:21,627 --> 01:15:24,016
<i>it's that you guys don't need me. </i>

1062
01:15:25,306 --> 01:15:26,867
<i>I really mean it. </i>

1063
01:15:27,195 --> 01:15:30,195
<i>You think I'm any less screwed up
than you are?</i>

1064
01:15:30,267 --> 01:15:34,063
<i>I get up every morning
and I look in the mirror</i>

1065
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:37,081
<i>and I try and figure out</i>

1066
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:40,662
<i>just where I fit in. </i>

1067
01:15:42,395 --> 01:15:46,704
<i>And I draw a complete blank. </i>

1068
01:15:48,954 --> 01:15:52,250
<i>And you guys are looking to me
to tell you what to do?</i>

1069
01:15:52,955 --> 01:15:56,053
<i>You need to stop listening to me. </i>

1070
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:02,934
<i>And stop listening to people telling you
who you should be. </i>

1071
01:16:03,002 --> 01:16:05,010
<i>And stop listening to the people
that are telling you</i>

1072
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,155
<i>you're not good enough
to do the things that you want to do!</i>

1073
01:16:08,282 --> 01:16:09,558
<i>You guys have all the answers. </i>

1074
01:16:09,627 --> 01:16:10,936
You're under arrest for assault.

1075
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:19,321
Charlie!

1076
01:16:36,954 --> 01:16:39,737
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

1077
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:42,585
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

1078
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:45,781
<i>Okay, party's over.
I want you all out of here now!</i>

1079
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:49,041
<i>Have I made myself abundantly clear?</i>

1080
01:16:49,114 --> 01:16:50,641
We want to know
what the hell's gonna happen to Charlie.

1081
01:16:50,715 --> 01:16:51,663
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1082
01:16:51,738 --> 01:16:53,265
<i>I'd be more worried about yourselves. </i>

1083
01:16:53,339 --> 01:16:56,405
<i>Thanks to him,
the Class of '83 Student Lounge</i>

1084
01:16:56,475 --> 01:16:58,962
<i>is now The Charlie Bartlett
Detention Center. </i>

1085
01:16:59,034 --> 01:17:01,206
Bullshit! Come on!

1086
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,250
Get the cameras!

1087
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:10,262
<i>Well, every time I feel you're
coming round, you're going down</i>

1088
01:17:10,394 --> 01:17:15,129
<i>You hit the ground with every force
It makes no sense or sound</i>

1089
01:17:15,386 --> 01:17:16,630
Emergency, Western Summit High School.

1090
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:23,770
<i>God bless your soul, girl
Now you got the whole world</i>

1091
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:26,005
<i>It's your eyes that make me smile</i>

1092
01:17:26,139 --> 01:17:28,244
<i>Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah</i>

1093
01:17:29,946 --> 01:17:32,794
Well, I guess now is as good a time
as any to tell you.

1094
01:17:32,859 --> 01:17:34,320
You're fired.

1095
01:17:35,546 --> 01:17:37,269
<i>It's your eyes that make me smile</i>

1096
01:17:37,338 --> 01:17:38,745
Come on.

1097
01:17:39,546 --> 01:17:42,034
<i>Wasting time hanging out</i>

1098
01:17:42,138 --> 01:17:44,146
<i>Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah</i>

1099
01:17:57,754 --> 01:18:00,820
Come on, Charlie.
Your mom's here to bail you out.

1100
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,345
What's gonna happen to the other kids?

1101
01:18:03,419 --> 01:18:05,524
Well, there's gonna be an investigation.

1102
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:07,001
But since all the cameras were destroyed,

1103
01:18:07,067 --> 01:18:10,645
they're gonna have a hard time
figuring out who did what.

1104
01:18:10,714 --> 01:18:13,649
Well, I'm prepared
to take full responsibility.

1105
01:18:14,362 --> 01:18:15,889
Charlie, go home.

1106
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:23,506
- Are you mad?
- I don't know how to feel, Charlie.

1107
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:26,645
Well, Mom, I think you should be mad
because I just got arrested

1108
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:28,787
and a bunch of my friends
just trashed a building.

1109
01:18:28,858 --> 01:18:30,713
I am aware of that.

1110
01:18:30,778 --> 01:18:35,153
And I'm having a hard time being mad
at you when it just might be my fault.

1111
01:18:35,867 --> 01:18:38,354
No, Mom, it's not your fault.
Don't say that.

1112
01:18:38,426 --> 01:18:40,019
No, some of it is.

1113
01:18:41,019 --> 01:18:45,077
I treated you like an adult for so long,
you missed out on being a little boy.

1114
01:18:45,146 --> 01:18:47,350
And now we're paying for it.

1115
01:18:47,418 --> 01:18:49,360
With a vengeance, I'd say.

1116
01:18:49,786 --> 01:18:52,023
But you are just a kid, Charlie.

1117
01:18:52,826 --> 01:18:54,834
You understand that, right?

1118
01:18:56,858 --> 01:19:00,949
And that doesn't change just
because I don't know what to do with you.

1119
01:19:01,626 --> 01:19:02,739
Mom.

1120
01:19:03,451 --> 01:19:06,168
I wouldn't know
what to do with me, either.

1121
01:19:09,115 --> 01:19:11,765
Well, I think it's safe to say
that you're grounded.

1122
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:13,623
Really? How long?

1123
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:17,431
That's a good question.
What is the standard?

1124
01:19:17,499 --> 01:19:19,506
Usually, like, 24 hours.

1125
01:19:20,475 --> 01:19:24,566
Well, seeing as you've acquired
a misdemeanor, we'd better make it 30.

1126
01:19:25,338 --> 01:19:26,385
Okay.

1127
01:19:34,554 --> 01:19:36,376
- Get in the car.
- Okay.

1128
01:20:41,498 --> 01:20:43,124
- Hi.
- Hey!

1129
01:20:45,498 --> 01:20:46,927
How are you feeling?

1130
01:20:47,002 --> 01:20:49,871
A little nervous, I guess. But that's normal.

1131
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:52,695
Yeah. How's your dad?

1132
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:56,271
He's holed himself up in his study.

1133
01:20:56,954 --> 01:20:58,896
That's usually a bad sign.

1134
01:20:59,386 --> 01:21:01,012
You could've asked him to come,
you know.

1135
01:21:01,082 --> 01:21:02,805
Really? What am I going to say?

1136
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:05,111
"Hey, Dad, you want to come
sit with a bunch of people

1137
01:21:05,178 --> 01:21:08,145
"that are really glad you were fired
and watch me on stage?"

1138
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:25,939
Hello?

1139
01:21:30,042 --> 01:21:31,286
Hello?

1140
01:21:32,474 --> 01:21:34,067
Principal Gardner?

1141
01:21:34,938 --> 01:21:37,752
Hello? Principal Gardner?

1142
01:21:39,514 --> 01:21:41,718
It's me, sir. Charlie Bartlett.

1143
01:21:43,514 --> 01:21:44,529
Hello?

1144
01:21:46,298 --> 01:21:47,476
Hello?

1145
01:21:48,506 --> 01:21:50,873
Oh, this better be good, Charles.

1146
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:55,122
I came to invite you to the play.

1147
01:21:55,195 --> 01:21:59,188
Well, thank you for that,
but I am just a little tied up right now.

1148
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:03,088
- What are you doing?
- Venting. Just venting a little bit.

1149
01:22:03,162 --> 01:22:05,431
Is that your new word of the day?

1150
01:22:05,498 --> 01:22:06,447
Sure as shit is.

1151
01:22:07,642 --> 01:22:09,944
Word of the day, "venting. "

1152
01:22:10,394 --> 01:22:15,184
Explanation. That's kind of how I deal
with my little life's frustrations. I vent.

1153
01:22:15,258 --> 01:22:19,251
<i>As in "to vent, " original derivation
from the Latin exventare. </i>

1154
01:22:19,322 --> 01:22:20,729
Jesus!

1155
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,342
Everybody needs to vent a little
now and again, don't you figure?

1156
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:27,257
Some of us are privileged enough
to vent to you in the boys' room stall,

1157
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:29,875
and the rest of us just have to settle
for less conventional methods.

1158
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:31,768
Like, I don't know,
a bottle of booze and a handgun.

1159
01:22:33,786 --> 01:22:37,496
I'm sorry. I'm not putting you on edge
with my behavior, am I?

1160
01:22:37,978 --> 01:22:39,636
That's all right.

1161
01:22:40,218 --> 01:22:41,744
Maybe you could put the gun down.

1162
01:22:41,818 --> 01:22:45,167
Park it, Chuck!
In case you're not aware of this,

1163
01:22:45,242 --> 01:22:47,762
I'm entirely displeased with you right now.

1164
01:22:47,834 --> 01:22:49,689
I was racking my brain to figure out why,

1165
01:22:49,754 --> 01:22:52,307
and I think it's because
you've taken everything from me.

1166
01:22:52,378 --> 01:22:54,069
Why did you do that?

1167
01:22:55,546 --> 01:22:58,197
Do you have anything enlightening
to say to me right now? 'Cause if you do,

1168
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:00,917
I'd appreciate it if you'd spit it out.

1169
01:23:00,986 --> 01:23:02,131
I don't know.

1170
01:23:02,202 --> 01:23:05,300
Maybe some of
that post-pubescent psychobabble?

1171
01:23:06,234 --> 01:23:08,242
Maybe a pearl of wisdom?

1172
01:23:08,314 --> 01:23:10,485
I don't know what to say to you.

1173
01:23:10,554 --> 01:23:13,685
I mean, I don't know how to help you.
I really want to.

1174
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:16,023
Come on, Doctor!
What have you got for me?

1175
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:18,162
I don't know what you want from me.

1176
01:23:18,234 --> 01:23:22,390
I don't need you to say anything to me
and I don't need you to save me!

1177
01:23:23,386 --> 01:23:25,557
All right, then, what am I supposed to do
in this situation?

1178
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:29,041
You know, I'm just a kid!
I'm just a stupid kid!

1179
01:23:30,202 --> 01:23:33,944
Stop the fucking presses.
Run that by me again. You're a what?

1180
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,472
I'm just a kid.

1181
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,420
I get it.

1182
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,561
It's tough. I was a kid once, too.

1183
01:23:44,058 --> 01:23:45,268
Oh, fuck!

1184
01:23:58,681 --> 01:23:59,696
- No!
- What are you...

1185
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:24,113
What the hell did you do that for?

1186
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,992
You were going to kill yourself.

1187
01:24:27,066 --> 01:24:30,449
I can't kill myself.
I've got too many responsibilities.

1188
01:24:32,954 --> 01:24:34,164
You okay?

1189
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:36,658
Yeah.

1190
01:24:38,746 --> 01:24:42,740
Never, never attack a drunk guy
with a gun. Do you understand?

1191
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,217
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1192
01:24:45,946 --> 01:24:48,815
Come on. Let's get cleaned up.

1193
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:51,602
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1194
01:24:53,306 --> 01:24:55,694
Hey, Charlie. See if that fits.

1195
01:24:57,338 --> 01:24:59,029
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1196
01:25:01,114 --> 01:25:03,383
How's your head? You all right?

1197
01:25:04,154 --> 01:25:05,431
It's okay.

1198
01:25:06,489 --> 01:25:09,588
Well, we should go
'cause we're going to miss the play.

1199
01:25:09,658 --> 01:25:12,505
I doubt she's going to be happy to see me.

1200
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:16,083
No, you're her father,

1201
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:19,983
and she loves you very much,
and you're totally missing it.

1202
01:25:26,202 --> 01:25:27,543
Fair enough.

1203
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:32,600
- What about you?
- What about me, what?

1204
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:35,128
What about your father?

1205
01:25:35,866 --> 01:25:38,484
You know, when I checked up on you,
I was half-hoping to find something

1206
01:25:38,554 --> 01:25:41,620
to make me feel justified
in kicking your ass out.

1207
01:25:43,386 --> 01:25:45,589
Then I found out about him.

1208
01:25:49,498 --> 01:25:52,018
There are worse crimes than tax evasion.

1209
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,123
Yeah, but it's not worth
losing your father over.

1210
01:25:56,122 --> 01:25:58,839
Okay, so, stay mad at him forever.

1211
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,777
How's that working for you?

1212
01:26:03,194 --> 01:26:05,495
Some days are better than others.

1213
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:14,326
Come on, Monica. Just try it.
It'll give you such a high.

1214
01:26:14,394 --> 01:26:16,915
My God, you are, like,
totally peer-pressuring me.

1215
01:26:16,986 --> 01:26:18,742
I've never done it before.

1216
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:21,527
Just do it. Trust me.
You know you want to.

1217
01:26:23,226 --> 01:26:26,423
I just don't know anymore.
She used to be my little girl.

1218
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:29,173
I mean, what do you think
they're doing behind that door?

1219
01:26:29,242 --> 01:26:30,868
There's no way to know that.

1220
01:26:30,938 --> 01:26:35,411
And, besides, isn't it more interesting
to just trust them and see what happens?

1221
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:40,599
I just don't understand why it's
so important to you that I do this.

1222
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:43,154
'Cause it's fun and it'll feel good.

1223
01:26:44,921 --> 01:26:46,831
Okay, I'll give it a try.

1224
01:26:58,618 --> 01:27:02,808
<i>If you wanna sing out, sing out</i>

1225
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:08,304
<i>If you wanna be free, be free</i>

1226
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:14,261
<i>There's a million things to be</i>

1227
01:27:15,002 --> 01:27:18,711
<i>You know that there are</i>

1228
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:24,184
<i>If you wanna live high, live high</i>

1229
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:29,876
<i>If you wanna live low, live low</i>

1230
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:35,537
<i>There's a million ways to go</i>

1231
01:27:35,962 --> 01:27:39,158
<i>You know that there are</i>

1232
01:27:42,009 --> 01:27:45,806
<i>You can do what you want</i>

1233
01:27:47,546 --> 01:27:51,026
<i>The opportunity's on</i>

1234
01:27:52,985 --> 01:27:57,295
<i>And if you find a new way</i>

1235
01:27:59,002 --> 01:28:03,028
<i>You can do it today</i>

1236
01:28:04,634 --> 01:28:07,983
<i>You can make it all true</i>

1237
01:28:10,138 --> 01:28:13,683
<i>And you can make it undo</i>

1238
01:28:13,753 --> 01:28:15,957
<i>You see</i>

1239
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:23,958
<i>You only need to know</i>

1240
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:31,766
<i>If you wanna say yes, say yes</i>

1241
01:28:33,145 --> 01:28:37,401
<i>If you wanna say no, say no</i>

1242
01:28:38,809 --> 01:28:43,065
<i>There's a million ways to go</i>

1243
01:28:43,578 --> 01:28:47,352
<i>You know that there are</i>

1244
01:28:48,538 --> 01:28:52,335
<i>You know that there are</i>

1245
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:04,373
I must say, of all the kids
applying for a summer internship,

1246
01:29:04,442 --> 01:29:06,995
you have quite a checkered history.

1247
01:29:07,066 --> 01:29:09,684
I understand. And I'm sure
you have a whole stack of people

1248
01:29:09,754 --> 01:29:13,910
with perfect backgrounds
and no disciplinary record.

1249
01:29:16,922 --> 01:29:19,889
Really, I'd do anything to work here.

1250
01:29:19,962 --> 01:29:24,402
Well, let's get on with the interview.
I've got a hell of a day ahead of me.

1251
01:29:25,018 --> 01:29:27,254
Would you like to talk about it?

1252
01:29:29,466 --> 01:29:32,248
<i>Do you know what it's like
to fall on the floor?</i>

1253
01:29:32,378 --> 01:29:34,930
<i>And cry your guts out
till you got no more?</i>

1254
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:38,545
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1255
01:29:39,097 --> 01:29:41,716
<i>Have you ever made love
to a beautiful girl?</i>

1256
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,562
<i>Made you feel like
it's not such a bad world?</i>

1257
01:29:44,762 --> 01:29:48,373
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1258
01:29:48,474 --> 01:29:51,191
<i>Now you're really
giving it everything</i>

1259
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:54,004
<i>And you're really
getting all you gave</i>

1260
01:29:54,234 --> 01:29:58,195
<i>Now you're really living
what this life is all about</i>

1261
01:29:59,674 --> 01:30:02,488
<i>Well, I just saw the sun
rise over the hill</i>

1262
01:30:02,681 --> 01:30:05,103
<i>Never used to give me
much of a thrill</i>

1263
01:30:05,178 --> 01:30:09,007
<i>But hey, man
Now I'm really living</i>

1264
01:30:18,809 --> 01:30:21,657
<i>Do you know what it's like
to care too much</i>

1265
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:24,274
<i>'Bout someone that you're
never gonna get to touch?</i>

1266
01:30:24,569 --> 01:30:28,246
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1267
01:30:28,314 --> 01:30:31,128
<i>Have you ever sat down
in the fresh-cut grass</i>

1268
01:30:31,194 --> 01:30:33,976
<i>And thought about the moment
and when it will pass?</i>

1269
01:30:34,105 --> 01:30:37,750
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1270
01:30:37,882 --> 01:30:40,370
<i>Now you're really
giving it everything</i>

1271
01:30:40,442 --> 01:30:42,831
<i>And you're really
getting all you gave</i>

1272
01:30:42,905 --> 01:30:47,062
<i>Now you're really living
what this life is all about</i>

1273
01:30:49,306 --> 01:30:51,695
<i>Now, what would you say
if I told you that</i>

1274
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:54,552
<i>Everyone thinks
you're a crazy old cat</i>

1275
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:58,294
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1276
01:30:58,617 --> 01:31:01,334
<i>Do you know what it's like
to fall on the floor?</i>

1277
01:31:01,466 --> 01:31:04,084
<i>And cry your guts out
till you got no more?</i>

1278
01:31:04,537 --> 01:31:07,886
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1279
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:10,872
<i>Have you ever made love
to a beautiful girl?</i>

1280
01:31:11,001 --> 01:31:13,685
<i>Made you feel like
it's not such a bad world?</i>

1281
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:17,199
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1282
01:31:17,273 --> 01:31:20,569
<i>Do you know what it's like
to fall on the floor?</i>

1283
01:31:20,634 --> 01:31:23,449
<i>And cry your guts out

1284
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:27,188
<i>Hey, man
Now you're really living</i>

1285
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:30,100
<i>Just saw the sun rise over the hill</i>

1286
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:32,952
<i>Never used to give me much of a thrill</i>

1287
01:31:33,017 --> 01:31:37,223
<i>But hey, man
Now I'm really living!</i>
