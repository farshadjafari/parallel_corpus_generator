1
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,286
<i>Tension that had been brewing for</i>
<i>months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...</i>

2
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,662
<i>... as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu</i>
<i>orchestrated a swift and violent coup...</i>

3
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:38,204
<i>... against the democratically elected</i>
<i>government of President Samuel Azuka.</i>

4
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:42,605
<i>In the land with 120 million people</i>
<i>and over 250 ethnic groups...</i>

5
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:45,541
<i>... there'd been a long history</i>
<i>of ethnic enmity...</i>

6
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:50,241
<i>... particularly between northern Fulani</i>
<i>Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.</i>

7
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:53,612
<i>The victorious Fulani rebels</i>
<i>have taken to the streets...</i>

8
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:57,383
<i>... as outbursts of violence</i>
<i>continue all over the country.</i>

9
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:02,620
<i>Thousands have been killed in</i>
<i>the fighting or executed thereafter.</i>

10
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:06,563
<i>Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo</i>
<i>have abandoned their homes...</i>

11
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:11,068
<i>... and are fleeing the city or searching</i>
<i>for sanctuary wherever they may find it.</i>

12
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,470
<i>Gen. Yakubu has taken control</i>
<i>of most of the country...</i>

13
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:16,405
<i>... and appears firmly in charge.</i>

14
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,478
<i>There's no word on the United Nations'</i>
<i>reaction to the coup...</i>

15
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:23,640
<i>... but United States forces have already</i>
<i>begun to evacuate its embassy.</i>

16
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,903
As you can see behind me,
on the <i>USS Harry S. Truman...</i>

17
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:50,577
...activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over Nigeria.

18
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:52,337
This once peaceful country...

19
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:57,075
...has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles...

20
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:00,516
...mainly over control
of Nigeria's vast oil supply.

21
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:03,049
However, nothing can prepare
the country...

22
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:07,694
...for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place.

23
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:14,092
We have just heard
that the entire presidential family...

24
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:16,532
...has been assassinated.
I repeat:

25
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:20,333
The entire presidential family
has been assassinated.

26
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,555
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.
- Thank you.

27
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,228
Let me take those for you.

28
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,460
He got one in the leg!

29
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,560
Put him in the sickbay now!

30
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,239
Well, look at you.

31
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,169
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

32
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:59,404
We appreciate you've been humping out
there, but we have to put you back in.

33
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:04,511
Priority tasking. We need to extract
a critical personality ASAP.

34
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,085
Now get some chow,
refit for a three-day LLRP.

35
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:11,252
See you in chow to debrief.
You...

36
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,060
...go see the medic.
- Aye, captain.

37
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:24,568
Attention on deck.

38
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,299
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.

39
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,909
Everybody get chow?

40
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,242
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

41
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:40,581
Now, intel estimates
5000 Yakubu troops...

42
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:41,812
...scattered throughout this sector.

43
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,289
They've captured
government armories...

44
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,589
...and unfortunately, we have been
supplying them for far too many years.

45
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:56,765
In addition, the local militia are killing
anyone who goes to a different church.

46
00:04:56,971 --> 00:05:00,566
All right, now, your prime objective
is to find and extract...

47
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:05,405
...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with
International Relief Services.

48
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:08,146
Dr. Kendricks is an American
by marriage.

49
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,408
Her late husband
was Dr. John Kendricks.

50
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:12,985
Your secondary objective...

51
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:16,612
...is to extract two nuns and a priest
who run a feel-good near Yolingo...

52
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:18,758
...if they so choose to leave.

53
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:21,292
St. Michael's Mission, right here.

54
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,258
You will halo over Cameroon...

55
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:26,889
...and float into your DZ near the edge
of the Mazon Rain Forest.

56
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:28,296
When you get your package...

57
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:32,599
...you will proceed
to your extract LZ Alpha.

58
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,766
Our presence on the ground
will be considered hostile.

59
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,908
- Questions?
- Sir...

60
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,207
...rules of engagement?

61
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,682
You will defend yourselves if you're
fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.

62
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,818
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion
plan?

63
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:51,458
Patrol the Cameroon border
through the Tandjile Pass.

64
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:54,284
Anything else, gentlemen?

65
00:05:57,131 --> 00:05:58,120
All right.

66
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,289
Dismissed.

67
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,308
Gentlemen, three minutes out.

68
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,945
It's okay. It's okay.

69
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,582
You speak English?
You speak English?

70
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,241
Good. Good.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

71
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,418
Are there any soldiers here?
Any rebel soldiers?

72
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,922
You sure? You sure?

73
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:08,220
Good. Good. Can you take me
to Dr. Lena Kendricks?

74
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,330
Do you know who she is?
Okay, here we go.

75
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,523
Nice and easy. Come on.

76
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,594
Zee, we're moving.

77
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,599
It's all right. I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

78
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:33,114
Open.

79
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:42,317
Clear.

80
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,983
Lasana, where's that wa...?

81
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:11,249
These American men are here
to see you!

82
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy.
I'm here to get you and your people out.

83
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,998
We're in the middle of surgery here.

84
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,429
Ma'am, you don't realize
what's about to happen here.

85
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,432
Are you a nun?
Are you one of the nuns?

86
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:24,001
- Are you a nun, ma'am?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:27,231
Good. Pack your things
and let's get out of here now.

88
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:28,397
- Lieutenant!
- Ma'am.

89
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:33,043
Get those weapons out
of my operating room.

90
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,872
You're frightening my staff.

91
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:39,716
I'll be with you when I'm done.
Now please wait outside!

92
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,785
Your staff should be frightened,
ma'am.

93
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,323
Do you know what'll happen to you
and these women when rebels get here?

94
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,622
Doc, maybe you can help her out.

95
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,892
Ma'am, may I assist?

96
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,703
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a corpsman, ma'am.

97
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:59,968
- Can you stitch?
- Yes, ma'am.

98
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:02,198
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he's sure.

99
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,774
Then close for me.

100
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,549
We're taking our good old time here.

101
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,219
All right, Lt. Waters, I'm all yours.

102
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,553
Hurry up, Doc.

103
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:30,064
I assume you have a plan
to get us all out of here?

104
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,171
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.

105
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,672
We've got a 12-klick hike to make
to rendezvous to the helicopter.

106
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,071
Get your things together,
but pack light.

107
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:43,076
Zee, bring your perimeter up.
Keep Flea in place.

108
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:46,014
We spotted a rebel company
outside of Yolingo on the way in.

109
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,917
We must assume they'll be here
by night, if not sooner.

110
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:53,025
I'm responsible for 70 people here, more
than half of them seriously wounded.

111
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,027
My orders are to evacuate
foreign nationals only, ma'am.

112
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,755
What does that mean?

113
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:00,264
I mean nonindigenous personnel,
ma'am.

114
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:01,696
Then we have a problem.

115
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:06,431
I will not leave without
the indigenous personnel.

116
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:10,668
We're here to get you out.
Now, I suggest you go find the priest...

117
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,711
...go find the nuns, pack your things
and prepare to move.

118
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:18,284
When the rebel troops get here,
they'll kill everything they see...

119
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:20,443
...including privileged white doctors.

120
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:23,784
- What part of that plan don't you get?
- The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!

121
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:27,154
- You could fly them out in 30 minutes!
- Can't do that.

122
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:29,228
- Why not?
- Because my orders are very clear:

123
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:34,060
Evacuate the priest, you and the two
nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.

124
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,465
We can take those who can walk.

125
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:39,470
They're not my responsibility.
You are my responsibility.

126
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,474
You're right, lieutenant...

127
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,048
...it's not your problem.
It is my responsibility...

128
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:54,983
...and I will not leave
without my people.

129
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,760
All right, give me a minute.

130
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,499
- A minute?
- That's right.

131
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:11,528
Sixty seconds. I suggest you use
that time to go find the priest.

132
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,476
Get Command on the horn.

133
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,039
Eagle One to Command.

134
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:23,012
- Lena, what's going on?
- I don't know yet.

135
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:25,083
Eagle One to Command.

136
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:30,855
Eagle One.

137
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,555
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.

138
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:34,785
No, we got her.

139
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:38,695
But she wants to bring the 70 people
here along with her.

140
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,792
Yes, sir, I understand.

141
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:43,559
I will handle it.

142
00:12:43,904 --> 00:12:45,201
Eagle One, out.

143
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,710
Dr. Kendricks.

144
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:06,820
You win. Get your people together.
We leave in a half an hour.

145
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,155
There will be helicopters for them too?

146
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,723
Yes. We can only take those who can
move under their own power.

147
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,395
I understand.

148
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,328
Thank you, lieutenant.

149
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:19,265
Hurry, please.

150
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:30,583
Why don't we just get Doc
to tranq her the fuck out?

151
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,346
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging
and kidnapping an American doctor.

152
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,546
I ain't sure this bitch is American.

153
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:40,584
The doctor is the mission, Red.
Stick with her.

154
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:45,195
- And we're taking all these people out?
- Go on.

155
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,496
We need everyone able
to travel ready to go.

156
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:53,162
We must leave quickly.
Quickly!

157
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,399
God will bless you, Lena.

158
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,341
- What did the captain say?
- What the fuck you think he said?

159
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:16,023
Okay, let's clear these hooches.

160
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,397
Come here, you guys.

161
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:35,406
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

162
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:40,673
Hour and a half off the rendezvous
with the bird.

163
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:45,017
- Can only bring what they carry by back.
- Roger that.

164
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:49,519
- Where's that priest?
- He says he ain't coming.

165
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:55,461
Bless you, Lena.

166
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,294
Thank you for everything.

167
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,433
Don't cry, Sister, please.
We'll see each other again.

168
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,193
Take care of yourself.

169
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,838
- You got it, Lake?
- Hundred percent, sir.

170
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:14,171
All right. Let's go.

171
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:16,542
Take us out of here,
but don't run away from us.

172
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,378
Roger that.

173
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:25,023
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.

174
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,318
Come on.

175
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,991
Keep them moving, Slo.
Get her out of there.

176
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,133
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on, let's go.

177
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,563
- Come on, now.
- Catch up!

178
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,470
Sister Grace.

179
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,232
- The mother?
- She is dead.

180
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,131
Oh, no.

181
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,204
Oh, no.

182
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:46,675
What am I going to do
with this child?

183
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,041
Lena.

184
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,447
Lena, you'll have to take this child.
It's the only chance she has.

185
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:55,679
We gotta move quicker than this.

186
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,958
We gotta get back for the Falcon game.
Come on.

187
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:03,193
Take care of yourself, girl.

188
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,368
Sister Siobhan.

189
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,938
Mind yourself.

190
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:25,713
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.
Let's go now.

191
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:27,444
I'm not going.

192
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,045
Sister!

193
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,486
- L.T., she doesn't want to leave.
- I'm not going.

194
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:32,886
What?

195
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:38,987
Good luck.

196
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,767
- God bless you.
- Thanks be to God.

197
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,565
All right, let's make it quick.

198
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:47,536
Come on, ma'am, let's go.

199
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,310
Come on. We have plenty of work
to do now. Come on.

200
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,644
Take care.

201
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:04,713
Go with God.

202
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,460
- God already left Africa.
- Yeah.

203
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:28,403
Go easy, doc. Watch your step.

204
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,538
I got her.

205
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:50,028
We're only five klicks in. It's seven
and a half miles to LZ Alpha.

206
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,495
We go any slower, we'll start going
backwards in time.

207
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,568
- Red, what do you got back there?
- Five stragglers.

208
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,537
- 30 meters and falling from main body.
- All right, roll them up ASAP.

209
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:02,869
Let's go.

210
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:06,338
Come on. You've gotta speed up.

211
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:09,744
Ma'am, speed up.
You too. You...

212
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,242
Watch those trees.

213
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,455
I'm gonna help you.

214
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,400
It's all right. I'll tell them.

215
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,443
We got you.

216
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:15,974
Lieutenant.

217
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,578
We need to stop.

218
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,220
- Lieutenant!
- I heard you.

219
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:26,993
We can't stop.
Behind schedule. Come on.

220
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,485
These people need to rest.

221
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,961
And we have a child
who needs medication.

222
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,727
Here we go.

223
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:38,464
There you go, ma'am.
Let's go.

224
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,803
Let's go, doctor.

225
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,839
Come on, sir. Here we go.

226
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:54,253
What you want to do?

227
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:58,188
Rest for 30.

228
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,848
Lake, hold it up.

229
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,155
We're gonna rest for 30.

230
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,956
Set a perimeter.

231
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,088
Perimeter up.

232
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,295
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.

233
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:41,787
L.T., we got guerrilla rebels inbound...

234
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,762
<i>... on our path.</i>

235
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:47,563
Dr. Kendricks, come with me
right away. Come here.

236
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:52,669
There's danger on the trail. You must do
everything you can to... Listen to me!

237
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,172
You must do everything you can to keep
that baby quiet, you understand me?

238
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:58,709
Whatever it takes. Go now.

239
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:09,682
Get up. Get up.

240
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:13,150
Danger close.

241
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,867
Go.

242
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,680
Clear.

243
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,728
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.
Danger close.

244
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,031
Go on, ma'am. Go.
Now is good. Go!

245
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:53,640
Lake, lead us out before they
realize their tailgunner's gone.

246
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:56,747
<i>And find us a safe place to rest.</i>

247
00:27:57,584 --> 00:28:00,576
Wait! They're going to the mission.
You have to stop them.

248
00:28:00,753 --> 00:28:04,484
I can't do that. It'd risk the safety
of all these people here.

249
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:08,618
- Besides, they may bypass the mission.
- You know they won't.

250
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:12,795
There are a lot of possible scenarios
that could happen, Dr. Kendricks.

251
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:15,662
I don't presume
to know them all. Red?

252
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,726
Dr. Kendricks.

253
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,666
- Let's go.
- Ma'am.

254
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:21,201
Come on.

255
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,160
Can't you sleep, lieutenant?

256
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,359
It's my watch, ma'am.

257
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:26,372
You can call me Lena.

258
00:29:29,275 --> 00:29:31,675
Dr. Kendricks, I suggest
you get some rest.

259
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:35,575
You know...

260
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:45,085
Thank you for saving my life.

261
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,956
It wasn't about saving your life.

262
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,231
It's about getting the job done.

263
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:59,738
Completing the mission, that's all.

264
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:18,080
My dear...

265
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:23,519
...a thousand difficulties
don't make a doubt.

266
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:28,961
- But I'm not a good Catholic.
- You don't know that. Only God knows.

267
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:33,771
Gentlemen.

268
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:35,769
Please.

269
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,442
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here.

270
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:41,773
There are only sick people here.

271
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:44,814
Please, sir.

272
00:30:45,618 --> 00:30:48,086
- Gentlemen, please.
- No! No!

273
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:50,050
No! Please! Please!

274
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,349
- No!
- No!

275
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:56,756
Commander, please.
This is a house of God.

276
00:30:57,096 --> 00:31:01,362
We have no soldiers here. We have
hope. We have only sick people here.

277
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:03,525
We have only sick people here.

278
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:04,965
Please.

279
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:10,131
No, commander.

280
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,073
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

281
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,111
Holy Mary, mother of God...

282
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:19,078
...pray for us sinners
now at the hour of our death.

283
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,412
Commander, no!

284
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,451
- Blessed...
- No!

285
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,918
Holy Mary, mother of God...

286
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,407
What the fuck was that?

287
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,635
Hyena.

288
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,776
Flea, Lake, status?

289
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,850
Clear.

290
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:56,877
Clear, L.T.

291
00:31:57,757 --> 00:31:59,281
Zee?

292
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:03,385
Star One, this is Eagle One.
Be advised on location.

293
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:08,161
<i>This is Star One. My E TA,</i>
<i>your location, five minutes.</i>

294
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,961
Popping smoke.

295
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,319
Do you have smoke?

296
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,559
<i>Roger. Yellow smoke.</i>

297
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,397
That's us.

298
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,133
Eyes on.

299
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:27,134
Slo, bring her up.

300
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:30,407
- Let's go! Come on! Now!
- Let's go, ma'am. Come on.

301
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:33,484
Let's go now! Come on! You're first!
Let's go!

302
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:35,243
Goddamn it, let's go! We're late.

303
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,614
Come on!

304
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:51,228
Why doesn't the other helicopter
come down?!

305
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,895
It's a gunship!
It's here to protect us!

306
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:57,735
- What about the others?
- They'll be fine! Keep moving! Hurry up!

307
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,375
You gotta move faster!

308
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,445
- What are you doing?!
- Keep your head down!

309
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:02,672
Stand back.

310
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:04,475
- Where is she going?
- Wait! Back!

311
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,716
Keep your head down!

312
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,048
- Let us go!
- Dr. Lena!

313
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,588
- Wait! Get back!
- Dr. Lena!

314
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:16,751
Answer me! You never planned
on taking all of us out, did you?

315
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,263
I simply follow orders! My orders are
to get you out! Get on the helicopter!

316
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,959
- What about my people?!
- I'm not here for them.

317
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:25,262
You lied to me!

318
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,236
You lied to me!

319
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,307
Liar! Bastard!

320
00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:33,868
Lena! Let me go!

321
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:36,776
What about my people?!
I won't leave them!

322
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,778
You lied to me!

323
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:41,912
- They're gonna die!
- Secure the doctor.

324
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,783
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!

325
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,056
Who decides for me?! You?!

326
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:51,390
Your government?!

327
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:54,632
Bastard! I won't leave them!

328
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,200
Let's go! Let's go now!
Let's go!

329
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:06,635
Let's go! Go! Let's go!

330
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:10,009
Lena! Lena!

331
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:11,238
Listen to me!

332
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,781
Listen to me! It's okay.

333
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,420
Let's go!

334
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,874
<i>Lt. Waters. Starboard side.</i>

335
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:56,280
<i>We saw this on the way in.</i>

336
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:09,864
No!

337
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:11,730
No!

338
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:14,699
No!

339
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,345
- Doc!
- No!

340
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:30,546
Come on.

341
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:41,089
Let's turn it around.

342
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:37,377
Musa.

343
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,342
Patience!

344
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:48,557
Lena!

345
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,534
We can only take 12 people.

346
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,871
Old, young, anybody
who'll slow us down.

347
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,710
We'll meet up again in Cameroon.

348
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:15,482
Go. And tell the others.

349
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,725
- God will bless you.
- Hurry, please.

350
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,736
Thank you.

351
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,749
Hurry, please.

352
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,158
Red!

353
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:01,922
Go with the package.

354
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:03,693
Now, goddamn it!

355
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,744
What are you doing?

356
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,378
New mission?

357
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:21,447
No.

358
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:22,879
Same mission.

359
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,084
Get them ready, Zee.

360
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:39,864
God will protect you.
Take Mama's cross. Take Mama's cross.

361
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,700
Let's go! Get her ready.

362
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,638
We gotta go. We gotta go.

363
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,040
Let's go! Let's go. Come on!

364
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:50,911
Get her out of there!
Get off!

365
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:53,551
- Patience! She'll be safe.
- She's my baby!

366
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,743
Keep your head down.

367
00:41:58,457 --> 00:42:00,550
She has no one to care for her.

368
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,494
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!

369
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,893
Hold her tight!

370
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,094
- Keep your heads down!
- No more packs, sir. We're maxed out.

371
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:13,998
See you in Cameroon.

372
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,866
Come on. Let's go.

373
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:17,765
Here we go. Stay low.

374
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,177
Head down.

375
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:23,375
Let's go.

376
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:25,210
Sergeant! Let's go!

377
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,724
Eagle One, over.

378
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,489
Can you wait one, sir?

379
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,462
A.K.

380
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,993
Command.

381
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:16,356
Yes, sir?

382
00:43:16,535 --> 00:43:20,972
Lieutenant, why is that bird full of
refugees and not your criticals?

383
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,040
The doctor wouldn't leave her people.

384
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,234
You can't get a woman on a helo?

385
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,570
She was on the bird.

386
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:29,837
- <i>It's difficult to explain, sir.</i>
- Oh, come on.

387
00:43:30,015 --> 00:43:33,678
We're marching them to LZ Bravo.
Request helicopters to take them out.

388
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:35,547
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.

389
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:38,986
Come on, give me three choppers. I'll
have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.

390
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,352
<i>Negative!</i>

391
00:43:40,526 --> 00:43:43,256
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've
stopped entering Nigerian airspace.

392
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:46,420
<i>We'll give you what help we can</i>
<i>from our end, but right now...</i>

393
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:47,860
...you are on your own.

394
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,700
Man, I hope you know
what you're doing.

395
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:54,965
Me too, sir.

396
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,143
All right. We'll keep you advised
if the situation changes.

397
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:02,413
Negative on the evac.

398
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,883
Come on. There you go. Come on.

399
00:44:09,054 --> 00:44:10,954
Hang on to the knot, doctor.

400
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:12,514
- Come on.
- We got you.

401
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,556
Come on. Come on, doc.

402
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,652
Americans.

403
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:53,591
Some went in the helicopter.

404
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,828
Some went up the mountain...

405
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,832
...to Cameroon.

406
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:08,098
Slo.

407
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,406
Give me your chow, man.

408
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:23,679
I don't like roast beef anyway.

409
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:37,693
We're a little over 30 klicks
to the path to Cameroon.

410
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:39,029
Roger that.

411
00:46:49,448 --> 00:46:50,540
What do you got?

412
00:46:51,383 --> 00:46:55,877
We got a large body 10 klicks back,
bearing 3-6-0 and closing.

413
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:57,449
How strong?

414
00:46:57,622 --> 00:47:00,557
Thirty, maybe platoon strength,
maybe more.

415
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:02,320
Rebels?

416
00:47:03,395 --> 00:47:04,657
Could be.

417
00:47:05,297 --> 00:47:07,629
Why would anybody be following us?

418
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:09,895
I don't know.

419
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:13,765
But we're gonna find out.

420
00:47:14,906 --> 00:47:16,066
Good job.

421
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:18,502
- Keep an eye on them.
- Roger that.

422
00:47:20,178 --> 00:47:21,839
- Sir?
- We got a problem.

423
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:24,504
We got possible hostiles on our 6.

424
00:47:24,683 --> 00:47:26,514
Get them up, get them ready to move.

425
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:28,152
Roger that.

426
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,150
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me,
please?

427
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:36,760
Thank you. It'll just take a second.

428
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:44,895
- Do you know why anybody'd follow us?
- No, I don't.

429
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:46,365
You sure?

430
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,203
Yes, I'm sure.

431
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:02,019
- Think hard.
- I told you, I don't know.

432
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,188
Get your people ready to go now.

433
00:48:05,457 --> 00:48:08,324
These people have been going
for over 30 hours.

434
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,325
Come on.

435
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:14,860
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.

436
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:23,027
How you doing?

437
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:26,427
The fuck you mean, how am I doing?

438
00:49:26,605 --> 00:49:28,402
You know what I'm talking about.

439
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,777
You know as well as I do...

440
00:49:40,952 --> 00:49:43,887
...that when we left that mission,
those people were dead.

441
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,919
And then we take 28 men, women
and children...

442
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,428
...and we hump for a day.

443
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:53,995
Zee, keep them moving.

444
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:56,325
Be with you in a second.

445
00:49:57,302 --> 00:50:01,363
We get them to the LZ, and we leave
them behind to die like the others.

446
00:50:02,073 --> 00:50:03,631
I'm confused.

447
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:05,571
And the boys are confused.

448
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,243
Get to the point.

449
00:50:07,846 --> 00:50:10,576
Why'd you turn that bird around, L. T?

450
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,549
Talk to me.

451
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,511
I'm with you either way.
You know that.

452
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:22,455
When I figure it out, I'll let you know.

453
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:37,301
This way.

454
00:51:23,088 --> 00:51:25,147
- L.T.
- Go, Lake.

455
00:51:25,423 --> 00:51:28,324
<i>You're gonna want to come</i>
<i>take a look at this.</i>

456
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:37,134
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.

457
00:51:38,003 --> 00:51:41,769
We'll rest here for a minute. Stay down
in these trees. Listen to my men. Go!

458
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,929
Slo.

459
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,206
Stay down. Stay down.

460
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,640
Zee, Flea, with me.

461
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,113
What do you got?

462
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:57,413
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.

463
00:52:10,635 --> 00:52:11,897
How strong?

464
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,968
I counted seven so far, sir.

465
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:16,173
- Flea, get eyes on.
- Roger that.

466
00:52:21,413 --> 00:52:24,109
There could be more in the hooches.

467
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:26,315
Bring them up.

468
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:38,727
Sir, we could go around them
to the north.

469
00:52:50,842 --> 00:52:52,332
L.T.

470
00:52:53,178 --> 00:52:55,237
Rules of engagement.

471
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:57,404
We're already engaged.

472
00:53:01,686 --> 00:53:03,711
Hand me the binoculars.

473
00:53:09,027 --> 00:53:10,289
Flea, you got the Zippo?

474
00:53:11,696 --> 00:53:12,685
Roger that.

475
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:14,956
Zippo first.

476
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:19,860
Red Team, right flank. This way.
Edge of clearing. Wait for my go.

477
00:53:20,205 --> 00:53:23,072
Silent and quick.
Gold Team, on me.

478
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:29,073
Silk, close up that back door.

479
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:32,609
- Flea, keep your eye on the package.
- Roger that.

480
00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:34,274
Holding.

481
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:35,846
Let's go.

482
00:53:44,362 --> 00:53:45,351
On-site.

483
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,441
Goddamn.

484
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,749
Been going at it all day.

485
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,006
- On-site.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

486
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:42,668
Go!

487
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:14,098
It's okay. I'm here to help you.

488
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:18,568
I'll help you. It's okay.

489
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,804
Atkins!

490
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:28,744
Hide!

491
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:49,826
Go! Run! Get out of here!

492
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:51,696
- Doc, get them out of here!
- Move!

493
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,659
Go! Go!

494
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,868
Hold on. You hold on.

495
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:31,871
Come on, little man, come on.

496
00:59:52,663 --> 00:59:55,598
Boss, you want me to take a look
at that?

497
00:59:57,435 --> 00:59:59,130
I'm all right.

498
01:00:35,907 --> 01:00:39,468
It's a kid. It's only a fucking kid.

499
01:00:52,657 --> 01:00:55,683
Motherfucker. Get the fuck up.

500
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:02,363
Look at your work, motherfucker.

501
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:22,184
Lake.

502
01:01:51,215 --> 01:01:53,877
Doc, get over here.

503
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:10,932
Red.

504
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:27,542
Her baby's dead.

505
01:02:40,898 --> 01:02:42,525
Zee.

506
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,983
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

507
01:03:06,257 --> 01:03:09,488
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

508
01:03:11,595 --> 01:03:13,664
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

509
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,029
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

510
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:18,258
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

511
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:30,173
She has a low pulse.

512
01:03:40,224 --> 01:03:42,385
How can they do this?

513
01:03:43,627 --> 01:03:45,686
This is what they do.

514
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:50,191
They cut off the breasts
of nursing mothers...

515
01:03:50,468 --> 01:03:54,131
...so that they'll never again
feed their own babies.

516
01:03:56,807 --> 01:03:59,037
This is what they do.

517
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,312
Doc.

518
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:09,816
I need morphine.

519
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:36,463
Dr. Kendricks.

520
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,198
Dr. Kendricks.

521
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,169
It's all right.

522
01:07:53,043 --> 01:07:56,479
- Is something wrong?
- Let me take care of your arm.

523
01:07:59,216 --> 01:08:00,410
All right.

524
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:17,393
Careful.

525
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:23,353
Try this.

526
01:08:23,563 --> 01:08:25,724
It will help you stay awake.

527
01:08:27,701 --> 01:08:29,362
What is it?

528
01:08:29,536 --> 01:08:31,128
Cola nut from the tree.

529
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:37,176
It's harmless.

530
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:39,312
We've been using them
for generations.

531
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:42,477
Patience, right?

532
01:08:45,118 --> 01:08:46,779
How long you been at the mission?

533
01:08:47,954 --> 01:08:49,353
I live there.

534
01:08:49,523 --> 01:08:52,321
I've been living there since I was 10.

535
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:54,719
How come?

536
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:59,625
I heard they were helping children
who had been forced into the war...

537
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,858
...so I ran to them.

538
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:10,475
Will you get me to my daughter?

539
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:19,484
Yes, ma'am.

540
01:09:29,162 --> 01:09:32,063
How'd you end up here in Africa?

541
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,765
I came here with my husband.

542
01:09:36,503 --> 01:09:38,596
We wanted to help.

543
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:44,038
We went to Sierra Leone.
They were short of doctors there.

544
01:09:44,678 --> 01:09:45,872
Cut.

545
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:56,587
How did your husband die?

546
01:10:03,897 --> 01:10:06,559
We were at the hospital.

547
01:10:08,068 --> 01:10:09,933
The rebels came.

548
01:10:10,937 --> 01:10:15,465
My husband tried to stop them,
to protect me...

549
01:10:16,943 --> 01:10:18,706
...but he couldn't.

550
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:22,571
I'm sorry.

551
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:33,888
You did a good thing today.

552
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:44,994
I don't know if it was a good thing
or not.

553
01:10:50,677 --> 01:10:53,407
Feels like so long since I've done...

554
01:10:54,748 --> 01:10:57,182
...a good thing, the right thing.

555
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:02,551
You should have some rest.

556
01:11:04,825 --> 01:11:07,794
Thank you for taking care of my arm.

557
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:48,291
Easy, boss.

558
01:12:00,213 --> 01:12:03,580
- Are we there yet?
- Glad to see you still got it...

559
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:05,474
...but we got trouble.

560
01:12:11,057 --> 01:12:12,319
You all right?

561
01:12:15,161 --> 01:12:16,185
What do you got?

562
01:12:16,396 --> 01:12:19,160
This is the outfit
that's been on our tail.

563
01:12:19,666 --> 01:12:22,533
- Hey. You with me, boss?
- Yeah.

564
01:12:23,703 --> 01:12:26,399
- This is at 2200 hours.
- Yeah.

565
01:12:27,007 --> 01:12:28,838
Four hours ago.

566
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:30,542
Three hours.

567
01:12:30,777 --> 01:12:34,338
We figured they'd make camp
and come at us after first light, right?

568
01:12:34,514 --> 01:12:35,913
Bad call.

569
01:12:36,182 --> 01:12:37,911
Two hours ago.

570
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:39,173
One.

571
01:12:39,386 --> 01:12:44,187
These guys run the damned Olympics.
They've been closing in on us all night.

572
01:12:44,858 --> 01:12:46,689
How long we got?

573
01:12:47,694 --> 01:12:50,026
An hour, two tops.

574
01:12:50,497 --> 01:12:51,930
We shouldn't have stopped.

575
01:12:52,866 --> 01:12:55,266
How the fuck are they tracking us
at night?

576
01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:04,106
Someone's transmitting something.

577
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,340
Zee.

578
01:13:14,087 --> 01:13:16,578
We got a rat in the nest.
Get them up.

579
01:13:16,756 --> 01:13:19,884
Take their weapons away.
We search everybody right now.

580
01:13:20,393 --> 01:13:21,917
- Okay, team.
- Dr. Kendricks.

581
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:23,756
- Turn two.
- Lena. Get up.

582
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,227
Everybody, up.

583
01:13:25,398 --> 01:13:28,697
Point out everybody that came into
the mission in the last three days.

584
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:30,392
- Right now.
- Let's see the weapons.

585
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:34,698
Give me your weapons.

586
01:13:39,145 --> 01:13:42,137
- Gideon.
- Let's go. Step forward, sir.

587
01:13:42,315 --> 01:13:43,782
Who else?

588
01:13:46,152 --> 01:13:47,619
Who else?!

589
01:13:47,921 --> 01:13:49,081
These people.

590
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:52,383
- Step forward, you two, right now.
- On your knees.

591
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:54,117
L. T!

592
01:13:57,063 --> 01:13:58,394
Down! Now!

593
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:00,326
Silk.

594
01:14:01,668 --> 01:14:03,431
No!

595
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:09,665
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?
- He's my friend!

596
01:14:09,843 --> 01:14:11,743
You know what?
He could also be armed.

597
01:14:11,911 --> 01:14:14,539
Get back there with the others!
Go on!

598
01:14:19,853 --> 01:14:22,378
- Watch his hands.
- Fuck.

599
01:14:24,157 --> 01:14:25,419
Shit.

600
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:29,120
What the hell is that?

601
01:14:29,863 --> 01:14:31,558
What do you got?

602
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:33,360
He's bugged.

603
01:14:33,533 --> 01:14:35,023
You fuck!

604
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,603
- Stop it!
- Who told you to do this?

605
01:14:42,776 --> 01:14:45,108
- They have my family.
- Who told you to do it?!

606
01:14:45,278 --> 01:14:47,769
- They have my family.
- Who has your family?!

607
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:50,780
I was promised no harm
will come to them.

608
01:14:51,985 --> 01:14:54,010
- Who told you to do it?!
- Stop it!

609
01:14:54,687 --> 01:14:57,815
- Who told you to do it?!
- Col. Sadick.

610
01:14:58,558 --> 01:14:59,616
Col. Sadick.

611
01:15:01,127 --> 01:15:03,789
I am one of many
who give him information.

612
01:15:05,331 --> 01:15:07,390
About who?
Information about who?!

613
01:15:07,567 --> 01:15:09,467
We have to follow...

614
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,633
Who?! Who?!

615
01:15:12,806 --> 01:15:15,138
We have to follow...

616
01:15:15,642 --> 01:15:17,906
- Follow who?!
- Arthur.

617
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:19,568
Arthur?

618
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:29,418
I am not a killer.

619
01:15:32,759 --> 01:15:34,488
The fuck you're not.

620
01:15:39,866 --> 01:15:42,858
- What do you wanna do with him?
- Let him bleed out.

621
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:48,869
Why?

622
01:15:51,377 --> 01:15:56,280
What is going to happen
to my family?

623
01:15:58,351 --> 01:15:59,716
I don't know.

624
01:16:00,353 --> 01:16:03,117
- Help them.
- Zee. Lake.

625
01:16:03,523 --> 01:16:05,889
- Get them up.
- Everybody up. Now.

626
01:16:15,301 --> 01:16:17,496
Who knows what this is?

627
01:16:23,476 --> 01:16:25,239
This is a transmitter.

628
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,543
I took this off Gideon's dead body...

629
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:33,045
...Dr. Kendricks' good friend.

630
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,858
You have any more of these here?

631
01:16:41,394 --> 01:16:44,158
Why would anybody wanna transmit
our position?

632
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:48,926
Transmit our position
to over 300 Nigerian soldiers...

633
01:16:49,502 --> 01:16:50,833
...who ran all night...

634
01:16:51,738 --> 01:16:54,730
...to get to within an hour and a half
of where we are now?

635
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,404
Red.

636
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:08,886
Somebody's gonna tell me.

637
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:11,683
Somebody's gonna start talking
right now.

638
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:16,295
Because if they don't tell me
what I want to know...

639
01:17:16,462 --> 01:17:18,692
...by the time I count to five...

640
01:17:18,865 --> 01:17:21,129
...l'm gonna kill someone else.

641
01:17:22,035 --> 01:17:23,525
One.

642
01:17:25,705 --> 01:17:27,366
Two.

643
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:31,407
Three.

644
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:34,737
Don't fuck with me.

645
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:37,376
- Four.
- Please.

646
01:17:38,117 --> 01:17:39,550
Please.

647
01:17:39,786 --> 01:17:41,310
There's no need for this.

648
01:17:43,723 --> 01:17:45,281
Please.

649
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:48,154
Now you got something
to say to me, don't you?

650
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:50,789
My name is Arthur Azuka.

651
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:57,228
I'm the only son
of President Samuel Azuka.

652
01:18:00,873 --> 01:18:02,738
Please don't blame them.

653
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:04,801
Please.

654
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:08,312
I'm sorry to have misled you...

655
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:11,245
...but there are enemies
looking for me everywhere.

656
01:18:11,484 --> 01:18:14,214
That is why you're being pursued.

657
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:20,349
Our report said the entire
presidential family was executed.

658
01:18:20,727 --> 01:18:23,423
Your reports were incorrect.

659
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:26,489
They were not executed.

660
01:18:27,033 --> 01:18:29,160
They murdered my father...

661
01:18:29,769 --> 01:18:31,828
...along with my mother...

662
01:18:32,772 --> 01:18:34,262
...and my two...

663
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,265
...younger sisters...

664
01:18:38,945 --> 01:18:41,038
...out of greed...

665
01:18:41,781 --> 01:18:45,308
...and my father's fight for democracy
for his people.

666
01:18:48,855 --> 01:18:50,447
My people.

667
01:18:52,025 --> 01:18:54,619
When it first appeared
there might be trouble...

668
01:18:54,794 --> 01:18:57,354
...my father sent me away with this man.

669
01:18:58,798 --> 01:19:00,356
Col. Okeze.

670
01:19:02,302 --> 01:19:05,965
Lieutenant, his father was more
than the president.

671
01:19:06,139 --> 01:19:07,800
He was the tribal king.

672
01:19:07,974 --> 01:19:10,169
That makes him the heir
to the lbo nation.

673
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:12,778
It's a bloodline they must cut.

674
01:19:13,246 --> 01:19:16,909
The Fulanis will comb heaven
and earth to find him.

675
01:19:25,058 --> 01:19:26,548
You knew about this?

676
01:19:28,494 --> 01:19:31,054
You knew all the time,
and you didn't tell me.

677
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,897
I didn't trust you...

678
01:19:36,169 --> 01:19:37,864
...at the time.

679
01:19:46,045 --> 01:19:48,206
I wonder what it takes
to earn your trust.

680
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:52,978
Red, Lake.

681
01:19:58,324 --> 01:20:01,054
Tell them to pack their things.
We're leaving.

682
01:20:02,595 --> 01:20:05,564
Men, give them their weapons.
We're moving out of here.

683
01:20:05,732 --> 01:20:07,290
- Pack up your things.
- Come on.

684
01:20:07,467 --> 01:20:08,661
Move it out!

685
01:20:09,469 --> 01:20:11,664
- Get in, get out. Okay?
- Come on.

686
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,970
Move it. Move it.

687
01:20:14,407 --> 01:20:17,342
- Come on. See you. Hurry back.
- Back in formation.

688
01:20:47,373 --> 01:20:51,332
They must continue their route to
the Tandjile Pass or they'll lose a day.

689
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:55,811
So they must come out here,
near the Cameroon border.

690
01:20:59,152 --> 01:21:00,312
No!

691
01:21:30,716 --> 01:21:32,581
How many men
do you have in Gashanka?

692
01:21:40,026 --> 01:21:41,550
Right on time.

693
01:21:41,828 --> 01:21:44,490
Good hustle, Red.
Come on up and brief Zee.

694
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:50,001
This river will get us
straight into Cameroon.

695
01:21:50,403 --> 01:21:52,098
They'll be expecting us.

696
01:21:53,673 --> 01:21:55,368
What do you think?

697
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,839
I think we're fucked
either way we go.

698
01:21:59,345 --> 01:22:02,439
We backtrack, cross downstream...

699
01:22:02,615 --> 01:22:06,051
...come up, go through the jungle
and rip right into Cameroon.

700
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,011
Roger that. Let the other men know.

701
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:12,020
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.

702
01:22:12,925 --> 01:22:14,256
L.T.

703
01:22:14,861 --> 01:22:17,523
- What do you got?
- Rhodes on the phone.

704
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,690
Yes, sir, captain, this is Waters.

705
01:22:22,869 --> 01:22:25,235
Intel reports military elements
in your sector...

706
01:22:25,438 --> 01:22:28,464
...conducting search and destroy
of a U.S. Military unit...

707
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:32,742
...moving with Arthur Azuka, son of the
late president. What can you tell me?

708
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:35,244
Yes, sir, we just discovered that
ourselves.

709
01:22:35,448 --> 01:22:38,781
He and his bodyguard hid themselves
within Dr. Kendricks' refugee party.

710
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:42,050
That's a major problem, lieutenant.

711
01:22:42,221 --> 01:22:46,055
<i>He involves your mission in the</i>
<i>internal politics of a foreign nation...</i>

712
01:22:46,225 --> 01:22:50,218
...affecting U.S. Diplomacy and
seriously increases the mission's risk.

713
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:53,057
He's considered a criminal
by the new regime.

714
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:54,893
He's a major liability.

715
01:22:55,067 --> 01:22:58,559
- What exactly does that mean, sir?
- His party is excess cargo.

716
01:22:58,971 --> 01:23:00,632
You mean he's not human, sir?

717
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:04,869
Captain, this man is the lbo tribal
leader. Do you know what that means?

718
01:23:05,044 --> 01:23:07,171
Cut the shit. Who do you think I am?

719
01:23:09,315 --> 01:23:12,546
Sir, we both know what'll happen to him
if I leave him out here.

720
01:23:12,752 --> 01:23:15,016
<i>There won't be a trial or a jury.</i>

721
01:23:15,187 --> 01:23:17,655
Outside the courthouse,
they'll put two in his head.

722
01:23:18,024 --> 01:23:21,551
I'm just asking for a little help here.
Put yourself in my shoes, Bill.

723
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:23,388
I've been in your shoes, lieutenant.

724
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:26,657
Send in an air evac immediately
and get all of us out of here, sir.

725
01:23:26,832 --> 01:23:30,268
Negative on air support at this time.
Airspace is too hot.

726
01:23:30,436 --> 01:23:34,873
<i>Your judgment has risked the lives of</i>
<i>your men and the mission's success.</i>

727
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:38,340
I advise you, complete the evacuation
as planned! Do you read me?!

728
01:23:39,812 --> 01:23:42,007
Yes, sir, I read you. Loud and clear.

729
01:23:42,815 --> 01:23:46,512
But I cannot, in good conscience, do that
without taking these people to safety.

730
01:23:46,686 --> 01:23:47,744
That's not your mission!

731
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,184
When have I not completed a mission?

732
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:53,785
My team will complete this mission.

733
01:23:54,093 --> 01:23:55,560
I give you my word on that.

734
01:23:55,728 --> 01:23:57,423
I don't like this.

735
01:23:58,097 --> 01:24:00,361
Get your ass back here alive
soon as possible.

736
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:02,592
<i>Maintain contact with OP center.</i>

737
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:07,201
I'll direct air support
as soon as I can.

738
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,837
<i>I promise you.</i>

739
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:10,769
Yes, sir.

740
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:13,109
Eagle One, out.

741
01:24:15,948 --> 01:24:17,279
Bring them up.

742
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,612
Everybody up on L.T. Now. Double time.

743
01:24:20,886 --> 01:24:22,410
So much for diplomacy.

744
01:24:23,556 --> 01:24:24,921
Come on, let's go.

745
01:24:29,962 --> 01:24:33,898
Here's the deal. It's been strongly
suggested that we turn over Arthur...

746
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:37,731
...and abandon these refugees
out here in the bush.

747
01:24:39,905 --> 01:24:42,965
I'll tell you right now
I'm not gonna do that.

748
01:24:43,509 --> 01:24:45,272
I can't do that.

749
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,177
I broke my own rule.

750
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:52,710
I started to give a fuck...

751
01:24:53,586 --> 01:24:56,214
...and brought you guys along with me.

752
01:24:57,423 --> 01:25:02,884
We're about to walk into some serious
shit. Before we do, I'd just like...

753
01:25:05,364 --> 01:25:09,494
...to hear what you guys have to say
about it. That's all. Speak freely.

754
01:25:10,603 --> 01:25:12,730
In my opinion, sir...

755
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:16,136
...we cut our losses.
This isn't our fucking war.

756
01:25:17,543 --> 01:25:19,704
As far as me being in or out...

757
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:22,407
...you know the answer to that.

758
01:25:25,217 --> 01:25:27,378
Let's get these people to safety.

759
01:25:28,387 --> 01:25:30,252
Let's finish the job.

760
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:35,226
I can't leave them, sir.

761
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:39,591
I'm good to go.

762
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:43,726
What about you, Red?

763
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,368
I can't look at them
like packages anymore.

764
01:25:53,179 --> 01:25:55,670
I'm gonna get them out...

765
01:25:56,215 --> 01:25:58,513
...or I'm going to die trying.

766
01:26:04,657 --> 01:26:06,488
Are we there yet?

767
01:26:12,765 --> 01:26:13,959
Thanks, fellas.

768
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:20,400
Strip those packs down
to rolling gear only.

769
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:24,836
Have the refugees drop anything
that don't go "boom." Let's move.

770
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:29,774
Double time. Let's go. Hustle.

771
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:33,713
L. T...

772
01:26:36,188 --> 01:26:38,986
...those Africans are my people too.

773
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:44,057
For all the years that we were told
to stand down and to stand by...

774
01:26:46,799 --> 01:26:48,426
...you're doing the right thing.

775
01:26:54,106 --> 01:26:55,596
For our sins.

776
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:56,964
Hooyah.

777
01:26:57,643 --> 01:26:58,632
Hooyah.

778
01:27:09,455 --> 01:27:10,649
We gotta go.

779
01:27:11,056 --> 01:27:12,045
Let's go.

780
01:27:12,224 --> 01:27:13,384
Lieutenant.

781
01:27:14,527 --> 01:27:16,586
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Arthur.

782
01:27:17,163 --> 01:27:19,631
I should have trusted you.

783
01:27:22,468 --> 01:27:24,436
It's not your fault.

784
01:27:27,706 --> 01:27:30,834
I would've done the same thing
if I was in your position.

785
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:32,910
I wouldn't have trusted me either.

786
01:27:33,078 --> 01:27:35,569
I'm gonna get your people
to Cameroon.

787
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:40,113
I promise.
Come on. We gotta hurry.

788
01:28:32,204 --> 01:28:35,139
L.T., hold one.

789
01:28:35,374 --> 01:28:37,604
Hold one.

790
01:29:02,902 --> 01:29:04,733
What do you got, Lake?

791
01:29:12,645 --> 01:29:15,944
Everybody down.
Get down! Get down!

792
01:29:21,453 --> 01:29:24,251
Where you at, motherfuckers?

793
01:29:24,423 --> 01:29:26,414
Where you at?

794
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:43,640
Fat fuck.

795
01:29:46,645 --> 01:29:48,806
Look at this motherfucker.

796
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:50,606
Pussy.

797
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:54,349
Clear, L.T. It's just a pig.

798
01:29:54,787 --> 01:29:56,379
I'm crossing over.

799
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,084
Sniper, 11 o'clock.

800
01:30:02,261 --> 01:30:03,819
<i>Sniper, 11 o'clock.</i>

801
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:09,961
- Zee!
- Smoke! Give me smoke!

802
01:30:10,135 --> 01:30:11,329
L. T...

803
01:30:12,004 --> 01:30:13,665
...I got hit. Sniper.

804
01:30:13,839 --> 01:30:14,897
Go!

805
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:25,312
- Look who it is. The fucking cavalry.
- Keep your hand on that.

806
01:30:25,484 --> 01:30:26,815
- Sit him up.
- How's he doing?

807
01:30:27,586 --> 01:30:29,781
He's all right. One in the shoulder.
Clean hit.

808
01:30:29,955 --> 01:30:31,718
Sorry, sir. He caught me sleeping.

809
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:32,982
Don't worry about it.

810
01:30:33,192 --> 01:30:36,320
- Did you get that little son of a bitch?
- We got some of him.

811
01:30:36,595 --> 01:30:38,119
- You see anybody else?
- Sorry.

812
01:30:38,297 --> 01:30:39,696
- I'm better than that, sir.
- Don't worry.

813
01:30:39,865 --> 01:30:41,059
I'm better than that.

814
01:30:41,233 --> 01:30:42,461
- Fuck that.
- Can you walk?

815
01:30:42,634 --> 01:30:43,623
Yes, sir.

816
01:30:45,004 --> 01:30:47,996
Let's go, Doc. Make it tight.
Get me back in this shit.

817
01:30:48,707 --> 01:30:50,197
All right. Ready.

818
01:30:54,113 --> 01:30:55,671
Get down!

819
01:31:43,262 --> 01:31:44,524
Grenade!

820
01:32:23,969 --> 01:32:25,436
Dr. Kendricks!

821
01:32:25,938 --> 01:32:27,633
Lena!

822
01:32:28,273 --> 01:32:29,740
Lena!

823
01:32:37,749 --> 01:32:39,444
Lena, listen. Wake up.

824
01:32:39,651 --> 01:32:42,779
Wake up. Oh, God. Wake up.
Wake up. Do you hear me?

825
01:32:42,988 --> 01:32:44,250
Okeze! Okeze!

826
01:32:44,423 --> 01:32:45,583
Wake up.

827
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:47,258
Okeze.

828
01:32:48,227 --> 01:32:49,785
Lena, listen to me.

829
01:32:49,995 --> 01:32:52,327
We've gotta get out of here now!
You hear me?

830
01:32:52,898 --> 01:32:56,629
Listen, we gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out of here right now.

831
01:32:56,802 --> 01:32:58,793
Slo, Zee, get them ready to go now!

832
01:32:59,438 --> 01:33:00,462
Sit up.

833
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,628
Slo!

834
01:33:03,308 --> 01:33:04,707
Slo!

835
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:09,973
- Oh, fuck! Goddamn it!
- Fuck.

836
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:12,879
I never saw it coming, boss.

837
01:33:13,118 --> 01:33:14,346
Son of a bitch.

838
01:33:17,122 --> 01:33:19,556
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

839
01:33:19,725 --> 01:33:22,193
It's my fault.
It's my fault, all right?

840
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:23,623
Breathe.

841
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:26,825
- You know what to do, right?
- Yeah.

842
01:33:27,032 --> 01:33:28,363
Yeah, I know what to do.

843
01:33:28,634 --> 01:33:31,501
You hear me? I got it, okay?

844
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:33,695
Breathe. Just relax.

845
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:37,531
Breathe.

846
01:33:38,043 --> 01:33:39,032
No!

847
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,469
No.

848
01:33:44,883 --> 01:33:48,148
You'll get them there, right?
It's not for nothing, right? Right?

849
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,413
I'll get them there. Don't worry.
I got it.

850
01:33:50,589 --> 01:33:53,183
I got everything, all right?
Don't worry.

851
01:33:54,826 --> 01:33:57,192
Breathe, Slo. Breathe, breathe.

852
01:33:58,497 --> 01:34:00,795
I guess we're there, huh, boss?

853
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:03,733
Yeah, we're there.

854
01:34:26,124 --> 01:34:28,786
Zee, get these people ready to go.
Do it now.

855
01:34:29,695 --> 01:34:31,162
Silk...

856
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:34,060
...get his weapons and ammunition.

857
01:34:35,867 --> 01:34:37,528
What about the body?

858
01:34:37,869 --> 01:34:39,564
We gotta come back for it.

859
01:34:39,972 --> 01:34:41,462
Goddamn it.

860
01:34:41,873 --> 01:34:43,431
Goddamn it!

861
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:53,442
- No.
- Listen to me, goddamn it! Listen to me!

862
01:34:53,619 --> 01:34:56,520
This man is dead. If you don't
want his death to be meaningless...

863
01:34:56,688 --> 01:34:59,953
...it's time for you to become a man
and get your people into Cameroon!

864
01:35:00,225 --> 01:35:03,160
Now cowboy the fuck up!
You got it?

865
01:35:06,465 --> 01:35:08,160
Do you understand me?

866
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:10,130
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

867
01:35:10,302 --> 01:35:11,462
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

868
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,160
- Stay with this man.
- Yes, sir.

869
01:35:13,338 --> 01:35:14,306
It's your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

870
01:35:14,306 --> 01:35:15,967
It's your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

871
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:20,243
Get down! Stay down!

872
01:35:21,246 --> 01:35:24,044
Open up those toolboxes, boys.
They'll be coming!

873
01:35:24,216 --> 01:35:26,013
Conserve your ammo!

874
01:35:26,251 --> 01:35:27,309
Get down! Get back.

875
01:35:27,653 --> 01:35:29,780
- Red, how many claymores you got?

We're at the border.
The gate's right over there!

01:43:22,694 --> 01:43:24,389
Excuse me, let us through.

938

- How's he doing?
- Got a low pulse.

945
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:49,319

I got beaucoup bad guys between
the tree line and my smoke!

Doc, pop smoke now!

950
01:44:02,567 --> 01:44:05,502
- Where's Silk and Red?
- Silk's dead.

951
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:08,571
I don't think Red made it either.
You stay with me, Zee.

We made it.

969
01:47:36,014 --> 01:47:38,744
I'm sorry about your men.

970
01:47:43,087 --> 01:47:45,112
I will never forget you.

971
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:50,250
