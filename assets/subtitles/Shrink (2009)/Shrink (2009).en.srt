1
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,032
Okay.

2
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,593
Good morning.

3
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,002
Whenever you're ready, Dr. Carter.

4
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,977
Should I just...
Do you just want me to start talking?

5
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,878
Yeah, yeah.
I'll just give you a cue.

6
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,748
Happiness Now, take one.

7
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,549
Happiness.

8
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,590
"Happiness" is a word for a feeling.

9
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,754
Feelings are rarely understood in the moment.

10
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,161
They are quickly forgotten,

11
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,394
and almost always mis-remembered.

12
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,131
And besides,
feelings are totally full of shit.

13
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,908
"Feelings are full of shit"?

14
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,035
I don't have that here, Doc.

15
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,046
But... we'll go again.

16
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,445
Right.

17
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,278
Okay, we're still rolling.

18
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,942
Happiness Now, take two.

19
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,521
Happiness.

20
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,384
"I don't think life is absurd.

21
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,647
"I think we're all here for a huge purpose.

22
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,324
"I think we shrink...

23
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,952
I think we shrink from the immensity
of the purpose we are here for."

24
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,662
Go write that motherfucking
screenplay right now.

25
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,392
Let's go, people.

26
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,339
Jemma.

27
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,669
Did you study?

28
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,334
For what?

29
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,345
Periodic tables?

30
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,903
You didn't study.

31
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,054
Come on, come on.
Walk, everybody.

32
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,532
- Morning, Dr. Carter.
- Morning, Miyu.

33
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,368
- How we looking today?
- Busy.

34
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,240
Your Happiness Now is number seven
on the bestsellers list.

35
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,336
I'm gonna go outside.

36
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,920
One, please.

37
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,929
Shouldn't you be in school?

38
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,791
- Yes, sir.
- Are you listening?

39
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,268
- Yes, I am.
- Plastics.

40
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,106
"PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT"

41
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,755
Yeah.

42
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,694
Hey. It's time.

43
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,135
Let the healing begin.

44
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,312
I can't sleep.

45
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,916
I can't stop washing my hands.

46
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:37,190
I keep thinking somebody's
trying to kill me.

47
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:41,290
I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna get
ball cancer from the cell phone.

48
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,770
Earthquakes, AIDS, air pollution.

49
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,204
I'm worried about everything.

50
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,175
I mean, I saw this thing on television

51
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,007
about the icebergs melting.

52
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,981
I mean, holy shit.
If that is for real, we're fucked.

53
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,847
- Okay, just slow down.
- No, I'm a licensed pilot.

54
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,013
I have a black belt in Tae Kwan Do.

55
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,855
This sort of thing
cannot be happening to me.

56
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,919
Panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors...
these things can happen to anybody.

57
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,625
I did a lot of blow in the early '90s.
Do you think that could have...

58
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,064
No, that wouldn't have
anything to do with it.

59
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,965
- I mean a lot.
- No.

60
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,296
All right.

61
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,640
When I was in school,
they gave me these tests.

62
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,044
Apparently, I'm a genius.

63
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,516
A literal, fuckin' genius.

64
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:36,453
Do you feel pressured
to live up to that kind of label?

65
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,548
No, that's the thing.
It's not a label.

66
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,059
I actually am a fuckin' genius.

67
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,790
I mean, I have this, like,

68
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,492
borderline idiot savant thing,

69
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,502
like, 548 times 297

70
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,232
is 162,765.

71
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,035
I don't even want to know that.

72
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,734
I just do.

73
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,746
I am superstitious
and I am freaked out

74
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,011
because there are germs everywhere.

75
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,416
And there is danger everywhere.

76
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,287
And I don't know how
I'm supposed to feel safe.

77
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,155
Do you know why you feel this way?

78
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,992
Honestly?

79
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,463
That's why I came to you.

80
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,419
- 12, 13...
- Hey, Richie. Hey, O.T.

81
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,360
Jemma, you won't believe this.

82
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,126
My friend Teddy shit his pants
at school today.

83
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,636
14, 15...

84
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,467
- Hey, Uncle Jim.
- The school called.

85
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,939
Is Lucy here?

86
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,566
Got her working a double again.

87
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,736
Richie, what the fuck are you doing?

88
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,711
- I have to do these.
- I can't concentrate in here.

89
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,714
I'm trying to pay some bills, Richie.

90
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,649
- Be quiet!
- I have to do these.

91
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,276
Damn.

92
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,151
- Hey, man.
- Hi.

93
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,690
How you doing?

94
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,688
Well, I could be better.

95
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,697
Well, would a car wash
make you feel any better?

96
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,699
I always love a car wash.

97
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,997
All right.

98
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,004
You've got Don Juan,

99
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,337
Jamaican Red, John Wilkes Booth,
Northern Lights,

100
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,467
Mexican Airlines, Mississippi Blonde,

101
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,171
Kentucky Bluegrass, Wickki Sticks,

102
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,405
Pakistani Black...

103
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,004
What is Pakistani Black?

104
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:20,644
Pakistani Black, if you'll notice...
the seeds are black.

105
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,314
So it's literally... It's quite literal.

106
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,857
- Okay.
- There's Pussy Finger.

107
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,517
It's my personal favorite.

108
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,220
I think I'd like to try
Purple Fuck Dust this week.

109
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,889
You sure?
That's not one of our bestsellers.

110
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,727
- Really?
- It's not. I don't know why.

111
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,323
I definitely want some Pussy Finger.

112
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,527
- Definitely.
- Yes, that's...

113
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,570
Number 175.
Do you want the dub sack?

114
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,334
Yeah, a dub sack of both
of those would be great.

115
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,898
But what is Toasty Brunch?

116
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,002
Hey, this is all weed.

117
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,922
"Interior.

118
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,458
Apartment in Silver Lake.
Night."

119
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:14,166
"Exterior.
The jungles of Vietnam, 1966.

120
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,505
Charlie everywhere.
No way out."

121
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,445
"Exterior. Civil War."

122
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,509
Son of fucking Jesus Christ.

123
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,247
"Exterior. Alcatraz."

124
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,791
"Exterior. Mexico."

125
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,623
"Exterior. A space station
in the not-so-distant future."

126
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,129
No. "Interior.

127
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,655
Hogwarts School for fucking wizards!"

128
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,375
Toughbook.

129
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:59,151
Glorious, glorious Toughbook,
I love you so.

130
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,881
Listen, you fucking asshole,
I don't care what he told you.

131
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,850
I'm the agent, and I'm telling you.

132
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,681
I'm so done with you.

133
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,551
Get the guy who writes
the checks to call me,

134
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,921
you third-string, pussyfoot asshole.

135
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,621
Daisy, I'm in the lobby.

136
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,128
- Okay, I'm here.
- Call The Chateau.

137
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,686
- Make sure Shamus is up for lunch.
- Yes.

138
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,427
- Call the Viceroy, table for two.
- Sure. Done.

139
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,492
And this time, can we get
a table in the corner?

140
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,729
I don't like people behind me.

141
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,998
- Okay.
- It's weird.

142
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,165
- It creeps me out.
- It is weird.

143
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,232
Put that down in general.
Nobody behind me in restaurants.

144
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,301
- Mop, there's a mop in my lobby.
- Okay.

145
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,676
- Nobody shakes my hand.
- Yes.

146
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,307
Nobody behind me in restaurants.

147
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,875
And can I please get someone
to hold the elevator for me?

148
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,181
- Yes.
- Is that too much to ask?

149
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,849
Of course. I'm sorry.

150
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,858
- I'm out of the elevator now.
- Okay, I'm ready for you.

151
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,985
- You see the tracking on Norsemen?
- Norsemen.

152
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,154
Daisy, it is DEFCON 5
in the men's bathroom.

153
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,790
There's no motherfucking
bar of soap in there.

154
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,766
- Bar of soap, okay.
- There's no soap in the soap thingy.

155
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,497
It's just a fucking dish
and a goddamn bar of soap.

156
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,163
I mean, what is this?
A gas station?

157
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,867
- We got to get a soap guy in here.
- I'll do it over lunch.

158
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,500
Yeah, but Dave Levine is using that soap.

159
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,169
Do you know how many pros he's been with?

160
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,179
- Yeah.
- Disgusting.

161
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,646
You know what?
Let's just buy some soap.

162
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,773
- Done.
- Lots of soap.

163
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,512
Liquid, antibacterial, hospital grade.

164
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,918
It's going to be my soap.
Private collection.

165
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,148
That's how we're doing it.

166
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,554
What else you got?
Hit me.

167
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,684
I wore gloves.

168
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,491
Okay. You need to send
Michael Burns and his goomah

169
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,555
a "thank you" note for dinner
last Friday evening.

170
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,725
- Why?
- Because it's good manners.

171
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,237
Listen, I need you to go...
No, get a guy.

172
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,773
Find a guy, like an intern or something.

173
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,709
And I need him to go to this place
and take a shit on that guy's doorstep.

174
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,945
Wow, are you...
Are you serious?

175
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,709
Yeah.

176
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,877
Listen, I know you're knocked up,
but let's show a little hustle on that soap.

177
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,046
And get that guy to shit on that doorstep.

178
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,385
That is mission critical.

179
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,651
Hey, Jack, would you mind

180
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,057
if we switched our appointment
next week to 5:00...

181
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,992
5:00 is when I start drinking usually, but...

182
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,397
All right, then, forget about it.

183
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,559
You think I'm a sex addict?

184
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,569
No, I think you might be an alcoholic.

185
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,366
Now, I'm a functioning alcoholic.

186
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,770
Yeah, we've talked about this, Jack.

187
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,967
That's a very misleading term.

188
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,806
In my day, I balled
a lot of chicks, you know.

189
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,073
The stories are true.

190
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,738
Yeah, I know,
you've been sexually active, yes.

191
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,612
Damn right I was active.

192
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,516
Wow, it was amazing.

193
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,521
Then I got married ten years ago.

194
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,284
Promised to give all that up, you know.

195
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,623
Hung up my spurs.
Put the pony in the paddock.

196
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:59,596
Yeah, you might also put it
that you made a commitment.

197
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,259
Yeah. I did.

198
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,234
No more chasing strange,

199
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,498
no more French wrestling.

200
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,937
Do you love your wife?

201
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,200
God, I love Susan.
She's amazing.

202
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,269
She's fucking incredible.

203
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,075
Make's me harder than Chinese algebra.

204
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,640
I love my wife.
You know, I love Paris.

205
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,686
I just wouldn't want to live there
the rest of my life.

206
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,052
It's a fucking addiction, Doc.

207
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,250
I mean that literally.
I'm addicted to fucking.

208
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,349
I should go to Cock Enders.

209
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,223
- You are not a sex addict.
- Really?

210
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,957
Look, if you are beginning
to have feelings of temptation,

211
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,498
we can find ways for you to cope.

212
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,089
I'm ahead of you on that, Doc, okay?

213
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,364
I think I've found a way to cope
because I got this friend, okay?

214
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,802
We'll call him the Admiral.

215
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,203
He's a world-class cocksman.

216
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,467
When I say "world-class,"

217
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,135
I mean this guy sees more puss
than a litter box.

218
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,508
And, Doc...

219
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,079
I do this thing.

220
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,516
All right.

221
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,247
I call him in the morning

222
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,655
and he tells me what went on
the night before.

223
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,990
Kind of a "coitus discriptus"
kind of thing,

224
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,393
and then I...

225
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,661
you know, butter the corn.

226
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,725
Punch the clown.

227
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,101
A little beef "strokinoff."
You know what I'm saying?

228
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,605
- I got it.
- Yeah.

229
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,731
I mean, that's the disease.

230
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,572
That's the addiction.

231
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,737
That's wrong, right?

232
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,713
Look, Jack.

233
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:31,549
If you find that this strategy
of phoning up your Admiral friend

234
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,023
is helping you to stay faithful to your wife,

235
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,288
then it's not weird.

236
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,229
But you have to start to admit
you are an alcoholic.

237
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,596
- Functional.
- Let's stop it.

238
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,126
No, l...

239
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,264
I want to get back out there
and lock crotch.

240
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,535
You got to help me, Doc.

241
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,710
I'm afraid.

242
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,649
I want to feel like a man again, you know?

243
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,993
Jack, I've known you a long time.

244
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,888
But did you just ask me
to give you permission

245
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,059
to cheat on your wife?

246
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,238
Yeah.

247
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,315
Good to see you again.

248
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,653
How are you doing?

249
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,954
I'm okay.
How are you?

250
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,824
Hey, you look a little worse for wear.

251
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,525
Yeah, well, I haven't been sleeping much.

252
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,260
What's going on?

253
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,826
Let's all sit down

254
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,703
and talk.

255
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,848
Henry, you have had a damn tough year.

256
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,183
We are all here, all of us,

257
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,485
because we care about you.

258
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,288
You have a drug problem.

259
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,885
- I got it, James.
- Excuse me, I'm speaking here.

260
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,591
I was addicted to anger.

261
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,499
And you helped me beat it.
Let us help you beat this.

262
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,505
It's obvious that you have been, Henry,

263
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,666
self-medicating for some time.

264
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:30,730
Okay...

265
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,041
Is this...

266
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,139
Is this an intervention?

267
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,948
It's an opportunity.

268
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,965
In the first place,
you were my wife's doctor, not mine.

269
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,865
And in the second place,
I'm not some fucking drug addict

270
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,061
on Wilshire Boulevard, all right?

271
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,196
I'm a doctor.
And let me...

272
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,763
Diana, did you actually
send me a written invitation

273
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,570
two weeks ago to my own intervention?

274
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,110
- Opportunity.
- You say that one more time,

275
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,237
I'm going to throw
a fucking crab cake in your face.

276
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,476
We've arranged a room at a rehab

277
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,643
just north of Oxnard.

278
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,153
Are you shitting me?

279
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,416
He wants to send me to Oxnard.

280
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,589
Look, let me make it clear to you, okay?

281
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:31,603
My wife died, you fucking assholes.

282
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,262
We love you, son.

283
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,000
And it's a bitch seeing you like this.

284
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,168
Well, then don't look, Dad.

285
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,370
Look, l...

286
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,675
We've...

287
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,579
We've written a letter.

288
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,049
We've all signed it.

289
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,018
All right.

290
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,519
Jeremy will read it.

291
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,921
I don't really want to read it
anymore, actually.

292
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:53,980
Okay.

293
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,662
I'll read it.

294
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,595
"Dear Henry, help..."

295
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,634
My wife killed herself.

296
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,006
She had a car accident.

297
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,947
No, Dad.

298
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,848
That's what I told you.

299
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,953
Jesus Chr...

300
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,363
Whoa.

301
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,134
So, I'm going to go out to my car,

302
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,196
I'm going to take a big hit
from a self-medicating joint,

303
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,299
and then I'm going
to Kentucky Fried Chicken

304
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,641
'cause it's finger-fucking-licking good.

305
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,330
"Cherokee" is from the word "Muscogee."

306
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,438
Cherokee means
"speakers of another language."

307
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,747
Does anybody know
how the Cherokees lived?

308
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,185
What sort of people were they?
Were they warriors?

309
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,382
Where do you think you're going?

310
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,482
Jemma. I need you to go
back to your seat.

311
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,988
Jemma, go back to your seat now.

312
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,387
A fucking intervention?

313
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,192
Who the fuck are they to intervene?

314
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,723
Who the fuck are they to point the finger?

315
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,032
- Do you think I have a problem?
- What kind of problem would you have?

316
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,401
Everyone's got a problem?

317
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,167
With this? With drugs?

318
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,808
No. Why does it always have
to be about the drugs?

319
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,839
Why does everything have to have a label?

320
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,508
Why...

321
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,575
Why's it got to be right or wrong?

322
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,349
Why does it have to be the drugs?

323
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,684
It's grief.

324
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,190
What?

325
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:44,888
They want you to have
some kind of normal response to grief.

326
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,760
So they don't have to watch.

327
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,561
But it's mine.

328
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,066
Yeah.

329
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,831
I know it's yours.

330
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,838
What are you talking about?

331
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,977
Yeah, I'm going to go around the world
making my music.

332
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,377
Rocking cocks, that's what I do.

333
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,938
That's who I am.

334
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,651
I'm sorry?

335
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:12,622
Rockin' cocks... it's a music term
for making people happy.

336
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,090
Are you comfortable?

337
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,491
Well, as much as I can be.

338
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,994
Good.

339
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,624
I think he's become...

340
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,292
a narcissist.

341
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:27,065
Is that what your
Gypsy yoga teacher told you?

342
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,334
No, and she's not a Gypsy.

343
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,966
And I'm not a narcissist.

344
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,504
What's a narcissist?

345
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,640
It's someone who doesn't give a shit
about anyone but themselves.

346
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,857
Fuck it.
I got to take a leak.

347
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,195
He wasn't always like this.

348
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,639
It's like I'm watching everything
from the distance.

349
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,901
Like I'm not really there.

350
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,773
I'm just...

351
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,142
Numb.

352
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,124
Mommy.

353
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,723
Here, come on, baby.

354
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,900
You kind of look like Kate Amberson.

355
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,102
Anybody ever tell you that?

356
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,508
No.

357
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,776
I mean, you could be, like,
her older sister or something.

358
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,817
And I can I get cash back?

359
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,852
Miss Jenkins,

360
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,648
get the superintendent on the phone, please.

361
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,053
Get me permission to search those lockers.

362
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,784
Let's go.

363
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,349
Get to class, young lady.

364
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,590
So, you on drugs?

365
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,130
No.

366
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,462
Look, I know this year has been
kind of hard on you.

367
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,798
Thank you.

368
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,436
Are you going to expel me?

369
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,738
No, I want you to talk to somebody.

370
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,539
No, thanks.

371
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,172
Look...

372
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,241
Jemma, what do you think
your mother would say about all this?

373
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,028
- Hey, is Hector working next week?
- Yeah.

374
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,593
- Trying to pick up some of his shifts.
- Yeah, I'll put in a good word.

375
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,002
Thanks.

376
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,205
Sorry about that, sir.

377
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,245
This is my car.
It's worth more than you.

378
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,883
Patrick Silver, as I live and breathe.

379
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,723
Hey, man, long time no see.

380
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,456
How are you doing, you fucking biotch?

381
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,589
Mitch, don't touch me.
You know better than that.

382
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,258
Congratulations on the divorce.

383
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,858
Yeah, well, look around.

384
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:11,994
I'm back, you know.

385
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,697
- Yeah, well, I never left.
- Right.

386
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,763
Hey, did you see Tokyo Missile Crisis?
What do you think?

387
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,535
I don't know.
What's it going to gross?

388
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,009
Jesus, man, do you even go
in the office anymore?

389
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,568
Bro, this is my office.

390
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,979
You have no idea how much heat
this has brought to my profile.

391
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,176
And you should stay over tonight.

392
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,240
Don't touch me.

393
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,879
Because this house has more poontang
than you could ever fuck.

394
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,150
Yeah, dude, I'm just here to find Shamus.

395
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,589
- I thought he was in the hospital.
- No, he's here.

396
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,854
- He told me to meet him here.
- All right, what was it?

397
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,225
- It's heatstroke.
- Yeah.

398
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,355
Yeah, I snorted
too much heatstroke once myself.

399
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,059
Hey, did you read my asteroid movie?

400
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,395
Shamus would crush that.

401
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,936
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about disaster pictures this year.

402
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,666
It's not a disaster picture.
It's an asteroid movie.

403
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,870
You know, fucking space rocks
ripping through fucking space.

404
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,242
You know, people lined up
nuts to butts to see that.

405
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,372
Yeah, bring an offer with some stink on it,

406
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,973
'cause if you don't get
on the train right now,

407
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,677
- he's going to be 20 against 20.
- I know.

408
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,117
You took me all the way through the house.

409
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,212
- Where the fuck is Shamus?
- I don't know.

410
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,622
I've been on ecstasy all day.

411
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,593
- Do you know where Shamus is?
- Jesus knows.

412
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,495
- Yeah, come on, follow me.
- Come on, let's go.

413
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,592
Mitch is fucking paying $200,000 a month...

414
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,931
How are you doing?

415
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,734
And where's the landscaping at, man?

416
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,104
I mean, where's the weed-eater at?

417
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,904
Where's the pride of ownership?

418
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,842
How long has Shamus been here?

419
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,812
It's hard to say.
Two days maybe.

420
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,044
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

421
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,517
- Is that him?
- Shamus.

422
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,178
Is that Shamus?

423
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,814
- Holy shit.
- Hey, snap out of it.

424
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,155
- Dude, hello.
- Where the fuck have you been?

425
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,922
I fucking called your home, you little prick.

426
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,793
- Come on.
- Wait, don't touch that drum.

427
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,594
Come on.

428
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,134
Fucking hell.

429
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,871
You just got out of the fucking hospital.
What the fuck?

430
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,635
What the fuck?
This is what the fuck.

431
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,939
This isn't what I fucking thought
it was going to be like.

432
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,241
What? Wasted out of your mind
in a drum circle?

433
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,871
Fuck.

434
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,416
Do you know what they're fucking saying
about me on the Net?

435
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,078
- What?
- They're fucking saying I've got a big cock.

436
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,280
That's awesome.

437
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,550
Fuck... I want to be fucking taken seriously.

438
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,888
Well, you're not going to be
fucking taken seriously

439
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,292
if you keep getting hospitalized
for heatstroke.

440
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,456
Listen, you got a fucking
couple of Coke cans hanging.

441
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,330
You're a goddamn tripod.
Embrace that shit.

442
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,427
- I just want to make films, you know.
- I got a film for you.

443
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,404
It's you, and you have a massive cock

444
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,441
on a massive asteroid hurtling toward...

445
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,533
Fucking good films, you know?

446
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,373
It's going to be good.

447
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,914
- Shit.
- We got to get you out of here.

448
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,040
I said don't fucking touch the drum!

449
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,311
Don't touch the drum.
Come on.

450
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,443
Fucking hell.

451
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,316
Shamus, lose the girl.
We're going.

452
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,582
Wait, Patrick!

453
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,283
- I didn't know you came here.
- I don't.

454
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,346
Me neither.

455
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,222
Listen, I got this drum circle script.

456
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,353
It's kind of like Big Wednesday

457
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,862
meets Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

458
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,455
- That sounds amazing.
- It's amazing.

459
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,092
- Send it to my office.
- Yeah, okay.

460
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,033
Hey, sorry.

461
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,129
- You're Patrick Silver, right?
- I am.

462
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,730
I'm a writer.

463
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,206
- Really?
- Yeah.

464
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,140
I have a script I wrote last year.

465
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,769
Comedy or drama?

466
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,074
You know, it's hard to say.

467
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,705
I feel like life isn't really
one or the other.

468
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,250
Right, right, right.
Send it to my office.

469
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,808
- Cool. Thank you.
- Thank you.

470
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:15,875
Bye now.

471
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,479
- You sure this is a cig?
- No.

472
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,651
I had a dream last night.

473
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,361
I was in the ocean on a boat.

474
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,831
I think it was a Coast Guard boat,

475
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,563
and I think I was in a uniform.

476
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,901
And so, we were crashing
through the waves

477
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,033
and there was a storm
and raining and everything...

478
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,676
We were searching for someone.

479
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,374
Someone had to be rescued.

480
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,417
And when we finally found him...

481
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,413
...it was me.

482
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,753
I was the one drowning.

483
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,918
But I was also on the boat.

484
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,826
Maybe I'm suffering
from compassion fatigue syndrome.

485
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,734
And just what the fuck is that?

486
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,739
When you're overwhelmed.

487
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,799
Yeah, it's when you're overwhelmed

488
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,868
by a feeling.

489
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,677
Drowning in a feeling.
Does that...

490
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,550
Look, kid, you can't beat
the shit out of yourself

491
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,614
because she...

492
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,805
Excuse me, Dr. Carter.
Your 2:00 is here.

493
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,104
Thank you. Be right there.

494
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,806
That's all I get?

495
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,851
No, absolutely not.

496
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,082
It is out of the question.

497
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,556
Of course you can.
Read the file.

498
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,390
No, Dad, look.
She's a kid, all right?

499
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,987
She's probably got real problems, real stuff.

500
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,464
Ghetto stuff.
What do I know about that?

501
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,902
I can barely handle the patients
that I already... Dad.

502
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,720
That's a European cigarette.

503
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,461
Just put it down, now.

504
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,469
So people pay you
to tell you their problems?

505
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,201
How much?

506
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,506
Well, normally... Oh, no.

507
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,910
You and I, this... This is pro bono.

508
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,540
- It means that...
- No, I know what it means.

509
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,277
You should bill my school.

510
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,291
You know,
just because they sent you here,

511
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,691
doesn't mean they think
you're crazy or anything.

512
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,320
They just thought
it might be good for you

513
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,489
to have someone to talk to.

514
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,656
Yeah, I know.

515
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,360
I've seen Ordinary People.

516
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,100
So, you want to tell me
what happened to your hand?

517
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,575
It's in the file.

518
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:27,838
I'd rather hear it from you.

519
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,677
I punched out a mirror
in the girls' bathroom.

520
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,344
What happened?

521
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,853
Don't want to talk about it.

522
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,793
My father tells me
you've been skipping classes.

523
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,128
I go to the movies.

524
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,327
You like the movies?

525
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,200
No, I hate movies.

526
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,209
I was just trying to figure out
what's going on in your life...

527
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,609
It's in the file.

528
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,769
I didn't know.

529
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,675
It says that your mother...

530
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,613
I don't want to talk about that.

531
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,023
Look, I know how hard it is,

532
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,752
- but sometimes...
- Fuck this.

533
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,384
...when you lose someone...

534
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,689
Jemma.

535
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:11,477
I thought you weren't supposed
to be my friend anymore.

536
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,882
Yeah, well, I couldn't do it.

537
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,287
Want to go get some dinner or something?

538
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,651
I can't even write two sentences.

539
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,892
I'm broke.
I'm mowing lawns.

540
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,455
Mowing lawns?
Whose lawns?

541
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,559
Just your dad's right now.

542
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,228
You're mowing my dad's lawn?

543
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,464
- Your table's ready.
- Thank you.

544
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,871
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm serious.

545
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,568
You know, I need to start therapy again.

546
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,738
With me?
No, no, no, I can't.

547
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,545
I can't pay you right now,
but we can add it to the tab.

548
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,107
Or I can clean your pool or something.

549
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,245
But you'd have to pay for the chemicals.

550
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,188
No can do. Arigato.

551
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,495
You know, we haven't gone
to dinner since the...

552
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,723
I know.

553
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:09,029
If my mother was her godmother,
what does that make us?

554
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,905
Godbrothers by marriage.

555
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,310
- Does that even exist?
- I don't think so.

556
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,249
Rode my moped to the cemetery last week.

557
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,877
Left her some flowers.

558
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,016
She would've liked that.

559
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,972
Do I know you?

560
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,135
Nope.

561
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,991
You probably don't know this.

562
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,464
She followed you in her car that night

563
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,059
because you insisted on driving
your piece of shit home

564
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,160
even though you were blasted.

565
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,762
She did?

566
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,777
And she said every time
you came to a stoplight,

567
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,040
you toppled over.

568
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,777
She said, like in slow motion,
like an oak tree.

569
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,984
You know, l...
I watched Taxi Driver with her

570
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,549
and there was that scene when he goes
to the movie theater in Time Square.

571
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,390
Remember that?

572
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,794
And I looked over at her then,
and she was...

573
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,499
And she was crying.

574
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,682
The first step towards happiness
is always the hardest.

575
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,981
Who said that?

576
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,386
You did.

577
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,825
I did?

578
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,420
Yeah.

579
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,163
You want to borrow it?

580
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,135
Yeah, maybe.

581
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,034
Maybe I should read it.

582
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,504
I'll just give it a quick read.

583
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,966
Yeah, it's good.

584
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,805
- Hey.
- Hi.

585
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,399
- Who's this?
- This is August.

586
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,671
Come here. Say hi.

587
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,007
I didn't know you came here.

588
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,378
Well, only once a week.

589
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,246
We used to come a lot more often,

590
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,651
but the vet's afraid he's going to have
a heart attack.

591
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,745
Or maybe it's me.

592
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:15,750
It's good to see you.

593
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,316
God, I look awful.

594
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,384
- Oh, no.
- I'm all sweaty.

595
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,692
No, it's... I look terrible.

596
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,966
I'll see you next week.

597
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,436
Evan's not coming anymore.

598
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,140
What? Is he off rockin' cocks?

599
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,042
No, he's just not coming.

600
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,407
- Well, it's good to see you.
- Yeah.

601
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,623
So, I was thinking today maybe we could
just drive around, you know?

602
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,128
Maybe go up to the planetarium
or something.

603
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,097
Fuck, I just feel like
getting out of the hotel.

604
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,497
Or how about going
to the apartment building

605
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,727
where F. Scott Fitzgerald died?

606
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,566
- Who?
- F. Scott Fitzgerald.

607
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,334
- Who's that?
- He's a writer.

608
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,570
Fuck, I'm not saying...
Just get in the car and drive around.

609
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:11,274
I can't.
I have an audition in an hour.

610
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,874
Can you blow it off?

611
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,919
No, 'cause then I have to go to work.

612
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,476
- You have to go to work?
- Yeah.

613
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,579
What do you do?

614
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,353
I work at a temp agency
at a car rental place.

615
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,155
Fuck, that's cool.

616
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,493
Yeah, well, my agent sucks, though.

617
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,762
- Fuck, you should meet Patrick.
- Who's Patrick?

618
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,360
Well, Patrick's my agent.

619
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,836
He's a little crazy, but he's a good guy.

620
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,134
Really? I can meet him?

621
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,371
If you want.

622
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,140
You'd do that?

623
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,478
For you, yeah, I'll do that.

624
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,676
I really like you.

625
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,811
I really like you, too.

626
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,754
So, you're still getting intervened?

627
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,189
I got this patient now.
My father gave me this case.

628
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,658
I know what he's up to.

629
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,719
He's like some little elf,

630
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,789
you know, with some magical plan that...

631
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,960
She's a kid.
I mean, for Christ's sakes.

632
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,902
I can't take on that kind of responsibility.

633
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,496
You know, l...

634
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,474
She needs somebody who can tell her
that everything's going to be great

635
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,976
and the world is beautiful.

636
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,773
And I'm in no shape to do it anyway.

637
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:21,713
And besides, I can't fix people.

638
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,388
I think you can try.

639
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,885
Do you want some Sticky Icky?

640
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,587
- Texas Sticky Icky?
- No, no. Just let me finish this.

641
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,960
This is Uncle Henry.

642
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,902
- Hey, man.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

643
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,528
What? You said 7:30.

644
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,664
It's fucking 5:30, though.

645
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,301
Shit, man, I'm sorry.
I don't have a watch.

646
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,538
- Is this your dad?
- No, it's not my dad.

647
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,807
- That's...
- Henry Carter.

648
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,179
What, like the doctor?

649
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,410
No, I am the doctor.

650
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,578
Fuck off.
You're not the doctor.

651
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,713
- I am. I'm Henry Carter.
- Really?

652
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,552
Yeah, really, Henry Carter.

653
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,252
- I'm fucking listening to your book.
- Christ, you're kidding.

654
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,760
No.

655
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,921
Is it helping?

656
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,426
I don't know.
It's hard to say.

657
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,025
I've just started.

658
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,662
Fuck, is this... this a therapy session
or something?

659
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,230
No.

660
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,208
Are you the girl from the Carl's Jr. Ads?

661
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,342
Yeah, I am.

662
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,545
Who are you?

663
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,417
I'm a writer.

664
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,547
Really?

665
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,181
Anything I would know?

666
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,421
Unfortunately, no.
I haven't...

667
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,861
But that's soon to change.

668
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,329
Jeremy Banks?

669
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,161
Yeah.

670
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,258
- Hi.
- Hi.

671
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,700
You have an appointment with Patrick?

672
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,397
No, I just met him the other day

673
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,531
and he said I should
send my script here, so...

674
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,734
I just...

675
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,403
Do you always drop off
your scripts in person?

676
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,241
No, this is the first time.

677
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,476
It's weird to do that, isn't it?

678
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,610
This is weird, right?

679
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,051
It's a little weird, yeah.

680
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,588
Shit.

681
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:09,752
Patrick doesn't really read scripts,
but I'll give it a read, okay?

682
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,853
- You will?
- Yeah, unless it sucks.

683
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,522
Right.

684
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,829
Congratulations on the pregnancy.

685
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:18,960
Thanks.

686
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,527
Kate Amberson.
We love Kate Amberson.

687
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,539
We have always loved Kate Amberson.

688
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,598
Hit me.

689
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,541
Murder Factory 4.

690
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,409
3. It's Murder Factory 3.
It will be the third one.

691
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,813
Not interested.

692
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,283
I see you want something
with a little more substance.

693
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,445
So playing a paraplegic...

694
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:41,013
Paralyzed from the upper lip down,
but it would convey a message, I think.

695
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,321
What does she look like these days?

696
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,123
- Right.
- I mean she did just have a kid.

697
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,527
She's a mom.
Is she a mom I'd like to fuck?

698
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,963
Adult drama.

699
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,967
- Something with fucking.
- Lesbian.

700
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,026
Not disgusting lesbian,
but tasteful lesbian.

701
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,092
Right, right.

702
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,038
Broken marriage.
Secret affair.

703
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,768
Fucking in the shower sort of thing.

704
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,437
How do you feel about her portraying
a female member of the Taliban?

705
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,071
Film's called Burka.

706
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,446
She'd have to wear a burka,
so how are her eyes?

707
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,814
Are they puffy from having babies?

708
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,853
The Year of the Avalanche script.

709
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,050
Fucking in a cabin
while it's buried under the snow.

710
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,591
- Very hot, nice work.
- Right?

711
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,819
We need a belly double.

712
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,623
This is Kate Amberson.

713
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:22,154
This is Kate mother-fucking Amberson.

714
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,358
Take a deep breath there, champ.

715
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,164
Relax and talk to us.

716
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,330
I want to pick the exact, right phrase

717
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:33,866
to convey the delicacy of what it is
that I'm feeling right now.

718
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,935
Fuck you. Fuck you.

719
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,412
Okay.

720
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,646
I had a few one night and I got this tattoo.

721
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,552
You know, it's in kanji.

722
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,647
I can read kanji.

723
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,817
- Serious?
- Yeah.

724
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,416
Are you reading my files?

725
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,018
Mr. Holden, you know I can't do that.

726
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,860
Maybe you should.
There's some pretty wild stuff in there.

727
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,194
Maybe you and I can make
an appointment.

728
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,359
You know, so you can at least tell me

729
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,800
if this says "Happiness and laughter."

730
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,838
Mr. Holden.

731
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,532
I think I'm wrong.

732
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,007
Are you who I think you are?

733
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,442
Yeah, nice to meet you.

734
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,675
You should make better movies.

735
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,578
I'm glad you came back.

736
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,625
I have to.
They're making me.

737
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,057
Well, they want to help you.

738
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,992
I told you I don't need any help.

739
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,196
So Jack Holden comes here?

740
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,100
I can't talk about my clients.

741
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,968
Any other famous people come here?

742
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,066
I can't talk about my clients.

743
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,132
How was your week?

744
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,374
Did you see any movies?

745
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,973
Apocalypse Now.

746
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,780
Whoa.

747
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:54,016
If Jack Holden comes here
for his problems,

748
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,956
why do you care about someone like me?

749
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,551
What are your problems?

750
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,757
When did I say I had any problems?

751
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,891
I think you just did.

752
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,767
I didn't want to look at myself.

753
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,344
This week?

754
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:22,248
Didn't want to look at myself.

755
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,123
How did it go at the studio?

756
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,660
Great. I mean,
I can make it rain scripts

757
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,095
- by this afternoon, but...
- But what?

758
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:38,032
Well, it's going to be
a little different this time.

759
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:44,338
- What do you mean?
- You're not 27 anymore.

760
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,340
I mean, you're not even 30.

761
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,676
- You're saying I'm old.
- I'm not saying...

762
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,716
- A little bit old. I'm kind of old.
- No, you're not.

763
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,375
- I'm past... Okay.
- I was in there with you...

764
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,919
- Listen, I'm aware of...
- You're not old, you're just not young.

765
00:45:56,987 --> 00:46:01,356
It's going to limit the roles just a little.

766
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,916
- I know.
- Hi, excuse me.

767
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,690
Are you who I think you are?
Could I take a picture with you?

768
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,958
God, no.

769
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,020
- Really?
- No.

770
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,862
- I'm, like, a big...
- I'm sorry.

771
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,061
- This is really not...
- Bitch.

772
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,632
But on the whole it's a fucking...
it's a big movie, it's a good movie.

773
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:23,840
We had a bunch of sword fighting
and horse riding, and...

774
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,972
- They couldn't use guns.
...beautiful ladies.

775
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,539
Not yet. If they had them, boy,
that would've been a quick movie.

776
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,778
Like...

777
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,012
- Everyone's dead.
- Good night.

778
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,611
The battle would've been over in seconds.

779
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,712
That's it.

780
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,417
What a great director, too.

781
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,220
He was a genius.
He was fantastic.

782
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,351
Brilliant man.

783
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,190
If he ever gets English down, watch out.

784
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:42,824
Some of the movie's
got some beautiful girls.

785
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,061
- Beautiful girls, yeah.
- Beautiful fucking girls.

786
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,000
But once they shave,
they're going to be... a little French.

787
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,268
You have to go like,
"Watch out there. Props."

788
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,002
Second hairdresser.

789
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,338
- Yeah.
- Scary.

790
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,312
But, you know, the movie itself
is a fucking great film.

791
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:01,681
It's got Jack,
which makes any movie great.

792
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,344
Fuck, we've done
how many of these today?

793
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,082
- 50.
- Fucking 50, 75.

794
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,090
And what else... what else
can we say about the film?

795
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,183
It's a big, fuck-off action movie

796
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,593
with some great fight scenes,
battle scenes, you know?

797
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,428
It's... Fuck...

798
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,401
- You end.
- What else?

799
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,562
Let's get the fuck out of here.

800
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,833
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.

801
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,238
Good night. Thank you.

802
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,134
Yeah, enjoy the film.

803
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,404
This is not my normal ride, okay?

804
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,948
I don't roll like this all the time.

805
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,280
My wife took my fucking car keys.

806
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,979
She's right, though.

807
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,215
Two-thirds in the tank,
I shouldn't be driving.

808
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,885
Can I ask you a question?

809
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,019
Shoot.

810
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,724
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

811
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,769
Not really a question.

812
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,827
No.

813
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,237
Man, can you take the wheel?

814
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,736
It's pretty...
Hold on, I got to piss.

815
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,802
Just take it.

816
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,951
Fuck me. Fuck me!

817
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,393
You want to get straight?

818
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,262
No, I really... Okay.

819
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,700
Jesus.

820
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,037
Yeah?

821
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,981
Your clients...

822
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,747
Do you ever feel like
you can't do anything for them?

823
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,622
I mean, really, anything?

824
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,953
I don't know.
I just sell smoke.

825
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,432
It's not that...

826
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:00,129
It's not that serious, I don't think.

827
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,573
I got to go to the grocery store.

828
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,170
I'll see you later.

829
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,408
All right.

830
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,348
Drive safe.

831
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,955
Wow.

832
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:30,722
Hey.

833
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,098
Once again we meet.

834
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,366
Nice cart.

835
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:39,597
Just wanted ice cream.

836
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,903
I would love ice cream, too.

837
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,141
Have some.

838
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,810
No, I can't, apparently, 'cause l...

839
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:51,080
I'll get fat or something.

840
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,280
That's fucked up.

841
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,829
I worked in an ice cream shop
in high school in Warren, Ohio.

842
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,125
Did you?

843
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,730
Banana split sundaes.

844
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,669
I make a mean Black and White.

845
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,740
So, Miss Amberson,
did you always want to be

846
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:20,510
Miss Ice Cream of Warren, Ohio?

847
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:25,317
Or did you always want to be
one of Tinseltown's brightest stars?

848
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,516
I pretty much always wanted to act.

849
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,220
I guess dreams do come true.

850
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:35,390
Yeah, but I still ended up
in your office, didn't I?

851
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,229
So, what about you?
Where did you grow up?

852
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,962
Me, I grew up here.

853
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,441
Did you always want to be a therapist?

854
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:51,972
I don't even know anymore.

855
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:55,246
That is ancient history.

856
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,481
You're not that old, you know.

857
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,523
Neither are you.

858
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,490
I am in this town.

859
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,619
Well, like I said, fuck 'em.

860
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,293
Daisy? Daisy?

861
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,997
This fucking asteroid script,
could that really happen?

862
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,972
Yeah, they have the money.

863
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,065
- Hedge fund financing, I think.
- No, no, no.

864
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,167
I mean an asteroid hitting the Earth.

865
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,109
Yeah, I think so.

866
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,445
Any day it could happen?

867
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,950
Or in 100,000 years?
Or what?

868
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,509
I don't know.

869
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,748
Fucking find out, all right?

870
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,348
Do we have a guy at NASA?
Just... Fuck.

871
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,483
We need a guy at NASA.

872
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,551
Are you high?

873
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,357
No, I'm not.

874
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,057
It's walrus tusk.
It's totally medicinal.

875
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,759
I got a guy in Little Antarctica.

876
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,859
Hey, did you check my dome supply?

877
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,928
You make sure all
the expiration dates are right?

878
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,165
No lambskin?

879
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,834
No, you're all set.

880
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,240
All right. All right.

881
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:59,747
I'm going to go back in and gorilla pimp
that girl from the Carl's Jr. Ads.

882
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,148
Sleep tight.

883
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,200
- You're a really good writer.
- Thank you.

884
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:03,645
That's good news because
I am a piece of shit valet.

885
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:04,907
Okay, I have bad news.

886
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,175
What?

887
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,615
They basically made
a bad version of the script,

888
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,710
and it's coming out next summer.

889
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,049
What? Really?

890
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,555
How is that possible?

891
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,215
Mine takes place in an alternate reality.

892
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,125
I know.
Yours is better, but...

893
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,220
I don't know. I think maybe you should
work on something new.

894
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,889
Excuse me.

895
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,227
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

896
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,597
Okay.

897
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,603
You want to get a drink
this weekend or something?

898
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,298
Baby on board.

899
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,738
Right. Shit.

900
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,799
Sorry, I'm an idiot.

901
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,141
Who's the father?

902
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,944
Oh, God.
That's so long.

903
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,711
You know what?
I have to go to this thing.

904
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,013
It's going to really suck,

905
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:46,544
but if you want, you could join me.

906
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,215
- It's not going to be fun.
- Yeah, I'll go.

907
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,191
- You could? Okay.
- Yeah.

908
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,988
I'm glad we're finally meeting.

909
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,395
Shamus is sweet.

910
00:53:55,465 --> 00:54:00,334
So you were in that vampire movie?

911
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,495
Yeah.

912
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,436
- Did you see it?
- I didn't.

913
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:07,408
You were in a couple of other indies

914
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,672
and that American Apparel ad.

915
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,010
And you're, what, 19?

916
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,174
21.

917
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,945
Street legal.

918
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:17,987
I'm just fucking him, by the way.

919
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,055
You're just fucking him?

920
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,021
Yep.

921
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,531
Do you have any idea who I am?

922
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,694
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

923
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,062
You know this information
will probably get back to him, right?

924
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,471
Stop!

925
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,447
Stop right there!

926
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,211
You're dead, Stitch!

927
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,583
You know what your problem is,
Ramirez, you piece of shit?

928
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,815
What's that?

929
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,857
Me.

930
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,950
- The fucking gun's jammed again.
- That's a cut.

931
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,120
- Come on, man!
- God damn it.

932
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,891
Can we get Shamus a real gun?

933
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,049
- Hey, Shamus!
- Right here, Shamus!

934
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,814
Hey!

935
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,007
- Hi.
- Hi.

936
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,572
You made it.

937
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,708
Do you like it?

938
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,116
Yeah, it's cool.

939
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,813
Can I get you a cocktail?

940
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,152
Pregnant.

941
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,419
- What?
- I'm still pregnant.

942
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,518
Right. Sorry.

943
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,597
Look, I want to tell you something.

944
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,000
Okay.

945
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,971
I know we're just getting
to know each other

946
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,405
and we really don't know
where this is going,

947
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:55,376
but I just really feel like
I should tell you this.

948
00:56:57,013 --> 00:57:00,005
- I like you.
- I'm sorry?

949
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,515
I really like you

950
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,111
and I don't have
any money or insurance

951
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,816
or a valid credit card
or any of those things,

952
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,620
but I'll help you take care of this baby.

953
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,592
I will do whatever it takes.

954
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,687
I will step up big time.

955
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,192
I like you, too.

956
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,897
Cool.

957
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,597
Do you want to go make out in your car?

958
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:25,732
- Yeah.
- Really?

959
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,334
No, I don't have a car.

960
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,038
I don't have a car.

961
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,479
You know what?
I have a car.

962
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,016
- Yes!
- Okay.

963
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,254
Wait, wait, wait.
We should get a condom.

964
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,314
No, no.
I'm already pregnant.

965
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,087
God, I can't.

966
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,991
Wait. No, no, no.
You're pregnant.

967
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,359
What are we doing?

968
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,193
No, it's fine. Don't stop.

969
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,995
- Shit!
- Is everything okay?

970
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:55,162
Yeah. Sorry.
We were just leaving.

971
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,405
Little King? Shit.

972
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,535
Get the fuck out!

973
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,875
I was just thinking about you.

974
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,437
What's going on, brother?
How you doing?

975
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,278
- I'm good. How are you?
- It's so good to see you.

976
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,649
Did Youngblood over here
knock you up, little lady?

977
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,813
No, man.
It's not mine.

978
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,119
It's not even mine.

979
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,593
It's not?

980
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,893
No. It's... It's my sister's.

981
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,196
It's a surrogate.
I'm a surrogate.

982
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,133
She couldn't get pregnant, so...

983
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,364
I can't say no.

984
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,600
It's probably why I work for Patrick, so...

985
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,438
- You're serious?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

986
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,944
It's not even my egg.

987
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,207
It's just... It's just my oven.

988
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,578
- Wow.
- So to speak.

989
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:40,946
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

990
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,918
- Yeah.
- Thank God.

991
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,287
Are you guys good friends?

992
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,190
You didn't have to do this.

993
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,320
I didn't want you to have to ride the bus.

994
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,627
Jemma Brown?

995
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,401
You want me to go with you?

996
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,871
- I'll be okay.
- Okay.

997
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,987
Hey, it's me.

998
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,321
Hold on a second.

999
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,726
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Hold on a second.

1000
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:29,356
- What are you doing? You okay?
- I'm fine.

1001
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,470
- Were you getting high?
- What? No.

1002
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:43,876
- You weren't?
- No.

1003
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,346
- Really?
- Yes.

1004
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,811
Well, some people might see
getting high in a pediatrician's office

1005
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,788
as a cry for help.

1006
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,086
She's not my kid.

1007
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,717
But you probably knew that.

1008
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,056
Let's go.

1009
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:22,980
What'd you think?

1010
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,647
I want to make movies.

1011
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,290
You do?

1012
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,226
My mom used to take me to the movies.

1013
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,161
That was our thing.

1014
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,495
I kept all the tickets.

1015
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,332
I tape them to my ceiling.

1016
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,034
Maybe we could do this every week.

1017
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,204
I mean go to the movies

1018
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,372
instead of talking.

1019
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,210
You have no idea how tempting that is,

1020
01:00:57,286 --> 01:01:00,050
but I'm afraid we're gonna have to talk.

1021
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,454
I knew you were gonna say that.

1022
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,771
Hey!

1023
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,397
I see you!

1024
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:21,272
This place is a fortress, motherfucker.

1025
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,278
What the fuck are you trying to pull?

1026
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,576
That's right, you better run,
you motherfucker.

1027
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,718
That's from Ed Armstrong at Orion.

1028
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,586
You don't even know how fucked you are.

1029
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,218
You're not gonna be able to see a movie
in this goddamn town when l...

1030
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:41,286
Daisy.

1031
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:51,800
Okay.

1032
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,312
Hello?

1033
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,121
Evan?

1034
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,966
It's for you.

1035
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,969
Yo, this is Evan.
What's up?

1036
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,056
We should do this every night.

1037
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:48,992
We should start a band.

1038
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,659
What would our band be called?

1039
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,662
Let's think.

1040
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:57,968
The Neurotics.

1041
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,873
The Neurotics.
I love it.

1042
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,011
It's my fault.

1043
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:17,351
I should've seen it coming.

1044
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:23,426
I mean, all the friends we had are gone.

1045
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,793
I just have patients now.

1046
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,864
Well, you still have a step-godbrother.

1047
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,413
Who wants to be my patient?

1048
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,438
Jesus Christ Almighty,

1049
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,338
your face looks like
a truck driver's nutsack.

1050
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,376
Thanks, Dad.
It was a long night.

1051
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,274
Yeah, I bet.

1052
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,912
Been thinking about your dream.

1053
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,279
I thought you didn't do dreams.

1054
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,012
No, I don't.

1055
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,485
But in your case...

1056
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:29,388
"It's a comfort for seafarers to know

1057
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,656
"that no matter on what strange water
they may venture,

1058
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:38,166
"there are always pilots within call.

1059
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:45,296
But yet the sufferer must help himself."

1060
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,808
That's Kierkegaard.

1061
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,777
Love his work.

1062
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,643
Hey.

1063
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:34,923
I saw you at the movie.

1064
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,016
Yeah, so?

1065
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,494
Do you maybe want to have
a cup of coffee or something?

1066
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:41,894
Why?

1067
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,432
I think we might have a lot in common.

1068
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,524
Yeah. I gotta go.

1069
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,262
Wait, wait, wait.
My name's Jeremy.

1070
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,769
I'm a writer and I have a girlfriend.

1071
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,238
She's my age,
so I'm not a weirdo or anything.

1072
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:55,141
Look, I just would really like to have
a cup of coffee with you.

1073
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,444
You like school?

1074
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,353
I guess.

1075
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,084
You guess?

1076
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,558
Sounds like a "no" to me.

1077
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,528
It's all whatever.

1078
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,963
Whatever.

1079
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,968
That's a word I used

1080
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,470
many, many times when
I was in high school myself.

1081
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,238
Yeah, I actually...

1082
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:35,010
I actually got suspended
for a week because

1083
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,918
I wrote a report on this book
called The Anarchist's Cookbook.

1084
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,615
- What?
- It's this book...

1085
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,623
It basically tells you how to make bombs.

1086
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,626
I wasn't trying to make bombs,
but I was trying to do this report

1087
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:49,562
and show this subversive society, whatever.

1088
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,463
This whole big thing.

1089
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,367
What about you?
You ever get kicked out?

1090
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,995
Suspended or anything?

1091
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,275
What do you think?

1092
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,809
Probably.

1093
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,171
Probably.

1094
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,509
Yeah?

1095
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,880
Yeah? You did, didn't you?

1096
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:15,049
Do you want to go to this party
with me tonight?

1097
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,650
Really?

1098
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:43,104
All right, Jemma Brown.

1099
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,468
Dr. Carter?

1100
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:49,140
Would you like me to get you a razor?

1101
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,076
So you could shave?

1102
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,576
No.

1103
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,117
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

1104
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,413
Okay.

1105
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,011
I'm here with Dr. Henry Carter.

1106
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,786
Him, the shrink of the stars.

1107
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:07,090
He's a therapist practicing in Los Angeles.

1108
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,529
- A bestselling author...
- Hey, babe.

1109
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,032
That's your guy, isn't it?

1110
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,968
Including, of course, his 1995 classic...

1111
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,699
- Yeah.
...Stop Feeling Sad.

1112
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,970
Doctor, it's good to have you here.

1113
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:30,481
Tonight's topic is suicide,

1114
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,679
with the implicit question...

1115
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,189
Why do they do it?

1116
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:40,058
Can you shed some light
on this dark topic for us?

1117
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,526
"Why do they do it?"
That's your question?

1118
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,194
Yes.

1119
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,014
I ought to know.

1120
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,356
My wife committed suicide.

1121
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,397
She wrote me a letter.

1122
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:16,726
A note.

1123
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,892
You're supposed to call it a note.

1124
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:28,573
I'm a fraud.
A big fraud.

1125
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:33,173
Do you honestly believe
what you're saying?

1126
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:34,772
This book.

1127
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:37,277
This book.

1128
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,947
I wrote this book
to feel better about myself.

1129
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,435
Don't buy this book.

1130
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,302
It's bullshit.

1131
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,666
Don't buy this book.

1132
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,819
It's all bullshit.

1133
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,444
It's all bullshit, and then you die.

1134
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,024
We knew that going in.

1135
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,728
Sorry, I gotta take this.

1136
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,821
Hello.

1137
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,359
Oh, my God.

1138
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:23,181
What would make somebody
do something like that?

1139
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,124
Take a shit on my goddamn porch.

1140
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,869
Hey. Are you poking my assistant?

1141
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,203
'Cause I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's pregnant,

1142
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,969
and that's just fucking gross.

1143
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,376
You really like her.

1144
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,711
Yeah.

1145
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,551
Yeah, she's a good kid.

1146
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,481
Don't tell her I said that.

1147
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,291
You guys can go home.

1148
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:02,694
- We'll stay.
- No, really.

1149
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,096
I got my best man on it.

1150
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,377
Is this the John Belushi suite?

1151
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,751
What does it say?

1152
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,516
Let's see. Cocaine.

1153
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,113
Amphetamines.

1154
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:33,594
Klonopin. Soma?

1155
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:35,289
Alcohol.

1156
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:39,090
You have a drinking problem, my friend.

1157
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,067
I'm Irish.

1158
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,467
What the fuck is Ketamine?

1159
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,801
- It's a horse tranquilizer.
- Of course it is.

1160
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:00,646
You may want to stand up
for this next part.

1161
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,849
You fucking kidding?

1162
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:11,755
I did it with Keira.

1163
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,734
- You what?
- I had sex with Keira.

1164
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:15,861
We fucked.

1165
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,634
So, if you need to come at me,
if you want to take a swing,

1166
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,231
whatever you gotta do
to make this right between us,

1167
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,675
I completely understand.

1168
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,854
I'm not fucking doing the asteroid movie.

1169
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,104
Have you been up all night?

1170
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,071
Yes.

1171
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,181
It's done.

1172
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:09,717
Oh, my God.

1173
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:16,061
Patrick? Read this.

1174
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,655
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

1175
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:21,499
No, I really want you to read this.

1176
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,505
Come on, Daisy, just give me the gist.

1177
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:29,843
When's the last time
you actually read a whole script?

1178
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,674
Read? I don't need to read, Daisy.

1179
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,578
I have an agile mind.

1180
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,241
Do you even like movies?

1181
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,842
When's the last time you actually
sat through a whole movie?

1182
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,716
1997, Titanic.
Way too long.

1183
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:42,757
Spoiler alert... the boat sinks.

1184
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:49,393
Patrick, I have never
asked you for anything,

1185
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,398
and now I'm asking you to do something.

1186
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,297
Just fucking read it, okay?

1187
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,555
Okay.

1188
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,092
Today's gonna be
our last session, all right?

1189
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,593
I just need you to know that.

1190
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,892
- Why?
- It's not about you.

1191
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:57,556
All right? It's me.

1192
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,691
Is it because you went crazy on TV?

1193
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:07,706
Look, I'm gonna give you
the name of a colleague.

1194
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,073
He's very, very good.

1195
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,612
He's gonna... What's that?

1196
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,875
I want you to read it.

1197
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,917
It's not addressed to me.

1198
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:19,647
If it says anything about why it happened,
I want you to tell me.

1199
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,561
Is this what I think it is?

1200
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,578
Does it say why?

1201
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,243
You tell them the next
communication from them

1202
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,789
better be an offer on the table,
or this is over.

1203
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,449
Yes.

1204
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,187
No. I've heard it so much.
I'm done.

1205
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:09,753
I'm done with them.
Do you understand? I'm done.

1206
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:44,959
How you doing?

1207
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:51,631
I saw you on TV.
That was dope.

1208
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,968
Two sacks of dankness, please.

1209
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:01,147
All right, word.

1210
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,808
Wait, wait, wait.
What's that?

1211
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,181
- What's what? This?
- Yeah.

1212
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,015
- You don't want that.
- Why not? What is it?

1213
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:09,921
Because that's some break-the-glass-
in-case-of-emergency type shit.

1214
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,322
- And I don't...
- That sounds perfect.

1215
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:14,055
- I don't...
- Yeah, I want this.

1216
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:23,003
75.

1217
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,020
Hey.

1218
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,221
What's up?

1219
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,111
Jemma.

1220
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,118
Please wait.

1221
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,744
- I was going to tell you.
- Tell me what?

1222
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,449
That you were hanging out
with me for research?

1223
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,356
I am your friend.
Can't you tell that?

1224
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,121
I mean, it's all in there.

1225
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:22,857
They're just words.

1226
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,729
They don't mean anything.

1227
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,472
You're in it, too.

1228
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:39,137
I didn't know anything about this.

1229
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:44,418
He must have read your...

1230
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:47,216
I trusted you.

1231
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:11,109
How fucking dare you?

1232
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:15,343
That was my patient's file
you fucking stole, you dick.

1233
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:17,180
- No, listen.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

1234
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:18,480
Listen to me. Listen.
Did you read it?

1235
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,077
Did I read it?
What is this, a fucking workshop?

1236
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:21,520
If you read it,
you might understand what l...

1237
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:24,615
Damn you, son of a...

1238
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:27,126
Jesus...

1239
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:28,992
You all right, J?

1240
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,624
- No.
- Jesus.

1241
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,599
- Come on, man, I got you.
- Fucking Christ.

1242
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,659
Fuck!

1243
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,501
Punched by Pablo Escobar.
Jesus Christ.

1244
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,507
Hope you have a nice career, you cunt.

1245
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,940
Get the fuck out of here, asshole.

1246
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,341
No, no, no.
Don't say that.

1247
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,470
- Who was that guy?
- He's my godbrother.

1248
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,071
Fuck.

1249
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:04,310
Jesus?

1250
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,418
Hey, man. Fuck.

1251
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,984
Fucking Christmas in Vietnam.

1252
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,531
- What?
- That's what we smoked.

1253
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:18,861
I smoked them, too.

1254
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:21,197
They were fucking laced in embalming fluid.

1255
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,260
Man, I'm...

1256
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,828
I'm sorry. I didn't...

1257
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,636
I didn't know.

1258
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:29,769
Wow.

1259
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:33,275
Are you mad at me?

1260
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:35,908
No.

1261
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,781
I appreciate that.

1262
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,581
Yeah, no worries.

1263
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:42,020
What are you doing here?

1264
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,648
I found you.

1265
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:46,888
I rode in the ambulance.

1266
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,631
I think they have me on a lot of drugs.

1267
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,363
You're on some painkillers.

1268
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,428
You fell pretty hard.

1269
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:00,770
I fell?

1270
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,833
I don't remember.

1271
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,140
You also have a lot of toxins in your system.

1272
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,477
Yeah, embalming fluid.

1273
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,540
That was my bad.
I'm sorry about that.

1274
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,347
I love your work, though.

1275
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,685
Where's August?

1276
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,294
Caroline gave him to me.

1277
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:43,243
Happiness.

1278
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,980
"Happiness" is a word for a feeling.

1279
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,616
Feelings are rarely understood
in the moment.

1280
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,215
They are quickly forgotten

1281
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:54,227
and almost always mis-remembered.

1282
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:16,808
"Dear Henry..."

1283
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,047
You've been my assistant now

1284
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:01,289
for, what, a little over a year?

1285
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:04,354
No, two years, actually.

1286
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:06,059
Last month was our anniversary.

1287
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:12,997
What do you think of me?

1288
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:16,043
I mean really.
What do you think of me?

1289
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:23,011
I think... I think you have your moments.

1290
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,314
Really?

1291
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:27,980
Yeah.

1292
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:31,149
Good. 'Cause you're fucking fired.

1293
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,693
What?

1294
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:34,921
You're fucking fired.

1295
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,023
Wow. No.

1296
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:39,532
This is because I'm pregnant.

1297
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,726
But you know what?

1298
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,633
I promise my water
is not gonna break on you.

1299
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,136
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I have a scheduled C-section.

1300
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:45,832
There's no chance...

1301
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,638
You want to be a producer, right?

1302
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,145
Yeah, but how would you know that?

1303
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,205
I've never told you that.

1304
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,114
I read all your emails
when you first started.

1305
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:58,345
I didn't know I could trust you.

1306
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:00,851
Obviously.

1307
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:06,292
But now, I think when you
push that baby out,

1308
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,225
it's time you start making your first film.

1309
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:15,328
All right.

1310
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:16,995
She in there?

1311
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:19,301
Yeah, she's in there.

1312
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:20,840
Excellent. Daisy?

1313
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,808
- Yeah?
- Please listen.

1314
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:24,504
- Okay.
- When you are a producer,

1315
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:28,345
and you wish to hire one of my clients,
I'm gonna take you to the wall.

1316
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:30,077
No hard feelings.

1317
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,085
I am going to take you to the wall.

1318
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,815
- Okay, yeah, no.
- Great.

1319
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,880
Want to open the door?

1320
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,050
Yeah, of course.

1321
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,150
You don't have to.
You're fucking fired.

1322
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:42,788
No, I just... Oh, God.

1323
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,108
Thank you.

1324
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:01,713
What are you doing here?

1325
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:03,443
I have a meeting.
What the fuck are you doing here?

1326
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,576
Same.

1327
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,251
How's your face?

1328
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:11,586
Feels worse than it looks.

1329
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:12,785
Looks pretty awful.

1330
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:15,488
Yeah. How's yours?

1331
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:17,053
I almost died.

1332
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:19,326
It's not your fault.

1333
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:22,569
Come in. Welcome.
Have a seat.

1334
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:24,036
Hey.

1335
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:26,039
Apparently, everybody knows
everybody here.

1336
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:27,506
What is everyone doing here?

1337
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:29,133
All will be revealed.

1338
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,609
Have a seat.

1339
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:41,847
This is some situation we got here.

1340
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:44,687
- I'm really sorry.
- Look, no. It's my responsibility.

1341
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:47,159
- You were right, Jemma.
- No, this is the worst thing I've ever done.

1342
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,490
- Would you let me finish...
- I'm so...

1343
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:49,621
It's good.

1344
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:52,431
What's good?

1345
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,264
This. This is good.

1346
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:03,705
You think so?
You really think so?

1347
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:16,785
I think what my client is trying to say

1348
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:19,018
is we are making this movie.

1349
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:39,510
You're what's-his-name.

1350
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:40,877
Jack.

1351
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:45,151
Jack what?

1352
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:47,153
- Holden.
- Jack Holden.

1353
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:49,416
- Yeah.
- Jack.

1354
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:53,390
You're a naughty boy, aren't you, Jack?

1355
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,292
- Could be.
- Really?

1356
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:57,831
Yeah.

1357
01:33:57,898 --> 01:34:00,458
Whoa.

1358
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:10,738
Ten years ago,

1359
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:12,972
that would've been a yes.

1360
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:17,479
I would've been in fourth grade.

1361
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:18,540
Ten years ago.

1362
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,089
Yeah.

1363
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:24,784
My daughter's in fourth grade.

1364
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,595
Good-bye, bad girl.

1365
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,931
Hey.

1366
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:42,737
She said you were out here.

1367
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,778
Used to smoke a lot of weed out here.

1368
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,942
What about now?

1369
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:53,543
Not anymore.

1370
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:55,020
That's good.

1371
01:35:06,434 --> 01:35:08,459
It's never gonna go away, is it?

1372
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:11,061
No.

1373
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,267
But we're still here.

1374
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:18,201
That's something.

1375
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,577
Am I gonna see you again?

1376
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:27,779
No, never.

1377
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:33,519
You know where to find me.

1378
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:36,987
Yeah.

1379
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:40,991
Yeah.

1380
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,578
Look, they're not gonna make me
share a fucking room, are they?

1381
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:53,203
No, I got you a private suite.

1382
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,941
It's the best one they got.

1383
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:59,349
It's gonna be just like staying
at a fancy hotel for a couple of months.

1384
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,354
Without the minibar.

1385
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:15,802
I don't want to see you anymore.

1386
01:36:18,839 --> 01:36:22,036
Professionally.
