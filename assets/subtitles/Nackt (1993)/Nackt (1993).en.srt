00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,320

00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,280
You fuckin' dead!

5
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,520
Oi! Come back 'ere, you!

6
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,480
Ronnie !

7
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
Geroff that couch and come out 'ere!

8
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,840
Oh, shit!
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

9
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,200
Do you live 'ere?

10
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Yeah, I do unfortunately.

11
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,400
Do you know Louise Clancy ?

12
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah. Are you friend of hers?

13
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,800
Know where she is?

14
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
She's at work

15
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,320
What time does she get back?

16
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,400
Dunno. About seven or something

17
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
Fuckin' hell !

18
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,360
D'you wanna come in for a cuppa tea?

19
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
Is it alright with you, love?

20
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
It's just, you know, cold

21
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Listen, have you got anything
for a headache?

22
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Ah, yeah, we 'ave as it 'appens

23
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,000
You know, like a monkey-wrench
or somethin'

24
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,880
What's all this about?

25
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh yeah, that's Sandra, that is

26
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,720
Hallo, Sandra.

27
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,800
This is 'er place

28
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,520
She's a fuckin' nurse

29
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,920
That's 'er idea of interior design

30
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
Oh yeah - it's a skeletion

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,040
And this is 'er cocktail cabinet,
an' all

32
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
There you go, that should do it

33
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,000
No, it's too big

34
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
D'you want a cuppa tea?

35
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,320
So are you Louise's boyfriend?

36
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
No.

37
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,520
Oh, right. 
What, you're just like a mate?

38
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
Primate

39
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,600
You must be the missing link then

40
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah, that's me

41
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
You're not gonna tell me your name?

42
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,280
No.

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm not gonna tell you mine neither

44
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,800
All right, we'll be strangers

45
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,520
- I see your boomerang came back then, love
- It's not my fuckin' boomerang

46
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
What about the old diminishing
pachyderm formation there?

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,480
No, that's all Sandra's collection

48
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
She's in Zimbabwe at the moment.

49
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,600
And fuck knows what she's gonna
bring back from there

50
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
Pellagra or hepatitis B or something.

51
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,080
She's with her boyfriend

52
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,320
So how is Louise?

53
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,200
I dunno.
I don't know 'er as well as you.

54
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,320
D'you get on with 'er?

55
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,440
We've been out a couple o' times.

56
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Does she like you?

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
I dunno - you'd better ask 'er.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,720
Most people don't.

59
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Do you find she's at all
jealous of you?

60
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
So, I dunno, would you describe
yourself as a happy little person?

61
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeah, I'm the life and soul

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,760
Have you ever thought, right

63
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
I mean, you don't know,

64
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
but you may already 'ave had

65
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
the happiest moment in your whole
fuckin' life

66
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,720
and all you've got to look
forward to is sickness

67
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,960
and purgatory?

68
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, shit!

69
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,400
Well, I just live from day to day,
meself.

70
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,800
I tend to skip a day now and again -
you know what I mean?

71
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
I used to be a werewolf,

72
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,480
- But I'm all right noowwww!!
- Oh, fuckin' 'ell !!

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,200
I bet they're 'appy, eh?

74
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,320
All they gotta do is sit round,
howlin' at the moon.

75
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,120
It's better than standin' on the
cheesy fuckin' thing. Know what I mean?

76
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,080
I mean, tossin' all these satellites
and shuttles out into the cosmos -

77
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
what do they think they're gonna find
up there that they can't find down 'ere?

78
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,200
They think if they piss high enough,

79
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,320
they're gonna come across the monkey
with the beard and the crap ideas,

80
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,680
and it's like, 'Oh!
There you are Captain!

81
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,000
I mean , are you busy, because I've got
a few fundamental questions for you!'

82
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Are you with me?

83
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,520
Yeah, 'cos let's face it, right,
what are rockets?

84
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,600
I mean, they're just,
big metal pricks!

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know, I mean, the bastards aren't 
satisfied with fuckin' the earth up -

86
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,480
they've gotta fuck space an' all.

87
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,720
Will you tell me something, love?

88
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,360
Are you aware of the effect you
have on the average

89
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,600
mammalian, Mancunian,

90
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,280
X-Y-ly-chromosome, slavering,
lusty male member

91
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,520
of the species?

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,520
- Yeah
- I thought so.

93
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,080
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

94
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,400
No !

95
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,760
Do you think women like being raped?

96
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
You talk a lot, don't you?

97
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,600
Do you like japanese food?

98
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,600
Look, I've told you -  
I'm not interested.

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,760
All right?

100
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,320
Could I have that a touch harder,
please?

101
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,760
All right? Enjoyin' yourself, are you?

102
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,760
I'm 'aving a great time, actually

103
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,200
Bloody 'ell

104
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,960
Oh, friendly!

105
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,600
What are you doin' 'ere?
You look like shit.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Just trying to blend in

107
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
with the surroundings

108
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
Halitosis, halitosis, halitosis!

109
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,480
Can't believe you're 'ere

110
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm not 'ere.

111
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,360
I'll tell you what, it's a crackin'
place you've got, love.

112
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,600
Good. I'm glad you like it.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
No, I was been sarcastic.

114
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,200
Why didn't you tell me you were comin'?
I would a' met you off the train.

115
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,480
I didn't come on the fuckin' train.

116
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
- Off the bus, then.
- I didn't come on the bus either.

117
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,560
So 'ow did you get 'ere then?

118
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,160
Well, basically, there was this little
dot, right? And the dot went bang,

119
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,480
and the bang expanded,

120
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,600
energy formed into matter, matter cooled,
matter lived, the amoeba to fish, the fish 
to fowl, the fowl to frog, the frog to mammal

121
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
the mammal to monkey,
the monkey to man.

122
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,160
Amo, amas, amat, quid pro quo,
memento mori,

123
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,080
ad infinitum, sprinkle on a little bit
of grated cheese and leave under
the grill till Doomsday.

124
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,600
I see you 'aven't changed.

125
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,800
'e's a fuckin' genius, this geezer!

126
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,120
I take it you've met my wicky-wacky
friend Sophie?

127
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,600
No, actually, we 'aven't been
formally introduced, 'ave we, love?

128
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,560
No, we've been sat 'ere in

129
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
embarassin' silence all afternoon.

130
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
So , 'ow are you?

131
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,680
Peachy-creamy.

132
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,440
Are you really? I'm very pleased.

133
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,920
So how's, um, work?

134
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
It's all right.

135
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,040
Is it everything you hoped it would be?

136
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,800
What did you hope it would be?

137
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry - did you get that?

138
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,760
It's everything she hoped it would be,

139
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
but she doesn't fuckin' know
what she hoped it would be!

140
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,320
Oh, and by the way. Thank you for this!

141
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,280
I mean, are you tekkin' the piss,

142
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
or what?

143
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,560
'So, Johnny... My address is'

144
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm touched.

145
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
- Why 'ave you come?
- Oh, can you tell from there?

146
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,120
D'you want a cup o'tea?

147
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I'd love a cup o'tea. You're fuckin'

148
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,880
generous, you cockerneys, aren't yer?

149
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,680
Yeah. Ta.

150
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
'ow's yer mam?

151
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,600
Fine. 'ow's yours? Still pullin' pints?

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
She's dead. She's still a good fuck,
though.

153
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,800
I mean the rates are a bit extortionate,
but I do get a discount,
what with being the son and everything.

154
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,600
Apparently, right, you shouldn't stick

155
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,400
anything up your cunt

156
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,800
you can't put in your mouth.

157
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,400
Give us that mug.

158
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,400
Can I try your coat on, Johnny?

159
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,840
So what you've been up to?
'ave you seen anybody?

160
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Have you seen anybody?

161
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,720
Have you spoken to anybody
from Manchester?

162
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,520
Yeah, I've phoned June
a couple o' times.

163
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,440
And was June interested in what
you had to say?

164
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,560
Fuckin' hell. I've seen more life
in an open grave. Come on!!

165
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,280
- What?
- What?! I mean, you don't not
seem very pleased to see me.

166
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,080
I am pleased to see you!

167
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,800
Are you too good for us? Now you've got
yourself a posh job in a big 'shitty'?

168
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,720
I mean, me an''her

169
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,720
- are on the fuckin' dole, aren't we?
- Right!

170
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,120
And you're a carrier girl - are you 
happy with that? Are you sure?

171
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm delighted

172
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
D'you want some o' this,

173
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Johnny ?

174
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,400
Fuckin' 'ell love, what're you
trying to do to me?

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Right, well,

176
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm going up to me room. D'you want
to see it, Johnny?

177
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,160
Is it worth the bother?

178
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Is there anything worth seein'?

179
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,600
Why don't you come and find out?
It's not very far.

180
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,680
I'm sorry about this.

181
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,880
Move! Move!

182
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,600
Where are you?

183
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm in 'ere.

184
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,280
Oh, it's de-lovely.

185
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,600
I see you've got a ceiling at the top
with a floor on the lower level,

186
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,360
and a wall at either side.

187
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,320
And only a single bed. Sad, really

188
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
You've got wonderful breasts

189
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't you mean tits?

190
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,560
Are they both of the same size,

191
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
or is one bigger than the other?

192
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,080
I don't know. Do you want to weigh them?

193
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Is that a proposition?

194
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,120
No, it's a threat.

195
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,800
Are you rich?

196
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
- Life is for enjoying.
- What's about family,

197
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,520
have you got any brothers or sisters?

198
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,000
I try not to remember.

199
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,840
You are sexually

200
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,200
frustrated, aren't you?

201
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,920
- What's funny?
- Are you a feminist?

202
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,680
- Do you like fucking?
- Do you like wanking?

203
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Not on my own, no.

204
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,320
That's a very ornithological mutilation
you've got here, love.

205
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,600
That's my tribal initiation

206
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,880
It is really?

207
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,200
That was fuckin' athletic, that was.

208
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,880
I think I've ruptured my chakras.

209
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,880
Is there an instruction manual
for this garb?

210
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,600
No, it's an intelligence test.

211
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,160
Well what is this? A granny,
a sheepshank,

212
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,840
or the infamous round-turn and
two half-hitches,

213
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,840
as mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel?

214
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Have you finished?

215
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,600
I've hardly fuckin' begun.

216
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,960
It's just that I think I'm gonna get into
difficulties when I read the hippy-shit
up here, you know what I mean?

217
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,760
Yeah, well, you've tried the stairs.

218
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,840
I think we should take the escalator.

219
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,640
Simple really. So's this.

220
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,920
Oh. Thanks for the mammaries.

221
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,320
Could you ask her to order me a taxi,

222
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,360
please?

223
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,600
This is terribly disappointing

224
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,520
You don't like rejection, do you,

225
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,680
- Jeremy?
- Could we have a taxi, please?

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,640
No problem, sir.

227
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,680
It's really cozy, this.

228
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
Will you let me come again, Jerry?

229
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,000
You're dead handsome, you know.

230
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,840
What work d'you do?

231
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm a dancer, actually.

232
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,080
Do you want to know me name?

233
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,440
It's Giselle.

234
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,640
Are you married?

235
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,360
Wha' ?

236
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Kiss me.

237
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,680
Don't, it's yucky! Get it off!

238
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,680
Are you glad I came?

239
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,120
What are you doin'? Get off me!!

240
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,200
You're hurting me!

241
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,920
Have you ever thought of committing

242
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,960
suicide?

243
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,520
I'm going to commit suicide.

244
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,240
on my fortieth birthday.

245
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,760
If I'm still around.

246
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,560
- Why?
- I don't want to be old.

247
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Do you?

248
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
Oh. 'Ave a fag

249
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah. Thanks, I will

250
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
What you're readin'?

251
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,800
Would you stop fuckin' about and
fidgetin' in my peripherals -

252
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,040
I'm trying to concentrate.

253
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
She's got a very little waist,
Sophie, an't she?

254
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,360
She's got little tits an' all

255
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,760
Are you not cold?

256
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,120
- I'm reading about the Butterfly Effect.
- What's the Butterfly Effect?

257
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,280
Every time a butterfly flaps
its wings in Tokyo,

258
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
this old granny in Salford
gets a bilious attack..

259
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,160
What happens if a butterfly
flaps it's wings in Salford?

260
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,440
That's not the point.

261
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh, is it not?

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What are you doin' in London, Johnny?

263
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,680
What are you doin' in London?

264
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,320
I've told you what I'm doin' in London.

265
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,800
You've told me nothing.

266
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,840
The last time I saw you,

267
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,880
- I told you -
- Fuckin' hell! Were you born irritatin'?

268
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,800
What you came downstairs for anyway?

269
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,440
I fell asleep with the window open.
I was cold. I came down.

270
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,280
I 'ad to pee, I've made some tea,
I'm 'ere, all right?

271
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,000
What's that? The greatest story
ever told?

272
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,400
I live 'ere

273
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,280
So what 'appened? Were you bored

274
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,120
in Manchester?

275
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Was I bored? No I wasn't fuckin' bored.

276
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm never bored. That's the trouble
with everybody - you're all so bored.

277
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,040
You've 'ad nature explained to you
and you're bored with it.

278
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,680
You've 'ad the living body explained
to you and you're bored with it,

279
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
You've had the universe explained
to you and you're bored with it.

280
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,160
So now you just want cheap thrills and 
like plenty of 'em and it dun't matter

281
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,840
'ow tawdry or vacuous they are as
long as it's new, as long as it's new,

282
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,640
as long as it flashes and fuckin'
bleeps in forty fuckin' different colors.

283
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,040
Well, whatever else you can say
about me, I'm not fuckin' bored!

284
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,280
Yeah, all right.

285
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,400
So 'ow's it all goin' for you?

286
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,040
It's a bit borin', actually.

287
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,240
Are you not enjoyin' yourself?

288
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,440
Have you made many friends?

289
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,000
No

290
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,800
'Ave you got, erm, a goblet or
something, because me heart's bleedin'.

291
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,760
When you goin' back to Manchester?

292
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,000
When you goin' back to Manchester?

293
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,680
I'm not going back

294
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,440
- Why not?
- You know why not

295
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,320
Do I?

296
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,200
I thought you said you never
wanted to see me again

297
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,680
I don't want to ever see you again, so
why you just don't fuck off back upstairs?

298
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,040
Why are you such a bastard, Johnny?

299
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,040
- Monkey see, monkey do.
- And what does that mean?

300
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh, this fuckin' cough.

301
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,840
A butterfly must'ave flapped it's wings.

302
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,920
So, have you got to get up for
work now, yeah?

303
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,680
No. It's too early.

304
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,040
I'm going back to bed.

305
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,800
So is she a - a Buddhist or something,
this nurse?

306
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,080
No, she's a Catholic.

307
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,920
What's she doin' with the old
fat chap in the house, then?

308
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
Dunno, I think she fancies him
or somethin'.

309
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,400
Louise is a Catholic, did you
know that?

310
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,600
She's not, is she?

311
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
Oh, fuckin' hell!

312
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,600
You know what frightens me about
the human body?

313
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,720
What?

314
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, it's like the most sophisticated
mechanism in the entire universe,

315
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,000
and yet it's so fuckin' quiet, in't it?

316
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,120
know what I mean?

317
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,360
Dunno... Mine makes enough noise.

318
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,640
It's like this wet, pink factory.

319
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
What the fuck are they makin'
in there? I mean what's the product?

320
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,760
You never see no delivery trucks
comin' or goin', do you?

321
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,400
I could've been a doctor.

322
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,880
D'you wanna examine me?

323
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,680
You don't believe me, do you?

324
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,560
I believe everything you say.

325
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
I've got A-level Psychology.

326
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,840
You 'aven't!

327
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,080
"Resolve is never stronger

328
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
than in the morning after the
night it was never weaker".

329
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,400
What d'you think of that?

330
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,680
It's a load of bollocks.

331
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,560
I thought of that.

332
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,400
D'you not agree with it?

333
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,320
Dunno

334
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,640
Yeah, well, that's 'cos you weren't
fuckin' listening, were you?

335
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,800
What's this? A test or somethin'?

336
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,080
Don't! Stop it!

337
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,360
Just pack it in! Stop it!

338
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,840
Stop buggering about!

339
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,840
You could get me a watch, Johnny

340
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,520
Will you just keep still?!

341
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,640
Look, you could get me a watch

342
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,120
I'm not gonna get you a watch -
you don't want a fuckin' watch!!

343
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,600
I really like you, Johnny.

344
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,880
You don't know me.

345
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,680
I think I do.

346
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,560
You don't fuckin' -

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,040

348

349
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400

350
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,520
Don't laught - I'm serious, uh!

351
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,920
I understand you Johnny, I do.

352
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,960
Ta-ra, Mr. Halpern.

353
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What's the matter? What's going on?

354
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,160
Fucked if I know.

355
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm too old for all this.

356
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,400
Why don't we go out ?
Go for a drink or somethin'?

357
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,320
Why don't you fuckin' go out?
Go for a drink or somethin'?

358
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,960
'Cos I wanna go with you!

359
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,000

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,000
What are you doin'?
Where are you goin'?

361
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,080
I'm cold!

362
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,800
- Johnny, I just -
- Fuck off!

363
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,640
Fuckin' hell! D'you ever get the feelin'
that you're bein' followed?

364
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,280
Look, will you just leave me alone -
give me a bit of room or somethin'?

365
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,000
Fuckin' hell!

366
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,800
What's all that about?
What you're playing at?

367
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,880
- Where are you going, Johnny?
- Off my head.

368
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,240
- I'm comin' with you.
- No, you're not.

369
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
- I wanna come with you!
- I don't want to you fuckin' come with me!

370
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,720
Are you coming back?

371
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,960
What the fuck for?

372
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
Maggie !

373
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,800
Maggie !

374
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,200
You all right there, chief?

375
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,800
'Ave you lost somebody?

376
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,440
Are you looking for somebody?

377
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,680
Fuck off, cunt!!

378
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Got a fag?

379
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,560
- Yes, thanks.

380
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,920

381
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,760

382
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,960
Say please.

383
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,600
Just fuckin' giz one. Come on, mister!

384
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,480
You've got a lovely way about you -
'as anybody ever told you that?

385
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,560
'Thank you. That's all right.'

386
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,760
Maggie !

387
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
She's gone, mate!

388
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
Those days are over.

389
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,680
Have you seen a lassie wanderin'
aboot here?

390
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,800
What?

391
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,120
A lassie. Black hair, blue jeans.

392
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,440
I saw a little Border collie padding
off down there towards a fire.

393
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,000
Where?

394
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,640
'Ave you lost your bird or somethin'?

395
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,120
Aye. Have you've seen her? Black hair?

396
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,080
- No
- Fuckin' hell! Stupid fuckin'
cunt's gone

397
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
and got lost.

398
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,720
- You're from Scotland?
- Uh?

399
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,400
- Are you scots?
- Aye.

400
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,640
What's it like up there?

401
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,160
Fuckin' shite! I'll kick her fanny in.

402
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,240
- D'you dream in Scotch?
- Uh?

403
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,560
Like, dream about sporran-clad,
caber-tossin'

404
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,920
haggis, gallopin' over
porridge-covered glens?

405
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,400
Talking shite.

406
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,240
Yeah, well, I sent off for one of those
Linguaphone packages,
'Talk Shite in a Fortnight' -

407
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,800
't's all goin' very well. I haven't quite
got the hang of the transitive verbs yet, but -

408
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,840
Will you fuckin' shut it, eh?!

409
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,960
- What you're doing down here?
- Eh?

410
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,200
Why are you here in London,
O Bodhidharma?

411
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,760
Put my old man in hospital.

412
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,720
- Your dad?
- Ah.

413
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,520
- 'Ow did you do that, then?
- Cracked 'im on the nut wi' a poker.

414
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,000
- What for?
- 'E was fuckin' asking for it!

415
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,440
So what, is 'e in a bad way?

416
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,440
Fuckin' right. He's 'alf dead.

417
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,160
What does you mam think about it?

418
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,600
She's off 'er fuckin' nut.

419
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,600
So you're like on the run, yeah?

420
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,280
- Aye.
- Yeah, me too.

421
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,160
Yeah? The cops after you? Yeah?

422
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,280
- Can you tell me something', Jock.
- Uh?

423
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
What's all that about?

424
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
That. The old Highland fling,
there. D'you know you're doing that?

425
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,080
- What? - That, you know -
'And now for my next tic...'. That.

426
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,400
Look, it, it just happened again -
I'm not imaginin' it.

427
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,600
Fuck off, eh?

428
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,360
D'you do that in a sack with the
old tic, spit, 'Eh, Maggie!'?

429
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,760
You must be a great fuckin' shag.

430
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,800
You takin' the piss?!

431
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,920
You're fuckin' givin' it away,
aren't yer?

432
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,400
Fuckin' come on, cunt!
Kick your fucking' head open!!

433
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,800
What's it like being you?

434
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,920
Bit hectic?

435
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,640
Fuck off, poof!

436
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,720
Do you believe in self-fulfillin'
prophecies?

437
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,840
You know, like, Nostradamus?

438
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,040
'E was like this sixteenth-century
astrologer.

439
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,960
An''e wrote in one of 'is quatrains
that this goon called Hister would invade Poland.

440
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,000
So Hitler reads it, and thinks
'Hister: Hitler. Must mean me',

441
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
and invades Poland.

442
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,120
So when the guy prophesied that the
world would end in 1999, which 'e did,

443
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,840
does that therefore mean that
we're fulfilling the prophecy

444
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,560
by precipitatin' the Apocalypse?

445
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,360
Are you with me?

446
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,840
Do you think the world will end in 1999?

447
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,920
Listen, mate, what d'you think
to this?

448
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,160
Why don't you 'ave a little wander round
and go look for the wee lassie,
an' I'll wait 'ere?

449
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,240
And if she turns up, I'll keep 'er 'ere
till you get back? 'Ow does that grab you?

450
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,400
Are you're gonna be here, aye?

451
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,120
Right. If she gets back, right,
tell her to fuckin' wait
here till I get back.

452
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,240
If she wanders off, knock her oot.
And slap her gob for me, right?

453
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,520
- Yeah, I'll tie her up.
- Aye.

454
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
- You're gonna be here, aye?
- Yeah.

455
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, listen, what's her name again?

456
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,520
Maggie.

457
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,720
- Oh, yeah.
- Will back in a minute, right?

458
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Excuse me, love.

459
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Hallo?!

460
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,240
Are you Maggie ?

461
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,160
Piss off!

462
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,480
- Oh, you're Maggie ?
- Wha' ?

463
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,560
- Is your name Maggie ?
- How d'ye ken that?

464
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,400
It's just a hunch.
Are you looking for the petulant dwarf?

465
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,760
Sprechen Sie Deutsch ?

466
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,680
Archie !

467
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,600
Yeah, that's the fella.
I was told to wait 'ere for you.

468
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,200
You, Maggie, 'e's, Archie, I'm nobody -
'e's gone off looking for you, love.

469
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,200
What, you've seen 'um?

470
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,960
Look, would you come and sit
over 'ere, now?

471
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
Fuck off, you dirty cunt!

472
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,480
Yeah, well, I know I've not 'ad
bath for a good few seasons,

473
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,240
but there's no need to 'urt my feelin's.

474
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,840
'E'll be back in a minute!

475
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,280
What, he's been here?

476
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,200
He's been here. He's been there.
He's been all over the fuckin' shop.

477
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,680
And did 'e 'ave the chips wi' 'um?

478
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,920
He had a huge one on 'is shoulder.

479
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,920
Fuckin' wee radge!

480
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,840
Oh, come now, there's no need
to knock the young lad,

481
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,400
He's a wonderful exponent of
the old Socratic debate.

482
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,440
Listen love, I've got this great idea.

483
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,200
Why don't you 'ave a little wander round,
see if you can find the wee lad,
an' I wait 'ere.

484
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,760
An' if 'e turns up, I'll keep
'im 'ere until you get back

485
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,440
I'm fuckin' starvin'.

486
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
D'you wanna get somethin' to eat?

487
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,480
He's got all money, hasn't 'e?

488
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,480
- Who? Laughing Boy?
- Aye.

489
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,680
Well, I've got a few bob on me.

490
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,440
And what if he comes back when
noone's here?

491
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,480
We'll leave 'em a note

492
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,000
He'll no be able to read it.

493
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,760
Well, we'll get 'im on his bleeper -
come on

494
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,000
Can you feel all those vibrations?

495
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,200
Wha'?

496
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,080
Just stand still a minute, love.
Try and feel it through your feet.

497
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,400
D'you not get all those tremblin's and
rumblin's comin' up through your bones?

498
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,640
Not really, no.

499
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,320
D'you not get like a sense of, like,
a whole other world underneath all this?

500
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,360
You know like the guts of London?

501
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,120
What with all the tube trains and everything,
the city's viscera and the subterranean fuckin'

502
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,840
fistulas and conduits and colons and bunkers

503
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,520
and dungeons and tombs an' all that?

504
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,600
What about Hell? And the sewers, like?

505
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,640
- You know that wherever you are in London,
you're only 30 feet away from a rat?
- Aye?

506
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,440
- Does that freak you out?
- Nah.

507
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,840
- D'you believe in hell?
- Aye.

508
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
- So, d'you believe in the devil?
- Aye.

509
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,600
What d'you think 'e looks like?

510
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,200
Looks like that, doesn' 'e?

511
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,520
What, a little nudist homunculus
with a pink quiff?

512
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
No, 'e looks like a snake

513
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
Let's 'ave a look at that

514
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,760
It's Archie, isn't it?

515
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,000
It's my good-luck charm

516
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,200
'As he brought you much?

517
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,360
Has it fuck.

518
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,120
- Are you superstituous?
- No

519
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,800
What d'you wear a good-luck
charm for, then?

520
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,960
Are we gonna get something
to eat or what?

521
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,920
Have you ever seen a dead body?

522
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,840
Only me own.

523
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,040
Where was you thinkin' to sleepin'
tonight?

524
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,960
Dunno.

525
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,920
Where did you kip down last night?

526
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,840
In the park.

527
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,240
- Was that not cold?
- Aye.

528
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,120
Where are you thinkin' of sleepin',
like?

529
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
Wherever I drop.

530
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,440
'Ow old are you, love?

531
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,880
Twenty-three

532
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,880
- Do your mam and dad know you're down 'ere?
- No.

533
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,680
- Will they not be worried about you?
- No

534
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
How old are you, like?

535
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
'Ow old d'you think I am?

536
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,840
About forty.

537
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,520
I'm twenty-seven.

538
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,960
Oh, get to fuck!

539
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,360
Where the fuck 'a you been?

540
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,800
Where the fuck 'a you been?
I've been waitin' on yer!

541
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,320
- Fuck off!
- Cunt!

542
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,480
Why the fuck you've been doin', eh?

543
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,880
You've got all the money.

544
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,200
I've been fuckin'g lookin'
all over for yer.

545
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Aye, well, I was wi' him!

546
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,840

547
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,000
- I was fuckin' wi' him!
- I was fuckin' wi' him!

548
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,160
Daft cunt!

549
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,800
- Fuckin' ask him!
- Fuck off!

550
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Fuckin' ask him!

551
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,800
- Fuckin' daft bitch!
- Where's my chips?

552
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,160
That was fuckin' years ago.

553
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,160
Aye, well, I was starvin' wasn't I?

554
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,400
- I'll fuckin' gi' yer fuckin' chips!
- Fuck off!

555
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,480
- Fuckin' leave us alone!

556
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,000
- Kick your fuckin' cunt

557
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,800
Did he 'urt you?

558
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,600
What d'you mean?

559
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,000
You know, when you were fuckin'?

560
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,480
Why? Did he 'urt you?

561
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,320
D'you thing you were made
for each other?

562
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,800
Well, we went out for a year.

563
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,320
A year?! Fuckin''ell - gimme a year!

564
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,920
D'you ever feel like topping
yourself?

565
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,560
Oh, God! I wish I was at 'ome

566
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,000
Glad I'm not.

567
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,600
Yeah, well, I don't mean with me mum and dad.
I just mean in Manchester.

568
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
Oh, you reckon it's different there, do you?

569
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,720
- Yeah - people talk to you.
- Well, I'm talkin' to you.

570
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,600
Yeah, but you talk a pile of shit.

571
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,240
Don't matter where are you, anyway.

572
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,920
You might as well be in
Zimbabwe with Sandra.

573
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,000
Are you gonna do any washin'
up before she gets back?

574
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, course I am.
When is she gettin' back?

575
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Sunday.

576
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,760
Well, that's four fuckin' days away,
innit?

577
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,040
"Thou shalt not consent unto Him,
nor harken unto Him."

578
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,520
"Neither shall thine eye pity Him,
neither shalt thou spare",

579
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,720
"neither shalt thou conceal 'Im.
But thou shalt surely kill 'Im. Thy ha..."

580
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,960
Lost me place now.

581
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,640
"And thou shalt stone 'Im with stones,
that He die

582
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,640
because He hath sought to thrust thee
away from the Lord thy God. And -"

583
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,160
Oh, fuckin' 'ell! Why 'ast though
forsaken me? Bastard!"

584
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,840
Is that it now, then? Are you through
with the regulation pacin'?

585
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,040
You're all set to deploy the fatuous
sarcasm?

586
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,080
Well, I've beaten you to it.

587
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Would you like a mint?

588
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
Oh, what's this, new policy?
Ply the culprit with menthol?

589
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,600
Extra strong.

590
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
I get four packets of these a night

591
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,680
You want be careful, don't yer?
I don't want your poxy mint.

592
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,600
Oh? Waste not, want not.

593
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,440
And other cliches.

594
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,360
Ah - but a cliche is full of truth,
otherwise it wouldn't be a cliche.

595
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,120
Which is in itself a cliche.

596
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,600
Tell me, have you

597
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,560
read the book of Hosea?

598
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,360
What now?

599
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,240
"For they are the children of whores".

600
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
There's no need to get personal, mate.

601
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,200
Look, will you stop fucking about?

602
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,920
If you're gonna stick the boot in,
will you get on with it?

603
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,080
Have you got nowhere to go, then?

604
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,160
Yeah, I've got an infinite number
of fuckin' places to go.

605
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,960
The problem is, where you stay.

606
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,040
Are you with me?

607
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,880
Indeed. Yes.

608
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,560
So listen, is there much security

609
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,440
in this job?

610
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,000
Too much.

611
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,160
And what is it what goes on in this
particular postmodernist gas chamber?

612
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,720
Nothing. It's empty.

613
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,840
So what is it that you're guardin'?

614
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,440
Space.

615
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,920
You're guarding space?

616
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,400
That's stupid, innit? Because someone
could break in there, right,
and steal all the fuckin' space,

617
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,800
and you wouldn't know it 'ad gone,
would you?

618
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,840
Good point.

619
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,040
Night-night.

620
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,560
Yeah, all right, pal.
I appreciate you've got a job to do,
an' it's "Move on! Move on! Move on!"

621
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,480
But it's fuckin' freezin' out there,
an' I was a Caesarian.

622
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,480
Come on, quick!

623
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,480
- What?
- Come in.

624
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,800
Are you serious?

625
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,440
Through that door... smartish.

626
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,080
It's a funny smell in 'ere.

627
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,200
Come on.

628
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,280
A bit of waste of space, all this,
in't it?

629
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,440
You could sleep a thousand flea-bitten
tramps in 'ere.

630
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,520
And what's all that?

631
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,880
You know, they say it's a fuckin'
jungle out there? 'Ave you seen it in 'ere?

632
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,640
I mean, where's the bloody monkeys?

633
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,640
Look, Dad, will you just back off?!
What is it you're after?

634
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,800
- You must be invisible.
- What?

635
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,840
I must be seen.

636
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,240
Follow me.

637
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
Sit here.

638
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,120
Am I allowed to smoke in here?

639
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,280
No. You'll set off the alarm.

640
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,880
Now, I'm not gonna look at you.

641
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,200
It mustn't look like I'm talking
to anybody.

642
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,280
If you're seen in here,
I'm out of a job.

643
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,600
See what I mean?

644
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,120
Well, if they see you talking to yourself
like that, you'll be out of a job anyway.

645
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,880
They'll come after you with
a big butterfly net.

646
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,560
Oh, yes.. I'll stand like this, then.

647
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,320
Well, that's better, isn't it?

648
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,280
What?

649
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,240
In out of the cold?

650
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,720
Yeah. Yeah - thanks very much.

651
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,240
It's funny bein' inside, in't it?

652
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,320
'Cos when you are inside, you're
still actually outside, aren't you?

653
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,760
And then you can say when you're
outside, you're inside,

654
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,640
because you're always inside your head.

655
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,000
D'you follow that?

656
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,320
Yes. Sometimes when I'm sitting here,
I turn the lights off -

657
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,480
sit in the dark.

658
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,520
That always makes me feel like
I'm sitting

659
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,560
outside.

660
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,800
So what d'you do with you self
here of a night-time?

661
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,520
I read. And I think.

662
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,560
What do you think about?

663
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,520
I think about my life.

664
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,200
- And is that horrendous for you?
- No! Certainly not!

665
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
Is it horrendous for your wife?

666
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,200
Are you married, mate?

667
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,520
Well, technically I'm married.

668
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,000
Although my wife is 5,919 miles away,

669
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,680
and I haven't seen her for
thirteen years.

670
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,240
It's all going very well then.
Where is she?

671
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,360
She's in Bangkok.

672
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,600
Saucy!

673
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,240
- They're not worth it, are they?
- Whores and harlots.

674
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,800
When was the last time you 'ad a fuck?

675
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,200
Is that an embarassin' question for you?

676
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,160
It is rather - yes.

677
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
I'm sorry.

678
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,320
Step this way.

679
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,800
I want to reveal to you
the mysteries of my trade.

680
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,160
What d'you think that is?

681
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,120
A Dadaist nun?

682
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,880
Wrong. This little lady is the
representative of my employer.

683
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,720
How d'you do, love?

684
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,520
Watch.

685
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,640
Very Zen.

686
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,400
My existence at this moment on this spot
is now trapped and recorded.

687
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,080
23 moments, 23 sites, every two hours.

688
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,160
That's my job.

689
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,760
Well, could they not train
a tall chimpanzee to do that?

690
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,400
Or, a small chimpanzee with
a bigger gizmo?

691
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,080
I suppose they could, yes.

692
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,560
What's your name, son?

693
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,680
- Brian.
- Hallo Brian - Johnny.

694
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,360
Well, Brian, congratulations,
you've succeeded in convincin' me

695
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,800
that you do 'ave the most
tedious fuckin' job in England.

696
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,320
Come on.

697
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,560
- Yes! It is a boring job!
Bloody boring, actually.
- All right! All right!

698
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,240
But all you can see is
the tip of the iceberg.

699
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,240
The present. The tedious here and now.

700
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,240
What you're not capable of seeing is
the rest of time - the rest of the iceberg.

701
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,120
The past and the future.

702
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,920
My future. Which is a very
interesting place to be.

703
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,760
And the good thing about this
job is that it gives me time and space

704
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,440
to contemplate the future at my leisure.

705
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,120
Whilst the city sleeps.

706
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,800
Free from cacophonous curiosity
of the hoi polloi.

707
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
So you see, it's not a boring job.

708
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,120
And I'm not boring, either.

709
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,480
Am I allowed to smoke on the stairs?

710
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,360
No. There's alarms all
over the building.

711
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,200
So you think you can make the present
palatable by projectin' into the future?

712
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,400
You're living in the past, pal.
It's the future that fucks you up, Brian.

713
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,480
It's the maggot in the apple.

714
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,480
See, you're all pissed off with the present, Bri,
and there's nothing wrong with the present.

715
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,120
The present's fine. The present's perfect.

716
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,520
The present's peachy-fuckin'-creamy.

717
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,880
The only thing wrong with the present
is the bastard doesn't exist,

718
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,800
Because the present is the future,
and the future is the past.

719
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,840
And it's all the same fuckin'
bag of bones anyway.

720
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,800
It's a constant process of comin' 
into bein' and passin' away,
comin' into bein' and passin' away.

721
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,320
The future is now.

722
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,400
But the present does exist.
We're in it, now.

723
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,480
You were just then when you said it,
but you're not in it now, you're not in it now,
you're not in it now. You're forever being kicked up

724
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,360
the arse by the future. Are you with me?

725
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,920
That's what I mean.
See, I'm in the present.

726
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,400
But I'm not in the present.
I'm in the future.

727
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,440
Exactly.

728
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,520
Has nobody not told you, Brian,

729
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,200
that you've got this kind of gleeful
preoccupation with the future?

730
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,280
I wouldn't even mind, but you
don't even 'ave a fuckin' future.

731
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,880
I don't 'ave a future. Nobody 'as
a future. The party's is over.

732
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,960
Take a look around you, man.
It's all breaking up.

733
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,960
Are you not familiar with the book
of Revelation of St John,

734
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,000
the final book of the Bible,
prophesying the Apocalypse?

735
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,160
Yes. As it happens, I'm familiar
with all the books of the Bible.

736
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,400
I'm very happy for you

737
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,520
"He forced everyone to receive a mark
on his right hand, or on his forehead,

738
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,760
so that no one shall be able
to buy or sell,

739
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,960
unless he has the mark, which is
the name of the beast.

740
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,720
Or the number of his name; and
the number of the beast is six-six-six.

741
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,040
- Six-six-six. I know about it
- Great!

742
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,400
I know about Nostradamus.
Nostradamus talked about three brothers.

743
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,240
Now, did he mean the Kennedy brothers,
or was he talking about three bits
of the Soviet Union?

744
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,640
You see, you just can't tell.

745
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,040
Fuck Nostradamus!
I'm not talking about Nostradamus

746
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,240
or Mother Shipton or Russell Grant
of Mystic fuckin' Meg -

747
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,160
I'm talking about a Holy fuckin' Book!

748
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,200
What can such a specific prophecy mean?

749
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,120
What is the mark?

750
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,400
Well the mark, Brian, is the bar code,

751
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,200
the ubiquitous barcode that you'll find
on every bog-roll, on every packet of johnnies,

752
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,720
and every poxy pork pie.

753
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,480
And every fuckin' bar code is divided
into two parts by three markers.

754
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,680
And those three markers are always
represented by the number six.

755
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,880
Six. Six. Six!

756
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,480
Now what does it say? "No one shall
be able to buy,

757
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,480
or sell, without that mark."

758
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,760
And now, what they're plannin' to do in
order to eradicate all credit-card fraud,

759
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,640
and in order to precipitate
a totally cashless society,

760
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,400
what they're plannin' to do, what they've
already tested on the American troops,

761
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,120
they're going to subcutaneously
laser-tattoo that mark

762
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,120
on to your right hand or on to
your forehead.

763
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,960
They're going to replace plastic
with flesh. Fact!

764
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,400
In the same book of Revelation, when the seven
seals are broken open on the Day of Judgement,

765
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,000
and the seven angels blow the trumpets,
when the third angel blows 'er bugle,

766
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,400
"Wormwood will fall from the sky.

767
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,360
Wormwood will poison a third part
of all the waters,

768
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,160
and a third part of all the land,
and many, many, many, people will die."

769
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,360
Now, d'you know what the Russian 
translation for "wormwood" is?

770
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,480
- No
- Chernobyl.

771
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,760
Fact!

772
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,800
On August the 18th, 1999,

773
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,400
the planets of our solar system
are going to line up into the
shape of a cross.

774
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,360
I don't believe in astrology.

775
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,920
I'm not talking about astrology.
I'm talking about astromony.

776
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,760
They're going to line up in the
fixed signs of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus,

777
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and Scorpio, which just happen to correspond
with the four beasts of the Apocalypse,

778
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,520
as mentioned in the Book of Daniel.

779
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,520
Another fuckin' fact!
D'you want me to go on?

780
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,120
The end of the world is nigh, Bri.
The game is up!

781
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,440
I don't believe that.

782
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,440
Life can't just come to a stop.

783
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,200
All right, I'm not sayin' that life
will end, or the world will end,

784
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
or the universe will cease to exist.

785
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,320
But Man will cease to exist.

786
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,680
Just like the dinosaurs passed into
extinction, the same thing'll happen to us.

787
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,120
We're not fuckin' important.
We're just a crap idea!

788
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,920
I'm not gonna cease to exist.

789
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,160
I'm gonna be here in the future.

790
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,920
What is this fuckin' fixation
with the future?!

791
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,400
Listen pal, I've got chronic
systolic palpitations

792
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,080
and acute fuckin' neuralgia!

793
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,960
What about these toilets -
can I smoke in 'ere?

794
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,160
No, you fuckin' can't!

795
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,040
Let me ask you a question.

796
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,080
Have you ever had the sense that you've
lived in a time different from this one?

797
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,360
- What you mean like in a past life?
- Could be, yeah.

798
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,880
Yeah, well, in my past life I was dead.

799
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,240
Ah, well, you see - I wasn't.

800
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,920
I know I was here in the past,
before I was born.

801
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,520
So I know I'm gonna be here 
in the future after I've died.

802
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,520
I see.

803
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,680
And in this alternative existence,

804
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,720
did you still 'ave the same noxious
body odour?

805
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,800
There's no need to be personal.
It's what I believe.

806
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,000
Shall I tell you what I believe?

807
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,880
You don't believe anything.

808
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,840
Oh, I do, Brian.

809
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,080
Yeah? What do you believe?

810
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,640
Do you think the amoeba ever dreamed
that it would evolve into the frog?

811
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Of course it didn't.

812
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,680
And when that first frog shimmied out of
the water and employed it's vocal chords

813
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,360
in order to attract a mate or
to retard a predator,

814
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,480
do you think that that frog ever imagined
that that incipient croak would evolve into

815
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,200
all the languages of the world,

816
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,400
into all the literature of the world?

817
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,840
'Course it fuckin' didn't.

818
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,080
And just as that froggy could never
have possibly conceived of - of Shakespeare,

819
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,680
we can never possibly imagine
our destiny.

820
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,040
I know what my destiny is.

821
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,600
Yeah but what you're experiencing,
as far as I can gather what with
all these manifestations of

822
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,720
regression and precognition

823
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,400
and transmigratory astral fuckin'
chatterin's,

824
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,800
is just the equivalent of that
first primeval grunt.

825
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,800
Because evolution isn't over.

826
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,880
Man isn't the fuckin' be-all and
fuckin' end-all.

827
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,080
Look. If you take the whole of time
represented by one year,

828
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,680
we're only in the first few moments
of the 1st of January.

829
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,320
There's a long way to go.

830
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,280
Only now we're not going to sprout
extra limbs and wings and fins

831
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,600
because evolution itself is evolving.

832
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,600
And whereas you, through some
process of extra-sensory recall,

833
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,240
might imagine that you were some -

834
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,720
I dunno, some 17th century little Dutch
girl livin' in a windmill in Old Amsterdam,

835
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,600
one day you'll realize that you've
had not just one or two

836
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,280
past or future existences,

837
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,840
but that you were, and are, everybody
and everything that 'as ever been,

838
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,520
or will ever be.

839
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,200
Hang on a minute. You've just
contradicted yourself.

840
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,320
Oh, and 'ow'd you make that out?

841
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,280
Downstairs you were predicting
the end of the world.

842
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,520
Now you're talking about the future.

843
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,200
How do you explain that, eh?

844
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,320
Easy.

845
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,200
When it comes, the Apocalypse itself

846
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,640
will be part of the process of
that leap of evolution.

847
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,440
Yeah, well, whatever happens,
mankind will not cease to exist.

848
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,040
He must. By the very definition of
Apocalypse, Mankind must cease to exist,

849
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,680
at least in a material form.

850
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,640
What d'you mean, in a material form?

851
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,840
Well, 'e'll evolve.

852
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,720
What into?

853
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,920
Into something that transcends matter.

854
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,040
Into a species of pure thought.
Are you with me?

855
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,280
Yeah. Like a ghost.

856
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,000
No, not like a fuckin' ghost,
you big girl's blouse!

857
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,680
Into something that's, like,
well beyond our comprehension.

858
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,400
Into a universal consciousness,

859
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,920
Into God. Who is.

860
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,080
By the same principle that time is.

861
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,320
You don't believe in God.

862
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,000
'Course I believe in God.

863
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,000
You see... The thing is, Brian

864
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,200
that God is a hateful God.

865
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,160
Must be, because if God is good,

866
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,240
then why is there evil in the world?

867
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,520
Why is there pain and hate and
greed and war?

868
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,720
It doesn't make sense.

869
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,640
But if God is a nasty bastard, then you
can say, why is there good in the world?

870
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,560
Why is there love and hope and joy?

871
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,280
Well, let's face it, good exists

872
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,480
in order to be fucked up by evil.

873
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,080
The very existence of good enables
evil to flourish.

874
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,800
Therefore, God is bad.

875
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,000
And it doesn't matter how many past
or future existences you have,

876
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,680
because they're all going to be
riddled with grief and anguish

877
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,480
and sickness and death.

878
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,760
You see Brian, God doesn't love you.

879
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,120
God despises you.

880
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,840
So there's no hope.

881
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,200
Mankind is just a component of
the device

882
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,160
by which the devil creates itself.

883
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:02,800
You with me?

884
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,200
You see, what I'm saying, basically,
is you can't make an omelette without
crackin' a few eggs,

885
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,800
and humanity is just a cracked egg.
And the omelette

886
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,200
stinks.

887
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,120
Yeah.

888
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,280
Oh. And what's through the round window?

889
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,160
'Oo's that?

890
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,720
Good question.

891
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,960
'Ave you seen 'er before?

892
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,200
Oh yeah. She's there every night.

893
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,040
Good-looking young girl, in't she?

894
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,800
She's all right.

895
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,640
Does she ever 'as fellers up there?

896
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,120
No.

897
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,800
'Ave you ever seen 'er, like,
you know, totally naked?

898
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,720
Once.

899
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,200
What's she up to, eh?

900
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,320
I mean, what's her game, taunting people
in the middle of the night, eh?

901
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,600
She probably gets a kick out of it.
Like you get a kick out o' watching 'er.

902
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,760
I'm doing no such thing.

903
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,680
Well, I am.

904
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,880
'Ave your got a 'ard-on?

905
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,520
No, I haven't, as a matter of fact.

906
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,000
You wouldn't tell me if you had,
would you?

907
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,640
No, I don't think I would.

908
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,240
- Did you make these youself?
- I did, yeah.

909
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,440
I thought so.

910
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,280
Well, listen, I might be back
in a couple of minutes.

911
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,200
Be good. If you can't be good,
be careful!

912
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,560
And other cliches.

913
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,320
Tatty-bye, Bri.

914
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Charles !

915
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,400
What?!

916
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,000
Mais il est ou alors? Ecoute,
je ne sais pas qui vous etes.

917
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,160
What's the fuck's going on?
Where the bloody hell's Dorfman,

918
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,360
the bastard costs me 30 grands already!

919
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,000
Quoi?!

920
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,320
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

921
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,800
Fuck !

922
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,560
Sorry about that.

923
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,600
Oh, I'm sorry, love. That's not you
on the top floor, is it?

924
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,800
- Dancin'?
- Yeah. Why?

925
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh, right. You're a lovely mover.

926
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,240
I'm sorry pet. I'm freaking you out.

927
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,120
Where's Bhapu?

928
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,520
Bhapu?

929
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,120
It's cold.

930
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,640
Listen, I'd better explain myself -
you see me brother's working

931
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,760
as an insecurity guard in that
fuckin' monstrosity round the back,

932
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,520
and we can see straight into your room.

933
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,480
It's very nice.

934
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,440
Anyway, 'e's got 'is boss comin' round.
So 'e's told me to schlep round the streets

935
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,560
for a couple of hours, and I said

936
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,480
I'd come and say 'ello to Isadora Duncan.
Keep you company.

937
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,120
I know it's a big cheeky but
I'm a cheeky young monkey!

938
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,520
D'you wanna come in?

939
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,280
Is that all right?

940
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,040
How long you been growing that?

941
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,280
About two inches.

942
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,720
It's nice.

943
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,360
You've 'ad a few, an't you, love?

944
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,480
Do you wanna come in?

945
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,880
Thought you'd never ask.

946
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,000
Am I allowed to smoke in 'ere?

947
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,680
Thank Christ for that!

948
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,520
D'you wanna a drink?

949
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,880
I think I better 'ad, don't you? Got a bit
of fuckin' catchin' up to do, an't I?

950
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,840
Here's to the monarchy!

951
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,000
- What's funny?
- I'm not laughing.

952
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,920
So, do you live 'ere on yer own, yeah?

953
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,640
Is this what you're reading?
"Jane Austen" by Emma.

954
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,960
It's my favorite book.

955
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,000
Is it really?

956
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,840
I don't read much, meself.

957
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:56,920
You're from Ireland?

958
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,240
No.

959
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,800
Why?

960
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,000
What's that, a damp patch?

961
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,800
Oh, I never noticed that before.

962
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,440
'Ow's it goin' inside there?

963
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,800
Baby.

964
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,320
'Ow old are you, love?

965
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,360
It's funny, 'cos from over there
you look a lot younger.

966
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,920
I think me big brother's quite 
taken with you.

967
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,040
'E's up there every night, 'avin'
a bit of a wank about yer.

968
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,720
Are you with me?

969
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,640
What's the matter?

970
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,440
Don't do that

971
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,640
What, that?

972
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Or that?

973
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,680
Don't you like that?

974
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,240
You don't 'ave to 'urt me

975
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,480
I'm sorry

976
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,720
Bite me.

977
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,280
Fuckin' bite me!

978
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,840
Come on!

979
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,520
'Oo's this?

980
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,920
'Oo's this?

981
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,560
I can't, love.

982
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,920
You look like me mother.

983
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,920
D'you think you can recapture your
youth by fuckin' it?

984
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,160
You don't want to fuck me - you'll
catch something cruel.

985
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,920
Bonjour

986
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,320
What's goin' on?
What're you doin' 'ere?

987
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,560
Well, you see. I was over 'ere,
like this,

988
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,160
but that didn't work for me,
so I thought

989
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,280
I'd try over here, but I don't think
there's much future in this one either.

990
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,240
Fuckin' 'ell! Have you got any
suggestions?

991
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,720
So what do you do now?

992
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,880
I'm gonna get some breakfast

993
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,200
I could do somethin' to eat
Can I come with yer?

994
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,440
Well, have you got any money?

995
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:13,840
No

996
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,080
How you're gonna pay for it?

997
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,280
I'm not

998
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,240
Well, I'm hungry

999
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,840
Did you have to go and beat her up?

1000
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,440
I never beat 'er up

1001
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,360
You shagged her, though?

1002
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,480
No

1003
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,160
You don't believe me, do you?

1004
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,840
She's older than you

1005
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,400
Bollocks

1006
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,640
Poached egg.

1007
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,800
That skirt's a bit short, innit, love?.
'T's disgraceful

1008
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,640
What's this?

1009
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,840
That's where I'm gonna live

1010
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,320
Where is it?

1011
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,040
Ireland

1012
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,480
I've lived in a cottage before

1013
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,640
What, in one of your past lives?

1014
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,840
Yes, as a matter of fact

1015
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,640
Fuckin' shit-hole, innit?

1016
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,960
Don't waste your life

1017
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,200
What?

1018
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,520
Don't waste your life

1019
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,040
What time does this place close?

1020
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,120
Four o'clock

1021
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,720
Listen, can you tell where I can
get somethin' to eat round here?

1022
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:54,760
What?

1023
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,520
- You've got a very nice smile
- 'Ave I?

1024
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,520
Oh, yeah.

1025
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Sorry, sir

1026
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,120
I'll take that, sir.

1027
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,760
Your lady companion's joinin' you, sir?

1028
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,600
No, - she can't make it today, pal,
the old sciatica's

1029
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,480
playin' up an' everything, you know?

1030
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:07,840
Come on

1031
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:09,880
What?

1032
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,960
Out the car

1033
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,720
But I've only just got in the car.

1034
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,440
Get out of the fuckin' car!!!

1035
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,880
All right Parker, keep your 'air on.

1036
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,160
Well, that was lovely.

1037
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,560
Thank you

1038
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,840
Keep in touch

1039
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,480
Ooh, fuck

1040
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,720
'Oo are you?

1041
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,520
Sebastian Hawks.

1042
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,080
Nice to meet you

1043
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,320
Yeah, er, what're you doin' 'ere?

1044
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,280
I'm an acquaintance of Sandra's

1045
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,320
I've just popped round to say hallo

1046
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,360
Well, Sandra's away at the moment,
actually

1047
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,880
Really?
I hope you don't mind,

1048
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,120
but I helped myself to a beer

1049
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,720
Yeah, I noticed. Is that your
champagne an' all?

1050
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,040
You like champagne, do you?

1051
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,840
Yeah. I do, as it 'appens.

1052
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,360
This is a very nice flat,
don't you think?

1053
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,320
'Ow'd you get in 'ere?

1054
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,520
Tell me, d'you have any problems
with the central heating?

1055
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,040
Oh, are you the plumber?

1056
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,160
Let's just say I've got a vested
interest in the property

1057
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,800
Fuckin' 'ell, you're the landlord.

1058
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,840
I'd rather you thought of me as a friend

1059
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,240
Oh shit!

1060
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,240
What, is Sandra behind on
the rent or somethin'?

1061
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,520
Was your tattoo painful?

1062
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,720
Yeah

1063
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,440
Good

1064
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,440
You're very beautiful, aren't you?

1065
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,440
Am I?

1066
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,920
In a quirky sort of way.

1067
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,680
Are you a nurse?

1068
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,560
Yeah. Psychiatric.

1069
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,840
These are a very fetching pair of tights

1070
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,600
Ah, you like them, do yer, Mr Landlord?

1071
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,440
Can we 'ave that champagne now, please?

1072
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,440
Did you buy them

1073
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,160
like this or are the holes
self-inflicted?

1074
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,840
No. A spider spun them, and that's
where he 'ad a tea-break.

1075
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,640
Fuckin' 'ell! That's a bit excessive,
innit?

1076
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,440
I rather like this belt too

1077
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,440
Oh, God! 'Ere we go.

1078
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,480
Excuse me, where d'you think 
you're going?

1079
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,360
I'm goin' home

1080
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,600
What, are you leavin' me?

1081
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,240
I've come all this way to see you
and you're goin'! I can't believe it,

1082
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,040
I'm stunned, I'm flabbergasted.

1083
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,640
Shall we get you a tissue?

1084
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,640
Sounds promisin'. Do you live nearby?

1085
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,720
I might do.

1086
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,760
I mean, is it within walking distance?

1087
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,240
No, 'cause you see, I've got this
fascination with all things peripatetic.

1088
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,280
See you!

1089
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,280
I'm cheeky, aren't I?

1090
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,080
Have you stolen the teacosy?
Love, people can see you wearin'
that thing,

1091
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,120
are you not embarassed? No?

1092
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,720
Don't give up

1093
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,360
Put this on!

1094
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,040
Oh, what? We're gonna play doctors
and nurses now, are we?

1095
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,240
Hurry up!

1096
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,240
Oh, this is ridiculous.

1097
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,560
Listen, I'm really sorry, right?

1098
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,680
But I've had a bit of a rough week,

1099
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,360
and I just don't think I can go
through with this

1100
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,360
Oh, no! No!

1101
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,360
Fuck off! leave me alove! No!

1102
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,360
You fuckin' bastard!!

1103
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,720
D'you want some beans?

1104
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,240
Yeah, cheers.

1105
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,480
So, what would you be doin' now
if I wasn't 'ere?

1106
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,840
Dunno

1107
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,760
Having a shower, relaxin'

1108
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,680
I could do with a shower myself

1109
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,160
I haven't washed for about a week

1110
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,040
As you've probably noticed

1111
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,240
Well, you can 'ave one if you like

1112
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,040
Are you sure?

1113
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,040
Yeah. Bathroom's just here

1114
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,600
Fuckin' 'ell

1115
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,840
What did I do to deserve you, love?

1116
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,400
Just press this button

1117
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,840
Now listen

1118
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,880
You're not going to creep up on me with
a big knife dressed up as your mother, are you?

1119
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,320
No.

1120
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,680
Although it looks like you already are
dressed up as your mother

1121
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,280
Can I have me bag?

1122
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,040
It's got me duck in it.

1123
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,680
Ta

1124
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,640
Oh dear

1125
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,280
'Oo lives 'ere, then? Zeus?

1126
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,040
Is all this stuff yours?

1127
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:37,680
No.

1128
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,760
All these pseudo-Doric midgets

1129
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,440
with their novelty underpants

1130
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,160
Oh, look at this one, touchin'
time with a bargepole

1131
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,800
I wouldn't

1132
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,160
Is 'e a home-owner-sexual, yeah?

1133
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,040
What do you think?

1134
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,840
Where is 'e?

1135
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,080
They're in America

1136
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,320
They?

1137
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,520
Yeah.

1138
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,840
When are they gettin' back?

1139
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,920
Dunno

1140
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,960
And they're just letting you stop 'ere,
for nothin, yeah?

1141
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,160
Yeah. I don't know them

1142
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,240
I don't know, I find this all a bit sad

1143
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,200
Why?

1144
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,280
No, I don't mean that to sound homophobic

1145
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,280
I mean, I like The Iliad

1146
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,240
and The Odyssey. D'you get that?

1147
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,240
No

1148
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,120
So, 'ave you read many of these books?

1149
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,240
No, I haven't.

1150
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,400
Oh, I've read quite a few

1151
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,200
Oh, look!

1152
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,640
D'you get it now?

1153
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,880
D'you know this?

1154
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,680
I bet you do. You've most likely
done it at school

1155
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,840
You just can't remember

1156
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,720
You know, like, Achilles' heel

1157
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,360
the Wooden Horse, Helen of Troy.
You know them?

1158
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:50,840
Yeah.

1159
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,240
yeah, well, that's all it is.

1160
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,760
Good stuff. Cyclops.

1161
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:56,840
Oh, hallo,

1162
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,760

1163
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,440
D'you want those beans?

1164
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,040
Oh, yeah, I forgot

1165
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,040
Sebastian Hawks. Good evening.

1166
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,120
Very nice to meet you, Louise.

1167
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,240
Oh, very nice to meet you

01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,640

We've had a very interesting afternoon,

1173
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,120
It's been fascinatin'!

1174
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,000
For services rendered

1175
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,120
Fuck off!

1176
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,840

Well, d'you wanna cup o'tea?

1194
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,720
Any chance of a coffee, Louise?

1195
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,480
Yeah, sure

1196
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,320
These are a very nice pair of shorts

1197
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,440
Would you take your 'ands off me,
please?

1198
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,680
I apologise

1199
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,520
Right, pal. 'Ere's your clothes,
get your kit on and sling yer 'ook.

1200
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,760
'Ere's your shoes, mate

1201
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,040
Hope I haven't given you AIDS,
Sophie.

1202
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,800
- Jesus Christ
- Fuckin' 'ell!! Are you serious?

1203
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,680
Merely jesting.

1204
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,760
Very funny.

1205
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,160
Mind you, I think AIDS is rather
healthy in its way.

1206
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,200
You what?

1207
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,280
I realize that's not the fashionable
thing to say, of course.

1208
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,400
No. It's not.

1209
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,080
But the world is overcrowded, isn't it?
It could do with a bit of pruning.

1210
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,000
Fuckin' better be jokin'.

1211
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,200
You're not going to have children,
are you, Louise?

1212
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,120
I might do, one day.

1213
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,040
I loathe children, I must say

1214
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,920
I bet they're not too keen on you,
neither

1215
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,960
- I'm sure you like fucking, don't you,
Louise? - Are you goin'?

1216
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,280
I'm rather enjoying myself, actually

1217
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,240
- Well, we're not
- That's a pity

1218
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:24,600
Look, you may be the landlord from hell,
but that doesn't give you the right
to lie on our couch

1219
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:26,720
Whose couch?

1220
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,320
D'you want me to phone the police?

1221
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,520
Be my guest

1222
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,840
Right

1223
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,680
- Listen, I can't 'ave them in 'ere?
- Why not?

1224
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,160
They gonna take one look at 'im in
'is suit and one look at us

1225
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,560
and 'oo d'you think they're
gonna believe?

1226
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,760
There's fuckin' dope all over the place

1227
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,240
Well, we're just windin' him up -
'e's loving this.

1228
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,160
What are we gonna do?

1229
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,960
It's very peaceful in 'ere, isn't it?

1230
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,040
I suppose so

1231
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,440
Are you warm enough?

1232
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,080
Yeah, this is nice - thanks

1233
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,440
It's funny, 'cos the silence
usually freaks me out

1234
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,240
You start to pick up on all
the small sounds,

1235
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,640
you know what I mean? Like that clock

1236
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,680
I hate that fuckin' clock

1237
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,360
Of course you do - it's a clock

1238
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,920
Is it all right if I stay here

1239
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,160
tonight?

1240
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,680
'Ve you ever 'ad

1241
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,640
a dog?

1242
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:38,960
No.

1243
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,640
I don't like dogs

1244
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,120
Why?

1245
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,560
Well, they're either vicious or daft

1246
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,040
- Why, 'ave you?
- Yeah

1247
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,320
Is it dead now?

1248
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,280
Yeah.

1249
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,200
Did you bury it?

1250
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,880
I dunno, me dad took it

1251
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,920
And what about you? Would you like
to be buried or cremated?

1252
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,240
I couldn't give a shit

1253
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,920
I 'ad this dream the other night,
about these two skeletons 'aving a fuck.

1254
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,240
It was a right bloody racket -
woke me up.

1255
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,680
'Ave you got a photo of your mum?

1256
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,320
What, on me?

1257
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,600
Yeah

1258
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:28,320
No

1259
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,480
But I think you might find one over
at the newsagent's, on the top shelf

1260
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,840
D'you want some beans?

1261
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,360
You've got a very sad face

1262
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,480
'Ave I?

1263
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,440
It's all right, I mean,

1264
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,000
I find that attractive

1265
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,800
But that's me

1266
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,720
So, 'ave you got a boyfriend
or anythin'?

1267
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,400
What are gonna do for Christmas?

1268
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,400
I don't know. What're you gonna do?

1269
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,120
You all right?

1270
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,720
What's the matter?

1271
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,000
Fuck off!

1272
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,840
What's up love?

1273
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,360
Was it something I said?

1274
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,640
I want you to go

1275
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:00,880
Why?

1276
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,440
Can you go, please?!

1277
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,720
Is it 'cos I don't like dogs?

1278
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,520
Get out!!

1279
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,920
I don't quite follow, love

1280
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,480
Just fuck off!!

1281
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,000
Oh, I see

1282
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,240
Well, perhaps I was jumpin' to conclusions,
but I got the impression I could kip down
on the sofa or somethin'

1283
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,040
- Go!
- Go where?

1284
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,520
'Ave you got any suggestions?
'Cos it's like

1285
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,600
a fuckin' Eskimo's grave out there.

1286
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,720
All right, I'm going

1287
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,920
It's not easy, is it?

1288
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,240
D'you find that?

1289
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,840
Well, just goes to show you

1290
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,640
that no matter how many books you read,

1291
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,920
there's some things in this world
that you never, ever, ever, ever,

1292
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,040
ever fuckin' understand.

1293
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,400
Thank you for the tea, and the bath,

1294
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,520
and the booze.

1295
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,440
And the beans.

1296
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,840
And listen love,

1297
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,880
I hope that when you're tucked
up tonight

1298
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,040
all snug and warm underneath your
tear-sodden fuckin' duvet

1299
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,360
and your ankle-length Emily Bronte
windin'-sheet

1300
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,320
that you spare a thought for me,
with my head in a puddle of
cold dog's piss,

1301
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,360
An' I hope that you dream about me.

1302
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,560
An' I hope that you wake up screaming.

1303
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,440
And I hope that all your
fuckin' children

1304
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,520
are born blind, bow-legged,
hare-lipped, homeless hunchbacks!!

1305
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,360
'Ave you ever 'ad an abortion?

1306
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,280
'Ave you?

1307
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,640
No. I thought I was pregnant once.

1308
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,240
Would you 'ave 'ad one?

1309
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,480
Will, In the end, it turned out
I wasn't, and 'e left me anyway, so...

1310
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,400
I wanted to keep mine

1311
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,040
What happened?

1312
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,400
All my mates said I couldn't look 
after a baby

1313
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,160
Too fuckin' right.

1314
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,840
Did it make you feel shitty?

1315
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,960
It was a nightmare.

1316
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,640
I really loved 'im

1317
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,640
'E was a philosopher

1318
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,000
Where was this?

1319
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,040
Paris.

1320
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,760
You should've seen the state of
'is girlfriend

1321
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,240
'Ad one when I was fifteen, an' all.

1322
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,840
Oh, Jesus, Sophie!

1323
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,440
I think that one was worse for my mum,

1324
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,600
fuckin' drama she made out of it

1325
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,480
I could've been married by now,
with a four-year-old

1326
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,760
D'you want to get married?

1327
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:56,960
Don't know

1328
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,960
Just 'cos you 'ave a kid with someone
doesn't mean they're gonna stick around.

1329
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,920
My dad didn't. 'E couldn't
fuckin' wait to get out.

1330
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,440
Well, don't know if I want
to get married,

1331
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,160
but I wouldn't say no to a proper
relationship

1332
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,040
What is a proper relationship?

1333
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,440
Livin' with someone 'oo talks
to you after they've bonked you.

1334
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,440
I don't know what they want
from you 'alf the time.

1335
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,240
What they start off liking you for

1336
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,120
they end up hatin' you for.

1337
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,800
Don't like you if you're strong,
don't like you if you're weak;

1338
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,320
hate you if you're clever,
hate you if you're stupid.

1339
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,040
They don't know what they want.

1340
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,840
D'you think that bastard's
fucked off yet?

1341
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,160
Yeah, he musta done by now.

1342
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,000
Is this a stick-up?

1343
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,240
- Sorry - you must get that
all the time, yeah? - Yeah

1344
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,640
Just got it again.

1345
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:38,320
So is this your job, or a nice
little hobby you've got for yourself?

1346
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,320
You're a lovely mover!

1347
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,440
- This your van, yeah?
- Yeah

1348
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,240
It's like, er, I dunno,
top o' the range.

1349
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,720
Very nice

1350
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,480
Are you goin' up the road?

1351
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,720
D'you wanna lift?

1352
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,080
Is that all right with you?

1353
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,800
Cheers

1354
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,440
It's just, I've been walkin' round the
streets all night, you know what I mean?

1355
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,240
These fuckin' feet are on their
last legs, I'm telling you.

1356
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,440
So, 'ow much d'you earn for doin' this?

1357
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,040
It's none of your fuckin' business

1358
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:21,240
I mean, is the pay as substantial
as say, the wages of sin?

1359
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,560
You know what I mean? Are you with me?

1360
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,480
Listen, Captain, is it all right
if I 'ave a go at doin' this, yeah?

1361
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,360
Oh! God love you!

1362
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,000
I mean, or does it take like
thousands of years of like

1363
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,360
state-subsidized government training
to do this clobber, yeah?

1364
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,560
You've gotta slap on like
copious quantities

1365
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,200
of the old industrial sputum there.

1366
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,200
Beg your puddin'

1367
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,600
It's a wonderful career
opportunity for me -

1368
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,040
you know what I mean? I'm not
gonna play the joker on this one.

1369
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,120
- Shift
- It's all goin' very well

1370
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,440
Shift out the fuckin' way, will you?

1371
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,160
No, I like Laurel and Hardy, you know,
although apparently they didn't
get on in real life,

1372
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,640
You know, another illusion shattered.

1373
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,120
Sorry about that pal, it's just
I've 'ad a lot of bad experience
with walls,

1374
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,640
you know, what with talking
to them and climbing them,

1375
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,080
and me dad's driven me up a good
few of them in 'is time,
you know what I mean?

1376
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,840
But I think I've got the secret.
The saucy little secret,

1377
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,040
this solipsistic, sagacious little
secret is just, you got - you just gotta

1378
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,040
bang your fuckin' head against them!

1379
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,160
Just crack the old pate.

1380
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,840
Are you with me?! 'Ave you got it?

1381
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,440
And that's it, that's the key to
enlightenment, which is,
it's like that's why,

1382
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:25,360
it's like such a potent motif
of civilization - it's the wall.

1383
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,840
It's like the, the Great Wall of China,
and the Wall of Jericho

1384
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,080
and the Berlin Wall, and the
Wailin' Wall

1385
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,400
Now you see the Jews, they've
almost got it, an't they?

1386
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,240
What with the old rockin' and that,
and you know, just that six inches away

1387
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,200
and they'd be there, they'd have won the
fuckin' race, they'll be there,
you with me?

1388
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,240
What is all this, anyway?
What are you doin'? Cancel everythin'.

1389
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,840
In the beginnin' there was the Word,
and the word was 'cancelled'

1390
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
D'you get like satisfaction out of this?
D'you think you're makin' a contribution?

1391
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,360
You're like sort of publicly
promulgatin' vacuities? Are you with me?

1392
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,440
Fuckin' hell!!

1393
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,040
Oh, that's it! Blank it all out!
Blank it all out

1394
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,720
till you just atrophy and die
of fuckin' indifference.

1395
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,920
Can I show you somethin', pal?
You see that at the top of your legs?

1396
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,240
That's your arse and that's your fuckin'
elbow! Do you want to write it down or s-

1397
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,960
'Oo's that supposed to be, me dad?

1398
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,520
You wanna watch that, mate -
I've got a dicky sacrum 'ere

1399
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,080
Shit!

1400
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,840
Can you come back here? Did I upset you?

1401
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:35,480
You've got me bag! You fuckin' tosser!!

1402
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:36,480
You f-

1403
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,120
Fuck!!

1404
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,600
Oh, listen!! Does anybody mind
if I scream 'ere?

1405
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,320
Is that OK with you all? 
'Cos I'd feel better

1406
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,040
for it - won't take long!

1407
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,640
Fuck

1408
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,600
'Os's that?

1409
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,800
Oh Jesus!

1410
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,880
What's been happenin' to you?

1411
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,280
Will you shut up, for God's sake?

1412
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1413
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,240
Just give us a fag

1414
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,640
Fuckin' comedian

1415
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,400
- It's not my fault
- What's not your fault?

1416
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,480
Where are you goin'?

1417
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,200
I just want to go to bed

1418
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,080
Be quiet!

1419
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,880
I fuckin' walked 'ere

1420
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,000
Where from?

1421
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:22,800
Johnny.

1422
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:27,640
I'm gonna be sick

1423
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,680
Fuckin' 'ell, what's 'appened to 'im?

1424
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:41,920
I dunno

1425
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,440
Johnny, are you all right, Johnny?

1426
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:44,840
Get off!

1427
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,640
Is 'e still 'ere?

1428
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,440
I dunno

1429
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,200
Right, we'd better get him into bed

1430
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,800
You take that end, I'll take this end

1431
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:29,920
OK, don't push me, right?

1432
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,440
I'm not pushin' you!

1433
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,480
Careful, that's 'is bad leg

1434
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,680
Well, what d'you want me to do?

1435
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,000
After three

1436
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,840
One, two, three

1437
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,840
I wanna go!

1438
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,320

1440
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:41,800
I'm not here yet. I'm still wet

1441
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:46,240
What did she mean?

1442
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,120
Why not me brother?

1443
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,040
Will it be quiet now?

1444
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,120
Are we goin'?

1445
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,520
Fuck!

1446
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,240
Who's this?

1447
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,440
It's all right, 'e's a friend of mine

1448
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,640
What extraordinary friends you have.
He's only got one sock on.

1449
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,760
Shut up!

1450
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,040
You seem a bit tense, Sophie.
Would you like a massage?

1451
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,280
Are you the doctor?

1452
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,200
Pardon?

1453
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,440
Is he the doctor?

1454
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,480
You're rather disgusting, aren't you?

1455
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,600
You're not crying, are you, Louise?

1456
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,840
Oh, listen, when are you
gonna fuck off?

1457
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,320
This 'as got nothin' to do with you,
right?

1458
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:54,720
No! No!

1459
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,680
Leave me alone!

1460
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,440
Fuckin' 'ell, me leg!

1461
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,320
You don't know

1462
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,040
Aren't people pathetic?

1463
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,960
Right. I'm going to beddy-byes.

1464
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,760
If anyone wishes to join me,
I'll be under the duvet

1465
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,240
Are you all right?

1466
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,440
Yeah. Are you?

1467
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,640
Yeah.

1468
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,760
Come on, I'll give you a hand.

1469
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:42,840
I'm all right, I walked 'ere.

1470
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,920
Is it 'ere?

1471
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:09,640
Yeah.

1472
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,160
'Oo's that?

1473
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:14,400
Clancy.

1474
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,320
I thought so.

1475
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:19,760
I used to know you, didn't I?

1476
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,360
Yeah.

1477
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,720
"Take me back to Manchester

1478
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,760
when it's raining.

1479
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:41,160
I want to wet me feet in Albert Square.

1480
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:47,240
I'm all agog
For a good, thick fog.

1481
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,640
I don't like the sun,

1482
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,000
I like it raining cats and dogs!

1483
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:58,840
I want to smell the odours
of the Irwell.

1484
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,400
I want to feel the soot get
in me 'air,

1485
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,440
Oh, I don't want to roam.

1486
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:10,640
I want to get back 'ome

1487
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,720
to rainy Manchester"

1488
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,200
I've got an 'ard-on.

1489
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:27,960
What's...?

1490
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,760
What are you...?

1491
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,280
This is...It's disgusting!

1492
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,680
Nobody, in my....

1493
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,240
Who's 'e?

1494
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,880
You've got your boots on! She's...

1495
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,600
And what's this doing?

1496
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:56,280
This is something I can't...
I don't....

1497
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,080
It's not...I just don't need
all this...palaver.

1498
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,440
Oh, shit!

1499
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,240
Ok, who's Jeremy ?

1500
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,840
- Who's Jeremy ?
- What you mean?

1501
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:25,320
Sandra! What a nice surprise!

1502
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,840
What are you doing here?

1503
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,080
How was Zimbabwe?

1504
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,520
Shift!

1505
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,600
Morning, Louise.

1506
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,640
- Where's Jeremy ?
- 'Oo's Jeremy ?

1507
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,080
These are Jeremy's

1508
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,480
That's Sebastian's.

1509
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,640
No, look. Jeremy Smart.
Jeremy Smart. Jeremy G. Smart.

1510
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,040
Well, I've never 'eard of him.

1511
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,640
Sebastian. Who -
Are you Jeremy G. Smart ?

1512
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,520
Are you?

01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,240

Just leave 'im

1515
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,440
Oh, for fuck's sake, Sophie,

1516
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,120
- What day is it?

1517
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,040
Fuck this

01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,520
Look at 'is eye

1519
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,320
Christ

1520
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,880
Well, he can lie down in my room -
oh, God!

1521
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,400
What're you doin'?
'E's not 'arming anyone

1522
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,840
'Ave you seen the state of 'er?

1523
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,760
- Johnny!
- I'm here, Johnny

1524
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:09,840
Morning, everyone

1525
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,280
I would, actually,
like to have some kind of

1526
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,640
explanation for all this, because...

1527
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,360
- Having fun?
- Can you put these on, please?

1528
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,640
Sophie and I had a fuck on your
bed yesterday afternoon, Sandra.

1529
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,280
- She was very good, I must say
- You are just...filth!
- Not as good as you, though

1530
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:27,360
You lying...nastiness!

1531
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,280
We must do it again sometime

1532
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,600
Will you...?

1533
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,880
How can you...?

1534
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,040
Everything!

1535
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,880
I can't cope with this

1536
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,800
You've got five minutes

1537
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:49,240
Five minutes to get your things
on and get the hell...

1538
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,640
I shouldn't worry about things
so much, if I were you

1539
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,760
I'd forgotten what a beautiful
bottom you've got, Sandra

1540
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,840
Two minutes

1541
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,040
Marvellous tits!

1542
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,640
Listen, Sandra, I'm really sorry.
We weren't expectin' you back.

1543
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,720
I fail to...why...

1544
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,040
It's a pigsty ... it's...

1545
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,560
I know - it just got out of hand

1546
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,760
Obviously. And what's all that?

1547
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,840
'E's a friend of mine -
Look, can I make you a cup o'tea?

1548
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,560
I don't want tea... I don't want...

1549
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,160
I just want...  My journey was...

1550
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:25,360
He's not very well!

1551
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:26,440
What's the matter with 'im?

1552
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,680
'E's got a lump on his face the size
of a boiled egg an' 'he won't wake up

1553
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,240
Did he do this?

1554
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,200
- 'Oo ?
- Sebastian - Jeremy?

1555
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:44,080
You never warned me about 'im, did you?

1556
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:45,040
What are you talking about?

1557
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,080
Fuckin' lettin' 'imself in
with the keys! Bastard!

1558
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,120
I don't...

1559
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:51,640
Right. Let's get

1560
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,680
this shoe off.

1561
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:57,320
Have you ever had smoked salmon
after making love, Louise?

1562
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,000
Don't like smoked salmon

1563
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:02,440
I think you should try it.
It's rather wonderful.

1564
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,720
Will you undo your flies, Sebastian?

1565
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,600
Would you like me to?

1566
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,080
Honest.

1567
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,960
Or d'you not want me to slice your prick
off and shove it up your arse?

1568
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,200
Maggot dick!

1569
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,560
Could you pass me that pillow,
please?

1570
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,240
- I can't move, Sandra
- Here you go

1571
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,760
You are worse than useless

1572
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,320
Ooh, are y'all right? You don't
think it's broken, do you?

1573
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,640
No, 'e can move it.

1574
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,400
You can do that, can't you?

1575
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,440
Why would I want to do that?

1576
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,520
Don't even...
Not in my room, Sophie.

1577
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,120
I need a fag

1578
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,440
I don't care. Cop hold o'that.

1579
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,120
Just don't start, right?

1580
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,360
It really is beyond me the way
you girls choose to live your lives

1581
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,480
My mind just boggles

1582
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,040
'E's gone back to sleep

1583
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:39,720
Was that the front door?

1584
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,080
'E's gone

1585
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,040
Thank God

1586
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:52,880
Go slowly, Johnny.

1587
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,720
Now what you two must do is take
this one to Casualty

1588
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:58,840
and make sure he gets himself looked at,
'fore he goes home.

1589
01:49:59,080 --> 01:49:59,720
I'm gonna be sick.

1590
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,080
- Are you?
- Get him into the bathroom!

1591
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:02,920
All right! Let's not...

1592
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:04,440
Just a minute...

1593
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,720
That's it.

1594
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,920
- Take it steady.
- Here y'are

1595
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,640
It's in me tash.

1596
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,160
You wanna gerrit cut.

1597
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,400
It's in your mouth

1598
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,160
'Ave you 'ad a bath lately?

1599
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:24,840
Yeah, I 'ad one yesterday

1600
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,240
- As if!
- I did!

1601
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,680
Where've you been, Johnny?

1602
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:29,240
Down the Via Dolorosa.

1603
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:30,560
Don't be nosy

1604
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,160
- Are you not goin' to work?
- I'm late

1605
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,400
Oh, you'll get the sack

1606
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,920
Yeah.

1607
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,200
It's all right - you can put
all your troubles in it.

1608
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:42,400
'Ey, I lost me bag.

1609
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:44,440
Yeah, I noticed. Where is it?

1610
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:45,640
I don't know. It's lost.

1611
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:46,920
Any valuables?

1612
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:50,200
Yeah, it's got me collection of
famous retired glove-puppets in there.

1613
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,080
That's it - all gone.

1614
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,600
Did you get it nicked?

1615
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,680
Would you put that out?

1616
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,520
I 'an't cleaned me teeth yet

1617
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,640
Could you not just put 'em in
a glass or something, no?

1618
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,880
I remember when you bought
these shorts. I warned you

1619
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:37,000
about 'em then.

1620
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,640
Yeah, well,

1621
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,040
I only got them to piss you off

1622
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:46,400
Mission accomplished.

1623
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,320
Is he all right?

1624
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:52,120
Yeah

1625
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:58,360
What is this, a spectator sport
or something?

1626
01:51:58,760 --> 01:51:59,840
The hundred-metre vomit.

1627
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,240
Sophie, d'you mind if I 'ave a word

1628
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:08,240
with Johnny on me own?

1629
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:17,040
D'you want a word with Louise 
on your own?

1630
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,680
Are you bein' sarcastic?

1631
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,480
No

1632
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:21,680
Well, do as you're told.

1633
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:25,120
Right...

1634
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,280
Whose is all this money?

1635
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:31,640
Three hundred and eighty pounds,

1636
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:33,960
it's really oughtn't to be left
laying waiting for ...

1637
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,680
Whose is all that?

1638
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,600
Dunno

1639
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,240
Who's been playing ping-pong
with your face?

1640
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,040
The sky fell in on me.
A cloud caught me across the cheek.

1641
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,360
So, why did you come to London?

1642
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,040
I come to run in the Marathon

1643
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,040
Will you give me a straight answer,
please?

1644
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:14,480
Well, I 'ad to get out of Manchester

1645
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,840
'cos I was gonna get a beatin'

1646
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,360
And I come down 'ere,
and I get a beatin'

1647
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,400
Were you asking for it?

1648
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:21,560
No.

1649
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:23,360
I wasn't.
They just came out of nowhere.

1650
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,600
Honest?

1651
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:25,640
Yeah.

1652
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:31,480
So what are you gonna do?

1653
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,680
What are you gonna do?

1654
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,520
What are you gonna do?

1655
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,960
Dunno. Might go 'ome for the weekend.

1656
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,000
Well, there's no place like it.

1657
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,320
Might not come back.

1658
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:45,800
Are you goin' back?

1659
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,120
Is that nice?

1660
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,400
Yeah.

1661
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,520
I'm puttin' the fun
back in 'fundament'.

1662
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,120
Are yer?

1663
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,000
Well, I'll 'ave to go back sometime,
won't I?

1664
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,160
And what about us?

1665
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,560
What about us?

1666
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:12,040
Do you hate me?

1667
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:13,640
Fuck off!

1668
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:20,320
My mam was seven years younger
than you when she had me.

1669
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,400
- Don't.
- What?

1670
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,000
Just...

1671
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:24,920
Well, she was!

1672
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,560
I'm full o' shit, aren't I?

1673
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:30,600
Sometimes

1674
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:32,560
Yeah, well, it's all right,
I've had it all kicked out of me now

1675
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:33,960
Oh? Good

1676
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:38,760
What if God just put us 'ere for
his own entertainment?

1677
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:43,360
That's all we are. Just somethin'
for 'im to 'ave

1678
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,760
a bit of a laugh at. Could be,
couln'n't it?

1679
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:47,960
If you think about it.

1680
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,120
Give us your right 'and.

1681
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:54,560
Other way up.

1682
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,440
What's that?

1683
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,520
That's funny to me

1684
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:09,960
You're daft, you

1685
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,920
It's toilet humor

1686
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:16,960
Will you give me a cuddle,

1687
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,240
Johnny?

1688
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:19,760
Yeah.

1689
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:06,840
If no one tells me what's going on,
then how am I supposed -

1690
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:09,040
I don't understand, Johnny!

1691
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,240
- 'Ow was Zambia?
- It was Zimbabwe!

1692
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:15,040
I went to Zimbabwe with my wanker
boyfriend, my ex...

1693
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:17,320
What did I do wrong?

1694
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:18,840
Did you see any big animals?

1695
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,640
Yes! We saw elephants and rhinos
and zebras

1696
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:23,240
and lions and vultures...

1697
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,360
Did you see any monkeys?

1698
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,640
We saw many monkeys.

1699
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,040
And were they cheeky?
Oh, it is not good for me, is it,
all this, in my condition?

1700
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:31,040
Well, yes, no, yes...

1701
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:35,360
It's not good for me. It's not good for you.
It's not good for any of us, it's utterly...

1702
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,760
Oh, excuse me for living!

1703
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,600
Is, is this it, Johnny?

1704
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:45,480
- Is it?
- Is what it?

1705
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,640
Oh, I can't bear it!

1706
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,320
Right! I'm off!

1707
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,240
Off your trolley.

1708
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,840
Oh, don't fuckin' take a piss
out of me you bastard!!

1709
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,040
You don't know!

1710
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,040
All I want...

1711
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,680
Nobody has any...

1712
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,920
Can you just please try...

1713
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,240
I've 'ad enough.

1714
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:08,640
This is a nightmare!

1715
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,840
Sophie, if you just try and pull
yourself together

1716
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,760
- Where are you going?
- I don't know

1717
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,240
Why don't you come in and have
a lie-down?

1718
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,640
I don't care!

1719
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:18,640
Sophie!

1720
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:20,240
- Here's the key
- Well, I don't wan' 'em!

1721
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,040
Well I don't fuckin' want them!

1722
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,040
I'm not a social worker!

1723
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:28,520
Look, Sophie. Don't be fuckin' stupid!

1724
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:30,520
What's the point, Louise?

1725
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:33,720
Sophie!

1726
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,640
I'm sorry

1727
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,320
Johnny

1728
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:12,400
You all right?

1729
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:15,800
I'm goin'

1730
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:16,960
Where?

1731
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,040
Work. To 'and my notice in.

1732
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,040
Then I'm comin' back 'ere,
I'm packing me bags,

1733
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,000
and I'm goin' 'ome.  D'you wanna come?

1734
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:24,840
- Today?
- Yeah.

1735
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,200
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1736
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,240
- 'Ow?
- Bus.

1737
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,240
- Well, 'ave you got enough dough?
- Yeah.

1738
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,000
- 'Cos I've not got nothin'
- I know.

1739
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:39,520
D'you think you can make it?

1740
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:41,840
Don't know.

1741
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,520
Well, if you dpn't,
we can stay 'ere until tomorrow.

1742
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,680
See you later.

1743
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,920
Can you leave us a few fags
for cancer research?

1744
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:05,560
Here are your...

1745
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,360
I was actually hoping that 
the air could...

1746
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:12,040
What are we gonna do about all this...

1747
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,240
I dunno, Sandra.
Look, I'll see you in 
a couple of hours.

1748
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:17,360
Fine.

1749
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:18,640
You will come back?

1750
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:20,720
Yeah, of course I will

1751
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:21,720
Because I need...

1752
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:22,760
You'll be all right, won't you?

1753
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:24,440
Will I be all right, love?

1754
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,760
I'm going to get the bath cleaned.

1755
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,760
You all know what it does to you

1756
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:50,120
and yet you still insist on doing it,
so... do it.

1757
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:52,560
Smoke yourself to...

1758
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,680
Well, birds do it, bees do it.

1759
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:55,920
..high heaven.

1760
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,960
Can you tell me something, love?

1761
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:01,360
Is it true that some babies are
born covered in fur?

1762
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,440
Up.

1763
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:05,680
Thank you.

1764
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:08,240
And you know at birth when they
cut the umbilical cord?

1765
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:11,040
What would happen if, well,
if it was never cut?

1766
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,040
I don't need this. I just...

1767
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:16,640
Well it would be embarrassin',
wouldn't it?

1768
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,840
Specially at my age.

1769
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,680
Why do you feel the need
to take the piss?

1770
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:23,440
I'm not takin' a piss.
It's nice, that -

1771
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,640
Where it is from?

1772
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,760
I don't know, it's something my dad...

1773
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:28,040
Now you see,

1774
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,080
Sophie just turned that to the wall,
she's got

1775
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:32,440
this kind of an irritating
proclivity for negation -

1776
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,360
I suppose she thinks it's
progressive, or somethin'.

1777
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,040
What is your problem?

1778
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,560
Nothing. What is your problem?

1779
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,640
All these silly questions and...

1780
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:42,800
Well, look, I've never met
a nurse before, and

1781
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,640
I'm just interested in, well, in life.

1782
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:47,040
I mean, d'you think it's worth savin'?

1783
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:51,520
Of course I do. But there is
a time and a place,

1784
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,040
and actually this isn't the time or...

1785
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:57,160
The place?

1786
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,280
No. And this

1787
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:01,480
is where I...

1788
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:02,880
Live?

1789
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,640
Yes,

1790
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:06,440
- and I'm not feeling very...
- Sexy?

1791
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,200
Comfortable, actually.
I'm not feeling very comfortable.

1792
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:12,360
Well make yourself comfortable, love.
Or slip into something more...

1793
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:13,040
comfortable

1794
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:16,040
My bath!

1795
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,240
Hot toast... hot milk..
hot-water bottle

1796
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,640
bed, sleep.

1797
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:22,800
D'you like me?

1798
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:25,240
I don't know you, so...

1799
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:26,880
D'you find me attractive?

1800
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,920
Well, listen, love, it's like this -
I find you attractive. Very attractive.

1801
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:35,040
Enough. I've had enough.

1802
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:39,440
It comes at me from all angles.

1803
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:41,240
You... all of you just...

1804
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,120
it's the tin lid...

1805
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:47,640
When... how will the world ever...

1806
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:49,320
End.

1807
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,640
Yes!
