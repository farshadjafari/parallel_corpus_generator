I had around the house,

I don't think there's
a doctor who could've
done any better.

It's not nearly
as bad as it looks.

90
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,440
You have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs,

91
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,443
and the fibula
in the right leg
is fractured, too.

92
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,778
I could hear
the bones moving,

93
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,407
so it's best for your legs
to remain immobile.

Well, I'm pretty sure
they're both not busy,
Miss Sindell,

103
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,731

106
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,783

I'm a literary agent,
and I... I feel like
a fool calling you,

110
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,670
but I think one
of my clients,
Paul Sheldon,

111
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,464
might be in some
kind of trouble.

112
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,300
You mean Paul Sheldon
the writer?

113
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,427
He's your client, huh?

114
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,720
Yes, he is.

those Misery books.

116
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:27,019

that Paul's been coming
to the Silver Creek Lodge

00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,937
for years
to finish his books.

118
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,857
I understand
he's been up here
the last six weeks.

119
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,860
Well, not quite.
I just called there

120
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,406
and they said
he checked out
last Tuesday.

121
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,866
Isn't that
a little strange?

122
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,910
I don't know.
Does he usually phone you

123
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,953
before he checks
out of a hotel?

124
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:50,209
No, of course not.
It's just that his daughter
hasn't heard from him,

125
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:54,338
and when he has
a new book coming out,
he usually keeps in touch.

126
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,049
Now when there wasn't
any word from him, I...

127
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,176
You think he might
be missin', huh?

128
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,386

129
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,348

Tell me I'm being silly.

00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:09,895

maybe, but tell you
what I'll do.

131
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,855
Nothing's been
reported out here,

132
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,775
but I'll put his name
through our system, and

133
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,238
if anything turns up,
I'll call you right back.

134
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,698

No reason.

141
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,354
I guess it was
kind of a miracle,
you finding me.

143
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,108
No, it wasn't
a miracle at all.

144
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,319
In a way,
I was following you.

145
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,529
You were following me?

146
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,949
Well, it wasn't any secret
to me you were staying
at the Silver Creek,

147
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,827
seeing as how I'm your
number-one fan and all.

148
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,539
Some nights I'd just
tool on down there
and sit outside

149
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,126
and look up at
the light in your cabin

150
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,170
and I'd try to imagine
what was goin' on
in the room

151
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,671
of the world's
greatest writer.

152
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,756
Say the last part again,
I didn't hear you.

153
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,300
Don't move now.

154
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,969
I wouldn't want
to hurt this neck.

155
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,391
Well, the other afternoon
I was on my way home,

156
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,478
and there you were,
leavin' the lodge.

157
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,355
And I wondered why
a literary genius
would go for a drive

158
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,316
when there was
a big storm comin'.

159
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,943
I didn't know there was
a big storm coming.

160
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,822
Well, lucky for you, I did.
And lucky for me, too,

161
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,534
'cause now you're alive
and you can write
more books.

And you're very brilliant.

00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,679
Thank you.

169
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,266
When do you think
the phone lines'll be up?
I have to call my daughter,

170
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,935
and I'd like to call
my agent in New York

171
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,811
and let her know

too much longer now.

tryin' them for you.

Could I ask you a favor?

I noticed in your case
there's a new
Paul Sheldon book, and

178
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,875
I wondered if maybe...

Well, if you wouldn't mind.

Well, I do have a very
hard-and-fast rule as to

182
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,968
who reads my stuff
at this early stage.

183
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,221
Only my editor, my agent,

184
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,267
and anybody that saves me
from freezing to death
in a car wreck.

new book called?

192

but I haven't
written anything

and you can tell me

198
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,813

come up with a title.

unusual about Mr. Sheldon's
leaving, Buster.

You can tell
by the champagne.

203
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,620
Maybe you can, Libby.

orders a bottle
of Dom Pérignon

when he's ready to go.

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,126
Then he pays up
and he's out the door.

207
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,505
No long-distance phone calls
or Federal Express packages?

208

Anything out
of the ordinary?

209
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,801
I don't think
Mr. Sheldon likes

210

for things to be
out of the ordinary.

in the same car each time,
a '65 Mustang.

He says it helps him
to think.

215

He's always
been a good guest.

216
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,032
Never makes a noise,
never bothers a soul.

217
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,701
I sure hope nothing's
happened to him.

218
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:35,994
So do I.

219
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,207
I bet that old Mustang
is pulling into
New York right now.

220
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,585
I'm sure you're right.
Thanks, Libby.

you write is brilliant.

who you were and
what had happened.

there's no infection
you're not in any danger,

she would tell her
you were okay,

I'm not against marriage
per se,

a pretty special guy
to make me

want to walk down
that aisle again.

348
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,479
Yeah, it's not something
you should enter
into lightly.

349
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,982
It boils down to respect.

350
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,319
People just don't respect
the institution of marriage
anymore.

351
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,071

of real commitment.

cannot be dead!

in childbirth.

is the important thing,

she just slipped away.

I thought clearly.

I asked God about you,

421
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,176
and God said,
"I delivered him unto you

422
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,554
"so that you may
show him the way."

423

not difficult at all.

the only copy, Paul.

When you were 24
you wrote your first book,
and you didn't make a copy

443

because you didn't think
anybody would
take it seriously.

00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,532
But they did.
And ever since you've
never made any copies

know it exists.

511
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,685
and now
you'll make it right.

512
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,564
It'll be a book
in my honor,

513
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:50,317
for saving your life
and nursing you
back to health.

514
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:55,447
Paul, you're gonna
make me the envy
of the whole world!

515
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,992
You just expect me
to whip something off,
is that it?

516
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,162
I expect nothing less
than your masterpiece.

517
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,960
You do understand
that this is not
the ordinary way

518
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,503
in which books get written.

519
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,257
I mean, some people
might actually consider this
an oddball situation.

520
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,926
I have total confidence
in your brilliance.

521
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,303
Besides, the view
will inspire you.

522
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,807
You just inhale that.
I'll be right back.

523
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,280
I guess you
don't get bothered
by neighbors much.

524
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,073
ANNIE: Don't you
worry about that,

525
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,743
you'll have total solitude
so you can concentrate
on your work.

526
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,036
Great.

527
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,666
I got you
this expensive paper
to type on,

528
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,002
and I got a great deal
on this 50-pound clunker,

529
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,421
on account of
its missing an "N."

530
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,965
I told the saleslady
"N" was one of the letters

531
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,633
in my favorite writer's name.

532
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:04,558
It's two of the letters
in my favorite
nurse's name, A-nn-ie.

533
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,937
You fooler! Did I do good?

534
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,564
You did great.

535
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,236
There is just
one little thing.

536
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:24,661
I can't work on this paper.
See, it's Corrasable Bond.
It smudges.

537
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:28,540
So I thought maybe,
if you went back into town,

538
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,085
you could bring me
some white long-grain mimeo.

539
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:37,341
But mine cost the most,
so I don't see
how it can smudge.

540
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,385

PAUL: I thought
you'd be interested.

I'd like for you to be
in on everything, Annie.

but how it's written.

for thinking of me.

while I'm in town?

crucial requirements
that need satisfying?

a tiny tape recorder?

Or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers?

552
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,439
No, just the paper
will be fine.

553
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,316

start showing me

the main reason I've never
been more popular

598

is because of my temper.

anywhere in the vicinity
of the accident.

615
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,312
We also know that
if anyone had found him

616
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:06,190
they would have taken him
to an area hospital.

617
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:09,277
Undoubtedly he is buried
somewhere out there
in the snow.

We'll find him
after the first thaw.

the animals didn't
get to him first,

01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,615
That's right.

643
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,367
When I was growing
up in Bakersfield,

644
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:04,827
my favorite thing
in all the world

645
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,830
was to go to the movies
on Saturday afternoons
for the chapter plays.

646

647
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,000
I know that, Mister Man!

They also call them serials.
I'm not stupid, you know!

649
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,176
Anyway, my favorite
was Rocketman,

650
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,136
and once it was
a no-brakes chapter,

651
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,347
and the bad guys stuck him
in a car on a mountain road,

652
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,182
and knocked him out
and welded the doors shut

653
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,392
and tore out the brakes
and started him to his death.

654
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:31,062
And he woke up
and tried to steer
and tried to get out,

655
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,439
but the car went off
a cliff before
he could escape,

656
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,732
and it crashed and burned

657
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,650
and I was so upset
and excited!

658
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,195

you better believe
I was first in line.

659

And they always
start with the end
of the last week,

660
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,699

trying to get out,

661
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,284
and here comes the cliff,

662
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,662
and just before the car
went off the cliff
he jumped free,

663
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,456
and all the kids cheered!

664
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,919
But I didn't cheer.
I stood right up
and started shouting,

665

happened last week!

for Dr. Cleary

672
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,907
at the end of the last book,
but his horse fell
jumping that fence,

673
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,410
and Ian broke his shoulder
and his ribs and lay
all night in the ditch

674
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:28,828
and he never reached
the doctor,

675
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,247
so there couldn't have
been any experimental
blood transfusion

676
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,165

in the ground
at the end, Paul,

to start there.

01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:21,130
Is it fair?
Should I continue?

680
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:24,300
You better!

681
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,470
Oh, Paul!
When Ian realized that

682
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:28,971
the reason they'd
buried Misery alive

683
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,724
was because the bee sting
had put her in
that temporary coma!

684
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,977
And when Gravedigger Wilkes
remembered how
30 years earlier

685
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,229
the same thing had happened
to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

686
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,357
And then old Dr. Cleary
deduced that Misery

687
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,485
must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's
long-lost daughter

688
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:46,447
because of the rarity
of deadly bee stings,
my heart just leapt!

689
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,990
I've known from
the very first book

690
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,658
that Misery had to
be born of nobility

691
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,118
and I was right!

692
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:52,203
Yeah.

693
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,497
Paul,
can I read each chapter
when you're finished?

694
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,790
I can fill in the "N's."

695
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:00,044
Will she be her old self
now that Ian has dug her out,

696
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,504
or will she have amnesia?

697
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,755
Have to wait.

698
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,966
Will she still love him
with that special,
perfect love?

699
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,468
You'll have to wait.

700
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,844

701
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,054

my Liberace records!

706
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,697
You do like Liberace,
don't you?

707
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,199
Whenever he played
Radio City,

708
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,743
who do you think
was right there
in the front row?

709
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,913
I'm gonna play my records
all day long, to inspire you.

710
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,623

712
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,755
Would you have
dinner with me tonight?

713
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,632
To celebrate Misery's Return.

done it without you.

717

No, he's not here.

718

I don't know where he is.

719
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,241
He never tells me
anything anymore.

720
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,578
He's probably out
havin' an affair somewhere.

721

Wait a minute.
He's comin' in now.

722
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:19,456
It's Jim Taylor.

723
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,293
He wants to know
who you're havin'
an affair with.

724
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,504
Hello, Jim.
What's doin'?

725
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:30,676
Jim, we've been
through this before.

726
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,262
If you're gonna have
benches out in front
of your store,

to sit on 'em.

728

Well, I don't like him,
either,

729
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,643
but I'm not gonna
come over there

730

Virginia, I'm flattered
that you think I've got
that much energy.

734
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,413
I figured that if
I can't find Paul Sheldon,

735
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,374
at least I can find out
what he wrote about.

736

who drove his car
off a cliff in a snowstorm?

738

You see, it's just
that kind of sarcasm

739
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,845

real spice.

I can imagine
what you might
be thinking of me.

But you see, Paul,
it's all okay.

856
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,145
Last night it came so clear.

857
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,481
I realize you just
need more time.

858

Eventually
you'll come to accept
the idea of being here.

859
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,571
Paul, do you know
about the early days

860
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,948
at the Kimberley
diamond mines?

861
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:55,702
Do you know what they did
to the native workers
who stole diamonds?

862
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:58,246
Don't worry.
They didn't kill them.

863
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,081
That would be like
junking a Mercedes

864
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,958
just because it had
a broken spring.

865
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,085
No, if they caught them
they had to make sure

866
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:05,461
they could go on working,

867
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:08,590
but they also
had to make sure
they could never run away.

868
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:11,259
The operation
was called "hobbling."

thinking about doing,

in Worcester, Massachusetts,

and Helene Sheldon,

01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:40,249
I got down on my knees
and I begged for it
not to be true.

I don't care.

01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:48,883
When I was praying,
God told me to get ready.

955
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:50,968
Get ready
for what?

01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:53,095

957
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:56,015
He gave so much pleasure
to so many people,

958
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:58,893

in case you
hadn't noticed.

960
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:03,898
God told me,
since I was his
number-one fan,

961
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,443
that I should make up
new stories as if
I was Paul Sheldon.

962
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:10,696
So I went to town,
and I bought
a typewriter,

963
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:11,906
and paper to type on,

964
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,408
the same kind
Paul Sheldon used.

965
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:17,369
And I turned
the guest bedroom
into a writing studio.

966
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:18,913

967
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:19,997

It's right this way.

969
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:34,261

he used,

he told.

974
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:47,024

and I know all the words,
but it's just not the same.

it takes a while
to get the hang of it.

of hundred pages of mine

me what you think.

so that Misery can live.

to give Misery eternal life.

01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:35,979
By dawn

1027
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,985
we'll be able to give Misery
back to the world.

1028
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,261
I'll fix you
something to eat.

1029
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,904
Paul, I'm dying!

1030
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:29,032
Does she wind up
with Ian or Windthorne?

1031
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,160
You'll know very soon.

1032
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:33,203
I've just started
the last chapter.

1033
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:39,543
You know, when I finish,
I'd like everything
to be perfect.

1034
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,629
I'll need three things.

1035
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:44,214
What things?

1036
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:47,468
You mean you don't know?

1037
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:48,802
(LAUGHING)

1038
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:51,263
I was foolin', silly.

1039
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:54,516
You need a cigarette,
because you used to smoke
but you quit,

1040
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:58,145
except when you
finish a book,
and you have just one.

1041
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,272
And the match
is to light it,

1042
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:04,485
and you need
one glass of champagne,
Dom Perignon.

1043
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:07,571
Dom Perignon it is.

1044
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,428
Annie, Annie?

1045
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:34,097
Yes, Paul?

1046
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:38,060
I'm almost done.

1047
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:40,854
Oh, Paul,
this is so romantic!

1048
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:44,274
Ian and Windthorne
dueling for the right
to Misery's hand.

1049
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:47,069
Does Ian win?
Don't tell me.

1050
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:48,445
It's Windthorne, right?

1051
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,823
You'll know everything
in a minute.

1052
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:53,158
Get the champagne.

1053
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:55,786
(EXCLAIMS)

1054
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,488
Did I do good?

1055
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,825
You did perfect.

1056
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,662
Except for one thing.

1057
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:43,041
This time we'll need
two glasses.

1058
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,378
Oh, Paul.

1059
01:39:21,414 --> 01:39:22,748
Remember how,
for all those years,

1060
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:25,709
nobody knew who
Misery's real father was?

1061
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:28,337
Or if they'd
ever be reunited?

1062
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:29,921
It's all right here.

1063
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:33,884
Does she finally marry Ian,
or will it be Windthorne?

1064
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,761
It's all right here.

1065
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:40,182
Paul, you can't!

1066
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:42,726
Why not?
I learned it from you.

1067
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:48,899
No, no, no!
Not Misery!
Not my Misery!

1068
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,902
No! Not my Misery!

MARCIA: This is it.
The very first copy.

1082
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:53,458
The word I'm getting is
the Times review is
gonna be a love letter.

1083
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:55,001
That'll be a first.

1084
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:58,338
And my contacts at
Time and Newsweek
tell me they're both raves.

1085
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,215
And don't laugh,
but for the first time

1086
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:02,425
I think you've got
a shot at some prizes.

1087
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,094
Great.

1088
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:06,304
I thought you'd be thrilled.

1089
01:43:06,389 --> 01:43:08,098
You're being taken seriously.

1090
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,141
I'm delighted
the critics are liking it

1091
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:12,394
and I hope the people
like it, too.

1092
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:15,188
But I wrote it for me.

1093
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:19,568
Now, don't think
I'm completely nuts, but...

1094
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:24,281
In some way, Annie Wilkes,

1095
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:27,117
that whole experience,

1096
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:30,704
helped me.

1097
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:32,831
Paul, since you
brought her up,

1098
01:43:32,915 --> 01:43:36,418
I have to ask you this
or I'll be drummed out
of the agents' union.

1099
01:43:36,502 --> 01:43:38,420
How would you feel
about a non-fiction book

1100
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:40,380
about what went on
in that house?

1101
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,883
Gee, Marcia,
if I didn't know you better,
I'd think you were suggesting

1102
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:44,426
I dredge up the worst
horror of my life

1103
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:47,304
just so we can make
a few bucks.

1104
01:43:48,264 --> 01:43:49,890
MARCIA: I thought you
were over it.

1105
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:53,685
I don't know if anyone
could ever totally get over
something like that.

1106
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:55,186
It's weird.

1107
01:43:56,731 --> 01:43:59,024
Even though I know
she's dead,

1108
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:03,528
I still think about
her once in a while.

1109
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:07,532
Excuse me.
I don't mean to bother you,
but are you Paul Sheldon?

1110
01:44:07,617 --> 01:44:09,117
Yes.

1111
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,828
I just want to tell you
I'm your number-one fan.

1112
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,873
That's very sweet of you.

1113
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:20,754
(SINGING) I'll be seeing you

1114
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:28,803
In all the old familiar places

1115
01:44:28,888 --> 01:44:35,268
That this heart
of mine embraces

1116
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:39,439
All day through

1117
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:48,782
In that small cafe

1118
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:54,329
The park across the way

1119
01:44:56,248 --> 01:45:02,170
The children's carousel

1120
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:05,423

1122
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:15,976
I'll be seeing you

1123

In every
lovely summer's day

1124
01:45:22,692 --> 01:45:27,696
In every thing
that's light and gay

1125
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:34,494
I'll always think
of you that way

1126
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:42,544
I'll find you
In the morning sun

1127
01:45:42,630 --> 01:45:47,965
And when the night is new

1128
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:53,265
I'll be looking at the moon

1129
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:57,975
But I'll be seeing you

1130
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,985
I'll be seeing you

1131
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:11,405
In every lovely summer's day

1132
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:16,370
I'll be seeing you
in every thing
that's light and gay

1133
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:21,790
I'll always
think of you that way

1134
01:46:23,755 --> 01:46:30,425
I'll find you
In the morning sun

1135
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:35,515
And when the night is new

1136
01:46:37,935 --> 01:46:43,895
I'll be looking at the moon

1137
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:50,655
But I'll be seeing you
