00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,193
Agente Hobbs!
Chief of Police,
João Alemeida.

182
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,444
Luke.

183
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,740
Sorry to hear about
the loss of your men.

184
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,866
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

185
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,493
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

186
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,079
One is a former federal
officer, been in deep cover
for five years.

187
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,998
He knows every way
you're going to come
for him.

188
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,167
The other one is
a professional criminal,
escaped prison twice,

189
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:37,796
spent half his life
on the run avoiding
folks like you.

190
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,714
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

191
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,842
Two things.
One, I need a translator.

192
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,426
We have plenty
in the public relations
department.

193
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,304
Elena Neves.

194
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,265
A patrol officer?
You heard me.

195
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,227
But why?
We have many
more experienced people.

196
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,311
I like her smile.

197
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,314
What's the second thing?

198
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,276
Stay the fuck out of my way.

199
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,696
(DRILLING)

200
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,163
Brian.
Hm?

201
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,040
I have something
I have to tell you.

202
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,792
(DOOR OPENING)
VINCE: God damn.

203
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,670
What a mess!

204
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,132
Where you been, man?

205
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,758
(CHUCKLING)

206
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:26,760
You better check that tone.

207
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,680
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

208
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:30,265
Stop it!
Both of you.

209
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,728
Where were you, Vince?

210
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,940
Guys all over
the favelas asking
about you.

211
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,651
Couldn't get out of there
without leading them
straight to you.

212
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,818
Had to wait them out.

213
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,612
That is such horseshit.

214
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,780
(SHOUTING) That was your job,
and those were your guys!
Hey!

215
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,450
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

216
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,326
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.

217
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,493
Go walk it off.

218
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:10,180
REYES: Look, I would love
to expand my operations
into your countries

219
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:14,267
but, quite frankly,
your business methods
are too violent.

220
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,604
Let me tell you a true story.

221
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:22,107
Five hundred years ago,
the Portuguese
and the Spanish came here,

222
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,653
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

223
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,367
The Spaniards arrived,
guns blazing, determined
to prove who was boss.

224
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,999
The natives killed
every single Spaniard.

225
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,837
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.

226
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,092
They came bearing gifts.

227
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,469
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

228
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,015
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

229
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,352
but to continue receiving
them, they had to work
for the Portuguese.

230
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,897
And that's why
all Brazilians speak
Portuguese today.

231
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,443
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,

232
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,781
they will eventually
fight back because
they have nothing to lose.

233
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,492
And that's the key.

234
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:17,372
I go into the favelas
and give them
something to lose.

235
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,208
Electricity, running water,

236
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,417
school rooms for their kids.

237
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:26,881
And for that taste
of a better life,

238
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,384
I own them.

239
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,595
Gentlemen.

240
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,557

(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

242
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,433
I apologize for
the interruption.

243
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,520
Señor Reyes,
may I speak with you?

244
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,106
We've found them.

245
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,777
Pardon me, gentlemen.

246
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,919
DOM: Almost wish
I didn't see that.

247
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,174
Almost.

248
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,301
Wait, Dom.

249
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,554
Mia was on that train.

250
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,263
(SHOUTING)
My sister!

251
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,517
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do
anything to hurt her.

252
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,935
You set up the deal!

253
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,646
I thought the job
was for the cars.

254
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,857
I didn't know.

255
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,401
All they want is the chip.

256
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,113
Damn!

257
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,406
You should've come clean.

258
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,075
What's going on out here?

259
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,161
Nothing.

260
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,705
Please, Dom, just let
me have the chip.
I can take this to them.

261
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,958
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.

262
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,044
Get out.

263
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,923
What?

264
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,049
Get out!

265
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,227
You never listen to me.

266
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,980
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.

267
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:10,777
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

268
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,153
Look at our family now.

269
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:18,284
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck
in this life!

270
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,327

271
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,830
Where's Letty?

272
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,773
Plasma cutter.

273
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:53,111
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles

274
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,945
that distributes
compressed gas tanks.

275
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:57,155
Pass me that manifest.

276
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,832
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.

277
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,292
You asked for me?
I did.

278
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,044
May I ask why?

279
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,547
My smile
is not that great.

280
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,678
Your husband was
an officer who was
gunned down in the favela.

281
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:20,637
Six months later,
you upped and joined
the force.

282
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,972
You're motivated.

283
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,809
Plus, I figure you're
the only one in Rio
who can't be bought.

284
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,311
Am I right?

285
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,731
Yes.
Of course I am.

286
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,982
Good news, bad news.

287
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,734
You know I like
my dessert first.

288
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,778
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.

289
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,864
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

290
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,656
One set of tracks
headed west

291
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,410
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

292
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,786
But another set
of tracks headed east.

293
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,247
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

294
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,915
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.

295
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,585
Followed the trail
a couple of miles.

296
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,877
Pretty easy in this scrub.

297
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,712
Can't move without
leaving a sign.

298
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,256
Give me the damn veggies.

299
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,634
The ground rolls into
a hardpack and we lost
that track, too.

300
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,471
Not necessarily.

301
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,973
That road heads up
through the hills
into the favelas.

302
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,393
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

303
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,854
It's all dirt a mile
from where you were.

304
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,106
If they headed that way,
we'll pick up
their tracks there.

305
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,442
You come prepared.

306
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,986
I'm motivated.

307
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,738

What do you think?

311
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:55,691
Well, it's definitely
a custom chip.

312
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,403

here for data entry.

same order every week.

316
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,874
It's a delivery schedule.

317
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
What's this?

318
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,441
Drugs?

319
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,443
No. That's a dealer pack.

320
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,445
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

321
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,405
so they don't have
to constantly count it.

322
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,824
Right there,
that's 49 kilos.

323
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:46,867
49 kilos is a million
in twenties.

324
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,037

of these shipments
is worth 10 million dollars?

off the grid.

that Reyes is smart
to want this back.

00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,317
They're going to be looking
for the three of us
together now.

357
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,110
We need to split up.

358
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,030
You and Mia head south,
I'll lead them away.

359
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,114
No.

360
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,492
Dom is right.

361
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,286
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

362
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:23,411
We have no choice
but to split up.

363
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,746
I'm pregnant.

364
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,085
I already lost
my family once.

365
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,715
I'm not going through
that again.

366
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,385
Are you kidding me?
No.

367
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,268
I'm not going
anywhere. Okay?

368
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,730
Dom?

369
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,775
Promise me
we stick together.

370
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,409
I promise.

371
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,458
Our family
just got bigger.

372
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,311
Something
doesn't add up.

373
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,271
Toretto and O'Conner.

374
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:36,360
They stay when they're
supposed to run, they steal
gas then give it away?

375
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,070
Now they're killing
federal agents?

376
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,864
It doesn't make any sense.

377
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,740
Here's what makes sense.

378
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,998
All these guys are
is names on a list.

379
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,498
They come up,
we take them down.

380
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,085
Not a phone call more,
not a bullet less.

381
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,878
Wilkes, we get anything?

382
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,630
Standard forensics.

383
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,507
Shoe prints.
Hair and fiber.

384
00:36:58,592 --> 00:36:59,717
Prints are all over the car.

385
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,885
Anything else?

386
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,262
Yeah, we tracked the owner
off the vehicle ID.

387
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,804
There are a couple
of shell companies
in between,

388
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,349
but we finally
traced it back
to a corporation

389
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,101
owned by an investor
down here named
Hernan Reyes.

390
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,186
Investor?

391
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,648
If there's anything
illegal happening in Rio,
Reyes is involved.

392
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,358
Okay, then so are we.

393
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,652
If he could get us
any closer to our guys,
I want everything on him.

394
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,070
Chato, you're
on the roof.

395
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,449
I want you on overwatch
in case somebody comes
back for something.

396
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,909
Mac, give me a cross-check
on Reyes, full specs.

397
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,202
If he goes to the john,
I want to know how
many times he shakes it.

398
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,664
You got it, boss.
Wilkes, Fusco!

399
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:33,250
Let's put all this
mess back together.

400
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,295
That's going to take a while.

401
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,630
Then you better get started.

402
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,632
They were taking
this car apart for a reason.

403
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,509
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

405
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,539
Hey, Dom,
what do you remember
about your father?

406
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:17,710
My father.

407
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,134
He used to...

408
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,179
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

409
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:31,224
For anybody
in the neighborhood.

410
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,519
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

411
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:40,150
Every single day he was
in the shop, and every
single night,

412
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:45,239
he was at the kitchen table
with Mia, helping her
with her homework.

413
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,284
Even after she went to sleep,

414
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,413
he'd stay up
for a few more hours

415
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,458
so he could learn
the next chapter
and help her the next day.

416
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,420
I remember everything
about my father.

417
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,297
Everything.

418
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,757
That's just it.

419
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,635
I don't remember shit
about my dad.

420
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,806
I don't remember
him yelling.

421
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,349
I don't remember
him smiling.

422
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,938
To be honest with you,
I don't even remember
what the hell he looked like.

423
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,233
I don't remember.
He just...

424
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,445
He was just never there.

425
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,782
You ain't going
to be like that, Brian.

426
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,552
We can't keep
running, Dom.

427
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,847
We got to get out.

428
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,849
We got to get out now.

429
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,393
You're right.

430
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,655
Here's how we're
going to do it.

431
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,079
We're going to use this.

432
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,081
We're going do one last job.

433
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,876
We're going to take
all of Reyes' money.

434
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,753
Every dime of it,

435
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,338
and disappear.

436
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:29,967
Forever.

437

438
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,181
New lives
with no more looking
over our shoulder.

439
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,934
And we're just going
to buy our freedom.

440
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,059
That's right.

441
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:39,728
You realize we're
talking about going
up against

442
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,146
the most powerful guy
in all of Rio?

443
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:42,898
Yes, we are.

444
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,235
Then we're going
to need a team.

445
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:55,202
Let's run through
the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

446
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,661

to need a chameleon.

Someone who can
blend in anywhere.

448
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,085
What else?

449
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,211
A fast talker.

450
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,632
Someone who can
bullshit their way
out of anything.

451
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,050
I got that.

452
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:13,469
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

453
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,264
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

454
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:20,059
DOM: And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have walls.

455
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,436
We're going to need guys
to punch through those walls.

456
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,440
MIA: What else?

457
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,733
Utilities and weapons.

458
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,570
Someone who ain't
afraid to throw down.

459
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,489
Someone to back up
every position.

460
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,117
BRIAN: Yeah, what else
do we need?

461
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,827
DOM: Most importantly,

462
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:40,121
we're going to need
two precision drivers.

463
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,833
Guys that don't crack
under pressure.

464
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,376
Guys that never lose.

465
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,961
You know we got that.

No paper trail
means no banks.

And no banks means
cash houses.

I thought this was business.

523
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,760
Sounds personal to me.

524
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:42,304

01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:05,556
We need to do some
more recon, call in
a couple of extra guys.

876
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,891
Or

877
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,520
you don't send a man
to do a woman's job.

878
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,538
We're going to figure
this out, I promise you.

879
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,127
What's up?

880
01:10:15,752 --> 01:10:18,296
I thought you were
more of a thong man.

881
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,715
We got the print.

882
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,592
Where?

883
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,555
Okay, that's crazy.

884
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:32,769
So, did he just slap
that ass or did he grab
and hold on to it?

885
01:10:33,061 --> 01:10:34,061
(BOTH LAUGHING)

886
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,399
Hey, this will work.

887
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,275
TEJ: I'm impressed.

888
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,360
Got it?
TEJ: Got it.

889
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,154
But you still didn't
answer the question.

890
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,579
Oh, no. Guys, guys!
Guys, we have a problem.

891
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:53,916
The whole team just got burnt.

892
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,168
Now we're all wanted.

893
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,338
GISELE: How did this happen?

894
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:04,091
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

895
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,011
Agent L. Hobbs.

896
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:07,386
Hold on one second.

897
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,555
Hey, Dom.

898
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,018
Is that the guy you saw
in the favela?

899
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:16,979
Yeah.

900
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,817
Hobbs is the leader
of the elite task force
for the DSS.

901
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,027
So he's good.

902
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,197
When the FBI wants
to find somebody,
that's who they call.

903
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,032
Because he never
misses his mark.

904
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:29,993
This guy is Old Testament.

905
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,372
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

906
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:36,166
And right now
he's hunting us?

907
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,960
Dom, we got to move up
our timeline.

908
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,168
ROME: Yeah, but how?

909
01:11:39,252 --> 01:11:42,713
This thing's already been
difficult without Wyatt Earp
on our asses.

910
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:45,050
If anything,
we need more room
to breathe.

911
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,761
Roman's right.

912
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,059
Think we need to get
some fresh air.

913
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,064
We've got a hit.
'70s Charger.

914
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,149
Let's get a move on!

915
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,155
Eastbound on
Avenida Atlantica.

916
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,658
Move, move, move, move!

917
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:17,582
It stopped about
a block ahead.

918
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,667
Park it.
We're going on foot.

919
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,109
Hey, Toretto.

920
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,827
You're under arrest.

921
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,287
Arrest?

922
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:58,372
I don't feel like
I'm under arrest.

923
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,375
How about you,
Brian?

924
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,626
No, not a bit.

925
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:04,837
Not even a little bit.

926
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:07,173
Just give it a minute.
It'll sink in.

927
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,055
BRIAN: We didn't kill
those feds. That was Reyes.

928
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,430
HOBBS: I don't give a shit.

929
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,309
I'm just here to bring
in two assholes whose names
hit my desk.

930
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:20,811
Yeah, that sounds
like a real hero.

931
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,399
That's funny.

932
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,569
From a guy who took the oath
of a cop, then went against
everything it stood for.

933
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,404
Or some wannabe
tough guy prick

934
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,865
who beat a man half
to death with
a socket wrench.

935
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:34,826
Yeah, real tough.

936
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,997
You turn around
and put your hands
behind your back.

937
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,582
I don't think so.

938
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,293
Your mistake is
thinking you got
a goddamn choice, boy.

939
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,050
And your mistake?

940
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,176
Thinking you're in America.

941
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,850
You're a long way from home.

942
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,854
This is Brazil.

943
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,331
Come on, boss.
Another day.

944
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,502
Come on, H,
it's a lot of heat.

945
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,051
I'll see you soon,
Toretto.

946
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,971
I look forward to it, cop.

947
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,260
Yep.

948
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,720
Tracker's on.

949
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,096
Got them.

950
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,707
I don't understand.
Why come here?

951
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:31,043
Why risk it all
for $20 worth of silver?

952
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:35,881
Because it's worth it.

953
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,220
You should run,
you know.

954
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,390
Hobbs will find you.

955
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:49,020
You have every reason
to leave. Why stay?

956
01:16:56,444 --> 01:16:58,529
Why do you?

957
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,074
My husband was
a good police officer.

958
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,536
An honest man.

959
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,663
We both grew up here.

960
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,958
Two years ago he was
murdered in the street

961
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:12,793
right outside our door.

962
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:19,050
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

963
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,680
But everything
has a price.

964
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,143
The people here
need a new start.

965
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,228
They need
to be free.

966
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:39,404
(SIGHS)

967
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:41,739
You didn't kill
those men in the train,

968
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,699
did you?

969
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:51,041
Now, why would you
believe anything
I would tell you?

970
01:17:57,922 --> 01:17:59,215
Hey!

971
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,304
Was she so special to you?

972
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,435
I never thought anyone
could understand how much.

973
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,274
But you do.

974
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:40,465
Yeah!

975
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,976
Close, but not enough.

976
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,104
Dom, the window
is too small, man.

977
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:58,942
Only way we're going to
beat the cameras is
with invisible cars.

978
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:04,029
And I know just where
to get them.

979
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:08,451
Let's take a ride, boys.

980
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:18,377
Don't hurt yourself.

981
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:39,399
It's been a while since
I've been behind the wheel
of one of these.

982
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,609
First time I've ever
been in the front seat.

984
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:50,909
Rome, what took
you so long?

985
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:55,122
I thought for sure you'd be
showing up with some
chrome spinners or something.

986
01:19:56,207 --> 01:19:57,207
Real funny.

987
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:02,337
I got $100,000 that says
I can take you all
in the next quarter-mile.

988
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:03,965
Yeah, your broke ass
has got a hundred grand.

989
01:20:04,048 --> 01:20:06,384
If we pull off this job,
I will.

990
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,219
The next two lights.

991
01:20:08,511 --> 01:20:09,679
Hundred thousand.

992
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,432
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

993

Let's make it a million.

994
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,229
I like that.
All right,
a million-dollar quarter-mile.

995
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:22,024
All right, then.

996
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,860
You only live once.
Let's do it.

997
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,404
What do you say, Dom?

998
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,530
We talking or we racing?

999
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,074
Just don't cheat this time.

1000
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,328

this money. I'm hungry.

easy for me, boys.

No!

1007
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,872
Not this time, Dom.

1008
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,462
You got to want it, Brian.

Good race, O'Conner.
Thanks, Dom.

Do you know how long
I've been waiting
for that shit?

1012
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:20,350
I told you
he didn't see it.

1013
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,270
Your man right there?

1014
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,771
He let off the throttle
at the line.

You didn't do nothing.
He let you win.

Bullshit.
