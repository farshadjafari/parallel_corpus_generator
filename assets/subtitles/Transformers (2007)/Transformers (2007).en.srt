1
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,598
Before time began, there was the Cube.

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,226
We know not where it comes from,

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,607
only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.

4
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,194
That is how our race was born.

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,739
For a time, we lived in harmony,

6
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:19,454
but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.

7
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,665
And so began the war,

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:27,837
a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:33,050
and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.

10
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:39,432
We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

11
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,061
searching every star, every world.

12
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:50,526
And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us

13
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:55,072
to an unknown planet called Earth.

14
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,373
But we were already too late.

15
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,889
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,475
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,644
A plate of mama's alligators étouffée.

18
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,896
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,149
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,569
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,737
I understand.

22
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,618
English, please. English.

23
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,413
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,749
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,753
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,883
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,719
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,765
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,852
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,353
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,604
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,458
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,461
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,671
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,967
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,262
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,223
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,601
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,312
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,980
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:02,491
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,709
Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.

43
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,629
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,551
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,512
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

46
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:33,105
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,359
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,654
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,323
Tail 4500 X-ray.

50
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,909
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,827
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,996
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

53
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,082
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,711
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

55
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,092
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,389
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

57
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,393
- My ladies!
- Look.

58
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,436
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,731
Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.

60
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,525
Baby, we made a good-looking kid.

61
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,777
I know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,238
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,115
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,784
- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.

65
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,829
You sure she didn't just fart?

66
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,747
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,375
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,754
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,469
Bogie's on the deck.

70
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,764
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,101
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,770
- Will?
- Sarah?

73
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,733
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,447
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

75
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,495
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

76
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,835
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

77
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,680
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

78
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,980
My God.

79
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,209
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

80
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,405
Go! Move! Move!

81
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,081
It's going after the files!

82
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,541
Cut the hard lines!

83
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,584
I need a key! It's locked!

84
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,088
Move! Move!

85
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,846
Here, come here! Come here!

86
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,904
Here, hide in here!

87
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,073
Oh, my God. Okay.

88
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,784
No!

89
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,579
Oh!

90
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,299
What the...

91
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,059
Epps, let's go!

92
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,498
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

93
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,210
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

94
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,502
Watch.

95
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,754
Okay.

96
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,340
For my family...

97
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,844
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

98
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,265
Okay.

99
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,268
So, for my family genealogy report,

100
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,480
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

101
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,816
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

102
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,318
Very famous explorer.

103
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:35,866
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

104
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:43,165
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.

105
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,337
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

106
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:53,842
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

107
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,722
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

108
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,225
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

109
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,436
So that's the story, right?

110
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,730
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

111
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,691
used by 19th-century seamen.

112
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,986
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

113
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,362
It's all for sale, by the way.

114
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:18,200
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

115
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,786
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

116
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,622
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

117
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,958
Are you going to sell me his liver?

118
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,627
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11 th grade.

119
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,878
I don't think your grandfather would be

120
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,213
particularly proud of what you're doing.

121
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,550
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

122
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,719
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

123
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,137
Cold hard cash works, too.

124
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,556
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

125
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,974
- Sam!
- Sorry.

126
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,892
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

127
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,814
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

128
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,065
drawing these strange symbols

129
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,651
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

130
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,403
that he thought he'd discovered.

131
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,407
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

132
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,743
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

133
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,245
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

134
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,914
Okay. Pretty good, right?

135
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,252
I'd say a solid B-.

136
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,921
A B-?

137
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,090
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

138
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,342
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

139
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,676
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

140
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,095
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

141
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,764
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,516
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

143
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,352
And a man's promise to that boy.

144
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,271
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car."

145
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,690
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

146
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,942
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

147
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,113
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

148
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,951
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

149
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,746
Yes! Yes, yes.

150
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,290
So?

151
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,541
A-. It's an A, though.

152
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,377
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

153
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,212
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

154
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,216
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

155
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,551
Yeah, a little surprise.

156
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,139
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

157
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,642
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

158
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,645
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

159
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,067
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

160
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,652
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

161
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,405
a Porsche for your first car?

162
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,657
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

163
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,327
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

164
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,915
- Manny!
- What?

165
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,501
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

166
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,669
He's having a heat stroke again.

167
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,920
Scaring white folks.

168
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,548
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

169
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,259
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

170
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,927
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

171
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,430
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

172
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,014
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

173
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,433
- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,602
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

175
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,521
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

176
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,773
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

177
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,191
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

178
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,359
Gentlemen.

179
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:02,197
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

180
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,365
How can I help you?

181
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,285
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

182
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,288
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

183
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,709
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

184
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,211
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

185
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,216
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

186
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,304
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

187
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,306
The car'll pick the driver.

188
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,225
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

189
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,228
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

190
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,900
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

191
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,654
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

192
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,823
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

193
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,414
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

194
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,999
This ain't bad.

195
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,336
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

196
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,754
It got racing...

197
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,256
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

198
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,091
I don't know nothing about this car.

199
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,426
- Manny!
- What?

200
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,179
What is this? This car! Check it out!

201
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,765
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!

202
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,351
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

203
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,019
Feels good.

204
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,607
- How much?
- Well,

205
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,529
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

206
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,447
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

207
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,618
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

208
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,786
It's custom faded?

209
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,622
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

210
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,542
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

211
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,544
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

212
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,212
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

213
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,465
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

214
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,802
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

215
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,971
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

216
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,723
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

217
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,809
This is a classic engine right here.

218
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,311
I sold a car the other day...

219
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,731
Gee. Holy cow.

220
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,316
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

221
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,153
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

222
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,905
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

223
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,157
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

224
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,159
...Greater than man...

225
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,413
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

226
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,472
$4,000.

227
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,445
Steve.

228
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,447
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

229
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,034
They're so young.

230
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,286
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

231
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,622
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

232
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,125
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

233
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,211
I am so underdressed.

234
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,340
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

235
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,885
Please be seated.

236
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,888
I'm John Keller.

237
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,224
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

238
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,561
At 1900 local time yesterday,

239
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,856
the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.

240
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,318
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

241
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,030
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

242
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,240
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

243
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,744
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

244
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,748
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

245
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,168
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

246
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,255
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

247
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,556
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

248
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,103
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

249
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,688
and intercept further communications,

250
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,607
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

251
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,903
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

252
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,614
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

253
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,283
The President has dispatched
battle groups

254
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,538
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

255
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,289
Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.

256
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,292
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

257
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,961
Good luck to us all.

258
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,807
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

259
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,396
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

260
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,689
Zero bids.

261
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,484
Great. Broke.

262
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,987
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

263
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,323
No. Premature.

264
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,742
Good. What's up?

265
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,661
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

266
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,165
It's like clockwork.

267
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,833
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

268
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,003
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

269
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,422
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

270
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,676
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

271
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,927
This one is wobbly.

272
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:20,182
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

273
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,349
- Sam...
- What?

274
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,019
I do not like footprints on my grass.

275
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,354
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

276
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,106
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

277
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,358
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

278
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,444
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it any more.

279
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,695
You're putting girl jewelry
on a boy dog.

280
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
What?

281
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,240
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

282
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,034
That's his bling.

283
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,036
I want you home at 11:00!

284
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,954
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

285
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,207
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

286
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,541
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,551
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,680
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,066
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

290
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,567
Oh, my God.

291
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,487
Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,

292
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,739
our highest readiness level.

293
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,742
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,245
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,164
But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...

296
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,999
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,670
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,506
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,592
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

300
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,928
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,180
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

302
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,598
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

303
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,851
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

304
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,895
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

305
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,899
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,527
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,195
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

308
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,616
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

309
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,620
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,623
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,125
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,585
My radio's fried.

313
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,713
- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.

314
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,716
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,384
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

316
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,136
All right, let's hit it.

317
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,892
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,937
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,815
Oh, my God.

320
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,485
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

321
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,154
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

322
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,322
Okay.

323
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,912
Hey, guys, check it out.

324
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,371
Oh, hi.

325
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:52,584
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,799
So, what are you guys doing here?

327
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,385
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,971
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

329
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,556
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

330
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,643
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

331
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,479
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:16,483
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,319
I was researching a book I was writing.

334
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,695
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,156
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,328
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

337
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,664
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,917
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

339
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,586
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

340
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,380
That's funny.

341
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,174
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,262
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

343
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,431
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,142
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

345
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,269
What are you doing?

346
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,438
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,983
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,361
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

349
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,406
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

350
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,534
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,871
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,541
Okay.

353
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,377
You'll call me.

354
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,678
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

355
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,263
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

356
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,265
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

357
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,018
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,686
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,104
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

360
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,605
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,357
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

362
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,192
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,694
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

364
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,945
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,864
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

366
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,032
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,616
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,374
Who's gonna come around
when you break?

369
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,377
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,545
Witwicky.

371
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,048
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

372
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,215
You sure?

373
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,134
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

374
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,721
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

375
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,931
There you go.

376
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,148
So...

377
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,321
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,408
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,494
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

380
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,832
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

381
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,919
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

382
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,589
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,257
Big arms?

384
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,012
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

385
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,598
Like, I just put in that light there.

386
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,144
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,106
Yeah.

388
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,612
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,614
Oh, no, no.

390
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,616
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,992
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,702
Yeah, a long time.

393
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,704
Well, do we have any classes together?

394
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,373
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

395
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,960
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,336
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

397
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,881
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

398
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,633
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

399
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,426
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

400
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,012
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

401
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,016
No, no, no. No. Come on.

402
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,770
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

403
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,357
When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing

404
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,193
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

405
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,987
Sexual healing

406
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,322
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

407
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,409
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

408
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,911
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,705
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,123
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,584
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,753
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

413
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,338
I feel good

414
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,882
Just pop the hood.

415
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,468
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

416
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,139
Whoa, nice headers.

417
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,807
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,310
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

419
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,644
Double-pump?

420
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,480
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,276
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,280
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,241
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:40,330
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,875
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

426
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,085
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

427
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,295
Oh, my God.

428
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,963
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,091
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,844
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,805
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

432
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,474
I prefer it, actually.

433
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,435
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

434
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,729
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

435
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,316
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,154
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,948
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,368
All right.

439
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,453
Walking's healthy, right?

440
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,831
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,459
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

442
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,379
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

443
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,008
Baby come back
any kind of fool could see

444
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,343
Hey!

445
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:40,390
There was something
in everything about you

446
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,560
Baby come back
you can blame it all on me

447
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,020
Hey!

448
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,316
Wait a second!

449
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,903
I was wrong
and I just can't live without you

450
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,073
There it is.

451
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,577
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

452
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,332
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

453
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,586
I think you're... No, no, no. I think...

454
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,341
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

455
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,386
Okay.

456
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,221
Yeah.

457
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,849
All right, I'll see you at school.

458
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,058
All right.

459
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,399
That's stupid.

460
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,734
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,695
"There's a lot more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,407
Oh, God.

463
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,410
Oh, my God. I love my car.

464
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:58,968
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

465
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,764
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

466
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,601
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

467
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,312
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

468
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,817
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

469
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,986
We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,

470
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,280
we'll know just what to do with them.

471
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,991
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,426
Apparently, there are
very few survivors.

473
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,719
Yes, Mr. President?

474
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,806
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

475
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,988
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,515
Shoot.

477
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,030
Gross.

478
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,893
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,397
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,066
I think they're hacking
the network again.

481
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,418
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,337
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

483
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,422
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

484
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,852
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,479
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,439
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

487
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,108
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

488
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,403
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,030
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,866
Air Force One, someone on board
has breached the military network.

491
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,786
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,750
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

493
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,962
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

494
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,798
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,885
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,326
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,869
What the...

498
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,752
Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.

499
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,672
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

500
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,775
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,904
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,116
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,367
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,101
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

505
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,478
That's my car!

506
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,272
No!

507
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,484
No, no, no, no.

508
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,119
Dad, call the cops!

509
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:03,040
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,877
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,464
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

512
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,342
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

513
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,137
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

514
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,337
Oh, my God.

515
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,147
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:12,193
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

517
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,029
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

518
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,490
and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

519
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,575
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

520
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,369
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,455
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

522
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,219
No! No! No! No!

523
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,140
Oh, my God.

524
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,227
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

525
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,561
Oh, my God.

526
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:55,569
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

527
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,824
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

528
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,244
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,498
Listen, listen, listen.

530
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,916
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

531
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,584
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

532
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,754
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,424
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,440
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

535
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,110
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

536
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,862
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

537
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,031
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,784
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

539
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,870
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

540
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,539
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus any more.

541
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,707
It's become the system.

542
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,960
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,712
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,047
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

545
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,134
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

546
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,469
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,388
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,641
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,728
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

550
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,480
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

551
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,233
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,068
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,654
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,073
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,744
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,164
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,583
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,835
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,254
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,924
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,426
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,180
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,183
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

564
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,602
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

565
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,271
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:58,275
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

567
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,201
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

568
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,454
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

569
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,707
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:15,960
Okay, chiefie.

571
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,129
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,965
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,467
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,886
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

575
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,515
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,394
ls that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:37,147
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,361
What was that?

579
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,199
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

580
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,829
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,165
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,710
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,595
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,600
Hey, heads up!

585
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,354
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,236
What the heck was that?

587
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,243
English, dude. English.

588
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,792
Whoa!

589
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,961
Watch out!

590
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,720
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

591
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,888
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

592
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,098
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

593
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,609
Get up! Get up! Come on!

594
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,534
Go! Move it!

595
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,924
Take cover!

596
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,303
Fig! Cover the rear!

597
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,850
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

598
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,978
Come on! Give me a mag!

599
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,815
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

600
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,024
Papa!

601
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,902
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

602
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,363
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

603
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,073
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

604
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,449
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

605
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,617
Fire!

606
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,287
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

607
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,915
It's an emergency Pentagon...

608
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,919
I don't have a credit card!

609
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:08,132
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

610
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,926
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

611
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,305
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

612
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,975
Ammo!

613
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,686
I need a credit card!

614
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,440
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

615
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,819
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

616
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:33,115
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

617
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,118
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

618
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,203
Okay, it's Visa.

619
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,705
Also, sir, have you heard about

620
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,915
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

621
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,171
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

622
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,425
Give me a status.

623
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,386
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

624
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,180
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

625
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,347
Survivors?

626
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,769
I ain't never seen this in my life!

627
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,605
Need gunships on station ASAP!

628
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,898
Predator's coming up in a minute.

629
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,399
We're linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.

630
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,658
Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

631
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,620
Predator ETA two minutes.

632
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,339
Hey! Make way!

633
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,262
- What is that?
- I don't know.

634
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,269
We need air support
and we need it now.

635
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,439
Roll in strike package Bravo
on unknown target.

636
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:51,151
I authenticate Tango Whiskey
at time 0300 Zulu.

637
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,112
Attention, all aircraft. This will be
a danger close-fire mission.

638
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,739
Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.

639
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,532
Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?

640
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,159
- Send the Hogs, sir.
- Okay, send the Hogs over

641
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,953
to Kill Box One Alpha.
It's a danger close...

642
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,622
Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,
300 feet danger close.

643
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,624
Friendlies in the area.

644
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,752
Seven-man team
north of orange smoke!

645
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,089
Received Kill Box One Alpha.
Engage hostile.

646
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,719
Attack direction west!
You're clear and hot!

647
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,307
Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.

648
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,268
Hog One-One Dark Star status.

649
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,731
- Lennox! The heat's coming!
- Laze the target!

650
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,401
We got a beam-rider incoming!
Laze target!

651
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,369
- Ready! Heat's coming!
- What? Bring it!

652
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,080
Receiving radar jamming
in vicinity of target.

653
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,223
No frigging way
that thing's still not down.

654
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,601
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells.
Bring the rain.

655
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,232
Be advised, ground team is requesting
105 sabot rounds.

656
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,553
Did we lose them?

657
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,222
Warthog One confirm visual
on friendlies.

658
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,478
Where's Fig?

659
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,022
- Fig? Fig?
- Oh, God!

660
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,775
- God damn it!
- Get a medic!

661
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:55,984
Get a medic!

662
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,194
- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...

663
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,487
We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.

664
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,447
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

665
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,913
Bring them home.

666
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,666
You get those men stateside right now.

667
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,710
I want them debriefed in 10 hours.

668
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:24,012
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

669
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,150
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

670
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,947
I am sorry to bother you.

671
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,907
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

672
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:47,994
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

673
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,788
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?

674
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,998
Shut up, Grandma!

675
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,543
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

676
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,753
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

677
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,219
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

678
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,724
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

679
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,148
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

680
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,108
Yeah. Get low.

681
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,362
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

682
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,322
Hey. I need a moment.

683
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,658
- Please.
- Sorry.

684
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,827
Hey, man, save my game.

685
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,787
How classified?

686
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:36,168
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

687
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,420
Yes! One quick peek.

688
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:42,382
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

689
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,010
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

690
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,678
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

691
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,680
but we also have a security issue.

692
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,057
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

693
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,851
of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,149
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,568
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

696
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,236
in less than a minute.

697
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,530
- No way.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:11,411
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,169
"Project iceman"?

700
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,672
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

701
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,551
Are you playing
those video games again?

702
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,720
Cops! Cops!

703
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,556
FBl! Clear right!

704
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,477
Lock it down! Lock it down!

705
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,230
Cops!

706
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,564
Lock it down.

707
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:43,193
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

708
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,864
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

709
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,574
Especially police!

710
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,953
It was an awesome spectacle here
an hour ago

711
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:56,915
when over 40 C-17s lifted off
of this very base.

712
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,584
We're not told where they're going.

713
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:00,752
Morning, Mo.

714
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,088
The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...

715
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,839
- Mojo. Mojo.
- They were headed directly

716
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,466
towards North Korea.

717
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,427
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

718
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,808
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

719
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,936
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

720
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,939
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

721
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:29,864
Stop!

722
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,700
No, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,332
Oh, my God!

724
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,251
Sam?

725
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,297
Hi.

726
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,800
That was... That was really awesome.

727
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,969
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

728
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,096
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

729
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,056
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

730
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,392
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

731
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,885
Oh, great. Cops.

732
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,183
Officer!

733
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,561
Listen!

734
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,105
Oh, that hurt.

735
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,318
Listen to me!

736
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,279
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

737
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:55,075
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

738
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,744
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

739
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:04,334
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

740
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:09,130
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

741
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:14,302
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

742
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,267
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

743
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,979
Okay.

744
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,945
Oh, God, no! No!

745
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:39,369
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

746
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,124
It's a bad dream.

747
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,794
Are you username LadiesMan217?

748
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,045
I don't know what you're talking about!

749
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,548
Are you username LadiesMan217?

750
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,799
Yeah.

751
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,301
Where is eBay item 21153?

752
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,137
Where are the glasses?

753
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:09,983
Get back!

754
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:11,901
Stop!

755
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:15,989
God!

756
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,575
What is your problem, Sam?

757
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,660
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

758
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:25,248
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

759
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,923
Sam, what is that thing?

760
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,425
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

761
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,594
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

762
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:42,098
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

763
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,028
Go, go, go, go!

764
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,451
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

765
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,119
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

766
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,538
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

767
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,540
Oh, my God! No!

768
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,958
We're gonna die!

769
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,382
Oh, my God!

770
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:34,901
We're locked in.

771
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,865
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

772
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,872
Okay.

773
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,917
Time to start.

774
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,566
He's got me! Oh, God!

775
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,991
He's going to kill me!

776
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,787
No. No, no, no!

777
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:25,511
Get off!

778
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,194
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,862
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

780
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,704
Not so tough without a head, are you?

781
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,128
Here, come on.

782
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,395
What is it?

783
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,231
It's a robot.

784
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,942
But like a...

785
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:24,570
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

786
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,365
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,909
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

788
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,246
What are you doing?

789
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,377
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

791
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,922
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

792
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,427
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

793
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,096
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

794
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,725
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

795
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,352
- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...

796
00:55:56,437 --> 00:56:00,023
Digital cable brings you...
...Columbia Broadcasting System...

797
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,899
So you... You talk through the radio?

798
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,902
Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.

799
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,988
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

800
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,573
Message from Starfleet, Captain...

801
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,742
Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...

802
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,785
Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!

803
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,038
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,290
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

805
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,631
Anymore questions you want to ask?

806
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,468
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,970
And go where?

808
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,681
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

809
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,934
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,091
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,342
I know.

812
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,013
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

813
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,307
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

814
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,517
Yeah.

815
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,353
You're right.

816
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,857
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

817
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:29,862
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

818
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,282
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

819
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,992
- Yeah.
- Okay.

820
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,413
There, see? That's better.

821
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,165
- Okay.
- Okay.

822
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:48,214
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

823
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,341
Thank you.

824
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,427
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:56,597
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

826
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,350
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,061
Whoa! Whoa!

828
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,897
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

829
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,065
Move it, you moron!

830
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,234
Great, now... See?

831
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,736
Fantastic.

832
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,738
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,490
That car is sensitive.

834
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,784
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

835
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,090
What?

836
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,155
This is you...

837
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,204
Oh, my God!

838
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,171
Come on, let's go.

839
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,263
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

840
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,849
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!

841
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,185
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

842
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,784
Whoa! Sweet!

843
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,995
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

844
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,371
'cause he is so boned!

845
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,626
What is that?

846
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,753
There's something in the tree, dude.

847
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,964
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

848
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,424
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

849
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,337
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

850
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,924
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

851
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,510
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

852
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,274
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

853
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,193
They know your name.

854
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,112
Yeah.

855
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,614
My name is Optimus Prime.

856
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:09,785
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

857
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,289
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

858
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:18,752
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

859
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:22,381
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

860
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,800
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

861
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,554
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

862
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,475
My weapons specialist, ironhide.

863
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,979
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, ironhide.

864
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,316
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

865
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,694
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

866
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,948
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

867
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,662
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

868
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,581
Bumblebee, right?

869
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,374
Check on the rep
Yep, second to none

870
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,835
So you're my guardian, huh?

871
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,174
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

872
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,347
Why are you here?

873
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:16,685
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

874
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,479
Mega-what?

875
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:33,661
Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,

876
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:39,542
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

877
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:43,921
All who defied them were destroyed.

878
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:50,135
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

879
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:57,142
Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.

880
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,979
My grandfather.

881
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:04,316
It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.

882
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,029
Come back!

883
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:14,159
I think the dogs have found something.

884
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:16,996
The ice is cracking!

885
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,383
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

886
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,177
I'm all right, lads!

887
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,931
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

888
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:48,402
Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.

889
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,451
Men! We've made a discovery!

890
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:59,955
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.

891
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:19,391
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

892
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,518
How'd you know about his glasses?

893
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,854
- EBay.
- eBay.

894
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:27,107
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

895
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:33,072
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

896
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:36,575
And the human race
will be extinguished.

897
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:42,122
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

898
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:48,170
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

899
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,678
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

900
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,805
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

901
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,139
Melted right through.

902
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,476
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

903
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,812
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

904
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:07,106
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

905
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,483
- Heads up!
- Oh!

906
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,945
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

907
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,032
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

908
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,492
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

909
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,828
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

910
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,621
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

911
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,336
You want that piece?

912
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,756
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

913
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,925
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

914
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,345
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

915
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,014
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

916
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,600
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

917
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:47,521
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

918
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:48,814
It's me and you.

919
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,734
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

920
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:08,834
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

921
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,544
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

922
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,546
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

923
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:13,756
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

924
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,049
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

925
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:20,763
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

926
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:21,930
Okay, so what?

927
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,141
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the internet.

928
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,934
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

929
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,102
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

930
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:31,023
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

931
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,360
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

932
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,029
See? So can I go home now?

933
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:39,364
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

934
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:43,202
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

935
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,621
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

936
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:49,333
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

937
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,168
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

938
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,545
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

939
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,507
Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...

940
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,217
- What did he say?
- What?

941
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,760
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

942
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,429
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

943
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,931
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

944
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,146
Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...

945
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,439
- Yeah!
- Call Sam.

946
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,107
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

947
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:15,526
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

948
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,153
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

949
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,905
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

950
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,578
I need you to stay here, all right?

951
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:27,746
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

952
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,914
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

953
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,040
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

954
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,250
Five minutes, all right?

955
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,753
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

956
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,839
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

957
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,590
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

958
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,968
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

959
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,763
...Then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

960
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,431
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

961
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,393
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

962
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:52,062
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

963
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,272
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

964
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:54,815
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

965
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,400
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

966
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,860
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

967
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,194
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

968
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,196
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

969
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:05,158
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

970
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,619
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

971
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:08,787
The...

972
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,125
I love you. God, I love you

973
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,960
just so much right now.

974
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,503
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

975
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,130
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

976
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,090
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

977
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,550
because you're such a swell guy.

978
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,801
One more thing, huh?

979
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,971
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

980
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,140
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

981
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:31,560
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

982
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,521
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

983
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,065
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

984
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,151
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

985
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,112
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

986
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,326
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

987
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:51,496
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

988
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,167
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

989
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,253
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

990
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,131
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

991
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,009
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

992
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:07,095
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

993
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,388
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

994
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,682
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

995
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,977
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

996
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,813
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

997
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:22,444
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

998
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,029
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

999
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,697
That's all it is.

1000
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,659
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1001
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:31,036
Okay, okay.

1002
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,873
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1003
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:39,670
Autobots, recon.

1004
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,174
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1005
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,009
Got some ice on his nose.

1006
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,553
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1007
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,055
You did not.

1008
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,308
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1009
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,728
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1010
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,440
Come on, come on.

1011
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,365
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1012
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,034
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1013
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:12,828
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1014
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,913
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1015
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,291
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1016
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:19,418
My glasses were in the bag.

1017
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,378
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1018
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,046
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1019
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,214
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1020
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,508
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1021
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:29,553
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1022
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,055
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1023
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,473
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1024
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,683
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

1025
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,143
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1026
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,937
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1027
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,981
I'm already stressed out enough.

1028
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,607
Okay. What now?

1029
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:48,405
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1030
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:52,325
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1031
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,577
Oh, God. Oh!

1032
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:57,831
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.

1033
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,292
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?

1034
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,420
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1035
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:06,465
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1036
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,175
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1037
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,342
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1038
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:10,677
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1039
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,763
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1040
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,347
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1041
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,016
We must have the glasses.

1042
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,684
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1043
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,020
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1044
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,229
Keep searching.

1045
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,981
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1046
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,316
Ten minutes. Okay?

1047
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,193
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1048
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,278
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1049
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,446
Calm down, calm down.

1050
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,239
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1051
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,992
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1052
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,869
Good? Good? Okay.

1053
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,245
- Move!
- Get away!

1054
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,039
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1055
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,041
He wants us to be quiet.

1056
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:48,673
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1057
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,636
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1058
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,638
How did you get over there so fast?

1059
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,474
Wow! That was tingly!

1060
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,977
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1061
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,859
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1062
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,906
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1063
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,492
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1064
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,327
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1065
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,996
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1066
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,164
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1067
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:23,166
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1068
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,417
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1069
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:25,585
How come the door's locked?

1070
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:29,339
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1071
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,632
You know he'll start counting

1072
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,008
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1073
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,218
Oh, dear.

1074
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,053
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1075
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:36,471
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1076
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:37,639
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1077
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,850
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1078
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:43,979
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1079
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:47,065
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1080
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,775
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1081
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,111
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1082
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,071
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1083
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,990
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1084
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,575
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1085
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:57,951
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1086
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,078
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1087
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,580
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1088
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:02,706
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1089
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,166
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1090
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,709
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

1091
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,252
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1092
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,713
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1093
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:14,301
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1094
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,137
- Judy.
- Was I...

1095
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,305
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

1096
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,723
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

1097
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:20,891
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1098
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,517
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

1099
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:25,437
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1100
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,191
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1101
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,109
- Happy time?
- ...my special alone time...

1102
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,277
- Stop.
- Mom.

1103
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:33,445
- Judy, stop.
- ...with myself.

1104
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,571
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1105
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,990
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1106
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,117
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1107
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,994
Oh, parents.

1108
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:44,748
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1109
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,377
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1110
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,005
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1111
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,215
Oh, I hate these.

1112
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,591
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

1113
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:55,717
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1114
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,385
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

1115
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,803
Can't you take safety seriously?

1116
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,182
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1117
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:05,185
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1118
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:13,777
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1119
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:16,404
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1120
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,740
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1121
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,533
Trashed. Gone.

1122
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,285
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1123
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,412
The parents are very irritating.

1124
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,248
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1125
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,084
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1126
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,377
What is with you?

1127
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,797
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1128
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,590
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1129
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,093
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1130
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,011
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1131
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,014
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1132
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:47,227
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1133
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,188
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1134
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:53,358
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1135
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:54,943
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1136
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,527
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1137
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,965
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1138
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,883
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1139
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,135
I want you to distract my parents

1140
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,554
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1141
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,062
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1142
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,148
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1143
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,400
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1144
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:38,069
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1145
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,321
It's Witwicky.

1146
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,657
May I enter the premises, sir?

1147
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,493
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1148
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,745
What the heck is going on here?

1149
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,997
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1150
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:51,333
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1151
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,834
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1152
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,002
That's right. National security.

1153
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,754
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1154
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,173
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1155
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,091
Could you stay off the grass?

1156
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:01,676
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1157
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:03,345
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1158
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,681
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1159
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,266
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1160
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:09,684
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1161
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:11,186
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1162
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,438
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1163
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,524
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1164
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,693
- No!
- What is this?

1165
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,529
How you doing, son?
ls your name Sam?

1166
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,114
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1167
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,449
Whoa, way out of line.

1168
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:28,620
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1169
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,622
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1170
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,790
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1171
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,041
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1172
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,377
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1173
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:38,213
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1174
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:42,217
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1175
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,552
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1176
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:47,263
I think direct contact.

1177
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,270
- Son?
- Yeah.

1178
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:58,233
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1179
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,448
Fourteen rads.

1180
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,493
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1181
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,162
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1182
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,914
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1183
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,582
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1184
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,584
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1185
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,006
So,

1186
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:26,928
LadiesMan217.

1187
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:30,432
That is your eBay username, right?

1188
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,851
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1189
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:34,018
What do you make of this?

1190
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:36,604
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...

1191
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:37,856
ls that you?

1192
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,108
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1193
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:45,113
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1194
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,783
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1195
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:53,288
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1196
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,540
- Really?
- ...from me, from my home,

1197
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,626
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1198
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,462
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1199
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:04,007
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1200
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,720
That's funny. That is so funny.

1201
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:11,347
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1202
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:15,310
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E.T.? No.

1203
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,895
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1204
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,146
You see this?

1205
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,815
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1206
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,651
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1207
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:24,986
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1208
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,489
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1209
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,658
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1210
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,911
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1211
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,412
What? Parole?

1212
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,832
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1213
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,918
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1214
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,753
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1215
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,004
You stole cars?

1216
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,756
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1217
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,674
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1218
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,093
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1219
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,846
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1220
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:57,602
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1221
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,021
It is time to talk!

1222
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,196
Big! It's big!

1223
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,911
Go, go, go, go!

1224
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,956
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1225
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,457
All right! All right!

1226
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,391
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1227
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:42,981
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1228
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,987
Taking the children was a bad move.

1229
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:52,490
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1230
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,829
Freeze!

1231
01:21:58,455 --> 01:21:59,914
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1232
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:03,585
Whoa!

1233
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,680
Hi, there.

1234
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:20,685
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1235
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:26,357
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1236
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,276
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1237
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,612
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1238
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,323
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1239
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,033
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1240
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,618
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1241
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:40,121
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1242
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:43,708
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1243
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,376
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1244
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,461
How you doing?

1245
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:48,296
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

1246
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,548
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1247
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,801
Now, listen. if I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1248
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:57,722
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1249
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:02,518
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1250
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,730
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1251
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,650
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1252
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:11,319
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1253
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,655
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1254
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,740
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1255
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,659
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1256
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,494
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1257
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:22,497
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1258
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:25,750
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1259
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,006
Hey!

1260
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:35,009
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1261
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,095
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1262
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:41,849
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1263
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,686
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1264
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:47,730
For threatening my dad.

1265
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:56,739
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1266
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,118
You're a criminal.

1267
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:03,621
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1268
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,875
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1269
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,043
All right.

1270
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:11,254
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1271
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:15,133
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1272
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,468
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1273
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:18,803
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1274
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:23,391
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1275
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,816
Optimus! incoming!

1276
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,783
Roll out.

1277
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:51,002
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.

1278
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:57,258
Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.

1279
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:58,760
Up you get.

1280
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,433
Okay, we're dropping in.

1281
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,023
Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.

1282
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,317
Ship one and two, come on in.

1283
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,029
That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.

1284
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:21,365
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.

1285
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,493
I got it. 12:00.

1286
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:28,998
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1287
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,170
Got him going down the street.

1288
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:42,345
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1289
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,847
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.

1290
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,391
Okay, we're coming around.

1291
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,666
Easy, you two.

1292
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:24,262
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1293
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,932
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1294
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,227
- Hold on!
- No!

1295
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:36,190
Sam!

1296
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,866
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.

1297
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,284
I'm in for the shot.

1298
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,785
Stop! Stop!

1299
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,788
Wait! No!

1300
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:56,794
- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.

1301
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:58,588
No!

1302
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:16,772
No! Stop!

1303
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:18,649
Stop!

1304
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,653
Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!

1305
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:24,989
What? Okay.

1306
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,076
Look, he's not fighting back!

1307
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,829
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1308
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,795
Stop hurting him!

1309
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,932
Don't let him move!

1310
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,184
I got him here!

1311
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:17,500
No!

1312
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,297
Happy to see me again?

1313
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,510
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1314
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:36,477
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1315
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,904
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1316
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,158
Optimus,

1317
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:55,913
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1318
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:59,750
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1319
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:02,670
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1320
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,018
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1321
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,269
in the western Pacific.

1322
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,521
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1323
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:23,441
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1324
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:30,614
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1325
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:32,033
of cruise missile range.

1326
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:35,703
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1327
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,788
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1328
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:45,212
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1329
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:48,591
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1330
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,221
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1331
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:00,478
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1332
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,980
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

1333
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,815
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1334
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,318
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1335
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,320
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1336
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,406
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1337
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:13,657
The blackout's global.

1338
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,577
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1339
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:21,165
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1340
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,467
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1341
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,846
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1342
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,434
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1343
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:42,686
you won't understand right away.

1344
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:46,107
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1345
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,610
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1346
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:54,532
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1347
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:59,954
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1348
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,832
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1349
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,960
This was classified above top secret.

1350
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,561
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1351
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:26,313
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1352
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:29,692
This is the image from Mars.

1353
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,237
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1354
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:35,156
from the base attack.

1355
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:39,034
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1356
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,663
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1357
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,749
Are we talking about an invasion?

1358
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,919
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1359
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:52,339
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1360
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,175
That's why the virus shut us down,

1361
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:57,595
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1362
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:02,224
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1363
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,439
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1364
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,942
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1365
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:15,362
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1366
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,449
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1367
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:31,879
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1368
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:33,088
Let's go!

1369
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,470
She's in here.

1370
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,555
What's going on?

1371
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,933
You're coming with me.

1372
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:47,061
- You're going to be my adviser.
- Me, too?

1373
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,396
Who's this?

1374
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:53,275
- He's my adviser.
- He comes, too.

1375
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:06,997
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1376
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:12,336
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1377
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:13,504
Wow.

1378
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,256
Who knew?

1379
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,941
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1380
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,496
Please, let this work.

1381
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,791
Fire it up, Optimus.

1382
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,210
The code.

1383
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:58,716
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1384
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:04,388
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1385
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:07,308
They must know it's here, as well.

1386
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:08,726
What about Bumblebee?

1387
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:12,896
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1388
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:16,984
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1389
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:21,322
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1390
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,408
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1391
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:29,163
They're a primitive and violent race.

1392
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,500
Were we so different?

1393
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:38,756
They're a young species.
They have much to learn.

1394
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,675
But I've seen goodness in them.

1395
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,929
Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.

1396
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:50,267
You all know there's only one way
to end this war.

1397
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:53,103
We must destroy the Cube.

1398
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:58,442
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1399
01:34:58,526 --> 01:34:59,860
That's suicide.

1400
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:03,781
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1401
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:08,369
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1402
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,789
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1403
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:15,959
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1404
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:19,797
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

1405
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:35,062
Team attention! Present arms!

1406
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:39,983
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1407
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,735
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1408
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,987
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1409
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,322
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1410
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:48,575
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1411
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:51,328
Hey, kid.

1412
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:54,998
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1413
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,667
You must be hungry?

1414
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,752
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1415
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:00,504
Where's my car?

1416
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:04,174
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1417
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,343
People can die here.

1418
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,430
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1419
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:10,764
Okay.

1420
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:14,601
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1421
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:19,356
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1422
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:24,027
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1423
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:25,362
Thank you.

1424
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:28,365
The man's an extortionist.

1425
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,702
All right, here's the situation.

1426
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:34,204
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1427
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:35,372
NBEs?

1428
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:39,042
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1429
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:42,838
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1430
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:53,849
Dear God. What is this?

1431
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,645
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1432
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:02,232
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1433
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:06,320
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1434
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,656
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1435
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,159
We call him NBE One.

1436
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,661
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1437
01:37:14,746 --> 01:37:17,164
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1438
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,250
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1439
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:23,670
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1440
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:27,257
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1441
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:28,759
in the history of mankind.

1442
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:31,845
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1443
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:38,769
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1444
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:42,689
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1445
01:37:43,233 --> 01:37:45,859
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1446
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:48,362
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1447
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:52,449
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1448
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:54,451
Well, you got one now.

1449
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:57,788
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1450
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,373
All Spark? What is that?

1451
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:02,042
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1452
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:06,964
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1453
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:09,466
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1454
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:12,636
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1455
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:14,304
That's their plan.

1456
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:16,807
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1457
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,436
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1458
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:23,981
Follow me.

1459
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:30,153
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1460
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:42,666
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1461
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,836
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1462
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:51,842
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1463
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,510
as well as NBE One.

1464
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:56,179
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1465
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:58,682
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1466
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:02,102
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1467
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:05,814
or any alien species on the outside.

1468
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:48,398
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1469
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,568
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1470
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:59,034
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1471
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,583
Oh, wow.

1472
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:08,752
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1473
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:10,045
Oh, no, man.

1474
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:14,675
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1475
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:17,678
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1476
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:22,265
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1477
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,767
I got a phone.

1478
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,606
Nokias are real nasty.

1479
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:34,111
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1480
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:37,030
Nokia's from Finland.

1481
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:41,743
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1482
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:50,085
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1483
01:41:03,683 --> 01:41:07,018
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1484
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:10,814
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1485
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,702
He's breaking the box.

1486
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:42,804
Go! Go! Go!

1487
01:41:42,889 --> 01:41:44,014
Move!

1488
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,192
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1489
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:57,277
Banachek. What's going on?

1490
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,237
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1491
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,405
- What?
- ...and the backup generator

1492
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,491
- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?

1493
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:10,624
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1494
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,125
I'll bring security to the...

1495
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:14,753
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1496
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:16,463
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1497
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:17,923
Let's go!

1498
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,841
They're popping our generators!

1499
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:33,230
Megatron melting!

1500
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:36,900
16502. We're losing pressure.

1501
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,194
Stand by! Set!

1502
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:41,363
We're losing pressure!

1503
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,908
The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!

1504
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:52,332
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1505
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,461
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1506
01:43:01,968 --> 01:43:04,636
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1507
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:05,762
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1508
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,806
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1509
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:09,641
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1510
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:11,017
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1511
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,477
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1512
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,563
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1513
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,439
Take him to his car!

1514
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:19,359
Drop it.

1515
01:43:21,112 --> 01:43:22,779
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1516
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,032
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1517
01:43:26,534 --> 01:43:28,285
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1518
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:29,411
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1519
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:31,705
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1520
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:32,998
S-Seven don't exist.

1521
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,875
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1522
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,211
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1523
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,465
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1524
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:46,636
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1525
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:53,101
All right. Okay.

1526
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:57,772
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1527
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:02,569
No, no!

1528
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:06,197
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1529
01:44:06,324 --> 01:44:09,868
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1530
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:12,495
Are you okay?

1531
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,416
They didn't hurt you, right?

1532
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:29,012
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1533
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,475
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1534
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:35,810
They're not gonna hurt you.

1535
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:39,439
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1536
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:42,817
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1537
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:44,444
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1538
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:09,970
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1539
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,449
Oh, my God.

1540
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:37,664
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1541
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:39,165
Let's get to it.

1542
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,293
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1543
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:43,795
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1544
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:45,171
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1545
01:45:45,256 --> 01:45:46,548
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1546
01:45:46,632 --> 01:45:47,757
Good! Right.

1547
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:50,593
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1548
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,762
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1549
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:54,723
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

1550
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:57,434
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1551
01:45:57,518 --> 01:45:58,977
In the alien archive, sir!

1552
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:01,062
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1553
01:46:01,147 --> 01:46:02,731
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1554
01:46:02,815 --> 01:46:05,233
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1555
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:07,110
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1556
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:08,862
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1557
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,905
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1558
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,574
Affirmative!

1559
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:16,494
Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.

1560
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:19,372
Check that backup system!

1561
01:46:19,457 --> 01:46:23,626
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1562
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:25,253
Come on! Get out of here!

1563
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:26,880
Heads up! Look out!

1564
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,258
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1565
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:33,803
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1566
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:46,608
I am Megatron!

1567
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:06,795
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1568
01:47:06,879 --> 01:47:07,921
Well, put the seat belt on.

1569
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:09,172
Pour it on him!

1570
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:24,938
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1571
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:27,440
Where is the Cube?

1572
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:29,609
The humans have taken it.

1573
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:36,825
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1574
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:38,743
Come on, Mags!

1575
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,329
Over here, sir!

1576
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,750
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1577
01:47:45,835 --> 01:47:48,294
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1578
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:53,675
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1579
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:55,677
Mikes?

1580
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:57,053
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1581
01:47:57,138 --> 01:47:58,721
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1582
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:00,348
Let's find them.

1583
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:01,933
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1584
01:48:02,017 --> 01:48:04,185
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1585
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:07,355
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1586
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:08,773
- Glen?
- Huh?

1587
01:48:08,858 --> 01:48:12,360
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1588
01:48:12,444 --> 01:48:13,486
What good is that?

1589
01:48:13,571 --> 01:48:15,989
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1590
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:19,659
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1591
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,578
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1592
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,883
There's Optimus.

1593
01:48:52,818 --> 01:48:54,319
Almost done.

1594
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:58,072
What the hell was that?

1595
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:02,827
Barricade the door!

1596
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:07,957
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1597
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:10,126
Six, five, four, six, three.

1598
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:17,175
Here! Put some rounds in!

1599
01:49:20,012 --> 01:49:21,471
Master search.

1600
01:49:22,348 --> 01:49:24,390
I got it! We're transmitting!

1601
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:25,642
Send exactly what I say!

1602
01:49:25,726 --> 01:49:29,854
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1603
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:33,983
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1604
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:35,652
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1605
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:38,363
What was that?

1606
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:41,324
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1607
01:49:43,452 --> 01:49:45,536
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1608
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:12,355
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1609
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:15,900
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1610
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:38,172
Oh, my God.

1611
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,036
Cool, Mom!

1612
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,938
This is so not good.

1613
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:56,292
He's behind the pillar!

1614
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:05,259
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

1615
01:52:08,305 --> 01:52:10,723
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1616
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:16,562
Sucker, burn!

1617
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:23,653
Oh, shit!

1618
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:25,988
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1619
01:52:27,157 --> 01:52:29,283
Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.

1620
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:32,745
Strike and Dark Star roll call.

1621
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:36,499
Looking out the right side.

1622
01:52:37,418 --> 01:52:39,627
Push to Kill Box One Alpha...

1623
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:50,763
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1624
01:52:50,848 --> 01:52:53,015
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1625
01:52:53,517 --> 01:52:55,768
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1626
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:58,187
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1627
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:01,607
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1628
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:04,610
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1629
01:53:04,695 --> 01:53:07,447
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1630
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:09,615
F-22 at 12:00.

1631
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,452
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1632
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:14,370
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1633
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:19,333
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1634
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,210
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1635
01:53:22,504 --> 01:53:23,713
We have you visual.

1636
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,716
Green smoke is the mark.

1637
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,219
Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.

1638
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:36,893
It's Starscream!

1639
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:39,020
Please tell me you copy.

1640
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:41,647
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1641
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:47,403
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1642
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:50,656
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1643
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,033
Incoming!

1644
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,935
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1645
01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:20,436
Clear the area!

1646
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:27,777
Oh, my God.

1647
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:31,572
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1648
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:33,282
Your legs.

1649
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:38,538
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1650
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,458
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1651
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:45,294
Ratchet!

1652
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:48,631
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1653
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:50,633
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1654
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:53,135
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1655
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:55,388
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1656
01:54:55,472 --> 01:54:58,307
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1657
01:54:59,476 --> 01:55:00,560
Come on!

1658
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:02,812
Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.

1659
01:55:04,565 --> 01:55:06,732
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1660
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:09,151
November Victor, 1 .2 clicks north.

1661
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:28,838
Move out! Let's go!

1662
01:55:35,178 --> 01:55:36,971
Let's go! Move!

1663
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,187
I'm not gonna leave you.

1664
01:56:24,311 --> 01:56:26,395
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1665
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:34,236
Oh, my God!

1666
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:48,709
Concentrate your fire!

1667
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:00,846
Come on. Come on.

1668
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:05,101
Megatron!

1669
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:13,442
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1670
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:19,365
Fall back!

1671
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:27,540
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1672
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:29,709
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1673
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,044
We need air cover down here now!

1674
01:57:38,051 --> 01:57:39,468
Sam, help me with this.

1675
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:47,935
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

1676
01:57:48,019 --> 01:57:50,146
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1677
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:52,523
No! I want two!

1678
01:57:54,109 --> 01:57:55,526
What's going on?

1679
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,989
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1680
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:03,117
Oh, these things just don't die.

1681
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,164
Oh, we're so dead.

1682
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:10,541
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1683
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:11,751
Where's the Cube?

1684
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:12,877
- Right there.
- Okay.

1685
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:14,044
And take that and wrap it around

1686
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:15,171
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1687
01:58:15,297 --> 01:58:17,965
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1688
01:58:19,342 --> 01:58:20,843
That building.

1689
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:26,390
- Okay.
- What?

1690
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:29,435
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1691
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:31,812
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1692
01:58:31,897 --> 01:58:34,106
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1693
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:36,150
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

1694
01:58:36,234 --> 01:58:40,654
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1695
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:42,990
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1696
01:58:43,074 --> 01:58:45,159
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1697
01:58:45,243 --> 01:58:46,786
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

1698
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,078
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

1699
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,873
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1700
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:53,417
Army Black Hawk requested.

1701
01:58:53,543 --> 01:58:56,045
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1702
01:58:56,171 --> 01:58:58,672
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1703
01:58:58,757 --> 01:59:01,884
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

1704
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:06,847
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

1705
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:14,939
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1706
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:20,820
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1707
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:24,198
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

1708
01:59:26,868 --> 01:59:29,036
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1709
01:59:35,418 --> 01:59:36,752
Watch out!

1710
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,344
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1711
01:59:45,428 --> 01:59:47,137
Get out of here now!

1712
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:16,125
Megatron!

1713
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:17,418
Prime.

1714
02:00:43,153 --> 02:00:45,237
Humans don't deserve to live.

1715
02:00:45,322 --> 02:00:48,032
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1716
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:50,826
Then you will die with them!

1717
02:00:56,499 --> 02:00:58,959
Join them in extinction!

1718
02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:19,813
Keep moving, Sam!

1719
02:01:20,815 --> 02:01:22,191
Don't stop!

1720
02:01:38,166 --> 02:01:39,208
No!

1721
02:01:54,391 --> 02:01:56,517
Sam, get to the building!

1722
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:06,568
Give me that Cube, boy!

1723
02:02:19,124 --> 02:02:21,291
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1724
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:46,108
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1725
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:54,575
I smell you, boy!

1726
02:03:06,755 --> 02:03:07,963
Maggot!

1727
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,525
Oh, no!

1728
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:54,927
I'll drive! You shoot!

1729
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:17,199
This isn't going well!

1730
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:18,700
Shoot! Shoot!

1731
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:05,789
Nice shot.

1732
02:05:05,915 --> 02:05:09,334
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

1733
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:20,929
Hey!

1734
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:27,811
Hey! I'm over here!

1735
02:05:40,116 --> 02:05:41,867
We've got the boy.

1736
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:47,873
Watch out!

1737
02:05:48,208 --> 02:05:49,458
Missile!

1738
02:05:59,886 --> 02:06:01,386
Hang on, Sam!

1739
02:06:10,063 --> 02:06:11,438
No! No!

1740
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:22,199
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1741
02:06:35,713 --> 02:06:37,214
Where do I go?

1742
02:06:38,508 --> 02:06:42,511
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1743
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:45,430
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1744
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:52,062
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1745
02:06:52,146 --> 02:06:54,982
Oh, so unwise.

1746
02:07:06,911 --> 02:07:08,453
I got you, boy.

1747
02:07:10,206 --> 02:07:12,040
Hold on to the Cube!

1748
02:07:31,686 --> 02:07:34,604
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

1749
02:07:39,569 --> 02:07:40,652
Sam?

1750
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:48,160
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1751
02:07:48,828 --> 02:07:50,329
No sacrifice,

1752
02:07:51,664 --> 02:07:54,791
- no victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron,

1753
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:57,627
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1754
02:07:58,004 --> 02:08:01,214
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1755
02:08:01,674 --> 02:08:03,175
Get behind me.

1756
02:08:04,844 --> 02:08:07,429
It's you and me, Megatron.

1757
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:10,474
No, it's just me, Prime.

1758
02:08:12,852 --> 02:08:18,023
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1759
02:08:23,404 --> 02:08:28,283
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1760
02:08:47,387 --> 02:08:49,846
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1761
02:08:49,931 --> 02:08:52,391
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1762
02:08:52,475 --> 02:08:53,558
Hey.

1763
02:08:54,727 --> 02:08:56,895
Bring the rain. All right?

1764
02:08:57,271 --> 02:08:59,314
All right, let's kill these things.

1765
02:09:01,234 --> 02:09:02,859
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

1766
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:04,945
Armor's weak under the chest.

1767
02:09:14,997 --> 02:09:16,581
Target marked. Still waiting.

1768
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,750
Time on target, 20 seconds.

1769
02:09:25,633 --> 02:09:27,759
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1770
02:09:32,974 --> 02:09:34,433
Move out!

1771
02:09:37,645 --> 02:09:38,937
Incoming!

1772
02:09:47,447 --> 02:09:49,573
Weapons armed. Status green.

1773
02:10:08,176 --> 02:10:10,051
Run! Move!

1774
02:10:17,518 --> 02:10:19,102
Second wave's on approach.

1775
02:10:22,565 --> 02:10:24,191
What is that? Break off!

1776
02:10:24,275 --> 02:10:26,776
- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...

1777
02:10:35,495 --> 02:10:37,662
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!

1778
02:10:41,709 --> 02:10:43,752
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.

1779
02:10:44,086 --> 02:10:45,504
Take him out!

1780
02:10:59,685 --> 02:11:01,061
Two's down!

1781
02:11:10,446 --> 02:11:12,447
I'll kill you!

1782
02:11:12,532 --> 02:11:15,283
Mine! All Spark!

1783
02:11:16,244 --> 02:11:19,120
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1784
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:20,956
Sam!

1785
02:11:21,707 --> 02:11:22,958
No, Sam!

1786
02:11:48,734 --> 02:11:49,943
Hold up.

1787
02:11:52,989 --> 02:11:55,991
You left me no choice, brother.

1788
02:12:05,585 --> 02:12:08,503
Sam, I owe you my life.

1789
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:11,339
We are in your debt.

1790
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:33,278
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1791
02:12:34,113 --> 02:12:35,447
Jazz.

1792
02:12:38,618 --> 02:12:40,869
We lost a great comrade

1793
02:12:42,163 --> 02:12:44,039
but gained new ones.

1794
02:12:44,290 --> 02:12:46,625
Thank you, all of you.

1795
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:49,336
You honor us with your bravery.

1796
02:12:50,338 --> 02:12:52,339
Permission to speak, sir?

1797
02:12:52,798 --> 02:12:55,717
Permission granted, old friend.

1798
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:57,302
You speak now?

1799
02:12:58,179 --> 02:13:00,305
I wish to stay with the boy.

1800
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:03,016
If that is his choice.

1801
02:13:07,897 --> 02:13:09,064
Yes.

1802
02:13:29,585 --> 02:13:34,381
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1803
02:13:34,882 --> 02:13:37,926
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1804
02:13:38,552 --> 02:13:41,846
The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,

1805
02:13:41,931 --> 02:13:44,099
deepest place on our planet.

1806
02:13:44,266 --> 02:13:47,852
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

1807
02:13:47,937 --> 02:13:50,188
would crush and entomb them,

1808
02:13:51,941 --> 02:13:53,692
leaving no evidence.

1809
02:14:00,282 --> 02:14:04,744
With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.

1810
02:14:06,455 --> 02:14:09,082
And fate has yielded its reward,

1811
02:14:10,584 --> 02:14:13,545
a new world to call home.

1812
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:23,972
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,

1813
02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:26,891
but watching over them in secret,

1814
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:29,728
waiting, protecting.

1815
02:14:31,063 --> 02:14:34,149
I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.

1816
02:14:34,734 --> 02:14:37,736
And though we are worlds apart,

1817
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:42,782
like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.

1818
02:14:44,285 --> 02:14:46,828
I am Optimus Prime

1819
02:14:47,163 --> 02:14:50,582
and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots

1820
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:53,668
taking refuge among the stars.

1821
02:14:54,670 --> 02:14:56,463
We are here.

1822
02:14:57,006 --> 02:14:59,090
We are waiting.

1823
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:23,364
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1824
02:15:26,368 --> 02:15:31,873
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1825
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:34,375
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1826
02:15:34,710 --> 02:15:37,212
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1827
02:15:37,296 --> 02:15:38,963
The government would let us know.

1828
02:15:39,131 --> 02:15:40,715
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

1829
02:15:40,841 --> 02:15:43,301
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1830
02:15:43,385 --> 02:15:44,969
because there's no secrets.

1831
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:47,222
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1832
02:15:57,233 --> 02:16:00,568
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
