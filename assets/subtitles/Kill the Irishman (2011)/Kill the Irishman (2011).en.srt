2
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,609
That all you got?

3
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,807
It's gonna take more than
a few firecrackers to kill Danny Greene.

4
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,726
The Cadillac, it was Danny Greene's.

5
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,489
Put a 24-hour tail on him.

6
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,486
The Irish have this expression,
"He's a man you don't meet every day. "

7
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,411
That was Danny, ah' right.

8
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,523
We both grew up on the east side,
in Collinwood.

9
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,447
Danny was an orphan.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,320
He was raised by his grandfather
in a dump on Waterloo Road.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,608
He was a good athlete.
Made All-Metro in basketball and baseball.

12
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,322
School held no interest.

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,604
Danny was already marching
to a different tune.

14
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,407
Back then everything in Cleveland
was controlled by the Mafia,

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,003
which had been run since the '40s
by one man. John Scalish.

16
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,281
Every day after school, it was Danny
and his friend Billy McComber

17
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,006
against this one group of Sicilian kids.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,731
I don't know why they hated Danny so much.

19
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,647
You know what they say, "Kids will be kids."

20
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,089
As for me, I joined
Cleveland P.D. at age 18.

21
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,288
After 12 years, I made detective,

22
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,404
investigating organised crime
on the Lake Erie shore.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,446
All right, listen up, men.
Grainbarten.

24
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,487
Here.

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,648
- Nungester, William.
- Here!

26
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,922
- Harlet, Roger.
- Here!

27
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,170
- Heuler, Leo.
- Here.

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,289
Walton, William. Greene, Daniel.

29
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,846
Sneperger, Arthur. Walter, George.
McComber, William.

30
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,561
Great. it's only 91.

31
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,727
Wait till noon.

32
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,130
What is that?

33
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,601
It's one of those container ships
out of New Orleans.

34
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,365
They're gonna put us all out of business.

35
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,966
- And who told you that? Danny?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,490
Where's he learn that shit?

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,567
He reads.

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,326
I read.

39
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,690
Comics don't count, Art.

40
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,322
- You got him?
- Yeah, ready?

41
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,049
Turn that thing off!

42
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,285
What's this all about?

43
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,081
You know the rules.
Temperature hits 110, we're done.

44
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,245
I got a contract to unload these barges by
close of day, and I will fulfil that contract.

45
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,170
Someone's gonna die in there.

46
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,969
Who? Him?

47
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,568
Looks fine to me. In the pink.

48
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,568
If you wanna continue working in this union,
quit your belly-achin'

49
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,329
and get back up there.

50
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,881
Come on, Danny.

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,045
Ice him down.

52
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,804
You know, Danny, we at the national chapter
don't support Brooke.

53
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,407
He doesn't care about the rank and file,
and that's a problem.

54
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,405
You ever think about running against him?

55
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,529
Union president?
I don't know, Mr Gilroy.

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,166
The guys look up to you. I've seen it.

57
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,484
I didn't even finish high school.

58
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,530
So what?
You read the entire Library of Congress.

59
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,125
Think about it.

60
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,760
Here you are, boys.

61
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,330
- I'm Art.
- I'm Billy.

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,925
Hi, Art. Hi, Billy.

63
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,204
Who's your friend?

64
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,490
No, no, don't bother. He doesn't like girls.

65
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,285
What you got there?

66
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,891
A little light reading, huh?

67
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,407
Yeah.

68
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,884
- My family's from Kildare.
- Nice.

69
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,487
Your friends said that you don't like girls.

70
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,841
They're being ironic.

71
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,007
Gotcha.

72
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,885
You know where you say
the opposite for laughs?

73
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,970
Well, I think that you are
the ugliest man on Lake Erie

74
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,122
and I'd rather kiss Richard Nixon.

75
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,046
Got that?

76
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,561
Why don't you read that?

77
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,130
I never do this. Really.

78
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,802
What makes me so special?

79
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,603
'Cause you're different
than all those idiots.

80
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,690
Danny. I'm in trouble.
I'm in really big trouble.

81
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,847
Go.

82
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,526
It's in there.

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,207
Wait here.

84
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,562
I'm a friend of Art Sneperger's.

85
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,486
Oh, yeah?
Well, Sneperger's got no friends here.

86
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,247
Come over here.

87
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,290
Well, it looks like your friend owes us
a lot of money.

88
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,447
He can't pay.

89
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,845
You came here to John Nardi's casino
to tell him that your friend can't pay?

90
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,001
You know who he is?

91
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,681
Everyone in Cleveland knows
who John Nardi is.

92
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,087
I got a proposition.

93
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,288
You believe this fuckin' guy?

94
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,209
Well, let's hear what he's gotta say.

95
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,768
- I took care of it.
- What?

96
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
I want one thing in return.

97
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,204
You gotta promise me
you'll never gamble again.

98
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,321
- Yeah.
- Can you do that, Art?

99
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,523
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
Jesus, Danny!

101
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,162
- Promise me!
- I promise.

102
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,121
Get outta here.

103
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,127
Okay.

104
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,569
Good call, Danny.
This place is like Sears and Roebuck.

105
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,527
We got one more.

106
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,368
I think there's four more rotisseraries.

107
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,962
Mr Greene. A word with you, please.

108
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,965
What can I do?

109
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,804
Tell me, what can I do for you?

110
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,961
Resign.

111
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,845
That's out of the question.

112
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,566
Then I'll run against you.

113
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,121
Runnin' ploughs on a grain ship's one thing.

114
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,968
Running a union is quite another.

115
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,886
Think you're moving up? New career?

116
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,091
I don't think so.

117
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,404
I think you're gonna tell Mr Gilroy
you're not interested.

118
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,248
And then you're gonna pay me half
of what you been making

119
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
with your Wop friends in the container yard.

120
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,083
Oh, I didn't know about that either?

121
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,403
I got no moral issues with it, mind you.
I just want my cut.

122
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,126
But next time,

123
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,610
the Cleveland P.D.
will pay a visit to your house.

124
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,969
Oh, they're my friends, too.

125
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
And then it's over.

126
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,611
You won't work in any union anywhere.

127
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,565
You won't exist.

128
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll come to your house
and drink all your beer.

129
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,766
I'll visit your
girlfriend in the back bedroom.

130
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,202
And you, sir, will take it.

131
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,884
Because you have to.

132
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,164
Be in the machine shop at midnight.
I'll send my man to pick up the cash.

133
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,122
Now get the fuck out of my office.

134
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,724
A gun?

135
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,570
You Polack prick.

136
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,164
What do you do
if a Polack throws a hand grenade at you?

137
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,209
Take the pin out and throw it back.

138
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,931
You hear how the Polish firing squad died?

139
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,441
Stood in a circle.

140
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,403
Come on, Joe, let's dance.

141
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,806
Joe Buka!

142
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
Joe's not here.

143
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,362
I'll give you three seconds...

144
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,201
To do what?

145
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,326
To do what?

146
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,807
Go ahead, yank it.

147
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,046
Get out.

148
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,010
To the new president!

149
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,525
This place is a dump.
Clean up the freight yard.

150
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,168
And replace those signs.
I'm sick to death of looking at them.

151
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,928
- Repaint these goddamn stairs.
- What colour do you want?

152
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,327
Green.

153
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,361
Styner, Barley. Holt, Richard.

154
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,083
Harlet, Roger.

155
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,169
Pitsford, Harold.

156
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,088
Stockbarge. Manscoter, Harold.

157
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,443
Mr MacLeish. Danny Greene.

158
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,291
I know who you are.
You're the tool that sent me this.

159
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,449
Four thousand to unload each vessel?

160
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,888
Are you out of your fucking mind?
The price is 2,000.

161
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,162
We have a contract
and you're going to honour it.

162
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,890
Or I'm gonna lock out your union.

163
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,281
Is that clear, you fucking potato eater?

164
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,087
Potato eater.

165
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,640
Seeing as how the potato
was the only source of nutrition

166
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,610
in Ireland for 300 years
and half the population,

167
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,843
including my ancestors,
died in the great famine,

168
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,204
I'd say that term is insensitive.

169
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,851
Speaking of culinary tastes,
Mr MacLeish, you're Scottish, aren't you?

170
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,211
Let's talk about haggis.

171
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,608
Haggis is seasoned lard
stuffed into a sheep's colon.

172
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,881
Sol may be a potato-eater, Mr MacLeish, but
I don't eat fat out of a sheep's asshole.

173
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,645
What do you think of the new carpet?

174
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,689
After all these years I had lost track
of Danny Greene.

175
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,571
You can imagine my surprise
when I heard a guy by the same name

176
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,450
had been elected president
of the Longshoreman's Union.

177
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,487
This is John Scalish.

178
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,206
And I wondered if it was the same guy
from my neighbourhood.

179
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,409
Yeah, same guy.

180
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,484
It was only a matter of time before he
started hanging out at that Theatrical Grill.

181
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,722
Every city's got a Theatrical.

182
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,561
The one place where crooks and cops
sit side-by-side.

183
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,404
Mr Greene wants you to know he appreciates

184
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,244
the fine job Cleveland P.D. are doing.

185
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,765
He wants to pick up your tab.

186
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,607
Tell Mr Greene that Cleveland P.D.
will pick up its own tab

187
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,287
to avoid any look of impropriety.
But thank you.

188
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,369
He said no.
Something about impropriety.

189
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,284
Now you are a beauty.

190
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,325
But I told you.

191
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,686
Come here.

192
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,322
He's not bothering you, is he, huh?

193
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,805
Thank you, Artie.

194
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,370
Detective Manditski?
Steve Marshack with the newspaper.

195
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,249
Can I talk to you for a minute?

196
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,484
Yeah, I know who you are, Mr Marshack.
I read your column. What can I do for you?

197
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,723
Somebody told me you played hoops
against Danny Greene in high school.

198
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,767
Is that true?

199
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,286
Was he really the best player at Metro East?

200
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,725
Second best.

201
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,242
So you're gonna do a story on Danny?

202
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,211
Went from rags to riches, from orphan
to union president? Something like that?

203
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,330
Well, we're gonna do a story on him, all
right, just not the kind he's going to like.

204
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,687
- Call this a heads up.
- Thank you.

205
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,040
Danny, aren't you coming?

206
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,161
No.

207
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,730
I'm not going anywhere without you.

208
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,970
They don't want you, Billy.

209
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,887
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

210
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,484
A 12-count indictment has been returned

211
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,722
by a Cuyahoga County grand jury

212
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,565
against labour leader Daniel Patrick Greene.

213
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,725
Greene, arrested last Tuesday
is charged with multiple counts

214
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,122
of grand larceny, extortion
and labour racketeering.

215
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,406
All right.

216
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,800
Is it true?

217
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,127
All of it?

218
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,204
I paid the lawyer.

219
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,002
We don't have any money left.

220
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,366
Sell the house.

221
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,090
The house? Where are we gonna go?

222
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,127
We'll find somewhere next week.

223
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,007
We?

224
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,563
Excuse me. You're in jail.

225
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,365
No testifying?

226
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,481
No testifying. We drop the extortion
and labour racketeering charges.

227
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,891
It's 10 years.

228
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,123
You plead guilty to two counts
of falsifying financial records

229
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,487
and agree to a lifetime ban from the union.

230
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,245
That's what I get.
Fuck you. What do you get?

231
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,041
Well, the Bureau knows very little
about organised crime in Northern Ohio.

232
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,604
So talk to us, say once a month.
Tell us what you hear.

233
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,765
I can do that.

234
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,282
Feds just released Danny Greene.

235
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,605
I win again.

236
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,768
- I won again.
- I won.

237
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,810
I wanna ride.

238
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,770
We can't live here.

239
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,321
It'll have to do.

240
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,049
What are you gonna do for work?

241
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,726
It's America. Land of opportunity.

242
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,444
John Nardi, please.
Tell him it's Danny Greene.

243
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,688
He's got the best restaurant in town.

244
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,250
He runs the cleanest numbers.

245
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,401
Now everybody wants to play
Shondor's numbers. The Irish. Polacks.

246
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,370
Even the Shiser, Edie Stewart.
She doesn't discriminate.

247
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,610
Get yourself a job.

248
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,485
You like stroganoff?

249
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,244
Danny, taste that.

250
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,564
More salt, I think.

251
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,362
I have to tell you how impressed I am
with how you handled your recent adversity.

252
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,283
I provide a unique financial service
to men who like to gamble.

253
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,806
Before your time,
gamblers borrowed money from casinos.

254
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,521
The problem was if a gambler skipped town,
the casino had no recourse.

255
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,209
So I started to offer a six-for-five, meaning
you borrow five, you owe six within a week.

256
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,569
If you don't pay,
you get charged 30% interest, figure-ish.

257
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,202
Now all this was perfectly legal.

258
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,046
And the best part,
Iran my own debt collection.

259
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,680
Then, in its wisdom, the federal government
labelled such practices "loan sharking",

260
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,809
which is a stupid term.

261
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,849
Come here, I wanna show you something.

262
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,361
Joey.

263
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,964
Honey, what happened?

264
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,204
The wife let you out of the doghouse
finally. Eat something. Enjoy.

265
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,489
Cuyahoga County DA.

266
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,487
Where was I?

267
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,963
Yes. The two of them running
like their collection had been incarcerated.

268
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,966
Is this a position
that would interest you, Danny?

269
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,603
A man's gotta work, Mr Birns.

270
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,524
So many young people
don't understand that these days.

271
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,129
I swear I don't have it.

272
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,567
I swear I don't have it. I swear.
I swear I don't have it.

273
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,528
Agent Malloy will be with you
in just a moment, Mr Greene.

274
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,366
Danny. How you doing?

275
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,680
Hanging in there.

276
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,929
You got anything for us?

277
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,287
Well, nothing of interest.

278
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,610
Danny Greene, huh?

279
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,809
How about you tell Shondor Birns
that I get Shorty's money first, baby.

280
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,881
Second.

281
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,689
Hey, baby, I can deal with that.

282
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,480
Here, take this.

283
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,641
No, thanks.

284
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Tell Shondor sorry I was light last month.

285
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,841
Giants plus seven against the Eagles.
it's a lock, right? Wrong.

286
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,011
I'm Mike Frato, by the way.

287
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,605
Nice truck, Mike.

288
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,331
Thanks. I was hauling gravel
till I discovered garbage.

289
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,210
Big money in garbage. I highly recommend it.

290
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,091
You like what you do?

291
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,525
Yeah. Sure.

292
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,242
It's good to like what you do.
Keeps the blood pressure down.

293
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,890
Nice Caddy, by the way.

294
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,004
My wife met his wife Joan Greene
at a church luncheon. They hit it off

295
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,929
That made things a little awkward.

296
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,123
Thanks, Clare. Thank you.

297
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,205
Bye. Thank you.

298
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,164
See you next Sunday.

299
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,208
Well, you missed an excellent sermon.

300
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,771
What the hell is this?

301
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,126
Joe and his wife gave us a lift.

302
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,770
Joe and his wife.

303
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,364
Father Kilden said it would be nice
if you came to one of his services.

304
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,921
You know, sometime this decade.

305
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,686
...to take the oath of induction...

306
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,001
Never should have taken away
this guy's title.

307
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,366
He wouldn't go to Vietnam.

308
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,885
I wouldn't go if I were drafted.

309
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,362
Why stick our nose in Vietnam?

310
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,011
English been doing that to the Irish
for 2,000 years.

311
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,287
And by the way?
How we gonna pay for it, huh?

312
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,328
Deficit spending, my ass.

313
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,444
Next thing you know
we'll be going off the gold standard.

314
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,010
The country's going to hell.

315
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,969
So is kids smoking pot.

316
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,010
If I were President, I'd
legalize the stuff and tax the sales of it,

317
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,206
like booze and cigarettes.

318
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,647
In two years' time
we'd be richer than Ken Croesus is.

319
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,644
Danny, the game. it's the Packers.

320
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,127
Go ahead.

321
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,091
You got anything to eat other than that?

322
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,931
That's Grade-A sirloin chuck.

323
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,682
We got no vegetables, no fruit, no nuts.

324
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,648
The stuff's got too much cholesterol.

325
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,081
What's cholesterol?

326
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,131
Party's over.

327
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,887
You got five minutes to clear out.

328
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,247
Party ain't over.

329
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,210
You show yourself here again,
I'm coming over there.

330
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,007
And I'm knocking all your teeth out.

331
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,120
And I'm fucking that hot little wife of
yours all night long while you watch.

332
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,481
Come on.

333
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,961
Come on, stupid, move! Come on!

334
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,091
Get him, Danny!

335
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,927
Come on, Danny!

336
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,766
Tell Licavoli we're sorry. You're
on my level, so mind your p's and q's.

337
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,488
You're the only Wop I can stand, Johnny.
You know that, right?

338
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
Just be respectful.

339
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,766
Jack.

340
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,801
Leo. You remember Danny Greene.

341
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,406
Of course.

342
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,166
How you doing, Danny?

343
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,526
Here. Sit down, Danny.

344
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,888
Well, somebody say something?

345
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,766
Why am I here, John?

346
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,083
Well, we wanna talk about garbage.
You know, we wanna give you a hand.

347
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,124
You decided we need a hand.

348
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,490
You know, Jack, you've been trying to get
the union off the ground for five years.

349
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,364
So you came here to tell us we're fuck-ups,
that it, John?

350
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,330
Now why do you have to talk to me...
Why does he have to talk to me like that?

351
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,244
I came here to do you a favour
and you're breaking my balls.

352
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,966
What do you propose, John?

353
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,529
We bring Danny in the mix.

354
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,890
Didn't you talk to Shondor?

355
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,328
Shondor Birns says you been
doing a good job for him.

356
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,644
And that thing
with the Longshoreman Union,

357
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,449
you handled yourself real well.

358
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,846
Thank you.

359
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,287
A guy who keeps his mouth shut
is a stand-up guy.

360
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,204
What do you say?

361
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,970
All right. You got my blessing.

362
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,327
Be prepared, huh?

363
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,170
These garbage hauliers are tough nuts.

364
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,969
Some of these guys...

365
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,085
There's no talking to them, you know.
Believe me, we tried.

366
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,130
With all due respect, Jack,
that was you talking to them, not me.

367
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,043
Wait a minute.
When you speak to Mr Licavoli...

368
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,408
I guarantee you,
you're not gonna be disappointed, all right?

369
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,683
The garbage hauling plan was Danny's
golden opportunity to get back in the game.

370
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,128
The only problem was he knew
next to nothing about garbage hauling.

371
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,405
So he found someone who did.

372
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,610
Former Golden Glove champion
of Cleveland, half-Lithuanian, half-Irish.

373
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,968
He'd been clearing out bars
down on the dock since the 10th grade.

374
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,487
Keith Ritson.

375
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,403
There's a million houses in Northern Ohio.

376
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,210
You know who collects the garbage?

377
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,566
Two hundred separate companies,
that's who.

378
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,567
It's chaos out there, no good to anybody.

379
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,725
It's going to be next to impossible
to organise these guys.

380
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,605
You got any new ideas?

381
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,765
We hold a recruitment drive.

382
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,005
I'll join! I'll join! I'll join!

383
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,121
What?

384
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,964
I know what you are.

385
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,763
Mrs O'Keefe.

386
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,604
Don't you start with me, you hear?

387
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,567
You got guys coming round here all hours
of the day or night doing God knows what.

388
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,290
You misunderstand.

389
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,850
Oh, I understand.

390
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,364
But I ain't afraid of you.

391
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,247
Now get the hell off my gate
before I stop being polite.

392
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,124
Hey, Danny. How are you, my friend?

393
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,808
- it's good to see you. How's everything?
- All good.

394
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,531
Be careful. It could
get a little hairy in here sometimes.

395
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,964
What'd I tell you, right?
it's like this every day.

396
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,602
At first, I didn't want to have kids.
Babies, diapers... But shit happens.

397
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,651
My wife still looks pretty good, you know.
I got a hot salami. What can I say?

398
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,362
To what do I owe this privilege, my friend?

399
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,809
Jack Licavoli sent me.

400
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,969
I should have fucking known.

401
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,805
Okay, cut to the chase. You know what?

402
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,646
Fuck Licavoli. Fuck Lips Moceri.
And all due respect, fuck you, too.

403
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,722
- Calm down, Mike.
- No, I ain't calming down.

404
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,006
I don't wanna join a union.

405
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,242
I don't give a fuck
how many friends they got in New York.

406
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,120
I built this company from scratch,
up to my neck in shit every day!

407
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,488
And I didn't work my balls off
so somebody else can just fucking walk in!

408
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,168
You tell those guys
they can't fucking muscle me.

409
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,130
That's right.
I got all the muscle I need right here.

410
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,328
And that means you, too, Danny.

411
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,770
All I'm saying is it sets a precedent.

412
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,571
This here guy says no,
others will follow suit.

413
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,848
Are you friends with Frato, Danny?
Is that the problem?

414
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,044
More like acquaintances. But I like the guy.

415
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,005
Well, the fat fuck, he was given a choice.

416
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,084
And now he's gotta deal
with the consequences.

417
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,367
Hang on a sec.
I think I got a say in this.

418
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,885
"A say in this"?

419
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,091
No, you don't, John.

420
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,484
This is my union.

421
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,003
Well, fuck you very much.

422
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,882
Wait a minute. Is there a problem here?

423
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,610
You know, 10 years ago, Scalish,
he divided up the unions.

424
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,243
Now you got yours, I got mine.

425
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,002
Let's not come down
with a sudden case of amnesia.

426
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,081
You know, we did all the work.

427
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,321
Wait, wait. I didn't get that, John.
What? What?

428
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,402
I said, we did all the work!

429
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,562
You're trying to take over my action.

430
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,288
That's it, isn't it?
You greedy, fucking prick.

431
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,330
Come on, look. I'm not trying to take over
anything. I'm just saying...

432
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,482
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know what you're saying.

433
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,171
We're gonna have a sit-down
with Scalish over this, all right?

434
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,050
We're gonna take this up later.

435
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,644
Mike Frato is a dead man.

436
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,649
Now either you make it happen,
or Lips and Vic will.

437
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,925
Can you do this thing, Danny?

438
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,368
Frato's got 10 kids, John. Ten.

439
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,240
I don't care.

440
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,562
You gave him a reasonable option.
He crapped in your face.

441
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,243
You said you wanted to be in the bigs.

442
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,686
Sometimes you gotta do things
that you don't like.

443
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,448
You gotta make Frato go away.

444
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,485
Don't you disappoint me.

445
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,403
It's got a 50-yard radius lens.

446
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,484
It works on one of those garage doors
or on those TV changers.

447
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,891
And a transmitter.

448
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,683
Sends a command
from the remote to the receiver.

449
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,445
It's lights out, lads.
It's fucking lights out.

450
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,204
Good, Keith. Good.

451
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,086
So when?

452
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,891
Friday night.

453
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,320
I'll put you right through
to Agent Malloy, Mr Greene.

454
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,490
Got something for you, Danny.

455
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,688
One of your guys was picked up
by the City P.D.

456
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,410
They're talking about making a deal.

457
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,687
Who?

458
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,485
Art Sneperger.

459
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,967
He was boosting a Mercedes
in Shaker Heights.

460
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,247
He said it was to pay down a gambling debt.

461
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,526
I don't believe it. Art doesn't gamble.

462
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,088
There's 10 blackjack dealers
in Youngstown who'll disagree.

463
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,008
Anyway, I just thought
I would keep you in the loop.

464
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,610
I wanted to talk to you about something...

465
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,325
Hey, what's going on?

466
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,211
Mike Frato tonight.

467
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,645
You said Friday.

468
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,210
Changed my mind.

469
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,770
But it's Halloween.

470
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,286
Were you going trick or treating, Art?

471
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,929
What are you doing? Why isn't Keith...

472
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,160
Christ.

473
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,165
Danny, is everything all right?

474
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,971
Yeah. Why? Get going.

475
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,646
Maybe we could talk to him.

476
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,208
I mean, I've known the guy my whole life.

477
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,167
He'll rat us out, Danny. Do it.

478
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,769
I told you not to gamble, Art.

479
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,568
What's going on? I heard voices.

480
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,970
Go back to sleep.

481
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,527
Here's your paper.

482
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,127
You fuck! You slimy mick fuck!

483
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,931
You sent a guy to my house!
To my fucking house!

484
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,764
- it's not how it looks, Mike!
- "it's not how it looks"?

485
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,524
You lying fucking prick.

486
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,802
You shot Mikey! Jesus Christ.
What the fuck, Mikey?

487
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,000
What the fuck?

488
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,407
Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.

489
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,248
Come on! Don't do that!

490
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,525
Police theorising
believe Frato 's getting off three shots.

491
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,888
Greene returned one shot
from about 25 feet away

492
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,088
described by police as a lucky shot,

493
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,764
hitting Frato in the head.

494
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,241
Danny, did you do it?
Can you tell me who did it?

495
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,765
Give him some room.

496
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,081
- For the fifth time...
- No, it's the fourth, actually.

497
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,323
I was at the municipal park like I am
every morning doing my pushups,

498
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,926
when I see Mike Frato
coming at me in a Cadillac.

499
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,731
Okay. It wasn't Mike Frato's car.
How'd you know it was him?

500
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,201
I could smell him.

501
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,800
The same Mike Frato who refused
to join your union.

502
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,882
I'm barred for life from the unions,
remember?

503
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,646
The same Mike Frato whose car
was blown up by your former associate,

504
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,210
Art Sneperger.

505
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,170
Doesn't sound very good, does it?

506
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,241
It's not gonna sound very good
to a jury, either.

507
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,726
- So what do you want from me?
- The truth.

508
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,245
I told you the truth.

509
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,641
Did you tell me
that Danny Greene murdered Mike Frato?

510
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,491
Hey, don't put fucking words in my mouth.
I never said that. I said no.

511
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,289
Then you didn't tell me the truth.

512
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,848
Let me tell you something.

513
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,731
I ain't going before the grand jury.
And I ain't testifying.

514
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,689
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
- I don't give a shit what you tell me.

515
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,966
- No, I'm not.
- I could subpoena you.

516
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,565
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Throw up.

517
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,324
Throw up all over yourself.
I'll help you clean it up.

518
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,811
Just tell me what I need to know.

519
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,451
Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth, Mikey.

520
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,681
Okay. This is how it went down.

521
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,089
Mike went to kill Danny Greene.

522
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,527
He threw a couple of shots at him,
Danny shot back.

523
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,249
That's it. Case closed.

524
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,765
So it was self-defence?

525
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,082
Absolutely. I think you got it now.

526
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,321
Fuck you, Mikey.

527
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,682
And I'm gonna push. And I'm gonna push.

528
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,727
Shut up.

529
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,206
To me you are just a thug.
You understand that?

530
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,809
I'm gonna be there when you fuck up.
I'm gonna put you away, you know that?

531
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,326
What part of Collinwood you from, Joe?

532
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,367
Catalpa Road.

533
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,841
- Ah. North or south of Euclid?
- South.

534
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,160
Very nice.

535
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,641
Look, I know you got
a job to do and all that.

536
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,880
You gotta remember there are
some more important things in life.

537
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,689
You care to expand on that?

538
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,083
Don't rock the boat, Joe.

539
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,006
You got a nice job. Nice car. Nice home.

540
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,162
When it comes to pushing,
I'm the wrong guy you want pushing back.

541
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,290
You threatening me?

542
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,689
'Cause if there's even a hint of that,
badge or no badge,

543
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,161
I will cut your fucking heart out
with a rusty butter knife

544
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,481
and eat it while it's still beating.

545
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,565
Understand each other?

546
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,567
Good.

547
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,086
I thought we were gonna dance there
for a second.

548
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,650
What'd you say?

549
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,089
You really wanna dance with me?

550
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,971
Danny, do you have any comment?

551
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,041
Get out of here.

552
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,561
Hey!

553
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,041
Where you going?

554
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,091
I've had it.

555
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,250
See you tomorrow, fellas.

556
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,961
Son of a bitch landlord bastard.

557
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,609
Making a poor old woman homeless.
Shame on him.

558
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,763
You tell him for me,
may he rot in the lowest pit of hell,

559
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,401
and his children and his grandchildren
and everybody he ever knew and the...

560
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,245
What's she owe?

561
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,685
Three months.

562
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,801
Beat it.

563
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,645
I don't need your pity.

564
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,405
Grace, I'm not paying your rent out of pity.

565
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,563
You're a strong Irish woman and I like that.

566
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,170
Is that so?

567
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,204
I read that article about you
in the newspaper.

568
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,165
Regular desperado, huh?

569
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,447
Stinkin' lies. All of it.

570
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,491
Why, the reporter said that you believe
you're a descendent of Celtic warriors.

571
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,649
- Was that a stinkin' lie?
- No.

572
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,205
That I said.

573
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,081
Is this the Cuyahoga?

574
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,607
No, it's the Liffey,
in Dublin, you big galoot.

575
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,969
You've never been
there, have you? I can tell.

576
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,201
Here, have a seat.

577
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,006
You know, Celtic men were so committed
to a fight to the death.

578
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,805
But they'd always leave an heirloom

579
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,850
as a legacy to protect
the ones that they loved.

580
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,084
This was my father's.

581
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,211
Now, our forebears,
our people, yours and mine,

582
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,002
they weren't just fearless.

583
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,526
They knew that there was something better
than just being a big shot.

584
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,808
Something that means having the grace
of God on your shoulder to protect you,

585
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,881
so you can protect those around you.

586
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,326
You have the eyes of a warrior, it's true.

587
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,123
But I see something else.

588
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,051
I see goodness.

589
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,607
There's no good in me.

590
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,251
Don't you ever say that.

591
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,170
We're drunks. We're fighters.
We're liars.

592
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,451
There's a bit of good in every Irishman.

593
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,964
Give me your hand.

594
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,004
Give me your hand.

595
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,562
Go on now, get out of here. Go on.

596
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,764
What'd you think about Danny Greene?

597
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,285
He's a pretty good guy.

598
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,251
Like when I was 15, I had a mini-bike,

599
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,209
and the police took it away.

600
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,009
He went and got it the same day,
brought it back.

601
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,488
Do you believe
the press this guy is getting?

602
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,848
They're calling him
the Robin Hood of Collinwood.

603
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,810
I know this guy over
at Cuyahoga National Bank.

604
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,250
Danny Greene comes in the other day
and he wants to start an educational trust.

605
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,121
He wants to take 10 orphans

606
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,249
and put them in the best private schools
in Cleveland, on his own dime.

607
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,322
Merry Christmas!

608
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,721
Good man for the neighbourhood.

609
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,768
Took care of a lot of families
that were in need.

610
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,561
Gave turkeys away for Christmas.
Gave turkeys away for Thanksgiving.

611
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,609
Merry Christmas, boys.

612
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,850
Merry Christmas.

613
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,803
Happy holiday, if you want.

614
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,049
I tell you about the time
I met Marilyn Monroe?

615
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,690
She was in town on some publicity thing.

616
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,923
One night she comes
into the Theatrical with some people,

617
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,641
including the commie writer
she married, Miller.

618
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,882
- Arthur Miller.
- Archie Miller. Yeah.

619
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,851
And everybody's there.
Licavoli. Lips Moceri.

620
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,125
And these guys are gushing for her.

621
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,764
End of the evening comes
and Miller goes home alone.

622
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,087
What's the matter?
The soup's not hot enough?

623
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,447
- Why aren't you eating?
- it's hot. We're trying to talk.

624
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,090
You must like potatoes. You must.
You're Irish.

625
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,366
We're trying to have a conversation.

626
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,841
- Ruth, for Christ's sake.
- Okay. I'm going. Okay.

627
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,483
None of these guys had it in them
to make a move.

628
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,722
It takes chutzpah,

629
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,691
brass nuts, to get what you want.

630
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,365
She was a doll.

631
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,402
Her skin was like milk.

632
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,922
What sort of place do you envision?

633
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,604
- Restaurant and lounge.
- Mmm.

634
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,365
Good food. Good cocktails.
Pretty waitresses.

635
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,249
Pure class all the way.

636
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,448
I'm calling it the Dublin Public House.

637
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,249
How much do you need?

638
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,641
I figure 70 grand will get me started.

639
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,688
I'm gonna get you the money. Not mine.

640
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,847
A businessman doesn't invest
his own money.

641
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,082
- You know who the Gambinos are?
- Sure.

642
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,011
Big dagos in New York.

643
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,169
Be serious.
Because when it comes to money,

644
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,362
take my word, they're very serious.

645
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,007
I'll send a courier to New York.

646
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,204
Thank you, Shondor.

647
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,130
You've earned it. My young friend.

648
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,690
I want the entrance to jump out, you know?
I want people to feel invited.

649
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,128
I want big gates.
You know, big wrought-iron gates.

650
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,891
Excuse me. What time do you open?

651
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,641
6:30.

652
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,644
I read this thing about the benefits
of an all vegetable diet.

653
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,527
What do you think?

654
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,643
- What do I think?
- Yeah.

655
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,005
Sure.

656
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,525
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

657
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,687
Where are you from?

658
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,287
Are you shy?

659
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,446
Youngstown.

660
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,885
Youngstown is a tough town.

661
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,881
You don't look tough.

662
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,646
Why'd you leave?

663
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,281
I... I was living with my uncle.

664
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,886
Didn't work out.

665
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,522
Well, Ellie, the fair's over in Cuyahoga
Falls this month. Do you wanna go?

666
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,849
You mean like on a date or something?

667
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,247
Yeah.

668
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,129
Mind if I ask what you do for a living?

669
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,924
I'm in the restaurant business.

670
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,924
Ellie. Damn it, I told you
to sweep the back room.

671
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,884
Mr Greene. I'm sorry, I didn't...

672
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,645
She's okay with you. Okay? No problem.

673
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,364
It's all good. Everything's good.

674
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,125
Take your time.
I'll sweep out the back room.

675
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,841
Looking back,
those were the good years.

676
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,083
Danny and I were never friends,
but I got a kick out of the guy.

677
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,925
We even ended up coaching
youth baseball together.

678
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,281
Hey, Joe. I'm going straight now.

679
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,883
You're about as straight
as a bent shillelagh.

680
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,610
And just when it looked like Danny
was going to really turn the comer...

681
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,327
So where the fuck's a guy like you
come up with 70 large?

682
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,243
It was going to some chump in Cleveland.

683
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,731
I borrowed it temporarily.

684
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,929
All right! Up against the wall!

685
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,169
There's no way to sugarcoat this, kid.

686
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,846
The courier picked up your money,
but instead of bringing it here,

687
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,604
he bought six kilos of cocaine.

688
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,727
I'll fuckin' kill him.

689
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,202
Probably not. He's in Rikers Island.

690
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,441
Where's the money?

691
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,921
Evidence locker, I suppose.
I'll make an arrangement.

692
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,368
Talk to Licavoli, offer that you do
a couple jobs free for the family.

693
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,647
That way you don't have to pay a vig.

694
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,641
"vig"?

695
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,563
There's gonna be interest on the money.

696
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,086
You borrowed money
from the Gambino family, Danny.

697
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,289
I did? How do you borrow money
if you don't receive it?

698
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,122
I understand that, but they won't.
In their eyes, lost money is lost money.

699
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,441
- I didn't lose it, the courier lost it.
- I understand.

700
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,090
It was your courier.

701
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,164
If anyone's on the hook, Shondor, it's you.

702
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,287
What?

703
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,045
I didn't hire the courier, you did.

704
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,241
What are you saying?

705
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,881
What I'm saying is,
I lost nothing to nobody.

706
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,281
Thus, I owe nothing to nobody.

707
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,007
Coming after me will be unjust.

708
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,883
And if the wops in New York
don't see it that way, then fuck 'em.

709
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,770
And if you don't see it that way, fuck you!

710
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,084
You give this to the man
who kills the Irishman.

711
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,602
Come on. Shondor?

712
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,451
I mean, sure, we had a little argument.

713
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,968
Nah. Shondor wouldn't do this.

714
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,763
Contract went out yesterday.

715
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,649
Twenty-five G's
for the head of Danny Greene.

716
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,165
Twenty-five?

717
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,447
Yeah. In cash.

718
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,169
Hey, come on. You should be flattered.

719
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,810
You want my advice?

720
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,086
Always.

721
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,771
Turn this thing around. You know,
pay Shondor the 70 large that you owe him.

722
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,763
You know, don't argue, just pay it.

723
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,330
And walk away.

724
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,848
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

725
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,686
Pride.

726
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,408
What? Celtic warrior shit?

727
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,600
It's not shit.

728
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,049
You know, you've been careful always.

729
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,481
And that's what's kept you alive.

730
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,366
You cannot go to war with Shondor Birns.

731
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,682
Remember what I told you.

732
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,084
Can't be too careful.

733
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,129
Thank you, Mr Greene.

734
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,002
...firecrackers to kill Danny Greene!

735
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,050
Danny, come on!

736
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,640
The Cadillac. It was Danny Greene's.

737
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,684
Put a 24-hour tail on him.

738
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,960
That was fun.

739
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,646
That Ferris wheel was something, huh?

740
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,404
I'm not dumb.

741
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,684
The men outside,
they're the police, aren't they?

742
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,770
Cleveland's finest.

743
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,561
You have a bad reputation. People say
you're crazy and I should watch out.

744
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,930
What people? Who's saying this?

745
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,490
I'm not telling you.
You'll probably kill them.

746
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,490
You really believe that?

747
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,370
Why'd your wife leave you?

748
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,084
I was different then.

749
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,844
- Look, maybe I should just go.
- No, no, no. Stay.

750
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,685
- There's beer in the fridge.
- I don't drink.

751
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,802
- You got soda?
- In the fridge.

752
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,003
Shondor Birns is in the pawn shop
down the street from St Malachy's.

753
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,964
He's a sitting duck.

754
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,691
The alley behind my house. Five minutes.

755
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,681
Here he comes.

756
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,287
Ah, shit.

757
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,086
Where the fuck did she come from?

758
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,329
Investigators have been here
well over a half hour.

759
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,368
What have they pieced together?
Any idea who it is?

760
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,363
As far as I can determine,
it's a white male.

761
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,564
The part that we've got, recovered.
Just the upper torso.

762
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,330
There's pieces all over the place.

763
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,006
We found a leg over against the fence.

764
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,208
Inside, Rabbi Rudolph Rosenthal
characterised Birns as no saint.

765
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,687
But he said the numbers figure
had much charity

766
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,081
and was often generous
and had many friends.

767
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,648
But also to recognise
that everybody is fallible.

768
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,129
Shakespeare said if each one of us
got his just deserts,

769
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,804
nobody would escape a whipping.

770
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,610
John Scalish at 3:45 this afternoon
had a heart attack and died.

771
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,165
John Scalish, Cleveland's don of
34 years, died during routine surgery.

772
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,727
The problem was that Scalish
hadn't named a successor.

773
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,051
And the only two candidates for the job
hated each other.

774
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,809
Jack Licavoli, who spent half his time
sucking up to the Sicilians in New York,

775
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,408
and John Nardi, who didn't.

776
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,767
Guess who won?

777
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,360
What are we gonna do
about the Irishman?

778
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,129
All right. Ask for a meeting. And keep Nardi
out of it. He's friends with the fuck.

779
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,125
The Irishman can have Shondor's business.
But we take our cut.

780
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,483
So essentially what you're saying
is we do all the work

781
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,808
and you get 30% for doing nothin', right?

782
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,328
That's the arrangement. 30%.

783
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,849
And characterise it any way you want.

784
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,411
Any way I want?

785
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,411
Any way you want.

786
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,367
Really?

787
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,761
Really.

788
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,165
Okay.

789
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,446
How about this?

790
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,564
A gang of hairy, greasy wops who came
into existence when a Greek fucked a goat

791
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,849
want to extort hard-earned money from
a band of noble Irish stock. How's that?

792
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,604
- That is ridiculous! Fuck...
- Hold it! Hold it!

793
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,881
You got a dirty mouth, young man.

794
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,003
You guys have bled me dry for too long.

795
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,803
Irishman's in business for himself now.

796
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,446
Oh, by the way,

797
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,000
I know why you guys call each other
Ronnie the Crab and Peanuts and Frankie B.

798
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,287
It's 'cause you're too fuckin' stupid
to remember each other's names.

799
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,724
See you around, Lips.

800
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,765
Okay, what do you think?

801
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,920
Thank you.

802
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,363
Danny Greene's going down.

803
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,208
- When?
- Tonight.

804
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,441
You wanna talk?

805
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,687
Yeah, I wanna talk. Not here.

806
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,161
- So you and Danny are close?
- We grew up together. What's your angle?

807
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,805
I know insults are insults.

808
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,761
But the Shondor Birns thing
has got a lot of people pissed.

809
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,410
Not at you, Billy.

810
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,490
How would you feel about
going into business with me

811
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,085
and owning all of Collinwood?

812
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,891
What the hell is this thing?

813
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,441
You've talked to Licavoli?

814
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,286
Of course.

815
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,324
Ain't it about time you stepped up?
Think how easy it'd be.

816
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,926
Very easy.

817
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,685
Come on, Danny, come on.

818
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,487
Come on, Danny!

819
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,806
Danny?

820
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,364
There's been times
when other people have attempted

821
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,129
shots at his life, the Frato situation...

822
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,689
But I have no idea.
And I'm sure Mr Greene doesn't at this time.

823
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,886
He's a little shook up.

824
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,562
Police have issued arrest warrants
for the two men they say are responsible

825
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,645
for blowing up Dan Greene's home.
So far those men have not been caught.

826
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,520
And police are expected to go to the
grand jury this week to seek indictments.

827
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,690
Ryan Ross, Action 3 News.

828
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,088
You missed?
What the fuck does that mean, huh?

829
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,924
People are intimidated!

830
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,603
Intimidated? Are you intimidated? Huh?

831
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,764
You? You intimidated?

832
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,446
Come on. Get outta of here. Get outta here!

833
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,565
The night before my house went up,

834
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,087
I heard a rumour that Tommy Sinito
came to you with an offer to play Judas.

835
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,281
Two days later, Cleveland P.D. finds him
at the bottom of a lake,

836
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,051
tied to a cast iron sink
you were hauling around.

837
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,603
I wouldn't know anything about that.

838
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,168
You're the only thing that I've
got in this world, Danny. You know that.

839
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,727
This is about the fourth time
someone's tried to kill you.

840
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,610
How do you account for the fact
that you survive each time?

841
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,491
I'm an Irish Catholic
with the grace of God on my shoulder.

842
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,523
I'm not going anywhere until he says so.

843
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,451
You see this trailer behind me?
It's where I work.

844
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,651
See the bar at the end of the street there?

845
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,451
Get a shot of that. I live on the top floor.

846
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,730
Let me tell you something.

847
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,566
If any of these maggots from
the so-called Mafia wanna come after me,

848
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,211
I'm not a hard man to find.

849
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,168
You know, you must have
the biggest nuts in Cleveland.

850
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,131
Yeah. I saw you on the news.

851
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,728
The problem is,
is you got too much heat on you.

852
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,689
Licavoli breaking your balls, John?

853
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,362
Well, he's not blowing up my house.

854
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,880
The fucking cretin won, you know?
He's the boss. I get that.

855
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,447
The cocksucker's trying
to take over my business.

856
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,843
I gotta put my foot down.

857
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,771
I was thinking,

858
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,122
maybe you need somebody
to watch your back.

859
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,567
What are you saying?

860
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,724
Well, what I'm saying is,
alone, I could never take over Licavoli.

861
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,082
But together, there's no stopping us.

862
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,011
- You wanna be partners?
- Yeah.

863
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,081
You're serious?

864
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:25,088
You know,
I'm gonna show you how serious that I am.

865
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,123
This is the kid from the Highlander,
the valet who put the bomb in your car.

866
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,567
Look at him.

867
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,409
Your enemies are my enemies.

868
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,731
Fuck you! I never should have trusted you!

869
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,208
You ain't got the balls to do it yourself,
do you?

870
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,526
There is some
kind of gang war in Cleveland.

871
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,125
The figures over recent months

872
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,207
show that for those involved, life
expectancy is very short and getting shorter.

873
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,727
That summer in 1976,
36 bombs exploded in Cleveland.

874
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,361
The Danny Greene War
became the subject of national attention.

875
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,848
Federal authorities
expect more murders,

876
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,561
as the hierarchy of organised crime
in Cleveland continues to violently realign.

877
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,483
Jeff Campbell, Eyewitness News, Cleveland.

878
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,411
A steel door?

879
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,005
It's just a precaution.

880
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,881
I want you safe.

881
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,089
I don't want safe. I want you.

882
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,646
It's a Claddagh ring.

883
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,325
Women in Ireland have worn them
for 300 years.

884
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,803
The hands symbolise friendship.

885
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,730
The heart, love.

886
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,969
And the crown, loyalty.

887
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,128
If you wear it with the heart facing out,

888
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,451
it means you're free.

889
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,130
If you wear it with the heart facing in,

890
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,325
it means you're taken.

891
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,330
Don't put it on until you know.

892
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,289
Ellie, I have a plan.

893
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,684
A plan to set things right.

894
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,690
But it will mean leaving here for good.

895
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,930
- But Cleveland...
- it's all I've ever known,

896
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,004
but it's no good for me any more.

897
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,924
I wanna go someplace I can breathe again,
you know?

898
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,000
I'm getting calls from New York
every half hour.

899
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,240
This guy, he went on television
daring us to do something about it,

900
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,287
for crying out loud!

901
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,531
What am I gonna tell them, huh?

902
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,208
What is going on here?

903
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,523
Your people! Your people...
You can't do a simple job?

904
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,684
My people? My people are your people!

905
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,008
Your family is becoming
a major fucking embarrassment.

906
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,686
I am still getting calls
from Paulie Castellano

907
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,965
about that 70 Gs
that he lent to that prick Shondor Birns.

908
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,964
What the hell is going on out there?

909
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,248
This is one guy,
and you can't take care of it?

910
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,241
We've shot him. We've blown him up.

911
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,082
I mean, nothing we do
seems to matter with this guy.

912
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,329
Eight times you tried
to get this mick cocksucker, huh?

913
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,722
What are you doing? Where's your men?

914
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,291
Where's Brancato?

915
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,369
- He's watching the city.
- Watching the city?

916
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,648
You might as well
give the city to this mick prick.

917
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,925
All right. I understand
that you got a difficult situation here.

918
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,802
Generally speaking, you got things
under control. I understand that.

919
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,766
I'm gonna propose something to you, okay?

920
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,171
I would consider it a personal favour
if you would ask my help in this.

921
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,647
Okay? I can do this for you.

922
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,730
I can be there for you on this one here.

923
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,321
But you have to give me the word.

924
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,605
Do me this favour.

925
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,370
Then it's done.

926
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,411
"Vast lands
fit for an industry on the rise."

927
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,486
I don't know
where you come up with these crazy ideas.

928
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,368
I mean, do you know anything about Texas?
No.

929
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,688
You know anything about cattle ranching?
No, you do not.

930
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,531
He's crazy. You know that?

931
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,961
What's it gonna take to get this place
in order, John? All of it.

932
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,487
The land, new cattle. The whole thing.

933
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,846
A couple of million.

934
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,367
I mean...

935
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,689
- That much, huh?
- I'm guessing.

936
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,961
Why not?

937
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,521
- We can move there?
- Damn straight.

938
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,210
You have that much money?

939
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,967
You know, someone once told me,

940
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,010
"A businessman
never invests his own money."

941
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,847
You got a pair of balls, let me tell you.

942
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,004
$2 million! $2 million!

943
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,607
You didn't pay back
the $70,000 that you borrowed.

944
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,569
Why should I lend you $2 million?

945
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,683
- To get rid of me.
- To get rid of you?

946
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,644
I could get rid of you with one
spick outside for $100.

947
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,721
What the fuck you talking about?

948
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,484
Hey, let me take this guy out back
right now and take...

949
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,005
Shut the fuck up!

950
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,251
I apologise.

951
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,603
I'll leave Cleveland,
hand everything over to Licavoli.

952
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,841
Your money will help fix up Texas feed lots,
land, cattle.

953
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,171
And the best part.

954
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:20,564
We sell the meat through co-op outlets
that I can tie directly to the unions.

955
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,967
That guarantees sales nationwide.

956
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,131
Projected income is $3 million
in the first year alone.

957
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,961
Gonna have a cattle drive
like John Wayne, huh?

958
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,562
Yippie-aye-oh!
We're gonna become cowboys.

959
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,002
So this is the Irishman, huh?

960
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,046
That's right.

961
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,970
It's not as crazy as it sounds.

962
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,162
You know, you'll be getting 50% of the cut.

963
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,723
And more importantly,
this business is legitimate.

964
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,768
You know, totally. I mean, almost.

965
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,964
I'll think about it.

966
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,201
Yeah, it's good to see you again, Frank.

967
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,004
How do you think it went in there?

968
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,082
Yeah, it was good to see you, too.

969
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,605
Who knows when I'll see you again.

970
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,166
- I got a joke you can pass on to Salerno.
- What is it?

971
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,810
Why do you call Italian guys "wops"?

972
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,323
Throw a piece of shit against the wall,
it goes, "Wop!"

973
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,085
Yeah, yeah. Wop this.

974
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,650
Get the fuck outta here.

975
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,804
All of yous, you bunch of Irish pricks.
All of yous.

976
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,210
Move the fuck outta here.

977
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,250
I want you to go to Los Angeles,
see Ray Ferrito.

978
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,644
- I thought he went back to Italy.
- No.

979
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,929
You take Julius with you.
This way we get two for the price of one.

980
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,246
Okay. Whatever's gotta be.

981
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,601
Irish pricks.

982
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,804
This is the guy?
He don't look so tough.

983
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,968
I understand you're having
some problems in Cleveland.

984
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,041
I got two problems.

985
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,805
This guy Nardi and this guy, the Irishman.

986
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,766
- What's in it for me?
- Don't worry about your share.

987
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,931
New York wants this guy out,
you take him out.

988
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,050
You'll get yours, all right, guy?

989
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,326
Once John Nardi's gone,

990
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,562
you'll get his territory
and everything that comes with it.

991
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,084
- Licavoli's agreed?
- Yeah.

992
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,251
So how you gonna do it?

993
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,890
I mean, it's not like you can just walk up
to the guy in your fancy business suit

994
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,610
and say, "Hi, I'm here to whack you."

995
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,967
Sure you can.

996
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,801
Hi, I'm here to whack you.

997
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,721
See you in Cleveland.

998
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,160
Yeah, have a nice trip.

999
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,128
Who gives a shit
about Texas, anyway?

1000
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,800
The place smells like shit.

1001
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,003
We're gonna take this city over, Danny.

1002
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,525
- Right, pal?
- Sure.

1003
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,561
You and me.

1004
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,405
John, I want you to be careful.

1005
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,369
You know, you Irish, you worry too much.

1006
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,643
Look, I never liked that Licavoli.

1007
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,046
And I don't trust that cocksucker
in New York, either.

1008
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,171
You know what?
And they're scared of you and me.

1009
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,810
And they got good reason to be.

1010
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,087
Hey, Danny. We're moving up!

1011
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,281
John?

1012
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,606
Give me a hand up, all right?

1013
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,363
Come on. I'll walk home.
I don't live far from here.

1014
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,041
I'm gonna go home.
I'm gonna lie down, have a rest.

1015
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:26,409
John, let's just rest here. Hey, buddy?

1016
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,968
Hey, Danny. We're moving up, Danny boy.

1017
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,845
We sure are.

1018
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,963
Everything's gonna be all right.

1019
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,690
Danny, come on.

1020
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,726
John Nardi,

1021
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,049
for three decades, a prominent member
of Cleveland's crime syndicates,

1022
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,329
was killed today by a bomb
rigged to the ignition of his car.

1023
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:07,921
Nardi 's murder

1024
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,244
brings the number of organised crime figures
slain in Cleveland this year to four.

1025
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,728
Reporting live from
Cleveland, Jeff Campbell.

1026
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,251
You got a problem?

1027
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,046
No. Do you?

1028
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,204
I don't have a problem.

1029
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,285
I think you do.

1030
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,570
I think most people in Cleveland
would say you've got a problem.

1031
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,329
Who are you?

1032
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,245
Answer me!

1033
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,927
Who are you?

1034
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,968
What did you call me for?
I shouldn't be doing this.

1035
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,726
Licavoli wants a sit-down with you.
Just you and him.

1036
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,722
He's gonna offer you a treaty
and he wants you to sell it to Danny.

1037
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,131
You're the only one he'll listen to.

1038
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,401
What, do I look like a fucking idiot?

1039
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,448
We're gonna drive over to a pay phone
down at the docks.

1040
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,204
Licavoli is gonna call at 3:00 p.m.

1041
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,442
You tell him where you want him to go,
and he'll be there.

1042
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,444
And if anything feels fishy,
shoot me in the fucking head, okay?

1043
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,847
Come on.

1044
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,488
- Get in the fucking car.
- You fucking don't believe nobody.

1045
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,846
You're fucking impossible, man.

1046
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,651
Danny? What the fuck?

1047
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,121
Brings back memories, huh?

1048
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,486
Right on time. Name the place.

1049
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,201
- Tell him to meet me behind the Highlander.
- You got it.

1050
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,928
- What's with the ice?
- Bad tooth.

1051
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,207
You wanna talk?

1052
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,809
I heard about your friend Billy
and your man Keith.

1053
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,442
Me and mine will take our chances.

1054
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,769
It's bad, Danny. it's over.

1055
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,969
His name is Ray Ferrito.

1056
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,366
We checked him out.

1057
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,563
He doesn't make mistakes.

1058
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:09,811
He gets close. Your family.
Your mother. Your girlfriend.

1059
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,771
They have not built a bomb big enough
to kill Danny Greene.

1060
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,485
You really think the luck of the Irish
is gonna save you?

1061
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,090
My enemies will be taken care of, Joe.
I promise.

1062
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,125
Good luck, Danny.

1063
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:40,847
Hey, Joe.

1064
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,280
Thank you.

1065
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,402
"I was too embarrassed to recite this
in person, so I'm sending this in a letter.

1066
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,524
"The Ballad of Danny Greene.

1067
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,284
"They've shot and they've bombed.

1068
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,331
"Tried all that they knew
to bring Danny Greene's time to an end.

1069
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:34,882
"But warriors don't fall.
This legend still stands.

1070
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,681
"My captain. My brother. My friend.

1071
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,925
"Bill McComber. "

1072
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:00,927
Hello?

1073
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:01,922
Hey, baby.

1074
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,651
I made you that dentist appointment.
Take this down.

1075
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:12,689
Brainard Medical Building,
2000 Brainard Place, Lyndhurst, 3.'00 p.m.

1076
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,686
Thanks, honey.

1077
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,766
There's something else.

1078
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,647
Something I...

1079
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,323
I want you to know.

1080
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,327
I love you.

1081
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,647
Danny?

1082
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,927
Danny?

1083
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,926
I changed the oil. She's clean.

1084
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,243
- You sure you don't want me to go with you?
- Nah.

1085
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,522
Get your fuckin' hands off my car.

1086
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,441
Let's take
a look at that tooth, Mr Greene.

1087
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,730
Hey, mister, are you him? The Irishman?

1088
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,042
What about it?

1089
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,090
My cousin Timmy says you got
more balls than anybody.

1090
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,608
He wants to be just like you.

1091
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:06,128
You don't wanna be just like me, kid.
Go on, get outta here.

1092
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,567
Come here, you.

1093
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,285
Go on, beat it.

1094
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:47,889
Ray Ferrito, the hit man who killed
Danny Greene, got too big for his britches.

1095
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,691
So the Cleveland Mafia
took a contract out on him.

1096
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,401
What did Ray Ferrito do?
Went to the feds and cut a deal.

1097
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:58,201
The resulting trial led
to the indictments of Jack Licavoli

1098
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,329
and L.A. gangster
Jimmy "The Weasel" Fratianno,

1099
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,927
who testified against Mafia associates
across the nation.

1100
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:08,004
It would all lead to
the famous Commission trial,

1101
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:12,005
which convicted bosses
in each of New York's five families.

1102
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:17,402
Danny Greene's murder directly led to
the indictment of 27 Mafia associates,

1103
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,001
and the collapse of organised crime
in Cleveland.

1104
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,640
The Cleveland Mafia has never recovered.

1105
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,287
This is about the fourth time
someone's tried to kill you.

1106
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:29,523
How do you account for the fact
that you survive each time?

1107
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,921
You want me to give you the Irish version?

1108
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,967
What's the Irish version?

1109
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,646
The guy upstairs pulls the strings,
you're gone. There's no other way.

1110
