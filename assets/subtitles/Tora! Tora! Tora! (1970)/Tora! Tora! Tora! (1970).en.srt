1
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,612
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief
isn't the coward they say he is.

2
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,658
Whatever they say, Yamamoto is
the kind of leader we need.

3
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,285
He believes in the value
of the airplane.

4
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,623
But why a vice-Navy Minister
for such an important position?

5
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,502
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was
detrimental to Yamamoto's health.

6
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,173
The Army is against him for
opposing their policies.

7
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,973
So he runs away to sea. Now he
has the entire fleet to guard him.

8
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,684
This order makes you
Commander-in-Chief.

9
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:55,020
The Imperial fleet consists of-

10
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:58,983
Save your breath, Yoshida.
Those details are in the documents.

11
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,152
You haven't changed!

12
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,531
With the Army controlling politics...

13
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,993
...your job as Navy Minister
will be difficult.

14
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,954
Thank God you're here.

15
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:13,914
We know your life
has been threatened.

16
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,543
I'm not that easy to kill.

17
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:25,593
Army hotheads are demanding
an alliance with Germany.

18
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:28,804
That would be tragic for Japan.

19
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:31,766
As Navy Minister I will...

20
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:34,727
...continue to fight with the Army.

21
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,690
You are our last hope, Yoshida.

22
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,860
The Navy must stand firm
against the alliance.

23
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:58,876
America is against the war
we are waging in China...

24
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:02,671
...and angry that we are
negotiating with the Germans.

25
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:08,761
Now we are threatened with an embargo
of the raw materials we need.

26
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:14,225
Either we improve relations with the U.S.
and withdraw from China...

27
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,856
...or find another source of
raw materials here in Indo-China.

28
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:26,028
Why worry about threats
from America?

29
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,032
President Roosevelt's attention
is on Europe...

30
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:35,371
...where Germany is winning a
quick victory over the Allied Armies.

31
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,044
Now is the time to strike.

32
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:49,093
The British, the Dutch and the French
are withdrawing their forces...

33
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:57,142
...from Southeast Asia to
strengthen their armies in Europe.

34
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:01,272
We must be careful.

35
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,901
The Americans have an Army
in the Philippines...

36
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:14,785
...and they have moved their Pacific
Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.

37
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:24,670
Yes, and that fleet is a knife
leveled at Japan's throat.

38
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:09,965
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.

39
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:11,675
Thank you.

40
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,931
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.

41
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,933
You know that.

42
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,354
When Nomura took over as ambassador...

43
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:26,690
...I had some hopes of settling
our differences.

44
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,860
But our meetings so far
have been unproductive.

45
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:34,531
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.

46
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:38,327
He brings me counterproposals,
and so on.

47
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:44,375
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.

48
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,961
That's what he's doing,
at our expense.

49
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,255
The president believes him
to be a man of honor...

50
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:53,175
...that we can trust and deal with.

51
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:59,223
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.

52
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,892
It is always a pleasure.

53
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:05,854
I assume you know Mr. Stimson,
the head of our War Department.

54
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:08,232
Oh, yes, of course.

55
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:10,401
Mr. Ambassador.

56
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,778
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...

57
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,490
...your presence here
does not indicate anything ominous.

58
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,117
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.

59
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:21,286
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?

60
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:23,038
Thank you.

61
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:31,255
Well, since our last talk
a week ago...

62
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:33,757
...I have received certain...

63
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,260
...shall we say...

64
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:39,138
...questions from my government...

65
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,642
...to put to you
to clarify certain matters.

66
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:05,831
Good morning, colonel.

67
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:11,837
There it is.

68
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:19,636
This machine lets us intercept
every word between Tokyo...

69
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:21,513
...and all Japanese embassies.

70
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:26,060
The coded material is fed
into that machine.

71
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:30,981
It goes round and round in there...

72
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:35,611
...and comes out here,
decoded in Japanese.

73
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:38,489
All we have to do is translate it.

74
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,536
We decode this quicker than
the Japanese embassy...

75
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:46,497
...right here in Washington.

76
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,377
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic. "

77
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:57,299
-The latest intercept, sir.
-Thank you.

78
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:05,349
Things are getting a little
hotter in the Pacific.

79
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:17,486
As long as we're sharing
this assignment...

80
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,197
...take a look at this.

81
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,537
Behold the 12 apostles.

82
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:31,583
The chosen few are authorized
to see the magic intercepts.

83
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:35,921
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps,
isn't on the list.

84
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:41,009
No, and not one of our
overseas commanders.

85
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:24,469
Excellent!

86
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:34,146
Who is in command of
those torpedo planes?

87
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:37,816
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir,
from the carrier Akagi.

88
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,819
Send him this message from me.

89
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,614
"Congratulations on brilliant
torpedo attack. "

90
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:08,305
If we are forced into
a war with America...

91
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,766
...Japan's only hope...

92
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:14,853
...is to annihilate the American Pacific
fleet at the outset.

93
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:20,943
I wonder if we could use
torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?

94
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:33,872
Stand by.

95
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,126
Execute.

96
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,981
Look at that entrance to the harbor.

97
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,902
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel
and you've bottled up our whole fleet.

98
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,825
You know as well as I do,
this harbor is a mousetrap.

99
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:14,997
Fleet should have stayed
in San Diego where it belongs.

100
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:18,667
I made the mistake to point
that out to Roosevelt.

101
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,544
We're expected to obey orders.

102
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:26,925
We're also expected to exercise
our own good judgment.

103
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:28,427
I didn't ask for the job.

104
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:34,099
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command,
and it's become habit...

105
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,810
...to worry about the security
of the fleet.

106
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:41,064
The British, flying some
old biplanes...

107
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:45,527
...torpedoed and sank three Italian
battleships at Taranto.

108
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,572
-Harbor very much like this one.
-Well...

109
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:53,618
...I share your concern, but CNO
doesn't think it can happen here.

110
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:54,911
Why not?

111
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,372
A torpedo dropped
from a plane plunges...

112
00:16:57,623 --> 00:17:01,293
...to a depth of 75 feet or more
before it levels off.

113
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,588
I know, and Pearl is only
40 feet deep.

114
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:08,050
I'm still worried, Kim.

115
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:21,730
Frankly, sir, I was stunned
when I heard of your proposal.

116
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,399
You think the plan is reckless?

117
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:28,445
You suggest using torpedo planes
against the American Fleet...

118
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:31,239
...but Pearl Harbor is
too shallow for that.

119
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:33,575
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...

120
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,663
...but the British torpedoed and sank
three Italian battleships there.

121
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:43,919
I know as well as you do
that my plan is a gamble.

122
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:47,756
And it's risky,
but we have no choice.

123
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:52,803
What I need immediately is
a plan for such an attack.

124
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:58,266
Then we should consult with Genda...

125
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:04,439
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi,
a superb strategist.

126
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:07,776
Yes, I remember Genda.
We'll talk to him.

127
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:44,521
Glad to see you, Genda.

128
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:47,190
So this is the new Zero?

129
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:50,193
Type 21, with folding wings.

130
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:56,158
This means we can carry
more fighters now.

131
00:18:56,576 --> 00:19:00,537
This Zero is fast, maneuverable
and has a long cruising range.

132
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:03,165
Better than the Messerschmitt
or Spitfire?

133
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:06,501
Definitely. I've seen both
in combat over London.

134
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,504
You outrank me, so it must be true.

135
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:16,720
Now that you're Staff Officer here,
things will be tough.

136
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:21,266
You don't have to worry,
you won't be here.

137
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:24,895
You're going to the Third Fleet
with a promotion.

138
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,773
The Commander-in-Chief
must think you're good!

139
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:32,944
Of course he does!
And I've got proof!

140
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,406
Here is his telegram.
Want to read it?

141
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:05,310
Ten-hut!

142
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:18,657
Do the planes have to be
parked like that?

143
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,951
Way at the edge of the field.

144
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,161
Standard dispersal procedure, general.

145
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:24,746
In case of enemy air attack.

146
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,543
There are 130,000 Japanese
on this island.

147
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:31,836
Our main problem is sabotage.

148
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:36,258
It'd be too easy for enemies
to sneak in at night...

149
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:40,178
...and blow up every one of them
if they're left out there.

150
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,639
Make a note, Fielder.
We'll have to make changes.

151
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:43,932
Yes, sir.

152
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:45,767
Ten-hut.

153
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,858
-Yes?
Admiral Halsey's here to see you.

154
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:55,694
Send him in, please.

155
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:03,577
Blast me, break me, court-martial me,
draw and quarter me...

156
00:21:03,786 --> 00:21:06,037
...if you think they're gonna
send my ships...

157
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:08,456
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.

158
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,835
Kim, I think they've
gone nuts in Washington.

159
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:14,588
How will I fight
a task force if they send...

160
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:16,590
...my ships to the Atlantic?

161
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,468
That damn ocean is a swimming hole
compared to the Pacific.

162
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:24,139
What are we, a fighting fleet,
or are these toy boats out here...

163
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:26,600
...so the Japs
can buy them at Christmas?

164
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,354
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.

165
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:34,733
They asked for some
of our tankers too.

166
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,402
How do they expect to feed
these wagons...

167
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:40,614
...parked out here on
this land-locked duck pond?

168
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:43,742
You're still planning on rotating
half of them at sea?

169
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:45,035
I was.

170
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:49,664
Look, Kim, you've got to make them
understand what's going on out here.

171
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,712
I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill.

172
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,173
Even go to the president.

173
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,262
By God, I knew there was
at least one man...

174
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,390
...in this man's Navy
who hadn't gone nuts.

175
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,223
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.

176
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:54,270
A strange man, he works in his
cabin like a hermit.

177
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,981
But he should be here.

178
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:02,612
Watanabe, go and ask him
to join us.

179
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:08,159
When "Gandhi" concentrates on
a plan, he is lost to this world.

180
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:19,504
Please don't bother me!
This is important...

181
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:21,423
...so I'm not going.

182
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:27,846
Genda's plan for attacking
Pearl Harbor...

183
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:32,434
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!

184
00:23:33,978 --> 00:23:37,313
He stresses the importance
of combat aircraft.

185
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,652
Just think of it.

186
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:49,534
We use six aircraft carriers...

187
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:52,954
...torpedo planes...

188
00:23:54,874 --> 00:23:56,791
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.

189
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:59,335
Zero fighters for cover...

190
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:05,341
...go by the northern route,
use the new torpedoes...

191
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:14,142
...we attack on a weekend.

192
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:18,688
Genda has thought of everything...

193
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,150
...refueling...

194
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,323
...the weather...

195
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:33,912
And we go on to say,
"It should be noted that Japan...

196
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:38,500
...has never preceded hostile action
by a declaration of war.

197
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:41,503
We have concluded it possible
that a fast-rated...

198
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:45,757
...Japanese carrier force may arrive
in Hawaii with no prior warning...

199
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:47,926
...from our intelligence service.

200
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:51,429
The most favorable time
to the enemy would be dawn.

201
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:54,849
He probably would employ
a maximum of six carriers...

202
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,810
...strike on a weekend.

203
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:59,562
-We recommend that the Air Corps-"
-I read it.

204
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:01,815
Yes, sir.

205
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:07,570
I appreciate the work that you
and General Martin have put in.

206
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:12,283
These reports are very useful
to General Short and myself.

207
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:17,121
General Martin, you don't pull
any punches, do you?

208
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:24,462
"We recommend that the Air Corps...

209
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,215
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...

210
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:30,093
...of the Hawaiian area
during daylight.

211
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:35,306
This will require a force of
180 B-17 airplanes. "

212
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:37,934
We can't search the sea approaches...

213
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:39,644
...unless we have the planes, sir.

214
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:43,898
One hundred and eighty B-17s?

215
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,404
For God's sakes, that's more than
the number existing in the States.

216
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:53,825
It looks fine on paper, but that's
not a paper fleet out there.

217
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:57,161
Squadron from the Enterprise.

218
00:25:57,413 --> 00:26:00,832
Bill Halsey's working
the tails off his men.

219
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:05,128
Wish we had more like him.

220
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:08,673
Makes the most of what he's got.

221
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,593
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.

222
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,530
Well, not one bomb anywhere
near the target for the past hour.

223
00:26:33,782 --> 00:26:37,327
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.

224
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:41,205
-Who's next?
-It's Anderson, sir.

225
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:50,214
Now, that's more like it.

226
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:54,510
-Maybe your boys finally get it.
-I hope so, sir.

227
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,138
Who's next?

228
00:26:57,973 --> 00:26:59,724
Lieutenant Dickenson.

229
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:08,066
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...

230
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:11,319
...he couldn't hit a bull
in the butt with a bass fiddle.

231
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:12,570
Yes, sir.

232
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,369
Ten-hut.

233
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:31,547
-Carry on.
-Carry on.

234
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:33,716
This it?

235
00:27:33,884 --> 00:27:35,510
Yes, sir. Our new radar.

236
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:38,179
It's a remarkable
scientific achievement...

237
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:41,599
...capable of spotting an intruder
on the sea or in the air...

238
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,017
...and at quite a range.

239
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:47,438
Now, listen, colonel,
as you know, we're short on patrol planes.

240
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:50,274
We're gonna have to rely on this...

241
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:53,236
...thing to detect the enemy.

242
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:56,197
General, radar should do the job.

243
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,116
What's it doing here, not set up?

244
00:27:58,283 --> 00:28:00,618
We're about to truck it up
that mountain.

245
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:05,707
That peak up there is the ideal spot
to put our main radar post.

246
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,710
At that height, we'd be clear
of all interference.

247
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:10,628
Obviously.

248
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:14,590
But, sir, we can't get permission
to put her up there.

249
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,342
Permission?

250
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,053
From the National Park Service
Department of Interior.

251
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:23,766
See, all of this belongs
to the Hawaiian National Park.

252
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:25,935
The Hawaiian National Park?

253
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:31,024
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.

254
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:34,318
And we can't get permission?

255
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,988
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.

256
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:40,074
Fight them? You're damn right
we're gonna fight them.

257
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,618
-Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
-Yes, sir.

258
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:46,330
Wildlife Preservation Society.

259
00:28:57,551 --> 00:28:59,343
I feel like a damn fool.

260
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,430
Without even consulting me...

261
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:06,642
...our Army has decided
to occupy Indo-China.

262
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,980
There is no hope for peace now.

263
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:15,193
I've said it before
and I'll keep on saying it...

264
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:19,614
...if we fight the Americans, we can't
stop at Hawaii or San Francisco.

265
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:22,325
We'll have to march
into Washington...

266
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:25,787
...and dictate peace terms
in the White House!

267
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:32,293
Army hotheads who speak so lightly
of war should think about that!

268
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:39,467
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,
I can do nothing.

269
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:46,224
I'm sorry.

270
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:51,521
Don't blame yourself.
The Army leaders are at fault, not you.

271
00:29:55,734 --> 00:30:00,571
I must get back to the fleet.
There is a lot to be done.

272
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:08,913
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.

273
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,124
He took it up with General Marshall.

274
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:15,253
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra list.

275
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,172
Incredible.

276
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:20,550
Withholding information
from the president.

277
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,638
Security found a copy of an intercept
in a wastebasket at the White House.

278
00:30:26,181 --> 00:30:30,393
Truth is, the brass don't trust some
men close to the president.

279
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:33,104
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?

280
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:36,524
-Do you even trust your own wife?
-Do you?

281
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,279
Come to think of it, I believe I do.

282
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:44,782
Part two of No. 1390, colonel.

283
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:47,201
Tokyo to embassies
in Washington and Berlin.

284
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,078
Thank you, Miss Cave.

285
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:57,253
The Japanese are moving south
to occupy French Indo-China.

286
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:02,967
-This is big trouble.
-Yeah.

287
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,803
Well, ultra list or not...

288
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:08,973
...someone has to tell
the president about this one.

289
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,480
"Therefore, we will impose
a full embargo...

290
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:18,983
...on all trade with Japan.

291
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:24,405
We do not anticipate immediate
hostile action by Japan...

292
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:26,157
...but you get this information...

293
00:31:26,325 --> 00:31:30,912
...so you may take appropriate
precautionary measures. "

294
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:36,334
"Appropriate precautionary measures. "

295
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:38,794
What the hell does that mean?

296
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:48,596
Now, this is signed jointly
by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.

297
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:53,601
Until we know how the Japanese will
react, we're not gonna take chances.

298
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:57,855
-We go on full alert.
-Yes, sir.

299
00:31:58,857 --> 00:32:02,526
Stark says they don't anticipate
hostile action.

300
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:06,030
Why send a warning at all?

301
00:32:07,616 --> 00:32:08,991
Damn it.

302
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:14,789
Damn it, why can't Washington
give us the full inside story?

303
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,625
I'd sooner form my own opinion.

304
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:25,383
"Don't anticipate hostile action. "

305
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,222
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.

306
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:34,892
Increase air and sub patrols,
alert senior commanders.

307
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,813
Maybe out of this we can find out
how well we can function.

308
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:42,858
Kaminsky.

309
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:46,237
This is Captain Earle.
Going on full alert.

310
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:47,905
Yes, captain.

311
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:49,699
We're going on full alert.

312
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:52,910
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.

313
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:48,132
What the hell is going on here?

314
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:49,633
What are you doing?

315
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:53,137
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.

316
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:55,973
All aircraft not ready
for flight from now on...

317
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:58,351
...will be parked in the center...

318
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,227
...so they can be kept under guard.

319
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,937
Suppose there's an air raid.

320
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:04,982
They hit one plane, and it all
goes up in flames.

321
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,151
I'm sorry. General's orders.

322
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,697
Today's war games...

323
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:58,285
...of a theoretical attack
on Pearl Harbor...

324
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,291
...clearly show the need for
six carriers in the attack force.

325
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:06,961
The General Staff...

326
00:35:09,214 --> 00:35:12,550
...wants to limit us to only
three carriers.

327
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,719
We must have six!

328
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:21,183
If we reduce our striking force...

329
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:23,894
...from six carriers to only three...

330
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:26,647
...our mission will fail.

331
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:31,235
Before attacking anything else,
we should attack our General Staff.

332
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:36,532
We believe in aircraft,
but they cling to the ancient theory...

333
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:42,246
...that decisive naval engagements
must be fought between battleships.

334
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:44,498
Unless we dispel this myth...

335
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,917
...we'll never get their approval.

336
00:35:48,336 --> 00:35:52,214
They are not the only believers
in the "battleship theory. "

337
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:57,219
Many officers here today
also support the idea.

338
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:03,350
I'm one of them. We'll soon have
two new unsinkable battlewagons...

339
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:08,272
...each with a displacement of
64,000 tons and huge guns.

340
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:12,902
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.

341
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:16,363
The war in Europe is being
decided by the airplane.

342
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:21,035
There can be no victory on land or sea,
without control of the air!

343
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,622
I have been chosen to command
this task force.

344
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:27,917
And I consider this operation risky.

345
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:32,421
How can we travel 3500 miles
to Hawaii without being detected?

346
00:36:32,964 --> 00:36:36,592
This mission will fail unless
we achieve complete surprise.

347
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:39,637
My ships can't carry fuel
for a trip there and back.

348
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:43,891
Stopping to refuel increases
the possibility of detection.

349
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:51,565
I am confident that our ships
will reach Hawaii safely.

350
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:56,904
You are too cautious. The case
for using six carriers is sound.

351
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,449
To criticize the plan is defeatist!

352
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:23,973
No more bickering! As Long
as I am Commander-in-Chief...

353
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,977
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!

354
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:34,775
I am aware that this is
a dangerous gamble.

355
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:38,529
But we can't afford the luxury
of playing it safe now!

356
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:49,540
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this
plan or not is no longer an issue.

357
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,794
Let us now decide how best
to carry it out.

358
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,104
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!

359
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,904
Fuchida! What a surprise!

360
00:38:21,406 --> 00:38:24,575
I'm your new Air Commander,
so treat me well.

361
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:29,163
You're joking. How did you
rate another promotion?

362
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:33,083
Well, exceptional people get
exceptional treatment!

363
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,930
This ship is crawling with Admirals.

364
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,434
Something important
must be happening.

365
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:54,229
We have called you here...

366
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:58,108
...to explain the purpose of
a new training program.

367
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,780
This, of course, is a matter
of strictest secrecy.

368
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:51,286
It looks just like Pearl Harbor,
doesn't it?

369
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:55,082
And that area down there
Looks like Ford Island, eh?

370
00:40:32,328 --> 00:40:33,787
Beautiful!

371
00:40:57,562 --> 00:41:00,856
Navy pilots attract geisha girls
but they frighten the fish.

372
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:18,332
It's not an ideal radar site,
but at least we got a permit.

373
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,417
Let's get the other units working.

374
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:21,919
Easier said than done.

375
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:23,170
What do you mean?

376
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:27,800
We have to get all six units adjusted
and link them by phone to headquarters.

377
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:31,053
That means training men to operate
an information center...

378
00:41:31,262 --> 00:41:33,597
...so they know what to do
with the information.

379
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:35,182
Take it easy, Murph.

380
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:40,354
-You'll figure it out.
-Yeah, I'll figure it out.

381
00:41:43,608 --> 00:41:44,942
Don't just stand there.

382
00:41:45,193 --> 00:41:47,069
You know how to operate this thing.

383
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,278
We know the theory.

384
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:50,447
Let's put that theory into practice.

385
00:41:50,698 --> 00:41:53,367
-Switch on.
-Yes, sir.

386
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,455
Stay put and keep watching the screen.

387
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:02,417
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.

388
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:05,462
Excuse me, sir,
but what are we watching for?

389
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:06,839
Anything unusual.

390
00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:09,258
Any large blip coming from the sea.

391
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:12,261
Colonel, if we do spot something,
what do we do?

392
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,055
Report it to headquarters, damn it.

393
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:16,598
How, sir?
-What?

394
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,642
We haven't got a telephone, sir.

395
00:42:18,935 --> 00:42:22,104
There's a gas station
a mile down the road.

396
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:23,772
They must have a phone.

397
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:38,954
We got 183 combat planes
on this base, general.

398
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:43,166
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed
monkey hanging from a balloon...

399
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:46,086
...could scatter them to hell
with one hand grenade.

400
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:48,005
General Short gave the order.

401
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:50,757
Come in.

402
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:55,888
-Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
-Okay, send them in.

403
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:05,522
You two men get in your planes
and fly over to Haleiwa.

404
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,525
Yes, sir.

405
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,694
What are our orders when we get there?

406
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,779
Just sit tight.

407
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,407
Listen for the phone. That's all.

408
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:16,909
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

409
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:28,045
Haleiwa is one
of the subsidiary fields.

410
00:43:28,296 --> 00:43:31,924
We send those two up there,
two more here.

411
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:36,053
Only way I know to disperse
a few of the planes.

412
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:42,809
If I'd get away with it, I'd send
all to the neighbor islands.

413
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:47,064
-You know why we're being transferred.
-Them poker games.

414
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:50,442
-Been winning too often.
-Yeah.

415
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:53,195
Some sucker loses his shirt,
so he bitches to the general.

416
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:54,404
That's it.

417
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:01,995
It's hard to believe
the Emperor agreed...

418
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:05,082
...to fix a date by which the
final decision must be made...

419
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,376
...between war and peace.

420
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:12,089
His majesty's signature
is a mere formality.

421
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:17,386
The cabinet is responsible for
all matters of national policy.

422
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:23,475
The Emperor recently read a poem
to his Ministers to show how he feels.

423
00:44:24,102 --> 00:44:26,895
"If all people are brethren...

424
00:44:28,773 --> 00:44:32,275
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

425
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:38,740
"If all people are brethren...

426
00:44:39,283 --> 00:44:42,619
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

427
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,043
This clearly shows how much
the Emperor wants to avoid a war.

428
00:44:52,296 --> 00:44:56,466
Yes, he has urged us to solve our
differences with Washington.

429
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:02,931
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?

430
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,601
Perhaps. But if we fail...

431
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:10,772
...if war does come...

432
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:15,152
...tell me frankly,
from the Navy's viewpoint...

433
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,488
...what are our chances
against the Americans?

434
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:23,410
If we must, we can raise havoc
with them for a year.

435
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,164
After that, I can guarantee nothing.

436
00:45:32,503 --> 00:45:35,797
Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you
will continue the negotiations.

437
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:39,342
Please remember, there is
no last word in diplomacy.

438
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:57,486
Tokyo has ignored
my repeated inquiries...

439
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:02,074
...and still has made no reply...

440
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:07,370
...to the compromise proposals
offered by Secretary Hull.

441
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:20,217
The war that I have dreaded
for so long...

442
00:46:22,386 --> 00:46:24,596
...may soon become a reality.

443
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:30,727
Nomura has offered
his resignation several times.

444
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:33,230
But Tokyo won't let him quit.

445
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:39,653
Instead they're sending a second
ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.

446
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:45,325
Do you really think
this Kurusu can do any good?

447
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:48,245
Well, I doubt it, Frank.

448
00:46:48,496 --> 00:46:50,831
He's hardly the most tactful choice.

449
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:53,208
When he was ambassador in Berlin...

450
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:56,253
...he signed the Axis Pact
on behalf of Japan.

451
00:46:57,797 --> 00:47:02,175
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay
on November 26 under my strict orders.

452
00:47:02,343 --> 00:47:05,762
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka"
will be confirmation to go on.

453
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:10,225
We have tentatively set
the date for the attack...

454
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,604
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.

455
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:22,904
But you must understand that we
are still negotiating in Washington.

456
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:27,075
If a peaceful solution is found...

457
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:30,954
...the fleet will be recalled at once.

458
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:39,796
Once at sea, to turn back
would be a disgrace!

459
00:47:40,923 --> 00:47:42,924
It would destroy the morale of the men!

460
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:47,095
They're in a high state of readiness,
physically and psychologically.

461
00:47:50,308 --> 00:47:54,311
Enough! If any commander is inclined
to reject an order to return...

462
00:47:54,979 --> 00:47:56,980
...when the path for peace is open...

463
00:47:57,565 --> 00:47:59,983
...let him resign now!

464
00:48:11,913 --> 00:48:13,705
Finally, gentlemen...

465
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:18,460
...many misinformed Japanese...

466
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:23,006
...believe that America is a
nation divided, isolationist...

467
00:48:24,842 --> 00:48:27,010
...and that Americans are
only interested...

468
00:48:28,012 --> 00:48:30,972
...in enjoying a life of luxury...

469
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:35,518
...and are spiritually
and morally corrupt.

470
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:38,772
But that is a great mistake.

471
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,859
If war becomes inevitable...

472
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:50,659
...America would be the most formidable
foe that we have ever fought.

473
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:59,668
I've lived in Washington
and studied at Harvard...

474
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:04,339
...so I know the Americans are
a proud and just people.

475
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:15,392
-You sick or something?
-No.

476
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:19,813
I've been piecing together this
batch of new intercepts.

477
00:49:20,022 --> 00:49:23,817
-A frightening picture is taking shape.
-Oh?

478
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:27,487
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu
asked their government...

479
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:32,659
...to extend a deadline for suspending
negotiation between Japan and America.

480
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,703
-You remember that?
-Yeah.

481
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:38,915
Now, according to this latest
intercept...

482
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:42,669
...Tokyo wants to conclude
negotiations with us...

483
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:45,839
...no later than November 29...

484
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:48,591
...after which, and I quote:

485
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:51,553
"Things are automatically
going to happen. "

486
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:53,096
Now...

487
00:49:53,347 --> 00:49:56,224
...look at this intelligence report
from the British.

488
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,353
Five Japanese troop transports
with naval escort...

489
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:03,940
...were sighted off Formosa,
heading south.

490
00:50:04,275 --> 00:50:08,403
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.

491
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:10,739
I'm not so sure.

492
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,373
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.

493
00:50:23,836 --> 00:50:26,588
Japan is going to attack us.

494
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:31,092
The 29th is only four days off.

495
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,804
The 30th is on a Sunday.

496
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:40,560
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday,
the 30th of November.

497
00:50:46,067 --> 00:50:48,276
The pieces fit together.

498
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:53,490
But can you prove it?

499
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:57,660
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.

500
00:50:58,871 --> 00:51:00,789
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.

501
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:03,958
Oh, General Marshall's
at Fort Benning, sir.

502
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,669
Then get me the secretary of war.

503
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:12,175
I've got the evidence, Al.

504
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:17,764
And I'm gonna make the brass
around here admit I'm right.

505
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:30,610
Bratton's analysis makes sense.

506
00:51:31,278 --> 00:51:34,447
His facts are undeniable.

507
00:51:36,283 --> 00:51:41,538
Henry, I'm washing my hands
of the whole matter.

508
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:44,290
From now on, it's in your hands...

509
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,210
...and in those
of the Navy Department.

510
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,207
I'll call the president.

511
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,212
A message declaring a full alert
will be sent out.

512
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,672
Sir?

513
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,676
General Marshall anticipated
an emergency like this.

514
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,095
Before he left to attend maneuvers...

515
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,347
...he made out this alert order.

516
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:55,212
As you know, after the Cabinet
decided to send Japan to war...

517
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,591
...they held an Imperial Conference
at the palace.

518
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,264
His Majesty, who participated
in this conference...

519
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,683
...which is a mere formality...

520
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,604
...was depressed and silent
all through the meeting.

521
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:18,193
Today His Majesty will ask
the customary questions about the war...

522
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,363
...and you will make
the traditional replies.

523
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:26,493
There can be no more tragic ritual
than this conversation...

524
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,289
...between His Majesty
who does not want war...

525
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:34,168
...and Your Excellency,
who has opposed it so vigorously.

526
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:39,506
As Minister of the Imperial Household...

527
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,801
...I am not allowed to attend this ritual.

528
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,803
Fortunately for me...

529
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,142
...I won't have to witness
this tragic ceremony.

530
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,985
I can go no farther.

531
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,781
The Military Attaché will
take you from here.

532
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,904
Sir, a message!

533
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,289
"From Admiral Yamamoto,
Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet...

534
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,834
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...

535
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,962
...climb Mount Niitaka. "

536
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:49,303
Hostilities will begin
on December 7th...

537
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,349
...exactly as scheduled.

538
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:04,387
Read this back to me.

539
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:12,061
"Japanese future action unpredictable.

540
00:56:12,312 --> 00:56:15,731
But hostile action possible
at any moment.

541
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:18,359
If hostilities cannot be avoided...

542
00:56:18,568 --> 00:56:22,488
...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act. "

543
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:25,366
Wait a minute. Read that again.

544
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:32,915
"If hostilities cannot be avoided,
the United States desires...

545
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:36,919
...that Japan commit
the first overt act.

546
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:41,715
This shouldn't be construed
as restricting you...

547
00:56:41,925 --> 00:56:45,719
...to a course of action
jeopardizing your defense.

548
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:48,889
Prior to hostile Japanese action...

549
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:52,017
...you are directed to undertake
reconnaissance...

550
00:56:52,227 --> 00:56:55,312
...and other measures
as you deem necessary.

551
00:56:55,522 --> 00:56:57,606
These measures should be
carried out...

552
00:56:57,858 --> 00:57:00,234
...so as not to alarm
the civil population...

553
00:57:00,444 --> 00:57:04,905
...or disclose intent. By order
of General George C. Marshall. "

554
00:57:05,365 --> 00:57:08,409
"Not to alarm the civil population. "

555
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:11,120
What do you make of it?

556
00:57:12,956 --> 00:57:14,248
Well...

557
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:18,461
...if you ask me, sir,
it's double talk.

558
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:23,591
But the chief of staff doesn't go in
for double talk.

559
00:57:25,385 --> 00:57:27,094
-We're going on alert.
-Again?

560
00:57:27,345 --> 00:57:30,139
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.

561
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,309
-Damn it, unconfuse them.
-Yes, sir.

562
00:57:35,479 --> 00:57:38,063
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

563
00:57:38,273 --> 00:57:41,609
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo.

564
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:46,113
This dispatch is to be considered
a war warning. "

565
00:57:49,784 --> 00:57:51,660
Well, there it is, gentlemen.

566
00:57:53,163 --> 00:57:56,290
You now have
as much information as I do.

567
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:58,959
That's the second warning
in three days.

568
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:01,921
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

569
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,173
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo. "

570
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:05,508
They don't mention us.

571
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:09,637
That's correct. I think it should be
considered significant.

572
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:12,264
Well, gentlemen...

573
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:15,935
...we have a job to do.

574
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:19,772
Washington wants us to send
a squadron of fighters to Midway.

575
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:23,400
And another squadron to Wake.

576
00:58:23,693 --> 00:58:25,319
When can you sail?

577
00:58:26,279 --> 00:58:30,157
Well, the Enterprise can sail
tomorrow morning.

578
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:36,455
I'll need a day or two. We're just
completing repairs on the Lexington.

579
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:38,415
Hurry things along, John.

580
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:40,501
I want you out there to probe.

581
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,546
I want planes up in the air
morning and afternoon.

582
00:58:43,713 --> 00:58:47,299
I want a report on any sign
of hostile ships.

583
00:58:47,509 --> 00:58:48,551
Understood.

584
00:58:49,135 --> 00:58:50,511
Do you want battleships along?

585
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,513
Hell, no. They're too slow.

586
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:54,682
If we're gonna probe, let's probe.

587
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:57,059
We don't want anything holding us up.

588
00:58:57,227 --> 00:59:00,813
You're right, but I'm not ready
to commit them myself.

589
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:02,856
Not until I know when and where.

590
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:06,402
Do you plan to keep half the fleet
at sea while the carriers are gone?

591
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,571
No, it's too risky.

592
00:59:08,738 --> 00:59:12,324
I'll have to keep the fleet
here at Pearl while you're away.

593
00:59:12,534 --> 00:59:15,369
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.

594
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:19,707
I don't like the idea of having my
battleships without air cover.

595
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,669
-Let's get going.
Yes, sir.

596
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:26,422
Admiral.

597
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,054
Kim.

598
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:36,932
Level with me.

599
00:59:38,184 --> 00:59:40,060
I want a clear directive.

600
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:44,356
If I run into a Jap ship,
what action do I take?

601
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,986
Use your common sense.

602
00:59:52,407 --> 00:59:55,075
That's the best damn order I ever had.

603
00:59:58,413 --> 01:00:02,708
If I see so much as a sampan there...

604
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:04,501
...I'll blow it out of the water.

605
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:22,311
"Intelligence Report,
U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor...

606
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:25,772
...six battleships, three light cruisers...

607
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:28,317
...16 destroyers and one
aircraft carrier. "

608
01:00:30,778 --> 01:00:33,780
No information about
the other American carriers.

609
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,541
You know today's date?

610
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:46,460
December 1st.

611
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:50,714
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.

612
01:00:52,342 --> 01:00:55,969
When we cross
the International Date Line...

613
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:58,680
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...

614
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:03,602
...and turn the calendar back a full day,
making today yesterday.

615
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,731
Don't be silly!
Today can't change into yesterday!

616
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:16,740
You're not too intelligent
but I'll try to explain...

617
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:22,746
...so listen carefully.
It's a little before 1300 hours, right?

618
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:25,499
So why are we making supper
at this hour?

619
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:31,797
1300? It should be lunchtime.

620
01:01:31,965 --> 01:01:37,511
Right! And the Date Line makes up
for that time difference...

621
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,098
...by turning today into yesterday.

622
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:47,396
I don't quite understand, but if we
see the enemy across that line...

623
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:50,774
...I guess it would be useless
to shoot at them.

624
01:01:51,693 --> 01:01:56,196
Because how can today's shells
hit yesterday's enemy?

625
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:19,428
What is it this time,
getting me over here?

626
01:02:19,637 --> 01:02:22,472
Tokyo has alerted their embassy
to stand by...

627
01:02:22,682 --> 01:02:26,143
...for a very long message
in 14 parts.

628
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:30,147
Look, Rufe, you scared me
and everybody else last week.

629
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:32,691
We're not doing that again, are we?

630
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,026
You should see this.

631
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:37,738
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.

632
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:43,910
Remember those troop ships?

633
01:02:44,162 --> 01:02:46,538
They're still heading south
with an escort...

634
01:02:46,748 --> 01:02:50,042
...only 14 hours
from the coast of Malaya.

635
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:55,005
What about their aircraft carriers?

636
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:56,715
We don't know.

637
01:02:57,425 --> 01:03:00,969
Intelligence was keeping track
of them until recently.

638
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:03,013
Now we've lost them.

639
01:03:03,473 --> 01:03:07,476
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself
in their minds.

640
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:11,855
Where do you think I have been
the past week, night and day?

641
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,026
I am still convinced
they're going to attack us.

642
01:03:18,112 --> 01:03:20,322
What can we do
that we aren't doing already?

643
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:25,452
I don't know about you,
but I know what I'm gonna do.

644
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:28,872
Where is everybody?

645
01:03:29,123 --> 01:03:31,750
Oh, it's past 12, sir.
They've already gone.

646
01:03:31,959 --> 01:03:33,960
-Get them back.
-On the weekend?

647
01:03:34,212 --> 01:03:36,046
Yes, on the weekend.

648
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:44,555
"Only specially screened members
of your communications staff...

649
01:03:45,682 --> 01:03:49,351
...are to be permitted to process
the 14-part message...

650
01:03:49,853 --> 01:03:53,439
...and prepare the typed translation. "

651
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:02,656
It will be difficult without
the help of a skilled typist.

652
01:04:03,366 --> 01:04:06,035
The situation right now
is extremely delicate.

653
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,079
We must be prepared...

654
01:04:09,247 --> 01:04:13,208
...to have each part of the message
decoded as soon as it comes in.

655
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:16,253
I'll alert the code room.

656
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:29,975
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.

657
01:04:43,114 --> 01:04:46,742
From Point D proceed to Point E.
Battle speed.

658
01:05:15,522 --> 01:05:17,648
So this is the sound of Hawaii?

659
01:05:29,285 --> 01:05:33,831
Disappointing news, our main targets,
the American carriers...

660
01:05:34,332 --> 01:05:36,625
...have left Pearl Harbor.

661
01:05:44,342 --> 01:05:46,093
This completes 13 parts?

662
01:05:46,302 --> 01:05:49,930
Yes, Tokyo is holding
the final part till morning.

663
01:05:50,557 --> 01:05:52,349
I wonder why.

664
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:55,686
It's almost 9.

665
01:05:55,979 --> 01:05:59,773
Harry, I'm going to make the
rounds with what we have here.

666
01:05:59,983 --> 01:06:03,152
Thank God the president's
back on the list.

667
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:07,698
Have Brotherhood call me
when the missing part comes in.

668
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:09,324
Right.

669
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,721
You're late.

670
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:34,183
-Well, I was-
-Please, take me to the White House.

671
01:06:44,569 --> 01:06:48,739
If you told me we were invited to the
White House, I would've dressed.

672
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:51,992
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.

673
01:06:52,202 --> 01:06:55,537
She's informal personally,
but a stickler for protocol-

674
01:06:55,747 --> 01:06:58,665
Darling, will you shut up and drive?

675
01:07:37,622 --> 01:07:38,914
Once more!

676
01:07:46,923 --> 01:07:48,632
Steady.

677
01:07:56,307 --> 01:07:57,599
Steady.

678
01:08:04,649 --> 01:08:07,150
Great! We just sank the Nevada!

679
01:08:12,824 --> 01:08:14,157
Pennsylvania!

680
01:08:17,662 --> 01:08:19,288
Oklahoma!

681
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:27,963
No, you idiot!
It's your own flagship!

682
01:08:42,854 --> 01:08:44,354
Well?

683
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:46,732
Captain Wilkinson's.

684
01:08:53,156 --> 01:08:54,823
Did you see the president?

685
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:58,744
No, I saw Harry Hopkins.

686
01:08:58,953 --> 01:09:01,163
And did he read the whatever it is?

687
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:04,708
No, he doesn't have the key.

688
01:09:05,668 --> 01:09:08,462
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lieutenant Schulz.

689
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:10,672
He took it in to the president.

690
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:13,884
And the president has a key,
I suppose?

691
01:09:15,386 --> 01:09:17,012
Of course he has.

692
01:09:17,639 --> 01:09:20,390
And did Lieutenant Schulz
say anything?

693
01:09:20,725 --> 01:09:22,184
He said, "Thank you. "

694
01:09:22,894 --> 01:09:25,145
Darling, step on it, will you?

695
01:09:32,904 --> 01:09:36,907
If we can see nothing, then neither
can American patrol planes.

696
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,160
I'm more concerned about
a submarine detecting us.

697
01:09:52,674 --> 01:09:54,758
Dead on schedule.

698
01:10:04,894 --> 01:10:08,689
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should I take it to chief of staff?

699
01:10:08,898 --> 01:10:12,943
It's after 10, General Marshall
always retires early.

700
01:10:21,327 --> 01:10:26,123
I see no reason to disturb Marshall
with something that's incomplete.

701
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:31,294
-Wait till you have the final part.
-Yes, sir.

702
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:32,879
If you're so concerned...

703
01:10:33,089 --> 01:10:36,258
...why don't we call chief of war plans,
Admiral Turner?

704
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:39,094
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.

705
01:10:39,303 --> 01:10:42,431
-You don't happen to know where he is?
-No idea.

706
01:10:53,276 --> 01:10:57,070
The president has already
discussed it with me.

707
01:10:57,321 --> 01:11:00,282
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

708
01:11:00,491 --> 01:11:04,786
But when the final part of this
comes in, I'd like to see it then.

709
01:11:04,996 --> 01:11:08,373
-Good night, commander.
-Good night, sir.

710
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,968
I was starved. I'll bet you are.

711
01:11:20,178 --> 01:11:22,345
Oh, thank you, dear.

712
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,018
Can't you tell me anything?

713
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:29,686
Even a hint?

714
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:37,277
You'd think the world
was falling apart.

715
01:11:37,487 --> 01:11:40,363
Admiral Stark talked to the president.

716
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:43,450
What did the president say?

717
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:49,706
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

718
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,363
Gordy. Ed.

719
01:12:21,572 --> 01:12:24,699
We got those B-17s coming in
from California in the morning.

720
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:27,661
Honolulu radio will stay on
the air all night...

721
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,329
...so the planes can home in.

722
01:12:29,539 --> 01:12:33,333
You and I had better be in that
control tower at 7:30 sharp.

723
01:12:33,543 --> 01:12:35,460
-Yes, sir.
-Dear.

724
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:47,514
-Tyler, I've got a job for you.
-Sir.

725
01:12:47,723 --> 01:12:51,601
Report to the new radar center
at Fort Shafter at 0400.

726
01:12:51,769 --> 01:12:53,603
At 4:00 in the morning?

727
01:12:53,855 --> 01:12:55,605
From 4 to 7 a. m.

728
01:12:55,857 --> 01:12:58,984
Our marvel of science
only operates for three hours.

729
01:12:59,193 --> 01:13:01,778
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!

730
01:13:13,749 --> 01:13:16,626
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.

731
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:18,920
Just fine, Mr. Young.

732
01:13:23,092 --> 01:13:26,303
In fact, I think
I'll turn in for a while.

733
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:34,019
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.

734
01:13:42,653 --> 01:13:46,489
The Commander-in-Chief
has sent a message...

735
01:13:46,657 --> 01:13:49,284
...wishing us good luck.

736
01:13:49,952 --> 01:13:53,496
That, plus the Imperial Proclamation...

737
01:13:53,664 --> 01:13:58,043
...has undoubtedly stirred
your loyalty to the Empire.

738
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:02,005
The success of this mission...

739
01:14:02,173 --> 01:14:05,175
...depends on surprise.
If we achieve it...

740
01:14:06,052 --> 01:14:09,262
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora,"
will be sent out.

741
01:14:11,265 --> 01:14:15,852
Now that the hour for battle
draws near...

742
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:20,482
...I will not burden you
with the usual pep talk.

743
01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:25,695
Instead I shall hoist
the famous "Z" flag...

744
01:14:27,365 --> 01:14:32,452
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief
Togo led his fleet to victory...

745
01:14:33,162 --> 01:14:35,705
...in the historic battle
against the Russians.

746
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:28,550
Here you are.

747
01:15:29,427 --> 01:15:30,510
Kramer.

748
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,262
Al, listen to this.

749
01:15:32,513 --> 01:15:34,055
The fourteenth part.

750
01:15:34,265 --> 01:15:36,933
"Will the ambassadors please
submit our reply...

751
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:40,770
...to the United States government
at precisely 1 p. m...

752
01:15:41,063 --> 01:15:43,064
...December 7th, your time. "

753
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:45,025
1 p. m.?

754
01:15:45,276 --> 01:15:49,154
"Precisely 1 p. m., your time. "

755
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:51,781
I'll be right over.

756
01:16:10,926 --> 01:16:14,429
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.

757
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:17,474
As you know, communications
have been delayed...

758
01:16:17,683 --> 01:16:19,392
...and frequently garbled lately.

759
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:22,312
Or deliberately interfered with.

760
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:28,985
Gene, call the foreign minister.

761
01:16:30,988 --> 01:16:34,407
Tell him I want an immediate
audience with the emperor.

762
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:40,497
Why is this so important?

763
01:16:41,165 --> 01:16:43,958
Does this Roosevelt message
say anything new?

764
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,720
It merely proposes
a heart-to-heart exchange...

765
01:16:56,347 --> 01:16:58,473
...between the two Chiefs of State.

766
01:17:00,601 --> 01:17:02,977
It could start negotiations afresh.

767
01:17:13,322 --> 01:17:14,864
It's too late for that.

768
01:17:17,118 --> 01:17:21,538
It's just as well the message
didn't come a day or two earlier.

769
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:27,710
What do I tell Ambassador Grew?

770
01:17:28,379 --> 01:17:30,380
You are Foreign Minister!

771
01:17:31,465 --> 01:17:34,342
Report to the palace alone
with the message.

772
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:41,516
"After deciphering...

773
01:17:43,185 --> 01:17:45,061
...part 14...

774
01:17:46,522 --> 01:17:48,690
...destroy at once...

775
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:55,196
...your cipher machine...

776
01:17:56,907 --> 01:17:58,908
...all codes...

777
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:04,247
...and secret documents. "

778
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,292
Translate this immediately.

779
01:18:07,501 --> 01:18:10,086
-Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
-Yes, sir.

780
01:18:10,296 --> 01:18:12,088
I've got to get the hell out of here.

781
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,587
Hey, look at this.

782
01:19:35,381 --> 01:19:37,298
Finally got one.

783
01:19:42,346 --> 01:19:43,513
Communication center.

784
01:19:43,681 --> 01:19:44,847
It even works.

785
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:46,307
That's great.

786
01:19:46,517 --> 01:19:49,143
Opana Point, communications check.

787
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:52,355
Are you reading us?

788
01:19:52,523 --> 01:19:54,649
Coming in loud and clear.

789
01:19:59,613 --> 01:20:00,697
Where's the general?

790
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:02,865
It's Sunday, sir.

791
01:20:17,631 --> 01:20:19,132
This is Colonel Bratton.

792
01:20:19,383 --> 01:20:22,343
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.

793
01:20:22,553 --> 01:20:25,722
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.

794
01:20:30,477 --> 01:20:33,396
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.

795
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:35,857
Yes, Colonel Bratton.

796
01:20:37,067 --> 01:20:39,569
I'm sorry, sir,
the general isn't here.

797
01:20:40,446 --> 01:20:43,364
Where he always is
this time Sunday morning.

798
01:21:00,424 --> 01:21:03,509
-Where's Colonel Bratton?
-Gone to see General Marshall.

799
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:05,762
He left this for you, sir.

800
01:21:39,338 --> 01:21:41,297
Here is another part of the message, sir.

801
01:21:53,143 --> 01:21:57,814
We are instructed to submit
the message at 1:00 p. m. today.

802
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:02,985
One p. m.?

803
01:22:05,531 --> 01:22:09,117
The 14th part of this intercept
Kramer just delivered...

804
01:22:09,284 --> 01:22:12,286
...indicates to me
the Japanese are going to attack.

805
01:22:13,956 --> 01:22:16,499
None of us doubt that war is coming.

806
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:20,294
We know they have
an expeditionary force heading south.

807
01:22:21,338 --> 01:22:24,632
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...

808
01:22:24,842 --> 01:22:27,176
...I recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel...

809
01:22:27,428 --> 01:22:29,137
...in Hawaii.

810
01:22:46,947 --> 01:22:48,364
No.

811
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:52,952
I better call the president first.

812
01:22:55,372 --> 01:22:57,457
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?

813
01:22:57,666 --> 01:23:00,585
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

814
01:26:14,738 --> 01:26:18,699
The men are in good spirits, sir.
They are eager to go.

815
01:26:21,244 --> 01:26:25,081
Yes, they are eager because they
do not know the taste of battle.

816
01:27:09,251 --> 01:27:13,379
The mechanics asked me to give you
this for good Luck at Pearl Harbor.

817
01:28:27,245 --> 01:28:28,996
Bring her into the wind.

818
01:32:06,298 --> 01:32:09,258
"The Japanese government regrets
to have to notify...

819
01:32:09,426 --> 01:32:11,302
...the American government...

820
01:32:11,553 --> 01:32:14,596
...that, in view of the attitude
of the American government...

821
01:32:14,764 --> 01:32:17,850
...it cannot but consider
that it is impossible to reach...

822
01:32:18,018 --> 01:32:20,352
...an agreement
through further negotiations. "

823
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,603
-Sir.
-Hm?

824
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:24,940
-There are supplemental messages.
-Thank you.

825
01:32:36,202 --> 01:32:39,413
Gentlemen, I am convinced
the Japanese intend to attack...

826
01:32:39,622 --> 01:32:42,082
...at or shortly after 1:00 today.

827
01:32:42,292 --> 01:32:45,336
-I'll alert all Pacific commands.
-Yes, sir.

828
01:32:55,597 --> 01:32:57,973
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.

829
01:32:58,308 --> 01:33:00,851
Take this to communications center.

830
01:33:20,789 --> 01:33:23,165
We will follow that ship
into Pearl Harbor.

831
01:33:33,843 --> 01:33:35,344
Come in.

832
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:38,180
Captain, can you come to the bridge?

833
01:33:38,348 --> 01:33:39,973
Very well.

834
01:33:44,687 --> 01:33:46,188
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?

835
01:33:46,398 --> 01:33:47,856
-We're not sure.
-What ship?

836
01:33:48,066 --> 01:33:50,192
The Navy tug Antares.

837
01:33:51,486 --> 01:33:53,028
Look astern of her, captain.

838
01:33:54,364 --> 01:33:56,073
OUTERBRIDGE:
She's towing a target raft.

839
01:33:56,366 --> 01:33:58,784
Look between the ship
and the raft, sir.

840
01:34:08,503 --> 01:34:10,838
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.

841
01:34:11,047 --> 01:34:14,383
She's sneaking through the net
into the harbor. General Quarters.

842
01:34:14,551 --> 01:34:17,219
-Sound General Quarters.
-All engines ahead, full.

843
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:39,908
-Come left 15 degrees.
Come left 15 degrees, sir.

844
01:34:40,243 --> 01:34:43,120
-Tell Antares we're attacking.
-Aye, aye, sir.

845
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:50,711
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.

846
01:34:58,261 --> 01:35:01,430
-Mount one, commence firing.
-Mount one, commence firing.

847
01:35:20,617 --> 01:35:23,994
-Stand by to roll depth charges.
-Stand by to roll depth charges.

848
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,876
-Roll one.
Roll one.

849
01:35:39,135 --> 01:35:41,303
-Roll two.
Roll two.

850
01:35:55,652 --> 01:36:00,113
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges
on a sub in our security zone.

851
01:36:00,323 --> 01:36:01,823
Aye, aye, sir.

852
01:36:21,177 --> 01:36:22,678
Captain Earle speaking.

853
01:36:23,179 --> 01:36:26,932
-We have a message from the ward.
-All right, read it to me.

854
01:36:27,725 --> 01:36:33,021
"Have dropped depth charges on sub
operating in our security zone. "

855
01:36:34,315 --> 01:36:37,568
We've had so many of these
false sightings, Kaminsky.

856
01:36:37,819 --> 01:36:39,570
But this is the real thing, sir.

857
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:41,738
Closer than any previous sighting.

858
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:43,448
Just off the harbor entrance.

859
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:47,744
You and I know the skipper
of that destroyer is a green kid.

860
01:36:47,996 --> 01:36:49,371
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.

861
01:36:49,581 --> 01:36:53,584
With all due respect, sir, I think
we should alert all commanders.

862
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:59,381
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.

863
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:26,199
The sunburst reminds me
of our flag, a good omen.

864
01:37:50,266 --> 01:37:52,434
Ed, this is hot.

865
01:37:52,644 --> 01:37:56,313
General Marshall wants it sent to
all commanders by the fastest route.

866
01:37:56,564 --> 01:37:58,023
Right.

867
01:38:01,611 --> 01:38:05,030
The general's handwriting,
it's hard to read.

868
01:38:06,783 --> 01:38:09,242
You're gonna have to help me
with it, Rufe.

869
01:39:03,673 --> 01:39:06,174
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu
on the radio.

870
01:39:06,843 --> 01:39:09,010
Check your direction-finder dial.

871
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:15,016
It's coming from five degrees
to port, sir.

872
01:39:16,185 --> 01:39:18,353
Okay, keep riding that beam.

873
01:39:42,336 --> 01:39:46,006
Major, I picked up
some great music from Honolulu.

874
01:39:46,424 --> 01:39:48,633
That's fine, pipe it through.

875
01:39:51,763 --> 01:39:52,929
Okay.

876
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:10,572
Where's the damn chow truck?

877
01:40:13,242 --> 01:40:16,244
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.

878
01:40:16,454 --> 01:40:18,371
Hey, Joe, come here.

879
01:40:19,081 --> 01:40:20,582
What do you make of that?

880
01:40:20,792 --> 01:40:22,751
I've been watching it for minutes.

881
01:40:22,919 --> 01:40:24,753
It's moving in, fast.

882
01:40:24,962 --> 01:40:27,088
I've never seen anything that big.

883
01:40:27,381 --> 01:40:30,300
-Looks like two main pulses.
-Hey, Joe, I got it.

884
01:40:30,551 --> 01:40:35,722
I make that about 140 miles north,
three degrees east.

885
01:40:36,599 --> 01:40:39,559
Don't make sense,
we got no planes out that far.

886
01:40:39,894 --> 01:40:41,937
We gotta contact
the information center.

887
01:40:42,188 --> 01:40:44,272
Our problem is over at 7:00.

888
01:40:44,482 --> 01:40:47,108
The center might make
some sense out of it.

889
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,778
Okay, suit yourself.

890
01:40:59,622 --> 01:41:01,456
Information center.

891
01:41:02,542 --> 01:41:06,336
Yeah? I don't know, Mac,
we're all closed down here.

892
01:41:07,129 --> 01:41:09,339
Is that right? Hang on a minute.

893
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:11,299
Lieutenant, sir.

894
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:19,975
Lieutenant Tyler.

895
01:41:20,142 --> 01:41:22,727
Sir, this is Private Elliot,
Opana Point.

896
01:41:22,937 --> 01:41:25,355
There's a large formation
of planes coming in...

897
01:41:25,606 --> 01:41:28,358
...140 miles, three degrees east.

898
01:41:28,651 --> 01:41:30,151
Yeah?

899
01:41:31,028 --> 01:41:34,614
Well, don't worry about it.

900
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:40,161
The boys at Opana Point must have
picked up the B-17s...

901
01:41:40,371 --> 01:41:41,997
...coming in from the mainland.

902
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:47,460
-He said not to worry about it.
-Come on, let's go eat.

903
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:59,514
Colonel, I sent this to Manila,
the canal zone and San Francisco...

904
01:41:59,682 --> 01:42:02,350
...but the direct channel
to Hawaii is out.

905
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,185
Atmospherics again?

906
01:42:04,395 --> 01:42:07,147
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.

907
01:42:07,356 --> 01:42:09,566
We could give it to the Navy.

908
01:42:09,817 --> 01:42:12,819
What makes you think
their atmospherics are better?

909
01:42:15,031 --> 01:42:18,199
-Send it as a telegram.
-Yes, sir.

910
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:30,045
Our ultimatum should be delivered in
Washington before the attack begins.

911
01:42:33,007 --> 01:42:34,799
I hope everything is on schedule.

912
01:42:35,301 --> 01:42:37,385
Don't worry, sir.
The Emperor insists...

913
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,014
...that we follow the rules
of the Geneva Convention.

914
01:42:41,349 --> 01:42:43,391
Our declaration of war
will be delivered...

915
01:42:43,851 --> 01:42:46,728
...at 1:00 p. m.,
30 minutes before the attack begins.

916
01:43:11,337 --> 01:43:14,255
The typing still isn't finished.

917
01:43:15,841 --> 01:43:20,053
We'll have to postpone our 1:00
appointment with Secretary Hull.

918
01:43:23,599 --> 01:43:27,060
Do you mean a submarine was
sighted over half an hour ago...

919
01:43:27,269 --> 01:43:30,438
...and that it's taken
this long to report it to me?

920
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,776
I don't care if it
still hasn't been confirmed.

921
01:43:34,944 --> 01:43:38,738
I should've been informed after
the ward radioed a first report.

922
01:43:38,948 --> 01:43:42,784
A submarine that close is a serious matter.
A very serious matter.

923
01:43:42,952 --> 01:43:45,787
Get the confirmation,
all the reports to my office.

924
01:43:45,955 --> 01:43:49,374
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.

925
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:51,126
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...

926
01:43:51,377 --> 01:43:54,295
...should I tell General Short
you'll miss the golf date?

927
01:43:54,505 --> 01:43:57,465
No, damn it, get my car.

928
01:44:03,305 --> 01:44:05,640
A message for the general
at Fort Shafter.

929
01:44:05,891 --> 01:44:08,476
-Is it marked urgent?
-No.

930
01:45:01,072 --> 01:45:02,947
It's a little bumpy, Davey...

931
01:45:03,157 --> 01:45:05,492
...but you have to fly
in all kinds of weather.

932
01:45:05,701 --> 01:45:07,452
Sure, Miss Fort.

933
01:45:25,054 --> 01:45:27,013
Don't let the nose drop.

934
01:45:27,223 --> 01:45:31,351
That's better.
You're doing just fine.

935
01:45:51,122 --> 01:45:53,414
I'm taking over, Davey.

936
01:46:14,311 --> 01:46:19,107
Warrant Officer Mizuki,
signal all planes, "prepare to attack. "

937
01:46:25,239 --> 01:46:28,575
A signal from Fuchida,
"objective sighted, preparing to attack. "

938
01:47:14,455 --> 01:47:16,372
Everything is strangely quiet.

939
01:47:18,334 --> 01:47:22,170
The American anti-aircraft
batteries haven't fired a shot!

940
01:47:26,634 --> 01:47:29,385
And no enemy fighters
over the harbor, sir!

941
01:47:35,184 --> 01:47:36,851
We've done it!

942
01:47:40,356 --> 01:47:43,524
Send the message:
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

943
01:47:49,615 --> 01:47:51,241
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

944
01:48:52,094 --> 01:48:53,886
Stand by.

945
01:49:59,745 --> 01:50:01,329
Execute.

946
01:50:59,513 --> 01:51:02,723
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.

947
01:51:37,259 --> 01:51:38,593
Come on!

948
01:51:44,224 --> 01:51:46,934
Alert all commands:

949
01:51:48,061 --> 01:51:51,063
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.

950
01:51:51,732 --> 01:51:54,358
This is no drill. "

951
01:52:24,348 --> 01:52:27,016
General Quarters. General Quarters.

952
01:52:27,768 --> 01:52:31,270
Man your stations. Man your stations.

953
01:52:37,694 --> 01:52:38,986
Sir.

954
01:52:56,505 --> 01:52:58,839
Battle stations. Battle stations.

955
01:53:07,349 --> 01:53:10,851
Fire your gun. Fire at will.

956
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,562
That bastard!

957
01:53:30,539 --> 01:53:33,165
Station six, man your pump.

958
01:53:44,344 --> 01:53:45,595
Plane to starboard.

959
01:53:53,353 --> 01:53:55,396
You bastard!

960
01:54:00,694 --> 01:54:02,278
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.

961
01:54:02,529 --> 01:54:05,072
-Pearl Harbor?
-Pearl Harbor is being bombed.

962
01:54:05,282 --> 01:54:06,866
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

963
01:54:07,075 --> 01:54:10,369
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

964
01:54:52,954 --> 01:54:55,289
What in the hell is going on?

965
01:54:56,458 --> 01:54:58,334
Why wasn't the Army notified?

966
01:54:58,585 --> 01:55:02,963
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.

967
01:55:03,256 --> 01:55:05,466
-General.
-Put all units on a full war footing.

968
01:55:05,634 --> 01:55:07,259
Alert the territorial guard.

969
01:55:07,469 --> 01:55:09,178
Open a command post
at Aliamanu Crater.

970
01:55:09,429 --> 01:55:11,305
-Yes, sir.
-I'll be right down.

971
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:19,355
Oh, my God.

972
01:55:20,273 --> 01:55:21,440
The island's under attack.

973
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:24,151
Those bastards will kill us all.

974
01:55:25,654 --> 01:55:28,155
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.

975
01:55:28,323 --> 01:55:30,449
-You too, lieutenant.
-Yes, sir.

976
01:55:36,957 --> 01:55:39,333
-Operator.
-Duarte Air Field.

977
01:55:39,501 --> 01:55:41,627
All the phone lines are jammed.

978
01:55:41,837 --> 01:55:44,130
Well, try the radio again.

979
01:56:14,161 --> 01:56:15,202
Hose down that plane.

980
01:56:29,968 --> 01:56:31,051
Run for it.

981
01:56:31,261 --> 01:56:32,928
Run, run!

982
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:41,729
There's Hickam.

983
01:56:41,897 --> 01:56:45,065
Major, I heard something
funny on the Honolulu radio.

984
01:56:49,863 --> 01:56:51,697
What kind of traffic control is this?

985
01:56:51,907 --> 01:56:54,158
The radio said
something about an attack.

986
01:56:54,367 --> 01:56:55,910
They're Japs, sir.

987
01:56:59,915 --> 01:57:03,793
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.

988
01:57:04,044 --> 01:57:05,878
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.

989
01:57:06,087 --> 01:57:09,089
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.

990
01:57:09,299 --> 01:57:12,760
Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam,
try Bellows or Wheeler.

991
01:57:24,314 --> 01:57:26,398
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.

992
01:57:26,608 --> 01:57:28,067
They shot one circuit box.

993
01:57:28,276 --> 01:57:30,277
The landing light isn't working.

994
01:57:30,445 --> 01:57:32,613
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.

995
01:57:56,596 --> 01:57:58,138
-Major.
-Yeah.

996
01:57:58,306 --> 01:57:59,515
One wheel is stuck.

997
01:57:59,975 --> 01:58:02,476
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.

998
01:58:02,769 --> 01:58:04,812
-I tried.
-Try again!

999
01:58:08,316 --> 01:58:10,526
Here they come. Fire!

1000
01:58:17,492 --> 01:58:20,160
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.

1001
01:58:27,335 --> 01:58:29,628
Major, no go, sir.

1002
01:58:31,673 --> 01:58:34,842
Like I said, it's a hell of a way
to fly into a war.

1003
01:59:01,870 --> 01:59:03,329
-Run for it!
-Hurry up!

1004
01:59:06,875 --> 01:59:09,043
Tower to B-17,
there's a Jap on your tail.

1005
01:59:09,336 --> 01:59:11,045
Goose your engine and get out.

1006
02:00:49,978 --> 02:00:52,646
Have damage control report
all damages.

1007
02:00:52,814 --> 02:00:55,315
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.

1008
02:00:55,483 --> 02:00:57,818
Okay, sergeant,
let's get the men down.

1009
02:00:57,986 --> 02:01:00,029
All right, you guys, let's go.

1010
02:01:00,488 --> 02:01:02,823
Where the hell are our fighters?

1011
02:01:26,222 --> 02:01:29,850
Captain, the main fuel tanks
are fractured.

1012
02:01:30,143 --> 02:01:32,436
Lower deck's flooded,
we're listing eight degrees.

1013
02:01:32,645 --> 02:01:34,438
Counter flood, counter flood.

1014
02:01:44,949 --> 02:01:47,868
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.

1015
02:01:48,036 --> 02:01:49,870
There's your confirmation!

1016
02:01:57,462 --> 02:01:59,546
"Oklahoma, capsized.

1017
02:02:00,882 --> 02:02:03,842
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward
and is down to a head.

1018
02:02:04,052 --> 02:02:08,180
West Virginia, subjected to six
torpedo hits and several deck fires.

1019
02:02:08,389 --> 02:02:10,891
Raleigh and Helena
damaged and listing. "

1020
02:02:11,059 --> 02:02:16,063
The California, two torpedoes, fires
all around, temporarily abandoned.

1021
02:02:16,231 --> 02:02:17,272
I've just come from her.

1022
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:32,264
It's spent, sir.

1023
02:03:39,814 --> 02:03:42,316
Would've been merciful had it killed me.

1024
02:03:53,286 --> 02:03:55,204
A message from
Flight Leader Fuchida.

1025
02:03:55,622 --> 02:03:59,166
"Have inflicted serious damage
on numerous battleships. "

1026
02:04:17,227 --> 02:04:18,685
Better than we had dreamed!

1027
02:04:26,527 --> 02:04:28,362
Where are our priority targets...

1028
02:04:30,198 --> 02:04:32,366
...the American carriers?

1029
02:04:36,871 --> 02:04:38,497
Mr. Secretary.

1030
02:04:40,708 --> 02:04:44,878
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill. "

1031
02:04:45,171 --> 02:04:48,423
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.

1032
02:04:48,675 --> 02:04:51,885
No, sir. It's Pearl.

1033
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:56,390
Get me the White House,
the direct line.

1034
02:04:56,641 --> 02:04:58,058
Yes, sir.

1035
02:05:03,398 --> 02:05:07,734
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you
in a moment. Please be seated.

1036
02:05:12,407 --> 02:05:16,243
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?

1037
02:05:16,452 --> 02:05:19,454
Then, sir,
I'd like you to have it confirmed...

1038
02:05:19,706 --> 02:05:23,667
...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu.

1039
02:05:23,876 --> 02:05:25,544
They're waiting outside.

1040
02:06:26,814 --> 02:06:31,318
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.

1041
02:06:31,527 --> 02:06:35,030
George, get a hold of a car,
a truck, anything.

1042
02:06:35,281 --> 02:06:38,658
I'm calling Haleiwa to get them
to start our planes. Go.

1043
02:06:38,868 --> 02:06:39,993
Right!

1044
02:08:39,405 --> 02:08:41,448
Battleship on the Left, sir!

1045
02:08:48,956 --> 02:08:52,459
It's the Nevada. She's making
a run for the sea!

1046
02:08:53,377 --> 02:08:57,631
If we sink her in the channel,
the harbor will be blocked for months!

1047
02:09:08,142 --> 02:09:10,685
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.

1048
02:09:10,978 --> 02:09:14,147
-Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.
-Stay at 2-3-0, sir.

1049
02:10:00,861 --> 02:10:02,195
Take cover!

1050
02:10:18,838 --> 02:10:20,463
More hose! More hose!

1051
02:10:34,979 --> 02:10:39,065
More water. More! More water.

1052
02:10:39,692 --> 02:10:42,611
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

1053
02:10:54,915 --> 02:10:59,127
-Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
-Over the side!

1054
02:11:03,424 --> 02:11:06,092
Can't get through
the outer channel in this shape.

1055
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:09,262
She goes down here,
she'll block the south channel.

1056
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:11,765
We'll have to beach her there
so she's clear.

1057
02:14:58,033 --> 02:14:59,492
File these.

1058
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,340
G-5.

1059
02:15:20,681 --> 02:15:22,682
I need five copies each.

1060
02:15:25,185 --> 02:15:26,769
Messenger.

1061
02:15:28,856 --> 02:15:31,524
-Take this to General Short's office.
-Right.

1062
02:15:32,860 --> 02:15:34,360
File these.

1063
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,375
Corporal.

1064
02:15:49,710 --> 02:15:51,878
This has to be decoded
for the general.

1065
02:15:52,046 --> 02:15:55,048
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.

1066
02:15:55,257 --> 02:15:56,591
Yes, sir.

1067
02:16:04,308 --> 02:16:05,391
Run!

1068
02:16:17,071 --> 02:16:18,613
Run for it!

1069
02:16:25,913 --> 02:16:28,623
Drop the hose
and get the ladders and axes.

1070
02:16:29,625 --> 02:16:30,959
What are you waiting for?

1071
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:33,086
-We got no water.
-Why? What's wrong?

1072
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:36,047
It's the Arizona.
She cut the pipes in the mains.

1073
02:16:36,256 --> 02:16:39,217
The tanker in the ocean there
is full of aviation fuel.

1074
02:16:39,426 --> 02:16:41,427
If it goes, we'll blow up
half the harbor.

1075
02:16:41,762 --> 02:16:43,054
Come on, hurry up!

1076
02:17:02,491 --> 02:17:03,741
Get out of the way!

1077
02:17:46,452 --> 02:17:47,827
Hey, look out!

1078
02:18:07,556 --> 02:18:12,351
In all my 50 years
of public service...

1079
02:18:14,021 --> 02:18:18,191
...I have never seen a document
so crowded with infamous falsehoods...

1080
02:18:18,442 --> 02:18:20,193
...and distortions...

1081
02:18:20,861 --> 02:18:23,196
...on a scale so huge...

1082
02:18:23,363 --> 02:18:26,365
...that I never imagined until today...

1083
02:18:27,242 --> 02:18:29,869
...that any government
on this planet...

1084
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:32,872
...was capable of uttering them.

1085
02:18:46,470 --> 02:18:47,887
Mr. Hull.

1086
02:18:50,057 --> 02:18:51,516
Go.

1087
02:19:56,623 --> 02:20:01,544
What's the matter? Why in hell
doesn't the next wave take off?

1088
02:20:02,296 --> 02:20:05,673
But, sir, no one has given the order.

1089
02:20:21,982 --> 02:20:23,983
We've knocked out
the American airfields...

1090
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:28,070
...sunk four battleships,
heavily damaged three more.

1091
02:20:34,328 --> 02:20:37,830
Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's
carrier has signaled!

1092
02:20:38,290 --> 02:20:41,584
"Attack group ready for takeoff. "

1093
02:20:51,511 --> 02:20:55,514
Unfortunately, the American
carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.

1094
02:20:57,684 --> 02:20:59,894
Since we don't know where they are...

1095
02:21:00,395 --> 02:21:03,898
...we can't use our limited
supply of fuel to look for them.

1096
02:21:05,609 --> 02:21:10,196
We must not forget that enemy
submarines will be searching for us.

1097
02:21:12,199 --> 02:21:14,367
We have been lucky so far.

1098
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:18,746
No take-off signal yet?

1099
02:21:19,122 --> 02:21:20,748
There is a signal now!

1100
02:21:27,047 --> 02:21:30,132
It says, "All ships head for Japan
as soon as our planes return. "

1101
02:21:39,893 --> 02:21:40,935
It can't be!

1102
02:21:44,356 --> 02:21:45,773
It must be a mistake!

1103
02:21:51,655 --> 02:21:53,739
We cannot turn back now.

1104
02:21:55,075 --> 02:21:58,953
We must destroy the American
carriers and their dry docks...

1105
02:21:59,413 --> 02:22:00,913
...no matter how long it takes!

1106
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:06,085
You're wrong. Our mission has
been completely accomplished.

1107
02:22:08,255 --> 02:22:12,925
This task force is vital to us.
It is my duty to return it intact.

1108
02:22:20,976 --> 02:22:24,103
This war is just beginning.

1109
02:22:27,607 --> 02:22:29,775
We have a long way to go.

1110
02:22:52,632 --> 02:22:54,425
Yes, all right.

1111
02:22:54,634 --> 02:22:58,804
This came from the decoding room,
a cablegram from the War Department.

1112
02:23:11,943 --> 02:23:14,320
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.

1113
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:33,172
Pardon me, admiral.

1114
02:23:33,382 --> 02:23:35,841
-From Washington.
-Thank you.

1115
02:23:43,350 --> 02:23:45,017
Gentlemen.

1116
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:54,819
"The Japanese are presenting
at 1 p. m...

1117
02:23:55,028 --> 02:23:57,488
...Eastern Standard Time today...

1118
02:23:58,198 --> 02:24:00,533
...what amounts to an ultimatum.

1119
02:24:02,869 --> 02:24:07,873
Just what significance the hour set
may have, we do not know...

1120
02:24:09,918 --> 02:24:12,878
...but be on alert accordingly. "

1121
02:24:14,381 --> 02:24:15,881
Signed...

1122
02:24:16,508 --> 02:24:20,845
...George C. Marshall,
chief of staff.

1123
02:24:29,938 --> 02:24:31,856
My God.

1124
02:24:47,330 --> 02:24:51,250
This leaves the Navy with only two
combat groups in the Central Pacific.

1125
02:24:51,543 --> 02:24:53,836
Ours and the Lexington.

1126
02:24:54,254 --> 02:24:56,255
We don't want to get caught
like they did.

1127
02:24:56,465 --> 02:24:59,842
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?

1128
02:25:00,051 --> 02:25:03,220
We can fuel and provision
and be under way before dawn.

1129
02:25:03,430 --> 02:25:06,474
Good. That's good.

1130
02:25:17,903 --> 02:25:21,155
Here is an announcement from the
Navy Department released December 7th.

1131
02:25:22,115 --> 02:25:26,243
"Before daybreak today,
the Imperial Navy successfully launched...

1132
02:25:26,745 --> 02:25:31,290
...a large-scale air raid against
the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii. "

1133
02:25:31,917 --> 02:25:34,668
We salute the Commander-in-Chief
of our Fleet...

1134
02:25:34,836 --> 02:25:37,379
...Admiral Yamamoto.

1135
02:25:54,314 --> 02:25:58,275
I had intended to deal a fatal blow
to the American fleet...

1136
02:25:58,985 --> 02:26:01,153
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...

1137
02:26:01,821 --> 02:26:05,324
...immediately after Japan's
official declaration of war.

1138
02:26:10,539 --> 02:26:14,917
But according to the American radio,
Pearl Harbor was attacked...

1139
02:26:15,669 --> 02:26:18,837
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...

1140
02:26:19,422 --> 02:26:22,049
...was delivered in Washington.

1141
02:26:26,137 --> 02:26:28,013
I can't imagine anything...

1142
02:26:29,933 --> 02:26:32,226
...that would infuriate
the Americans more.

1143
02:26:37,315 --> 02:26:39,525
I fear all we have done...

1144
02:26:40,735 --> 02:26:44,947
...is to awaken a sleeping giant
and fill him with a terrible resolve.

1145
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:44,423
"I fear all we have done is to awaken
a sleeping giant...

1146
02:27:44,633 --> 02:27:47,593
...and fill him
with a terrible resolve. "
