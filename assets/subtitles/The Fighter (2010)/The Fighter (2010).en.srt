1
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,754
Are you gonna...
You bringing Micky in?

2
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:47,693
Yeah, he's here.

3
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,771
He should come.
He should be here as well.

4
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,920
We thought that Micky is
coming to answer the questions.

5
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:54,142
No, they said it was
going to be both of us.

6
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:59,034
- Am I looking right into the camera here?
- Just look at me right now.

7
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:00,539
All right.

8
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:03,718
You're not going to look
at the camera with the interviews?

9
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,567
I started boxing when I was
twelve years old

10
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:12,185
and I lied and said I was eighteen
or whatever it was.

11
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:14,110
I had a different name and everything.

12
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:16,373
I mean, I don't have any fights,
I've done a hundred more than that

13
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,936
before I turned professional.

14
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,790
This morning you said that...

15
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:22,469
- Why are we doing this?
- One more time.

16
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:24,442
You want to go over it all?
You want to start again?

17
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:27,917
He's my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

18
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:30,140
I'm still his trainer.
I know we've got different styles,

19
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:34,297
I'm fucking squirelly as fuck.
You know, like, I'm not even there.

20
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:38,925
That's what Sugar Ray said. I was the
most tricky fighter he'd ever come across.

21
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:44,340
'78, before Sugar Ray Leonard...
I told him he couldn't get to me.

22
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:46,066
He couldn't get to me.

23
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,009
They called me "The Pride of Lowell."

24
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,809
Everybody still talks about it,
you know, especially my brother.

25
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:54,207
His whole life he wanted to do
what I did, you know?

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,555
But we're very different fighters.

27
00:01:56,561 --> 00:02:02,326
Micky's a heavy hitter.
He's thunderous, I'm telling you.

28
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,156
Thunderous left punch.

29
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,666
Micky, he takes a punishment.
I don't know why he does it.

30
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,865
I'd say "You all right?"
He likes getting on the inside.

31
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,392
I stay on the outside.

32
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:41,919
Come on!

33
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:44,653
Dicky...

34
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,528
Would you come on?

35
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:54,429
Stop.
You've got to help me finish this.

36
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:58,919
Come on!

37
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:01,129
Unpredictable as ever!

38
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:04,108
You don't have to be Columbo
to see where this fight is headed!

39
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,660
Yeah, bam!

40
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,547
All right, he punched Micky Ward down!

41
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:13,717
HBO's making a movie on me and
my comeback and my brother

42
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,378
is going to beat Saoul Mamby
in Atlanta next week!

43
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,231
The Pride of Lowell is back!

44
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:24,432
Quacker!

45
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,034
Who wants some?
Who wants some?

46
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:32,370
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

47
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:51,321
I want a cut.

48
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,494
Doing good?

49
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,561
You guys having a good day?

50
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,365
How are you?

51
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:05,119
Come on. Come on. What you got?
What you got going on?

52
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:08,241
Lou! Hey, Lou DiBella!

53
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:11,075
How are you guys, huh?

54
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,182
I'm making my comeback.

55
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:20,421
Hey, Marty, Marty.
Come out here, huh?

56
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:38,302
Hey!

57
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,537
HBO is making a movie on me!

58
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,245
Hey, beautiful.

59
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:51,354
You got that?

60
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:54,857
Can't remember who she is.
I can't remember shit!

61
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,495
Hey!
Hey, Garcia!

62
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,389
How are you, nice?

63
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,468
How'd you get here?
Drive around?

64
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:06,564
Hey, Ray. Hey.
I love you, Ray.

65
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,804
This is what it's all about.

66
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,456
He make mistake?

67
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,659
No, he'll be here.
Like I said,

68
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,289
sometimes he goes on his own schedule,
but when he gets here we work hard.

69
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,227
Nobody pushes me harder than him.

70
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,934
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

71
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,766
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters?

72
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,985
They'll talk your ear off.
You gotta pay them to shut up.

73
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:51,483
He can tell you how
Dicky was helping him.

74
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,167
Come on, Micky.

75
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,145
Okay.

76
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:58,450
Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

77
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,282
You know where he is.

78
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,435
What's that dumb cop doing in there?

79
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,243
Where's Dicky?
Girls?

80
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:23,032
- I don't know.
- You see him this morning?

81
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,098
Your brother?
Not this morning.

82
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:27,347
Look at Mom!
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

83
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:30,012
You are smoking hot!

84
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,143
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
My Dicky should be doing that.

85
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,059
Dicky ain't here, Alice.

86
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:39,194
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

87
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,014
- Forget about him. Never mind about him.
- He's not doing what he's supposed to do with him.

88
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:43,908
- Start saying to Micky...
- He's not part of this, all right?

89
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,315
- Alice, he's not being handled right.
- Did you get me coming in all right?

90
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,640
You want me to do it again?
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

91
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:51,017
- Dicky's the trainer.
- I'm doing him favor, Alice.

92
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:53,121
I will show you over here

93
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:56,479
these scrapbooks I have been
collecting for years.

94
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,301
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

95
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,380
Taught you everything, didn't he, honey?

96
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:05,779
In '78 we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

97
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:08,464
Oh, my God. Have you seen that video?
Well, you're from HBO,

98
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:11,727
you've got to see it again!
Come on. Where's the video at?

99
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,652
<i>Tonight my son is going to surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

100
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,697
<i>Believe me. I know it.</i>

101
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,821
<i>Sugar Ray might have some trouble tonight.</i>

102
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,354
<i>That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,</i>

103
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,350
<i>a young man who can punch,</i>

104
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,280
<i>and I would like to say at this time
that physically they're just about equal.</i>

105
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:59,276
<i>Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockout.</i>

106
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:03,141
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

107
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:09,584
<i>Eklund just walked over there.
Nobody seems to know what's happening.</i>

108
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,058
Dicky did it.

109
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,695
Dicky did it.

110
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:21,917
Dicky did it!

111
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:24,171
Aren't you supposed to be
training Micky right now?

112
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,716
No, it ain't until 9:00.

113
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:28,204
Dicky, it's fucking 11:45.

114
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:31,166
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?

115
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,396
Where'd you fucking
park the car, Boo Boo?

116
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,551
- I didn't park it. You did.
- Huh?

117
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:38,273
Check your fucking pockets for the keys.
You've got the keys, huh?

118
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,015
I didn't park it, man.

119
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,449
- Not here. I don't know...
- Check your pockets, all right?

120
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:46,780
Oh, fuck it, I'll run.
I need the fucking road work.

121
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:49,939
Road work?
Are you crazy?

122
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,492
He's a great runner.

123
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:18,210
Hey.

124
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,412
Hey!

125
00:09:22,314 --> 00:09:24,475
- I'm here!
- Hey, Dicky.

126
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,464
Better late than never.

127
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,603
Here, look.

128
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,500
Detectives on the scene...

129
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:35,801
Get to the bar with this...

130
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,765
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Why don't you...

131
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,788
Hold it. Hold it.
Let me get this straight.

132
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:45,049
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

133
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:47,517
Yeah.
Yeah, they're both in my corner.

134
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:49,523
- This is what goes on.
- Okay. It must be...

135
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:51,635
Don't you have a job to
go to or something?

136
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,347
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

137
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,961
Yeah, Sergeant O'Keefe's
working overtime here.

138
00:09:56,969 --> 00:10:01,455
So we go at this old man:
Jewish, black, former world champion.

139
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,251
I think we've got
all the bases covered.

140
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:07,642
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

141
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,697
He can't get used to losing.
It's a mental thing.

142
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,245
But we're gonna break that
with Mamby, right?

143
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:13,843
Yeah, I hope.
When we can train.

144
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,509
When we train. Right.
Don't be wasting time, Mick, you know?

145
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,181
- Wasting time?
- Half the fucking day's gone.

146
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:21,814
Yeah, half the day's gone.
I've been waiting for you.

147
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,050
Come on, move.
We're going to outbox Mamby, huh?

148
00:10:57,712 --> 00:11:01,305
- Take it out on the head.
- Head, body, head. That's your combo.

149
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,913
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

150
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:06,353
You know,
Sugar Ray's going to be there

151
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,661
calling the fight for ESPN.

152
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:12,569
I ain't seen him since
I knocked him down,

153
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:15,629
like, fourteen years ago
or something, right?

154
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:19,483
Let's get a real sparring going on here.

155
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,444
Don't want to embarrass yourself.

156
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,174
Don't want to embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, huh?

157
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,449
Come on, head, body, head.

158
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:30,941
Your punch, man!

159
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:35,755
That's your punch. Now that's your little punch.
Use your whole fucking body now.

160
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:39,921
George's fingers are so fucking big
he can't even dial the phone!

161
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,812
That's not helping, George!

162
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,581
- Wait, I'm confused.
- What?

163
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,518
- I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

164
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,879
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

165
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:57,207
Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's,
Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis' father.

166
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:58,916
- Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

167
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,274
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so are Cindy and Cathy.

168
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,270
George is really...

169
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,452
- And Micky...
- No.

170
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,305
Micky and I are Wards.

171
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:13,281
It's always sounded like Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

172
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,629
- And then there was George.
- Just George.

173
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,083
- George is my man.
- George is our papa.

174
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:20,797
After Dick, it was just George.

175
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,009
Come on.
Come over here...

176
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:54,677
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

177
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,435
I told her all about you.

178
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,040
I don't want to ask her.
She's going to say no.

179
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,475
Can't beat that ass, can you?

180
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,378
Get at it. Go.
Come on.

181
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:17,229
Are you just going to stand there
and stare at my ass?

182
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,259
Your father stares at my ass
but he talks to me.

183
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,898
He thinks you're the greatest.

184
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,669
- He didn't tell me you were new.
- Keep the change, doll.

185
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,371
He told me you came for you sister.

186
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,166
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip!

187
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:31,099
You know what the bell says
about this one?

188
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,807
Cheap bastard.
Cheap fucker.

189
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,580
Comes in every day,
gives me shitty tips.

190
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,279
Yeah, fuck you, too.

191
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:41,905
You pave streets, right?

192
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:43,725
Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.

193
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,803
Oh, yeah. I heard you're a stepping stone.

194
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:48,222
- I'm no stepping stone.
- Mm.

195
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:50,410
You're the guy they use

196
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,710
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

197
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,956
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

198
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,390
The next fight's going to show who I am.

199
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:00,648
Yeah, and he's going to
lose that one, too.

200
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:03,478
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

201
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,979
Now move that sugar ass...

202
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:10,256
Okay, be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

203
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:13,150
Hey, don't hurt your hand.
You've got a fight next week.

204
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:15,087
Besides,
you wipe your ass with that one.

205
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,907
Don't wait up, or I'm going to hit
you in the car, sucker, all right?

206
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,232
He's gonna be so lame.

207
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,296
All right?
All right?

208
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:25,825
That's right.

209
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,784
Take your drink.
He's taking his drink.

210
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,167
This guy's going to be champion.
He's a great guy. He's a great fighter.

211
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,726
Okay? Hold on.
Thanks for the drink.

212
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,074
You know those cameras
are making a movie about him?

213
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,933
He knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard

214
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:41,293
on HBO. That's why they're following
him around with the cameras.

215
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:43,219
They're making a movie
about his comeback.

216
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:46,202
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fighting?

217
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,820
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

218
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:51,206
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

219
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:54,012
Where did they find a guy like that?

220
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,174
He's no joke.
Former world champion.

221
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,051
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:00,583
- I match up good with him, though.
- Yeah?

223
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,658
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

224
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:04,730
Well, I got a light end, you know?

225
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:06,890
I've got a reputation for brawling,
but I'm not going to brawl with him.

226
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:09,603
- I'm going to try to box him.
- There's a difference?

227
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:12,596
Yeah, in brawling you slug it out.
I hit you. You hit me.

228
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,263
Boxing is a chess game, you know?

229
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:16,140
Got to pick my punches
to take him down.

230
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:18,209
I'm going head, body, head, body...

231
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,294
What is head, body, head, body?

232
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:25,169
Well, I hit him in the head, then his
hands got to go up to protect himself.

233
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:29,694
Opens up his body, then I hit him in the body,
hand goes back down. I go back up to the head,

234
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:31,796
hand goes back, and I hit him in the body.

235
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,720
People who don't know fighting think
you do a lot of damage hitting the head,

236
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,139
but you actually do more hitting the body.

237
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:40,099
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

238
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,068
Are you married?

239
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,002
No, would I ask you out if I was married?
What kind of guy do you think I am?

240
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,612
Happens all the time, trust me.

241
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,005
I'm not like that.

242
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,416
I'm not married. I've got a daughter,
I see her every other weekend.

243
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,224
Her name is Kasie.
But that's it.

244
00:15:57,178 --> 00:15:58,922
Come on, let me take you out.

245
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,350
When?

246
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:04,693
Saturday night I'll be
back in Atlantic City.

247
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,511
Is this the real number?

248
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,380
You'll have to call it and see.

249
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,714
I will.

250
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:28,593
Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

251
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,302
- Hey. What's up?
- Dicky, hey. How's it going?

252
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,371
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

253
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,906
What's he doing here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

254
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,929
I just want to say hi to Kasie.

255
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:03,611
It's not your day, goodbye.

256
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,560
Yeah, but I'm not around next week.

257
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:07,298
Now you're ditching
the days you do have?

258
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:09,130
No, I have a fight.
I told you that.

259
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,717
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

260
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:17,930
I can't talk to her, okay?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

261
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,350
I want to talk to my daughter now.

262
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,828
- Talk to your father.
- God damn it, Jimmy.

263
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:24,940
Hi, Daddy.
Daddy's gonna beat Saoul Mamby.

264
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:28,897
That's right. And I'm gonna tell you that
after I win, I'm gonna start making big money.

265
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:31,175
And I'll move into a bigger apartment,
like we talked about,

266
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,559
- so you can live with me more days, okay?
- Yeah, a bigger apartment!

267
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,060
- Wish me luck, all right?
- Don't hold your breath, Kasie.

268
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,343
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

269
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,807
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Thanks, Kasie. I love you, honey.

270
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,087
Bye, baby.

271
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:48,993
- Where is he?
- Jesus Christ. Fucking holding us up.

272
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,163
- Quit your worrying, for crying out loud.
- All that shit in my face...

273
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:03,745
I know it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

274
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,861
and they have a saying:
"Let go and let God."

275
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,265
- You've got to let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

276
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:12,130
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

277
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:15,314
- You're already doing it without him.
- No I'm not.

278
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:17,083
- Yes you are.
- Look, you know where he is.

279
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:19,496
Why don't you just go get him?

280
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,952
Can you get him?

281
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:22,607
I'm not fucking going to get him.

282
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:25,761
Well are we all going to go over there
in the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

283
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,408
Dicky.

284
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:41,790
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

285
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:45,416
Uh-oh, Dicky, your mother's outside.
She's down there.

286
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,227
I'm not here.

287
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:59,189
Don't, Dicky.
Dicky!

288
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,469
What the fuck are you doing?
You know we've got to go to the airport now.

289
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,179
We've got a flight to catch.

290
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:10,402
You know how important this fight is to me.

291
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:14,053
- Don't tell Mom I'm here, all right?
- She knows.

292
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:16,821
- Pick me up back at the house, all right?
- Are you fucking...

293
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,382
She's in the driveway right now.

294
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,396
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fucking driveway.

295
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:24,827
- We've got a flight to catch.
- You do this on the day your brother's traveling?

296
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:28,647
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to see what I have.

297
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,791
- The fuck did you hit him for?
- Why'd you make me do that to you?

298
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:31,953
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky...

299
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:33,738
I was on my way, Mom.

300
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,655
- What are you doing?
- No, Mom. Mom...

301
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:40,306
Why can't we just go to the
fucking airport for once, please?

302
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,876
Hey, Alice, what about your husband who's
laying on the fucking ground over here?

303
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,449
You want to help your husband?

304
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:48,289
What are you doing, running in here
like a silverback fucking gorilla?

305
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,917
- We had to get him, didn't we?
- Oh, yeah, you got him, pal.

306
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,108
You see Mamby?

307
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:15,630
See how Mamby's arm comes up?
Leaves his side open,

308
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,959
you just play him up like a pinball machine.

309
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,246
He'll be pissing blood.
No way you'll lose, Mick. No way.

310
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,591
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky, boy.

311
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:24,446
Hey listen, boy.

312
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,219
ESPN can't get us better rooms than this?

313
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:28,951
I wouldn't worry about the rooms right now,
Dicky. You've got bigger headaches.

314
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,455
Like what?

315
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:33,132
The doctor won't let Mamby fight.

316
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:34,417
Why not?

317
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,777
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

318
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,712
Yeah.

319
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,285
Dicky, we can still have a fight.

320
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:42,190
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

321
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,681
Mike Mungin, who's that?

322
00:20:43,703 --> 00:20:47,142
- Guy from Philly. Been in prison.
- He's been out a few months.

323
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:50,830
I've called everybody, checked everywhere.
He's the only guy I could find.

324
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:53,672
My last three fights were rough, Lou.
I mean this one's supposed to be easier.

325
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,664
We've been fucking preparing for Mamby.

326
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:59,104
Right, but this guy just came off the couch.
He's been sitting on his ass.

327
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:01,816
Could be an easy win for Mick.

328
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,710
Joey Farrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

329
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:08,535
- And you knocked down Joey Farrell...
- Exactly, and Mungin just got off the couch.

330
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,485
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

331
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,657
How over?

332
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:15,028
- 162, 165...
- 165?

333
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:18,092
Micky dropped weight.
He's 146.

334
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:21,737
Lou, we prepared for Mamby, all right?
We prepared for Mamby!

335
00:21:21,754 --> 00:21:24,889
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

336
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:28,182
Road work, everything else.
This other guy hasn't done dick.

337
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:31,418
Don't forget.
You don't fight, nobody gets paid.

338
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,580
Lou, please...

339
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,721
All right. Um,
Joey Farrell knocked him out...

340
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,494
Going to be a hell of a fight, huh?

341
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:50,778
I'm not doing this.
165 is big.

342
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,738
- You knocked down Joey Farrell.
- So what? He's a middleweight.

343
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,583
He just got off the couch.

344
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,013
He's got twenty pounds on me, Dicky.

345
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:00,936
Joey Farrell knocked him out.
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

346
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,091
- You just said that.
- Yeah but... You can't be scared.

347
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,089
- Scared?
- Yeah.

348
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:07,061
- Why don't you go fucking fight him?
- I'll go fucking fight him. He's fat.

349
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:10,678
Go snap out the teeth. It's your big comeback,
right? That's what Alice wants.

350
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:13,372
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

351
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:16,657
All right, I knocked down Joey Farrell, okay?
But the guy is a middleweight.

352
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,729
I'm a welterweight. What, they don't have
a fucking heavyweight to tow in there with me?

353
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,406
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

354
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,967
Yeah, Alice. No problem.

355
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:27,581
You watch from the outside now.

356
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:32,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

357
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:36,184
Holy shit!

358
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:39,296
Hey, look.
There's Sugar Ray Leonard.

359
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,053
Hey, Ray. Sugar Ray.
Over here.

360
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:46,052
Dicky, come on.
Look at the size of that guy.

361
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:49,277
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

362
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:51,929
That guy's no welterweight.

363
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,784
All right, Mick. Gonna have to learn
to fuss you around. It's time now.

364
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,301
He did not just get off the fucking couch.
If he did, I want to buy a couch like that.

365
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:01,553
I don't care who that guy is.
I don't care. Look at me.

366
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:05,162
You're Micky Ward.
You're Micky Ward.

367
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:11,534
Micky Ward fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia,

368
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:14,246
a much bigger man.

369
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:17,730
Punches smashing Ward.

370
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,002
Ward goes down!
Ward goes down!

371
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,539
Micky, what the fuck is wrong?
Get rid of this dude!

372
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,041
Mungin didn't even know
he'd be fighting today...

373
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,977
Come on, now, Mick!

374
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,183
Ward, a respected fighter. You hope
this mismatch doesn't hurt his confidence.

375
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,531
- You're a loser!
- Loser!

376
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:53,422
You're a loser!

377
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:26,018
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

378
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,196
Hey, Dicky!

379
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,656
- How are you doing, man?
- How are you?

380
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,049
165 pounds. ESPN screwed us.

381
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:40,149
- The guy was huge.
- You know what I'm saying?

382
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,741
You know, I knocked Ray down.

383
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,242
I look like shit, but I knocked Ray down.

384
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,626
Let me buy you guys a drink,
all right? You want a cold one?

385
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:49,043
- No, no, no...
- A cold one!

386
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:51,950
I've got to leave.
I've got a plane to catch. Next time.

387
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,906
Hey, Ray. HBO is making
a movie on me, you know?

388
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:57,811
Can they call you?

389
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:59,843
I'm going to get a fight.

390
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:02,707
I'd like you to be there, for old times' sake.
You can commentate or something.

391
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,567
What's the movie about?

392
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,619
My comeback, right?

393
00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:09,633
- Call me.
- I'll call you.

394
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:12,178
Don't be a stranger.

395
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,517
He's my old pal.

396
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:20,156
- You going to the hospital?
- What is that?

397
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:23,968
Look, Mick. Nobody's got heart like you.

398
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:26,787
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

399
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:28,546
It's killing your chances.

400
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,730
- What's he talking to Mike Toma about?
- I don't know what that is.

401
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:32,584
I want to give you a real shot.

402
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,989
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

403
00:25:36,008 --> 00:25:37,863
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

404
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:40,862
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

405
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:42,650
What about my brother?

406
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:45,268
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

407
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:48,357
You owe it to yourself to come to Vegas.

408
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:51,105
Come on, Mick. What has Dicky done for you?

409
00:25:51,128 --> 00:25:54,075
He gets you into fights.
He lets you get beat like you did tonight.

410
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:57,962
You know you never should have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds. Think of it that way.

411
00:25:57,969 --> 00:25:59,612
You should have given it up.

412
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:04,027
Get out of the car there. Come on, you!

413
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,790
- Sit the hell down.
- Just a little more scotch for Mom, okay?

414
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:11,033
Here you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back, old broad.

415
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:16,062
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray...
He's a beautiful man, isn't he? Right?

416
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:17,634
A beautiful man.

417
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:19,630
You should have seen the way
he was looking at her.

418
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,409
- He's a pretty man, huh?
- He's a good guy. I like him. I know.

419
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:26,774
I seen him ringside, and he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

420
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:30,068
You know he's all about family, that guy.
Likes to see a family stick together.

421
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:33,779
Mick, what'd Mike Toma want
with you last night, huh?

422
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,312
He wants to train me in Vegas.

423
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,771
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

424
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:40,180
You don't know him.

425
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:43,426
He say anything about me?
He say I could come?

426
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:45,234
He didn't mention you.

427
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:50,096
What are you going to do in Vegas
without your brother, huh?

428
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:52,348
That guy just wants to use you,
like a piece of toilet paper.

429
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:55,494
What are you going to do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

430
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,798
- I know. That's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

431
00:26:57,822 --> 00:27:00,546
Yeah, I told him. I said
I need to be with my family.

432
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,180
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

433
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,986
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're going to call him, baby.

434
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,476
You guys can spar a little, right?

435
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:15,232
There's my champ.
Daddy's home. Daddy's home!

436
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:18,227
I love you...

437
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,784
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

438
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,999
Because it's killing me.

439
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,625
- Come on...
- Uncle Micky win the fight?

440
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,208
No, Uncle Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

441
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:34,141
Hey, Mick. Take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

442
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,560
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

443
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:39,164
I don't know, Mom.
I don't think I want to do this no more.

444
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:42,125
- What don't you want to do no more?
- I just don't want to do it anymore.

445
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:44,991
- What are you talking...
- Hey, Mick.

446
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:47,867
ESPN screwed us. They owe us.

447
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:51,081
We'll get another fight.
You heal up.

448
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,476
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

449
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,769
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

450
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:58,912
Hey, maybe they'll even do Dicky's
comeback fight. What do you think, huh?

451
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,928
Oh, come on. Cheer up.
You take a little soap when you get home.

452
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:05,159
Have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight, sweetheart.

453
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:06,967
Much better fight.
I'm going to talk to them.

454
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:09,546
- For Christ's sake, Alice.
- What?

455
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:12,603
- He's been through the ringer. Leave him alone.
- What are you talking about?

456
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:15,658
- Leave him some time to himself.
- What is your fucking problem?

457
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:18,540
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not going to come in?

458
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:22,418
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

459
00:28:22,442 --> 00:28:23,999
Come on. Let's go inside.

460
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:26,332
He's going to go rest.
He's all grumpy.

461
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:29,385
He's tired. He's beat up.
He's a little embarrassed, I think.

462
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:30,021
Who is it?

463
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:53,549
I saw the shade move.

464
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:57,003
Micky, the shade is still moving.
I saw you come to the window.

465
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:58,589
I know you're in there.

466
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:01,302
The least you can do
is open up this door

467
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:03,861
and tell me to my face
why you didn't call me yesterday.

468
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:11,511
Why did you stand me up last night?

469
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:16,319
I started to call.
I was going to call. I just couldn't.

470
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,908
Because you lost the fight?

471
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,735
Maybe, yeah.
Because I lost the fight.

472
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,658
How do you know my house anyway?

473
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:25,503
I asked my brother.

474
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:29,448
Your thing's coming off.
And your other thing.

475
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,257
You got any tape?

476
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,820
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

477
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,003
I didn't get to fight the black Jewish guy.

478
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,476
You didn't get to go head, body, head?

479
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:53,863
Saoul Mamby got the flu.

480
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:57,069
Guy that took his place had twenty pounds
on me. I never should have fought him.

481
00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:00,422
Why did you?

482
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,790
Nobody would have got paid.

483
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:06,300
Everybody said I could beat him.

484
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:08,765
Who's everybody?

485
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:10,428
My mother and my brother.

486
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:17,271
So are you going to take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

487
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,577
- Hey.
- Hey.

488
00:31:49,855 --> 00:31:51,862
- You look great.
- Thank you.

489
00:31:51,874 --> 00:31:53,732
You've got a nice house, too.

490
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:55,176
It's an apartment building.

491
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,827
There's five of them in there.
One of my old roommates lives with me.

492
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,506
Roommate?
What, were you in the army?

493
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:01,712
- College.
- College? Wow.

494
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:04,483
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

495
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,148
You seem to enjoy it.
Very popular down there.

496
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:10,053
Ugh, yeah. Popular.
I've got to get out of there.

497
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:12,917
If I don't drink while I'm working
I'll fucking kill myself.

498
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,040
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

499
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,320
- A full boat's a scholarship, right?
- Yeah.

500
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:19,787
For what?

501
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:23,259
- I was a high-jumper.
- High-jumper? You've got to be kidding me.

502
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:26,655
Fuck you. I was good.
I was New England champ. I cleared 5'8".

503
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,567
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

504
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,929
You?

505
00:32:46,513 --> 00:32:48,404
What are we doing in richie-rich Lexington?

506
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:49,965
You come to this theater a lot?

507
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:52,024
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They've got good movies here.

508
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,101
- Yeah? Like what?
- <i>Belly Epi-cue</i>.

509
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,175
I think it's <i>Bell Epic</i>.

510
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,918
It's epic. <i>Bell Epic</i>.

511
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,336
<i>Belle Epoque</i>.
<i>The New York Times</i> don't lie.

512
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,278
Well I never heard of it.

513
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,484
Where'd you hear about it?
<i>The New York Times</i>?

514
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:08,480
No, a guy from work.

515
00:33:08,492 --> 00:33:10,829
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

516
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:11,874
Oh. Cool.

517
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:42,588
That's the movie you wanted to see?

518
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:44,820
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

519
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:48,029
Had to read the whole fucking movie.
Fucking subtitled.

520
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,096
Some guy from a road crew recommended it
to you? A fucking subtitled movie?

521
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:56,767
What's going on, huh?

522
00:33:56,781 --> 00:34:00,216
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

523
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:01,833
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

524
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:05,643
I like you.

525
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,908
I came here because
I don't want to show my face in Lowell.

526
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:11,350
I told everybody I was going to win
that fight and get back on track.

527
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:14,079
I told my daughter I was going to get
a bigger apartment so she could move in.

528
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:16,052
You don't think I wanted to call you?

529
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:18,318
I was embarrassed.

530
00:34:18,337 --> 00:34:20,716
I'm sick of being a fucking disappointment.

531
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:28,823
You really think your family
is looking out for you?

532
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,467
Don't say that. I don't like that.

533
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,261
What else I can say
after what you told me?

534
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:40,006
Look at your face.

535
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:43,105
Look at you.

536
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,738
Bullshit, Lou.

537
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:13,366
I'm not going to stop calling until you
make this right and get us a fight that's fair.

538
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:15,939
My boy could have got killed last time.

539
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:20,034
Yeah, like what?

540
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:23,834
Just don't tell me he just got
off the fucking couch.

541
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:26,307
Mm-hm.

542
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,220
Coming off a loss?

543
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:34,265
That sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

544
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:37,271
Got a great opportunity here.

545
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:38,887
We've got to go find Micky.

546
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:40,893
Nobody's seen him for, like, three weeks.

547
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,164
Jesus...

548
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:47,701
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find.
Now it's both of them?

549
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:49,921
Mom, I think he's with that girl from the bar.

550
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:53,097
- What girl?
- It's that fucking girl, Charlene.

551
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,375
That's who he's with. That girl from the bar.

552
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:59,091
George was all fucking eager
for them to get together.

553
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,651
- I heard she's into three-ways.
- Yeah, with other girls.

554
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:03,697
Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

555
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,963
MTV girls? What are you talking about?

556
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:07,073
Wild.

557
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:10,008
She acts all fucking superior
because she went to college.

558
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:14,152
You girls just go find your brother Micky.

559
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:17,593
Tell him I've got important business to discuss.

560
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:19,539
I've got to go find Dicky.

561
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:30,547
Dicky!

562
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:22,044
Hey, Mom. It's not...
It's just...

563
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:25,268
It's just a friend's house.

564
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:28,678
Come on, whatever.

565
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:46,734
? I started a joke, ?

566
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:51,846
? which started the whole world crying. ?

567
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:56,085
? Oh, if only I'd seen ?

568
00:37:56,097 --> 00:38:00,120
? that the joke was on me. ?

569
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:04,018
? I started to cry, ?

570
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:09,249
? which started the whole world laughing. ?

571
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:13,171
? Oh, if only I'd seen ?

572
00:38:13,183 --> 00:38:16,648
? that the joke was on me. ?

573
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:20,663
? I looked at the skies, ?

574
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:26,467
? running my hands over my eyes, ?

575
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:32,151
? and I fell out of bed, ?

576
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:34,946
? hurting my head... ?

577
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:54,460
So you're Beaver,
and you're Red Bear.

578
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:56,010
Red beard.

579
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,569
She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

580
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:01,128
You're Red Dog.
You're Beaver.

581
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:03,781
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

582
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:05,237
Be nice.

583
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:07,797
Don't use the nicknames.

584
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:11,270
What the fuck will I call them then?

585
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:13,710
Speaking of family...

586
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:27,726
Hello.

587
00:39:29,238 --> 00:39:31,567
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

588
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:35,895
I've heard a lot about you.

589
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:37,631
Really? I've heard a lot about you, too.

590
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:39,693
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

591
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,671
Can we just sit down and talk about business?

592
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:46,878
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

593
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:51,302
- Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.
- Just like I told you.

594
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:55,553
Joe Mellenk. Six weeks. Foxwoods.

595
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:59,312
Ten in eight. He's nothing.

596
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:02,188
- And they're going to pay us twenty grand.
- $17,500, technically.

597
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:06,596
$17,500, which is still good money, Mick.

598
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,501
Yeah.

599
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:14,504
That's good, Dick. I'm just trying to
figure out what's best for me.

600
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:20,206
Like what, huh?

601
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:27,038
What's best for you, sweetheart?

602
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:29,869
Come on, Mick. I thought you'd be more excited.
Why aren't you more excited?

603
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:33,791
It's a good fight, good money.
I got something with Lou Gold.

604
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:35,601
He knows us.

605
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,969
I know, Mom. I just don't want things
going the way they've been going.

606
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:44,018
Mick, that last fight was unfair.
It was unfair.

607
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:46,908
- And we ain't going to repeat that, right?
- Oh, not on your life.

608
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:51,166
You know, buddy,
it's just you in the ring.

609
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:52,763
Yeah, I know it's just me in the ring.

610
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:54,924
But I don't like the way
things have been going here.

611
00:40:54,946 --> 00:40:56,020
- Where?
- Where?

612
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:59,026
Here, this, us, Lowell, the whole routine.

613
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,866
- George, stay out of it!
- You're doing all the talking.

614
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:04,861
- Let him talk. Listen.
- I'm asking him.

615
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,931
- You're telling him. Listen.
- Stay out of it.

616
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:10,127
Hey, don't tell me to stay out of it.

617
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,358
Mick, what's the problem?

618
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:16,153
- Problems.
- What problems?

619
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:18,688
- Problems...
- Like what?

620
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:23,775
Like maybe you
not showing up on time to train.

621
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:27,105
Like maybe him having to
come find you in a crack house

622
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:30,282
when you're supposed to be at the airport.

623
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:36,482
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.
Why are you talking?

624
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,594
I'm Charlene. We just met.

625
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:42,984
We're together. Do we need to do this again?
Hi, I'm Charlene.

626
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:45,828
- Hi, Charlene.
- Hi.

627
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:47,696
- Hi, I'm Charlene.
- Hi, Charlene.

628
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,293
Hey, we're together.

629
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,211
What are you going to do, Mick?

630
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:54,771
Listen to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

631
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:56,759
What does she know about boxing?

632
00:41:56,778 --> 00:42:02,002
I know they're going to Vegas
and getting paid to train year-round.

633
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:04,769
Sounds a hell of a lot better than
what you've got him doing here.

634
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:10,526
You going to let her talk like that
to your mother?

635
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:11,895
Come on, Micky.

636
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:14,957
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

637
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:20,526
I have done everything.
Everything I could for you, Micky.

638
00:42:21,858 --> 00:42:23,795
This MTV girl comes along...

639
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:26,880
Stop calling me an MTV girl,
whatever the fuck that means.

640
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:28,767
- Skank.
- Wild.

641
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:35,067
I've been doing this over fifteen years.
She comes in, disrespects me...

642
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:38,100
She don't mean no disrespect, okay?

643
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:41,168
I had a chance to get paid to train year-round.

644
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,816
Year-round, okay?
That's all she's talking about.

645
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,894
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

646
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:48,641
I know what you're talking about, all right?
I could have had that.

647
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:55,227
You know, I had opportunities
like maybe you're going to have.

648
00:42:55,736 --> 00:43:00,941
Now, you want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

649
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,636
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

650
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:04,806
- You?
- Yeah, I'll do it.

651
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:05,662
- Trust me.
- How?

652
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,180
Hey, trust me, all right?

653
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,382
Done.

654
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:14,644
All right? Charlene?
Yeah? Everyone?

655
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:23,491
So you put in $200...

656
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:25,558
Then you get ten other people
to put in $200...

657
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:30,671
And you've got your $2000.

658
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:39,192
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody. Just ten of you.

659
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:40,507
Ten lucky ones.

660
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:46,217
- You'll rip us off.
- No, no.

661
00:43:46,235 --> 00:43:48,865
- Give me another $200.
- You give me $200!

662
00:43:49,898 --> 00:43:53,631
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

663
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,109
Right? You understand? No?

664
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:04,566
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

665
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:06,374
I love Cambodian people!

666
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:09,759
I mean, look. Look at Karen.

667
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:12,137
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

668
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,565
And Brian. We work on a road crew together.

669
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:16,769
Not so much lately.

670
00:44:16,783 --> 00:44:18,884
Brian, we work on a road crew together.

671
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:21,444
You haven't been showing up,
that's what I'm saying.

672
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,077
This isn't any kind of Cambodian thing.

673
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,333
White people do this to other white people.

674
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:28,693
- It's what makes the world go around.
- I don't think that's helping.

675
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:32,602
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

676
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:42,314
I mean, they didn't understand.
They're practically on my game...

677
00:44:42,325 --> 00:44:45,754
Usually they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

678
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:49,494
the opportunity. I mean, it was awesome.
What were we talking about?

679
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:51,593
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.
- Right, right, right.

680
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:56,560
Sugar Ray was too much, too soon.
I needed to build up slow.

681
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:02,540
- What's this movie about again?
- I told you, it's about crack addiction.

682
00:45:02,563 --> 00:45:05,405
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

683
00:45:08,785 --> 00:45:10,652
Fuck.

684
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:15,055
We've got to get Mick's money.

685
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:29,599
Yeah!
That was awesome!

686
00:46:14,854 --> 00:46:17,896
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

687
00:46:19,728 --> 00:46:23,097
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof, that's it!

688
00:46:23,098 --> 00:46:24,789
- Empty your pockets.
- Are you a cop?

689
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:28,041
Get on the fucking sidewalk, move!
Fucking move! Don't turn around!

690
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:31,346
Don't turn around!
We'll have to take your vehicle.

691
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:33,717
- How am I going to get home?
- That's your problem.

692
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:37,371
How much we got here? Count it.

693
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,865
What the fuck?

694
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,496
That's the guy!
He did it to me and he's doing it again!

695
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:47,602
Get on the ground right now!

696
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:27,668
Open the door!
I've got to get off the fucking street!

697
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:31,771
I'm trying to get off the fucking street!

698
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:55,298
It's Dicky. The cops are fucking punching him.
They're beating him. He needs help.

699
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,906
Stay here. Don't get up. Stay here.

700
00:47:59,914 --> 00:48:02,756
Listen to him. Stay right here.

701
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:05,475
Are you fucking kidding me?

702
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:14,284
Hey what the fuck?
Come on.

703
00:48:14,301 --> 00:48:16,452
Just put him in the car.
You don't need to do that.

704
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,687
Want to get involved?
Now you're involved.

705
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:28,041
He's a fighter.
Break his fucking hands

706
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:47,012
Micky your hand...
Your hand...

707
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:53,651
Separate cars, separate cells.

708
00:48:53,658 --> 00:48:56,098
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

709
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:58,776
Come on, folks, time to go home.
Let's go.

710
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:03,051
- Hey, Dicky!
- What the fuck, man?

711
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:05,493
- Dicky!
- Jesus Christ.

712
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,610
His hands...

713
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,908
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

714
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:54,152
Ward: One count of disturbing the peace,
released on your own recognizance.

715
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:58,057
Eklund: Three counts of assault
and battery on a police officer,

716
00:49:58,077 --> 00:50:01,998
two counts of resisting arrest,
two counts of larceny from a person,

717
00:50:02,022 --> 00:50:04,429
two counts of impersonating
a police officer.

718
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:07,558
Bail set at $25,000.

719
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:10,338
Case continued two weeks from today.

720
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:16,127
I'm wondering about the File 357.

721
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,215
I need a copy of the discovery report,
as well.

722
00:50:23,392 --> 00:50:26,326
- You're going to say it was self-defense, right?
- What?

723
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:28,489
You're going to say it was self-defense, right?

724
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:30,793
You came outside, you seen them beating on me.
I didn't do nothing.

725
00:50:30,805 --> 00:50:33,727
I was just waiting outside like anybody else.
Mick, I was doing it for you.

726
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:35,243
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

727
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:38,273
Do me a favor. Don't do fucking
nothing for me no more, okay?

728
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:41,984
- I'm fucking done lying for you.
- What are you going to do without me, huh?

729
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:45,436
Huh?
This ain't how it was going to go down.

730
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:48,683
They should have just put me in the car, huh?

731
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:51,431
Mick, come on! Mick!

732
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:07,067
Dicky, hey! What's up, Dicky?

733
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,376
Hey, that's the man!

734
00:51:11,388 --> 00:51:13,472
- Hey!
- Hey!

735
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,935
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

736
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:19,870
Dicky! Dicky! Dicky!

737
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,314
Who is it?

738
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:12,480
I don't want to see you, Micky.

739
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:13,901
Charlene...

740
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:15,848
I can't take it.

741
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,748
I'm not going to let you
or your family drag me down.

742
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:20,764
I'm quitting, Charlene, okay?

743
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:23,675
I'm done fighting.
I don't need it anymore.

744
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,191
- That's fucking stupid.
- What? Why?

745
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,836
Because it's sad that you let them take it
away from you with their stupid bullshit.

746
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:35,654
What else I can do, Charlene?

747
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,394
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

748
00:52:38,418 --> 00:52:42,522
There's this guy that your dad wants you to meet,
you just don't think you can do it without Dicky.

749
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,518
Charlene...

750
00:52:45,692 --> 00:52:48,041
- Don't call.
- Come on.

751
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,225
Don't call me, okay?

752
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:02,336
Hey, Dicky, you hurt bad?

753
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:06,528
Poor fucker.

754
00:53:40,638 --> 00:53:42,763
Hey, Micky, bring another bucket, huh?

755
00:53:45,316 --> 00:53:46,209
Good.

756
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:59,988
And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.

757
00:54:00,011 --> 00:54:03,169
Right here in Lowell, Mass.,
the story of Dick Eklund,

758
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,893
the once promising boxer who turned criminal.

759
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:22,414
Oh, look who it is.

760
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,490
That's...
That's Dicky's brother.

761
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,592
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

762
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:32,027
Hey.

763
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:35,855
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Look who's here.

764
00:54:38,391 --> 00:54:40,769
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

765
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,552
How you feeling?
How's the hand?

766
00:54:43,576 --> 00:54:46,769
- Uh, it's getting there.
- Looks better.

767
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:49,971
Why don't you come down to the gym?
We'll work out, if you want.

768
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:53,942
- You fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. It's just...

769
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:56,466
Roofing for my father and
spending more time with Kasie.

770
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,627
By the way, this movie on HBO, man.

771
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,057
What are you boys looking at?

772
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:03,477
The movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

773
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:04,749
I should go.

774
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:08,443
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick.

775
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:11,364
Don't go watch that crazy shit on TV.
Don't.

776
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:25,551
Going to Hollywood...

777
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:45,573
Let's get this started!

778
00:55:57,415 --> 00:56:00,726
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.

779
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:05,401
- Oh, that's...
- These people came to find...

780
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,701
I used to live over there.
This town's got good memories, right?

781
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:10,392
- Check it out.
- Fuck yeah.

782
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,617
This house right up this way,
the white house...

783
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,418
- Oh, yeah!
- First time I got my crack over here.

784
00:56:16,442 --> 00:56:18,755
Did you ever know they
smoke crack at the white house?

785
00:56:22,357 --> 00:56:24,929
The first time I did crack or whatever,
I was about twenty-three.

786
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:28,304
A friend of mine gave me a gram or whatever.
Fuck I wish that never happened.

787
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:32,350
Before that,
I'd be doing the silver mittens and stuff.

788
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:36,248
I was the only kid.
I'd be twelve. I'm shit-faced.

789
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,751
I'll tell you how crack was.

790
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:44,032
It enters your lungs.
When it enters your lungs,

791
00:56:44,056 --> 00:56:46,880
- I want to watch Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

792
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:51,088
- No, sweetie. You go back upstairs.
- But I want to watch Daddy on TV.

793
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,468
No, you can't.
You can't watch Daddy now, all right?

794
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:56,876
You go back upstairs and go to bed, okay?

795
00:56:56,893 --> 00:56:59,312
Okay, this is my boy, here. Check it out.

796
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:01,358
What... What can I sell you today?
A python?

797
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,846
Yeah, check it out, man.
They're going to buy me some.

798
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:11,855
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.

799
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:17,319
Never thought I'd kiss a fucking snake.
I always dreamed about it, but...

800
00:57:17,331 --> 00:57:21,133
You do a lot of shit when you're high, right?

801
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,559
Heck, yeah.
Put it all on the map.

802
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:28,754
You knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down,
didn't you say?

803
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,836
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockout.

804
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:35,630
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

805
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:38,150
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

806
00:57:38,162 --> 00:57:40,779
- Oh, Jack...
- Come on.

807
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,295
That's a fucking lie!

808
00:57:42,312 --> 00:57:44,367
They say he's in trouble with drugs...

809
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:47,047
What are you doing?
Are you talking shit about the family?

810
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:49,090
- No, not at all.
- Yeah. I heard you say.

811
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:52,495
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.

812
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:55,912
I thought he could make a comeback
and make us proud, but he didn't.

813
00:57:55,923 --> 00:57:58,941
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.
- Very disappointing.

814
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:02,939
You brought the city of Lowell
back thirty years. We're not happy.

815
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:04,665
- Hello?
- Jimmy.

816
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,483
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

817
00:58:07,495 --> 00:58:09,286
Actually, we were watching it right now, Mick,

818
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:12,163
but don't worry about it.
I got it...

819
00:58:12,186 --> 00:58:13,901
I want her to see it.

820
00:58:13,912 --> 00:58:15,404
Let her see who her uncle is.

821
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:16,918
- What?
- Who you are.

822
00:58:16,942 --> 00:58:19,195
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

823
00:58:19,218 --> 00:58:22,529
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.

824
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:26,004
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it. She's a kid.

825
00:58:27,072 --> 00:58:29,659
If you're on crack,

826
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:33,288
you feel so much lighter.

827
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:36,494
You know, you feel young.
And everything is so funny.

828
00:58:36,506 --> 00:58:42,827
Everything is just...
Everything is...

829
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:44,150
It wasn't funny.

830
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:51,854
And then it fades,
then you've got to get high again.

831
00:58:56,904 --> 00:59:00,941
Your part of the movie's going to end
with you going to jail.

832
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:06,190
We know Dicky.
We're going to take care of him, huh?

833
00:59:09,348 --> 00:59:10,910
You guys can't talk to him.

834
00:59:15,504 --> 00:59:17,880
Turn that shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

835
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,098
Turn it off.
Will you turn this off?

836
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,236
I'm turning it fucking off.

837
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,640
Hey, that's my life.
That's my fucking life up there.

838
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:32,481
- I want to watch this.
- I don't care. I will fuck you up.

839
00:59:32,493 --> 00:59:35,917
You fucking want some?
Don't fucking try me.

840
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:39,111
I still fucking won it, okay?
You fucking want some?

841
00:59:39,974 --> 00:59:42,639
That's my son there.
You're laughing at him?

842
00:59:44,306 --> 00:59:49,241
That's my son, he's crying, he needs me,
and I'm fucking stuck in here?

843
00:59:52,406 --> 00:59:55,036
Micky, are you watching this?

844
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,049
What are they doing to us?

845
00:59:58,914 --> 01:00:02,026
I don't know what to tell you.

846
01:00:02,049 --> 01:00:05,692
You're pretending like you don't know what's going on.
He's been doing this for years.

847
01:00:06,991 --> 01:00:09,285
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Mom.

848
01:00:14,254 --> 01:00:15,780
What do you think?

849
01:00:15,802 --> 01:00:19,090
- You think they set him up?
- Mom, what do you think he was doing?

850
01:00:19,102 --> 01:00:22,577
You know, they gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie, right?

851
01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:27,217
Micky?

852
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,313
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

853
01:02:50,336 --> 01:02:52,884
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

854
01:02:52,905 --> 01:02:54,338
- What happened to the peanut?
- Don't know.

855
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:57,863
Like a beach ball.

856
01:04:23,604 --> 01:04:24,931
Good job.

857
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:29,257
- Mick, Sal Lanano.
- Hey, Mick. How you doing?

858
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:32,641
- You own the cab company. Good businessman, right?
- He's very organized.

859
01:04:32,653 --> 01:04:35,048
- How's the hand?
- It's good, you know?

860
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,337
It's getting better. Stronger.

861
01:04:37,362 --> 01:04:40,967
You know, I made a few calls already.
I just talked to Buddy Tags.

862
01:04:40,979 --> 01:04:45,626
He said he can set up something local.
You know, something to start back with.

863
01:04:45,637 --> 01:04:48,303
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it. You've got to get your confidence back.

864
01:04:48,326 --> 01:04:49,982
That's all.

865
01:04:51,297 --> 01:04:53,876
Your dad wants Sal to manage you,

866
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,849
and he wants me to train you,

867
01:04:55,872 --> 01:04:58,502
but he'll only do it on one condition.

868
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:04,452
- No crazy time nonsense.
- That's how it's got to be.

869
01:05:04,463 --> 01:05:08,365
- No Dicky, no Alice.
- No Dicky, no Alice.

870
01:05:08,376 --> 01:05:12,040
I get it. I get it. I'm good. I understand.
Look, I appreciate the opportunity.

871
01:05:12,064 --> 01:05:14,990
Can't take the bullshit, Mick.
No offense, George.

872
01:05:14,996 --> 01:05:19,513
None taken. I mean, I'm going to be
the one that gets his balls cut off anyway.

873
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:22,630
Yeah, you laugh.

874
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:25,917
- You traitor!
- What are you doing?

875
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:29,433
What the hell's the matter with you?

876
01:05:31,378 --> 01:05:33,187
Did that hurt? I hope it hurt!

877
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:35,976
- Sal Lanano is a good man!
- A good man?

878
01:05:35,988 --> 01:05:39,205
- He's a legitimate businessman!
- Legitimate businessman?

879
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:41,967
- What?
- Oh, my God, you know what that sounds like?

880
01:05:41,978 --> 01:05:44,632
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxicab company!

881
01:05:44,655 --> 01:05:46,968
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God, he's a cab driver.

882
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:49,298
- He knows everything about boxing, right?
- Yes.

883
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:53,302
I don't think so! I think he's going to
steal your son's money and rob him blind!

884
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:56,085
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

885
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:58,692
- Why can't you trust anybody?
- I know people.

886
01:05:58,716 --> 01:06:01,324
I know, George. You think I don't
know anything. But I know people.

887
01:06:01,338 --> 01:06:05,354
- I know you know things...
- And that Sal Lanana banana fucking thing...

888
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:09,076
- We don't need that in our lives!
- We haven't made one dollar with these kids.

889
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,987
- You betrayed me. You betrayed me.
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

890
01:06:11,999 --> 01:06:14,312
- You're always have to say...
- He's a fucking crook!

891
01:06:14,328 --> 01:06:17,252
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail.

892
01:06:17,275 --> 01:06:23,197
We're not talking about his trainer, sweetheart.
We're talking about his manager, that's me!

893
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:25,639
Yeah, but Mom, maybe Micky should
try something different...

894
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:27,787
What are you doing,
opening your mouth in my kitchen?

895
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,147
You owe me $200.

896
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,821
I said I was going to pay you next week.

897
01:06:31,845 --> 01:06:35,449
I don't want another word out of you.
That was last month you told me two weeks.

898
01:06:35,469 --> 01:06:38,745
Do you take sides against me in my own house?
You owe me money?

899
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,651
Mom's been great to Micky, Sherri.

900
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,716
Really, who's going to look after Micky
better than his own mother?

901
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:47,090
It's that fucking girl, Charlene.
We've got to get rid of her, Mom.

902
01:06:47,114 --> 01:06:49,744
We've got to get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She's got to go.

903
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:53,319
You're going to get Charlene involved in this?
Is that what you're all telling me?

904
01:06:53,332 --> 01:06:54,952
- Huh?
- I know where she lives.

905
01:06:54,964 --> 01:06:56,467
What are you picking on her for?

906
01:06:56,484 --> 01:06:59,466
- She lives in that yellow house on Steven Street.
- Yeah, the puke yellow.

907
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:02,272
I'm going to talk to Micky.
Sort this out for myself.

908
01:07:02,296 --> 01:07:08,836
Yeah, sure. You go handle it with
your vigilantes. This is wrong, Alice!

909
01:07:16,008 --> 01:07:18,825
- I got it.
- Get out of my way!

910
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:24,598
Get in the car.

911
01:07:47,178 --> 01:07:48,677
Micky, are you in there?

912
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:50,492
Up in there on the second floor.

913
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:51,630
Micky!

914
01:07:52,577 --> 01:07:54,632
Where the hell are you, huh?

915
01:07:54,656 --> 01:07:56,616
Are you up there? Come on down.

916
01:07:56,628 --> 01:07:58,601
Where are you?

917
01:07:59,399 --> 01:08:02,097
Holy shit, Micky.
Your mother and your sisters are here.

918
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,349
No, no.
Do not go out there, please.

919
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:08,572
No, I'm not hiding
from your crazy fucking family.

920
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:21,554
Hi.

921
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:23,777
Well, well, well. Look at this.

922
01:08:23,789 --> 01:08:25,123
Look at what?

923
01:08:26,029 --> 01:08:28,401
Why are you hiding from us, Micky?

924
01:08:28,425 --> 01:08:30,189
- He's not hiding.
- I wasn't talking to you.

925
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:31,973
I was talking to my son.

926
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:36,038
- What are you doing next to her?
- I'm right here. I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

927
01:08:36,059 --> 01:08:39,652
Well you're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend, Lanano.

928
01:08:39,674 --> 01:08:42,539
What are you going to do?
Turn your back on Dicky next, huh?

929
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,818
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

930
01:08:46,842 --> 01:08:49,648
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

931
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,067
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank!

932
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,738
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that
nasty hair right out of your fucking head.

933
01:08:55,748 --> 01:08:59,353
- I'm his mother and his manager.
- You're not my manager anymore.

934
01:08:59,365 --> 01:09:02,919
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, okay?
I'm not getting any younger.

935
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,843
- Who's going to look after you, sweetheart?
- How about me?

936
01:09:05,866 --> 01:09:08,382
I know you don't understand it
but I had nine kids,

937
01:09:08,406 --> 01:09:10,366
and I love every one of you the same.

938
01:09:10,382 --> 01:09:12,449
You've got a funny way of showing it,
letting him get beat up,

939
01:09:12,473 --> 01:09:15,607
- letting him get his hand broken.
- You're crazy.

940
01:09:15,995 --> 01:09:18,651
What did I just say to you?

941
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:25,791
Let go!

942
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:34,299
Fuck!

943
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,302
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

944
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:39,591
Fuck you, Charlene!

945
01:09:39,603 --> 01:09:41,666
- Skank!
- I want them the fuck out of here.

946
01:09:42,043 --> 01:09:45,436
- You're fucking dead.
- Fucking bitch!

947
01:09:46,146 --> 01:09:49,280
Gail! Oh, my God.
What did she do to your nose?

948
01:09:50,652 --> 01:09:52,677
Let's get the hell out of here.

949
01:09:57,928 --> 01:10:01,345
What's happening to everybody?
I don't understand, sweetheart.

950
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:52,104
Why do you think I spell my name with an "E"?
Because I don't.

951
01:10:52,116 --> 01:10:54,911
- "No E" Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push that.

952
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,988
- Where are we going?
- To the ring. The ring's across the street.

953
01:10:59,012 --> 01:11:01,125
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

954
01:11:01,149 --> 01:11:03,715
Smaller venue. They've got
no dressing rooms over there.

955
01:11:03,735 --> 01:11:05,715
It's a starter, Micky.

956
01:11:09,952 --> 01:11:10,950
Hey.

957
01:11:12,183 --> 01:11:13,401
Good luck.

958
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,537
That's it. That's it.

959
01:11:29,499 --> 01:11:31,214
Yeah!

960
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:37,519
Yeah!

961
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:00,964
Visit for Dick Eklund.

962
01:13:00,988 --> 01:13:02,538
Dicky!

963
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:08,844
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

964
01:13:10,314 --> 01:13:14,412
I know you know what I'm doing.
I'm sure Alice and everybody else told you.

965
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:17,876
I just wanted to tell you to your face myself.

966
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:21,060
I've got a new manager and
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

967
01:13:21,499 --> 01:13:22,696
It's going good.

968
01:13:23,694 --> 01:13:27,004
Yeah. They've got you fighting Alfonso Sanchez.

969
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,130
- On HBO.
- Bet you're proud of that.

970
01:13:29,147 --> 01:13:32,506
- Fucking right.
- HBO is the best at the Mexican fight. Wake up.

971
01:13:32,529 --> 01:13:35,816
I didn't think they were
going to be invested in me.

972
01:13:35,837 --> 01:13:38,432
- I've got a shot. I'm going to take it.
- Wake up.

973
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:40,689
They don't care if it kills you.

974
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,247
Mike Toma did it. He's using you.

975
01:13:43,258 --> 01:13:45,485
Like a stepping stone for Sanchez.

976
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:50,257
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

977
01:13:50,258 --> 01:13:54,112
How could I stand a chance without
the great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

978
01:13:54,136 --> 01:13:56,728
You didn't give a fuck if I got
killed by Mungin,

979
01:13:56,747 --> 01:13:59,025
now, all of the sudden, you're worried
Sanchez is going to hurt me?

980
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,132
Why?

981
01:14:00,155 --> 01:14:03,314
Come on, Dick. Because you're stuck in here
and can't be the center of attention no more?

982
01:14:03,331 --> 01:14:05,568
- You need it that bad?
- It's a Mexican fight.

983
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:08,429
He fights you,
hits like a fucking mule, all right?

984
01:14:08,438 --> 01:14:10,644
Fifteen counts undefeated. You crazy?

985
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:13,474
And that taxicab idiot, Lanano?
He went right for it.

986
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:16,222
He's a paper gangster.
He's using you to steal money.

987
01:14:16,236 --> 01:14:18,966
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

988
01:14:19,553 --> 01:14:22,751
I've spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

989
01:14:22,772 --> 01:14:27,226
I've finally got a good thing going for me,
and you can't be fucking happy for me? Why?

990
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,666
What's your plan?
How are you going to fight Sanchez?

991
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:32,615
I ain't going to talk about that.

992
01:14:32,631 --> 01:14:34,261
What's your plan?

993
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:38,418
- I'm not here to talk about that.
- Bullshit. Yes you are.

994
01:14:39,546 --> 01:14:41,567
You watch the fight and you'll see the plan.

995
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:45,019
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fucking violent, you know?

996
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:46,258
Two minutes, Dicky.

997
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:52,989
They let us watch a stupid documentary about crack,
but I can't watch my own brother fighting.

998
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:56,245
Hey, Mick. What is it?

999
01:14:57,044 --> 01:15:01,500
You scared? You embarrassed because you don't
even have a plan? I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1000
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:05,012
- You're going to shit on it no matter what I say.
- I'm not going to shit on it. Just tell me.

1001
01:15:08,257 --> 01:15:12,379
Go toe-to-toe, overhand right in middle rounds.
He's weak against overhand right.

1002
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:18,085
- Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe?
- Fuck you, Dicky.

1003
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,962
You've got to run against this guy.
Let him burn himself out.

1004
01:15:20,973 --> 01:15:23,438
Take it to the body, right?
Get inside, switch stances

1005
01:15:23,462 --> 01:15:26,239
like you're going to work his right.
Hit him on the left.

1006
01:15:26,263 --> 01:15:28,588
You ain't me.
Okay, you can't be me.

1007
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:31,652
You had a hard enough time being you
when you had your fucking chance,

1008
01:15:31,672 --> 01:15:33,597
and that's why you're in here, all right?

1009
01:15:33,621 --> 01:15:35,159
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1010
01:15:35,168 --> 01:15:37,774
I'm talking about the way you fight,
you moron!

1011
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:41,884
- You know I'm right. He knows I'm right.
- All right.

1012
01:15:45,368 --> 01:15:47,165
Blow to the right.

1013
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:54,808
Ward just in.
29 wins, 7 losses so far.

1014
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,642
Twenty KOs. He's been a little better
since he refocused himself on the sport,

1015
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:01,200
as J.B. pointed out.

1016
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:09,366
Now here's Ward's opponent, Alfonso Sanchez,

1017
01:16:09,389 --> 01:16:14,541
out of Tijuana, Mexico.
See the record, 16 wins, 15 KOs,

1018
01:16:14,552 --> 01:16:16,389
8 first-round KOs.

1019
01:16:16,401 --> 01:16:20,487
There's Mike Toma, the promoter of the fight,
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1020
01:16:20,502 --> 01:16:24,345
He says that Sanchez is one of the most
talented young prospects

1021
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:26,141
in the sport of boxing.

1022
01:16:35,297 --> 01:16:41,215
This is really one of the saddest
kinds of fights in boxing.

1023
01:16:41,238 --> 01:16:45,420
Micky Ward is 31 years old.
He's here because he needs the money.

1024
01:16:45,432 --> 01:16:47,720
- He's taking a beating.
- My point is that

1025
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:50,010
he doesn't really have to sit here
and take this beating.

1026
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:52,547
- He can do something about it.
- Which is what?

1027
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:55,154
- Have his corner throw in the towel?
- Or fight back.

1028
01:16:58,357 --> 01:17:01,445
You can see his power.
Every time he hits Ward, he backs him up.

1029
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:08,640
- Unless the referee thinks he can't...
- The referee should just stop this fight.

1030
01:17:08,652 --> 01:17:10,777
We know that Micky doesn't want to be here.

1031
01:17:10,794 --> 01:17:13,588
- I wouldn't make the crowd...
- No, he's fighting scared, Dick.

1032
01:17:14,738 --> 01:17:16,793
Running away, not hitting back.

1033
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:20,306
Oh, Jesus. He's going to get hurt.

1034
01:17:20,317 --> 01:17:25,062
Doing the same old shit.
Never seen such an embarrassing performance.

1035
01:17:25,084 --> 01:17:27,139
He's doing what I told him, Mom.
He's doing what I told him.

1036
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:28,994
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1037
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,876
Micky Ward showing nothing but respect.

1038
01:17:31,894 --> 01:17:33,808
What are you running around for?
Stop running around.

1039
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:37,033
Shut the fuck up, Sal.
Shut the fuck up!

1040
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:39,896
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
You want to fucking tell me?

1041
01:17:39,908 --> 01:17:42,291
Because I don't know what you're doing.
We'd have lost all five rounds.

1042
01:17:42,308 --> 01:17:44,246
Is that what you want?

1043
01:17:44,263 --> 01:17:46,342
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1044
01:17:46,365 --> 01:17:48,719
You've got to show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm going to stop the fight.

1045
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:50,227
They're going to stop the fight, Micky.

1046
01:17:50,236 --> 01:17:52,138
He's got to go inside, Mom.

1047
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:55,164
He's got to take it to the body.
He's got it.

1048
01:17:55,165 --> 01:17:58,124
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're going to stop this fight.

1049
01:17:58,135 --> 01:18:00,718
You've got to do something, baby.
You've got to do something.

1050
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:04,244
Try what we talked about, Micky.
We had a plan, and you're not doing it.

1051
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:06,247
- Let's go.
- All right, Micky.

1052
01:18:06,259 --> 01:18:10,791
You've lost the first five rounds,
what's the next strategy going to be?

1053
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:14,176
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1054
01:18:14,177 --> 01:18:18,389
Couple of the left hooks landed flush
on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1055
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:20,583
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1056
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:23,696
Very curious performance by Micky Ward.

1057
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:29,159
Ward seems to be trying to land one big shot
to either change Sanchez's mind...

1058
01:18:29,179 --> 01:18:33,688
And he's beginning to open up, taking
advantage of opportunities to get close to Ward

1059
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:39,464
and throw against a fighter who is
not defending himself by punching.

1060
01:18:39,484 --> 01:18:42,312
Sanchez is going to try to end this fight.

1061
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,118
What are you doing? Come on.

1062
01:18:52,193 --> 01:18:52,887
Come on!

1063
01:18:53,832 --> 01:18:56,333
He's down on an uppercut.

1064
01:18:59,261 --> 01:19:02,059
Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.

1065
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:06,261
Very good. And right after Ward
threw a pretty good right hand.

1066
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:07,523
Mick, you all right?

1067
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:12,555
This is a fight that should be stopped.

1068
01:19:12,566 --> 01:19:15,554
- Come on, head, body, head.
- Ugh.

1069
01:19:17,101 --> 01:19:21,492
- This is not professional.
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

1070
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:23,605
I sure wish they paid me to watch this.

1071
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:27,477
Come on, Mick!
Head, body, head.

1072
01:19:28,743 --> 01:19:31,573
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1073
01:19:31,587 --> 01:19:35,210
- Maybe he'll turn it around.
- I'm talking about his body shot.

1074
01:19:36,486 --> 01:19:39,138
Sanchez dropped by that shot!
Oh, my God!

1075
01:19:39,151 --> 01:19:40,754
What a punch!

1076
01:19:40,766 --> 01:19:43,516
The most unlikely knockout
you have ever seen!

1077
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,382
That is a kidney shot,

1078
01:19:45,383 --> 01:19:49,069
The kind of kidney shot that's not as severe...

1079
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,532
Yeah!

1080
01:19:51,133 --> 01:19:54,220
I still don't believe what I just saw!

1081
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:58,302
Micky! Micky! Micky!

1082
01:19:58,314 --> 01:19:59,887
Micky won!

1083
01:20:01,783 --> 01:20:06,808
Now did Micky Ward just make idiots of us all
with a spectacular piece of strategy?

1084
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:09,287
- Take another look.
- Amazing.

1085
01:20:09,298 --> 01:20:11,588
A big win in the career of Micky Ward
of Lowell, Mass.

1086
01:20:11,605 --> 01:20:15,151
Unbelievable defeat at the hands of Micky Ward,

1087
01:20:15,168 --> 01:20:19,595
who had all but given away the first
half dozen rounds in the bout.

1088
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:23,602
I think what Micky did was he recognized
that he'd hurt the guy with the body shot.

1089
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:26,772
Micky's a better fighter than that
to not be running from that guy like that.

1090
01:20:26,795 --> 01:20:28,979
Theater of the unexpected.

1091
01:20:29,002 --> 01:20:31,727
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1092
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,858
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1093
01:20:33,883 --> 01:20:35,539
You can't make it up, folks.

1094
01:20:35,556 --> 01:20:39,031
You know what Micky just said?
He said you can't give up in this game.

1095
01:20:39,032 --> 01:20:42,390
Well maybe Micky Ward heard me say
he should stop this fight,

1096
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:45,619
- and he went out and stopped it.
- Yeah.

1097
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:47,276
I can't believe it.

1098
01:20:47,288 --> 01:20:50,429
I'm looking over and I'm thinking
to myself like they were thinking:

1099
01:20:50,435 --> 01:20:51,668
This thing is over.

1100
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:53,782
But I tell you what.
Even look at the commentators.

1101
01:20:53,793 --> 01:20:57,198
They started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1102
01:20:57,222 --> 01:20:59,535
- They just wanted to get out of there.
- Mick. Mick...

1103
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:02,699
I just spoke to Mike Toma again and
he just told me something very interesting.

1104
01:21:02,711 --> 01:21:07,674
He just told me, had Sanchez won tonight,
he would have gotten the title shot.

1105
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:10,793
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1106
01:21:10,816 --> 01:21:15,584
- A title shot.
- Micky gets the shot.

1107
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:18,239
- Are you sure about that?
- You've got to be very clear about this,

1108
01:21:18,251 --> 01:21:20,506
- because this is my kid's future.
- I just spoke to the guy.

1109
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:23,981
- Mike, come here. Look, tell these guys.
- Hey. Congratulations.

1110
01:21:23,987 --> 01:21:25,889
- Thank you.
- Not a stepping stone anymore.

1111
01:21:25,902 --> 01:21:28,509
I always knew you had the talent.
That was a hell of a strategy,

1112
01:21:28,532 --> 01:21:31,081
wearing him down like that
and taking it to the body.

1113
01:21:31,104 --> 01:21:33,753
Thirty years in the business,
I've never seen a knockout like that.

1114
01:21:33,757 --> 01:21:37,233
Larry Merchant was writing your obituary
and Sanchez drops like he was shot with a gun.

1115
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:38,760
Where did you get that?

1116
01:21:38,772 --> 01:21:41,966
That's the first thing my brother taught me.
Tap them to the head, dig into the body.

1117
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:43,989
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1118
01:21:43,996 --> 01:21:45,382
You ready for a title shot?

1119
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:48,190
- Yes!
- Yes!

1120
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,836
- That's what I was talking about.
- He's ready. You're ready, aren't you?

1121
01:21:51,842 --> 01:21:55,481
Shea Neary in London for the title!

1122
01:21:55,505 --> 01:21:57,806
Are you kidding me?
We've got some celebrating to do.

1123
01:21:57,817 --> 01:21:59,755
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1124
01:21:59,778 --> 01:22:02,263
You're going to have
a great champion, my boy.

1125
01:22:04,311 --> 01:22:06,659
It's what your brother
would have always wanted.

1126
01:22:06,683 --> 01:22:08,291
He's not even going to be there.

1127
01:22:34,429 --> 01:22:37,658
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1128
01:22:37,672 --> 01:22:39,880
- Hey there, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1129
01:22:40,988 --> 01:22:44,288
Good to see you! Oh!

1130
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:48,498
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Oh yeah!

1131
01:22:48,504 --> 01:22:50,829
- Sweetheart!
- Hi, Mom.

1132
01:22:50,852 --> 01:22:53,412
Oh, you look so good.

1133
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:54,973
Oh, my God.

1134
01:23:03,706 --> 01:23:06,699
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1135
01:23:06,711 --> 01:23:08,930
I got new teeth. Everything.

1136
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:10,415
How do you think I look?

1137
01:23:10,427 --> 01:23:11,789
- Good.
- Yeah?

1138
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,608
- Are you going to carry me?
- No.

1139
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:28,508
And more cake. Ice cream...

1140
01:23:28,532 --> 01:23:32,594
- Ice cream with cake.
- Ice cream with cake and cake and cake.

1141
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:36,287
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake.

1142
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:37,429
Quacker!

1143
01:23:43,178 --> 01:23:44,152
Mom.

1144
01:23:57,602 --> 01:24:00,185
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1145
01:24:05,079 --> 01:24:08,414
- Hey, George. They let you out of the house now?
- Ha, yeah.

1146
01:24:08,425 --> 01:24:12,241
- Run him out of the house, Mom?
- Hey, look. I want you to meet Sal Lanano.

1147
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:20,613
How you doing, Dicky?

1148
01:24:22,964 --> 01:24:24,749
Let's spar, huh?

1149
01:24:32,664 --> 01:24:33,779
Hi, Charlene.

1150
01:24:59,926 --> 01:25:03,143
- Welcome back!
- Shh! It's supposed to be a surprise!

1151
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,116
I'm running late.

1152
01:25:05,127 --> 01:25:07,393
- Hey.
- Hey.

1153
01:25:07,408 --> 01:25:11,025
Mick, I can't even tell you.
Being back in this smelly-ass locker room...

1154
01:25:11,036 --> 01:25:13,796
Getting back with you is what got me through.

1155
01:25:13,803 --> 01:25:15,623
You look good. Your eyes are clear.

1156
01:25:15,646 --> 01:25:18,171
- Yeah?
- You know...

1157
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:22,072
Alice says prison might have been
the best thing for me.

1158
01:25:22,088 --> 01:25:25,411
It got me clean. Got me clear up here.

1159
01:25:26,867 --> 01:25:28,653
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1160
01:25:30,223 --> 01:25:32,225
I've got to talk to you about something.

1161
01:25:33,076 --> 01:25:33,863
Yeah.

1162
01:25:36,644 --> 01:25:38,687
The old locker, huh?

1163
01:25:41,706 --> 01:25:44,465
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1164
01:25:53,254 --> 01:25:54,240
Huh?

1165
01:25:55,038 --> 01:25:58,312
I had to, after everything that happened.
I'm sorry.

1166
01:26:03,634 --> 01:26:05,456
You sticking to that?

1167
01:26:07,594 --> 01:26:09,367
I'm glad you're back.

1168
01:26:09,895 --> 01:26:11,187
You look good.

1169
01:26:12,338 --> 01:26:14,393
I don't know what else to say.

1170
01:26:22,172 --> 01:26:25,177
- Mick, you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1171
01:26:30,053 --> 01:26:32,507
- Hey, Micky.
- Micky, come on in.

1172
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:35,787
You're too loud.
You've got to do this at home, please.

1173
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,655
- What are you talking about?
- Mom, please.

1174
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,456
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1175
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,005
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1176
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:14,833
If that's what Micky wants,
we're going to put it away.

1177
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:17,653
- There's your brother.
- Dicky!

1178
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:21,128
Hey there. Hey there.

1179
01:27:24,783 --> 01:27:27,270
It's nice. It's nice.

1180
01:27:27,765 --> 01:27:30,454
- Been working on it for two weeks.
- Hey, Sherri, come on. Stop.

1181
01:27:30,477 --> 01:27:34,434
All right, girls, come on. Let's go home.
It's not the time to do this, obviously.

1182
01:27:39,699 --> 01:27:43,347
- What's going on?
- We ain't going to work together.

1183
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,332
They don't want me to work with him.

1184
01:27:45,355 --> 01:27:47,330
What are you talking about?

1185
01:27:47,777 --> 01:27:49,655
That's not right.

1186
01:27:50,096 --> 01:27:52,984
Micky never would have
won Sanchez without Dicky.

1187
01:27:53,007 --> 01:27:56,694
- That's fucking bullshit! Take it back!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1188
01:27:56,706 --> 01:28:00,393
- Don't you fucking talk to my mother like that.
- Fuck you!

1189
01:28:02,913 --> 01:28:04,867
Why don't you ask Micky?

1190
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,809
We're going to train. They've got to go.

1191
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:09,795
They've got to go, Mick.
Come on.

1192
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:11,688
- You all right?
- Ask him, George.

1193
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,643
Ask him if he would have won Sanchez
without his brother.

1194
01:28:18,347 --> 01:28:21,126
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1195
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:24,892
- How can you say that to O'Keefe?
- Because it's true.

1196
01:28:25,568 --> 01:28:29,480
I went in with our game plan and it wasn't working
so I went back to what I learned with Dicky.

1197
01:28:29,494 --> 01:28:32,194
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, okay?

1198
01:28:33,134 --> 01:28:36,303
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1199
01:28:36,314 --> 01:28:39,011
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1200
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:41,876
and from Sal,
and from your father, and from me.

1201
01:28:44,314 --> 01:28:46,087
- Dicky is a junk bag.
- Hey!

1202
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:47,437
He's a junk bag!

1203
01:28:47,449 --> 01:28:49,032
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Oh, fuck you!

1204
01:28:49,056 --> 01:28:50,118
I'm sober.

1205
01:28:50,121 --> 01:28:52,869
Oh, yeah. And I'm sure you're going to need
something for something now that you're out.

1206
01:28:52,893 --> 01:28:54,642
- "Oh, my back! Oh, my back!"
- Fuck you!

1207
01:28:54,659 --> 01:28:56,949
- What are you always picking on me for, huh?
- No, fuck you!

1208
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:59,324
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1209
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:02,101
One day at a fucking time, right, O'Keefe?
You and me.

1210
01:29:02,111 --> 01:29:04,858
It's all right for him to be here?
Why am I the fucking problem?

1211
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:07,018
- I'm his blood! I'm his family!
- You're the problem!

1212
01:29:07,038 --> 01:29:10,596
I'm the one fighting, okay?
Not you, not you, and not you.

1213
01:29:11,949 --> 01:29:13,883
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1214
01:29:13,906 --> 01:29:15,327
I want Dicky back.

1215
01:29:16,822 --> 01:29:19,100
And I want you, Charlene,
and I want O'Keefe.

1216
01:29:19,112 --> 01:29:21,355
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1217
01:29:23,473 --> 01:29:26,467
- Not the deal we made, baby.
- She's right, Micky.

1218
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:29,173
- That's not the deal.
- It wasn't the deal.

1219
01:29:29,196 --> 01:29:31,082
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1220
01:29:31,105 --> 01:29:32,362
You sound like them now.

1221
01:29:32,373 --> 01:29:34,158
- I sound like them now?
- Yeah, you sound like them.

1222
01:29:34,181 --> 01:29:37,715
- We sound like them?
- You can't do this to us. You can't do this to us.

1223
01:29:37,725 --> 01:29:39,076
You sound like them.

1224
01:29:40,446 --> 01:29:42,254
You should fucking listen to yourself.

1225
01:29:42,267 --> 01:29:44,920
You sound like them, just like them.
Maybe this is where you belong.

1226
01:29:44,932 --> 01:29:47,311
- That's the way you love him?
- Charlene!

1227
01:29:47,334 --> 01:29:50,715
- Come on!
- You want your brother? Good luck.

1228
01:29:50,739 --> 01:29:53,424
- O'Keefe, come on...
- Micky.

1229
01:29:53,436 --> 01:29:54,481
Micky...

1230
01:29:57,563 --> 01:29:59,991
Come on,
everything happens for a reason.

1231
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:02,840
You know, maybe it's for the best.

1232
01:30:04,354 --> 01:30:05,951
God has a plan.

1233
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:10,603
Want to spar with your brother?

1234
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:18,995
Dick Eklund, Pride of Lowell.

1235
01:30:20,299 --> 01:30:22,330
Watching that for years, huh?

1236
01:30:25,976 --> 01:30:29,217
Whoa, hey, what the hell are you doing?

1237
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:32,740
- Micky, for crying out loud!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1238
01:30:32,745 --> 01:30:36,590
Take that baby out of here.
I told you take him away ten minutes ago!

1239
01:30:36,596 --> 01:30:39,379
Sweetheart, are you all right?
You okay? Your back?

1240
01:30:40,758 --> 01:30:43,804
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1241
01:30:43,816 --> 01:30:45,930
Will it be my fight, Alice? Huh?

1242
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:50,057
Just once? Maybe just
this one time, not for Dicky?

1243
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,430
Huh?

1244
01:30:51,448 --> 01:30:53,573
I know you think he's coming back,

1245
01:30:53,596 --> 01:30:57,189
but he's forty years old and he doesn't have
a tooth in his head that's his fucking own.

1246
01:30:57,206 --> 01:31:00,576
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1247
01:31:00,594 --> 01:31:05,176
- What are you saying, sweetheart?
- Shut up before I bust your fucking head open, Dicky.

1248
01:31:05,188 --> 01:31:08,223
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What are you going to do?

1249
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:11,295
- You want me to bust your fucking head open?
- Come on! Come on! George!

1250
01:31:11,318 --> 01:31:13,224
- Please! Please!
- Dicky!

1251
01:31:13,246 --> 01:31:15,794
What are you saying, sweetheart?
Tell me what you're saying.

1252
01:31:15,818 --> 01:31:17,732
This is supposed to be my fight.

1253
01:31:17,756 --> 01:31:19,200
- This is my shot at a title.
- It is your fight.

1254
01:31:19,212 --> 01:31:20,480
I won't get another one after this.

1255
01:31:20,504 --> 01:31:23,005
Am I being selfish?
Am I saying "Micky! Micky! Micky!"?

1256
01:31:23,028 --> 01:31:24,994
Because you know what?
If I am, I'm sorry.

1257
01:31:25,008 --> 01:31:28,983
I thought I was fighting for the championship.
And I thought you were my mother, too.

1258
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,962
I am your mother.

1259
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:41,144
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1260
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:44,266
If I made mistakes,
I'm going to be better.

1261
01:31:44,277 --> 01:31:48,093
I don't want to hurt you.
I am so sorry.

1262
01:31:48,117 --> 01:31:50,054
I'm sorry.

1263
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,436
Dicky!
Stay with him.

1264
01:31:58,364 --> 01:31:59,890
Dicky!

1265
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:02,790
Dicky!

1266
01:32:07,686 --> 01:32:09,835
- Dicky!
- Got to do something.

1267
01:32:09,847 --> 01:32:11,749
Dicky, wait. Come on.

1268
01:32:12,688 --> 01:32:15,060
Micky wants you. I want you.

1269
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:19,065
- I've got to do something.
- I know what that means. Don't do this!

1270
01:32:47,315 --> 01:32:49,194
Hey, Jim.

1271
01:32:53,937 --> 01:32:55,358
- Smart.
- Hey, Dicky.

1272
01:32:58,286 --> 01:33:00,705
- Hey, Dicky's back!
- Yay!

1273
01:33:00,728 --> 01:33:02,395
- Hey!
- Dicky!

1274
01:33:03,608 --> 01:33:06,109
- Look at you!
- Look at my boy, huh?

1275
01:33:06,121 --> 01:33:07,260
Come over here.

1276
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,941
You look good. Welcome back.

1277
01:33:08,955 --> 01:33:11,409
- Yeah, you're looking good.
- You look great.

1278
01:33:11,433 --> 01:33:13,441
Good to see you.

1279
01:33:13,459 --> 01:33:16,194
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1280
01:33:17,855 --> 01:33:19,722
What's up, man? You're looking good.

1281
01:33:19,725 --> 01:33:22,003
So, want to head up there?

1282
01:33:22,026 --> 01:33:23,423
Dicky's back!

1283
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:31,662
Go upstairs, take a while, huh?

1284
01:33:39,467 --> 01:33:42,332
- Throw a little party for you, babe.
- Hey, come back!

1285
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:46,850
- The fuck was that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1286
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,399
Charlene, it's Dicky.

1287
01:34:06,303 --> 01:34:08,900
Get off my porch, you piece of shit.

1288
01:34:11,031 --> 01:34:12,742
How fucking dare you come?

1289
01:34:14,277 --> 01:34:16,260
Cock sucker!

1290
01:34:16,261 --> 01:34:17,447
Fucking boy!

1291
01:34:17,453 --> 01:34:18,439
Fucking ass!

1292
01:34:18,451 --> 01:34:19,261
Fucking sick!

1293
01:34:20,564 --> 01:34:23,592
You're a fucking asshole, Dicky.
I want you off my fucking porch.

1294
01:34:23,615 --> 01:34:27,513
Huh? Why don't you just fucking
come down here and talk to me, huh?

1295
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,459
You're such an asshole,
coming to my fucking house.

1296
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,654
- You piece of shit, standing on my porch!
- Sorry, sorry.

1297
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,260
It's not fucking ladylike to be shouting
in the street like this, all right?

1298
01:34:35,272 --> 01:34:37,972
- You're such a fucking cock sucker, coming over here.
- Please!

1299
01:34:37,984 --> 01:34:39,933
- Oh yeah? You think I fucking care?
- Come on. Just fucking...

1300
01:34:39,945 --> 01:34:42,233
Get off my fucking porch, Dicky.

1301
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:58,285
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a cocker spaniel?

1302
01:35:04,617 --> 01:35:06,237
All right,
I know you can't fucking stand me.

1303
01:35:06,249 --> 01:35:09,596
- Really, what makes you say that?
- I got news for you, all right?

1304
01:35:09,619 --> 01:35:11,346
My brother loves you,

1305
01:35:11,371 --> 01:35:13,778
and you can't just run away because of me.

1306
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:18,704
You don't deserve that, all right?
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1307
01:35:18,716 --> 01:35:21,106
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1308
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:23,324
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1309
01:35:23,348 --> 01:35:25,133
But I want you to
think about something.

1310
01:35:25,148 --> 01:35:28,237
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did,

1311
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,491
that in my time, I never had.

1312
01:35:30,515 --> 01:35:33,676
Oh... "Yeah, my big chance was with
Sugar Ray Leonard. I'm so great."

1313
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:36,999
"I'm the Pride of fucking Lowell.
Oh yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."

1314
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,678
- I've heard it.
- I came to make things right with you.

1315
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:41,647
Okay, let's make things right.
Number one:

1316
01:35:41,659 --> 01:35:43,925
You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1317
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:50,962
I was in the ring. Don't you think I know
what really fucking happened that day?

1318
01:35:50,977 --> 01:35:53,466
- What have you ever done with your life?
- I like my life.

1319
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:55,320
- Yeah? What have you ever done with it?
- I like my life now, Dicky.

1320
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:57,481
What have you ever done with your life?

1321
01:35:57,494 --> 01:36:01,275
You're a college dropout, Charlene.
You're just a little bar girl. Your life sucks.

1322
01:36:03,323 --> 01:36:04,385
All right.

1323
01:36:05,577 --> 01:36:08,724
I drink too much.
I worked in a lot of bars.

1324
01:36:08,743 --> 01:36:11,995
And I ruined a lot of opportunities,
but I'm trying to do better here.

1325
01:36:12,019 --> 01:36:14,026
- So is Micky.
- So am I.

1326
01:36:16,056 --> 01:36:20,424
And he needs me, you heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1327
01:36:24,019 --> 01:36:25,991
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1328
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,708
It's icing.

1329
01:36:32,191 --> 01:36:33,854
Okay.

1330
01:36:33,866 --> 01:36:36,531
I'll see you in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1331
01:36:36,555 --> 01:36:38,655
- It's a deal.
- All right, it's a deal.

1332
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:53,266
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1333
01:36:55,002 --> 01:36:58,137
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1334
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:00,944
I will.

1335
01:37:06,736 --> 01:37:07,881
Hey, Mick.

1336
01:37:10,172 --> 01:37:12,356
Do you think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1337
01:37:13,831 --> 01:37:16,743
You went ten rounds. One of the best
to do anything to hurt him.

1338
01:37:17,718 --> 01:37:18,951
You're my hero.

1339
01:37:20,178 --> 01:37:21,589
I was.

1340
01:37:23,544 --> 01:37:24,906
I was...

1341
01:37:30,349 --> 01:37:33,531
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

1342
01:38:52,098 --> 01:38:54,575
There's a press conference downstairs.

1343
01:38:54,576 --> 01:38:57,006
- Come on. Let's go.
- Guys...

1344
01:38:58,481 --> 01:39:02,520
Neary: Ten stone, six pounds.

1345
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:13,318
Ward: Ten stone, six pounds.

1346
01:39:14,648 --> 01:39:17,513
Hey, Micky. Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1347
01:39:19,309 --> 01:39:20,811
How have you been training?

1348
01:39:20,835 --> 01:39:24,310
- I train. I train hard.
- Shea's 22 in 0. Never been knocked down.

1349
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:26,224
Well that's going to change tomorrow.

1350
01:39:26,235 --> 01:39:28,424
In fact we expected a much better fighter.

1351
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:32,765
I'm just grateful to be here and have
the opportunity. Thank you, guys, for the shot.

1352
01:39:32,774 --> 01:39:35,381
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?

1353
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:38,126
And who would you like to fight next?

1354
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:40,772
I plan on moving
right through Micky Ward tomorrow,

1355
01:39:40,784 --> 01:39:43,508
moving on to other big fighters,
like Gatti.

1356
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,868
I believe Gatti and I would
make a great match.

1357
01:39:59,952 --> 01:40:03,240
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
twelve rounds of boxing

1358
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:09,651
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1359
01:40:56,147 --> 01:40:58,483
Don't listen to them, Mick.

1360
01:41:11,504 --> 01:41:14,968
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts entering the ring.

1361
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:17,939
It's his first fight outside the United States.

1362
01:41:17,953 --> 01:41:20,783
Micky Ward, 30 wins, 7 losses....

1363
01:41:20,806 --> 01:41:24,094
He's back and better, recently.
Twenty KOs.

1364
01:41:24,106 --> 01:41:28,678
And now Ward awaits his opponent,
Shea Neary.

1365
01:41:28,693 --> 01:41:33,476
Neary regards himself as
the European Arturo Gatti,

1366
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,764
meaning that he is a head-on
high-contact fighter

1367
01:41:36,776 --> 01:41:40,474
who throws seventy punches per round.

1368
01:41:40,492 --> 01:41:44,554
Neary is from Liverpool and should
have a huge following her tonight.

1369
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:50,763
Accompanied by "Paint the Town Red"
by the Mahones.

1370
01:41:50,782 --> 01:41:54,204
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1371
01:41:54,228 --> 01:42:00,188
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated. Lives a spartan existence.

1372
01:42:00,189 --> 01:42:05,495
And according to his promoters,
there's nothing but eat, drink, think,

1373
01:42:05,506 --> 01:42:09,369
fantasize and dream of fighting.

1374
01:42:09,393 --> 01:42:12,994
Shea Neary has had 22 professional fights
and won them all.

1375
01:42:12,995 --> 01:42:15,556
Seventeen KOs.

1376
01:42:25,289 --> 01:42:28,734
Start when you hear the bell.
Shake hands.

1377
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:32,323
Both of you. Shake hands.

1378
01:42:33,511 --> 01:42:39,263
As close as we just saw them in the middle
of the ring, forehead to forehead.

1379
01:42:39,264 --> 01:42:45,751
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1380
01:42:45,772 --> 01:42:49,799
Ward is a long ways from home.
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1381
01:42:49,822 --> 01:42:54,753
Well the big challenge for Ward is to get off
to a faster start than is customary for him.

1382
01:42:54,754 --> 01:42:58,303
Micky Ward a notoriously slow starter
in big fights.

1383
01:42:58,313 --> 01:43:00,802
Shea Neary an ultra-fast starter.

1384
01:43:00,817 --> 01:43:05,241
And that's the question that hovers
over round one. Get ready for the fight.

1385
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:08,254
Already Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes.

1386
01:43:08,278 --> 01:43:11,801
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1387
01:43:12,341 --> 01:43:15,288
- Whoa!
- Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1388
01:43:15,312 --> 01:43:19,433
- And a big uppercut by Neary.
- Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1389
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:23,067
Keeps opponents off balance,
jabbing here and there.

1390
01:43:25,398 --> 01:43:29,079
That was a good left hook by Neary
as he stepped in on Ward.

1391
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:33,939
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1392
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:36,627
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1393
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:40,090
My, is it tough for Micky Ward.

1394
01:43:40,108 --> 01:43:45,442
Neary digging his own right hand to the body.
They trade shots at close range.

1395
01:43:45,466 --> 01:43:48,309
Ward is trying to match Neary blow-for-blow,

1396
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:53,333
and now Neary starts to come on
and take the last thirty seconds to the round.

1397
01:43:53,346 --> 01:43:55,776
- How about that!
- Break!

1398
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:01,845
Tremendous barrage in the first minute.
Just look at this. Unbelievable.

1399
01:44:01,857 --> 01:44:04,350
What a great round one!

1400
01:44:04,374 --> 01:44:08,450
Ward is going to have to
pick up the tempo

1401
01:44:08,462 --> 01:44:10,352
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1402
01:44:10,358 --> 01:44:12,706
No doubt Neary is a better boxer.

1403
01:44:15,821 --> 01:44:20,929
Four hard right hands
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1404
01:44:20,939 --> 01:44:25,917
Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.
Surer of what he wants to do.

1405
01:44:25,928 --> 01:44:29,094
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1406
01:44:29,106 --> 01:44:32,172
Ward's going to have to step it up
a little bit more than he is right now.

1407
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:35,735
Micky Ward's corner taking
a really deep look at what's going on now,

1408
01:44:35,758 --> 01:44:38,964
and his family at ringside
well aware he's stepping up in class.

1409
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:42,764
Ward has to got to be more aggressive.

1410
01:44:42,774 --> 01:44:45,473
He can't just try to wait until
everything is perfect.

1411
01:44:45,485 --> 01:44:48,115
Despondence over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1412
01:44:48,129 --> 01:44:52,249
because his plan was the right one
and he's executing it.

1413
01:44:52,268 --> 01:44:59,536
Punches like these make it seem
that it's now Neary's fight.

1414
01:45:00,986 --> 01:45:06,282
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war
with as strong a fighter as Neary.

1415
01:45:07,767 --> 01:45:11,332
They are trying to hurt each other
with only punches.

1416
01:45:11,339 --> 01:45:16,107
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1417
01:45:16,118 --> 01:45:19,558
And Ward fumbled there
by a right cross from Neary.

1418
01:45:19,569 --> 01:45:25,951
- Ward hurting now, his legs are gone.
- Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky.

1419
01:45:26,766 --> 01:45:32,601
- Vicious body shots from Neary.
- And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.

1420
01:45:32,613 --> 01:45:37,580
I don't know if he can, Jeff.
He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.

1421
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:41,862
Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.

1422
01:45:43,568 --> 01:45:45,229
Come on, that's it!

1423
01:45:46,092 --> 01:45:47,830
That's my boy!

1424
01:45:47,835 --> 01:45:50,759
Forward! Forward!
Come on!

1425
01:45:52,278 --> 01:45:57,035
- Ward is out on his feet!
- Loser! Go back to America!

1426
01:45:57,046 --> 01:45:59,179
This could be it for Micky Ward.

1427
01:45:59,202 --> 01:46:01,855
Dicky, get him a fucking stool
Where's the stool?

1428
01:46:01,867 --> 01:46:04,523
Charlene, will you get the fuck
out of here with your high heels?

1429
01:46:05,442 --> 01:46:10,070
His brother's got Ward jumping
to wake up his legs.

1430
01:46:10,082 --> 01:46:13,556
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1431
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:18,400
It's Micky Ward against the aggressiveness
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1432
01:46:19,337 --> 01:46:22,730
If you don't have your defense up
you can really get hurt.

1433
01:46:22,754 --> 01:46:25,460
He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.

1434
01:46:25,472 --> 01:46:28,266
I don't think he's going to give it to him,
at this rate.

1435
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:30,309
This is a survival move.

1436
01:46:30,331 --> 01:46:34,053
Are you like me? Huh?
Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1437
01:46:34,077 --> 01:46:37,593
I never had to win, did I?
You've got to do more than that.

1438
01:46:37,616 --> 01:46:42,747
You've got to win a title.
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1439
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:45,248
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1440
01:46:45,272 --> 01:46:48,165
I had my time, and I blew it.
You don't have to, all right?

1441
01:46:48,234 --> 01:46:51,949
Now fucking get out there.
Bring that fucking anger.

1442
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,590
All the shit you've been through
over the fucking years,

1443
01:46:54,607 --> 01:46:57,235
put it in the ring right now.
This is yours. This is fucking yours.

1444
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:00,160
- Okay.
- Fucking head, body, head, body.

1445
01:47:00,184 --> 01:47:03,671
- Say it back to me.
- Head, body, head, body.

1446
01:47:03,689 --> 01:47:07,578
You can do it.
Stay off the fucking ropes.

1447
01:47:12,272 --> 01:47:14,538
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1448
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:18,107
I'm thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1449

Once again, Ward against the ropes
as Neary is free to attack.

1452
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,500
What are you doing?
Come on, Mick...

1453
01:47:32,118 --> 01:47:35,838
Sometimes if you want to win,
you've got to be something that you're not.

1454
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:39,511
Off the fucking rope, man!
That ain't it!

1456
01:47:44,866 --> 01:47:48,892
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time, Micky!

1457
01:47:48,894 --> 01:47:50,886
It's all for you!

01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:04,320
Ward nods as if to say "Come on!".

1462
01:48:04,321 --> 01:48:06,892
"Come on, let's fight!"

1463
01:48:06,913 --> 01:48:10,286
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1464
01:48:10,309 --> 01:48:12,904
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1465
01:48:12,916 --> 01:48:15,546
And a left hook to the body,
and an uppercut lands,

1466
01:48:15,557 --> 01:48:18,270

01:48:30,021 --> 01:48:33,643
that Shea Neary has gone down.

1471
01:48:33,651 --> 01:48:36,082
This is it! This is it, Micky!

1472
01:48:36,094 --> 01:48:41,312
23 seconds remain in this round
as Micky now wipes off Neary's gloves.

You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fucking champion of the world!

1480
01:49:29,256 --> 01:49:31,734
You fucking did it!

1481
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:47,514
My boy's the champion of the world!

1482
01:49:47,515 --> 01:49:49,580
I love you!

1483
01:50:19,754 --> 01:50:23,335
This town always said
you're a fucking boxer, right?

1484
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:25,724
You thought it's a piece of shit.

1485
01:50:25,736 --> 01:50:28,061
- He put Lowell back on the map, you know.
- We did.

1486
01:50:28,072 --> 01:50:31,102
- I tell you. No, hold on.
- We.

1487
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:34,254
Who used to be the Pride of Lowell?
Right here.

1488
01:50:34,256 --> 01:50:36,862
Who's the Pride of Lowell now?
Right there.

1489
01:50:36,863 --> 01:50:38,941
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1490
01:50:38,947 --> 01:50:42,082
Hand it down to him.
Nothing better than that.

1491
01:50:42,094 --> 01:50:44,357
Nothing better than that...

1492
01:50:44,358 --> 01:50:46,528
He did it.
I've got to go.

1493
01:50:46,552 --> 01:50:48,113
I've got to go.
