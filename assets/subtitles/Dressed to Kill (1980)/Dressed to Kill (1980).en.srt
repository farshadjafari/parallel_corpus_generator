2
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,023
Sports news coming up
at twenty-five after the hour.

3
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,735
Jack Walters will be having that
exclusive interview with Billy Martin,

4
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,196
and you know that could be fireworks.

5
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:43,365
The best bet for you folks
coming in from Jersey,

6
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,117
do whatever you got to do
to use the Holland

7
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,869
rather than the Lincoln Tunnel.

8
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,788
The backup there, at the Lincoln,
is already a nightmare.

9
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:55,002
Looking forward to some bright blue
skies all day today, with sunshine

10
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,713
and the highs this afternoon
somewhere in the upper 50s.

11
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,423
Especially in the city,
it could get up near 60.

12
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,009
Enjoy it while you can, my friend.

13
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:05,052
Old Man Winter is going to be blowing
on your neck any day now.

14
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,346
Lows tonight in the upper 30s

15
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:10,684
with frost in some of the usually
colder regions upstate.

16
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:14,187
You're listening to Willie Craig
on PRM-FM 93.

17
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,024
And if your clock radio
is set to go off at 7:18,

18
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,776
it should be doing that right about now.

19
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:23,612
Start every day with music on PRM.

20
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,658
This is a cut from the new Pandemonium
album, "Lady Stevie."

21
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:36,250
Peter, you're supposed to be ready
in half an hour.

22
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,543
Ready for what?

23
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:40,088
We're going to the museum today,
and then you and Mike and I...

24
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:43,425
Mom, I can't go. I need the rest
of the vacation to finish this thing.

25
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,634
We made these plans
a week ago, remember?

26
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:49,014
I know. But I'm way behind my schedule.
I'm sorry.

27
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,266
Peter, have you been up all night again?

28
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,478
Mom, the City Science Championships
are next week.

29
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,981
Turn that thing off.

30
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,942
Put that down and look at me.

31
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,785
We made a little deal, didn't we?

32
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,790
You know I'm very proud and excited
about your project,

33
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:17,417
but I don't want
you working all night on it.

34
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,877
I know. I'm sorry.

35
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,880
Mom, this is the most incredible thing
that I've ever built.

36
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,423
I mean, this carries.

37
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:27,009
It carries? Carries what?

38
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:30,889
Binary numbers.
It can hold up to a 20-digit figure.

39
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,060
Now wait a second. You said
it can carry, and it holds, too?

40
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,978
Both. It does both.
That's the whole point.

41
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,023
I mean, there isn't a circuit like this
in any of my books.

42
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,858
I've invented it.

43
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,110
Well, that's great.

44
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,822
That's great, Peter.

45
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:49,324
What are you going to call it?

46
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,492
I don't know.

47
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,076
Well, come on.

48
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,831
Everybody knows that when you invent
or discover something,

49
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:59,918
you get to name it, like... a napoleon.

50
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,838
- A what?
- You know, the French pastry.

51
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,588
It was named after Napoleon.

52
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,259
Napoleon invented pastry?
I thought he was a general.

53
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,011
Well, you can't fight battles
all the time.

54
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:13,014
He baked as a kind of relaxation.

55
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,976
Are you OK, Mom?

56
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,105
Listen. No more all-nighters, OK?

57
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,983
OK.

58
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,197
What is this called, anyway?

59
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,408
It's a peter, of course.

60
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,120
That is, if I ever get it finished.

61
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,913
OK, I'll let you skip it this time,

62
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,625
but only if you promise
not to work all night.

63
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,254
OK, I promise.

64
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,759
I promise. All right?

65
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,596
Grandma's going to be very disappointed.

66
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:58,268
But it's all right. I'll explain
that you're working on your peter.

67
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,440
There's someone at the front door. Yes.

68
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,067
Between 11:00 and 12:00,
Thursday, right?

69
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:50,110
OK, fine. Bye.

70
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,448
Kate, good to see you.

71
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,537
Mary is on vacation,
so I have to be my own receptionist.

72
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:00,663
How am I doing?

73
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,583
I hope you won't keep me waiting today.
I want to get to the museum early.

74
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:07,504
I have to be at lunch by 12:30
with Mike and his mother.

75
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,089
No waiting, go right in.

76
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,258
The doctor will be with you shortly.

77
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,644
So, what's happening?

78
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,317
My mother's driving me crazy as usual.

79
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,610
Did you talk to her?

80
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:36,991
She's hinting around
about surprising me for my birthday.

81
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,620
She's going to come up from Florida,
is she?

82
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,538
That's her surprise.

83
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,625
How do you feel about seeing her?

84
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,211
Well, I feel...

85
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,923
I should want to see her.

86
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,384
It's been six months
since we've been down there,

87
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,678
but... she'll just ruin my birthday.

88
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,806
And it's my day, not hers.

89
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,476
Well, now, think.
What are our options?

90
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:09,691
I could make up an excuse
and tell her not to come.

91
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,196
No, I can't do that.

92
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,908
And let's not forget,
it's supposed to be a surprise.

93
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,368
Anyway, it's not her.

94
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,870
It's just...

95
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,124
I don't feel up to it,
or her or anything.

96
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,376
How are things going with Mike?

97
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:31,462
- Fine.
- Good.

98
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:36,759
No, they're not fine.
What a dumb word that is.

99
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:42,724
He gave me one of his wham-bang
specials this morning,

100
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,600
and I'm mad at him.

101
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,686
Isn't that right? Shouldn't I be mad?

102
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,440
Yeah. Did you tell him?

103
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,360
- What?
- That you were mad at him.

104
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,154
Of course not.

105
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,826
I moaned with pleasure at his touch.

106
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,162
Isn't that what every man wants?

107
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,288
I don't know. Is it?

108
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,582
Don't start that stuff with me.

109
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,419
Don't you think you'd feel better
if you snapped at Mike instead of me?

110
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,258
Think about where your anger is going.

111
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,264
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:27,143
Stop apologizing
and tell Mike he makes you mad.

113
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,897
Tell him he stinks in bed?

114
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,524
Does he?

115
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,486
- Yes.
- Then tell him.

116
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,744
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

117
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,163
There's nothing wrong with you.

118
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,624
Do you find me attractive?

119
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,292
Of course.

120
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,044
Would you want to sleep with me?

121
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,297
Yes.

122
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,341
Then why don't you?

123
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,224
Because I love my wife,

124
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,018
and sleeping with you isn't worth
jeopardizing my marriage.

125
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,022
Is it worth it to you
to jeopardize yours?

126
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,649
I don't know.

127
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,172
Come on, look at the pictures.

128
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,201
This is so boring. Come on.

129
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:10,746
Look at the pictures.
That's what we came here for.

130
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,211
Hi.

131
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,841
First time here?

132
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,639
Stop it.

133
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,687
Cut it out.

134
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,011
Mommy.

135
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:11,640
Mommy.

136
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:16,187
Now you stop that. I told you
to stand and be still and I meant it.

137
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,752
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been
so rude. Thank you for picking up...

138
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,375
Hello?

139
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,088
Who is this?

140
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:44,294
It's not polite to stare.

141
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,702
No.

142
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,997
No.

143
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,875
No. No.

144
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:13,382
So you really think Auditron's going up?

145
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,594
Well, I got it from a very good source.

146
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,898
- Double?
- You didn't hear it from me.

147
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:46,416
You know what? I'm going to give
my broker a little call.

148
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:49,168
- Jesus.
- Well, what about...?

149
00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:01,056
Oh, my...

150
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,650
No, wait! Help!

151
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:57,778
Please, you don't understand!
Please, call the police! Wait!

152
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:02,659
Please, call the police!

153
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:26,932
Call the police!
Somebody call the police!

154
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:01,717
Dr. Elliott, this is Lou Freeman.
I'm still in Chicago.

155
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:05,054
I won't be back in time
for our appointment on Friday.

156
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,514
I'll give you a call on Monday, OK?

157
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:15,648
Robert, call George.
I'll be home over the weekend.

158
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,989
This is Bobbi.

159
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,036
You won't see me anymore,

160
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,871
so I'm going to have a little session
with your machine.

161
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,418
Doctor, I'm so unhappy.

162
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:38,505
I'm a girl inside this man's body,

163
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:41,132
and you're not helping me to get out.

164
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,467
So I got a new shrink.

165
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,512
Levy's his name,
and he's going to sign the papers

166
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,847
so I can get my operation.

167
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,518
I borrowed your razor and...

168
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,023
Well, you'll read all about it.

169
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,860
Some blonde bitch saw me,
but I'll get her.

170
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:08,242
Remember, if he calls you...

171
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:11,621
you better tell Levy I'm OK.

172
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:16,876
Don't make me be a bad girl again.

173
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,717
Yes, Dr. Elliott,
this is Mrs. Peters.

174
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:29,972
I just wanted to confirm our appointment
for tomorrow. Two o'clock, right?

175
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,608
This is Detective Marino
from the 13th Precinct.

176
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,405
One of your patients, Kate Miller,
was killed tonight.

177
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,867
I wonder if you'd stop down
at the precinct and ask for me.

178
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,411
I got some questions
I think you can help me with.

179
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,889
Are you sure?

180
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,684
OK.

181
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,858
Positive ID.

182
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,242
Hey, Eddie. Listen, I want
you to take this over to the lab

183
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,579
- and get some pictures made of it.
- Yeah.

184
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,414
- Keep an eye on her.
- Right.

185
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,916
- Detective Marino?
- OK.

186
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,876
- Yeah.
- I'm Dr. Elliott.

187
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,086
Oh, Doctor.

188
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,465
Listen, would you have a seat outside
my office in the corner over there.

189
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,550
- I'll be right with you.
- All right.

190
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,512
So give me three copies...

191
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,807
Why don't you let go of me, will you?

192
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:16,996
Are you Kate Miller's son?

193
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,961
I'm Dr. Elliott, your mother's doctor.

194
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,221
Why do you have to be here?

195
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:36,474
I made Mike bring me.

196
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:38,768
He's identifying the...

197
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,481
My mom wouldn't be dead
if I had gone with her.

198
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,193
You shouldn't feel responsible
for your mother's death.

199
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,155
If you talk about it,
I might be able to help.

200
00:40:51,322 --> 00:40:52,699
Do you know who killed her?

201
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,867
- No.
- Then you can't help, can you?

202
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:56,577
Not now maybe.

203
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:01,623
But later, if you want someone
to talk to about all this.

204
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,710
- Ask your father to call...
- No, he's not my father.

205
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,880
My father was killed in Vietnam.

206
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,222
Take this.

207
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:19,934
You can call me any time.

208
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,478
I'm always there all day long.
I'm usually there...

209
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,355
OK, Doctor, let's talk in here.

210
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,108
Call me.

211
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,456
She was picked up by Lockman
at the museum.

212
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,083
She spent the afternoon at his place

213
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:28,293
and was chopped up in the elevator
on the way out.

214
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:30,003
That girl out there saw the murderer.

215
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:33,632
That's terrible.

216
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,469
- Do you know who it is?
- Some broad.

217
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,554
- A woman?
- Yeah.

218
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,974
Miss Blake didn't get
a great look at her face

219
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,268
because she had on these big sunglasses.

220
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:44,768
Is there anything I can do to help?

221
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,523
Yeah. When you spoke with Mrs. Miller...

222
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:51,400
did she say
she was going to meet anybody?

223
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,818
No.

224
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,987
Did she leave your office
with anybody?

225
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,322
No.

226
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,157
What was she seeing you for?

227
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:00,827
Nothing too serious. She had
some problems with her marriage,

228
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:02,786
and I was helping her work them out.

229
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:04,289
What kind of problems?

230
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,833
Are you married, Detective Marino?

231
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:11,045
- Yeah.
- Children?

232
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,170
Two sons.

233
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,840
When was the last time
you had intercourse with your wife?

234
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:19,846
Now what the fuck is it to you?

235
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,432
That's exactly how I feel about
your questions concerning Mrs. Miller.

236
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,606
Hey, look, Doctor,

237
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:33,860
we got a brutally murdered woman here,

238
00:43:34,027 --> 00:43:37,070
who passed the point
of being embarrassed

239
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,324
by anything you might tell me.

240
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:44,996
I guess you're right.
I'm sorry,

241
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,789
but I'm not used to discussing
a patient's case with outsiders.

242
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,376
I'm not an outsider. I'm a cop.

243
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:53,713
Now, let's make it easy for you.

244
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,632
Was she looking to get killed?

245
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:57,382
- You mean, was she suicidal?
- Yeah.

246
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,550
- No.
- No.

247
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,219
So why did she pick up
this Lockman character?

248
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:02,972
- He could've been a killer.
- But he wasn't.

249
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:06,684
Yeah, but the next guy might have been.
You know, if at first you don't succeed.

250
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:08,186
Do you think she wanted to get killed?

251
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:09,896
Don't you? Look.

252
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:13,690
We got some hot-pants broad
cruising around for some action.

253
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:17,737
The guy she picked up went down on her
in a cab, for Christ's sake.

254
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,990
I got a blow-by-blow description
from the cabby.

255
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:24,077
After she finishes with him,

256
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,954
she comes on to some weirdo
in the elevator?

257
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:30,248
Hey. There's all kinds of ways
to get killed in this city,

258
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:32,168
if you're looking for it.

259
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,340
Well... Yes, she did have a problem
about her sexual worth.

260
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,596
And this morning she asked me
if I was attracted to her.

261
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,681
Yeah, but you're not a psycho.

262
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,518
You do know something, though,
don't you, Doc?

263
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:52,646
Yes, of course.
I do some work at Bellevue.

264
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,025
Could she have met one of these nuts
at your office?

265
00:44:57,193 --> 00:45:00,445
I mean, some kind of weirdo she could've
turned on that might have followed her?

266
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,702
The term we use, Detective Marino,
is not "weirdo,"

267
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,621
but a person
suffering from emotional dysfunction

268
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,289
and a problem of maladaption.

269
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,041
And they never come to my office.

270
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,380
Are you sure?

271
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,092
How about a new patient?

272
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,639
I mean, how do you know
how nuts they are until you see them?

273
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:28,807
That's possible,
but it's hardly likely...

274
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,143
Doctor.

275
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,396
You're not protecting
one of your patients now, are you?

276
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,190
Absolutely not.

277
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,155
Well, Doc,
you've got to look at it my way.

278
00:45:43,322 --> 00:45:46,701
See, we got no leads,
except a witness out there

279
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,579
who maybe should take a look
at all your patients

280
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,164
that were around that morning.

281
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,125
And that way, I can be absolutely sure

282
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,836
that my weirdo isn't your

283
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,007
"person suffering
from emotional dysfunctions

284
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,385
and problems of maladaption."

285
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:09,974
Peter, come on, let's go home.

286
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:11,266
Excuse me.

287
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:41,005
OK, Doctor.

288
00:46:41,172 --> 00:46:44,884
I'm sorry you're not more cooperative,
which means that

289
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,429
I'm just going to have to waste some
time in getting a court order

290
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,264
to check out your appointment book.

291
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:51,431
I'm sorry, too.

292
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,684
But I feel I must protect
the confidentiality of my patients.

293
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:59,731
Of course, we're just two professionals
doing our job.

294
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,318
It's too bad we can't work together.
Come on.

295
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,114
Thank you very much for your help.
I'll be in touch.

296
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:16,164
Yes, thank you for waiting.
This is the answering service.

297
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,668
- Would you care to leave a message?
- Yes, I would.

298
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,003
- This is Dr. Elliott.
- How do you spell that?

299
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,797
E-L-L-I-O-T-T.

300
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:25,423
What is the message?

301
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,344
Would you please say
that I would very much like to see her,

302
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,179
and could she call me at my office.

303
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,266
So, Miss Blake.

304
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:38,396
Are you still living
at 93 Nassau Street?

305
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:39,981
That's right.

306
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,775
Tell me, how did you happen to be
in that building

307
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,777
that Mrs. Miller was killed in?

308
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:47,237
I was visiting a friend.

309
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:49,282
And who was that?

310
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:53,202
Well... it's sort of embarrassing.

311
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:55,663
I'd really rather not say.

312
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,998
Why?

313
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,626
He's married.

314
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:05,840
What kind of building is this?
Everybody's getting laid after lunch.

315
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,762
I didn't say I was "getting laid,"
to use your expression.

316
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:16,391
What's the matter?

317
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,936
- I'm a little crude for you?
- That's right.

318
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,820
Look, Miss Blake, let's cut this shit.
I got all the dope on you right here.

319
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,072
Does this look familiar? Let me see.

320
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,742
March 5th. Charge: disorderly conduct,

321
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,536
solicitation
for the purpose of prostitution.

322
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:40,791
Arresting Officer: Duram.
Apprehended at the Park Avenue Hotel.

323
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,210
Classy arrest.

324
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,880
- Thank you.
- Let's face it, you're a whore.

325
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:48,673
A Park Avenue whore,
but you're still a whore.

326
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,427
Now, who were you fucking?

327
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:56,139
Fuck you.

328
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:58,224
No, fuck you.

329
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,644
You're no witness.
You're a suspect.

330
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:02,271
What are you talking about?

331
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:04,690
We got a murder weapon
with your prints on it.

332
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,817
That's bullshit.
Why would I want to kill her?

333
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,527
You were there with the razor.
You tell me.

334
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,862
I told you. There was a blonde woman
in the elevator...

335
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,697
Yeah, except nobody else saw
this blonde woman

336
00:49:12,865 --> 00:49:14,449
enter or leave the building.

337
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,661
You didn't notice
if she had wings, did you?

338
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,206
She was in the elevator. I saw her.

339
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:22,333
So, what were you doing there?

340
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,210
- I had a job.
- Who?

341
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,710
You want me to get in trouble,
don't you?

342
00:49:25,878 --> 00:49:28,047
- You are in trouble.
- Hey, I didn't kill her.

343
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,048
So who were you fucking?

344
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,052
Ted, I didn't get his last name.
He's from out of town.

345
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,887
Well, that's great.
Yeah, Ted from out of town.

346
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,724
That's almost as good
as the blonde from the elevator.

347
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,559
It's true.
He was standing right behind me.

348
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,063
He saw the elevator doors open
and that...

349
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,233
woman inside all cut up and bleeding.

350
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,902
I know all about Mrs. Miller.
We got her downstairs.

351
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,028
But what about this blonde?
Did he see her, too?

352
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,572
I don't know.

353
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,246
Well, look, Miss... Miss Blake.

354
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:05,208
You're going to save me a lot of trouble
by finding this Ted from out of town

355
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:08,003
and getting him in town
and downtown and in here

356
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,798
to sign this statement as to exactly
what he saw and when he saw it.

357
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,260
How the hell am I supposed to know
where he is?

358
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:16,594
Well, if you can't find him,
I sure can't.

359
00:50:16,762 --> 00:50:20,974
And anyway, you got a lot better
motivation than I do: your ass.

360
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,894
Now, get the hell out of here.

361
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,313
I'm giving you 48 hours.

362
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:30,775
And don't try to blow town.
I'll be keeping tabs on you.

363
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,903
Norma? Liz.

364
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,907
Where the hell have you been?
I've been trying to get you all day.

365
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,329
Ted was terrific.

366
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,208
That's why I'm calling.
I'd like to see him again.

367
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,251
When's he coming back?

368
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,547
Two weeks?

369
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:53,882
That's no good.

370
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,927
Do you have a number for him?
I'd like to give him a call.

371
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:02,724
What do you mean, your escort service
doesn't give out numbers?

372
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,351
I want to talk to him.

373
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,981
Trouble? No, I'm not in any trouble.
I just want to talk to the guy.

374
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:13,652
OK.

375
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,362
OK, thanks!

376
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,947
Thanks for nothing.

377
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,884
You're just never in.

378
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,139
I've been out myself,
running down that nosy bitch.

379
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,771
I found out where she lives,

380
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,775
so I'm just going to wait right here
until she shows her face.

381
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:08,280
And then I'm going to cut
those spying eyes out.

382
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,284
What were you calling me about, anyway?

383
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:17,456
It wouldn't be about that murder
I read about in the papers.

384
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:21,293
Hell of a way to lose a patient.
But you shouldn't try to fuck them, Doc.

385
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,003
Hi, Max. It's Liz.

386
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:27,090
Look, I want to buy 60 shares
of Auditron. What does it sell for?

387
00:56:27,257 --> 00:56:29,300
I'm glad I took care
of that cock-teaser.

388
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,637
$15.60 a share?

389
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,639
You would've done
the same thing yourself.

390
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:38,601
That's $936... Hold it a minute, Max.

391
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,980
I guess that's why I used your razor.

392
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,358
- Hello.
- But don't worry about it, Doc.

393
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:46,318
- Hi, Norma.
- Just call the police...

394
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:48,987
- I'm sorry about yesterday.
- ...lost-and-found department.

395
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,447
Yes, I know, I was a bad girl.

396
00:56:51,615 --> 00:56:53,574
Remember, if Levy calls...

397
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:54,659
Tonight?

398
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:57,454
- ...tell him I'm OK.
- No, I really can't.

399
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,833
Norma, hold on just a minute.
I'm talking to my mother.

400
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,001
- Max, when do you need money?
- That's funny.

401
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,713
- No, I don't want to sell anything.
- Isn't it?

402
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,005
Hold it, Max.

403
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,177
Norma, do you think this guy
might go for $500?

404
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,306
Great.

405
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,851
Hold on just a minute.
I'm going to say goodbye to my mother.

406
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,855
OK, Max, I got the money.
I'll have it for you tomorrow.

407
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:24,523
OK. OK.

408
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,693
Hi, Norma.

409
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,947
Do you think you could put together
a coffee break and a hot lunch,

410
00:57:32,114 --> 00:57:34,032
for tomorrow?

411
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,411
Yeah, I need $1, 000
for my mother's operation.

412
00:57:38,996 --> 00:57:41,748
No, it's nothing serious.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

413
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,878
- Great. Now, what time tonight?
- It's been three

414
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,713
to four years since your surgery.

415
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,048
- 8:30. Where?
- I want to show a picture, prior to...

416
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,552
- OK, anything special?
- Where'd you find that?

417
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:57,014
Actually we stole it from
People magazine, which has an article.

418
00:57:57,181 --> 00:57:59,349
Thank God straight fucks
are still in style.

419
00:57:59,516 --> 00:58:01,309
This is Nancy Hart, the transsexual.

420
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,103
- Just in from Cleveland.
- Isn't that something?

421
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:06,273
- I'll be there.
- You were a war correspondent?

422
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,608
Among other things.

423
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:11,737
And a foreign correspondent
in the Middle East. And...

424
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:16,867
I did a lot of police reporting,
and I dove on Spanish treasure wrecks.

425
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:18,494
You did a lot
of macho things, then?

426
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,704
This is very common among transsexuals.
You find...

427
00:58:23,248 --> 00:58:26,418
When I speak of transsexuals,
I tend to speak of male to female

428
00:58:26,585 --> 00:58:29,420
because there are a whole lot of more
of them than going the other way.

429
00:58:29,588 --> 00:58:33,592
And an awful lot of them
have real macho backgrounds.

430
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,764
I know a police captain, a West Pointer,
a couple of fighter pilots.

431
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,934
They all, you know,
most of them tried real hard.

432
00:58:43,101 --> 00:58:44,561
You were married twice?

433
00:58:44,728 --> 00:58:46,938
You are also the father
of three children.

434
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,858
So, you enjoyed a...

435
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:54,862
I don't want to say normal, I guess
that's a prejudicial way to put it,

436
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,784
but you enjoyed the traditional role
of father.

437
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,244
You fathered three children,

438
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:05,498
and you have engaged in
at least two heterosexual relationships.

439
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,293
More than that.
I've always been a devout heterosexual.

440
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:24,016
Cleveland?

441
00:59:24,184 --> 00:59:25,226
Excuse me?

442
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:28,021
Room 331,
you're the guy from Cleveland, right?

443
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,648
Three-thirty-one. I'm from Cleveland.

444
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:34,443
Well, hi.
I'm Liz from the escort service.

445
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,697
You're kidding?

446
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:41,326
- It's me.
- Well, hi.

447
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,119
Yeah, I'm glad to meet you.

448
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:47,291
Well, are you going to pump me dry here
or invite me in?

449
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,085
I'm sorry, come in.
You know, could I get you anything...?

450
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,405
93 Nassau Street.

451
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,826
Well, come on, let's go.

452
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,800
Look, forget that address
I just gave you.

453
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,094
Drop me at Columbus Circle.

454
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:46,516
Could you help me out?
Someone's following me.

455
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:52,021
This is Dr. Elliott again.
Did Bobbi pick up my messages yet?

456
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:54,815
- Yes, she has.
- She did?

457
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:56,943
- Yes, she did.
- When?

458
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,945
I'm sorry. I wouldn't know.

459
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,909
Could you give her
another message, please?

460
01:01:05,077 --> 01:01:06,911
- Yes. Go ahead.
- Yeah.

461
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:09,581
It is urgent that I see her.

462
01:01:10,248 --> 01:01:12,958
I will be in my office all tonight

463
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:14,835
and after 5:00 tomorrow.

464
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,807
What's the going rate on running lights?

465
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:40,027
Did I lose her?

466
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,614
You're doing swell, just swell.

467
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,829
But she's still coming.

468
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,967
Look, I didn't deliver, so why don't you
let me take you to dinner instead?

469
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,594
- All right, you got a date.
- OK.

470
01:02:05,762 --> 01:02:08,264
- Look, I gotta go.
- OK. Listen, I'll give you a call.

471
01:02:08,432 --> 01:02:10,099
Yeah, call me.

472
01:02:27,284 --> 01:02:29,034
Excuse me.

473
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:47,804
Get out of the way!

474
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,434
It's a free country!
He nearly clipped me!

475
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:14,099
Keeps pushing me.
Do you know her?

476
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,606
Hey, lady, what you looking for?

477
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:24,358
A train.
They still stop here, don't they?

478
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,945
Yeah, they stop here.
They stop down there, too.

479
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,284
Am I bothering you?

480
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,911
- No, you ain't bothering me.
- Good.

481
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,873
But you're bothering me.

482
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:39,081
She's bothering you, Sonny?

483
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,835
Yeah, that's right,
this bitch is bothering me.

484
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,297
- What are you going to do about it?
- I'm going to break her fucking ass.

485
01:04:45,463 --> 01:04:47,882
Hey, why break it
when we can fuck it first?

486
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,134
Hey, lady, where you going?

487
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,719
I don't want to crowd you guys.

488
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,887
Why are you down here
if you didn't want to crowd us?

489
01:04:53,054 --> 01:04:54,306
Give me a break.

490
01:04:54,472 --> 01:04:57,141
Hey, man, don't let her get away!
Get after her!

491
01:04:57,309 --> 01:05:00,478
Come on, man.
Come on, catch her, man.

492
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,731
Shit! Get out of the way!

493
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,614
Take it easy, lady,
this ain't the rush hour.

494
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,824
Where the fuck are you guys
when somebody needs you?

495
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,074
I was almost attacked.

496
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:17,411
- When?
- Right here, now, by those punks.

497
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,509
I don't see nothing.

498
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,219
Well, they were right here.

499
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,304
I thought you said you were attacked...

500
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:45,023
There are, but there's this blonde
that's been following...

501
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,193
Oh, forget it.

502
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:12,461
Let's get the fuck out of here!

503
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,068
The blonde must be
one of Elliott's patients.

504
01:08:35,235 --> 01:08:37,569
I was unloading my camera
when I saw her come out of his office

505
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:38,822
and I followed her to you.

506
01:08:38,988 --> 01:08:40,614
What was that stuff you sprayed on her?

507
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,117
It's a kind of Mace I made at home.

508
01:08:42,283 --> 01:08:44,243
It's a pretty simple compound
of sodium...

509
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:48,122
Save the Mr. Wizard lecture,
I wouldn't know sodium from Adam.

510
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,416
It sure worked.

511
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,002
It's temporary blindness.
It only lasts about ten seconds.

512
01:08:58,007 --> 01:08:59,926
Saved my life.

513
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,386
I know.

514
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,887
I wish I had saved Mom's.

515
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,101
You liked your mom a lot, didn't you?

516
01:09:11,855 --> 01:09:13,398
Yeah.

517
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,775
I miss her.

518
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,367
You want some more Coke?

519
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,494
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

520
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,747
How do you like my painting?

521
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:37,087
It's... very nice.

522
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,425
I bought it a couple of years ago
for $500.

523
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:43,595
It's really a great investment.

524
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:47,974
I mean, ten years from now,
it could be worth... a million dollars.

525
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,395
More if the artist dies, of course.

526
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,525
- Good luck with it.
- Thanks.

527
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:01,779
Doesn't your father wonder
where you are?

528
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:04,114
He's not my father. He's my stepfather.

529
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,452
I told him I am staying at my friend
Paul's, and he'll cover for me.

530
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:09,328
I'll take you home tomorrow.

531
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:12,122
I don't want to go home.
Miss Blake, I've got some pictures...

532
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,248
Call me Liz, OK?

533
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,460
Liz, I've got some pictures
of that blonde

534
01:10:15,627 --> 01:10:17,462
from a camera I hid
outside Elliott's office.

535
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:21,298
Now, we gotta get in, get Elliott's
appointment book, and get her name.

536
01:10:21,466 --> 01:10:24,719
That's what the police are for.
Come on, let's talk to Marino.

537
01:10:24,886 --> 01:10:27,387
Fine, you talk to Marino.
I'm going to find out the blonde's name.

538
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,935
Who do you think you are, Superman?
You're just a kid, for God's sake.

539
01:10:32,101 --> 01:10:34,479
Yeah, I'm the kid that saved your life.

540
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:43,820
All right, look,
let me talk to Marino.

541
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:47,408
If he cops out, then I'll help you.

542
01:10:50,828 --> 01:10:54,289
OK, but you can't mention my name.

543
01:10:54,457 --> 01:10:55,875
Mike would kill me.

544
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:59,878
I'm supposed to be...
studying for a French exam.

545
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,841
Well, your friend's covering
for you tonight, right?

546
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,764
Well, I'm your friend, too,
and I'll be the best cover you ever had.

547
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:12,557
OK.

548
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,645
You sure you going to be OK here?

549
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:16,854
Fine.

550
01:11:17,814 --> 01:11:20,483
Well... Here you go.

551
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,278
- Good night.
- Good night.

552
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,617
Hey, Marino, I gotta talk to you.

553
01:11:29,784 --> 01:11:31,118
- Mr. Out-of-Town turn up?
- No.

554
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,996
Then you better send
for your overnight bags.

555
01:11:33,162 --> 01:11:35,539
Hey, come on,
you know I didn't kill that woman.

556
01:11:35,707 --> 01:11:36,957
You're still my best bet.

557
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,462
For your information,
she tried to kill me last night.

558
01:11:42,213 --> 01:11:43,797
Really?

559
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,175
Is that supposed to be concern
in your voice?

560
01:11:46,342 --> 01:11:49,970
I take a professional interest
in our citizens knocking each other off.

561
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,222
Where did this happen?

562
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:54,225
She followed me from the Sheraton
into the subway.

563
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,685
I thought I lost her,
but she was waiting when I got home.

564
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,813
- She tried to slash me.
- Any witnesses to this one?

565
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,023
- Yes.
- Who?

566
01:12:03,735 --> 01:12:06,695
- I can't tell you.
- Out of town again?

567
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,323
No, I just promised
I wouldn't say anything.

568
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,493
You know, this has
a familiar ring to it.

569
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,246
Look, Marino, I'm not interested
in your wiseass remarks.

570
01:12:15,413 --> 01:12:16,997
Someone's trying to kill me,
and I need help.

571
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,958
I'll help you. I got a nice cell.
You'll be very safe in it.

572
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,252
Hey, Eddie.

573
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,670
Hey, wait a minute. Look.

574
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:25,256
I know the murderer is
one of Elliott's patients.

575
01:12:25,423 --> 01:12:27,591
- How do you know that?
- Because she came out of his office.

576
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,385
Did you see her?

577
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,805
Well, no, not exactly.
But I know she came out.

578
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:36,016
You got to get in there,
get his appointment book.

579
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,310
Her name's got to be in it.

580
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,270
I hope you make a better hooker
than you do a detective.

581
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:43,774
I thought about Elliott's appointment
book a long time ago.

582
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,068
- So?
- So...

583
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:48,945
You can't just walk into some shrink's
joint and start going through his books.

584
01:12:49,113 --> 01:12:51,740
You need a search warrant.
And judges take a long time

585
01:12:51,908 --> 01:12:54,702
before they let you start snooping
around some shrink's office.

586
01:12:56,788 --> 01:13:01,458
Of course, that wouldn't prevent
a paranoid murder suspect

587
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,795
from breaking in.

588
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,507
You know, searching for some evidence
to defend her case.

589
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:11,301
Oh, I get it.
You want me to break in for you.

590
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,139
I don't want you to do anything illegal.
You can quote me on that.

591
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:20,228
But I'm booking you tomorrow.
You got it? Tomorrow.

592
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:43,708
I'm Dr. Levy.

593
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,877
How do you do? I'm Dr. Elliott.

594
01:13:48,172 --> 01:13:50,507
What can I do for you, Dr. Elliott?

595
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,469
You're seeing a patient of mine.

596
01:13:53,636 --> 01:13:54,929
That's right.

597
01:13:55,096 --> 01:13:56,555
I believe she's dangerous.

598
01:13:56,722 --> 01:13:58,640
Really? In what way?

599
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,685
She's causing me trouble
because I wouldn't approve

600
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,060
her sex-change operation.

601
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:04,771
What kind of trouble has she caused you?

602
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:07,567
She's threatened me several times
over the phone.

603
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:11,529
- She also stole my razor.
- Why would she do that?

604
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,365
Doctor, did you read about the woman
who was slashed to death in an elevator?

605
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:17,326
It was on the front page,
I could hardly miss...

606
01:14:17,493 --> 01:14:19,871
Kate Miller, the victim, was my patient.

607
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,541
You don't think that Bobbi
had anything to do with that?

608
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:27,043
My razor's gone.
Kate Miller was killed with a razor.

609
01:14:28,212 --> 01:14:29,671
Nobody else could have taken it?

610
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,467
Doctor, I am not paranoid.
Bobbi has threatened me over the phone.

611
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,219
She said she was going to hurt me.

612
01:14:35,386 --> 01:14:38,055
My patient was slashed to death,
and my razor's gone.

613
01:14:38,222 --> 01:14:41,559
Now you don't have to be a detective
to figure it out, do you?

614
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:46,146
Come with me, and...
we'll talk to the police.

615
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:47,773
I've already been to the police.

616
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,777
But I didn't tell them about Bobbi.
I wanted to talk to her first.

617
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:54,572
I wanted to be absolutely sure
that it was her.

618
01:14:54,739 --> 01:14:57,073
But she wouldn't return my calls.

619
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,243
I was hoping you'd be able to help.

620
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,703
Yes, I'll help.

621
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:03,997
I'll talk to her.

622
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,083
If I agree with your diagnosis,
we'll go to the police.

623
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,336
Thank you.

624
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:10,796
Please let me know what happens.

625
01:15:10,963 --> 01:15:13,256
Do you know why Bobbi came to see me
in the first place?

626
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,091
No.

627
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:23,391
Why don't we go to my office,
and we'll try to get in touch with her.

628
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,020
I am late for an appointment now.

629
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:29,023
Why don't you call me at my office
when you've reached her.

630
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,274
All right.

631
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,652
You sure you'll be at your office?

632
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,237
Yes, I'm sure.

633
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:36,613
I'll call you there.

634
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:50,127
Peter Miller, I left some Super-8 film.

635
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,087
There's four dollars there.

636
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,144
I timed Elliott's patients
coming out of his office,

637
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:08,645
and the fastest was eight seconds.

638
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,605
So I set my camera to go off
every four seconds

639
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,275
so I'd be sure to get a good shot
of everybody.

640
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:31,085
- That's her.
- She must be his last appointment.

641
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:33,170
We got to get a look in that book.

642
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:37,675
Yeah, I know. Marino wants it, too.
Only, I can get it for him faster.

643
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:41,177
No legal red tape, just my ass.

644
01:16:41,345 --> 01:16:45,056
Look, I'll get it, nobody cares about
my ass. I'm just a grief-struck kid.

645
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,560
Yeah, but what a kid.

646
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,939
Okay, I got an idea.

647
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,862
It was very nice of you to see...

648
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:04,201
It was nice of you to see me so soon.

649
01:17:05,328 --> 01:17:07,912
I try to keep my nights open
for returning phone calls

650
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,625
or in case a patient
needs some extra help.

651
01:17:12,543 --> 01:17:13,918
I was worried about you.

652
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,506
You've had a terrible experience.

653
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:20,842
I know.

654
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:23,095
I didn't realize...

655
01:17:23,262 --> 01:17:26,181
But I've been having
these terrible nightmares.

656
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,854
What were they about?

657
01:17:34,231 --> 01:17:35,483
Well...

658
01:17:37,234 --> 01:17:39,028
I have to get a cigarette.

659
01:17:41,155 --> 01:17:44,658
I'm in this house that I've never
been to before, visiting a friend.

660
01:17:49,538 --> 01:17:50,622
He's not there.

661
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:57,171
I'm watching TV...
and the doorbell rings.

662
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,382
It's a man.

663
01:18:01,592 --> 01:18:04,261
He's big, dark.

664
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:10,266
He says his car broke down,
and he needs to use the phone.

665
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,104
I believe him and let him in...

666
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,525
although I know something's wrong.

667
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:26,783
He closes the door, locks it,
and takes out a razor.

668
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,247
He says he's not going to hurt me.

669
01:18:36,293 --> 01:18:40,506
Then he tells me...
what he's going to do to me...

670
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,219
and how much I'm going to like it.

671
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,889
All the time he's talking,

672
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:51,809
I can see the bulge in his pants.

673
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:55,938
He orders me to strip.

674
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,484
I do it,
keeping one eye on the razor.

675
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,363
He drops his pants...

676
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:10,286
forces me down, on my stomach.

677
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:15,373
He spreads my legs,
kneels down behind me...

678
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,170
and rests the cold blade.

679
01:19:33,476 --> 01:19:34,726
Forcing it.

680
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,273
I'm sorry.

681
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,777
What's the matter?

682
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,694
It's just so dirty.

683
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,198
Why do you say that?

684
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:50,658
Look, I know what dirty is,
and this is dirty.

685
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,082
Well, why don't you just talk about it?

686
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,377
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.

687
01:20:01,712 --> 01:20:03,046
It's very bad.

688
01:20:04,256 --> 01:20:06,509
And you're talking to an expert on bad.

689
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:07,717
Oh, really?

690
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:10,887
Now what makes you such an expert?

691
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,431
Because I'm a hooker.

692
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:20,271
And I have done most of the bad things
you just read about.

693
01:20:21,065 --> 01:20:23,067
Do you like doing these things?

694
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:25,860
- Sometimes.
- What do you like about it?

695
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:28,823
I like to turn men on.

696
01:20:30,783 --> 01:20:33,409
I must do a pretty good job
because they pay me a lot.

697
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,912
Do you ever have any sex
that's not paid for?

698
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,626
Is that a proposal?

699
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,337
No. It...

700
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:47,591
It's what we psychiatrists call
a question.

701
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:50,469
Yes.

702
01:20:50,636 --> 01:20:51,804
"Yes" what?

703
01:20:51,971 --> 01:20:55,015
Yes, I do. For men that turn me on.

704
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,226
What sort of men turn you on?

705
01:21:01,605 --> 01:21:03,983
Mature, doctorly type.

706
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,569
Like you.

707
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,364
Are you sexually attracted to me?

708
01:21:12,408 --> 01:21:14,451
Yes. Are you?

709
01:21:14,618 --> 01:21:16,578
Attracted to you?

710
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,789
Yes.

711
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:24,168
But then,
this isn't a social visit, is it?

712
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:27,965
You've come here for help and my job
is to offer you emotional assistance.

713
01:21:28,966 --> 01:21:31,176
How about some sexual assistance?

714
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:34,889
Do you want to fuck me?

715
01:21:35,931 --> 01:21:38,225
- Oh, yes.
- Well, why don't you?

716
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,978
- Because I'm a doctor and...
- Fucked a lot of doctors.

717
01:21:41,145 --> 01:21:43,104
- And I'm married.
- Fucked a lot of them, too.

718
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:44,731
Don't you think
we're getting off the point?

719
01:21:46,734 --> 01:21:48,359
Do you mind if I take off my coat?

720
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,904
No.

721
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,417
And the rest, too?

722
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,672
Now, why would you want to do
a thing like that?

723
01:22:10,507 --> 01:22:14,886
Well, because of the size of that cock
in your pants.

724
01:22:16,221 --> 01:22:18,681
I don't think you're so married.

725
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:32,154
Well?

726
01:22:33,405 --> 01:22:35,198
What do you think?

727
01:22:39,328 --> 01:22:41,204
I think you're a very attractive woman.

728
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:45,501
Would you like to touch me?

729
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:50,713
Yes and no. Yes, because I'm...

730
01:22:50,881 --> 01:22:52,173
Well, why don't you?

731
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,342
I told you why.

732
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:02,225
That's right. You're a married doctor.
I remember now.

733
01:23:02,935 --> 01:23:05,729
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do?

734
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,524
Just because I happen to have
personal and professional ethics?

735
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,445
Look, Doc, I think you're kind of shy.

736
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,243
So... I'm going to go powder my nose

737
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,662
and when I come back,

738
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,542
I hope to find your clothes
right next to mine.

739
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:30,921
And if not, we can just get back
to the mind-fuck.

740
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,170
Dr. Elliott?

741
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:26,971
Dr. Elliott?

742
01:26:30,225 --> 01:26:31,560
Dr. Elliott?

743
01:26:35,731 --> 01:26:37,565
You really are shy, aren't you?

744
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:39,109
Liz!

745
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:50,453
Behind you, Liz!

746
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:14,246
So you had me followed?

747
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:15,956
That's right.

748
01:28:16,123 --> 01:28:19,542
You've met Betty Luce, one of our best
young police... persons.

749
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,878
When I told you I was attacked
on the subway, you thought I was nuts.

750
01:28:23,046 --> 01:28:26,132
Well, Detective Luce told me
she lost you at Columbus Circle.

751
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:30,220
I didn't figure there was another blonde
following you. I mean, who would?

752
01:28:30,387 --> 01:28:33,974
Yeah, and you wrote me off as a girl
with an overactive imagination.

753
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:35,309
Yeah, something like that.

754
01:28:35,475 --> 01:28:38,270
- And she followed me to Elliott's.
- That's right.

755
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:42,231
Thank God.
What's wrong with that guy, anyway?

756
01:28:42,524 --> 01:28:44,192
- He was a transsexual.
- What?

757
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:46,069
A transsexual.

758
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:50,157
About to make the final step, but his
male side couldn't let him do it.

759
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:51,533
Male side?

760
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,286
There was Dr. Elliott,

761
01:28:54,453 --> 01:28:56,078
and there was Bobbi.

762
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:58,707
Bobbi came to me
to get psychiatric approval

763
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,417
for a sex-reassignment operation.

764
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:04,337
I thought he was unstable,
and Elliott confirmed my diagnosis.

765
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:07,506
Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.

766
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,217
The sex-change operation
was to resolve the conflict.

767
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:14,221
But as much as Bobbi tried to get it,

768
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,849
Elliott blocked it.

769
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:18,643
So Bobbi got even.

770
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,604
By killing Mrs. Miller.

771
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:24,858
Yes, she aroused Elliott,
just as you did, Miss Blake.

772
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:28,278
You mean, when Elliott got turned on,
Bobbi took over?

773
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:32,114
Yes. It was like Bobbi's red alert.

774
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,659
Elliott's penis became erect
and Bobbi took control,

775
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:38,997
trying to kill anyone
that made Elliott masculinely sexual.

776
01:29:39,164 --> 01:29:41,917
When Elliott came to my office,
it was the first time

777
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,252
I saw Bobbi's masculine self.

778
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,215
When he told me that he thought
Bobbi had killed Mrs. Miller,

779
01:29:48,382 --> 01:29:49,966
he was confessing himself.

780
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,929
I immediately called Detective Marino.

781
01:29:55,472 --> 01:29:58,225
So why the hell didn't you stop me
from going to Elliott's?

782
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:02,645
Why? Because I was at a football game
with my kids, that's why.

783
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:05,606
By the time I spoke with Dr. Levy,
you were already over there.

784
01:30:06,274 --> 01:30:08,609
So you never really thought
I killed Mrs. Miller?

785
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:13,989
No. But I had to get into Elliott's
office to find out which weirdo did,

786
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:16,868
so I pressed you into service.

787
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:18,119
Are you kidding?

788
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:21,247
So I had Miss Luce there tailing you

789
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,792
to make sure
you didn't get into too much trouble.

790
01:30:25,877 --> 01:30:26,962
Thanks.

791
01:30:28,463 --> 01:30:33,009
Well, it's always wonderful
to be of some assistance to the police.

792
01:30:33,176 --> 01:30:34,552
Are you kidding?

793
01:30:36,555 --> 01:30:38,556
So what's going to happen to Elliott?

794
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,529
Well?

795
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:56,032
There's some men and women who think
they're born in the wrong body.

796
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:57,701
They're called transsexuals.

797
01:30:57,868 --> 01:31:00,703
And all they want to do
is have their sex changed.

798
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,417
How do you do that?

799
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:09,045
Well, if you're a man
that wants to become a woman,

800
01:31:09,212 --> 01:31:11,213
you take female hormones.

801
01:31:11,381 --> 01:31:12,591
What do they do?

802
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:17,929
Well, your skin softens, you grow
breasts, and you don't get hard anymore.

803
01:31:21,725 --> 01:31:22,766
Great.

804
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,438
You sure you want to know about this?

805
01:31:26,605 --> 01:31:31,234
Yeah. It's giving me some wonderful
new ideas for a science project.

806
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:35,822
Instead of building a computer,
I could build a woman... out of me.

807
01:31:35,989 --> 01:31:40,202
Great idea. In that case,
I'll give you all the details.

808
01:31:40,368 --> 01:31:42,244
The next step is surgery.

809
01:31:42,913 --> 01:31:46,166
Let me see if I can remember
the exact word that Levy told me.

810
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:48,083
Oh, yeah, a penectomy.

811
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,337
What's that?

812
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:55,175
You know, when they take your penis
and slice it down the middle.

813
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,054
Yeah, that's what I thought it was.

814
01:31:59,221 --> 01:32:00,971
Then...

815
01:32:02,182 --> 01:32:03,766
castration...

816
01:32:05,435 --> 01:32:09,564
plastic reconstruction and
the formation of an artificial vagina.

817
01:32:09,731 --> 01:32:13,025
A vaginoplasty, to those in the know.

818
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:17,780
And I thought Elliott
just put on a dress.

819
01:32:17,948 --> 01:32:20,033
He did. And a wig, too.

820
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,203
But you see, that's no good in bed,
when you gotta take everything off.

821
01:32:23,954 --> 01:32:25,412
What's going to happen to him now?

822
01:32:26,248 --> 01:32:28,625
Well, first he has to recover
from the gun wound,

823
01:32:28,792 --> 01:32:32,796
and then if he's ever sane enough
to get out of Bellevue, they'll try him.

824
01:32:33,463 --> 01:32:36,466
And guess who's the star witness.

825
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:37,551
You.

826
01:32:37,717 --> 01:32:40,427
Right. Something
I'm really looking forward to.

827
01:32:42,931 --> 01:32:46,518
Well, I think I'm going to stick
to my computer.

828
01:32:48,061 --> 01:32:50,313
That sounds like a very good idea.

829
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,989
Look, Liz...
I gotta get home and get to work.

830
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,202
I'm going to miss having you on my tail.

831
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:07,037
It made me feel kind of safe.

832
01:33:08,498 --> 01:33:11,710
Look, you want to come home with me?
I'd love the company.

833
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,337
Wouldn't Mike mind?

834
01:33:17,048 --> 01:33:19,926
Well, Mike's out of town
on a business trip.

835
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,095
We got plenty of room.

836
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:26,015
Great. I could sure use the vacation.

837
01:33:28,226 --> 01:33:30,854
Good. I'll get the check.
