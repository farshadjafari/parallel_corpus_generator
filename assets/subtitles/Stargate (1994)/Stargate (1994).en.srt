1
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,507
Professor!

2
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:32,707
Catherine!

3
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:35,707
Professor...

4
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:41,066
We found something beautiful!

5
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,586
I don't believe it!

6
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:44,827
Big, big, big surprise!

7
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,426
Over here!

8
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,866
Taylor!

9
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,545
Dr Langford, hello.

10
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,585
What have we here?

11
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,706
Cover stones.

12
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:09,625
It's fantastic.

13
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,007
Catherine,
come!

14
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,903
What in God's name is that?

15
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,143
I wish I knew.

16
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:02,220
There are symbols
painted everywhere.

17
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:05,340
Names, titles of owners,
lists of offerings.

18
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,341
All major structures at the time...

19
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,740
...were covered with hieroglyphics.

20
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,500
When will
the academic community accept...

21
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,660
...the pharaohs of the 4th dynasty...

22
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,860
...did not build the Great Pyramid?

23
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,779
Look, look...

24
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,459
Inside the most incredible
structure ever erected...

25
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,339
...there are no writings whatsoever.

26
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,499
Doctor Jackson!

27
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,099
You left out the fact
that Colonel Vyse...

28
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:32,259
...discovered
quarrymen's inscriptions...

29
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:35,019
...of Khufu's name
within the pyramid.

30
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:38,059
Uh, his discovery was a fraud.

31
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:39,939
Well, I hope you can prove it.

32
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,139
Who do you think
built the pyramids?

33
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,578
I don't have any idea. I mean...

34
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,818
Men from Atlantis?

35
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,499
Or Martians, perhaps?

36
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:55,618
The point is not who built them,
but when they were built.

37
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:57,378
I mean, we all know...

38
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,298
...new geological evidence
dates the Sphinx...

39
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,418
...back to a much earlier period.

40
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,378
I think we have
to begin to re-evaluate...

41
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,658
...everything
we've come to accept about...

42
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,138
I mean, I've been able to show...

43
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:13,137
...a fully developed
writing system...

44
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,497
...appeared
in the first two dynasties.

45
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,137
You know, which...

46
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:20,657
Almost as if it was based...

47
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:22,737
...on an even earlier prototype.

48
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:27,577
Is there a lunch or something
that everybody...

49
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:43,496
-Doctor Jackson?
-What? Yes?

50
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:45,656
Someone wants to speak with you.

51
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:49,056
The Air Force?
What's this? What is this?

52
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,176
Step over to the car, please.

53
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:54,976
Sir?

54
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:01,095
-We goin' somewhere?
-You'll be fine.

55
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:03,135
We'll take care of these.

56
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,015
Jackson...

57
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,895
...those your parents?

58
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:15,374
Foster parents.

59
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,255
What is this all about?

60
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,775
A job.

61
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:22,855
What kind of a job?

62
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:26,494
Translation.
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

63
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:32,334
Interested?

64
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,974
I'm gonna go now.

65
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:39,373
Go where? You've just been evicted
from your apartment.

66
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:41,573
Your grants have run out.

67
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,013
Everything you own
are in those two bags.

68
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:49,173
You want to prove
that your theories are right?

69
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,213
This is your chance.

70
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:55,733
What's this?

71
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:57,413
Travel plans.

72
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:01,012
Sir?

73
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:34,371
Mrs O'Neil?

74
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:36,771
Come on in.

75
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,611
Mrs O'Neil, is your husband home?

76
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,771
Yes.

77
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:49,570
Might we be able to speak with him?

78
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,650
You can try.

79
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:29,649
Excuse me, Colonel O'Neil.
We're from General West's office.

80
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,008
Sir?

81
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:40,328
We're here to inform you
that you've been reactivated.

82
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:46,768
That guy's a mess.

83
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,488
How'd he get like that?

84
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:54,968
His kid died.
Accidentally shot himself.

85
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,408
Jesus!

86
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,166
"Clear."

87
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:26,966
Cold?

88
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,847
Allergies.

89
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:32,446
Always happens when I travel.

90
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:35,966
There you go.

91
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:38,366
Hi.

92
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:41,886
Doctor Jackson?
Doctor Gary Meyers. How are you?

93
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,326
What is this place?

94
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:46,165
Nuclear missile silo.
But it's been converted.

95
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:47,805
-Barbara Shore.
-Hello.

96
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:07,765
Okay, Jackson.

97
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:08,924
-Welcome.
-Hello!

98
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,645
This...

99
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,884
Where'd you find this?

100
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:17,364
Giza Plateau, 1928.

101
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:19,604
I've never seen anything like this.

102
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,244
Of course you haven't.

103
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,884
No-one has.

104
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,563
There's two lines of hieroglyphs.

105
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,643
The inner track
has the classic figures.

106
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:29,844
But the outer track is like
the cartouche in the centre.

107
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:32,324
It's got writing
unlike we've ever found before.

108
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:33,883
Those aren't hieroglyphics.

109
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:37,643
It might be some form
of hieratic or maybe cuneiform.

110
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:43,363
The translation
of the inner track is wrong.

111
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:46,723
Must've used Budge. I don't know
why they keep reprinting him.

112
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:48,763
Excuse me?
What... what are you doing?

113
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:50,882
We... we've used
every known technique.

114
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:53,003
That's a curious word to use
-"Gebbeh".

115
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:54,042
Yeah.

116
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:55,923
Then an adverbial "sedjem-en-ef".

117
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,003
Then "sealed"...

118
00:13:58,242 --> 00:13:59,482
...and "buried".

119
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:02,362
Excuse me.
What are you... what are you doing?

120
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:04,402
It's not "coffin".

121
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:07,522
It's "for all time".

122
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,082
Who the hell translated this?

123
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,481
I... I did.

124
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,602
It should read
"A million years into the sky...

125
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:20,001
...is Ra, sun god,
sealed and buried for all time".

126
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,961
It's not "door to heaven".

127
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,441
It is...

128
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,641
..."Stargate".

129
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,681
So why is the military
so interested...

130
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,041
...in 5,000-year-old
Egyptian tablets?

131
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,121
My report says 10,000.

132
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,880
Afternoon, Colonel.

133
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,840
Um... do I know you?

134
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,160
Col. Jack O'Neil
from General West's office.

135
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,240
I'll be taking over from now on.

136
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
This figure of 10,000 is ludicrous.

137
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,239
Egyptian culture
didn't exist until...

138
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,799
We know. But the sonic and
radiocarbon tests are conclusive.

139
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,559
These are cover stones.
Was there a tomb underneath?

140
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:08,080
No, no, no, no. But we found
something a lot more interesting.

141
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,359
Excuse me.

142
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,679
This information
has become classified.

143
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,799
From now on,
no information is to be passed on...

144
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,239
...to non-military personnel
without my express permission.

145
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,279
Catherine, what's going on here?

146
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,718
I'm not sure.

147
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,998
Colonel O'Neil?

148
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,238
I think you owe me an explanation.

149
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:35,798
I was told I had complete autonomy.

150
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:37,958
Plans change.

151
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:42,238
Why are you here? Why did they
bring you on this project?

152
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:47,197
I'm here in case you succeed.

153
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:56,797
"Searched for cuneiform and
other pre-dynastic hieroglyphics."

154
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:59,757
"No matches whatsoever.
I've exhausted all sources...

155
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:01,557
...in comparing
the cartouche symbols...

156
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:05,757
...against all writing samples
from the period, pre-and post-."

157
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,796
"Still no similarities."

158
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,037
"I'm never gonna get paid."

159
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:19,876
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

160
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:45,995
Can I borrow this?

161
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:09,274
Orion.

162
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:44,592
Hi.

163
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:46,353
Right here.

164
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:49,072
Jackson, I'd like you
to meet General West.

165
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:50,112
Hello.

166
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,072
Oh, right -General!

167
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:57,712
So you think you've solved
in 14 days...

168
00:17:57,752 --> 00:17:59,872
...what they couldn't solve
in two years?

169
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,112
Two years?

170
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:06,672
Any time.

171
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:08,951
Um...

172
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:12,511
I have some stuff to look at.

173
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:15,511
Uh... if you'll just pass 'em down.

174
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:17,711
You'll have to share them cos I...

175
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,671
Sorry, I don't have enough of those.

176
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,151
But, anyway... Okay, all right.

177
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,751
We're looking at a picture
of the cover stones.

178
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,631
Now, on the outer track...

179
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:29,190
...these figures
that you had believed...

180
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,470
...to be words to be translated
were, in fact...

181
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,070
Sorry about that.

182
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,950
Were, in fact, star constellations.

183
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,349
These constellations
were placed in a unique order...

184
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,789
...forming a map
or an address of sorts.

185
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:52,150
Seven points to outline
a course to a position.

186
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,469
And, uh...

187
00:18:56,349 --> 00:19:01,069
...to find the destination within
any three-dimensional space...

188
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:04,949
...we need six points...

189
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:10,188
...to determine an exact location.

190
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:12,589
You said you needed seven points.

191
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:15,548
Well, no. Six for the destination.

192
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,868
But to chart a course you need...

193
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:21,308
...a point of origin.

194
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:24,108
Except there's only six symbols
in the cartouche.

195
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:27,187
The seventh actually
isn't inside the cartouche.

196
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,707
It's below it here...

197
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:32,147
...designated
by a little pyramid with...

198
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:34,907
...two...

199
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:37,828
...funny...

200
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,387
...neat little guys...

201
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:43,628
...and a funny little line
coming out of the top.

202
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:48,907
Anyway, uh...

203
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,227
He did it.

204
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:54,267
No! That symbol
isn't anywhere on the device.

205
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:57,386
What device?

206
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,427
Show him.

207
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,185
What is that?

208
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,384
It's your "Stargate".

209
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:58,544
Come, Jackson.

210
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:02,824
"Technical personnel
report to command centre."

211
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,304
Monitors up!

212
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:08,624
Monitors are up.

213
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:12,743
Mitch, bring up the details
on the centre monitor, please.

214
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:15,944
I've got details... on.

215
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:35,943
Hold it!

216
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:37,063
Wait.

217
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:40,422
Do you have a?

218
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:42,462
Oh, here. Sorry.

219
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:44,462
Hey, hey, hey, don't!

220
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:45,861
Two figures...

221
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:47,862
...on either side...

222
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:51,862
...praying beside a pyramid
with the sun directly above it.

223
00:21:52,741 --> 00:21:54,101
He's right.

224
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:56,181
It was in front of us
the whole time.

225
00:21:56,822 --> 00:21:58,661
General West...

226
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,781
...Jackson has identified
the seventh symbol.

227
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,941
Go ahead.

228
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:06,021
Programming seventh symbol
into computer.

229
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:07,741
Chevron one is holding.

230
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:10,501
Chevron one is locked in place.

231
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,781
Power output at 23 per cent.

232
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,020
Chevron two is holding.

233
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,100
"Engage."

234
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,340
Chevron two is locked in place.

235
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,140
We're at 35 per cent.

236
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,740
We got a condition red in the gate.

237
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,260
Evacuate all personnel.

238
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,420
Area secure. Heading back.
Seal off the door.

239
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,540
It was under the cover stones?

240
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:44,019
Yes. My father found it in 1928.

241
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,459
Made out of a mineral
unlike any found on Earth.

242
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,939
Chevron five locked in place.

243
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,739
79 per cent.

244
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:56,619
Chevron six is holding.

245
00:22:57,858 --> 00:23:00,299
Chevron six is locked in place.

246
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,378
This is as far as we have
ever been able to get.

247
00:23:14,178 --> 00:23:15,378
Chevron seven...

248
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:18,418
"Engage."

249
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,298
Chevron seven is locked in place.

250
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,096
Send in the probe.

251
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:47,777
Let's go! Let's go!

252
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:54,217
Yes, sir.

253
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,896
Record all information
from the Stargate.

254
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:05,936
Clear inner silo for approach.

255
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:07,535
"Clear inner silo."

256
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,936
Everybody outta here!
Let's go, let's go.

257
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,494
It's guiding itself.
Can you believe that?

258
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:11,693
The beam has locked itself
onto a point somewhere...

259
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:14,772
...in the Kaliam galaxy.

260
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,893
It has mass. It could be a moon
or a large asteroid.

261
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,692
Where are we on that map?

262
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:21,332
The blue dot.

263
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:30,652
That's right, Jackson.

264
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,852
It's on the other side
of the known universe.

265
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,291
We're losing the signal.

266
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:47,251
This is the information
the probe sent back to us.

267
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:49,972
Freeze and enhance.

268
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:53,291
You can clearly see the gate
on the other side.

269
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:57,091
Both gates must have functioned
as a doorway between our worlds.

270
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,371
These readings tell us
it's an atmospheric match.

271
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,491
Barometric pressure, temperature...

272
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,930
...and, most importantly, oxygen.

273
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:09,930
These markings are different.

274
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:12,930
They don't match the symbols
on our gate.

275
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,090
That's why we may have to abort.

276
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,410
This project is for naught
without a reconnaissance mission.

277
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:21,890
Once on the other side...

278
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,449
...we'd have to decipher
the markings on their gate...

279
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,050
...and, in essence, dial home...

280
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,210
...in order to bring the team back.

281
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,889
Based on this new information,
I don't see how we can do that.

282
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,089
Well, I could do that.

283
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:40,609
Are you sure?

284
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:48,568
Positive.

285
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,609
Your call.

286
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:00,328
You're on the team.

287
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:46,847
You're understand, this complicated thinks.

288
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:51,806
That's why I want you, Jack.

289
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:57,005
We've open the doorway to world, we've know nothing about.

290
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:08,045
Jackson...

291
00:28:09,326 --> 00:28:10,765
Hello. Hi.

292
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,685
I have something for you.

293
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,405
No, I...

294
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:16,445
Yes.

295
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:21,405
I found it with Stargate
when I was a child.

296
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:23,604
It has brought me luck.

297
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:29,924
You can bring it back to me.

298
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:45,924
Back-up storage.

299
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,684
Reserve power on.

300
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:51,243
All right, we're secure.
Let's clear this area.

301
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:55,763
Surveillance and monitoring
equipment, reserve power...

302
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:56,803
...and on.

303
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:06,323
If anybody has anything to say,
now's the time to say it.

304
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:14,922
"Vector tracking set."

305
00:30:47,118 --> 00:30:49,798
Molecular deconstruction
in progress.

306
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:06,074
Jackson, it's all right.
It's over. Stay with him.

307
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:08,154
Jackson, listen to me. Keep moving.

308
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,115
It wears off in a minute.

309
00:32:10,155 --> 00:32:12,235
What a rush!

310
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:17,155
Prepare to move out.

311
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:36,874
Three teams. Let's go.

312
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,913
"White team, go."

313
00:32:53,753 --> 00:32:55,673
Brown, Freeman, bring up the rear!

314
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:09,472
"Team two, move up."

315
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,872
Clear. No contact.

316
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,991
Freeze. Hold for sounds.

317
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,431
"One-two ratio stable."

318
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,231
Conditions are similar to inside.

319
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,271
I wanna take a look around.

320
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,950
Kawalsky. Feretti.

321
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:23,589
"Move up there."

322
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:54,748
I knew it.

323
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:01,227
"Point three, three, two."

324
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,187
Report.

325
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:06,707
Our quarter-mile perimeter survey
is just about complete, sir.

326
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:14,426
Wrap this up and
get everybody back inside.

327
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,787
I want you all back through
the Stargate within the hour.

328
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:20,986
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Colonel?

329
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:22,867
-Sir?
-Jackson!

330
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,866
Start working on the Stargate.

331
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:28,226
-What's that all about?
-I don't know, Feretti.

332
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:30,305
I'm gonna need more time.

333
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:32,466
There's bound to be
more structures here.

334
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,946
Or some other traces
of civilisation.

335
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:38,786
Not this trip. Just get back
in there and re-establish contact.

336
00:35:38,825 --> 00:35:41,865
It's not so easy. This is a replica
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

337
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:45,305
We won't find any hieroglyphic
inscriptions or carved relief.

338
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:47,945
I mean,
we really need to look around more.

339
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:52,225
Your job is to realign the Stargate.
Can you do that or not?

340
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,585
I can't.

341
00:35:58,704 --> 00:36:00,664
You can't or you won't?

342
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,704
I can decipher the symbols
on the Stargate...

343
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,744
...but I need an order of alignment.

344
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:07,344
Those co-ordinates were
on tablets back on Earth.

345
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:10,024
There must be something
like that here and I just...

346
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:11,864
I just need to find it.

347
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:16,544
Find it?
What do you mean, find it?

348
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:18,863
You didn't say anything
about finding anything.

349
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:21,144
Well, I assumed the tablets
would be here.

350
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:22,183
You assumed?

351
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,184
You're a lyin' son of a bitch!

352
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,263
You didn't say a word
about finding anything!

353
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:29,343
Kawalsky.

354
00:36:29,384 --> 00:36:33,104
Set up a camp down here.
Organise our supplies.

355
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:34,543
Sir...

356
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,863
You've got your orders.

357
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:47,903
This is hot.

358
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:50,103
You know, I can't believe
we're stuck here.

359
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:52,303
Don't be such a doomsayer, Feretti.

360
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:54,582
-Yeah, give it a rest.
-Yes, please.

361
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:56,222
If we're not back soon...

362
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:58,622
...they'll turn on the gate
from the other side.

363
00:36:58,662 --> 00:37:00,422
Oh, no. It doesn't work that way.

364
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:04,742
If you don't turn it on from here,
we're screwed. Okay?

365
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:08,022
So I'm tellin' you guys,
we're not goin' anywhere.

366
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,422
Shut up.

367
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:11,861
This is a nice tent.

368
00:37:12,742 --> 00:37:15,501
Oh, we each get a tent.
That's nice.

369
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,340
What the hell is that?

370
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,499
I got everything here but sun block.

371
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Hey!

372
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,939
-Hi.
-Hey.

373
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,819
Isn't there something
you should be doing?

374
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,660
Like gettin' us outta here?!

375
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,619
Foot powder. Great (!)

376
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:41,777
Base camp is up, sir.

377
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:40,415
Where's Jackson?

378
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:56,215
It's okay. It's okay.

379
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:58,374
Shh, shh, shh...

380
00:39:58,454 --> 00:39:59,854
That's a good boy.

381
00:39:59,894 --> 00:40:01,494
Good boy.

382
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,214
It's okay.

383
00:40:05,254 --> 00:40:06,734
Good boy.

384
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:08,333
What?

385
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:10,413
What do you want?

386
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:11,734
You want some of this?

387
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:14,933
Here you go. You like that?

388
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:19,773
I wouldn't feed that thing!

389
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:22,093
It's got a harness!

390
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,733
It's domesticated!

391
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:31,333
-Damn it!
-Let go of it!

392
00:40:41,893 --> 00:40:43,492
Do something!

393
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:53,092
Help me!

394
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,810
You okay, Jackson?

395
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,730
Kawalsky.

396
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,290
You dropped these.

397
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,329
Brown.

398
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,409
Get away from me.

399
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:57,086
Easy...

400
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:22,405
All right, Jackson.

401
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,525
You're on.

402
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:26,765
Me?

403
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:30,645
You're the linguist.
Try to talk to 'em.

404
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:40,045
Hi.

405
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:10,883
What the hell did you say to him?

406
00:44:10,923 --> 00:44:12,323
Nothing.

407
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:28,962
Hey...

408
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:31,083
Hm?

409
00:44:31,122 --> 00:44:33,122
It's okay.

410
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,482
It's okay. See?

411
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,281
"Quartz primary element."

412
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:57,079
I can't make it out. It sounds
familiar. A bit like Berber.

413
00:45:57,118 --> 00:45:58,678
Or maybe it's Chadic or Omotic.

414
00:46:25,317 --> 00:46:26,797
Thank you.

415
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:43,837
Mmmm!

416
00:47:02,796 --> 00:47:03,795
Bonni...

417
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,756
Bonniwae!

418
00:47:05,796 --> 00:47:07,195
Bonniwae?

419
00:47:07,235 --> 00:47:08,635
Bonniwae!

420
00:47:08,715 --> 00:47:10,235
Bonniwae. Bonniwae.

421
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:11,635
What's that mean?

422
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:13,675
I have no idea.

423
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,715
He's inviting us to go with him.

424
00:47:17,755 --> 00:47:19,755
How can you be so sure?

425
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:23,954
Because he's inviting us
to go with him.

426
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,675
We were looking
for signs of civilisation.

427
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:30,195
Obviously, we've found it.

428
00:47:30,234 --> 00:47:32,754
You want me to get us back home,
this is our best shot.

429
00:47:32,795 --> 00:47:33,915
Colonel, he's right.

430
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:37,034
I took some readings
on what they're mining.

431
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:40,874
This is the same material
as the Stargate.

432
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,354
Radio base camp.

433
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:50,553
Tell them to keep that area secured
until we get back.

434
00:47:50,594 --> 00:47:51,594
Yes, sir.

435
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:32,627
The eye of Ra.

436
00:50:35,586 --> 00:50:37,427
It's the Egyptian sun god.

437
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:40,867
They think he sent us here.

438
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:44,546
Yeah. Wonder what could've
given 'em that idea.

439
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,626
Ra.

440
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:51,266
Ra?

441
00:50:57,825 --> 00:50:59,825
Where are they all going?

442
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:03,665
Come in. Come in.

443
00:51:03,705 --> 00:51:05,425
Feretti, I can't hear you.

444
00:51:05,465 --> 00:51:07,465
Sir, I can't make this out.

445
00:51:08,185 --> 00:51:09,824
Feretti, say again.

446
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:13,264
We have to abandon base camp!

447
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:16,665
Repeat,
we have to abandon base camp!

448
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:19,184
It's useless!
It won't work in this!

449
00:51:19,225 --> 00:51:20,745
Freeman, let's go! Let's go!

450
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:22,224
Everybody back inside!

451
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:26,624
Come on!
Take batteries!

452
00:51:36,944 --> 00:51:38,943
We're gonna back, right now.

453
00:51:40,863 --> 00:51:41,783
Wait!

454
00:52:31,021 --> 00:52:32,901
Stay here!

455
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,661
What is it colonel?
Sand storm, coming this way!

456
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,901
And what about,
excellent reason to shoot everyone.

457
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,980
We'll stay it's over.

458
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,380
Sorry.

459
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:26,499
The pyramid! Back to the pyramid!

460
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,938
Where the hell did that come from?

461
00:53:36,858 --> 00:53:38,978
Kawalsky, Brown, do you read?

462
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:00,217
Hey, Jackson. I don't think
we should eat any food here.

463
00:54:00,258 --> 00:54:03,257
I don't know.
They might consider that an insult.

464
00:54:13,377 --> 00:54:17,097
Well, we don't want to offend them
now, do we, Daniel?

465
00:54:30,776 --> 00:54:32,416
Tastes like chicken.

466
00:54:32,456 --> 00:54:33,896
Tastes like chicken.

467
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,616
It's good.

468
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,216
It tastes...

469
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:44,736
Tastes like chicken.

470
00:54:44,775 --> 00:54:46,855
Tastes like chicken. Good!

471
00:54:50,255 --> 00:54:51,615
Jackson.

472
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,015
You said
that was an Egyptian symbol.

473
00:54:54,055 --> 00:54:56,135
Yeah. The eye of Ra.

474
00:54:56,175 --> 00:55:01,094
Would you say, then, that if they
know one Egyptian symbol?

475
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,134
Yes.

476
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:04,855
Yes.

477
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,175
No, no.

478
00:55:27,934 --> 00:55:29,174
What's going on?

479
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:36,213
It seems like writing
is forbidden to them.

480
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,973
What? What?

481
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,493
They want me to go with them!

482
00:55:51,533 --> 00:55:52,932
Should I stay?

483
00:55:52,972 --> 00:55:54,332
I'll go with them.

484
00:55:55,093 --> 00:55:57,092
I'll go. I'll be fine.

485
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:05,531
Okay, that's good. All right.

486
00:56:07,132 --> 00:56:09,132
What is that smell?

487
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:10,172
Oh, it's...

488
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:12,212
Okay, that's good.

489
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:14,572
That's good.
My hands are pretty clean.

490
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:16,251
Thank you very, very much.

491
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,732
Thank you very...

492
00:56:18,891 --> 00:56:20,691
Thank you. That was great.

493
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:23,212
I smell much better now...

494
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:25,412
Yes...

495
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:29,251
Oh, Christ.

496
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:31,131
I smell like a yak.

497
00:56:33,451 --> 00:56:35,411
No, no, please. No more.

498
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,651
Please.

499
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,131
Please, no more.

500
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:40,170
I'm fine. I'm clean, I'm...

501
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,930
I'm...

502
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:47,410
I thought... you were
one of the other... cleaning...

503
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:03,009
No. No, no, no, no. You don't...

504
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,849
You don't have to do that. Please.

505
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,410
Maybe you should go.

506
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:08,449
Okay? It's okay.

507
00:57:08,769 --> 00:57:10,769
Maybe you should go.

508
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,809
No, it's okay. It's all right.

509
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:14,849
Here, let me take care of it.

510
00:57:26,328 --> 00:57:27,488
No, no, no.

511
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:29,169
It's me.

512
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:31,208
I wanted to thank you. I wanted...

513
00:57:31,249 --> 00:57:33,008
I'm very... I'm very happy.

514
00:57:35,128 --> 00:57:36,328
Thank you.

515
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:44,688
Um...

516
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:46,728
Daniel.

517
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:48,847
Daniel.

518
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:51,808
No. Uh... I'm, uh...

519
00:57:54,207 --> 00:57:55,447
Daniel.

520
00:57:55,487 --> 00:57:57,247
I'm Daniel.

521
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:00,487
Sha'uri.

522
00:58:01,407 --> 00:58:02,847
Sha'uri.

523
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:08,446
Uh... you, uh...

524
00:58:08,846 --> 00:58:10,447
We came...

525
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:13,327
This...

526
00:58:13,686 --> 00:58:15,166
...pyramid.

527
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:16,206
See, we...

528
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:20,446
...we came from the pyramid.

529
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,926
It's... it's okay.

530
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,566
Never mind.

531
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,605
It's okay.

532
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,644
Earth.

533
00:59:01,044 --> 00:59:03,364
You... you know the symbol?

534
00:59:03,405 --> 00:59:05,404
You know the symbol?

535
00:59:05,444 --> 00:59:07,684
You've seen... the symbol?

536
00:59:11,404 --> 00:59:13,364
Show me.

537
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:15,404
You show me.

538
00:59:18,484 --> 00:59:20,964
Kawalsky, this is base.
Do you copy?

539
00:59:21,843 --> 00:59:23,883
You're wasting the battery.

540
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:27,803
You won't get anything in this
storm. Wait till it passes.

541
00:59:27,843 --> 00:59:28,923
Yeah, right.

542
00:59:29,563 --> 00:59:31,363
If it passes.

543
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:01,799
What the hell is goin' on?

544
01:02:01,476 --> 01:02:03,477
All right, spread out.

545
01:02:04,356 --> 01:02:06,356
Behind the columns -move!

546
01:03:47,152 --> 01:03:49,312
It's okay. It's just a lighter.

547
01:03:54,071 --> 01:03:55,631
See?

548
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:00,871
Here.

549
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,791
Yeah, it's pretty fabulous.

550
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:06,508
Yeah, you're right.

551
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:08,548
It's pretty stupid.

552
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:16,188
No, you... keep it.

553
01:05:19,068 --> 01:05:20,548
It's yours.

554
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:32,668
No!

555
01:05:35,747 --> 01:05:37,787
It's dangerous!

556
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,626
What is this place?

557
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:21,305
Cypian.

558
01:06:21,385 --> 01:06:22,945
Rem-e-n-jef.

559
01:06:22,985 --> 01:06:25,025
Bah-ka-naf Sema.

560
01:06:25,105 --> 01:06:27,144
Tah-pah-rief.

561
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:29,744
I'll be damned!

562
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:31,865
Tah-pah-rief?

563
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:33,425
What?

564
01:06:34,465 --> 01:06:35,865
Tah-pah-rief?

565
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:37,864
Tah-pah-rief?

566
01:06:37,904 --> 01:06:39,465
Tah-pah-rief.

567
01:06:40,504 --> 01:06:42,065
Tah-pah-rief.

568
01:06:42,144 --> 01:06:43,704
Tah-pah...

569
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:45,784
Neh-jed?

570
01:06:45,864 --> 01:06:46,784
Neh-jed?

571
01:06:46,864 --> 01:06:47,784
Neh-dah.

572
01:06:47,864 --> 01:06:49,903
Neh-dah. Neh-dah.

573
01:06:50,544 --> 01:06:51,504
Tiu.

574
01:06:51,584 --> 01:06:53,944
Tiu. Tiu.

575
01:06:54,104 --> 01:06:55,423
Ah...

576
01:06:55,464 --> 01:06:56,783
Netjer?

577
01:06:56,824 --> 01:06:58,143
Netjer-u?

578
01:06:58,224 --> 01:06:59,423
Bah? Netjer-u?

579
01:06:59,503 --> 01:07:00,463
Natay.

580
01:07:00,544 --> 01:07:02,103
Naturu.

581
01:07:02,183 --> 01:07:04,144
Natay. Naturu.

582
01:07:04,223 --> 01:07:06,023
Nafi.

583
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,180
No signal at all?

584
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:04,700
Nothing.

585
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:09,340
More interference?

586
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:11,300
No.

587
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,500
They're simply not there.

588
01:08:37,339 --> 01:08:39,499
I haven't been able
to locate Jackson, sir.

589
01:08:57,859 --> 01:08:59,818
I'm looking for Jackson.

590
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:02,378
Jackson.
The guy who wears this jacket.

591
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:06,658
He's, uh, he's got, like,
long hair that comes down...

592
01:09:06,777 --> 01:09:07,978
No...

593
01:09:08,058 --> 01:09:10,018
No, no, no. It...

594
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:11,658
He wears glasses...

595
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:13,497
...so he can see.

596
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:22,818
I guess the word "dweeb"
doesn't mean anything to you guys.

597
01:09:22,857 --> 01:09:26,737
I'm on planet X looking for a dweeb
who wears green fatigues.

598
01:09:26,817 --> 01:09:29,177
He wears this jacket.
He's got long hair.

599
01:09:29,297 --> 01:09:31,937
It comes over his eyes,
he wears glasses, and...

600
01:09:32,016 --> 01:09:33,577
...sneezes.

601
01:09:40,296 --> 01:09:41,416
Chicken.

602
01:09:41,737 --> 01:09:42,896
Chicken.

603
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:46,016
Chicken. Chicken man. You got it.

604
01:09:54,216 --> 01:09:56,256
You want this?

605
01:10:27,734 --> 01:10:30,295
I thought
you couldn't speak their language.

606
01:10:30,374 --> 01:10:32,334
Hi... Scared me.

607
01:10:33,174 --> 01:10:35,414
It's an ancient Egyptian dialect.

608
01:10:35,494 --> 01:10:38,934
Unlike the rest of their culture,
it's evolved independently.

609
01:10:38,974 --> 01:10:40,774
But once you know the vowels...

610
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:42,854
Just answer the question.

611
01:10:42,933 --> 01:10:46,133
Well, I mean, I just
had to learn how to pronounce it.

612
01:10:46,214 --> 01:10:48,573
It hasn't been a living,
spoken language...

613
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:50,613
...in more than 1,000 years.

614
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:55,254
Look at this. It says
a traveller from distant stars...

615
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,053
...escaped from a dying world...

616
01:10:57,093 --> 01:11:00,212
...looking for a way
to extend his own life.

617
01:11:00,293 --> 01:11:03,413
His body decaying and weak,
he couldn't prevent his own demise.

618
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:06,932
Apparently, his whole species
was becoming extinct.

619
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:09,213
So he travelled...

620
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:11,013
...or searched the galaxies...

621
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:13,812
...looking for a way to cheat death.

622
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:14,892
And, uh...

623
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:18,412
...look here.
He came to a world rich with life...

624
01:11:18,492 --> 01:11:21,372
...where he encountered
a primitive race.

625
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:23,212
Humans.

626
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:26,732
A species which, with all
his powers and knowledge...

627
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:28,452
...he could maintain indefinitely.

628
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:32,611
He realised within a human body
he had a chance for a new life.

629
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:36,291
Now, he apparently found
a young boy.

630
01:11:36,372 --> 01:11:40,491
It says as the frightened villagers
ran, night became day.

631
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,451
Curious and without fear,
he walked towards the light.

632
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:51,370
Ra took him
and possessed his body...

633
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:55,530
...like some kind of a parasite
looking for a host.

634
01:11:55,571 --> 01:12:00,010
And, inhabiting this human form,
he appointed himself ruler.

635
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:04,850
He used the Stargate to bring
people to this planet...

636
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,050
...as workers for the mines.

637
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,970
Just like the one we saw.

638
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:13,170
This mineral is the building
block of all his technology.

639
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,409
With this
he can sustain eternal life.

640
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:16,450
Now...

641
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,529
...something happened on Earth.

642
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:23,010
A rebellion or uprising,
and the Stargate was buried there.

643
01:12:23,049 --> 01:12:27,009
Fearful of a rebellion here,
Ra outlawed reading and writing.

644
01:12:27,049 --> 01:12:29,409
He didn't want people
to remember the truth.

645
01:12:29,889 --> 01:12:32,529
Jackson, I think
you'd better look at this.

646
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,528
That's it.
That's what we're looking for.

647
01:12:43,648 --> 01:12:45,288
They must've hidden it here...

648
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:48,288
...in hopes that one day
the gate on Earth could be reopened.

649
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:51,048
I knew they'd have it
written down someplace.

650
01:12:51,528 --> 01:12:53,088
Wait a minute.

651
01:12:53,128 --> 01:12:55,287
Where's the seventh symbol?

652
01:12:55,368 --> 01:12:56,848
It must have broken.

653
01:12:56,927 --> 01:12:58,888
It's got to be here somewhere.

654
01:13:01,008 --> 01:13:03,208
I got it here.

655
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:08,327
It's worn off.

656
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:13,487
I can't make it work
without the seventh symbol.

657
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:16,007
All right, that's it.

658
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:17,567
Kawalsky. Brown.

659
01:13:30,207 --> 01:13:31,766
Come on, Jackson!

660
01:14:15,524 --> 01:14:17,484
What the hell is that?

661
01:14:24,164 --> 01:14:25,404
Here.

662
01:14:25,484 --> 01:14:27,284
You might need this.

663
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,320
Look out!

664
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,120
Where are we going?

665
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,000
Why are we going to the Stargate?
I can't make it work.

666
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,120
Stay here and shoot anything
that comes down that ramp.

667
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,480
What are you doing?

668
01:15:58,519 --> 01:15:59,520
Just cover me.

669
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,840
What is that?

670
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,920
-What are you looking for?
-It's gone.

671
01:16:45,358 --> 01:16:46,918
Put it down, Jackson.

672
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:49,832
You have come here to destroy me.

673
01:18:52,592 --> 01:18:54,073
What is that?

674
01:18:59,552 --> 01:19:03,072
It's a bomb, isn't it?
That's what you were looking for.

675
01:19:03,151 --> 01:19:04,952
What the hell were you thinking?

676
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:07,032
What did you come here for?

677
01:19:55,269 --> 01:19:56,430
Wait! Don't!

678
01:19:58,469 --> 01:19:59,429
Wait!

679
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:00,349
No! No!

680
01:20:57,067 --> 01:20:58,787
Colonel! It's me!

681
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:01,506
You all right?

682
01:21:11,946 --> 01:21:13,147
Where's Jackson?

683
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,781
Sha'uri, what happened here?

684
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:15,181
Ra punished us.

685
01:23:15,261 --> 01:23:16,661
Why?

686
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,021
What happened to Daniel?

687
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:24,020
What happened to Daniel?

688
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:49,459
Son, we should not have helped
the strangers.

689
01:26:29,372 --> 01:26:31,092
I was dead?

690
01:26:37,972 --> 01:26:41,531
Your bodies, so easy to repair.

691
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:48,452
You have advanced much...

692
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:52,332
...harnessed the power of the atom.

693
01:26:52,411 --> 01:26:54,372
What are you going to do?

694
01:26:57,331 --> 01:27:01,691
You should not
have reopened the gate.

695
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:11,091
Soon, I will send your weapon
back to your world...

696
01:27:11,131 --> 01:27:14,570
...with a shipment of our mineral...

697
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:19,850
...which will increase
your weapon's destructive power...

698
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,050
...a hundredfold!

699
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:24,370
Why would you do that?

700
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:27,170
I created your civilisation.

701
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,049
Now I will destroy it!

702
01:27:48,649 --> 01:27:52,529
But before my workers
question my authority...

703
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:55,529
...you will prove
that I am their one god...

704
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:59,048
...by killing your companions.

705
01:28:01,248 --> 01:28:02,648
If I refuse?

706
01:28:03,369 --> 01:28:06,648
Then I will destroy you...

707
01:28:06,688 --> 01:28:09,728
...and all who have seen you.

708
01:28:09,808 --> 01:28:15,168
There can only be one Ra!

709
01:28:32,447 --> 01:28:33,407
Sha'uri...

710
01:28:33,487 --> 01:28:36,446
...Ra has called an assembly...

711
01:28:36,927 --> 01:28:39,567
...an execution.

712
01:28:39,646 --> 01:28:42,926
Skaara, Nabeh,
I want you all to listen.

713
01:28:48,886 --> 01:28:51,606
We can't let this happen.

714
01:28:51,646 --> 01:28:54,206
I want you to know
what Daniel told me...

715
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:57,526
...about where our people
came from...

716
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:02,245
...and why we can no longer
live as slaves.

717
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:42,322
Come on!

718
01:30:57,081 --> 01:30:58,040
Freeman!

719
01:31:00,281 --> 01:31:01,600
Freeman!

720
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,440
Over there! Come on!

721
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,480
Kawalsky!

722
01:32:00,638 --> 01:32:01,758
Jacson!

723
01:32:55,076 --> 01:32:57,036
To our victory!

724
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:04,235
We recovered your weapons.

725
01:33:06,435 --> 01:33:07,835
Here, Colonel.

726
01:33:11,994 --> 01:33:13,794
So what do you think?

727
01:33:14,275 --> 01:33:16,315
They're not exactly
Special Forces...

728
01:33:16,394 --> 01:33:19,115
...but they sure were
eager to join up!

729
01:33:19,194 --> 01:33:22,474
Take these guns away
before they hurt themselves.

730
01:33:23,834 --> 01:33:24,794
Sir?

731
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:26,594
You heard me. Send 'em all home.

732
01:33:26,634 --> 01:33:29,194
There's no place
for these kids to go.

733
01:33:29,274 --> 01:33:31,714
Anyway, we could sure
use their help.

734
01:33:31,794 --> 01:33:33,514
For what?!

735
01:33:33,554 --> 01:33:34,874
Huh?

736
01:33:34,913 --> 01:33:36,713
To do what?!

737
01:33:46,513 --> 01:33:48,553
Why don't you
just tell 'em everything?

738
01:33:50,273 --> 01:33:53,753
Why don't you tell 'em
about the bomb?

739
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:55,713
What's he talkin' about?

740
01:34:01,033 --> 01:34:02,993
My orders were simple.

741
01:34:05,153 --> 01:34:08,272
Track down signs
of any possible danger.

742
01:34:08,353 --> 01:34:10,392
If I found any,
blow up the Stargate.

743
01:34:12,193 --> 01:34:13,832
Well, I found some.

744
01:34:13,872 --> 01:34:15,512
Well, your bomb is his now.

745
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,192
And tomorrow
he's gonna send it back to Earth.

746
01:34:18,272 --> 01:34:20,752
With a shipment of that mineral
they mine here.

747
01:34:20,832 --> 01:34:22,391
And when it goes off...

748
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:25,072
...it'll be 100 times
more destructive...

749
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:28,632
...than that bomb alone
is capable of.

750
01:34:28,711 --> 01:34:31,591
I'll intercept that bomb
before he can send it through.

751
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:33,191
Why wasn't I told of this?

752
01:34:33,312 --> 01:34:36,752
There was no reason to tell you.
You weren't supposed to be here.

753
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:38,831
You were all gonna
go back with Daniel.

754
01:34:38,911 --> 01:34:42,031
I was gonna stay behind
and blow up the Stargate...

755
01:34:42,071 --> 01:34:43,791
...and that's what I'm gonna do.

756
01:34:43,831 --> 01:34:46,071
It's the gate on Earth
that poses the threat.

757
01:34:46,151 --> 01:34:47,951
That's the one
we have to shut down.

758
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:49,830
You're absolutely right.

759
01:34:49,911 --> 01:34:53,351
But since you don't know
how to get us back...

760
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:55,951
...we don't have that option, do we?

761
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:16,149
Where are they?

762
01:35:19,229 --> 01:35:21,029
Answer!

763
01:35:21,069 --> 01:35:23,869
We looked everywhere.

764
01:35:25,549 --> 01:35:27,508
Some kids are helping them.

765
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:56,948
You would have accepted that
no matter what happened...

766
01:35:56,988 --> 01:35:59,188
...you would not be going home?

767
01:36:00,867 --> 01:36:02,987
Don't you have people
who care about you?

768
01:36:03,067 --> 01:36:04,867
Do you have a family?

769
01:36:06,547 --> 01:36:07,947
I had a family.

770
01:36:11,227 --> 01:36:14,267
No-one should have to outlive
their own child.

771
01:36:15,067 --> 01:36:16,626
I don't wanna die.

772
01:36:17,827 --> 01:36:19,547
Your men don't wanna die.

773
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:22,347
And these people here
don't wanna die.

774
01:36:23,307 --> 01:36:25,706
It's a shame
you're in such a hurry to.

775
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,265
How could you let them escape?

776
01:37:23,384 --> 01:37:26,583
I will not accept failure!

777
01:38:03,662 --> 01:38:05,222
Why are you laughing?

778
01:38:05,302 --> 01:38:07,422
Husbands don't do this work.

779
01:38:10,022 --> 01:38:11,421
Husband?

780
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:39,980
Married?

781
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:43,300
Don't be angry.

782
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,300
I didn't tell them.

783
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:48,980
Tell them what?

784
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:57,939
That you did not want me.

785
01:39:37,618 --> 01:39:39,658
What are you drawing?

786
01:39:42,497 --> 01:39:44,458
The day of our victory.

787
01:40:04,097 --> 01:40:05,897
Connect the moons.

788
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:13,017
That's it.

789
01:40:15,257 --> 01:40:17,056
The point of origin.

790
01:40:20,176 --> 01:40:21,896
What're you doing?

791
01:40:21,936 --> 01:40:23,256
I've found it!

792
01:40:23,296 --> 01:40:24,936
What're you talkin' about?

793
01:40:24,976 --> 01:40:27,296
The seventh symbol.

794
01:40:29,176 --> 01:40:31,136
We're goin' home.

795
01:40:54,975 --> 01:40:56,375
Let's go.

796
01:40:59,574 --> 01:41:01,894
You'll bring disaster
on all of us, son.

797
01:41:01,974 --> 01:41:05,254
Father, we will not live as slaves.

798
01:41:10,574 --> 01:41:11,654
Kasuf!

799
01:41:14,774 --> 01:41:16,893
Take a look at your gods.

800
01:41:23,814 --> 01:41:25,533
Take a good look.

801
01:41:48,532 --> 01:41:50,573
The caravan is approaching.

802
01:41:53,332 --> 01:41:55,692
Send the bomb down to the Stargate.

803
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:57,370
What's happening up there?

804
01:43:21,089 --> 01:43:22,248
How you doin'?

805
01:43:35,687 --> 01:43:36,767
Damn!

806
01:43:36,848 --> 01:43:38,967
Come on, Feretti!

807
01:43:48,687 --> 01:43:49,727
Come on!

808
01:43:51,007 --> 01:43:53,127
Get that door!

809
01:44:17,286 --> 01:44:19,246
Hey, you okay? You all right?

810
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:27,845
Spread out!

811
01:44:35,765 --> 01:44:37,805
Let's go!

812
01:44:41,764 --> 01:44:42,724
We're dead!

813
01:44:42,805 --> 01:44:45,604
-Quit talkin' like that!
-Well, what are we gonna do!

814
01:44:45,644 --> 01:44:46,604
Cover me.

815
01:44:46,685 --> 01:44:48,165
Cover you?!

816
01:44:48,605 --> 01:44:49,685
Kawalsky!

817
01:44:59,804 --> 01:45:02,244
Feretti,
help me push this thing over!

818
01:45:13,684 --> 01:45:15,484
Send the bomb to Earth now!

819
01:45:15,563 --> 01:45:17,964
I will send it myself!

820
01:45:35,763 --> 01:45:38,722
-What are you doing?
-Completing this mission.

821
01:45:38,803 --> 01:45:41,762
We agreed to dismantle
the gate on the other side.

822
01:45:41,802 --> 01:45:43,762
And you will.

823
01:45:43,882 --> 01:45:45,842
That's your job now.

824
01:45:45,922 --> 01:45:48,802
I'm gonna stay here,
make sure this goes off.

825
01:45:57,081 --> 01:45:59,041
You've got seven minutes.

826
01:46:48,839 --> 01:46:49,799
What are you doing?

827
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:54,199
Jackson!

828
01:46:54,279 --> 01:46:55,679
Wait for me.

829
01:48:57,354 --> 01:49:00,633
-You got any rounds, Feretti?
-We're all out of ammo!

830
01:49:00,713 --> 01:49:02,033
Incoming!

831
01:49:29,832 --> 01:49:33,032
Kawalsky, we gotta do something.

832
01:49:34,232 --> 01:49:35,192
Damn!

833
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:38,472
Hey!

834
01:49:38,552 --> 01:49:40,192
Stop!

835
01:49:40,272 --> 01:49:41,152
Hey!

836
01:50:32,069 --> 01:50:33,869
I am no longer amused.

837
01:50:52,668 --> 01:50:55,069
You will die together.

838
01:51:09,268 --> 01:51:12,308
Give my regards to King Tut,
asshole.

839
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:26,339
-How much time do we have left?
-45 seconds.

840
01:54:26,379 --> 01:54:28,100
He's leaving. Turn it off.

841
01:54:28,139 --> 01:54:30,179
I'm trying to. I can't disarm it.

842
01:54:30,219 --> 01:54:31,019
What?

843
01:54:31,059 --> 01:54:33,259
I can't stop it.
They've got it rigged.

844
01:54:47,898 --> 01:54:50,018
I've got an idea.

845
01:57:07,932 --> 01:57:09,612
-I always knew you'd get us back.
-Yeah, right.

846
01:57:09,732 --> 01:57:11,092
Later.

847
01:57:13,812 --> 01:57:15,372
Thanks, Daniel.

848
01:57:23,612 --> 01:57:25,572
You sure you wanna do this?

849
01:57:25,651 --> 01:57:27,171
Yes. I'm sure.

850
01:57:28,211 --> 01:57:29,971
You gonna be all right?

851
01:57:32,971 --> 01:57:34,971
I'm gonna be all right.

852
01:57:35,291 --> 01:57:37,171
How about you?

853
01:57:40,611 --> 01:57:42,171
Yeah.

854
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:46,330
Yeah, I think so.

855
01:57:53,450 --> 01:57:56,290
Tell Catherine this brought me luck.

856
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:01,970
I will.

857
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:08,529
I'll be seein' you around.

858
01:58:10,369 --> 01:58:12,369
Doctor Jackson.

859
