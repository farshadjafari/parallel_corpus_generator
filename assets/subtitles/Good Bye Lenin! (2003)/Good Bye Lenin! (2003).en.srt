Our holiday home, Summer 1978

6
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:51,566
Look here. Here into the camera.

7
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:57,566
Hands off!

8
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,815
Alex, hold on!
- Dad, help me!

9
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,685
Slowly, cautiously,
almost gently...

10
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:38,476
the giant colossus...
is placed on the launch site.

11
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:42,517
Here on the launch site
the result of the great...

12
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:46,684
community work is demonstrated.
If you want an example to emphasize the famous word:

13
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:48,643
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

14
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:51,059
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

15
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:54,059
... here it can be seen in perfection.

16
00:02:56,059 --> 00:03:00,558
I report: I am ready for the flight
with spaceship SOJUS 31...

17
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,891
as a member of the international
crew.

18
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:08,475
On August 26, 1978,
we had reached international standing.

19
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:16,099
Sigmund Jähn, citizen of the GDR,
was the first German who ever went into space.

20
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,057
However, on this day our
family went really up in smoke.

21
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:21,057
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

22
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:23,140
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

23
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:26,307
He stands in for his boss, professor Klinger.

24
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,515
Do you know of any contacts in the West
your husband might have?. - No.

25
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:35,348
Mrs Kerner, how would you
describe the state of your marriage?

26
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:40,847
Has your husband ever talked to you
about escape from the Republic?

27
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,931
Mrs Kerner...
Has he talked to you about that?

28
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:52,347
Allow me to present the Central Committee
of the communist party...

29
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:56,388
Get lost! Leave me alone!

30
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,096
While Sigmund Jähn bravely represented the GDR
in the depths of space,

31
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:06,262
my procreator let a class enemy
in a capitalistic country...

32
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:09,762
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

33
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:10,054
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

34
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:16,929
My mother became so sad,
that she stopped talking.

35
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,762
She just didn't talk anymore.
Not to us, not to others.

36
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:34,636
Mum, please come back.
It's so boring at Mrs. Schäfer's.

37
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:39,594
Mum, I love you.

38
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:56,884
The Sandman excellently adapted to the
conditions in space.

39
00:04:56,926 --> 00:05:01,051
But the biggest surprise was that he
became very well acquainted...

40
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,093
...with Mascha.

41
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:07,093
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

42
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,550
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

43
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,050
In a few minutes, the sandman
and Mascha will come back to Earth.

44
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,549
I hope it was relayed,
so that you could see it clearly.

45
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:25,008
Mother came back after 8 weeks.
It was as if she had been transformed.

46
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:28,174
Surprise!
- My sweeties!

47
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:37,007
My Alex. My little cosmonaut.

48
00:05:57,964 --> 00:05:59,089
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

49
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,547
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

50
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:07,546
From this moment on, my mother got married
to our socialist Fatherland.

51
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,963
Our home...

52
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:18,171
is not only
the towns and villages...

53
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:22,380
As this relation was not a sexual one,
there was a lot of vigour and energy left...

54
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:26,462
for us kids
and the socialist daily routine.

55
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:32,212
... is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field and the birds...

56
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,545
in the air and the animals on the ground...

57
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:36,045
in the air and the animals on the ground...

58
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:40,045
My mother became promoter of
the progress of society.

59
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:44,544
A passionate activist for the
simple needs of the people

60
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:46,044
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

61
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,628
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

62
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,044
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

63
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:52,544
Concerning: Gaudily colourful...

64
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:55,543
maternity dresses. Full-stop.

65
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:05,001
And now a report on the solemn honouring...
- This is it!

66
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:05,876
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

67
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:09,043
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

68
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:13,043
artists and veteran workers
came to Berlin today,

69
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:18,042
to receive the highest honourings
of our country in the Council of State.

70
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:18,793
to receive the highest honourings
of our country.

71
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,750
That's you, Mum!

72
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:25,959
... and recognition of outstanding
merits during the building up...

73
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:30,375
and development
of the socialist social order.

74
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,583
On the eve of the
national holiday...

75
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,791
the CC of the SUG
traditionally rewards men and women of merit.

76
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:44,540
After a long, untiring training
it was time. I, Alex Kerner,

77
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,040
was the second German to go to space.
Deeper and further than any man before.

78
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Rocket launched!

79
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:57,581
I imaged how I would explore the riddles of the cosmos
for the good of humanity,

80
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:01,748
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

81
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,539
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

82
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,039
Rocket launched!

83
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:29,038
10 years later - October 7, 1989.

84
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,704
Test, one, two...

85
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,621
The GDR had its 40th anniversary.

86
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:39,788
I had a day off with the
PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"...

87
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:44,620
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

88
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,037
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

89
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,328
Left, two, three!

90
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,536
Time smelt of change,
while an oversized rifle association...

91
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:07,036
had its last performance
in front of our house.

92
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,535
Alex!

93
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,243
What?

94
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,785
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

95
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:30,034
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

96
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:33,034
Who is she?
- No idea.

97
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:36,034
But she makes a good impression.

98
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,784
Have you slept in your clothes again?

99
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:45,408
Where's the visitor?

100
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,574
The visitor's name is Paula...
and it's a date, as agreed. Here you are.

101
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,616
Oh no!
- Oh yes, little brother.

102
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:57,324
Can't your ex-boyfriend take care of her?
- He's on standby duty today.

103
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,532
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

104
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,406
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

105
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:24,073
... can't and won't wear the panties,
that are offered.

106
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:28,948
Fullstop. Even in the GDR, there
are not only young princesses on ice and...

107
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:33,155
exquisitly slim comrades. Full-stop.
- That's good.

108
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:34,780
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

109
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,530
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

110
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,530
Well hurry up then. It could be the last time
with these members.

111
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,029
Where's Paula?
- Yeah, where is she? Sleeping again?

112
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:47,029
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

113
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,655
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

114
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:53,570
You'll have to look for her with a magnifying glass.

115
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,862
I don't really know if I'll go there.
All of the party's bigwigs are there.

116
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:05,070
I don't know anyone. Although... I'd like
to see Gorbatschow at close range this once.

117
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:10,820
There they are celebrating themselves,
all the old bastards.

118
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:15,070
Well you don't have to watch.
- Mum, don't you notice what's happening there?

119
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:18,236
And you, what do you want? Do a bunk?

120
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:23,860
Nothing will change if
they all go away. Let's go on.

121
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:29,527
It cannot be possible,
that the stouter...

122
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,735
...workers and farmer's wifes...
are punished by the fashion combinates...

123
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,901
...after the 40th year of the existence
of our Republic!

124
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:40,943
With socalist salutations...

125
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,776
Hanna Schäfer.

126
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:56,525
In the evening of October 7, 1989
several hundred people united...

127
00:11:56,525 --> 00:12:00,525
for an evening walk,
to promote...

128
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:04,525
the idea of walking without borders.

129
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:08,149
Freedom of the press! Freedom of the press!

130
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:33,523
Cough! Cough hard!

131
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,398
Everything alright?

132
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:42,814
You alright?
- Thank you!

133
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,729
There're even more Greens.

134
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:00,688
Alright already!

135
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:06,354
Form a chain!

136
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:09,813
No violence! No violence!

137
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:17,229
You might make it
if you take the subway.

138
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,894
What's your name?

139
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,602
La...

140
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,642
Stop it!

141
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:17,392
Watch out!

142
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:39,890
That's my mum lying there!
- Stand still! - My mum's lying there!

143
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:56,973
Let me go, you asshole!
That's my mu......

144
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:29,804
Alexander Kerner?
- Yes?

145
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,928
Your mother.

146
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:35,050
What about mother?

147
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:41,133
What is it?

148
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,466
Mum had a heart attack.

149
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:50,799
Unfortunately, the resuscitation attempts were carried out
very late. Your mother's in a coma.

150
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:58,340
When can we talk to her?
- Alex, Mum's in a coma!

151
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:03,631
Mr. Kerner, we don't know yet,
whether or not your mother will ever wake up again.

152
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:39,046
Can you hear me, Mum?

153
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,796
You've got to wake up!

154
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:47,004
But mother was fast asleep.
In her deep, neverending sleep...

155
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:51,212
she circled like a satellite
around the events happening...

156
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:56,670
on our little planet
in our even smaller Republic.

157
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:03,003
The 9th Convention agreed to Honecker's request,
to relieve him of his duties...

158
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:08,003
because of health problems
and thanked him for his political life's work.

159
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,502
Congratulations!

160
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:11,502
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

161
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:13,918
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

162
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,876
General Secretary of the CC of the SUG
and Chairman of the GDR's council of state.

163
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,876
(Reporter) Berlin.
This evening the Wall fell.

164
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,334
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

165
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,501
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

166
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:37,084
Mother slept through a classical concert
at the City Hall of Schöneberg.

167
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:42,001
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

168
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:42,584
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

169
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,417
Open the gateway!

170
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,000
Stasi begone! Stasi begone!

171
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Mother kept on sleeping. Deeply and firmly.

172
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:02,499
She missed my
first trip into the West,

173
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:07,124
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

174
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:08,999
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

175
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:12,999
Of course she also missed my
first cultural discoveries

176
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,999
in a new country.

177
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,498
Excuse me, excuse me.

178
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:20,373
Excuse me, excuse me.

179
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:27,414
Mothers deep sleep didn't allow her
to participate in the first free polling.

180
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:31,497
Helmut! Helmut! Helmut!

181
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:35,997
She missed how Ariane gave up her study
of economic theory...

182
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:38,997
Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King.

183
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:43,289
... and made her first practical experience
with the circulation of money.

184
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:48,496
The sleep saved her the moving-in of Ariane's new boyfriend.
Rainer, class enemy and barbecue man.

185
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:51,705
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

186
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:54,496
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

187
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:58,495
She missed the increasing Westernization of
our 79-square-metre apartment...

188
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:02,996
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

189
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:03,537
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

190
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:12,494
... and Rainer's enthusiasm for the
oriental customs and way of life.

191
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,744
The big hormanal ecstasy
that I experienced watching

192
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:23,952
a few beautiful legs,
didn't reach into her night.

193
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:35,368
Shit!

194
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:45,784
What're you doing there?
- I... the infusion...

195
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:50,200
And not even the first day of Nurse Lara
exchange angel from the sovjet union,

196
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:53,492
penetrated her black dreams.

197
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:59,492
There you are again.
- Hello.

198
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:07,074
I was worried about you.
- They've put me in clink.

199
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:25,407
Mother overslept the triumph of
the capitalism. - Relief!

200
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:37,489
And the coordination of
my hospital visits.

201
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:05,446
Do you know what I noticed?
When she's in a good mood,

202
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:10,988
she's carrying her hair loosely.
When she's in a bad mood, she puts them up.

203
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,195
And during the doctor's round,
she chews on her fingernails.

204
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,695
Don't you think
she's got a beautiful smile?

205
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:27,111
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

206
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,902
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

207
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:33,902
The PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"
was winded up.

208
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:38,402
I was the last one
and I switched off the light.

209
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:42,944
Then there was the reprise. As a member of the
quick-witted East-West-Team, I applied the reunification very early.

210
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:47,110
Satellite dishes blossomed
in our landscape.

211
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,735
Denis Domaschke?

212
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:52,901
Domaschke. Denis Domaschke.

213
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:58,901
Alexander Kerner?
- Here.

214
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:01,401
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

215
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:02,234
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

216
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,942
Hi.

217
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:07,775
And get along, guys.

218
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:11,026
Hi.
- Hello.

219
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:19,567
Knut Vogel?

220
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:27,233
Hello, Mum. Doctor Wagner said
we should talk to you.

221
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:31,399
And if I can't be there in person,
I thought it might work like this too.

222
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:35,566
It's 5 o' clock now.
Most of the doctors are gone

223
00:23:35,608 --> 00:23:39,732
and you've finally got some peace.
Nurse Lara, who's washed you,

224
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:43,899
should be gone too. If you could see her
you'd surely wake up.

225
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,106
Ariane sends you her regards,
she thinks the idea with the tape is nonsense. Well, you know her.

226
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:53,273
She's just in the room taking care of Paula who's
getting her teeths and is screaming all the time.

227
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:57,439
Mother overslept my
unstoppable progress with Lara.

228
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,689
Our first romantic rendez-vous followed
4 early shifts and 35 late shifts.

229
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:28,271
It's loud here!

230
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:49,936
Our Russian teacher came from Minsk
and weighed a ton.

231
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:54,144
And that's all you know
about Russian women?

232
00:25:00,227 --> 00:25:04,351
The wind of change blew
into the ruins of our Republic.

233
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:08,518
Summer came and Berlin was
the most beautiful place on Earth.

234
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,684
We felt like
being in the center of the world.

235
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:17,351
Where finally something moved.
And we moved with it.

236
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:21,434
It's too bad she doesn't
realize any of this.

237
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:25,975
Well, maybe it's better that way.
Everything she believed in

238
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:29,100
has dissolved into air in a few months.
Just like that.

239
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:32,142
And your dad?
- He was a Doctor.

240
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:38,224
He escaped into the West.
We haven't heard anything from him again.

241
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:26,014
The future was in our hands,
uncertain and promising.

242
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:37,679
Good afternoon. We're X TV and we just wanted to...

243
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:41,471
Hello, do you need a satellite dish?

244
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:44,179
No money?

245
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:46,345
Good afternoon!

246
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:49,762
Do you like football? Then we've got something for you.

247
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:53,386
Good afternoon. We're X TV and...

248
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:57,553
We're X TV!
Are you interested in a satellite dish?

249
00:26:57,595 --> 00:27:01,803
This is Vietnam 1, there's Vietnam 2
and back there's the Viatnamese sport channel.

250
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:03,553
Alright!

251
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:12,635
To the World Cup!
- To the future! - To us!

252
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,886
Comrade!

253
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:28,259
At the moment this is just running
on the side.

254
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:34,384
And later...
I'll do real feature films.

255
00:27:37,384 --> 00:27:40,884
Same label of course.

256
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:42,383
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

257
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:44,092
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

258
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:50,175
That's what I'm working on at the moment. Watch this!

259
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:55,591
Don't look yet.
Don't look yet, wait...

260
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:59,633
And... now!

261
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:18,632
Recognized it?

262
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:32,756
Now!

263
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:41,297
That's the famous cut from 2001,
the one with the bone.

264
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,463
The cake represents the spaceship.

265
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:52,338
Got it now? Yes?
- Ingenious.

266
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:06,295
Ingenious.

267
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,711
Alright, everybody laugh.

268
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,378
Alright, everybody laugh.

269
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:19,377
At the beginning of June 1990, the borders
of our GDR were worthless.

270
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:28,710
Mother kept on sleeping. But I
remembered the old words of the comrades:

271
00:29:28,752 --> 00:29:32,919
"We solve problems by making headway"
and I acted.

272
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,333
Mum?

273
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,666
Mum!

274
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,374
Can you hear me?

275
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:28,832
Your mother's awakening is a wonder.
But she might not be the same person she used to be.

276
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:31,457
What do you mean?

277
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:35,706
There have been some cases in which
the patients didn't recognize their own children: amnesia.

278
00:30:35,748 --> 00:30:38,456
Loss of memory.

279
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:40,998
Sorry.

280
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,748
Mental confusion. Blending of
long and short-term memory...

281
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,914
Taste and smell irritations,
delayed perception. We don't know,

282
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:55,622
how badly the brain was damaged.
There are a lot of uncertain possibilities.

283
00:30:55,663 --> 00:31:01,705
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but mother is still in great danger.

284
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:07,621
I'm afraid I can't give you much hope
that she'll survive the next few weeks.

285
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:17,329
Well...

286
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,037
Can we take...
her home with us?

287
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:26,953
Out of the question.
She is in very good hands here.

288
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:31,578
It's also simpler for you.
She can't take another heart attack.

289
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,786
You have to keep your mother
away from any excitement, even any danger of excitement.

290
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:40,328
And I mean
any form of excitement, Mr. Kerner!

291
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:43,078
Any excitement.

292
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,118
It's life-threatening.

293
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:49,327
And this?

294
00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:51,369
And this?

295
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,369
Isn't this a reason to get upset?

296
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:58,868
My mother doesn't know anything about the Fall of the Wall.
She'll find out about that here immediately.

297
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:02,868
Your granddaughter.

298
00:32:02,868 --> 00:32:05,368
Your granddaughter.

299
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:07,867
Mummy.

300
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:15,367
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

301
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,034
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

302
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:19,700
8 months ago.

303
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,908
8... months ago?

304
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:29,366
I can't... remember.

305
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:34,324
That's normal. It will come back to you.
You just have to have patience.

306
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:37,366
And what... what happened?

307
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,782
Well, that was...
- It was October.

308
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:46,448
I think you wanted to go shopping.

309
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,740
And... there was a big queue in
front of the store. And it was so hot,

310
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,531
you just collapsed.
- In October?

311
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:59,530
It was a really hot October.
Back then.

312
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:02,073
Yes.

313
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:04,614
And then?

314
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:08,364
You were in a coma, Mum.

315
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:16,155
I want to go home.

316
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,363
That I promise you.

317
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:23,112
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

318
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:23,571
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

319
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:27,695
Alex, that's complete madness.
- We don't leave her alone, we promised her.

320
00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:31,904
Mum is fatally ill.
It's better for her here. They've got the equipment.

321
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:36,570
Just this once, be realistic.
- No, you be realistic.

322
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:40,903
What happens when she doesn't have a single room anymore?
Or when someone lets the cat out of the bag?

323
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:45,403
She'll hear what is happening outside in here.
She won't take it.

324
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,195
Alright, all of this rubbish has to come out.

325
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:57,152
Are mum's curtains still in the basement
- You can't be serious.

326
00:33:57,194 --> 00:34:00,194
They're rawlplugged.

327
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:03,860
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

328
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,360
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

329
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,860
Can you please tell me what he's doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

330
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,859
What should I think? - What should he think?
- That you have to make way.

331
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:16,360
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

332
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,193
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

333
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:21,359
Generous of you, Rainer! - For the whole apartment!
47,80 German Mark! In the West
that's not even enough for a telephone bill!

334
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,525
And in the East you have to wait 10 years to get a telephone connection!
- Can't you just...?

335
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:29,692
Mum has to find the room
in the same condition she left it in. The doctor said

336
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,858
she has to stay in bad okay?
So it's only about this one room.

337
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,733
And when she's better, we'll see what we'll do.
- You didn't get what the doctor said. Mum will probably...

338
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:42,942
That's what you said 3 months ago,
when you wanted to switch off the machines.

339
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:47,774
That was a different situation, you can't compare this!
- What do you want to tell her then, Ariane?

340
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:53,024
That you've given up your studies,
because you're selling Hamburgers now?

341
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:59,273
"Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King."

342
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:13,356
8th floor?.
- Yeah.

343
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:16,356
Elevator, hm?
- Broken. - Shit.

344
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:18,855
You can say that again.

345
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:54,603
My life changed drastically.

346
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:57,353
My life changed drastically.

347
00:35:57,353 --> 00:36:01,353
And the day we wanted to take mum home
was ever drawing nearer,

348
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:04,852
relentlessly like a big Russian tank.

349
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:06,852
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

350
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:09,311
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

351
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:14,685
And how do you look?
It would be nice if you would think a little for a change.

352
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:18,185
Look at this. This garbage is what we used to wear.

353
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,893
Sign here.

354
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:29,102
The physiotherapist is coming
3 times a week. Have you got any more questions?

355
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:34,309
Your mother is going at her own responsibility.
You know how I think about this.

356
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:37,434
Where is the previous Doctor, by the way?

357
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:41,642
Doctor Wagner, he went to Düsseldorf.
- I understand. And you?

358
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:46,683
When do you run away?
And you want to lecture me about responsibility.

359
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:54,683
Please lie down a second.

360
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:59,308
Why?
- Please. Just lie down.

361
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:12,723
If there's another cardiac arrest:
short, strong thumps on the chest.

362
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:18,431
Careful! She mustn't wake up.
- Alright, boss!

363
00:37:18,473 --> 00:37:23,014
Ariane and I'll set up a schedule.
And there's the physiotherapest.

364
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:26,223
There's always someone with her. It'll work.

365
00:37:26,264 --> 00:37:30,931
Most GDR citizens already exchanged
their savings cashlessly.

366
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:35,098
There are only 2 weeks left.
You should hurry. Because as Gorbatschow once said:

367
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:38,222
He who is late...
- Excuse me?.

368
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:41,347
will be punished all his life. - I can't hear it anymore.
- Excuse me!

369
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:45,514
Could you tune down the radio please?
My mother needs rest.

370
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,263
Alright, boss.

371
00:37:52,513 --> 00:37:57,929
Don't you want to introduce us?
- Oh yes, of course. This is Lara.

372
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,054
Hello, Lara.

373
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,678
Could you let me past, please?

374
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:23,386
Hello, Christiane!

375
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Alex! What is it?

376
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,802
Hello? Alex!

377
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:44,718
Nothing's changed in here.

378
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:49,051
What should have changed?

379
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:53,218
Oh, if you're bored,
you can listen to cassettes.

380
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,384
I'm afraid the radio receiver is broken.

381
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,676
But I'll repair that.
- Alex?

382
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,967
It's good to know
you're not alone.

383
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:14,383
When your father...

384
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:20,757
When he was suddenly gone...

385
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:26,132
I didn't think I'd make it.

386
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:33,923
I never told you that...

387
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,131
I thought about laying hands upon myself.

388
00:39:47,422 --> 00:39:50,548
But you visited every day.

389
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:55,005
And you talked about school and Sigmund Jähn.

390
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,130
You heard that?

391
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:05,879
I'm sorry to cause you so much work.

392
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:09,921
I can't even use the toilet by myself.
- Mum.

393
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:13,337
That doesn't matter.

394
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:17,629
The important thing is for you to get well.

395
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:20,754
I'll try hard.

396
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,254
You have to rest now.

397
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:30,628
I'll just go to the shop,
but Ariane is still there.

398
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:34,419
Oh, Alex...?

399
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:39,002
I'm craving for Spreewood gherkins.
Can you fetch me some?

400
00:40:39,044 --> 00:40:41,585
No problem, Mum.

401
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:45,794
That's what I thought.

402
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:53,835
At the end of June 1990 the shops of
our socialist Fatherland were emptied.

403
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:58,751
Real money was coming in from the country
behind the Wall.

404
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:06,543
While most citizens queued in long lines in front of the
Republic banks with their usual patience...

405
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:09,417
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

406
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:12,834
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

407
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:28,833
Yearned for by everyone, the German Mark flooded
our little community.

408
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:32,374
Halleluja, Halleluja...

409
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,541
Halleluja, German Mark!

410
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,374
(Song) Such a day, so wonderful...

411
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:44,165
And the money was exchanged 2 to 1.
Germany won 1:0!

412
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:49,790
Unstoppable shot!
Germany is one-nil up by Lothar Matthäus!

413
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,330
Mocca Fix? - Haven't got that anymore.
Filinchen Crispbread? - Not for sale anymore.

414
00:42:08,497 --> 00:42:12,580
Spreewood gherkins?
- Goodness, where do you live, boy?

415
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:17,163
We've got the German Mark now. And there you come
asking for Mocca Fix and Filinchen?

416
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:22,579
Over night, our grey store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

417
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,122
Over night, our store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

418
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:26,746
And I became the king as a customer.

419
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:29,538
They're from the Netherlands.

420
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:36,870
Good afternoon, Mr. Ganske.

421
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:50,328
That's how far they've driven us already...
that we have to go fishing in the garbage.

422
00:42:51,245 --> 00:42:54,869
Mister Ganske,
have you still got Spreewood gherkins?

423
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:57,911
What?
- Spreewood gherkins!

424
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:02,369
I'm sorry, young man.
I'm unemployed myself.

425
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:07,202
An empty glass would do, too.

426
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,908
I wanted to introduce Rainer to Mum today.

427
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:39,992
Later.
We don't want to demand to much of her.

428
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:47,907
Perhaps you're right.

429
00:43:49,074 --> 00:43:50,699
Yes.

430
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:56,157
I'm afraid there was a supply shortage
for Spreewood gherkins.

431
00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:59,490
It's alright. These are fine too.

432
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:07,948
Listen, you really don't have to take
care of me all the time.

433
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,990
It's awkward for me.
- Mum.

434
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,115
No, really. Maybe...

435
00:44:14,573 --> 00:44:19,656
... you could put the TV next to the bed.
Then I'll manage by my own.

436
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:23,905
Watching TV still is too tiring for you.
- But why? Why shouldn't I...

437
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:29,863
be able to watch TV?
- We'll ask the Doctor.

438
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:35,321
Mum, we have to talk to you about something.

439
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:38,405
It's like this...

440
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,612
We wanted to ask you if...

441
00:44:41,654 --> 00:44:46,445
We need your authorization to access your bank account.
- What is it?

442
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:50,903
Do you need money?
- No. No.

443
00:44:52,612 --> 00:44:56,736
It's just that you can't go walk
the bank by yourself anymore.

444
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,903
And it would simply be better if...

445
00:45:00,403 --> 00:45:03,486
you sign this.

446
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:06,236
Yes, and...

447
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:09,278
maybe now would be best.

448
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:17,194
But there's no hurry is there?

449
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:25,776
You're keeping something from me?
Has something happened? Are you in debt?

450
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:28,943
Please trust us, it's important!

451
00:45:28,985 --> 00:45:35,442
Before I let you have all my money,
I have got a right to know what it's for don't I?

452
00:45:35,484 --> 00:45:37,359
All right.

453
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,733
It was supposed to be
a surprise but...

454
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:45,942
We received a notification.

455
00:45:46,234 --> 00:45:49,025
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

456
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:50,733
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

457
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:53,233
After only 3 years?

458
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:57,233
And for that we need the money
that you've saved.

459
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,150
You don't think...
I got my money at the bank?

460
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:11,023
I've hidden it.

461
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:14,731
And where?
- Where?

462
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:24,523
I forgot.

463
00:46:26,773 --> 00:46:30,939
I've totally forgotten, it's all gone.
- Mum, just think.

464
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:45,230
Father is coming home late today,
don't you think?

465
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:12,103
Mum...

466
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:18,520
That's alright.
Soon you'll be better again.

467
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:24,936
We'll celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

468
00:47:26,394 --> 00:47:31,185
With the house community.
We have always celebrated it.

469
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,309
This is the First German Television
with the news.

470
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:45,393
Comrade Ganske watches West-TV?

471
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:54,934
Comrade Ganske fell in love.
During a vacation in Hungary.

472
00:47:54,976 --> 00:47:58,101
With a pensioner from... Munich.

473
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:02,183
Since then his love for the party has suffered.

474
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,225
Oh.
- Well...

475
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,683
Are you finished?

476
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:17,224
I'm sorry I'm late again.
- There it is. Even with a balcony.

477
00:48:17,266 --> 00:48:19,433
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

478
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,224
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

479
00:48:21,224 --> 00:48:25,724
the apartment market in the Capital eased considerably.

480
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:29,724
There were deserted apartments everywhere,
which we only had to enter.

481
00:48:29,724 --> 00:48:31,724
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

482
00:48:31,724 --> 00:48:33,890
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

483
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,803
Get a load of that! - Get a load of that
- It's working! - Tempo-beans!

484
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,720
Globus green peas!
That can't be true.

485
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,219
Mocca Fix Gold!
I've been looking for that all the time!

486
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:56,801
Can I have that?

487
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,008
I have to go.

488
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:38,591
Sleep on...

489
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:05,547
Morning, Mum.

490
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:08,297
Morning, Alex.

491
00:51:09,672 --> 00:51:12,797
Are you in a hurry?
- I have to go to work.

492
00:51:12,881 --> 00:51:15,838
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

493
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:17,213
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

494
00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:23,213
Oh and about my birthday.
Invite Klapprath and perhaps a few pupils.

495
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:27,212
As if the fucking gherkins weren't enough trouble already.
Now she wants to watch TV.

496
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:31,504
What should I do?
- Yeah, Houston. We got a problem.

497
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:37,795
Yeah, and now? - I thought you might have an idea.
No, I meant the picture.

498
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,503
Oh.

499
00:51:45,086 --> 00:51:47,628
Now?
- Nope.

500
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:52,836
It didn't work very long.
- Semi-finale! I'll just go over to the Pollnicks.

501
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:55,586
Then go already.

502
00:51:56,794 --> 00:52:00,669
Excuse me.
Are those gherkins from the Spreewood?

503
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:03,252
Nope, from the Netherlands.

504
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:09,210
Just show her something old.
- What do you mean?

505
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,169
Old East-TV stuff on video tape.

506
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:16,793
News from last year? She'll notice for sure.

507
00:52:16,835 --> 00:52:21,501
Ah, I don't think so. It was always the same rubbish.
- Where should I get the videos from?

508
00:52:21,543 --> 00:52:25,126
I haven't even got a recorder.
- Bad enough.

509
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:26,876
What's the score?

510
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:27,375
What's the score?

511
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:32,208
Beckenbauer, Rudi Völler...
You don't want to see it...

512
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,417
Germany made it into the finale!

513
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:44,499
While the world time clock at the Alexander Square
rushed towards mother's birthday,

514
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:48,666
a tiny round ball united the social development...

515
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:52,832
of the split nation and let things, that belonged
together, grow together.

516
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:57,291
I slaved away like a Hero of Labour to resurrect
the GDR in every detail

517
00:52:57,332 --> 00:53:01,498
in mother's room until this day.

518
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:05,707
Have the cross-word puzzles already been solved?
- Untouched like a virgin.

519
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,748
Great. I'll take them all.

520
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:12,789
Oh and these ones too.

521
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:19,706
They laid my daughter off too.
All of a sudden it was: "Thank you, and goodbye."

522
00:53:19,706 --> 00:53:24,205
And for that we worked for 40 years, oh leave me alone......
They'll even drop the TV ballet.

523
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:26,205
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

524
00:53:26,205 --> 00:53:27,122
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

525
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:31,289
To get back to my mother. The problem is that

526
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:35,496
she doesn't know about the Fall of the Wall
- Enviable.

527
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:42,538
And it's her birthday next week.
She would really be happy about a visit.

528
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:48,454
Have you really got it now?
I don't want to hear one false word.

529
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:51,579
And our 20 Marks?
- The work comes first.

530
00:53:51,621 --> 00:53:56,287
The first guests were invited.
Others still had to be persuaded.

531
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:00,454
A lot of people of the Polytechnical Secondary School
"Werner Seelenbinder"...

532
00:54:00,494 --> 00:54:04,620
had withdrawn to their private lives.
Including Doctor Klapprath.

533
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:05,911
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

534
00:54:05,911 --> 00:54:08,202
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

535
00:54:08,202 --> 00:54:11,703
We were all valuable people.

536
00:54:11,703 --> 00:54:14,202
Isn't that right, Alex?

537
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:18,202
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

538
00:54:18,202 --> 00:54:20,785
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

539
00:54:20,827 --> 00:54:23,827
And an excellent human being.

540
00:54:24,076 --> 00:54:27,201
That's why she was neutralized.

541
00:54:29,493 --> 00:54:33,243
Some comrades in the collective
thought her to be too...

542
00:54:34,327 --> 00:54:37,035
idealistic.

543
00:54:37,242 --> 00:54:39,951
Ever since your father...

544
00:54:42,284 --> 00:54:45,409
Her idealism was well-respected, but...

545
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:51,533
in the daily school routine, it...
can become problematic sometimes.

546
00:54:52,366 --> 00:54:55,491
And then you simply gave her the boot.

547
00:55:00,908 --> 00:55:04,657
You still owe her something.
- Yes.

548
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:14,699
You're a Dispatcher. Can you remember that?
- Dispatcher? In the East?

549
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:19,199
Yes, of course in the East. You organize the
purchasing of a Mitropa-Restaurant.

550
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,199
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

551
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:23,615
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

552
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:27,948
And you were Group Council Chairman with
the Pioneers. - Group Council... what?

553
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,072
Group Council Chairman.
- That's enough.

554
00:55:31,114 --> 00:55:37,323
I won't use those plastic diapers anymore.
That's going too far.

555
00:55:38,114 --> 00:55:41,238
Got it?
Yes, Group Council Chairman.

556
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,655
Here you are, 30 broadcasts of "Current Camera",
10 broadcasts of "Black Channel"...

557
00:55:45,697 --> 00:55:49,821
6 broadcasts "Colourful Boiler" and 4 broadcasts of
"A Day in the West". It's all copied.

558
00:55:49,863 --> 00:55:53,988
Sponsored by the country's picture library
and a very charming Denis.

559
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,654
I hope that'll work.

560
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:05,488
What are you doing crawling on the ground?
- That's the cable for the antenna so you can watch TV?

561
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:20,028
We've got the World Cup. Truly a gift.
There is no better time to

562
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:23,195
supply satellite dishes to the East.

563
00:56:24,028 --> 00:56:27,153
Okay? Got it? We come to phase 3...

564
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:37,569
What was that?
- No idea. Interferences, happens from time to time.

565
00:56:37,777 --> 00:56:41,902
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to the "Current Camera".

566
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:47,610
Hard provocation against the border.
Protests in the Chancellor's office in the FRG (West Germany).

567
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:51,776
Chip-Power GDR.
The foreign press acknowledges achievements...

568
00:56:51,817 --> 00:56:55,942
Things are running outside
and I feel so useless in here.

569
00:56:55,984 --> 00:57:00,109
Can't you put a note on the house community's
pin board?

570
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:05,233
Whoever's got any problems can come to me.
I can write inputs from bed.

571
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:09,442
I don't know.
You shouldn't exert yourself.

572
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:15,691
Morning, Alex. Is it time already?

573
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:27,940
You want a swig? You want a swig?
- Oh holy shit!

574
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:33,899
Shit. Shit, yes? Shit!

575
00:57:34,273 --> 00:57:37,398
Goodness, goddamn shit!

576
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:55,189
I feel sick.

577
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,272
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

578
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:04,688
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

579
00:58:04,688 --> 00:58:08,188
sounds from the past
came out of mother's bedroom.

580
00:58:08,188 --> 00:58:13,188
Our home
is not only the towns...

581
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:14,687
and villages...

582
00:58:15,687 --> 00:58:20,854
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

583
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:23,645
Our home...

584
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,978
is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field...

585
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:32,853
and the birds...

586
00:58:33,103 --> 00:58:38,394
in the air and the animals on the ground...

587
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:44,645
and the fishes in the river are the home...

588
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:47,602
And we love the...

589
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,560
That was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, children.

590
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,559
You learned that from me, didn't you?

591
00:59:04,851 --> 00:59:06,517
Yes.

592
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,975
Dear Christiane!

593
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:16,142
We are here... today... here,

594
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:20,309
because it's your birthday.
And... I would like to wish...

595
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,767
you all the best
in the name of the party direction.

596
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:29,433
And...

597
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:32,682
the basket.

598
00:59:35,016 --> 00:59:36,891
For you.

599
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,933
That's kind of you. Thank you.

600
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:44,807
Klapprath.

601
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:48,599
Rosenthaler Kadarka... Mocca Fix Gold...

602
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:52,973
Globus green peas.

603
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:57,223
The colleagues and... the comrades...

604
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:02,805
of the POS "Werner Seelenbinder"... they...

605
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:08,181
would like to thank you in particular
for all the years,

606
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:12,139
Christiane, that you... were...

607
01:00:14,263 --> 01:00:17,263
a... good colleague...

608
01:00:17,971 --> 01:00:20,971
and... a dear comrade...

609
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:25,471
uhm...

610
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:31,387
And anyway, I wish you all the best
for your birthday and remain the same person you are...

611
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:33,512
Christiane.

612
01:00:41,803 --> 01:00:44,803
Dear comrade Kerner...

613
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:48,928
All the best...

614
01:00:49,386 --> 01:00:52,094
and... good health...

615
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:56,427
and that everything will be
as it used to be again.

616
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:02,844
Lara, come here.

617
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:10,052
This is Lara.

618
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:13,344
An exchange student from the Soviet Union.

619
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:17,426
Her dad is a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

620
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:22,551
Don't marry him too early.
- Mum.

621
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:27,009
Even though the thing with the flat
will work out earlier then.

622
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:32,509
My Alex can be
a real block-head sometimes.

623
01:01:34,717 --> 01:01:37,425
And Rainer...

624
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:41,342
that's my Ariane's new boyfriend.

625
01:01:41,925 --> 01:01:44,925
He... he is a...

626
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:49,299
Dispatcher.
- Right, I'm a Dispatcher.

627
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:55,132
I used to be with them myself...
All the best from the heart... Pioneers!

628
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:59,299
I used to be with the
Free German Pioneers...

629
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,673
Thank you, Rainer.

630
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:04,423
As a Group... um...

631
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,715
Cha...

632
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:10,048
Group Chairman... back then...
- Thank you!

633
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:15,547
Be ready, be ready!
- Thank you, Rainer!

634
01:02:19,422 --> 01:02:23,589
Yes, Mum. Another year is over.
What's changed?

635
01:02:24,714 --> 01:02:29,506
Not much really.
Paula got her teeth and a new dad.

636
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:32,713
And me... yes.

637
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:37,171
Unfortunately, we cannot go over to
the Café Moskow to drink to your health,

638
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:41,171
but we're all together.
And that's the most important thing.

639
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:45,171
We didn't always make it easy for you,
but you were always there for us.

640
01:02:45,463 --> 01:02:49,587
And, by any rate, I can't think of
a better family than ours.

641
01:02:49,629 --> 01:02:54,253
And that's what I wanted to thank you for.
Mum, you're the best mother in the world.

642
01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:57,379
Alex?
- And we all love you.

643
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,128
Alex?.
- What's the matter?

644
01:03:00,545 --> 01:03:03,253
What's that?

645
01:03:05,753 --> 01:03:08,836
That's...
- Yes, what's the meaning of that?

646
01:03:08,878 --> 01:03:13,002
I don't know what the comrades are doing there again...
A fata morgana.

647
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:18,461
That's from the West.
- It's a mirage.

648
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:27,251
It will have been approved somehow.
- Please calm down, Mum!

649
01:03:27,293 --> 01:03:30,418
There's an explanation for everything. Right...

650
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:35,251
Boys, please sing something, will you?

651
01:03:35,584 --> 01:03:38,709
Lara! Wait a moment, I... Lara?.

652
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:44,250
"Build up, build up".

653
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:48,376
What's the matter all of a sudden?

654
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:53,583
Build up.
For a better future...

655
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,625
we build up our home...

656
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:02,166
I'm sorry for your mother.
What you're doing is too scary for me.

657
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:08,749
And what is this nonsense
about my father being a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

658
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:12,999
He was a simple cook, you know that.
- But she rejoiced in that.

659
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:18,457
What should I've told her?
That he's dead? In her state?

660
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:25,748
You mean to say, when you're lying already,
it doesn't make any difference anyway.

661
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:29,581
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

662
01:04:29,623 --> 01:04:31,498
Lara!

663
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:35,956
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

664
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,997
three cheers for her!

665
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:42,538
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

666
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,330
Just a little further away.

667
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,372
Just a little further away.

668
01:04:56,871 --> 01:04:59,163
Just a little more..

669
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:03,329
Watch out, will you? We're filming here!
- Can I see your authorization?

670
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:07,120
Didn't he inform you?
- Me? Who?

671
01:05:08,162 --> 01:05:11,246
Oh, what was his name?
- Something with "M".

672
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:15,453
I'll just go and ask around.
Until then, you don't film anything!

673
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,828
Got the logo? - Yes.
Sharpness on me?- Yes.

674
01:05:24,411 --> 01:05:28,536
We're waiting for the evening sun.
- Don't overdo it, the guy will be back soon.

675
01:05:28,577 --> 01:05:32,661
Just you wait.
With the evening sun it'll look brill.

676
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,285
When I stared at the clouds on that day,
I realized that the truth

677
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:41,452
was just a doubtful matter,
that I could adapt to mother's

678
01:05:41,494 --> 01:05:42,452
familiar surroundings.

679
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:44,327
familiar surroundings.

680
01:05:45,826 --> 01:05:49,826
I only had to study the language
of "Current Camera"...

681
01:05:49,826 --> 01:05:53,825
and spur on Denis' ambition
as a film director.

682
01:05:55,909 --> 01:06:00,617
Today Günther Mittag, secretary for Economy
in the CC of the SUD,

683
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:05,200
visited the Coca Cola group in West Berlin.
The reason for the comrade's visit are...

684
01:06:05,242 --> 01:06:10,075
details of the completed
trade agreement between Coca Cola...

685
01:06:10,116 --> 01:06:13,242
and the VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig.

686
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:18,491
Security officers of West Berlin hinder
the work of the GDR television.

687
01:06:18,533 --> 01:06:22,658
Surely, the capitalistic press
censors find the loss the mighty

688
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:26,241
Coca Cola group has suffered against the
VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig...

689
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:30,407
in the patent procedure too embarrassing...
Please let the GDR television

690
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:34,573
work undisturbed!
- That's it, I'm calling the police!

691
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:38,740
A testimonial of international
scientists now finally confirmed

692
01:06:38,782 --> 01:06:42,906
to the Collective Combine,
that the original Coca Cola flavour

693
01:06:42,948 --> 01:06:48,198
was developed in the 50s
in laboratories of the GDR. Back to the studio.

694
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,989
Coca Cola is a socialist drink?

695
01:06:52,322 --> 01:06:55,906
I thought, Cola existed before the war.

696
01:06:55,947 --> 01:07:00,072
Don't you understand, Mum?
The West ripped us off all these years!

697
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:04,239
Until the end of August
593 deaths by drugs were registered.

698
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,446
60% more than in the year before.
- Now I remember!

699
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:13,738
What?
- Where I hid the money.

700
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:18,321
In the living room. In the small chest of drawers.

701
01:07:18,363 --> 01:07:21,946
In the left drawer
under the wax paper.

702
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:25,612
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste.

703
01:07:25,654 --> 01:07:28,779
How could I forget?

704
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:37,611
Hey, here I am!
- Oh, hello!

705
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:42,778
And?

706
01:07:44,736 --> 01:07:48,319
Has she swallowed it?
- Yes, of course. - Really?

707
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:52,527
Has she really swallowed it?
- I'm telling you.

708
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:00,026
They've driven us this far!
- Good evening, Mister Ganske.

709
01:08:01,068 --> 01:08:04,151
They betrayed us and sold us out!

710
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:07,776
The lack of sharpness didn't irritate her?
- No.

711
01:08:07,818 --> 01:08:11,943
And for that we worked 40 years...
- We could rebuild a studio.

712
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:16,150
We would have different possibilites
with a blue box.

713
01:08:16,275 --> 01:08:18,983
What... what are you doing there?

714
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:39,316
And? What should we do with it?
- Exchange it, of course.

715
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,315
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

716
01:08:43,315 --> 01:08:45,148
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

717
01:08:45,857 --> 01:08:49,981
But it's a special case.
- We've only just found it today.

718
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:54,148
It's even okay for us,
if you exchange 1 to 4 or 1 to 5...

719
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:58,815
I'm afraid there is no prolongation.
And we wouldn't have exchanged cash anyway.

720
01:08:58,856 --> 01:09:01,940
That can't be!
- It has to be possible!

721
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:06,106
I'm sure you heard me. Time's up!
- Your time is up soon, you bastard!

722
01:09:06,147 --> 01:09:10,272
These are 30,000 East Marks! That was our money,
for 40 damned years!

723
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:14,438
Now you Western fuck want to tell me,
this isn't worth anything?

724
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:18,230
Please leave our premises now.

725
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:21,772
Keep your hands off! And what are you all gawking at?

726
01:09:22,313 --> 01:09:25,313
It used to be your money, too!

727
01:09:27,938 --> 01:09:30,938
Keep your hands off! You assholes!

728
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:40,437
Are you going mad or what?

729
01:09:41,062 --> 01:09:45,187
I felt like a Commander
of a submarine in the Northsea-Fleet,

730
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:49,353
whose battle-hardened steel skin
had sprung a leak.

731
01:09:49,395 --> 01:09:53,520
Everytime I closed a leak,
another one opened.

732
01:09:53,561 --> 01:09:57,686
Ariane denied being my brother in arms,
the class enemy raised his Cola-flag

733
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:03,144
and a fresh wind from the West
blew mother's East money around my ears.

734
01:10:05,644 --> 01:10:08,769
What're you laughing about?
- Yell.

735
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:11,977
Why?
- You have to vent some air.

736
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:15,434
Open up your valves. Just yell!

737
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:48,183
In Summer 1990, the German
national team exceeded the plan...

738
01:10:48,225 --> 01:10:52,224
and became World Cup holder.

739
01:10:52,432 --> 01:10:55,474
And mother kept on getting better.

740
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:55,890
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

741
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:59,807
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

742
01:10:59,807 --> 01:11:03,307
and the length of a "Size 38". Full-stop.

743
01:11:03,307 --> 01:11:08,306
I don't know how the employees
of Milena come to these measurements.

744
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:14,473
In the Capital there are no people who
are so small and square. Full-stop.

745
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:19,472
Christiane, that's good.

746
01:11:20,514 --> 01:11:25,305
If it's our fault...
If it's... our fault...

747
01:11:26,889 --> 01:11:33,097
that we cannot accommodate the Central Plan
with our sizes, comma...

748
01:11:33,763 --> 01:11:37,513
we would like to apologize for that. Full stop.

749
01:11:37,721 --> 01:11:41,847
In this case...
we shall endeavour to become, comma...

750
01:11:41,888 --> 01:11:46,054
in the future, smaller and
squarer. Full stop.

751
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:51,138
With socialist salutations.

752
01:11:51,637 --> 01:11:53,720
Hanna Schäfer.

753
01:11:58,554 --> 01:12:00,762
Hello, Mrs. Schäfer.

754
01:12:00,804 --> 01:12:06,470
Oh Alex. It's so nice to talk to your mother.
It feels just like living in the past.

755
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:10,636
A little changes here and there
and I'll send it to the OTTO mail-order company.

756
01:12:13,636 --> 01:12:15,845
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

757
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:17,802
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

758
01:12:17,802 --> 01:12:20,302
Our home...

759
01:12:24,802 --> 01:12:28,301
I've got some nice visitors.
That's Frank and Christian...

760
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:31,301
of my former class.
- Hello.

761
01:12:31,343 --> 01:12:35,385
Hello.
Mrs. Kerner has to rest now, alright?

762
01:12:36,343 --> 01:12:39,343
Bye.
- Alex, why?

763
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:45,676
Now scram!
- And the 20 Marks? - What 20 Marks?

764
01:12:45,717 --> 01:12:49,883
Sascha said,
we'd get 20 Marks for that!

765
01:12:50,092 --> 01:12:54,217
Hello, Mr. Mehlert. - Hello, Alex.
Problems with the toaster?

766
01:12:54,259 --> 01:12:58,716
My mother will be happy,
just go ahead. And you get out of here!

767
01:12:58,758 --> 01:13:04,174
And tell your mates, I don't want to see a Pioneer here ever again. - Alright, boss.

768
01:13:09,882 --> 01:13:12,966
Have you gone nuts?

769
01:13:13,007 --> 01:13:17,132
You can't just let the
boys in here!

770
01:13:17,173 --> 01:13:20,257
But why? She was pleased, wasn't she?

771
01:13:20,298 --> 01:13:26,506
You can't do anything right with you Easties!
Having something to complain about is what matters to you most!

772
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:30,673
You're just like your mother
and her stupid GDR-inputs.

773
01:13:30,715 --> 01:13:32,756
My mother doesn't grumble!
She's trying to change

774
01:13:32,798 --> 01:13:36,922
the conditions of the society step by
step through constructive criticism. - Sure.

775
01:13:36,964 --> 01:13:40,047
And you were never interested in that!
- Nope.

776
01:13:40,089 --> 01:13:44,755
Haven't you noticed?
We're in the socialist veteran's club.

777
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:48,422
Good evening.
Why don't you take admission fees?

778
01:13:48,463 --> 01:13:50,547
Yeah, let's charge admission fees!

779
01:13:50,588 --> 01:13:55,171
You be quiet.
He's bought a Trabbi (GDR car). - Really?

780
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:57,088
An estate car.

781
01:13:57,296 --> 01:14:01,421
That can't be happening. Paula will get a defect,
if this goes on much longer. - Oh come on!

782
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:05,045
20 years in the GDR didn't harm
our health, did they?

783
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:08,212
I've really got my doubts about you.

784
01:14:08,754 --> 01:14:11,462
Shit. Shit!

785
01:14:16,628 --> 01:14:19,336
Well done. Get a cloth.

786
01:14:34,794 --> 01:14:37,919
What is it? Nosebleeds again.

787
01:14:44,168 --> 01:14:48,294
I know it's a little stressful at the moment
I'd also prefer,

788
01:14:48,335 --> 01:14:53,751
if we didn't have to...
- I saw dad... earlier.

789
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:57,710
Where?.
- At work.

790
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:02,418
I recognized his voice immediately.

791
01:15:02,542 --> 01:15:05,167
What did he say?

792
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,458
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

793
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,292
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

794
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:17,292
Um, 3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise!

795
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:35,415
And... what does he look like?

796
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:42,707
He drives a Volvo estate car and
got glasses with a golden rim.

797
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,582
What did you tell him?

798
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:52,914
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

799
01:15:56,163 --> 01:16:00,330
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

800
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:30,162
My father lived somewhere in this City.
I saw his image in my mind.

801
01:16:30,203 --> 01:16:36,412
A fat guy who stuffed himself with cheeseburgers
and chips all day.

802
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:47,703
He lived in his world and I lived in mine.

803
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:51,910
He didn't have anything to do with me
and I didn't have anything to do with him.

804
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:04,118
Hold still or it won't work.

805
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,285
Will it take much longer?

806
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:14,659
'cause I have to be home
in 2 hours at the latest.

807
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,617
You always have to be somewhere in 2 hours.
It's getting boring.

808
01:17:21,451 --> 01:17:25,575
Oh great. I got a sick mother,
a demanding job...

809
01:17:25,616 --> 01:17:29,741
and a miffed girlfriend.
- I've got my exams in 2 days.

810
01:17:29,783 --> 01:17:33,950
It's second nature to you.
This little bit of putting a plaster on.

811
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,241
Then I can stop learning, can't I?

812
01:17:38,866 --> 01:17:43,032
I was well-meant.
I believe in you.

813
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:46,824
Lara, stop this shit, please!

814
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:49,990
You have to tell your mother!
- What?

815
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:55,240
You have to tell your mother!
- Not because of me, but because of her!

816
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:01,906
Lara!
- What?

817
01:18:02,573 --> 01:18:05,281
Shit! Lara!

818
01:18:19,196 --> 01:18:23,780
The life in our little country
became ever faster.

819
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:29,280
Somehow we were all just like atoms
in a big particle accelerator.

820
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,779
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

821
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:33,279
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

822
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:39,529
silence and leisureliness,
where I could finally have a lie-in.

823
01:18:41,154 --> 01:18:47,362
Well, Paula. Alex didn't use to be
so tired when he came home from work.

824
01:18:55,028 --> 01:18:58,153
Our Paula's learning to walk, Alex!

825
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:05,694
There! There!

826
01:19:25,693 --> 01:19:27,359
There!

827
01:19:32,192 --> 01:19:35,318
See? I can do it, too.

828
01:19:45,275 --> 01:19:47,983
Paula! See?

829
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:55,691
My little Paula. Come to your Granny.
Come, come.

830
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:04,357
Now we'll show Alex,
what we can do, okay?

831
01:20:04,982 --> 01:20:06,857
Right...

832
01:20:13,398 --> 01:20:17,565
Now let's see just how far
your Granny can walk.

833
01:21:10,936 --> 01:21:13,644
Hi! - Hi!
- Good afternoon.

834
01:21:26,727 --> 01:21:30,351
Young man,
can I just sit down for a moment here please?

835
01:21:30,393 --> 01:21:33,101
Of course.

836
01:21:41,226 --> 01:21:45,309
You're not from here, are you?
- Nope, from Wuppertal.

837
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,434
From the West?

838
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,430
Mum?

839
01:23:59,342 --> 01:24:02,468
Mum, what are you doing? Come on.
- Mum!

840
01:24:03,509 --> 01:24:09,425
What is it with you?
You can't just get up! Shit.

841
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:16,383
What's actually happening here?

842
01:24:20,175 --> 01:24:24,341
Central Committee of the Socialist...
Unity Party of...

843
01:24:25,632 --> 01:24:28,341
Germany.

844
01:24:29,341 --> 01:24:32,341
Sound is in order.
- Right.

845
01:24:32,674 --> 01:24:36,257
Right. I'm ready.
- Camera running.

846
01:24:36,299 --> 01:24:38,382
3, 2, 1...

847
01:24:40,423 --> 01:24:42,423
Berlin.

848
01:24:51,922 --> 01:24:53,964
Still running.

849
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,881
Berlin.

850
01:24:56,089 --> 01:25:01,172
In a historic special session of the
Central Committee of the Social Unity Party of Germany...

851
01:25:01,213 --> 01:25:06,213
the General Secretary of the SUG's CC
and Chairman of the GDR's Council of State,

852
01:25:06,255 --> 01:25:10,546
Comrade Erich Honecker, in a great matter of humanitarian politeness,

853
01:25:10,588 --> 01:25:17,421
consented to the entering of the country by people from the FRG
who've been requesting exile at the GDR embassies in Prague and Budapest.

854
01:25:17,463 --> 01:25:19,504
In this development, Honecker sees...

855
01:25:19,546 --> 01:25:21,962
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

856
01:25:21,962 --> 01:25:23,920
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

857
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,921
a welcome money of 200 East Marks.

858
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,921
Unemployment,
bad future prospects...

859
01:25:30,921 --> 01:25:34,920
and the increasing election victories
of the neo-Nazi Republicans...

860
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:39,295
made the unnerved FRG citizens
turn their backs

861
01:25:39,337 --> 01:25:43,461
on the capitalism to
try and start...

862
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:47,252
a new life in the country of workers and farmers.

863
01:25:49,753 --> 01:25:53,793
Here they park,
the new GDR citizens from the FRG.

864
01:25:53,919 --> 01:25:58,044
The entering FRG citizens
were accommodated in the Berlin districts...

865
01:25:58,085 --> 01:26:02,209
"Center" und "Friedrich's Grove".
The CC of the SUG...

866
01:26:02,251 --> 01:26:07,834
created the campaign "Solidarity West"
because of the historic situation,

867
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:12,626
to make sure all the new citizens
receive proper living space.

868
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,792
Somehow I have to admit
that my game started to break free.

869
01:26:16,834 --> 01:26:20,959
Maybe the GDR I created for my mother,
was the one I would have liked to have.

870
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,125
Citizens who are ready
to accommodate a refugee from the FRG,

871
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:29,833
please report to their
Section Plenipotentiary.

872
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,750
How many are there already?

873
01:26:35,124 --> 01:26:38,124
I don't know. Ten, twenty thousand?

874
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:42,832
Look at that.
The people want to come into our country.

875
01:26:42,874 --> 01:26:46,999
Where are they all going to live?
- They'll find something.

876
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:50,165
You've heard it, they're taking care of it.

877
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:55,665
No, children. This is our responsibility.
We have to help.

878
01:26:56,415 --> 01:27:01,207
But how do you think we can?
I mean, there's no room left in here.

879
01:27:02,748 --> 01:27:05,873
Our holiday home.
- Our holiday home?

880
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:12,164
We could do it up.
I wanted to get out there anyway.

881
01:27:12,872 --> 01:27:19,330
Congratulations. You've done a great job.
Now she wants to go to the holiday home.

882
01:27:20,872 --> 01:27:24,996
You'll have to redecorate the entire City.
Why don't you start?

883
01:27:25,038 --> 01:27:29,205
But I'm telling you one thing,
I won't take this any further.

884
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:37,496
Ariane and I'll get a bigger apartment.
In 4 weeks we're out of here.

885
01:27:37,537 --> 01:27:39,913
What?

886
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:42,662
I'm pregnant.

887
01:27:47,787 --> 01:27:51,953
Again?
Can't you be more careful?

888
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,244
Don't you think Paula is enough? And Mum?

889
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:03,369
You can't leave me alone!
- Then take some refugees.

890
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:07,577
You're so cynical.
You want her to die, don't you?

891
01:28:17,035 --> 01:28:22,451
And so the unity of our little
family was restored.

892
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:28,076
That's your child. And this is the heart.

893
01:28:33,618 --> 01:28:36,326
Amazing!

894
01:28:36,825 --> 01:28:39,992
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

895
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:41,408
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

896
01:28:41,408 --> 01:28:45,408
were signed.
In Moskow, they calculated

897
01:28:45,408 --> 01:28:51,408
that 2 and 4 equals one and drank
Krim Champagne to all-German brotherhood.

898
01:28:51,657 --> 01:28:57,075
In Berlin we took our
first all-German trip.

899
01:29:00,366 --> 01:29:04,491
I'm not a little child anymore.
Please take off the cloth.

900
01:29:04,532 --> 01:29:07,240
Don't look!

901
01:29:07,907 --> 01:29:12,074
Where are we going?
- The surprise stays a surprise!

902
01:29:12,865 --> 01:29:16,989
The Trabbi (GDR car) smells so new.
What colour does it have?

903
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:22,198
You've waited 3 years,
another half an hour won't make a difference. - That's right.

904
01:29:54,363 --> 01:29:56,237
Mum?

905
01:30:11,903 --> 01:30:15,402
Oh, it's beautiful. Sky-blue.

906
01:30:15,402 --> 01:30:18,402
Right, and now turn around.

907
01:30:22,277 --> 01:30:26,110
Oh my god. The garden.

908
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:30,401
Remember the time Alex
locked himself in the bathroom?

909
01:30:30,401 --> 01:30:33,401
We knocked and knocked. Not a sound.

910
01:30:33,401 --> 01:30:34,902
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

911
01:30:34,902 --> 01:30:37,735
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

912
01:30:37,777 --> 01:30:41,943
And I laughed so hard,
I wet myself.

913
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:53,692
What's happened in the 8 months
I overslept?

914
01:30:53,734 --> 01:30:56,442
Is she asleep? - Yeah.

915
01:31:00,317 --> 01:31:04,483
You've become adults,
that must be it.

916
01:31:05,233 --> 01:31:07,025
You look more and more like your father.

917
01:31:07,025 --> 01:31:08,399
You look more and more like your father.

918
01:31:16,899 --> 01:31:18,398
Mum...

919
01:31:18,607 --> 01:31:22,732
I've lied to you all this time.
It's all different from what you think.

920
01:31:22,774 --> 01:31:25,898
Mum, what are you talking about?
- Your father...

921
01:31:31,106 --> 01:31:35,273
Your father didn't stay in the West
because of another woman.

922
01:31:35,981 --> 01:31:40,147
I lied.
And I also lied about...

923
01:31:44,314 --> 01:31:47,314
not hearing anything from him again.

924
01:31:47,897 --> 01:31:51,022
He wrote letters to me... and to you.

925
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:55,980
They're all... in the kitchen cupboard.

926
01:32:03,146 --> 01:32:07,938
They made things so hard for him.
Just because he wasn't in the party.

927
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:12,771
It was dreadful.
He didn't let anyone notice.

928
01:32:14,103 --> 01:32:17,103
But I knew.

929
01:32:17,229 --> 01:32:21,394
I... knew
and I couldn't help him.

930
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:29,102
And then... there suddenly was
this congress in West Berlin.

931
01:32:30,686 --> 01:32:34,436
We only had 2 days to think.

932
01:32:35,811 --> 01:32:39,811
Your father wanted to stay in
the West and I...

933
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:42,977
I was supposed to follow with you.

934
01:32:47,435 --> 01:32:50,560
Well, I couldn't do it.

935
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:56,935
I... I was very frightened.

936
01:32:58,893 --> 01:33:03,017
You don't know, how it is.
Filling in an exit permit...

937
01:33:03,059 --> 01:33:07,600
with 2 children. You can't get out immediately.
You have to wait - endlessly!

938
01:33:07,642 --> 01:33:10,767
Sometimes even years. And you...

939
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:16,016
They could have taken you away from me.
Do you understand?

940
01:33:22,641 --> 01:33:25,641
Yes.

941
01:33:26,808 --> 01:33:29,933
I didn't go.

942
01:33:32,307 --> 01:33:35,932
It was the worst mistake of my life.

943
01:33:35,973 --> 01:33:38,681
I know that now.

944
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:43,765
I lied to you. Please forgive me!

945
01:34:05,888 --> 01:34:08,888
My dear Robert...

946
01:34:10,846 --> 01:34:13,971
I thought about you so often...

947
01:34:15,971 --> 01:34:19,721
I would so much like to
see you once more.

948
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:03,593
The same evening
mother's condition suddenly worsened.

949
01:36:12,964 --> 01:36:17,172
Your mother had another heart attack,
just as I feared.

950
01:36:17,214 --> 01:36:21,380
At the moment, she's relatively stable.
But I'm afraid...

951
01:36:23,172 --> 01:36:27,338
we have to expect the worst.
I'm sorry.

952
01:36:34,921 --> 01:36:39,046
The doctors can be wrong.
- Alex, don't lie to yourself.

953
01:36:39,088 --> 01:36:43,128
Here, I found it.
He lives in Wannlake.

954
01:36:45,962 --> 01:36:52,170
I know, it's her last wish.
But I couldn't bring myself to go there.

955
01:36:55,878 --> 01:36:58,878
Mum's not going to die.

956
01:37:02,461 --> 01:37:04,336
Bye.

957
01:37:43,416 --> 01:37:47,166
Now you can accommodate someone after all.

958
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:52,791
Accommodate? Who?

959
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:56,041
Someone from the West.

960
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:22,498
You have to sleep.

961
01:38:25,331 --> 01:38:29,372
If you want you you can sleep
lie down in the nurses' room.

962
01:39:08,537 --> 01:39:11,662
There he was. The idol of my youth.

963
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,370
Like a conjured spirit
from my childhood: Sigmund Jähn.

964
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:16,703
Like a conjured spirit
of my childhood Sigmund Jähn.

965
01:39:16,703 --> 01:39:22,202
He didn't give autographs, he didn't
talk to Pioneers about the secrets of the universe,

966
01:39:22,202 --> 01:39:26,202
the freedom you have in zero gravity
or the eternity of the cosmos.

967
01:39:26,369 --> 01:39:31,535
He drove a small, stinking Lada-Taxi.
- Where do you want to go?

968
01:39:31,576 --> 01:39:34,660
To Wannlake.
- I know what you're thinking.

969
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:38,743
That's what many people think.
But that's not who I am.

970
01:39:38,868 --> 01:39:42,992
We were flying through the night.
Just like through the depths of the cosmos.

971
01:39:43,034 --> 01:39:47,159
Light-years away from the solar system,
past strange galaxies...

972
01:39:47,201 --> 01:39:51,367
with unknown lifeforms,
we landed in Wannlake.

973
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:54,784
Could you wait a moment?

974
01:39:58,283 --> 01:40:00,992
I won't be long.

975
01:40:11,282 --> 01:40:14,282
Good evening.
- Hello. Come in.

976
01:40:17,824 --> 01:40:21,573
Is Mr. Kerner there?
- The buffet is outside. - Over there.

977
01:40:27,532 --> 01:40:30,240
Hello.

978
01:40:39,489 --> 01:40:41,155
Good evening.

979
01:40:47,614 --> 01:40:49,489
Hello! Good evening!

980
01:40:53,197 --> 01:40:55,072
Hello!

981
01:41:01,154 --> 01:41:07,154
Sandman, dear Sandman,
it isn't time yet...

982
01:41:07,196 --> 01:41:11,570
We send the evening greetings...

983
01:41:11,988 --> 01:41:15,445
before all the children have to go to bed.

984
01:41:15,529 --> 01:41:16,445
You surely have time left.

985
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:18,696
You surely have time left.

986
01:41:21,695 --> 01:41:25,195
Hello.
- Hello. - Hello.

987
01:41:25,195 --> 01:41:28,695
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

988
01:41:28,695 --> 01:41:29,236
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

989
01:41:29,278 --> 01:41:31,986
Alexander.

990
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:41,652
Look,
today the sandman is an astronaut.

991
01:41:42,152 --> 01:41:45,277
Where I come from it's called cosmonaut.

992
01:41:45,318 --> 01:41:49,360
Where do you come from?
- From a different country.

993
01:41:52,193 --> 01:41:55,277
Hi, you little bears.
- Hello, Dad.

994
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:58,317
Hello. How are you?

995
01:41:58,484 --> 01:42:01,192
Fine.

996
01:42:03,734 --> 01:42:06,859
So, are you also a fan of the Sandman?

997
01:42:06,942 --> 01:42:09,650
Yes, I am.

998
01:42:13,441 --> 01:42:17,608
Excuse me, do we know each other?
- Yes, we do.

999
01:42:18,983 --> 01:42:22,733
Yes. I can't think of it.
Please help me.

1000
01:42:23,149 --> 01:42:25,858
His name's Alexander.

1001
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,107
Alex?

1002
01:42:38,524 --> 01:42:43,690
Robert. Robert!
We're all waiting for you out here.

1003
01:42:43,731 --> 01:42:46,314
Robert, come out!

1004
01:42:46,356 --> 01:42:50,981
Robert, we all know that you like to hide
in the bathroom on these occasions.

1005
01:42:57,189 --> 01:43:01,605
Dad, you have to give your speech.
- Robert, come out here.

1006
01:43:01,647 --> 01:43:04,647
I'll be back.

1007
01:43:09,772 --> 01:43:13,938
Oh, I see him.
You've kept us waiting.

1008
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:18,230
Onto the stage!

1009
01:43:23,187 --> 01:43:27,687
Well, I thank you
all for coming here.

1010
01:43:27,687 --> 01:43:30,187
Thank you and...

1011
01:43:32,187 --> 01:43:33,687
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1012
01:43:33,687 --> 01:43:35,437
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1013
01:43:45,727 --> 01:43:49,853
I'm sorry for having this
party here tonight.

1014
01:43:49,894 --> 01:43:53,644
Had I known you'd come, I...

1015
01:43:57,185 --> 01:44:01,310
Strange, I've always thought you've got
a swimming pool.

1016
01:44:01,352 --> 01:44:07,268
We've got a lake nearby.
My god, I didn't even recognize you.

1017
01:44:13,851 --> 01:44:17,600
Now I got 2 new brothers and sisters, hm?

1018
01:44:26,350 --> 01:44:31,725
For 3 years, every day I waited
for a message from you.

1019
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:33,641
Every day.

1020
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:38,850
It was my most fervent wish.

1021
01:44:50,016 --> 01:44:53,016
Why have you come?

1022
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:01,640
Mum's dying.

1023
01:45:02,889 --> 01:45:05,889
She had a heart attack.

1024
01:45:06,681 --> 01:45:09,681
She wants to see you once more.

1025
01:45:26,346 --> 01:45:29,471
What was it like up there?
- Up there?

1026
01:45:33,846 --> 01:45:36,555
Oh... up there.

1027
01:45:39,429 --> 01:45:42,429
It was wonderful up there.

1028
01:45:43,054 --> 01:45:46,178
Just very far away from home.

1029
01:45:52,803 --> 01:45:56,970
The Wall is no more.
There's no frontier!

1030
01:45:57,845 --> 01:46:00,469
It's not that bad.
It's all just one country now!

1031
01:46:01,261 --> 01:46:05,428
I don't understand a word. It's all untrue.
- That's why you have to play along.

1032
01:46:06,344 --> 01:46:09,428
And why did I come back to the GDR?

1033
01:46:09,469 --> 01:46:13,219
I don't know. Just think of something!

1034
01:46:16,927 --> 01:46:20,051
No, it's absurd. I can't do that.

1035
01:46:20,093 --> 01:46:24,884
You just have to overcome it,
then it'll be easy.

1036
01:46:50,091 --> 01:46:52,800
Mum.
- Yes.

1037
01:46:53,216 --> 01:46:55,091
Ouch.

1038
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:24,298
I want to get up.

1039
01:47:24,798 --> 01:47:27,506
How do I look?

1040
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:39,839
You can go in now.

1041
01:47:42,505 --> 01:47:46,255
And please remember, not a word!
- Yes, yes.

1042
01:47:56,588 --> 01:48:02,004
What did you talk about?
- Is that important?

1043
01:48:17,378 --> 01:48:21,544
How long has he been in there?
- More than an hour.

1044
01:48:25,919 --> 01:48:29,043
I hope he doesn't let the cat out of the bag.

1045
01:48:32,169 --> 01:48:38,085
The summer was over. I decided to end
the whole sham.

1046
01:48:38,418 --> 01:48:43,376
But once more we were about
to celebrate the anniversary of our socialist Fatherland.

1047
01:48:43,418 --> 01:48:48,126
But in contrast to reality...
as a dignified farewell.

1048
01:49:01,751 --> 01:49:03,375
Pst!

1049
01:49:12,499 --> 01:49:15,624
Yes? Camera running. Start at 3.

1050
01:49:21,874 --> 01:49:27,040
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1051
01:49:27,082 --> 01:49:31,206
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1052
01:49:31,248 --> 01:49:33,873
from the depths of the cosmos...

1053
01:49:45,664 --> 01:49:50,080
As mum hardly couldn't wait,
we simply moved the GDR's anniversary...

1054
01:49:50,122 --> 01:49:55,538
from October 7 to October 2, 1990:
The eve of the reunification.

1055
01:50:17,162 --> 01:50:18,829
And?

1056
01:50:19,245 --> 01:50:22,370
Here. My best film yet, buddy.

1057
01:50:22,579 --> 01:50:26,703
Too bad no one but your mother
will ever see it.

1058
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:30,870
Thank you, Denis. Without you, it would never...
- Yeah, it's alright. Here you go.

1059
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:34,036
Zoom off, before it gets sentimental.

1060
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:37,119
And tell me how it was!

1061
01:50:37,161 --> 01:50:42,411
On the occasion of today's annual anniversary of the GDR,
Erich Honecker resigned...

1062
01:50:42,452 --> 01:50:45,452
from all his functions.

1063
01:50:45,618 --> 01:50:47,285
What?

1064
01:50:47,368 --> 01:50:51,702
We ensure our friends in the world
that the socialism...

1065
01:50:51,744 --> 01:50:55,868
(Reporter) In his speech on the ceremony for
the GDR's anniversary...

1066
01:50:55,909 --> 01:51:00,035
in the Republic's palace, Erich Honecker
justified his decision by saying that

1067
01:51:00,076 --> 01:51:04,200
the changes achieved in the GDR in the past few months...

1068
01:51:04,242 --> 01:51:08,367
completed his political life's work.
Erich Honecker congratulated...

1069
01:51:08,409 --> 01:51:13,575
the new SED's CC General Secretary and
Chairman of the GDR's council of state:

1070
01:51:13,617 --> 01:51:16,617
Sigmund Jähn.
- What, Jähn?

1071
01:51:16,742 --> 01:51:22,158
In 1978, Sigmund Jähn was the first German
cosmonaut in space.

1072
01:51:22,783 --> 01:51:28,199
The new head of state addressed the
GDR's population in the evening.

1073
01:51:30,074 --> 01:51:36,282
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1074
01:51:36,532 --> 01:51:40,657
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1075
01:51:40,699 --> 01:51:46,115
from the depths of the cosmos,
you see things differently.

1076
01:51:47,365 --> 01:51:49,740
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1077
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:51,656
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1078
01:51:51,656 --> 01:51:57,156
seem small and insignificant. You ask yourself
what humanity has accomplished.

1079
01:51:57,156 --> 01:52:01,655
Which objectives did we set,
which objectives did we realize?

1080
01:52:01,864 --> 01:52:04,947
Today is our country's anniversary.

1081
01:52:04,989 --> 01:52:08,780
It's a very little country,
seen from the cosmos.

1082
01:52:08,822 --> 01:52:12,946
But still thousands of people
came to us last year.

1083
01:52:12,988 --> 01:52:18,280
People who we looked to as enemies and
who want to live here with us today.

1084
01:52:18,322 --> 01:52:23,362
We know our country is not perfect.
But what we believe in,

1085
01:52:23,404 --> 01:52:27,529
inspired a lot of people
in the whole world.

1086
01:52:27,571 --> 01:52:31,695
Maybe we have drifted off course
from time to time.

1087
01:52:31,737 --> 01:52:35,862
But we collected ourselves.
Socialism doesn't mean

1088
01:52:35,904 --> 01:52:40,528
living behind a wall. Socialism means
reaching out to others,

1089
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:45,236
and living with others. Not just to dream
about a better world,

1090
01:52:45,278 --> 01:52:47,320
but to make the world a better place.

1091
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:49,153
but making it a better world.

1092
01:52:49,153 --> 01:52:53,153
I have therefore decided
to open the GDR borders.

1093
01:52:54,652 --> 01:52:58,652
Shortly after the Fall of the Wall,
thousands of FRG citizens...

1094
01:52:58,903 --> 01:53:03,693
seized the opportunity
to visit the GDR for the first time.

1095
01:53:08,194 --> 01:53:12,318
Many want to stay. They're looking
for an alternative to...

1096
01:53:12,359 --> 01:53:17,526
the hard battle for survival in the capitalistic system.
- Isn't that wonderful?

1097
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:21,692
Not everyone wants to join in with career addiction and
aggressive marketing.

1098
01:53:21,734 --> 01:53:25,901
Not everyone wants
to fight his way through life.

1099
01:53:30,066 --> 01:53:34,108
(Song) Such a day,
so wonderful like today...

1100
01:53:34,733 --> 01:53:39,025
These people want a different life.
They realize that cars,

1101
01:53:39,066 --> 01:53:44,066
video recorders and TVs are not everything.
They are ready to

1102
01:53:44,107 --> 01:53:50,024
realize a new life with nothing but
good will, vigour and hope.

1103
01:53:55,274 --> 01:53:57,149
Amazing.

1104
01:55:10,061 --> 01:55:13,810
My mother survived the GDR
by 3 days.

1105
01:55:14,227 --> 01:55:18,352
I guess it was the right thing,
that she never did learn the truth.

1106
01:55:18,393 --> 01:55:21,393
She died happily.

1107
01:55:22,976 --> 01:55:27,101
She wished for us to
scatter her ashes to the four winds.

1108
01:55:27,143 --> 01:55:33,060
That's not allowed in Germany.
Not in the West and not in the East. But we didn't care.

1109
01:56:08,182 --> 01:56:12,515
Up there she is floating and
maybe she is looking down at us.

1110
01:56:12,557 --> 01:56:16,681
And sees us as tiny
dots on our little Earth.

1111
01:56:16,723 --> 01:56:19,848
Just like Sigmund Jähn back then.

1112
01:56:21,931 --> 01:56:28,139
The country my mother left
was a country she had believed in

1113
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:32,680
and which we kept alive
until her last second.

1114
01:56:33,555 --> 01:56:37,722
A country that in fact never existed like this.

1115
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:45,639
A country that in my memory
will always be connected to my mother.
