1
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:18,948
Arturo, son.
Hurry, I have to get going.

2
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,314
- How many are left?
- Three.

3
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,006
Lau, hurry, sweetie.
I'm gonna be late.

4
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,436
They're ready.

5
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,744
Dad, I've decided to go for it.

6
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,353
I don't think I want you to go.

7
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:59,191
Come on, Dad. I've always been
responsible. I won't let you down.

8
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:02,157
I'm not sure. I just don't like
that environment for you.

9
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,797
Have some faith in me, Dad.

10
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,026
Little man, come here.

11
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,635
You're gonna have to get to school
on your own today.

12
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,704
When you get back, lock yourself in.

13
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,773
Where are you going?

14
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,966
I'll see you tonight.

15
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,074
What time will you be back?

16
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:23,273
Late!

17
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,931
Lau! Lau!

18
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:50,736
Girl, what are you doing there?
I've been looking for you.

19
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:54,176
And what's with those rags?
Where's your dress?

20
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:56,747
Let's go. Hurry, the line is super long.

21
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,782
Do you know what the grand prize
will be?

22
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,420
What are you talking about?
What fucking prize?

23
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:05,217
- For the winner!
- What winner?

24
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,722
The pageant, girl.
Do you know what she gets?

25
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,193
No, what?

26
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:14,299
She has to have sex
with one of those old, rich guys.

27
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,368
Where do you come up with that
kind of crap? Come on, let's go.

28
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,102
Your entry forms?

29
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,372
I spoke to Luisa.
She wanted to see my friend.

30
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:30,539
- Name and phone number?
- Laura Guerrero.

31
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,185
- Phone number?
- 638-3279.

32
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:35,412
I'm not sure you can go in.
You're very late.

33
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,889
No, wait. I was here earlier.
Someone's holding my place in line.

34
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,369
Hey, you can't cut in line.
What's your problem?

35
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,736
Chill, girl.
Someone's holding my place in line.

36
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,070
You can't cut, you bitch.

37
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:01,805
Oh, whatever, calm down.
I was already here, don't get crazy.

38
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,780
- Stand in line like everyone else.
- Calm down. Just drop it.

39
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:08,114
- You can't cut!
- Calm down.

40
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,984
- Get back there...
- Suzu.

41
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,602
- Do you want in or not?
- Yes.

42
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:26,102
Okay, where's your dress?

43
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,206
You're supposed to be wearing it.

44
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,400
Go get changed. Quickly.

45
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:33,171
- Do you see that line on the floor?
- Yes.

46
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:35,007
Walk it.

47
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:38,548
As you're walking out, smile,
tell me your name, age...

48
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:42,882
...and say, "My dream is to represent
the beautiful women of my state."

49
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,887
Got it?

50
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:48,924
Okay. Hurry up, sweetie.

51
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,126
Come on.

52
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,748
My name is Laura Guerrero,
I'm 23 years old...

53
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:22,088
...and my dream is to represent
the beautiful women of my state.

54
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,490
Don't laugh.

55
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,995
Let me see your nails.

56
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:32,297
Oh, you have to fix them.
They look like my maid's nails.

57
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:35,431
Fine, you're in.

58
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:39,704
I want to see you both tomorrow, very early.
Seven o'clock a.m., ready to rehearse.

59
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,575
You got it. Thanks.

60
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,183
Thanks.

61
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:53,188
- For those of us who are fair-skinned.
- Oh, be quiet, blondie.

62
00:06:54,728 --> 00:07:00,928
Look at this dress, it's great.

63
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,400
I just saw this other one, it's prettier.

64
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,402
- What do you think?
- Wait.

65
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,200
- Lau.
- Hold on, I wanna watch this.

66
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:12,743
Why do you care what that girl does?
Pay attention. Lau.

67
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,472
You're going to like this one. Lau.

68
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:19,241
Fucking Javi is here.

69
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,717
- I've gotta go.
- What's that guy doing here?

70
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:25,221
- He wants to go to the Millennium Club.
- Thought we were going shopping.

71
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,087
- What do you want me to do?
- Tell him you'll see him later.

72
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,456
Girl.

73
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,165
Fine. Wait for me here.

74
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,494
Let me go tell him.

75
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:37,426
What's up, babe?

76
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,096
What the hell are you doing here?
Come on, let's go.

77
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:43,174
I'll pay you later.

78
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:19,978
I'm with Suzu, I think she's with Javi.

79
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,738
Go ahead.

80
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:36,887
Let her through. She's with Javi.

81
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,250
Suzu, what happened?
Why did you leave?

82
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,513
I've been looking for you.

83
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,257
Get over here.

84
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,919
Hey, hey! Don't touch her
like that, asshole!

85
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:11,427
What the fuck is wrong with you?

86
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:13,657
Let me go.

87
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:19,198
Okay, asshole, stop!

88
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,906
She's leaving, I'll take her out.

89
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:26,842
Don't come back.
She needs a fucking shower.

90
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,049
I'm sorry, Lau.

91
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:35,278
Lau, these guys have connections.
They can help us win the contest.

92
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:38,583
What kind of connections
are these assholes going to have?

93
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,004
Lau.

94
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:59,406
If you want me to,
I'll tell Javi we're leaving.

95
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,177
And we can go somewhere else.

96
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,602
Let's go. I'll meet you out front.

97
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,103
Wait for me at the door.

98
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,136
Let's move.

99
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,825
Do you recognize me?

100
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,934
Pick it up.

101
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,067
How many people are out there?

102
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:38,840
I don't know.

103
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,071
Okay, get out of here.

104
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:43,181
Keep your mouth shut.

105
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,343
<i>We're ready.</i>
<i>Everybody take their positions.</i>

106
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,050
Stay calm.

107
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:52,350
Nothing's going on here.

108
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,959
<i>No mercy, boss. No mercy.</i>

109
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:07,999
Suzu, let's get out of here!

110
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,802
Everybody on the floor!

111
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:12,967
Suzu!

112
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,979
- On the floor!
- Suzu!

113
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:20,614
Get him! Get him! Don't move!

114
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:22,982
Get those pigs! Get them!

115
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,646
Come on, come on, hurry!

116
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:33,791
Get the job done! Hurry, hurry!

117
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,508
Find the American!

118
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:54,584
Gather the bodies.
Come on! Put them together.

119
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:01,718
<i>- The cops are on their way.</i>
- Okay, boss, ready.

120
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,292
Ventura, bring the truck, hurry!

121
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,524
Parca, bring the other trucks out back.

122
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,725
Come on, come on, let's go.
Time's up!

123
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:13,030
The pigs are on their way.

124
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,972
Hurry, let's go. We're out of time!

125
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:20,441
<i>We're done. Over. Let's go.</i>

126
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,188
Hop on, hurry!

127
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:11,626
They're getting closer, move it!

128
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:15,198
Leave the rest of the bodies, let's go!

129
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,707
Fucking hurry! They're here, let's go!

130
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,338
Let's go!

131
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,701
Officer, my friend's inside!
Please let me in!

132
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:36,371
There's nobody inside. You have to go!

133
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,341
Ma'am.

134
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:41,649
Have you heard anything?

135
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,088
Me either.

136
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,930
Yes, I'll let you know.

137
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,292
Thanks.

138
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,509
What do you mean,
she didn't make it?

139
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,016
You're out. We're rehearsing.
We looked everywhere.

140
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,211
We got into some trouble.

141
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:52,118
- I don't know what else to say, you're out.
- It's not fair.

142
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,952
Look, sweetie, nothing's fair.

143
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,857
Take this as a lesson. You have to
be more responsible. Goodbye.

144
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,266
I'm sorry, Luisa.

145
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,570
Give me another chance.

146
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,866
Let me find her
and we'll come back, please.

147
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,810
Just leave.

148
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:25,717
Okay, ready, girls? From the top.

149
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:50,678
- I need your help.
- What's going on?

150
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,215
I can't find my friend.

151
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:55,411
- Where did you leave her?
- We were at the Millennium nightclub.

152
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:58,489
- When? Last night?
- Yes.

153
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:03,420
I do transit only. I can't help you.
Go to the police station.

154
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:07,663
No, wait, can you please
try to find her using your radio?

155
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,323
- Name?
- Mine?

156
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:12,835
- No, your friend's name.
- Azucena Ramos.

157
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,975
No, you have to go to the police station.

158
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,907
Come on, help me. Please.

159
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,377
Fine. Get in, quickly.

160
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,278
Tell me what happened.

161
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:32,455
We were just hanging out...

162
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,286
...and these people came.

163
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:39,723
- And then?
- They had guns...

164
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,365
...and they started shooting.

165
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:49,437
I think they took some people
in plastic bags.

166
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,701
- Wait a sec.
- I was scared.

167
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,004
Okay, give me a sec.

168
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,911
R-12, do you copy? R-12.

169
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:02,349
<i>- Copy.</i>
- I have a 38 on my hands.

170
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:06,924
She claims she was at yesterday's
incident, at the Millennium.

171
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,617
<i>I'll get right back to you.</i>
<i>Let me check with R-1.</i>

172
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:16,325
Yes, please. Check on it
and call me back. Thanks.

173
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,303
What were you doing there?

174
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,970
Wait.

175
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,676
Hello.

176
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,012
Yes.

177
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:38,423
Yes.

178
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,889
Correct.

179
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,028
I'm on my way.

180
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,687
Where are we going?

181
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:52,263
We're going just up ahead to the station.
They'll take down your statement.

182
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:57,207
I want you to testify
about everything you saw and heard.

183
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:01,309
What else did you see or hear?

184
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,240
It was very dark.

185
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,977
What's your name?

186
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,013
Laura.

187
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,182
Laura what?

188
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:17,054
Laura Guerrero.

189
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,700
Don't worry, Laura.

190
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,919
Wait right here.

191
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,023
I'll be back.

192
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:55,634
Don't move, I'm grabbing my lunch.

193
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,640
What are you looking for?

194
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:10,543
I'm looking for my friend.

195
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:11,808
What friend?

196
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:15,420
- She was with me at the Millennium.
- Check her out, make sure she's clean.

197
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:16,850
Sir, wait, what's going on?

198
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:21,049
Boss, that skinny chick
from the Millennium is here.

199
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,825
No.

200
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,493
Get over here. Get out.

201
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,255
- Sir, please, wait.
- Open the door.

202
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,421
No!

203
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,192
- Get her inside!
- Let me go!

204
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,529
Get her inside!

205
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:34,766
No!

206
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,078
Linito, we're on our way.

207
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,618
- Who sent you?
- Nobody, I came here on my own.

208
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:50,812
<i>What does she want?</i>

209
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,788
- What the fuck are you looking for?
- Sorry, I made a mistake.

210
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,393
- Let me go.
<i>- She's clean, boss.</i>

211
00:21:56,562 --> 00:21:59,895
I swear I won't say a word.

212
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,966
<i>- Sure it's the girl from yesterday?</i>
- Yeah, from the bathroom.

213
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,296
She came with Toñito,
looking for her friend.

214
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:09,066
- What the fuck are you looking for?
<i>- Go ahead. You know what to do.</i>

215
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,166
I'm sorry, sir.
I made a mistake, please let me go.

216
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:44,206
If I catch you lying,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

217
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:47,077
What's your name?

218
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,138
Laura Guerrero, sir.

219
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,350
Where do you live?

220
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,056
915 Angela Peralta.

221
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:00,123
Phone number?

222
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,727
638-3279.

223
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:07,423
Who do you live with?

224
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,901
With my dad and my brother.

225
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,631
What do you do for a living?

226
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:18,268
We sell clothes.

227
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:24,109
What were you looking for?

228
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,050
I went looking for my friend Suzu after
fighting with the people from the pageant.

229
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,018
What pageant?

230
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:33,854
Miss Baja.

231
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:41,497
Okay, Canelita.

232
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,298
Listen, Canelita.

233
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,568
Stay calm.

234
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:01,779
Okay, Canelita. I'm gonna help you.

235
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:07,284
But I need you to do something for me.

236
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:09,727
What do you say?

237
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,200
Do you know how to drive?

238
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,368
Well?

239
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,781
Cali.

240
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:39,287
Gather the crew.

241
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,688
<i>Okay, they're on their way.</i>

242
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,122
Hide.

243
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:55,200
Canelita, here are the keys.

244
00:24:55,774 --> 00:25:00,734
Stay down for a bit.
I'll be waiting for you outside, okay?

245
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:24,261
<i>Let's go. Hurry, hurry.</i>

246
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:08,969
Follow us, park where I tell you
and wait for us on the other side.

247
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:56,187
Hey, lady, get out of here.

248
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,533
Get her in, get her in!

249
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:11,767
- Block the street!
- Don't let anybody through. Get her inside.

250
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:17,405
- Cali, stand watch!
- Let's go! Don't let anybody else through.

251
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:21,951
Nobody else goes through!

252
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:27,224
Let's go, hurry!

253
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:37,393
<i>Clear out! Clear out! Let's move.</i>

254
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:40,902
Come and get it, pigs.

255
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:46,066
<i>Lino, we're clearing out.</i>
<i>Go down the main boulevard...</i>

256
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:48,940
You smoked them, Canelita.

257
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:54,982
Hey, man, see who's in charge
of that beauty queen thing.

258
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:58,987
We're gonna help her get in.

259
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,524
How does that sound, Canelita?

260
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:04,662
Come on, smile.

261
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,593
<i>The pigs are on Juarez Street.</i>

262
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:08,892
<i>Keep your eyes open, stand guard.</i>

263
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,797
They're goners, they left.

264
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,460
<i>Keep going, we're clear.</i>

265
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:18,940
What does a miss do,
aside from sitting on her ass all day?

266
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,304
She makes money.

267
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,778
What if I do get you in?

268
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,786
<i>Those on the right are with us,</i>
<i>they'll let you through.</i>

269
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,444
Any news on my friend?

270
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,419
Okay, we're going straight.

271
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:36,527
I'm working on it. Give me time.

272
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:39,061
<i>Keep going straight,</i>
<i>cross Defensores.</i>

273
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,131
<i>You got it. We're headed that way.</i>

274
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:42,960
<i>Through Anzures, do you copy?</i>

275
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:47,367
<i>Copy. We got a green light.</i>
<i>Let's move, let's go.</i>

276
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:50,906
<i>Keep going straight. It's clear.</i>

277
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:58,711
<i>Those on Serdan Street are with us.</i>

278
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:02,345
<i>I'll let you know when we move again.</i>

279
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:04,917
<i>We're staying here for now.</i>

280
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:21,003
Laura, we made a mistake.

281
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:24,433
I've signed you up. Here's your number.

282
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,404
And Suzu?

283
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:28,978
We're waiting for her.

284
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:32,275
I need you to fill in some info.

285
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,779
You're in, Canelita.

286
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:39,518
In a little while,
they'll bring your friend to you.

287
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:44,228
Buy yourself the nicest dress
you can find.

288
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:48,196
Parca here will drive you.
And later, you go to the hideout.

289
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,231
No, thanks.

290
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,235
I'm not asking you.

291
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,820
She was on the phone with someone.

292
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,263
Give me your phone.

293
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,432
Who did you call?

294
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:25,301
I sent a message to my friend.

295
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,303
I told you I was taking care of that.

296
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:32,242
I don't want you using your phone.

297
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:34,770
Give me another one.

298
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,107
How long has it been
since we used this one?

299
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:40,080
This one is old, it's clean.

300
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:47,456
I want you to take her to buy a dress.
Then take her to the hideout.

301
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,526
<i>You got it, boss.</i>

302
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,420
I'll call you later.

303
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:54,258
Okay?

304
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,888
- Is there another exit?
- Where are you going?

305
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,654
Sorry. Thanks.

306
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,317
Can I help you with something?

307
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,181
Hello.

308
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:27,514
I'm looking for a dress.

309
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,756
What's the occasion?

310
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,397
For a beauty pageant.

311
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,960
In our store, all of the dresses
are custom-made.

312
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:45,833
You won't find anything
under $1000.

313
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:48,343
Yeah, I have the money.

314
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:55,776
Here is the green one you liked.

315
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:01,255
- Thanks.
- Let me know if you need anything else.

316
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,540
Yes?

317
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,878
<i>Canelita, where are you?</i>

318
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,982
Here.

319
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,185
<i>Here, where?</i>

320
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,675
Everything okay? Do you need help?

321
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:52,571
I'm sorry.

322
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:11,145
I don't have anything!

323
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:12,612
I didn't do anything!

324
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,497
Go home.

325
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,952
Where were you?

326
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:21,558
- Where's Dad?
- In his room.

327
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:25,219
Where did you sleep?

328
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,489
With Suzu. Be quiet.

329
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,133
- Cover for me?
- Yes.

330
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:31,928
Open up.

331
00:36:57,929 --> 00:36:59,829
What's going on?

332
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:02,091
What's wrong, Lau?

333
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:05,063
Nothing.

334
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,607
Are you okay?

335
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,539
Yes.

336
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:15,537
Why did you go away?

337
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:17,613
<i>Also, during the operation...</i>

338
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:20,808
<i>... two members of the criminal group</i>
<i>La Estrella were captured.</i>

339
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:23,783
- Can you bring me something to eat?
- Yes.

340
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:28,358
<i>- Alias Lino, was able to escape,</i>
<i>his whereabouts...</i>

341
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,389
Little man, don't make noise.

342
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:34,521
<i>This is yet another run-in between</i>
<i>the police and this criminal group...</i>

343
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,760
<i>... that started after they were identified</i>
<i>as being responsible for leaving a vehicle...</i>

344
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:44,500
<i>... in front of the embassy</i>
<i>containing the bodies of an agent...</i>

345
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:50,046
<i>... a federal police officer</i>
<i>and a young woman, not yet identified.</i>

346
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:53,008
<i>It has been General Salomón Duarte's</i>
<i>primary agenda...</i>

347
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,618
<i>... after being named</i>
<i>chief of police for the state...</i>

348
00:37:55,787 --> 00:38:00,315
<i>... to combat the various criminal groups that</i>
<i>are taking over the state of Baja California.</i>

349
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:03,688
<i>Lino is thought to be one of</i>
<i>the most active criminals in this state.</i>

350
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:08,355
<i>He is suspected of being responsible for</i>
<i>a recent attack in the Millennium nightclub...</i>

351
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:11,297
<i>... where the lives of</i>
<i>12 officers and civilians were lost.</i>

352
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:32,186
Did you go to school?

353
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,755
No.

354
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:37,889
- Why not?
- He didn't take me.

355
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:42,032
What have you been doing?

356
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,665
Nothing.

357
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,871
What's that?

358
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:51,741
It's all I could find.

359
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,407
Thanks.

360
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,614
What happened to you?

361
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:02,685
I fell down.

362
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:06,355
Ouch, it hurts!

363
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:08,685
Don't laugh.

364
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,336
Arturo, get dressed.

365
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:38,180
Open the door, fucker!

366
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:47,513
Step back.

367
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:50,024
- Step back, motherfucker.
- Take anything you want.

368
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,458
- Where is Laura, motherfucker?
- Who is Laura?

369
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,962
Do you want to die?

370
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,122
Dad.

371
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,997
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
I know she's here.

372
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,968
You son of a bitch, where is she?

373
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,131
There's no one here, man.

374
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:05,935
Dad.

375
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,606
Go to your room.

376
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:12,276
Go on!

377
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,423
Turn off all the lights.

378
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:28,190
Nobody goes near the windows.

379
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,430
Wait, please.

380
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:32,330
Come on!

381
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,905
Arturo!

382
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:40,310
Arturo!

383
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,810
Come with me.

384
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,946
Don't look back, okay?

385
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,617
Stay in here.

386
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:53,782
Everything is going to be okay.

387
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:02,264
Goddamn it.

388
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:09,436
Why the fuck did you run away?

389
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:12,739
Do you see what happened?
Fucking shit.

390
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,901
Who the fuck took your phone?

391
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,774
I don't know.

392
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:19,143
Go to your room.

393
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,948
How many of them were there?

394
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,252
Like six or seven.

395
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,919
What kind of trucks did they have?

396
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,591
Black ones.

397
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,860
What did they do to you?

398
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:43,369
They hit me and took the phone.

399
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:46,032
- What else?
- Nothing.

400
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:50,437
Move over.

401
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,951
Cover that lamp.

402
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:13,394
<i>- Linito, where you at?</i>
- Copy.

403
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:16,260
<i>They took all our ammo.</i>

404
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,402
<i>They also got Ventura.</i>

405
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:21,504
<i>We had to run.</i>
<i>They took over our hideout.</i>

406
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:10,147
Who the fuck did you go see?

407
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,179
Nobody.

408
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:16,520
Then why the fuck did you run away?

409
00:45:29,373 --> 00:45:31,898
Roquita. I'm in the clear.

410
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:35,274
<i>Everything is calm on this side.</i>

411
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:37,346
Got it.

412
00:45:38,015 --> 00:45:42,850
Cut the radios and start calling the U.S.

413
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:47,252
<i>All right, boss. We're fearless.</i>

414
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:31,533
I need you to run an errand for me.

415
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:40,043
Did you hear me?

416
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:41,678
Anything you want.

417
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:44,076
Just let my brother go.

418
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:49,117
You've got a deal.

419
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:54,617
We're in the clear.

420
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:56,089
<i>Jimmy, Jimmy.</i>

421
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,319
We want three boxes.

422
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:08,738
Ramón, open up.

423
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,102
I've packed up some things for you.

424
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:17,414
Don't say anything.

425
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:21,210
If something happens,
I'm going to pay for it.

426
00:47:21,385 --> 00:47:25,344
Wait, you go.
Tell them I'll stay in your place.

427
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:27,582
We can't do that.

428
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,751
Take this.

429
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:33,352
Don't be afraid, little man.

430
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,399
I love you.

431
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,187
Go on, leave.

432
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:01,882
Linito, the man and the kid are escaping.

433
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:03,048
Let them go.

434
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:05,923
The boss says they can leave.

435
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,661
Shut the fucking door!

436
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:25,579
Lino wants you in your room.

437
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,083
<i>General Duarte, in today's</i>
<i>press conference...</i>

438
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:33,485
<i>... gave a full report on the attack</i>
<i>against the criminal group La Estrella.</i>

439
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:37,184
<i>Something that can</i>
<i>only be classified as a lucky hit.</i>

440
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:40,888
<i>We've captured most members</i>
<i>of the criminal group.</i>

441
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:43,898
<i>We've taken most of</i>
<i>their weapons and ammo...</i>

442
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:48,334
<i>... and we expect to have all of them</i>
<i>captured before the weekend is over.</i>

443
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,375
Shut the door.

444
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:05,545
Take off your robe.

445
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:10,685
Put some clothes on.

446
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:33,277
<i>They've tapped our radios.</i>

447
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:37,318
I'm shutting down.

448
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:39,979
- Give me a holler when we are ready.
<i>- You got it.</i>

449
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:42,887
Tío. Keep an eye on Chiquirris.

450
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,722
I think he might be a rat.

451
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:49,024
<i>You got it, boss.</i>

452
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:00,673
That's enough.

453
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:04,073
Turn off the light.

454
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:23,232
Come here.

455
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:36,539
Lay down here.

456
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:58,427
Don't move.

457
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:02,168
Be still.

458
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,133
Hands up.

459
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:29,245
Put these on.

460
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:41,190
Tío. We're ready.

461
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,419
Call Jimmy,
we'll need three cases of bullets.

462
00:54:45,596 --> 00:54:48,622
Canelita. You're gonna
bring back a truck.

463
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,859
When you cross the border,
go under the bridge.

464
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:54,333
I'll be waiting for you there.

465
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:59,532
Take a good look at these monkeys.
Tell me who took your phone.

466
00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:06,141
This one.

467
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:16,017
Tío, we know who did it. Call the taxi.

468
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:48,919
<i>The gringo is waiting for her.</i>

469
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:56,556
Okay, we're here.

470
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:59,600
If they catch you with the money,
tell them you don't know me.

471
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,738
I have a family to feed.

472
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:11,108
- Where are you heading?
- To San Diego.

473
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,010
- Who sent you?
- Nobody.

474
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:15,708
- What's the purpose of your visit?
- I'm going shopping.

475
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:17,854
I need your passport.

476
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:28,859
Laura Guerrero, LG08714678.

477
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:32,263
<i>- She's clear, let her through.</i>
- Let her through.

478
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:37,330
Let her through, move the truck.

479
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:22,883
The chick got through.

480
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:27,148
Your passport.

481
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:37,189
Laura Guerrero, LG0871...

482
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:40,131
<i>She's clean, let her through.</i>

483
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:46,681
- Understand?
- Yes.

484
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:55,112
Stop, stop!

485
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:39,922
Hurry, they're hitting us hard!

486
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:45,256
Go get Canelita!

487
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:57,945
- Get down!
- Go get Canelita and the ammo!

488
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:01,281
Get down, get down!

489
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:08,015
Get her out, get her out!

490
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:16,296
Get the girl inside, cover her!

491
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,482
Let's get out of here!

492
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,848
Go, go, go!

493
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:45,020
Hop on!

494
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:26,231
What did the gringo tell you?

495
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:29,966
Kike Camara is in Tijuana.

496
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:31,868
What else?

497
01:05:32,508 --> 01:05:36,604
He's under the name of Orlando Gomez.

498
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:40,380
- That's it?
- Nothing else.

499
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:58,229
<i>That gringo motherfucker.</i>

500
01:06:31,868 --> 01:06:33,893
Okay, let's go.

501
01:06:35,672 --> 01:06:38,163
Get down, get down.

502
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:47,575
Get in.

503
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:24,510
We're almost there.

504
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:31,058
<i>Linito, they said it was the general</i>
<i>who screwed us over.</i>

505
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,301
Okay, Pollo.

506
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:49,311
Sniff this, Canelita.

507
01:08:17,373 --> 01:08:19,568
There's been a change
in the order of the girls.

508
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:21,334
Here she is, Laura Guerrero.

509
01:08:21,511 --> 01:08:24,639
She goes on right after Jessica.

510
01:08:24,814 --> 01:08:26,748
There's a change in the swimsuit lineup.

511
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:31,182
Listen to me, goddamn it.
Frank, get her ready.

512
01:08:31,354 --> 01:08:33,584
Right now!

513
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:31,641
Jessica, it's time.

514
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,449
Just leave it, come on.

515
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:45,659
Coming up next,
our beautiful candidates will participate...

516
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:49,025
...in the swimsuit portion
of the competition.

517
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:58,597
From Mexicali, she studies botany.

518
01:09:58,774 --> 01:10:04,303
She dreams of traveling the world
while helping to save the planet.

519
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,544
A round of applause
for Miss Jessica Verduzco.

520
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:21,586
Ambassador of this great city.
She studies pedagogy.

521
01:10:21,764 --> 01:10:28,363
Her dream is to help her brother
earn a college degree.

522
01:10:28,538 --> 01:10:33,168
A round of applause for Laura Guerrero.

523
01:10:42,218 --> 01:10:49,317
Good evening. Baja California is one of
the most beautiful states in this country.

524
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:53,485
But oftentimes, it's only known
for its defects.

525
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:59,568
I believe that with education,
tolerance and respect...

526
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:04,104
...we can show everybody
that this is a place full of light.

527
01:11:04,273 --> 01:11:07,572
Absolutely, this place is full of light.

528
01:11:07,777 --> 01:11:13,807
Let's hear it for Jessica Verduzco.
Thank you very much.

529
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:18,579
A stunning young lady.
Her presence lights up the stage...

530
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:22,315
...the Miss Baja California stage.

531
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:25,949
And now, Laura Guerrero.

532
01:11:26,128 --> 01:11:29,723
A 23-year-old from Tijuana.

533
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:36,828
And here she comes, Laura Guerrero.

534
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:43,202
How are you this evening?

535
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:44,912
Fine, thank you.

536
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:51,042
Laura, tell me, what do you
desire most, wealth or fame?

537
01:12:11,531 --> 01:12:13,829
I believe that...

538
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:20,936
I'm sorry.

539
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:26,601
Overcome by emotion. She fills the stage
with her sensitivity, Laura Guerrero.

540
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:29,873
She enhances this stage with her beauty.

541
01:12:30,049 --> 01:12:32,574
A big round of applause
for Laura Guerrero, please...

542
01:12:32,752 --> 01:12:35,050
...who leaves us filled with emotion.

543
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:38,315
And our pageant continues...

544
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,111
Arturo.

545
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:09,250
Are you okay?

546
01:13:10,156 --> 01:13:12,021
Where are you?

547
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:15,117
Okay, girls, gather together.

548
01:13:15,295 --> 01:13:18,321
- Don't go to the house, okay?
- It's prayer time, come.

549
01:13:18,798 --> 01:13:21,266
No, I'm fine.

550
01:13:21,734 --> 01:13:23,167
Yes.

551
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:25,970
The time has come.

552
01:13:26,139 --> 01:13:27,766
I'll call you later.

553
01:13:27,941 --> 01:13:30,603
- Later.
- Think about it.

554
01:13:30,777 --> 01:13:31,766
Take care.

555
01:13:31,945 --> 01:13:34,505
How many bridges
you had to cross to get here.

556
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:40,642
You have the external beauty.
Now take a look inside...

557
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:43,380
...and surprise yourself.

558
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:46,525
Seize every moment.

559
01:13:46,693 --> 01:13:50,993
As you know, this is the most
beautiful day of your life.

560
01:13:51,164 --> 01:13:52,392
What's our motto?

561
01:13:52,565 --> 01:13:56,331
Viva Miss Baja California!

562
01:13:56,836 --> 01:13:59,930
Let's go. Let's go.

563
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:14,516
<i>Coming up, we will announce</i>
<i>the winner of Miss Baja California.</i>

564
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:19,724
Miranda Cortina,
from Ensenada, Baja California.

565
01:14:19,892 --> 01:14:22,224
A big round of applause for Miranda...

566
01:14:22,395 --> 01:14:28,459
...who at this moment is receiving
a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

567
01:14:31,037 --> 01:14:38,500
Now, one of these two beauties before us
will be the new Miss Baja California.

568
01:14:38,878 --> 01:14:42,006
Please listen carefully.

569
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:49,212
I'm going to say the name of the
Miss Baja California runner-up.

570
01:14:49,389 --> 01:14:54,349
And the second-place winner is...

571
01:14:54,527 --> 01:14:57,758
...Jessica Verduzco from Mexicali,
Baja California.

572
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:00,160
A big round of applause for her.

573
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:03,131
That makes this beautiful young lady...

574
01:15:03,302 --> 01:15:09,502
...Laura Guerrero from Tijuana,
Baja California, our new beauty queen.

575
01:15:09,675 --> 01:15:15,875
And now she's going to be crowned
by the former Miss Baja California queen.

576
01:15:17,683 --> 01:15:21,119
A big round of applause for her.

577
01:15:22,188 --> 01:15:30,118
She's now receiving her
official beauty queen sash.

578
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:37,493
Those are the drums of our band La Furia,
who delight us with their music.

579
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:40,195
Our new beauty queen, Laura Guerrero...

580
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:45,367
...is being presented with the most beautiful
bouquet of flowers by this young man.

581
01:15:45,545 --> 01:15:51,609
And let's hear that round
of applause for all of our...

582
01:15:51,784 --> 01:15:55,880
...Miss Baja California contestants.

583
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:59,157
Laura Guerrero...

584
01:15:59,325 --> 01:16:04,820
...our new beauty queen,
Miss Baja California!

585
01:16:04,997 --> 01:16:09,229
Let's hear that applause.
Let's hear it for her one more time.

586
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:19,334
Laura, you meet the press
in 10 minutes. Laura?

587
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:19,094
Why did you run away?
Didn't you want to be a queen?

588
01:18:19,265 --> 01:18:21,631
Yeah, but not like that.

589
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:26,864
Well, that's the luck of the draw.
If you wanna leave, then get the hell out.

590
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:30,133
But you can't come back here again.
You can't go to your house...

591
01:18:30,309 --> 01:18:33,107
...or talk to anybody you know.

592
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:35,304
Take this money.

593
01:18:36,215 --> 01:18:40,811
Walk straight for a couple of hours
and you'll hit something.

594
01:18:41,954 --> 01:18:43,819
Go.

595
01:20:36,769 --> 01:20:38,794
Take off your clothes.

596
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:30,860
Time for your interview, man.

597
01:24:31,036 --> 01:24:32,628
Name?

598
01:24:33,472 --> 01:24:35,372
Kike Camara.

599
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:37,133
Name.

600
01:24:38,043 --> 01:24:40,068
Enrique Camara.

601
01:24:40,245 --> 01:24:42,440
Who do you work for?

602
01:24:42,748 --> 01:24:44,682
For the DEA.

603
01:24:45,451 --> 01:24:48,852
Here in Mexico,
who do you operate with?

604
01:24:53,659 --> 01:24:57,595
What do you have to say to those
motherfuckers that work with you?

605
01:25:01,433 --> 01:25:05,961
They know what they have to do.

606
01:25:09,842 --> 01:25:12,106
Why do you come here
to fuck everything up?

607
01:25:12,277 --> 01:25:15,872
You should've stayed in
your country, motherfucker.

608
01:26:42,234 --> 01:26:45,670
- Did you find something?
- Nothing.

609
01:26:45,838 --> 01:26:49,501
- Keep going.
- Just police reports, from the gringos.

610
01:26:59,284 --> 01:27:01,013
Wear this.

611
01:27:39,358 --> 01:27:41,258
Tie it off!

612
01:28:04,883 --> 01:28:08,046
Who's in to go to the hotel?

613
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,552
I don't think so, it's too dangerous.

614
01:28:10,722 --> 01:28:12,383
Come on, Lino. It's too risky.

615
01:28:12,558 --> 01:28:14,753
We'll be in and out.

616
01:28:14,927 --> 01:28:17,395
I don't know, boss.

617
01:28:18,263 --> 01:28:20,561
You monkeys.

618
01:28:23,635 --> 01:28:25,933
Where's the crown?

619
01:28:26,104 --> 01:28:27,162
Get in the truck.

620
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,607
Check the gear,
I want every gun working.

621
01:28:42,654 --> 01:28:45,316
Okay, fuckers. Who's in?

622
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:47,617
Forty grand for each one of you
for this one.

623
01:28:47,793 --> 01:28:50,489
Come on, guys, we're fearless.

624
01:28:51,096 --> 01:28:53,894
Come on. Get in.

625
01:28:55,968 --> 01:28:57,959
Get in.

626
01:29:28,133 --> 01:29:31,500
<i>It's crawling with cops,</i>
<i>we have to go around.</i>

627
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:34,400
<i>Okay, you know what to do.</i>

628
01:29:35,407 --> 01:29:37,272
<i>I'm here, partner. Talk to me.</i>

629
01:29:37,442 --> 01:29:39,740
<i>I'm sending you three cars for backup.</i>

630
01:29:39,912 --> 01:29:41,903
<i>We're on our way.</i>

631
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,138
<i>How's it looking?</i>

632
01:29:43,315 --> 01:29:45,806
We're on our way.
How's it looking, Pollo?

633
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,418
<i>He's here with his men.</i>

634
01:29:49,588 --> 01:29:51,317
How many are there?

635
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:55,586
<i>There are lots of pigs</i>
<i>and about eight trucks.</i>

636
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:56,955
Okay.

637
01:29:57,129 --> 01:30:00,929
You're going to have breakfast with the
general. They're going to introduce him...

638
01:30:01,099 --> 01:30:03,397
...to you. You're gonna flirt with him.

639
01:30:03,568 --> 01:30:06,162
Later, he'll ask you to go to his room.

640
01:30:06,338 --> 01:30:08,431
Or he'll invite you somewhere else.

641
01:30:08,607 --> 01:30:10,666
What if he doesn't invite me?

642
01:30:10,842 --> 01:30:13,777
Just flirt with him
and forget about the rest.

643
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:15,105
You know what we need.

644
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,646
We want to know
when you're alone with him.

645
01:30:17,816 --> 01:30:22,844
Take this. We'll call you when you're inside.
Don't hang up.

646
01:30:23,021 --> 01:30:25,251
Stay on the line.

647
01:30:27,326 --> 01:30:30,420
Come on, get out. Hurry, hurry.

648
01:31:04,363 --> 01:31:05,887
What's the purpose of your visit?

649
01:31:06,064 --> 01:31:09,727
My name is Laura Guerrero.
I'm here for the Miss Baja event.

650
01:31:34,259 --> 01:31:36,523
- Hello, welcome. They're waiting for you.
- Hello.

651
01:31:36,695 --> 01:31:39,926
- Where's the crown?
- Thank you.

652
01:32:14,099 --> 01:32:15,794
Where were you?

653
01:32:15,967 --> 01:32:19,130
Why did you disappear? Smile.

654
01:32:20,939 --> 01:32:22,236
Don Salomón.

655
01:32:22,407 --> 01:32:23,396
General, how are you?

656
01:32:23,575 --> 01:32:26,408
- Luisa, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
- Laura, come.

657
01:32:26,578 --> 01:32:30,537
I want you to meet Laura,
the new Miss Baja California.

658
01:32:30,715 --> 01:32:31,909
She was crowned yesterday.

659
01:32:32,084 --> 01:32:35,850
Freshly crowned, and I must say
she has a nice appearance.

660
01:32:37,089 --> 01:32:38,613
I'm at your service, general.

661
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:41,088
Take a seat, have a drink with us.

662
01:32:41,259 --> 01:32:44,820
Thank you, very kind of you,
but I have to return to my table.

663
01:32:52,471 --> 01:32:55,838
She's a hottie, general.

664
01:33:00,378 --> 01:33:04,474
- Look, you made the front page.
- You look good in the picture.

665
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:06,082
What time is the interview?

666
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:10,449
Four o'clock p.m., but we have to
arrive earlier for makeup.

667
01:33:12,824 --> 01:33:16,316
- Miss, from the general.
- Thank you.

668
01:33:16,495 --> 01:33:20,829
Beauty Queen Overnight

669
01:33:25,971 --> 01:33:28,531
I'm going to give you this phone.
Carry it at all times.

670
01:33:28,707 --> 01:33:30,675
You can't disappear
like you did yesterday.

671
01:33:30,842 --> 01:33:34,107
You caused a lot of problems
with the interviews.

672
01:33:35,313 --> 01:33:39,409
And you have to smile more often.

673
01:33:51,263 --> 01:33:55,359
What are the secretaries
from the mayor's office doing here?

674
01:34:24,896 --> 01:34:25,920
Excuse me.

675
01:34:33,605 --> 01:34:36,870
Bodies left at the
Embassy identified

676
01:35:49,914 --> 01:35:51,404
Yes.

677
01:35:55,287 --> 01:35:56,845
Yes.

678
01:36:28,887 --> 01:36:32,584
I'm Laura Guerrero.
I'm here to see General Duarte.

679
01:36:36,127 --> 01:36:39,187
I have a Laura Guerrero
here to see the general.

680
01:36:39,364 --> 01:36:40,353
<i>Let her through.</i>

681
01:36:40,532 --> 01:36:42,466
Go ahead.

682
01:36:51,042 --> 01:36:52,600
Please.

683
01:36:57,749 --> 01:37:00,946
- Look, it's that blind guy.
- What blind guy?

684
01:37:01,152 --> 01:37:03,814
The one that sings.

685
01:37:06,591 --> 01:37:09,958
Sir, Miss Laura is here.

686
01:37:10,328 --> 01:37:11,989
All right.

687
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:14,992
Come in, please.

688
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:57,406
You have to get it together.

689
01:37:57,575 --> 01:38:01,944
What's important is that you send me
some men that can stay with me.

690
01:38:02,113 --> 01:38:05,879
Make yourself a drink.
Start getting undressed.

691
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:08,848
That incident with the gringo
has caused me serious problems.

692
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:12,456
I have to issue a report very soon.

693
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:34,830
They're gonna kill you.

694
01:39:37,308 --> 01:39:40,607
They're going to kill you.
They're listening to us.

695
01:41:10,068 --> 01:41:13,265
Oh, yeah, baby, that's it.

696
01:41:13,438 --> 01:41:16,669
Open your legs.

697
01:41:19,944 --> 01:41:22,174
Stay calm.

698
01:41:25,083 --> 01:41:27,210
Go, go, go.

699
01:41:54,846 --> 01:41:58,577
Close off the area. Let's go, let's go.

700
01:42:20,938 --> 01:42:24,135
Make sure there's no one left
in the rooms.

701
01:43:18,362 --> 01:43:23,026
They're all yours. We're all set.

01:43:30,007 --> 01:43:32,999
She's under the bed, get her out.

703
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:47,252
Bring the girl over here.

704
01:43:55,032 --> 01:43:56,897
Fuck her up!

705
01:44:50,154 --> 01:44:51,644
Ready?

706
01:44:51,823 --> 01:44:55,953
- Sir, can I please make a phone call?
- Sorry, babe, we're about to start.

Keep your head up, babe.

I'm sorry.

725
01:46:56,414 --> 01:46:58,439
Forgive me.

726
01:47:05,656 --> 01:47:10,252
<i>The stunning young lady on your screen,</i>
<i>who was crowned Miss Baja California...</i>

727
01:47:10,428 --> 01:47:12,658
<i>... has just been arrested.</i>

728
01:47:12,830 --> 01:47:16,129
<i>Her name is Laura Guerrero,</i>
<i>she's from Tijuana, Baja California.</i>

729
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:21,499
<i>They found her in possession of weapons,</i>
<i>over 1000 cartons of ammo...</i>

730
01:47:21,672 --> 01:47:23,503
<i>... and approximately $100,000.</i>

731
01:47:23,674 --> 01:47:26,734
<i>The young lady is being linked</i>
<i>to the criminal group La Estrella...</i>

732
01:47:26,911 --> 01:47:30,176
<i>... who were captured during</i>

737
01:47:48,032 --> 01:47:50,523
<i>Thank you for letting me</i>
<i>voice my opinion.</i>

738
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:55,229
<i>This is definitely a very delicate subject</i>
<i>and a real shame.</i>

739
01:47:55,406 --> 01:47:59,900
<i>The actions of girls like her</i>
<i>are a real embarrassment to Mexico.</i>

740
01:48:00,077 --> 01:48:05,947
<i>The Miss Baja California pageant</i>
<i>condemns these actions.</i>

741
01:49:02,339 --> 01:49:04,136
What's going on?

742
01:49:04,508 --> 01:49:05,668
What's going on?

743
01:49:05,843 --> 01:49:07,708
Let me go!

744
01:50:17,581 --> 01:50:20,744
