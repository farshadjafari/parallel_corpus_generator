1
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:54,837
Are you going to Nablus?

2
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:03,517
It's crooked.

3
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,637
- What?
- It's crooked.

4
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:13,997
- The bumper?
- Yes, what do you think?

5
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:17,797
- But it's new.
- Maybe so, but it's crooked.

6
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:20,027
I'll take it back to check it.

7
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:23,106
That won't do any good,
it's crooked.

8
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,876
- Doesn't look it to me
- Or is it that I'm blind?

9
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:27,556
You could be wrong.

10
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:30,037
- Appearances are deceiving.
- Look, kid

11
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:32,917
I see very well,
thank Allah.

12
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:35,917
- It's not crooked.
- It is, it's crooked.

13
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:38,387
- There's nothing more to see.
- No, there is.

14
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,917
Abu Salim should come to see it.

15
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,197
- What?
- That.

16
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:45,157
- It will be because you see bad.
- What did you say?

17
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,397
It's straight.

18
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:50,547
Let Abu Salim see,
he'll tell you.

19
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,077
Check with a level.

20
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:00,797
Who sees bad?

21
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,987
You see bad.

22
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:08,757
Look, it's not the bumper,
it's the ground.

23
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:12,037
Don't trick me,
I have eyes.

24
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:15,946
The ground is sloped,
the bumper is fine.

25
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:18,836
Where is Abu Salim?
I want to talk to him.

26
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:22,596
Abu Salim isn't here,
we can resolve this.

27
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:25,146
Didn't you hear me?
Call Abu Salim.

28
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,916
It's crooked
like your father.

29
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:31,356
- Which side is crooked?
- The right.

30
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,637
Well, you're right - it is crooked.

31
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,637
You risk losing me work.

32
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:52,787
- Why didn't you say anything?
- It wasn't Said, it was me.

33
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:55,557
You'll end up in jail
and nobody will go to see you.

34
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,667
- Hi.
- Hi Suha, how's it going?

35
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:02,067
You know,
Life has many twists and turns.

36
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:04,117
- Do you have my car?
- Sure.

37
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,947
He's already a grandfather.

38
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:09,597
Said, take a look.

39
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:13,996
Come here, Khaled.

40
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:16,076
Still not finished.

41
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:21,596
Why do have this old car?
Buy yourself a new one.

42
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:24,876
I like old cars,
They kind of go with me.

43
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,596
You'd like an Alfa Romeo
much better.

44
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:29,476
An Alfa, do you think?

45
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,786
There aren't any many
in the West Bank.

46
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:35,426
Because the spare parts are expensive
and hard to find.

47
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:39,796
The truth is,
cars don't interest me much.

48
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:42,116
But I like the name.

49
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,596
Alfa Romeo.

50
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:52,397
You can pick it up tomorrow,
the Othman checkpoint is closed.

51
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:54,987
- Do you mind?
- Doesn't matter to me.

52
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:56,827
Don't make fun of my accent.

53
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,117
I was born in France,
and grew up in Morocco.

54
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:02,077
- And now I have returned.
- Welcome.

55
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,677
Thanks,
I'll see you tomorrow?

56
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:07,076
If Allah wills it.

57
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:27,226
- It worked.
- There is wind...

58
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:33,756
What are you doing tomorrow?

59
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:36,236
Looking for work, I have to.

60
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,316
Where did you get that cassette? Belt?
I'm not familiar with it.

61
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:10,546
I found it.

62
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:12,866
In Suha's car.

63
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,426
Did you find it or steal it?

64
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,316
I'm going to return it.

65
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,596
I think you like her.

66
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:37,676
Forget it.

67
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:40,756
You're lucky,
she's the daughter of Abu Assam.

68
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:42,796
OK, OK, I'll shut up.

69
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:55,275
Just in time.

70
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:31,666
It's cold.

71
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,435
Can you close the window?
There's too much wind.

72
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:59,225
The electric windows
are broken. I'm sorry.

73
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,465
I can't.

74
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,075
It costs a thousand shekels to repair it.
It's too expensive.

75
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,265
Some day everything is going to be better.

76
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,276
You're not from here.

77
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,066
Are you married?

78
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,706
What did you ask?
- If you are married.

79
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:06,425
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

80
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:27,346
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, what's up?

81
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:31,356
- Same as always out there.
- There's a lot that you don't get to see.

82
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:33,826
- I haven't moved from here.
- In Sweden,

83
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:36,436
the cars respect
the traffic lights.

84
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:39,345
The pedestrians look
where they're crossing.

85
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:42,555
But they have a higher percentage
of suicides.

86
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,075
What?

87
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,675
What do you find so interesting with
that awful place?

88
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:48,715
They're crazy.

89
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,105
And I've never seen
a queen so ugly.

90
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:54,665
But she has a nice face.

91
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:57,115
She tells us how to deal
with informers.

92
00:09:57,835 --> 00:10:00,745
We care less about her
than the collaborators.

93
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,425
It would be better to kill
them all.

94
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:06,475
Drag them into the street
and shoot them.

95
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,545
- Who?
- The collaborators.

96
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:09,595
Of course.

97
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:13,475
Their families, their neighbors
and anyone who gives them money.

98
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:15,225
You would kill them all?

99
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:18,435
Why the friends and their family too?

100
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,755
What happened to you, are you Swedish?

101
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,545
A little further back.

102
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:42,385
A little more.

103
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:46,515
That's it,
three centimeters to the left.

104
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,465
That's it, perfect.

105
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,665
Lift your head a little.

106
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,065
Less.

107
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,235
Back more.

108
00:10:58,355 --> 00:10:59,945
Another step back.

109
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,115
That's it, don't move.

110
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:05,955
Come on, a smile.

111
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:07,625
Come on, smile.

112
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,945
If you don't smile
I can't take the photo.

113
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:13,355
I don't want to.

114
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:15,115
I can't make you.

115
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,275
You're in a hurry?

116
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,355
OK, I'll have them tomorrow.

117
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:24,955
- Good night.
- Good night.

118
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,075
How are you?

119
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,465
Good, you?

120
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:44,075
Can't complain.
How's it going in the garage?

121
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,515
- Same as always.
- They fired Khaled?

122
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:50,395
- Yes, but it wasn't his fault.
- This time.

123
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:53,355
It surprised me
that it took so long.

124
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,225
Do you remember
the martyr Abu Assam?

125
00:11:58,155 --> 00:11:59,955
Although it cost him
his safety,

126
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:02,555
he said that to fear death
is to be dead.

127
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,985
And he had no don't doubt that

128
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:07,065
death would come soon enough,
without pain.

129
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,225
He drove the Mossad nuts.

130
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,915
They spent millions
to capture him.

131
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:16,345
When they surrounded him,
he knew that he was finished.

132
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:20,395
He opened the door and shouted:
"You've come too late."

133
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:32,784
Listen, Said.

134
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:36,114
We've decided to take revenge.

135
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:39,315
On the killers of Abu Hazem
and the son of Um Jaber

136
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:41,955
who died
in the air raid.

137
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:44,835
It will be tomorrow in Tel Aviv.

138
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,275
Khaled and you have been chosen.

139
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:51,355
You will go together, like you wanted.

140
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:54,225
Tomorrow?

141
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,905
Yes, are you ready?

142
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,035
Yes, of course. It's the will of Allah.

143
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,265
You'll spend the night
with your family.

144
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:12,945
You already know
that you cannot reveal it to anyone.

145
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:13,945
Sure.

146
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:16,905
I will be with you
until you go.

147
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:23,794
- Are you happy?
- I am. I give thanks to Allah.

148
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:29,544
Mama.

149
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:33,394
You're very late.
You're preoccupied.

150
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:36,514
"You're very late.
You're preoccupied."

151
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,794
If I'm so late,

152
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,434
then tie me up with the dog.

153
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:44,234
- I'm sure that we don't have one.
- Quiet, quiet.

154
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,784
- How are you, Jamal?
- Very well.

155
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:49,995
And school?
Less trouble than taking care of the kids?

156
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:52,225
I'm trying,
education is important.

157
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:53,595
Please.

158
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,035
Thanks, Said.

159
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,025
Take off that shirt.

160
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,955
It's my favorite
and you wore it to work.

161
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:05,515
I didn't know it.

162
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:07,745
Jamal is going to sleep here, mama.

163
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,035
- The street is cut off.
- You're always welcome.

164
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,154
- Take it off.
- Enough.

165
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:54,594
I got a permit for Israel.

166
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,955
Tomorrow I am going to work
in Tel Aviv.

167
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,865
- When did you get it?
- Today.

168
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,675
Congratulations,
it's fantastic, my son.

169
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:09,544
- Have you spoken with Abu Salim?
- Not yet.

170
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:13,184
You should - you were lucky
that he hired you.

171
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:16,234
He has plenty guys
to work cheap.

172
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:19,784
Don't sing a victory song yet,
you should find work.

173
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:22,944
But tell me,

174
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:27,874
how do you get through,
young people, now that you can go?

175
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:31,634
They're starting to let people pass.
Jamal is in charge of everything.

176
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:34,274
Allah bless Jamal.

177
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:36,944
Take this.

178
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,114
But what is this?

179
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:48,544
What's happening?
What's going on?

180
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:53,714
- But, what is this?
- What is happening?

181
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:56,634
Stop being a fool
you're driving me up the wall.

182
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:03,154
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, thanks.

183
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:06,834
Can I stay to sleep?
They have cut off the road.

184
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:08,744
You are always welcome.

185
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,744
I already told you
that you could stay.

186
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,024
Pass me the salt.

187
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:26,674
Salt, Jamal?

188
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:47,834
You're so good,
you know how to cook.

189
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:49,904
Thanks.

190
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,114
Have you changed the filter, mama?

191
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,754
The water was better before.

192
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:57,103
Shut off that radio
that you brought in.

193
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:23,024
Said.

194
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,424
What happened, did something happen?

195
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,584
- I brought you the keys.
- What?

196
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:32,754
You brought me the keys?

197
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,664
At four in the morning?

198
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,114
Yeah, I know...

199
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,354
I took them without asking.

200
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:43,874
Well...

201
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:48,343
- Maybe this is a bad time and...
- Come in.

202
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:50,703
- What?
- Come in, now that you are here.

203
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,073
I can't.

204
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:53,983
I've got to go.

205
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:00,353
Tea?

206
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,513
- How much sugar?
- Four teaspoons.

207
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:08,273
You are one of those who takes their
sugar with tea.

208
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,263
OK, I resign myself to three.

209
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:13,953
There is something that I don't understand.

210
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:17,113
Why do they use so much sugar in Nablus?

211
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:21,033
It's the custom,
Everyone does it.

212
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,263
OK.

213
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,504
Listen, what do you do
when you're not delivering keys at dawn?

214
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,064
What do you do to have fun?

215
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:33,514
I don't know, nothing.

216
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,704
- What are you saying?
- Do you go to the cafes?

217
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,913
At times, to smoke the nargila.

218
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:43,073
And besides that,
do you do sports, do you read?

219
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,383
Do you go to the movies?

220
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,073
No, in Nablus there are no movies.

221
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:49,503
Yeah, I know.

222
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:52,063
But at some point you went to the movies?

223
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,463
Yes, it's been ten years.

224
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,583
We burned the "Rivoli" cinema.

225
00:19:58,193 --> 00:19:59,423
You burned the cinema?

226
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,113
There were a lot of us.

227
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,553
Sure, but why would you have
done that to the cinema?

228
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:06,913
Not to the cinema, to Israel.

229
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:10,433
They would close the way
to the workers of the West Bank.

230
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:13,423
And we went out into the street
to protest.

231
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:17,393
We finished in the cinema
and we set it on fire.

232
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,633
Why the cinema?

233
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:21,793
Why us?

234
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:25,023
I don't know.

235
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:28,313
We kept the video.

236
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:30,833
- Oh, so you do see films.
- At times.

237
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,513
Well, tell me,
which is your favorite "genre"?

238
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,713
Which is my favorite "genre"?

239
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:38,753
Don't make fun of my "genre".

240
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:41,713
Oh... what type.

241
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:45,233
There are action films,
science fiction, documentaries...

242
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,753
- What makes you cry?
- And what bores you?

243
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,033
What bores me?

244
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:52,983
- Like?
- Like life.

245
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,223
I don't believe you.

246
00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:59,423
I'm sure that your life
is not boring.

247
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,623
Look,

248
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,753
I believe that your life is like

249
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:08,193
a minimalist Japanese film.

250
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:10,953
May Allah bless you.

251
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:18,073
Is it true that you're
Abu Assam's daughter?

252
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,833
They said that he was a hero.

253
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:22,463
You should be very proud of him.

254
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,273
I would prefer to have him alive
to being proud of him.

255
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:30,712
Our cause continues to live
today thanks to him.

256
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:33,742
There are many ways
of staying alive.

257
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:35,432
It doesn't depend on us.

258
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:37,952
The occupation shapes
the resistance.

259
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,392
Resistance can take
many forms.

260
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:45,713
But we should recognize
that we are lacking military force.

261
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:48,183
There are those who look for other
alternatives.

262
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:51,193
To accept the defeat
of our grandfathers?

263
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,673
The injustice?

264
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:57,743
This conversation
is going nowhere.

265
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:14,423
Are you coming back?

266
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,713
Hopefully.

267
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:21,753
Good.

268
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:24,342
Goodbye, night visitor.

269
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:37,502
Khaled.

270
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:44,982
Here.

271
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,152
Listen, Khaled,
why does your father limp?

272
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:51,112
During the first intifada,
they came into the house.

273
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,752
The Israelis let him choose
which leg he wanted to keep.

274
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:59,793
I would have let them break both of mine
before I would let them humiliate me.

275
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:18,592
It's incredible
how you much you look like your father.

276
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,022
Come, sit a while
and drink the coffee.

277
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:47,392
Tell me about it.

278
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:49,542
How was it?

279
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,272
What's gotten into you this morning?

280
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:54,902
Was it like the people said?

281
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:57,222
Forget it.

282
00:24:58,192 --> 00:24:59,312
It's the past.

283
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,232
Allah took pity on him.

284
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:04,872
Said.

285
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:07,183
What your father did,

286
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:10,152
he did it for us.

287
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:14,022
Yes, but...

288
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:18,192
The world is changing.

289
00:25:19,632 --> 00:25:21,592
Everything changes except Allah.

290
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:24,502
Now that's the truth.

291
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,272
Ah...

292
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,392
You don't have a future.

293
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:44,832
What a fool...
you frightened me.

294
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,472
When will you grow up?

295
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:47,782
Good day.

296
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:51,232
Good day, Jamal.

297
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:53,142
There is coffee.

298
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:55,512
No thanks, we have to go.

299
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,192
What can we do
if there is no justice or liberty?

300
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:05,191
There is no remedy except
to fight.

301
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:08,421
If we accept
that the strong would eat the weak,

302
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:11,661
we are no better
than animals.

303
00:26:12,511 --> 00:26:13,741
It's unacceptable.

304
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:16,982
It's better to die
than to be the inferior ones.

305
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,742
He who fights for liberty

306
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:23,352
gives his life for it.

307
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,942
You will change all of this.

308
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:45,942
- Hi.
- Hi.

309
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:54,072
Hi, Jamal.

310
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:03,341
It's our turn.

311
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:25,222
In the name of Allah,
the merciful one.

312
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:27,592
In the holy book, Allah says:

313
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:31,262
"If they harm you,
they harm my people".

314
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:32,992
In times like these,

315
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,462
Allah recognizes the believers
and chooses the martyrs.

316
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:38,592
Allah does not love the unjust.

317
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:40,632
Allah speaks the truth.

318
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:45,192
In response to the occupation,
the injustice and the crimes,

319
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:47,862
and in order to support the resistance,

320
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:50,392
I have decided to sacrifice myself.

321
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:53,871
The only thing we can do is to fight.

322
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,871
For Israel, to live
with the Palestinians as equals

323
00:27:58,031 --> 00:27:59,861
inside a democratic system

324
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:01,901
is equivalent to a suicide.

325
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:06,231
Neither does it accept the solution
of two states,

326
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:09,671
even though it is an attitude
to the detriment of the Palestinians.

327
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:14,221
We are only left with accepting
the occupation or disappearing.

328
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:18,591
We have forced an end
to the occupation

329
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:21,351
with political means
and peaceful means

330
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:25,511
But Israel puts up
more settlements

331
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:29,511
and throw us out of Jerusalem
and to engage in 'ethnic cleansing'.

332
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:33,992
It uses its war machine
and its political and economic power

333
00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:36,992
to force us to accept
its conditions

334
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:41,672
to convert us
to being inferior or to die.

335
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:45,502
But, as a martyr,
I do not fear death.

336
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:47,911
Only this way would I come out victorious.

337
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:51,221
And conquer the threats
of their political and military power.

338
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:53,351
I want to die as a martyr.

339
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,381
Dear parents,

340
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,701
I ask your forgiveness
for leaving this way,

341
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,231
but soon we will be together again.

342
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:13,741
Goodbye to you.

343
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:18,221
There is only one God,
and Mohammed is his prophet.

344
00:29:19,151 --> 00:29:20,711
Allah speaks the truth.

345
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:32,581
How is it?

346
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:39,462
You haven't recorded,
something isn't working correctly.

347
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,581
Something happened,
we'll try it again.

348
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,861
In the name of Allah,
the merciful one.

349
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,541
- In the holy book...
- Stop, stop.

350
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,511
It's not working.

351
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:07,111
- Fix it, you idiot!
- Calm down, Khaled.

352
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,511
Now you can make it better,
you have another chance.

353
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:22,061
Ready.

354
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,111
In the name of Allah,
the merciful one.

355
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,870
Allah said: "If they harm you,
they harm my people".

356
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,820
In times like these...

357
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:56,141
Ma,

358
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,231
before I forget,

359
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,141
there are water filters
in Al Mokhtar.

360
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:05,071
They are cheaper
than the ones from Kanaze.

361
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:08,111
Better buy them there.

362
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,031
Is that for the video?

363
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:15,351
No, but I forgot
to tell it to my mother.

364
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:16,261
Fine.

365
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:20,391
In the name of Allah,
the merciful one.

366
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,511
We will continue the fight

367
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:28,141
until the end.

368
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,460
We only dispose

369
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,310
of our bodies

370
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,110
against the occupation.

371
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,980
Can you hold it?

372
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,510
Pretty good.

373
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,710
Abu Karem.

374
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,980
- Good day.
- Good day.

375
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,830
- Which one is Said and which is Khaled?
- I'm Khaled.

376
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,710
I'm Said.

377
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,750
It's a great honor to meet you
before you leave.

378
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,270
Praise Allah, you have great character.

379
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,980
- Have you eaten well?
- Yes, very well, thank Allah.

380
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,070
- It has been explained to them?
- They're all set.

381
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:18,910
It is a great honor
that very few achieve.

382
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,700
Allah willing, when you have ascended to heaven,

383
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,190
we will take care of everything
here below.

384
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,390
We will honor your heroism.

385
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,710
Some request?

386
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,950
I hope

387
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,270
that my family
will not suffer reprisals.

388
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,270
I want our photo
to be put up in the plaza.

389
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,780
We are proud of you.

390
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,150
We are united,
we will protect your families.

391
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,740
Let's go.

392
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,350
It is the first important
operation in two years.

393
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,470
It has been carefully planned,
we will surprise everyone.

394
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,069
You were not chosen at random.

395
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,139
We knew that you would be capable
of doing it.

396
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,659
We will always be with you.

397
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,910
We are proud.

398
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,780
So, the legend in person.

399
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,030
These belts are new,
they have a closure mechanism.

400
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,940
When they are activated,
no one can open them.

401
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,430
Only us.

402
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,710
Trying to open them is enough
to make them explode.

403
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:02,389
If the soldiers find out,
you will be shot.

404
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:04,939
You must be quicker than they are

405
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,229
and detonate them by pulling
on this cord.

406
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:13,029
If the moment arrives,
you will kill many soldiers.

407
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:17,139
If you are noticed,
they will not risk themselves.

408
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:19,979
If they have the least suspicion,

409
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:23,869
they will shoot you,
from a safe distance.

410
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:27,949
You should pull
the cord before.

411
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,349
Do you understand?

412
00:37:56,389 --> 00:37:57,829
On the other side of the barricade

413
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,189
there will be a man named
Abu Shabaab.

414
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:01,869
He will take you to the place.

415
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,699
One of the two will go first.

416
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:07,509
The other will follow
15 minutes later.

417
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,629
It's more effective.

418
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:13,339
Then there will be
many soldiers and police.

419
00:38:13,509 --> 00:38:15,579
The second bomb
will do more damage.

420
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,549
Very well planned.

421
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:22,299
Here is money
and false identification.

422
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,739
Memorize the information.

423
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:29,749
If someone questions you about something,
let Abu Shabaab give the answers.

424
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:33,429
In Tel Aviv, you are from Jerusalem
and you are going to a wedding.

425
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,659
- Whose wedding?
- It doesn't matter.

426
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:39,549
Above all,
do not be afraid of the soldiers.

427
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:42,860
Look them in the eyes,
without blinking.

428
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,230
Remember that you control them.

429
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,069
Their lives are
in your hands.

430
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:48,909
Stay calm.

431
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,389
If a soldier grabs you,
he's a dead man.

432
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:56,179
He is betting everything

433
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:57,909
because he fears death.

434
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,669
If you don't fear death,
you control life.

435
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:07,189
If he insists on searching you
it will be the gates of heaven.

436
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:09,259
We will see who searches who.

437
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:11,109
Leave it in the hands of Allah.

438
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:14,029
Another thing.

439
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,029
When the first one does it,
it is better that the other one not look.

440
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:26,259
And then?

441
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,429
You will go home two angels.

442
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:34,429
Are you sure?

443
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:35,949
Of course.

444
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:38,419
Now you will see for yourself.

445
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:10,069
Wait here.

446
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,189
I will check to be sure
that everything is in order.

447
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:06,819
Khaled.

448
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:08,739
What?

449
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:14,109
- We're not making a mistake are we?
- But, what are you saying?

450
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:19,349
Absolutely not.

451
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:21,509
In an hour we will be heroes.

452
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:25,109
We will be with Allah
in paradise.

453
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:39,858
We've already said it.

454
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:42,068
You told me
that we don't have a choice.

455
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,898
Under the occupation,
we are already dead.

456
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:46,868
I know, I know.

457
00:41:48,348 --> 00:41:50,148
But, isn't there any other way?

458
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:53,628
- Are you afraid?
- No, I'm not afraid.

459
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,908
I don't know.

460
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:58,698
Soon you will know.

461
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:01,308
In as much as we can...

462
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:06,229
Is it true that before you die

463
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,989
you see your entire life passing
as if it were a video?

464
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,829
Do you believe that is true?

465
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:49,418
I'm with you.

466
00:42:58,148 --> 00:42:59,948
Let's go.

467
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,298
Look what you've done to yourself.

468
00:43:05,268 --> 00:43:07,148
Good, Abu Shabaab is there.

469
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:10,458
He's Israeli, but cooperative,
we pay him well.

470
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:14,069
He doesn't speak Arabic,
do you speak much English?

471
00:43:14,229 --> 00:43:16,539
- I can get by.
- Good.

472
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,589
Very good.

473
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:21,029
Read the Koran and pray.

474
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:23,748
Well,

475
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:26,668
who will be the first?

476
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:30,308
- Me.
- Me.

477
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:37,268
- Heads or tails?
- Tails.

478
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:39,948
Tails.

479
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:48,468
Good luck guys.

480
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:19,467
What happened?

481
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:20,747
- And Said?
- I don't know.

482
00:46:05,627 --> 00:46:07,507
- Where's Said?
- He's disappeared.

483
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:09,937
We've got to look for him.

484
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:13,227
The helicopters will come,
we can't wait.

485
00:46:14,587 --> 00:46:18,137
Take out a description with a photo,
in order to find him.

486
00:46:20,787 --> 00:46:22,937
Remove the explosives,
what are you waiting for?

487
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,217
Rip it off,
it will hurt less.

488
00:46:35,547 --> 00:46:39,098
- You couldn't use another thing?
- It's the best system.

489
00:46:39,388 --> 00:46:41,378
We weren't thinking
that we would have to take it off.

490
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:49,778
And now?

491
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:54,348
We wait.

492
00:49:04,267 --> 00:49:07,387
Brothers,
it will be better that we go.

493
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,667
It could be that they've caught Said

494
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,267
or that he was a traitor.

495
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:14,577
We should tell all the members

496
00:49:14,747 --> 00:49:16,817
that they have been in contact with him.

497
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,627
I know Said,
he has not betrayed us.

498
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:21,587
It's only a precaution.

499
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:22,777
Jamal.

500
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:27,227
We planned this operation
for many months.

501
00:49:28,147 --> 00:49:30,137
You said that you would be
responsible for them.

502
00:49:30,827 --> 00:49:32,497
I've known them forever.

503
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:35,307
It's put a lot of fighters
in danger.

504
00:49:35,587 --> 00:49:37,947
Scatter them all except
for a few.

505
00:49:38,827 --> 00:49:41,137
Logically,
Abu Shabaab is the traitor.

506
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:42,867
I really doubt it.

507
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,536
He didn't show up until after
the operation.

508
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,307
To the roof tile factory.

509
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:21,457
Close the door again.

510
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:24,267
Pull it shut, quickly,
with a slam.

511
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:42,906
? For a wedding?

512
00:50:45,226 --> 00:50:48,696
Dressed like that, I'm sure that
you're not going to deliver roof tiles.

513
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:51,746
I'm going to a wedding...

514
00:50:51,946 --> 00:50:53,016
At the factory?

515
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:06,106
Contaminated water?

516
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,866
There's nothing
like the Kanaze filters.

517
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:11,827
Kanaze filters,
the most pure water.

518
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:13,267
Filters!

519
00:51:14,827 --> 00:51:16,737
Not all the filters in the world

520
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,057
will clean the water contaminated
by the settlers.

521
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,257
Have you heard about the water?

522
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,897
Yes, it's not important...

523
00:51:29,067 --> 00:51:30,107
No, I don't know it.

524
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:31,067
No?

525
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:36,176
Apparently, it contains a product
that attacks the quality of the sperm.

526
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:40,456
Even though they use it for rat poison,
it doesn't affect me.

527
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:43,426
I already have five sons, five.

528
00:51:59,306 --> 00:52:02,986
The operation is postponed,
now they will be looking for us.

529
00:52:03,146 --> 00:52:06,296
Said has not betrayed us,
something happened, I know it.

530
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:08,616
It was too well planned.

531
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:10,626
Something is going wrong.

532
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:13,826
We won't have to wait long to know
what is happening.

533
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:16,026
But it is better to be prudent.

534
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:19,697
Said is carrying a bomb on his back,
How is he going to meet us?

535
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:24,227
If he's talked, a missile can drop
in an instant and kill us.

536
00:52:24,907 --> 00:52:26,577
Well let me go alone.

537
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:30,176
We are waiting to find out
what happened.

538
00:52:31,506 --> 00:52:33,576
He has not betrayed us,
I know that.

539
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:36,776
Let me go look for him,
I know how he reacts.

540
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:38,576
I will find him.

541
00:52:39,786 --> 00:52:42,696
I've got to find him,
the operation must continue.

542
00:52:45,386 --> 00:52:46,296
Here.

543
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:49,426
If we had had them before...

544
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,026
They are too easy to trace.

545
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:54,866
Abu Shabaab was going to give
you one in Tel Aviv.

546
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:59,226
Find Said
before the day is over.

547
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:01,746
Or we will have to settle things ourselves.

548
00:55:27,305 --> 00:55:28,105
Said.

549
00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:30,615
Are you going to get married?

550
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:33,025
No, I...

551
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:35,745
Is Khaled here?

552
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:20,385
- Where is Said?
- I don't know.

553
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,695
- You've come back to get him in trouble.
- Lord, no...

554
00:56:43,145 --> 00:56:45,105
- But, come in.
- No, I'm in a hurry.

555
00:56:46,745 --> 00:56:47,945
And this suit?

556
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,106
I have to go.

557
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:53,866
Please, if he comes,
give him this telephone number.

558
00:56:54,146 --> 00:56:55,626
It's important. Goodbye.

559
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:30,215
Is someone there?

560
00:57:47,905 --> 00:57:51,055
- Excuse me, have you seen Khaled?
- He already left.

561
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:53,425
- Did he say anything?
- No, nothing special.

562
00:57:55,345 --> 00:57:57,385
- Can I go to wash up?
- Sure.

563
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,615
- Isn't that Said?
- Yes.

564
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,025
Why does he look
like a settler?

565
00:59:04,504 --> 00:59:06,145
You can't change destiny.

566
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:09,145
There is no other way out.

567
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:14,825
You are a volunteer for Allah.

568
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:45,055
Come on, it's already late.

569
00:59:45,225 --> 00:59:47,134
What is going on,
you've gone with your friend?

570
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:51,094
- Tomorrow I will not come.
- And that suit, something happening?

571
00:59:51,264 --> 00:59:54,254
- Tomorrow I won't come.
- OK, but make coffee.

572
00:59:57,384 --> 01:00:00,744
- Has Khaled come?
- Luckily, I've freed myself of him.

573
01:00:04,064 --> 01:00:05,944
- Everything is OK?
- Very well.

574
01:00:06,104 --> 01:00:08,464
If you have problems,
you can count on me.

575
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:12,614
What is that?

576
01:00:16,305 --> 01:00:17,945
- Hi.
- Hi.

577
01:00:18,105 --> 01:00:20,625
- It's not working well.
- That didn't last long.

578
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:24,105
It started to make
this horrible noise, can you hear it?

579
01:00:24,265 --> 01:00:26,625
I will tell Said
to take a quick look.

580
01:00:27,185 --> 01:00:27,905
Said!

581
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:30,905
Said!

582
01:00:36,145 --> 01:00:39,665
- Better for you to stay inside.
- I'm OK here.

583
01:00:40,824 --> 01:00:42,544
I can't work wearing that.

584
01:00:53,144 --> 01:00:55,184
- Idiot!
- Go to hell!

585
01:01:06,504 --> 01:01:07,334
That's it.

586
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,974
You can go, it's fixed.

587
01:01:13,144 --> 01:01:15,054
- What do you want?
- Something happened to you.

588
01:01:15,224 --> 01:01:17,824
- Yesterday you weren't like this.
- Nothing is happening to me.

589
01:01:18,704 --> 01:01:20,504
Why are you so weird?

590
01:01:20,704 --> 01:01:22,905
Nothing is happening to me, it's the truth.

591
01:01:24,225 --> 01:01:24,945
Said!

592
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:28,785
Said, the watch,
I'm so sorry.

593
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:29,945
Said.

594
01:01:30,345 --> 01:01:31,335
It doesn't matter.

595
01:01:32,425 --> 01:01:33,745
No, it's a problem.

596
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,704
What do you want to do?

597
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,184
- I'll bring it in for repair.
- No, leave it.

598
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:48,414
Abu Salim!

599
01:01:49,944 --> 01:01:51,614
- Have you seen Said?
- It's you.

600
01:01:51,784 --> 01:01:55,494
I thought I was free of you.
And the car, the suit?

601
01:01:55,664 --> 01:01:58,704
- Doesn't matter. Have you seen him?
- He's gone with a customer.

602
01:01:58,864 --> 01:02:00,744
- What?
- With his favorite customer.

603
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:02,544
Suha, daughter of Abu Assam.

604
01:02:06,944 --> 01:02:09,064
They'll fix it right away it.

605
01:02:11,264 --> 01:02:12,704
I'll feel better.

606
01:02:20,784 --> 01:02:22,144
- Are you?
- Suha...

607
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:23,904
Go ahead.

608
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:27,854
No, better you.
It wasn't anything important.

609
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:33,384
Stop, the store is there.

610
01:02:37,784 --> 01:02:39,264
You seem annoyed.

611
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,864
- Annoyed?
- Yes.

612
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:43,464
No, you've seen me
when I'm annoyed.

613
01:02:44,224 --> 01:02:45,584
12.50 shekels.

614
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:49,744
Excuse me, what is this tape?

615
01:02:49,944 --> 01:02:51,744
- The farewell of a martyr?
- Yes.

616
01:02:52,304 --> 01:02:54,864
Also it's about the collaborators.

617
01:02:55,824 --> 01:02:56,544
What?

618
01:02:57,384 --> 01:03:00,224
Their confessions
before they shot them.

619
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:01,624
Let's go.

620
01:03:01,784 --> 01:03:05,224
- But, do you sell or rent them?
- Both.

621
01:03:06,224 --> 01:03:07,264
How much?

622
01:03:07,464 --> 01:03:10,824
Well, if you buy them,
they're 15 shekels each.

623
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:14,374
But if you rent them,
it's only 3 shekels.

624
01:03:14,544 --> 01:03:16,064
Thanks, we're going?

625
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:18,664
The cost is the same
if it's a martyr or a collaborator?

626
01:03:19,184 --> 01:03:22,974
The truth is, I could ask for more
for the collaborator videos.

627
01:03:23,144 --> 01:03:24,214
There's a greater demand.

628
01:03:24,423 --> 01:03:27,733
But I would have to reprogram
the cash register.

629
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:28,733
Well, bye.

630
01:03:29,623 --> 01:03:31,263
You forgot your watch.

631
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:20,463
Does it seem normal to you
that they sell these tapes?

632
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,693
- Is there anything normal here?
- It makes me sick.

633
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:26,503
Three million fight
for survival.

634
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:27,983
Nablus is a jail.

635
01:04:28,183 --> 01:04:31,463
I don't know what I'm doing here,
all of this is shit!

636
01:04:31,623 --> 01:04:33,263
My father was a collaborator.

637
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:35,303
They executed him.

638
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:50,014
I was ten years old then.

639
01:04:56,464 --> 01:04:59,694
- I'm so sorry.
- No, don't let it bother you.

640
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:03,664
How are you taking it?

641
01:05:04,224 --> 01:05:04,944
Well...

642
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:08,784
It's not as bad as it seems.

643
01:05:14,023 --> 01:05:15,583
You want to talk

644
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:16,933
about it?

645
01:05:17,143 --> 01:05:18,293
For what?

646
01:05:18,943 --> 01:05:20,773
Would it stop the occupation?

647
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:24,533
Will I forget that my father
was a collaborator?

648
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,943
Everyone knows it.

649
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:32,173
- I didn't know it.
- Naturally.

650
01:05:32,783 --> 01:05:35,583
You live in another world,
daughter of Abu Assam,

651
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,333
in a good neighborhood.

652
01:05:42,623 --> 01:05:43,693
Why are you saying that?

653
01:05:43,903 --> 01:05:46,023
To speak for the ones that you pity?

654
01:05:46,423 --> 01:05:49,573
In order to entertain
the living a little more?

655
01:06:27,543 --> 01:06:29,823
- Have you seen Said?
- Another suit?

656
01:06:30,423 --> 01:06:32,573
- No, no, no!
- Where is Said?

657
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:33,943
Where? Tell me!

658
01:06:34,543 --> 01:06:35,943
He was heading East.

659
01:06:38,063 --> 01:06:39,813
- His father's grave.
- Wait!

660
01:06:44,383 --> 01:06:46,343
Why are you doing this?
Tell me!

661
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:49,973
In life there are no equals,
we're only equals in death.

662
01:06:50,183 --> 01:06:53,023
You were capable of killing
and of dying for equality,

663
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:56,463
you can find a way
to be equal in life.

664
01:06:57,143 --> 01:07:00,773
- Yeah, with your human rights?
- Why not?

665
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:04,903
At least the Israelis
wouldn't have excuses for killing us.

666
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:09,783
Don't be naive,
there won't be freedom without a fight.

667
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:12,973
While, there is injustice,
someone must sacrifice themselves.

668
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:15,453
It's not a sacrifice,
it's revenge.

669
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,613
If you kill, there's no difference

670
01:07:19,223 --> 01:07:21,863
between the victims
and the oppressors.

671
01:07:22,023 --> 01:07:24,173
If we had an air force,

672
01:07:24,343 --> 01:07:27,413
we wouldn't need martyrs
there's the difference.

673
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:29,453
The difference is that, as it is,

674
01:07:29,623 --> 01:07:32,903
the Israeli's continue being
more powerful militarily.

675
01:07:33,143 --> 01:07:34,893
In death we are equals.

676
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:38,373
- Paradise awaits us.
- Paradise doesn't exist!

677
01:07:38,543 --> 01:07:41,933
- It exists in your head!
- Allah doesn't want you!

678
01:07:42,823 --> 01:07:44,103
May Allah forgive you.

679
01:07:44,823 --> 01:07:46,733
If you weren't the daughter
of Abu Assam...

680
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:52,583
I prefer to believe in paradise
than living in hell.

681
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:54,783
With this life,
we are already dead.

682
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,062
I choose death

683
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,252
if the alternative
is so much more bitter.

684
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:05,222
And what happens to us?

685
01:08:05,702 --> 01:08:08,822
To those that remain?
Do you believe that we come out winning?

686
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:13,503
Don't you see that this type
of action destroys us?

687
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:15,373
You give Israel

688
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:18,223
the perfect excuse for continuing.

689
01:08:18,383 --> 01:08:21,503
- You think that without a reason they would stop?
- Yes.

690
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:23,623
We've got to change the war.

691
01:08:23,823 --> 01:08:26,783
- To make a moral war.
- Even though Israel is immoral?

692
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:28,653
- Israel never!
- Look out!

693
01:08:28,863 --> 01:08:30,453
Flying martyrs!

694
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:44,143
Sons of bitches.

695
01:09:44,423 --> 01:09:45,093
Said!

696
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:47,862
Said.

697
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:48,972
Said.

698
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:51,542
Praise Allah.

699
01:09:51,782 --> 01:09:53,102
Praise Allah.

700
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:55,652
Easy, easy, stay calm.

701
01:09:56,782 --> 01:09:57,582
Stay calm.

702
01:09:58,502 --> 01:10:00,142
I've been stupid.

703
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:02,492
We've got to find Jamal,
get up.

704
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:03,372
Let's go.

705
01:10:03,582 --> 01:10:05,492
- Let's go!
- I'll go tomorrow.

706
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,452
- Enough already.
- What are you doing here?

707
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:08,382
Quiet.

708
01:10:08,582 --> 01:10:11,022
- Leave me and get out of here.
- I don't want to go without you.

709
01:10:11,222 --> 01:10:13,342
- Get up!
- Please, enough already.

710
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,372
- Get up!
- Enough already!

711
01:10:15,582 --> 01:10:16,412
Enough!

712
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:18,462
- Go!
- Said!

713
01:10:18,622 --> 01:10:19,342
Said!

714
01:10:19,822 --> 01:10:20,492
Said!

715
01:10:21,942 --> 01:10:22,692
Said!

716
01:10:32,743 --> 01:10:33,463
Stop!

717
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,703
Stop!

718
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:36,903
Enough already!

719
01:11:24,782 --> 01:11:25,982
Does it still hurt?

720
01:11:26,622 --> 01:11:27,342
No.

721
01:11:30,142 --> 01:11:31,212
And now what?

722
01:11:32,062 --> 01:11:32,893
You'll see.

723
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:35,013
It depends on you.

724
01:11:36,742 --> 01:11:37,942
What are you saying?

725
01:11:38,622 --> 01:11:41,852
The impediments to the operation
have disappeared.

726
01:11:42,462 --> 01:11:45,262
If you want,
you can still go out.

727
01:11:50,902 --> 01:11:52,222
What happened to Said?

728
01:11:52,382 --> 01:11:54,532
There's no problem,
he's passed the test.

729
01:11:55,902 --> 01:11:56,732
What's wrong?

730
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,222
I've got to speak with Said.

731
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:03,462
- I want to see him.
- It's not necessary.

732
01:12:04,302 --> 01:12:06,582
You should decide if you are going
or staying.

733
01:12:17,862 --> 01:12:18,982
Listen, Said.

734
01:12:21,342 --> 01:12:24,862
You know how much it costs us
and the risks we are running.

735
01:12:26,902 --> 01:12:28,972
Because of you,
everything has been ruined.

736
01:12:30,662 --> 01:12:33,571
Now I can't go with you.

737
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:35,931
I'm sorry.

738
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:38,371
It's better that you go.

739
01:12:45,222 --> 01:12:46,102
I was born

740
01:12:47,662 --> 01:12:49,222
in a refugee camp.

741
01:12:51,382 --> 01:12:54,582
I've only been able to leave
the West Bank one time.

742
01:12:55,982 --> 01:12:57,302
I was six years old.

743
01:12:58,462 --> 01:13:00,692
It was to have an operation.

744
01:13:01,422 --> 01:13:02,462
Just that once.

745
01:13:04,222 --> 01:13:07,742
Living here
is like living in a jail.

746
01:13:10,502 --> 01:13:14,132
The crimes of the occupation
are countless.

747
01:13:15,422 --> 01:13:16,652
But the worst of all

748
01:13:17,822 --> 01:13:19,862
is exploiting the weakness
of the people.

749
01:13:22,822 --> 01:13:25,622
And converting them into collaborators.

750
01:13:26,661 --> 01:13:28,651
They're not only crushing
the resistance,

751
01:13:29,421 --> 01:13:32,461
but also the families,
the dignity of our people.

752
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:37,331
When my father

753
01:13:38,901 --> 01:13:39,891
was executed,

754
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:42,501
I was ten years old.

755
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:45,461
He was a good man.

756
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:48,371
He became weak.

757
01:13:51,422 --> 01:13:53,572
The occupation was to blame

758
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:55,502
for what happened.

759
01:13:56,622 --> 01:13:59,532
They've got to understand
that if they recruit collaborators

760
01:14:00,262 --> 01:14:01,222
they will pay

761
01:14:02,702 --> 01:14:04,262
the price.

762
01:14:07,422 --> 01:14:08,742
It's not worth living
without dignity.

763
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:11,932
Above all

764
01:14:13,422 --> 01:14:17,262
If we remember, day after day,
our humiliation,

765
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:20,052
our weakness,

766
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,421
while the world watches,

767
01:14:28,581 --> 01:14:29,861
cowardice and indifference.

768
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:34,741
When a people find themselves
alone before the oppressor,

769
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:39,611
no other remedy remains
but to stop the injustice.

770
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:44,061
They must understand,

771
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:47,021
if we don't have security,
they don't either.

772
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:49,021
Not to use power.

773
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,381
Their power serves no purpose.

774
01:14:58,022 --> 01:15:00,012
I intend to deliver them the message,

775
01:15:00,182 --> 01:15:03,302
but only this form occurs to me
to deliver it.

776
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:07,142
Worse still,
they've convinced the world

777
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:10,622
and themselves,
that they're the victims.

778
01:15:11,902 --> 01:15:14,212
Is it possible to be an oppressor
and a victim at the same time?

779
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:20,021
But if they've already awarded themselves
the role of oppressor and victim,

780
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:23,491
it leaves no other remedy

781
01:15:23,661 --> 01:15:26,101
than to be a victim

782
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:29,661
and also a killer.

783
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:35,901
I don't know what will be your decision,

784
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:38,461
but I will not be a refugee.

785
01:15:45,701 --> 01:15:46,531
I'm going to pray.

786
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:44,541
Said!

787
01:16:45,741 --> 01:16:46,571
Said!

788
01:16:49,821 --> 01:16:51,051
What have you decided?

789
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:02,371
Where is he?

790
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:37,251
I'm sorry.

791
01:18:39,821 --> 01:18:40,621
Good luck.

792
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:54,450
Said, listen.

793
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,490
Said!

794
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,900
Said, listen to me.

795
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,860
- Said, listen.
- What do you want?

796
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,660
- Why have you come?
- For you.

797
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,890
Let's go back, back, Suha is right.

798
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,220
This way, we will not win.

799
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,140
We do what we must,
Allah is in charge of the rest.

800
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,860
Allah says: "Pause and reflect".

801
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,330
We kill and they kill us,
nothing changes.

802
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,900
We will die,

803
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,860
but the resistance will continue.

804
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,700
I don't have a choice.

805
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,500
And if you don't change anything?
If nothing changes?

806
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:31,101
There are other methods
of freedom and resistance.

807
01:19:31,261 --> 01:19:32,491
Maybe for others.

808
01:19:33,621 --> 01:19:34,581
For you also.

809
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:36,941
Come back with me,
I won't leave you here.

810
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:39,411
I won't let you die,
I won't allow it.

811
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:10,490
Talk.

812
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,780
Talk!

813
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:04,570
Go!

814
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,050
Said, open the door!

815
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,130
Open!

816
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,140
Come on, Said!

817
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,130
Go!
