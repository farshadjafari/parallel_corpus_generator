1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:03:12,000
BLACK SWAN

2
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,964
 dreamed a 
crazy dreams last night 

3
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,314
dance the white swan 

4
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:24,278
It was a different choreography from which we learned 

5
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,919
.That was the prologue 

6
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,741
when Park cast his spell 

7
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:45,166
Look how pink and pretty ... 

8
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,965
.. pretty .. 

9
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,025
You're in a good mood -
He promised to give me more this season - 

10
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,238
Well, he certainly should 

11
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:56,167
I've been there enough 

12
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,052
and you are more dedicated dancer in the company 

13
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:04,419
Top 

14
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,288
 What's this? -
Why? - 

15
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:08,487
there 

16
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:12,933
Nothing 

17
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,855
 you're sure you do not want me to come with you? 

18
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,046
You're a nice girl 

19
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,301
Have you seen  Beth today? 

20
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,575
can not believe that she's back 

21
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,958
 certainly have returned -
And why? Can not do a guess? - 

22
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:47,196
the company is broke, no one comes to see anyone 

23
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:49,883
No, that depends on the Ballet. Full stop. 

24
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,300
 this is not true, I have heard that it
One of the best 

25
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,251
 need something new to experimental
That's all 

26
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:57,953
No, no one knows 

27
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,124
 Like who? -
Like a person can not achieve the standards - 

28
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,592
This is sad 

29
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:05,259
 what is sad? 

30
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:11,493
Beth is a beautiful dancer 

31
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,064
Yes, my grandmother also 

32
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,607
debutante in the 15 -
Yes, we know - 

33
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,033
wonderful 

34
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,560
started losing my place 

35
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,015
This is different 

36
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,314
beautiful as usual Nina 

37
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,581
Relax 

38
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,198
one, two, three, four 

39
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:41,722
.. all for a moment 

40
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,509
Well, take your place 

41
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:58,495
One, two, three, Top 

42
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,954
One, two, three, four 

43
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,259
hello, dear 

44
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,933
We all know the story 

45
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,678
little girl virgin nice and clean 

46
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:30,348
trapped in the body of a swan 

47
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:33,856
seeks to Freedom 

48
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,829
and true love alone can break the spell 

49
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,172
 achieved her wish almost
By Prince 

50
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:49,376
But before he confessed his love 

51
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:55,491
 twin sister black swan, come
Beth and you 

52
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:05,370
leave the place and the White Swan is broken 

53
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:10,334
are killing themselves, and in death 

54
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:13,161
find freedom 

55
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,411
Good morning, the company 

56
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:21,747
Good morning 

57
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:26,035
We will open our season, Swan Lake 

58
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,264
They represent a lot of before, I know 

59
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,864
but not this way 

60
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,732
Sweep it will place, and we have the emergence 

61
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,653
new product, needs a new queen of swans 

62
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,402
new face to present to the world 

63
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:50,637
 However, any one of you, you can
 reflect 

64
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:54,005
White Swan, and Black 

65
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,027

 Why? 

74
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,052
 guess this means that the White Swan must
To be you 

75
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,074
but I'm not as well 

76
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,850
Dear Maestro, non-music

Now show me the black swan Nina 

78
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:27,255

There is nothing wrong 

88
00:13:58,779 --> 00:13:59,951
I'm ready 

89
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:03,313
 Do I have to do that again? 

90
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,232
No, thanks, I've seen enough 

91
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,829

98
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,014
If

114
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,660

perhaps you can to dance the role of the cat 

119
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,233
This will be the prize 

120
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:59,978

121
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:03,946
In any case, you will remain

 Do you have a minute? 

128
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:52,411
This is not a good time -
No, it is one of the officers - 

129
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:56,343
If 

130
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:01,342

139
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:27,776
Well, thank you 

140
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:31,681
This is the only 

141
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:34,202
 will not try to change me my opinion? 

142
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,604
You must be thought that this is possible 

143
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:40,898
Otherwise, what are you doing here? In this place 

144
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,098
have come to ask signed role 

145
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:50,566
Well 

146
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,533
The truth is 

147
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:57,470
 Anddma see you
What I see is the White Swan 

148
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,855
Yes, you are beautiful 

149
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,527
notice 

150
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,886
 but black swan
This work is always difficult to dance 

151
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,580
can dance the role of the black swan 

152
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:12,718
 really? 

153
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,809
 during four years at each
Once you dance 

154
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:20,692
 I see that you are obsessed with correcting
Aharakat all, but do not you relax yourself 

155
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:24,814
 never, all this lack of discipline for what? 

156
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:30,251
just wanted to be a complete 

157
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:33,067
want to be complete 

158
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:38,219
perfection is not about control only 

159
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,844
is also about to forget it 

160
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:46,509
 way that you can surprise the public by
The heart of events 

161
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,756
and few people have this 

162
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,372
think I do 

163
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:00,210
Eddtni have 

164
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:03,312
can not believe, I have Eddtni 

165
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,918
I'm sorry 

166
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:07,129
It hurt me that much 

167
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,743
 Why? 

168
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:26,952

169
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:33,907

170
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,659

 not said this? 

173
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:05,604
 Is this your style of bad joke? 

174
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,004
 Why? 

175
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:09,471
Woe to you 

176
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:24,439

00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:52,225
It's crazy 

344
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,268
We should be concerned by the Sit 

345
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:56,656

346
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,716
This is great, do not hide

 this role, is not it?
All this pressure 

351
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,242
 I knew that this would be an exaggeration
Tags, I know this 

352
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:18,514
you're okay 

353
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:21,884

354
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:31,875
Beth 

355
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:40,386
 What happened? 

356
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:44,725
 while she was heading to the studio
Hit by a car 

357
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:47,972
You know why 

358
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:51,723
am confident that it has done this intentionally 

359
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:54,246
How do you know 

360
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:58,965
 because everything you do Beth comes from the
Darkness internal 

361
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,878
think that this, which makes it exciting to see 

362
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:05,500
because it is serious 

363
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:08,932
it be wonderful sometimes 

364
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,250
but very confused 

365
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,384
 Was this after we saw? 

366
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:22,298
Hey, this has nothing to do with your 

367
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,444
This is not your problem, so I do not claim this  

368
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:28,671
This is your moment, Nina 

369
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:31,053
does not justify them slip away from you 

370
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:01,886
 what are you doing? 

371
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:44,363
