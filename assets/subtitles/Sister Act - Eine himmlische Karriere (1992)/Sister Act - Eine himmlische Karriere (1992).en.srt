2
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,812
Yes, Deloris?

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,523
John, Paul, George,

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,651
and Ringo.

5
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:35,284
Deloris Wilson, you are the most unruly,
disobedient girl in this school.

6
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,370
Now, I want you to march right up
to that blackboard

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:43,459
and write the names
of all the apostles alphabetically.

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,894
This is enough!

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,440
You are hopeless
and I wash my hands of you.

10
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,233
Mark my words, Deloris.

11
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,654
If you continue on this disruptive track,
it will lead straight to the devil.

12
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:17,076
Have you any idea
what girls like you become?

13
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,036
All right, wrap this up, okay?
Wrap it up.

14
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,910
Go!

15
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,638
Goodnight, ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,849
You don't give a shit!
Let's get the hell out of here.

17
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,408
So I guess eating
is out of the question, huh?

18
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,868
Your next show is in 20 minutes.

19
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,079
You still haven't told me what she said.

20
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,957
What who said?

21
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,794
"What who said." The one with
the moustache. The one you're married to.

22
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,675
- You are so damn hot.
- And you are so full of it.

23
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,388
You didn't tell her, did you? I knew it.
I knew you weren't gonna tell her. I knew it.

24
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,519
I want us to be together, babe.

25
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,440
I want us to be an honest
and decent couple.

26
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,983
I do.

27
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,068
I went to confession today.

28
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,864
You went to confession?
Like "confession" confession?

29
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,035
You know, where you kneel in the box,
you tell the priest your deepest secrets.

30
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,162
I did that today for us, babe.

31
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,583
I told Father Antonelli I was in love
and that it was a special love.

32
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,711
A love for all the ages
and that I want to be with her.

33
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,005
And what did he say?

34
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,508
He said that f I got divorced,
I'd burn in hell for all eternity.

35
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,929
- Hand me my loafers, darling.
- No, you can get your own damn shoes.

36
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,933
So, what does this mean?
Is this no? Does this mean no?

37
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,520
- What does it mean?
- No, not no. Just not now!

38
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,982
Just get out, okay? Just go.

39
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,320
You want me to go against a priest?

40
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,491
Get excommunicated?

41
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,996
Okay.

42
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,250
I'll eat the thing you made.

43
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,921
- Is that what this is about?
- No, that's not what it's about.

44
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,674
It's about you leaving.
Good night. Good night.

45
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,888
I'll call.

46
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,944
You're quitting just because
he won't leave his wife?

47
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,113
No, not just because
he won't leave his wife.

48
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,157
I'm quitting for a lot of reasons.
It's something I have to do.

49
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,618
- What's gonna happen to the act?
- What do you mean?

50
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,079
You're gonna get somebody else.
It's not a big loss.

51
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,497
You put everything together.

52
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,250
You pick all the music,
you tell us where to stand and everything.

53
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,129
Yeah, yeah, I'm a real genius.
That's why we're packing them in.

54
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,840
And don't you pack any more
of my makeup in that bag.

55
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,259
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

56
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,885
What do you want?

57
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,263
And don't you ever knock?

58
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,975
Hey, girl, you ain't got nothing
that I haven't seen before, all right?

59
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,310
Yeah, well, stop trying to memorise it.

60
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,396
- Hey, Michelle.
- Oh, please.

61
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,690
Hey, Deloris, here, This is from Vince.

62
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,192
Hope it's his dead body.

63
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,486
- With love.
- Oh, really?

64
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,697
- Yeah.
- Then why didn't he bring it to me himself?

65
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,991
Oh, he wanted to,
but he's got a big meeting upstairs.

66
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,410
- Hey, Tina.
- Hi.

67
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,412
Could you say goodnight
to these clowns, please?

68
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,123
I'm getting a headache.
I don't want them in here. Get out.

69
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,917
- Let's go.
- All right, I'm going.

70
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,670
Take it easy.

71
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,925
Well, at least you got something
out of all this.

72
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,094
- Come on, Deloris, open this up.
- Yes.

73
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,473
Why should I open this? I don't give
a damn what's in that box. I don't care.

74
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,016
- See what he bought.
- I wanna see.

75
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,435
- Why? Why?
- I wanna see.

76
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,521
Fine, okay?
Let's look and see what it is, then.

77
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,275
- Oh, look at this. It's mink.
- Oh, check it out.

78
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,819
It's purple mink, Deloris.

79
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,073
Oh, that's beautiful. Look. Feel.

80
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,541
Well, obviously,
Mr. LaRocca feels he can win me back

81
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:28,256
by sending me this absolutely
fabulous coat.

82
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,675
- Put it on!
- It's beautiful.

83
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,471
See, some girls would fall for that,
but not me.

84
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,350
I think I'm gonna make him wait a little
while before I just let him know that I...

85
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,477
What?

86
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,859
Connie LaRocca.

87
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,196
It's his wife's coat.

88
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,699
The man gave me his wife's coat.

89
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,160
Oh, I don't believe this.

90
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,039
Put it back on.
It's yours now. You deserve it.

91
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,584
No, I don't deserve it.
I haven't earned it.

92
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:09,506
You don't earn other people's
wives' fur coats, okay?

93
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,051
I think it's time to just go upstairs
and give it back to him

94
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,762
and get the hell out of this dump.

95
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,268
How long you been with me, Ernie?

96
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,896
Three years, Mr. LaRocca.

97
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,649
Two as a croupier,
one as your personal limo driver.

98
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,945
Ernie, you know what's important to me?
What counts?

99
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,616
Loyalty, my man.
Loyalty is what counts to me.

100
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:41,538
- I've been very loyal, Mr. LaRocca.
- Gee, Ernie, that's not what I hear.

101
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,748
I hear you went down
to the police station last night

102
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,875
and talked with Lieutenant Souther.

103
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,546
I hear you were there
for over three hours.

104
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,049
I went.

105
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,385
I went, but I didn't tell him anything.

106
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,470
Again not what I heard.

107
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,852
Goodbye, Vince.
I'm leaving and don't try to stop me.

108
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,021
I'm going to L.A.
where it's nice and warm.

109
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,525
People don't need fur coats
from their boyfriends' wives' closet.

110
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:15,238
Goodbye, Vince. I'm going to Miami
where the sun shines.

111
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,992
I know they're trying
to get something on me, Ernie,

112
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,453
but so far
they've come up with bubkas.

113
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:27,792
They called Willy and Joey in there,
but they were out in 20 minutes.

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,295
What were you doing there
for three hours, Ernie?

115
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,508
I know you don't think I have any talent,
Vince, but I do.

116
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,345
And I'm gonna leave you
and I'm going to Chicago.

117
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,306
Tell me what you told Souther.

118
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,310
I won't be able to sleep tonight
if I don't know.

119
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,312
I've always wanted to go to New York.

120
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,231
I know if I went to New York,
I could get some things together, Vince.

121
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,026
I could. I could.

122
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,320
I could.

123
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,201
That's all I told them, I swear it.

124
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,996
Thanks, Ernie. Now I can sleep.

125
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,956
Say goodnight, Ernie.

126
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,501
No, no, no, that's--

127
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,468
Babe.

128
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,140
Deloris. Deloris. Is there a problem?

129
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,142
With the coat?

130
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,563
With the--? No, not with the coat.
The coat's fine.

131
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,027
It's fine. It's fine, thank you.

132
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,530
Is that why you came here tonight?
To thank me?

133
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,949
Yeah. Thank you.

134
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,870
And to say you're sorry.

135
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,873
About tonight and the things you said.

136
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,585
Forgotten. Completely.
You understand me?

137
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,379
Forgotten.

138
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,298
Of course. Of course, it's forgotten.

139
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,802
That's my girl. My girl in mink.

140
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,763
- Will you be home soon?
- Yeah, yeah.

141
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,267
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

142
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,480
Hey, Vince, is she okay?

143
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,526
I don't know, Vince.
She seemed kind of upset.

144
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,986
- She did?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,157
Bring her back now for a talk.

146
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,616
And if she runs, then what?

147
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,786
Take care of it.

148
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,375
Deloris!

149
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,180
Deloris, Vinny wants to talk!

150
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,648
- Which way?
- That way.

151
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,989
Hey, hey, taxi!

152
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,245
Hey, hey, hey.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Go, go, go!

153
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,556
And then Vince looks at Ernie
and says, "Say good night."

154
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,725
And then Vince looks at Joey
and Joey shot him.

155
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,229
I mean, he just shot him in the chair.
Just boom! He blew this guy away.

156
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,774
Sorry I'm late. I'm Lieutenant Souther.
Eddie Souther.

157
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,484
How do you do?
I'm Deloris Van Cartier.

158
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,821
Listen, this guy was a simple limo driver.
Right? He was a limo driver.

159
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,157
So maybe he made a couple wrong turns
in his life. That's no reason to kill him.

160
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,826
I've never seen anybody killed before.

161
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,704
Sometimes you pass on the freeway,
you see a couple of people dead--

162
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,249
Ms. Van Cartier,
you're Vince LaRocca's girlfriend, right?

163
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,169
Well, you could sort of--
Maybe. It depends how you look at it.

164
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,464
The guy just tried to kill me, so
I don't think that cements our relationship.

165
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,342
Well, you realise
he's a major underworld figure, don't you?

166
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,928
He's into drug-dealing,
money-laundering.

167
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,015
We've been investigating Mr. LaRocca
for the last 18 months.

168
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,351
We've got video tapes,
we've got surveillance photos.

169
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,062
Am I in any of those videos?

170
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,234
No, no, no. Criminal activity.
The tapes aren't enough to convict him.

171
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,862
Apparently there's a lot
you don't know about Vince.

172
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,324
I mean, the last two people that saw him
in action kind of disappeared.

173
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,534
What do you mean,
"kind of disappeared"?

174
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,037
Well, we found a piece here
and a piece there.

175
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,332
But don't you worry.
Here, have a cup of coffee.

176
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,961
You're safe now and we're gonna see
that you stay that way. That's our job.

177
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,255
If you help us, we can help you.

178
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,424
If you testify against Vince
about what you saw,

179
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,468
we can put him away
for the rest of his life.

180
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,347
Are you crazy? You're telling me this guy's
a mad criminal and you want me to testify?

181
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,765
Do you know what's gonna happen?

182
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,267
- He'll track me down and kill me.
- Can I call you Deloris?

183
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,227
Call me anything
as long as you keep me alive.

184
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,563
We wouldn't put you at risk
if we couldn't protect you.

185
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,607
- Right.
- It'll only take a couple of months

186
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,317
to get a court date.

187
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,070
Just a couple of months?
Only a couple--?

188
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,072
Why not a year?
How about a couple of decades?

189
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,574
Two months. We hide you out,
then you testify.

190
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,826
No, no, no.

191
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,245
It's just for a little while.
Then you can come back.

192
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,664
Really? What are you gonna do?

193
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,541
Are you gonna stick me in a bag
and bury me? Forget it!

194
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,669
If you testify,

195
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,216
I'm gonna put you in the last place on earth
that Vince would ever look for you.

196
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,903
- Nice church, huh?
- Yeah, it's very nice.

197
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,448
Look, what am I gonna be,
Quasimodo in the bat belfry? What is this?

198
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,077
- I want you to stay here for a while.
- Where?

199
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,330
In the convent.
It's the safest place in the world.

200
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,541
You think Vince is gonna look for you
in a convent?

201
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,459
- In the what?
- The convent.

202
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,379
You must be out your-- I'm gonna go back
and work this out with Vince.

203
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,549
You're a lunatic. Put me in a damn
convent with these people.

204
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,260
These people don't even have sex!

205
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,265
Deloris, Vince has a contract
out on you for 1 00 grand.

206
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,268
You've seen what he can do.
That one bullet, that's all it's gonna take.

207
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,311
Look, let me explain something to you.

208
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,481
Vince knows people all over the place.
You realise that?

209
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,526
- He'll be looking for me everywhere.
- Everywhere but this convent!

210
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,154
- Oh, come on.
- Nobody knows you're here but me.

211
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,282
We're trying to get you a quick court date.
One month, two months tops.

212
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,326
I promise I'm gonna spring you
as fast as I can.

213
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,288
What am I gonna do here?
I'm gonna go crazy here.

214
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,874
There's nothing here but a lot
of white women dressed as nuns.

215
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,125
What am I gonna do here?

216
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,753
Pray.

217
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,629
Pray?

218
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,507
Yes, but, monsignor,
we are a small convent.

219
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,551
Surely there are more
appropriate places.

220
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,430
We can save this young woman's life
and imprison a parasite, all in one gesture.

221
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,265
My heart goes out to her, of course.

222
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,810
My concern would be
she might subject the convent to danger.

223
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,064
The Reno Police Department assures me
you'll be protected from any harm.

224
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,816
They've promised
to make a generous financial donation.

225
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,778
And as you know,
your small convent is in danger of closing.

226
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,825
Well, if they can afford
to be so generous, so can we.

227
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,336
Excuse me.

228
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,673
Absolutely not. I couldn't possibly!

229
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,552
Think of it this way, reverend mother.
She's an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

230
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,137
That is not a person you can hide.

231
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,015
That is a conspicuous person
designed to stick out.

232
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,020
You have taken a vow of hospitality
to all in need.

233
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,981
I lied.

234
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,698
Lieutenant Souther,
everything is in order.

235
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,619
No, no, no, everything is not in order.
This woman does not like me.

236
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,788
Deloris, these are holy people.
They like everybody.

237
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,583
- This woman doesn't like me!
- One month, two months, tops.

238
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,460
No, forget it. I'm not staying here!

239
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,630
- Behave yourself.
- I'm not gonna stay here!

240
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,606
What is your name?

241
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,650
Deloris Van Cartier.

242
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,819
Is that your real name?

243
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,904
Yes. I happen to be a singer.

244
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,200
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

245
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,786
Look, before we get started,

246
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,706
I just want to say that I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

247
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,958
I know it must be
a huge inconvenience for you.

248
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,212
Yeah, so I just wanted
to say thank you upfront.

249
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,218
I also have always--

250
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,181
And I've said this to people.
I've always admired you people.

251
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,016
Nuns, I mean. You know.

252
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,270
You're so Catholic. You know?

253
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,983
I mean, look, you're married to the big JC.
I mean, you're his old lady, you know?

254
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,110
It's an amazing thing to me.

255
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,737
I mean, of course you must be saying,

256
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,115
"Well, it's much better than being
hooked up with some kind of two-timing--"

257
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,076
Please, do not smoke in here.

258
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,663
Oh, sorry, sorry. You know,
I get so nervous, I get worked up.

259
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,791
I just have-- I don't know. I'm sorry.

260
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,379
Look, Ms. Van Cartier, we have agreed
to conceal and protect you,

261
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,382
which we will do
to the best of our ability.

262
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,885
However it is essential
that you understand

263
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,347
that you are not in a sorority
or a speakeasy.

264
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,309
This is a convent. A religious order.

265
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,020
And there are certain rules
you must obey.

266
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,358
Saint Katherine's is a place
to commune and to pray.

267
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,987
And I will not tolerate any disruption
whatsoever with that communion.

268
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,156
Do you understand?

269
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,825
- Yes.
- Good.

270
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,370
But do you understand
I'm the victim here?

271
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,038
Do you understand I'm the good guy?

272
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,959
I mean, they just kind of threw me
in here with you nuns.

273
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,503
I mean, do you get that?
I'm the good guy.

274
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,880
I mean,
I saw a guy get his face blown off!

275
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,634
So why don't you just give me the key
to my room? I'll lay low.

276
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,803
You stay out of my face,
I'll stay out of your face.

277
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,347
And I will commune my little black ass
in that room.

278
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,516
Can you handle that?

279
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,479
- I think it's a very good idea.
- Thank you.

280
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:18,776
Well, it's almost lunchtime.
Perhaps you'd like to freshen up.

281
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,779
And you'll certainly want to change.

282
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,573
Hope you don't think
I'll wear what I wore in Catholic school.

283
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,076
No, siree.
No ugly green jumpers for me.

284
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,120
And those stupid clunky shoes.

285
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,540
Oh, this gold thing,
could you have it dry-cleaned for me?

286
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,211
Open the cabinet to your left.
You will find suitable attire.

287
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,088
Oh, cool.

288
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,558
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

289
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,395
This is fine for covering a little bulge,
but now I've got holster hips.

290
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,522
People wish to kill you.

291
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,482
Anyone who's met you, I imagine.

292
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,403
A disguise is necessary
to protect us all.

293
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,864
While you are here,
you will conduct yourself as a nun.

294
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,533
Only I will know
who and what you truly are.

295
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,244
You will draw no attention
to yourself whatsoever.

296
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,205
But look at me! I'm a nun!
I'm a penguin!

297
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,710
As from now and until you leave,
you are Sister Mary Clarence.

298
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,886
Mary Clarence like Clarence Williams III
from The Mod Squad?

299
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,472
Mary is in deference to our Holy Mother.

300
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,142
The Clarence is in honour
of Saint Clarence of Concordia.

301
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,061
There are three vows
every nun must accept.

302
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,106
The vow of poverty, the vow of obedience,
and the vow of chastity.

303
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,650
I am out of here with that.

304
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,319
Oh, man.

305
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,576
Good afternoon, sisters.
I apologise for my tardiness.

306
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:56,290
I would like you to welcome a new member
to our house. Sister Mary Clarence.

307
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:04,548
Mary Clarence comes to us
from a somewhat progressive convent.

308
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,594
However she's eager
to embrace a more disciplined life

309
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,223
and I am sure will make every effort
to conform to our ways.

310
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,849
I'll do my best.

311
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,894
- Would you like to be seated?
- Thank you.

312
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,577
Yes, Mary Patrick?

313
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,206
Reverend mother, on behalf of
all of the sisters here at Saint Katherine's,

314
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:41,961
I'd like to offer a great, big "hi there
and hello" to Sister Mary Clarence. Hi.

315
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,379
And as part of the welcome,

316
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,216
I thought that maybe our new sister
could offer today's blessing.

317
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,553
That is very thoughtful of you,
Mary Patrick, but I really--

318
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,848
Oh, yeah, yeah, I could do that. Sure.

319
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:01,355
Bless us, O Lord, for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive.

320
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:10,156
And, yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of no food,

321
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,742
I will fear no hunger.

322
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,289
We want you to give us this day
our daily bread

323
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:23,461
and to the republic for which it stands
and by the power invested in me,

324
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,882
I pronounce us ready to eat. Amen.

325
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,425
Amen.

326
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,552
Be seated.

327
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,564
Thank you.

328
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,585
What are you people?
This stuff is terrible! It tastes like sh--

329
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,547
Sisters, we shall spend
the rest of the day in silence.

330
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,341
Why?

331
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,346
Only when our lips are silent
may our prayers truly be answered.

332
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,264
Then you don't have to eat this food.

333
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,561
Silence begins now
and ends at sundown.

334
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,147
How can you eat this stuff? It's terrible.

335
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:30,069
Mary Clarence,
I think you might enjoy a ritual fast.

336
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,988
A ritual fa--?
No, no, no, I don't think I would.

337
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:37,409
I'll just put a little salt on it. It'll be fine.
Look. Pass me the salt over there.

338
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,498
A fast. To remind you of those
who must endure without food.

339
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,420
No, I don't want you to take my plate.

340
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,589
And silence.

341
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,694
How can you let them grill me
for six hours?

342
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,654
I can't control
how long they question you.

343
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,032
- Did you go to law school?
- Yes, I went to law school.

344
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,118
- Did you graduate?
- I'm a lawyer. Of course I graduated!

345
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,620
Hey, Vince.

346
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,665
Nice talking to you. See you in court.

347
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,795
You got nothing on me, Souther.
If you don't stop harassing me, I'm gonna--

348
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,380
What? You're gonna what?

349
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,551
Nothing, nothing, lieutenant.
What my client is trying to say--

350
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,178
Is that he's scared.

351
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:23,974
And you know what?
He should be. Real scared.

352
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,852
See you around, boys.

353
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,651
Something's going on.

354
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,528
He's so damn cocky.

355
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,698
He's bluffing, Vince.
Don't worry about it.

356
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,243
You find Deloris?

357
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,081
She's gone. We don't know where she is.
She hasn't been back to her place all day.

358
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,625
He's got Deloris.

359
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,794
We gotta get her back.

360
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,505
Fax her 8-by-10 to every contact we got.

361
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,049
- I can't hear this.
- Deloris Van Cartier.

362
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,677
Quarter of a mil, dead or alive.

363
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,184
This is your cell, Mary Clarence.

364
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,438
- My what?
- Your cell. Your room.

365
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,486
Oh, man.

366
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,990
No wonder you waited till now
to spring this on me.

367
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,494
It's like a nightmare.
Where's the rest of the furniture?

368
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:30,916
Our lives are simple. We have little need
for material possessions.

369
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,753
This is out of the Stone Age.
Where's the phone?

370
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,797
Who would you call?

371
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,467
I don't know. Satan?

372
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,970
Your cell is more than adequate.

373
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,348
Fine. What do we do now?
Pray? What?

374
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,767
It's 9:00. Pleasant dreams.

375
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,146
Wait! Are you telling me
we go to bed by 9?

376
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:56,984
If I were you, I would use this time
to think about my life and its direction.

377
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,944
Or lack thereof.

378
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,529
There's nothing wrong with my life.

379
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,948
Before I came here,
I had a career, I had friends.

380
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,785
I had clothing that fit.
Before I came here, I was okay.

381
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,287
Oh, really?

382
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,791
From what I've heard, your singing career
was almost nonexistent.

383
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,669
And your married lover wants you dead.

384
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,089
If you're fooling anyone,
it is only yourself.

385
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,718
God has brought you here.

386
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,262
Take the hint.

387
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,189
Mary Clarence?

388
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,525
What?

389
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,612
Up and at them.
We don't want to be late.

390
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,947
What time is it?

391
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,741
Well, it's almost 5, Sister Sleepyhead.

392
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,535
Five a.m.?

393
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:33,330
Get out of here. I just went to bed
20 minutes ago. Scram.

394
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,708
Come on, the sun is shining.
It's a beautiful day.

395
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,257
We are a small congregation
this morning.

396
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,595
Too many mornings.
Something has gone terribly wrong.

397
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:54,184
Where is faith? Where is celebration?
Where is everyone?

398
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,479
Still, rather than regret
the absence of our neighbours,

399
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:02,234
let us rejoice in the fellowship
of those present.

400
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,237
Our choir mistress,
Sister Mary Lazarus,

401
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,740
has informed me that our choir,
while always superior,

402
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,203
has been toiling especially hard
on this week's selection.

403
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,830
Sister.

404
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,543
There was a raid on a pawn shop
in L.A. this morning.

405
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,838
Place was fencing stolen property.
They found this.

406
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,051
Database hoods.
What a wonderful world, huh?

407
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,346
"Beloved daughter missing.
Reward of $250,000.

408
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,308
Please, find our adored angel.
We miss her so. Dead or alive."

409
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,853
Vince is getting desperate.
So where'd you stash her, Eddie?

410
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,480
Where did I stash who?

411
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,899
You're not even gonna tell us?

412
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,735
I wouldn't even tell the pope.

413
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:22,582
I'm not gonna get this.
This is a little too complicated for me.

414
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,168
Don't you worry, you'll get the hang of it.
I'll help you.

415
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,337
Thank you.

416
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,006
Are you always this cheerful?

417
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,757
Am I?

418
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,051
All right, I am. I know it.

419
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,805
I can't help it. I've always been upbeat.
Optimistic, perky.

420
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,600
Even as a child, my mother used to say,
"That girl is pure sunshine.

421
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,228
She'll either grow up to be a nun
or a stewardess."

422
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,188
Coffee?

423
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,277
- Enough about me. What about you?
- Yes, what convent did you come from?

424
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:56,491
I came from the convent

425
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:00,912
of the Sisters of the Moonlite in Reno.

426
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,123
Oh, I love Reno.

427
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,625
- You do?
- Yes.

428
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:10,380
Well, you would have loved us.
We were a kind of pioneering order.

429
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:16,219
You know, we'd never wear any kind of
habit this tight, though. This is really tight.

430
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,807
Oh, I must say, our habits
do cut you at the neck just a bit.

431
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,018
Hear, hear!

432
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,145
That's enough jabber.

433
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,981
Vanity. A progressive convent?

434
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,693
Sounds awful.
I liked my convent in Vancouver.

435
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:36,239
Out in the woods. Wasn't all modern
like some of these newfangled convents.

436
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,619
We didn't have electricity.
Cold water, bare feet. Those were nuns.

437
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,412
Sounds wonderful.

438
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,249
It was hell on earth. I loved it.
This place is a Hilton.

439
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,836
Sister Mary Clarence,
when did you get your call?

440
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,255
What call?

441
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,551
Oh, the call, the call!
I didn't know which call you meant.

442
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,554
I was working in Reno
when I got the call.

443
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:04,309
And you don't know how hard it is
to get a call until you've worked in Reno.

444
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,896
We ministered to
a lot of different kinds of people.

445
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,483
Newlyweds, hookers, gamblers.

446
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,653
What a joy. How fulfilling to be able
to get right in there with your hands

447
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,113
and work with the people.

448
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,866
- And Reno. It's probably bursting with sin.
- It was. That's why I had to leave.

449
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:25,330
I mean, we had a hooker living next door
called Buckwheat Bertha who would--

450
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,375
Sister Mary Clarence,
could I have a word with you?

451
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,544
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

452
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,839
Yeah. Excuse me.

453
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,758
Get on with your work.

454
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,302
- Quickly, please.
- I was just talking to them.

455
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,098
Precisely. Enough chatter. Chores.

456
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:06,598
Yeah, I need to talk to Eddie Souther.
Yeah, it's an emergency.

457
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,227
- Souther.
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

458
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,895
You gotta get me out of here.

459
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,355
Deloris, you can't call me here.

460
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,523
Somebody's gonna catch on
to where you are.

461
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,193
But I'm going insane here.
All these people do is work and pray.

462
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,819
Work and pray. That's all they do.

463
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:24,115
Calm down. Look, I didn't want to
tell you this, we got some problems here.

464
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,534
What kind of problems?
What do you mean, problems?

465
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,161
Keeping our witnesses alive.

466
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,831
There's a leak in the department
and some of them end up dead.

467
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,376
- What?!
- Just sit tight.

468
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,920
You don't seem to understand
what I'm saying.

469
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:42,300
I am in a nightmare. This is my nightmare.
It's a nightmare, man. Get me out of here.

470
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,513
I mean it. Don't call me.
It's not safe. I'll be in touch.

471
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,266
Hello? Hello?

472
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,868
Yeah?

473
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,255
I brought you something.

474
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,382
My brother gave it to me
when I was a little girl.

475
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,342
I could never seem to get up on time.

476
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,345
I set it for 5.

477
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:32,684
Out of bed, you daisy head.
Out of bed, you daisy head.

478
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,185
It always made me laugh.

479
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,896
Out of bed, you daisy head.

480
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,276
I thought being away
from your convent

481
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,195
that even someone like you
could get lonely.

482
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,949
Have a seat.

483
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:58,251
- So which one are you?
- Mary Robert.

484
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,212
You have a little trouble getting up
at 5:00 too, Mary Robert?

485
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,884
Oh, not now. I get up a half an hour early
just to make sure.

486
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:10,263
It's not just the mornings.
It's that, all my life,

487
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,391
everybody seems to be doing
or catching on to things

488
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,894
a second faster or better than me.

489
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,522
Yeah, well, everybody's
playing catch-up nowadays.

490
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:25,403
So, Mary Robert.
Did you always want to be a nun?

491
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:31,159
I always knew that was my calling,
to lead a life of service, but, you see,

492
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:36,623
I've always felt that there's something
inside me that I want to give.

493
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,503
Something that's only me
and nobody else.

494
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:47,634
Does that sound like a terrible thing?
Like pride?

495
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:53,515
No, doesn't sound
like a terrible thing at all.

496
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:57,018
I'm so happy that you've come
to join us, Mary Clarence.

497
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:08,279
You know how sometimes it's as if
you have to be yourself or you'll just burst?

498
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,325
Yep, I do.

499
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,747
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mary Robert.

500
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:32,220
Out of bed, you daisy head.
Out of bed, you daisy head.

501
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,135
- Hey, wait up.
- Hey.

502
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,412
Nice tattoo.

503
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,087
Hey, sister.

504
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,007
This jukebox got anything on it
from The Sound Of Music?

505
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:13,238
- Wanna dance, sister?
- Why? You don't have any rhythm.

506
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,287
Young man,
take your foot down off that stool.

507
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,914
Now have a seat. Have a seat.

508
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,420
May I have a Coke, please?

509
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,355
What are you doing in here?

510
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:58,241
What are you guys doing here?
Look, you have to go. You have to go.

511
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,787
Oh, never mind. Go, go.
Just go that way. Just go that way.

512
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:08,293
Sister, expecting any more
of your friends?

513
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,380
Now, you guys wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

514
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,591
I thought that you might be
ministering to the winos,

515
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,719
the way that you did in your convent
in Reno, and I thought I could help.

516
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,513
And I saw her leave and it was very late,
so I followed.

517
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,640
What are you doing here?

518
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,895
I'm here to see a man
about a car for the convent.

519
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,105
- Really?
- Did you get it?

520
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,859
No, I didn't. And I'm gonna get you
out of here. Come on, come on, come on.

521
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,612
Oh, a jukebox! Oh, one song.

522
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,488
- Do you have a quarter?
- No, no, no.

523
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,366
Come on, he does, all right.
It'll come back to you tenfold. Thanks.

524
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,119
Hurry up. Hurry up.

525
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,082
I love this song.

526
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,213
One dance. I'll be right back.

527
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,092
Come on, come on, come on.

528
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,344
- No!
- Yes, yes, yes. Good night.

529
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,847
- Come on. Let's go, go.
- I love this song.

530
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,724
We had a lovely time. We'll be back.

531
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,811
- Yes, we will. Good night.
- Thank you. Bless you.

532
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,857
This turns into a nuns' bar,
I'm out of here.

533
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,779
- I can't breathe.
- Just come on, come on.

534
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,739
Stop the giggling. Let's go.

535
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:22,176
The sisters have made clear to me
that they followed you of their own volition.

536
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,430
But they would never have ventured out
at all at night

537
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,598
had it not been for your example.

538
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,768
Listen, they just don't want to be stuck
behind these walls all the time.

539
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,855
These walls are the only
protection they have.

540
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:39,152
The streets are no longer safe for them.
And they are certainly not safe for you.

541
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,698
These robes no longer protect our sisters.
The walls do.

542
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,075
I'm sorry.

543
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,871
You really do care about them,
don't you?

544
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,331
Yes, I do.

545
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,460
And I care about you and your life.

546
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,630
I shall ask Monsignor O'Hara
and Lieutenant Souther

547
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:03,009
to find a safer and more suitable
situation for you.

548
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,094
Oh, no, come on.
Don't send me away. Really.

549
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,096
I'm just starting to get the hang of this.

550
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:12,643
I mean, look, I'm not gonna endanger
anyone or anything else, I swear.

551
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,813
What about forgiveness?
lsn't that what you preach?

552
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,024
There's gotta be something around here
that I can do

553
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,985
that's not gonna chip my nails
or annoy anybody.

554
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,112
You're right, Mary Clarence.

555
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,408
To err is human, to forgive divine.

556
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,202
You may stay.

557
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:34,207
But I shall restrict your activities
to a single task.

558
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,919
What's that?

559
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,214
Singing. You will join the choir.

560
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,009
Choir? No.

561
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:49,722
You will sleep and you will sing.
That will be your task until you leave.

562
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,977
No. The choir?
I mean, have you heard them?

563
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,231
The choir, Mary Clarence.

564
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,275
Is this the choir rehearsal?

565
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,654
Sure is. Come in and sing a spell.

566
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,492
- Soprano or alto?
- Whatever.

567
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,160
Thanks.

568
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,916
- Hi there.
- Hello, sister.

569
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,929
Crown him with many crowns

570
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,224
The lamb upon his throne

571
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:37,478
All kingdoms of the--

572
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,981
Mary Clarence, are you with us?

573
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:45,945
I don't know this one.
I'd better sit this one out. Excuse me.

574
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,657
Reverend Mother says Mary Clarence
has a background in music.

575
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,494
Really, Mary Clarence?
Were you a choir mistress?

576
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:58,165
- Sort of freelance.
- Freelance? Really?

577
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:06,507
You don't think I see? You think I took
vows yesterday? I know what you're up to.

578
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:10,553
- You and Reverend Mother.
- What?

579
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:15,391
You're a ringer. She brought you here
to replace me. Out with the old.

580
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,812
Oh, could you help us, Mary Clarence?

581
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,523
Mary Lazarus, you're terrific,
but we could really use some help.

582
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,567
- Please, you've heard us.
- We're terrible.

583
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,654
Please, would you do something for us,
please?

584
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:34,285
Well, there's a word for this. Mutiny.

585
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,371
So, Mary Clarence,
you think you can do better?

586
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,416
I believe I'd like to see that.

587
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,920
Go ahead, sister. Make them sing.

588
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,620
Okay.

589
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,081
Where are the basses?

590
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,625
Oh, you should be over here.

591
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,253
And the altos? Where are you?

592
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:31,342
Sister, why don't you join them?
And, sopranos, where are you?

593
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,345
Oh, you've got to come down this way.

594
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,974
All right.

595
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,812
Basses, I want you to give me a D.

596
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,315
Altos, I want you to do a third above that.
Give me an F sharp.

597
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,777
And sopranos, give me an A.

598
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,571
Let me have Sister Alma
play it one time

599
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,493
so we all know what we're going to do
and we'll go from there.

600
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,496
Sister, will you give me
those notes, please?

601
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:10,881
Okay? On three. One, two, three.

602
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,301
Okay, okay, okay.

603
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,387
Very, very nice.

604
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,056
Sister, would you come
over here, please?

605
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:23,185
Just slide right in here for me, please.
Right here.

606
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,105
- That's a powerful instrument you have.
- Thank you.

607
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:31,068
But I think it's probably a good idea
if we bring you down out of the rafters.

608
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,404
I mean, everybody wants
to be close to God.

609
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,948
I'm just not sure you can do it vocally.

610
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,411
Okay? So I need you to sing an octave
below where you've been singing.

611
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,746
Okey-dokey.

612
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:45,416
And Sister Mary Robert,
could you come stand over here, please?

613
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,084
Yeah, come on over.

614
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:51,380
I noticed that you're moving your mouth,
but nothing's coming out.

615
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,800
So I'd like to just hear you by yourself,
if you don't mind.

616
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,012
Sister Alma,
could you give me an A, please?

617
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,017
Alma.

618
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,895
Check your battery.

619
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,690
Give me an A, please.

620
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,571
Okay. Wait.

621
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,492
Try this. Close your eyes.

622
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,995
Visualise yourself
in a room full of people.

623
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,624
Lots of silverware, people dropping stuff,
talking loud, drunks.

624
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,251
Women with trays going,
"What are you gonna have?"

625
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:33,130
Your voice has to carry over the din.

626
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,175
You have to get up over all of that
to be heard in the back of the room

627
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,554
where I'm sitting, listening,
straining to hear you. Okay?

628
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,558
Keep that in your mind when we do this.
Sister.

629
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,029
We call that an A with an attitude.

630
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,990
That's what you need.
You have to put attitude in what you sing.

631
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,700
Have to think
about what you're singing.

632
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,579
It's not just quacking. This is rejoicing.

633
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,666
You are singing to the Lord.

634
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,962
Let's review those notes again
and see if we can put it together. Sister.

635
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:19,343
Basses. Altos, sopranos.

636
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,429
On three. One, two, three.

637
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,938
Oh, we did it.
We actually sang a chord.

638
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,398
That was exciting.

639
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,276
Yeah, you sang a chord
for two seconds.

640
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:39,071
The next thing you have to learn how to do
is listen to each other.

641
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,115
That's a big key. Big key.

642
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,410
You must listen to each other
if you're going to be a group.

643
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,953
I knew that.

644
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,500
Mary Lazarus, as soon as I walked
in the door, I knew that you knew this.

645
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,754
Now, you're somebody who's
into hard work and discipline, aren't you?

646
00:52:55,922 --> 00:53:00,676
- Of course, I'm a nun. Four popes now.
- Four?

647
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,015
- How often do they rehearse?
- Twice a week, couple hours.

648
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,602
Not enough. I mean, listen to them.
They really need a lot of work.

649
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,729
They gotta rehearse every day.

650
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,564
She's good.

651
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,817
Well, do you think
they really could get better?

652
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:20,779
- I don't know. They're pretty raw.
- Wet behind the ears.

653
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,574
Oh, please, let us try.

654
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,621
- This is gonna be hell.
- Tell me about it.

655
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:58,400
Welcome this Sunday morning,
oh, ye few but faithful.

656
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,780
The choir, I'm told, has elected
a new director, Sister Mary Clarence,

657
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,408
who will lead them
in "Hail, Holy Queen."

658
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,397
- What do you think's going on up there?
- I don't know, man.

659
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:59,581
Hallelujah!

660
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:57,598
Girl groups? Boogie-woogie on the piano?
What were you thinking?

661
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,101
I was thinking more like Vegas.
You know, get some butts in the seats.

662
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:07,649
And what next? Popcorn, curtain calls?
This is not a theatre or a casino.

663
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,026
Yeah, but that's the problem.

664
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,862
See, people like going to theatres
and they like going to casinos.

665
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,073
But they don't like coming to church, why?
Because it's a drag.

666
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,243
But we can change all that.
See, we could pack this joint.

667
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:22,915
Through blasphemy?
You have corrupted the entire choir.

668
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,501
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

669
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:30,464
How can you say that?
I worked my butt off with these women!

670
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,467
They've given up their free time to do this
and they're good.

671
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,845
I mean, sister, we could rock this place!

672
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,096
Out of the question.

673
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:41,600
As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus
resumes her leadership of the choir.

674
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,310
Come in!

675
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,855
Reverend Mother,
I just wanted to congratulate you.

676
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:51,818
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.
What a marvellous program.

677
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,905
Innovative, inspiring.
You're to be commended.

678
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:58,242
I can't wait till next Sunday
when the choir performs again.

679
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,410
Did you see the people
walk in off the street?

680
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:05,332
That music, that heavenly music.
Reverend Mother, it called to them.

681
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,751
It did?

682
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,253
I must tell the archbishop.

683
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,089
I'll send him a personal letter
describing your efforts,

684
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,092
your bold new fight
to keep your little convent alive.

685
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,512
And you must also include this. This is
something she would never tell you herself,

686
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,597
because this is the kind
of woman she is.

687
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:25,227
Sisters, she wants us to go out into
the neighbourhood and meet the people.

688
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,983
- Oh, this woman.
- Oh, bless her.

689
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,777
There are so many problems out there
that we could maybe help with.

690
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,071
I mean,
that's why many of us became nuns.

691
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,282
Oh, it's really marvellous,
Reverend Mother.

692
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,159
There's a lot we could do for them
besides pray, sister.

693
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,869
You're a pioneer.

694
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:48,542
Monsignor, surely you realise
how dangerous this neighbourhood is.

695
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,336
And you will face that danger head-on.

696
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,881
- As if I could stop you.
- You couldn't.

697
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,217
You have my complete support
in this matter.

698
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:01,138
Anything you can do to revitalise
this neighbourhood would be a blessing.

699
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,474
Don't you just love her?

700
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,310
Yes.

701
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,338
Yes, the failing convent at
Saint Katherine's has truly come alive

702
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,757
thanks to the efforts of its popular choir.

703
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,842
What an amazing turnaround story.

704
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,888
This convent was once alienated
from its surrounding neighbours.

705
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,850
- Now, as you can see, its doors are open...
- Vinny, get over here.

706
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,313
--establishing facilities like a daycare
centre and a food kitchen for the homeless.

707
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,900
- As a matter of fact...
- Vin, you gotta see these cute nuns.

708
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,569
I'm shooting pool!

709
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,781
Babe, we should send them money.
They're do-gooders.

710
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,868
--attribute this reach-out philosophy
to a new addition to the convent

711
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:57,582
Sister Mary Clarence,
who, unfortunately, is a little camera shy.

712
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,586
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her myself.

713
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:07,717
In related news, the pope visits the U.S.
And we'll have more on that in a moment.

714
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,766
- Good morning.
- Thank you so much.

715
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,185
- Good morning, monsignor.
- Good morning.

716
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,687
- Good to see you.
- Good morning.

717
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,112
Hey, hey, you looking for me?
What you doing here?

718
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,948
- How come I saw you on TV?
- That was not my fault.

719
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:33,118
These people just showed up.
But it's been really good for the convent.

720
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,703
You're supposed to be hiding out.

721
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,080
Remember?
Bullets flying through the air at you?

722
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,666
- Ring a bell?
- Yes.

723
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,377
But I can't talk about it now.
I have a show in five minutes.

724
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,171
Listen to yourself.
This is not a career opportunity.

725
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,590
You don't have to tell me that.

726
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,717
This would not be the place
to begin a career.

727
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,054
Hey, just promise me I won't see you
on the Letterman show, okay?

728
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,181
Okay.

729
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:59,686
Hey, I'm worried about you.
I don't want to see anything happen to you.

730
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,315
Okay. You gonna come to the show?

731
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,651
Yeah. I'd love to.

732
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:15,911
This Sunday's hymn is inspired
by the lesson of Mary Magdalene.

733
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:19,664
Now, Mary Magdalene
was a young lady with a past.

734
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,877
Oh, yes.
And she was no stranger to sin.

735
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,630
She was no stranger
to practically anybody.

736
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:32,302
Many condemned her.
The whole neighbourhood, in fact.

737
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:36,473
But one man refused to do so.

738
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:41,186
One man said,
"Hey, now. Hold on. Wait a minute.

739
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:45,106
Listen to the girl's story."

740
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:55,992
- Hail, girls.
- Hail, Mary. What's up?

741
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,915
Well, Jerusalem's become a real drag.
Everybody hates me.

742
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,750
Not that guy over there.

743
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:08,380
Who, him? They all say he's different.
They say he's really weird.

744
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:12,467
We don't care what people say.
To us, he's always there.

745
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,927
Really?

746
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,698
Let's take it home, ladies.

747
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,081
Give them some of
that deep shoulder action.

748
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:40,949
- Ladies, ladies, you were fantastic.
- Sisters, you did good.

749
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,410
Oh, I'm so excited.
I can't wait till Sunday when we sing.

750
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:47,122
- I'd rather sing than do anything.
- It's better than ice cream.

751
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:50,125
- It's better than springtime.
- It's better than sex.

752
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,918
No, I've heard, you know.

753
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,629
Sisters, you're truly an inspiration.

754
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,924
And I've asked you here because
I bear remarkable news.

755
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,509
Now, try to remain calm.

756
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,720
What I'm about to say
is nothing short of a miracle.

757
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,764
Well, I didn't believe it myself at first.

758
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,350
Monsignor, for goodness' sake,
what is it?

759
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,646
Oh, I'm sorry, sister. It's just that it's so
momentous, I'm still adjusting to the shock.

760
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:16,442
The pope, the pope himself, has heard
of our choir here at Saint Katherine's.

761
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,862
And when he visits San Francisco
next weekend,

762
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,197
despite his inordinately busy schedule,

763
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,617
he's requested a special concert here
on Sunday night.

764
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,536
No, no!

765
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,788
Oh, I'm dying, I'm dying.

766
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:33,751
Oh, sisters.
Oh, sisters, this is indeed glorious news.

767
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:37,088
Oh, monsignor,
we're both humbled and honoured.

768
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,799
And on such a supremely
solemn occasion,

769
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,094
I do feel a traditional program
would be best.

770
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,513
You mean, traditional like the old way?

771
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,016
We're speaking of His Holiness,
Mary Clarence,

772
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,226
not a neighbourhood block party.

773
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:53,897
The pontiff commands
the utmost respect and humility.

774
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,609
Your more secular entertainments
would be totally out of place.

775
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,944
But, Reverend Mother,
everyone loves our new style.

776
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,821
It's brought people back to the church.

777
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,408
And that's why he's coming, because
we're doing something new and different.

778
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,286
Well, I feel this can be settled
by a simple vote.

779
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:11,372
- A vote?
- Of course, Mary Clarence.

780
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:13,917
A convent is not a police state.

781
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,793
I'm sure the sisters
are more than capable

782
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:19,172
of reaching a mature
and dignified consensus.

783
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,091
Right. Now all those in favour
of performing a program

784
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,469
of time-honoured, sacred music,

785
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:28,932
a truly spiritual repertoire,
raise your hands.

786
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,776
All those in favour of allowing
Mary Clarence

787
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:46,032
to select a more worldly program,
however inappropriate, raise your hands.

788
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,629
The majority has spoken.

789
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:04,050
Reverend Mother, as always, you're a true
leader. Gracious and understanding.

790
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,928
It's gonna be wonderful, Reverend Mother.
You'll see.

791
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,973
I'm sure the presentation
will be a great success.

792
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,100
Congratulations, Mary Clarence.

793
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:18,064
And congratulations to you all.

794
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:24,612
His Holiness.
Now, we've got to get busy.

795
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:29,534
Come in.

796
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,828
You sent for me?

797
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,040
- You have a phone call.
- From who?

798
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,501
Lieutenant Souther.

799
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,550
Hello.

800
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:49,554
Hey, Deloris, great news.
I pulled some strings.

801
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:53,308
The judge agreed to move up the trial.
We'll be in court in a couple days.

802
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,853
Really? That soon?

803
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,063
In 48 hours, you're a free woman.

804
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,400
Oh, that's great.

805
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,570
Yeah, that's great.

806
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,281
Hey, well, don't thank me or anything.

807
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:13,578
No, it is. No, thank you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.

808
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:17,582
Yeah. All right. Bye.

809
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:25,965
Well, seems like your prayers
have been answered.

810
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,718
Gonna be out of here in a week.
I'm leaving.

811
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,636
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

812
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,806
- That makes two of us.
- What do you mean?

813
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:38,686
I have submitted my resignation
to Monsignor O'Hara. Privately.

814
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,939
I've asked to be relocated
as soon as possible.

815
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,734
But why?

816
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,779
I must go where I can be of use.

817
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:53,368
But there's still
so much to be done here.

818
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,745
Look, if it's about me,
I'm gonna be gone.

819
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:59,832
Indeed. And after how long?
A few weeks?

820
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,584
I have been here for years.

821
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:05,713
Well, too long, I suppose.
I've become somewhat obsolete.

822
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:08,841
But you don't have to continue
being obsolete.

823
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:11,803
Look, everything that's happening here
is a good thing.

824
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:16,057
- Sister, you can still be part of it.
- Part of what?

825
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,893
Mary Clarence, it is one thing
to rabble-rouse,

826
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,646
to sweep into town
and declare a holiday.

827
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:26,526
You've raised the sisters' expectations.
You've excited and confused them.

828
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:30,530
They imagine this neighbourhood to be
some sort of delightful ongoing bake sale.

829
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,658
Now, you and I know things
are not so simple.

830
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:36,911
There'll be disappointments
and rude shocks.

831
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,748
And you will have vanished.
How fortunate.

832
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,627
Look, I just got things going.

833
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:48,631
You are a formidable woman.
You could keep this going.

834
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,425
Could I?

835
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:55,096
Even if I wanted to, no.
I fear I am a relic.

836
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,224
And I have misplaced my tambourine.

837
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,310
- Good day, Mary Clarence.
- But, sister--

838
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:08,359
Good day.

839
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,987
Don't peek.

840
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,991
Don't peek. Ready?

841
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,828
Crazy women. What have you done?
What is this?

842
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,122
- It's ice cream.
- I know that, but--

843
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,001
Well, it's a great big cuddly bear hug
of a thank-you from us to you.

844
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,881
Not thank you to me. Thank you to you.
I mean, when did you do this?

845
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:33,009
This is a sin. It's a wicked indulgence.

846
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,386
Didn't they have any butter pecan?

847
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:38,306
- Hope Reverend Mother doesn't catch us.
- Yeah, let's keep it down.

848
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,599
Is there any syrup?

849
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:44,312
Mary Clarence, this morning in prayers,
I thanked God for bringing you to us.

850
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,981
Since you've come,
everything has just happened.

851
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,442
Our choir is famous, for one.

852
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:53,404
We could cut a demo.
I could learn guitar.

853
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,699
Yeah, anything is possible.

854
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,868
- God works in mysterious ways.
- That's true.

855
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:02,747
You know, anything could happen.

856
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,542
I mean, any one of us could be transferred
out of here at any given time.

857
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,378
Are you leaving us?

858
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,883
No. Come on, no.
What are you talking about?

859
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,385
No, we're always gonna be together.

860
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,723
That's what Diana Ross said.

861
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:29,398
- Listen, that was a trio. We're a quartet.
- It's true.

862
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:34,195
Just missed him.
Souther just stepped out.

863
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,155
I need his signature on some things.

864
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,658
This stuff can't be processed
without him.

865
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:42,286
Well, just leave it here, Henry.
I'll make sure he signs it when he comes in.

866
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:10,606
We found her.

867
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,943
Beautiful work. What's the address?

868
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:17,905
It's Church Street at 29th
in San Francisco.

869
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,368
- Thought you were gone.
- Got all the way to the car, no keys.

870
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:25,580
Tate said to leave
the money vouchers with him.

871
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,291
He said you'd sign them later.

872
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,018
Here's our leak, boys. Plug him up!

873
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,604
Get him out of here. Let's go, Tate.

874
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,315
The pope. Tomorrow.

875
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:55,735
Oh, my gosh, I'll be so nervous.
What if I forget the words?

876
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:59,238
You're gonna go straight to hell.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

877
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,449
Come on, sisters.
Rehearsal in five minutes.

878
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,951
- Go to rehearsal. I'll be there in a minute.
- Right.

879
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:17,089
One, two, three and slide.
One, two, three and slide.

880
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:20,593
One, two, three and slide.
Sister, take over now.

881
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:24,055
One, two, three, together.
One, two, three, together.

882
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,436
- Oh, come in.
- Where's Deloris?

883
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,355
- Is something wrong?
- They know she's here.

884
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:35,066
Oh, my goodness.
She's upstairs with the choir.

885
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:42,073
- Deloris.
- Hi.

886
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,909
Look, Vince knows you're here.
We gotta get out now.

887
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,744
I can't.
We sing for the pope tomorrow.

888
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:50,539
You're gonna be singing for Saint Peter
if you don't get your ass out of here now.

889
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,541
But I...

890
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:01,634
I can't do this. I can't leave.
It's like I'm deserting them.

891
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:03,719
Hey, I think they'll understand.

892
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,138
No, you don't understand.
They need me.

893
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:10,267
They need you? A bunch of nuns?
What for? Moral guidance?

894
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:13,604
- What, makeup tips?
- Let me tell you something.

895
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,232
We are talking about the pope.
This means a great deal to them.

896
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,151
And they have worked very hard for this
and they deserve it.

897
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:20,945
Where are you going?

898
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:25,700
- Where are you going?
- I am going to the little nuns' room, nosy!

899
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,725
There you are!
We've been looking for you.

900
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,893
- Rehearsal's about to start.
- Okay. Let's go.

901
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,312
- Surprise.
- Guess who.

902
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,398
- Rehearsal's this way, sister.
- Hey, Deloris.

903
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,567
- Hi. Yeah.
- All right, all right.

904
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,788
- What? Who are they?
- Reno scum.

905
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:14,874
Come on, man!

906
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,046
Come on, come on, let's go.
All right, all right.

907
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:33,267
Where are we going?

908
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,770
Your sister here's
got a special command performance.

909
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,480
Yeah, back at the Moonlite Lounge.

910
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:40,941
Look, why don't you just let her go?
She doesn't have anything to do with this.

911
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,402
Oh, yeah, sure.
So she can run right to the cops, huh?

912
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:49,408
Look, you just go with the flow, okay?
Relax. You do what I tell you.

913
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:59,084
Go!

914
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:03,506
- She's getting away.
- You don't have to worry about her.

915
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:06,717
- You got the one you came for.
- She's right. Let's go.

916
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:11,722
- Are you all right? It's okay, I'm a cop.
- They've got Mary Clarence and guns.

917
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,891
- Where are they taking her?
- The Moonlite Lounge.

918
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,643
- Come on, get out of the street.
- Okay.

919
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:32,701
- You mean they kidnapped her?
- Yes, two men. And they had guns.

920
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,662
Why would anyone kidnap a nun?

921
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:36,288
Were they Catholics?

922
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:43,045
She isn't a nun. She's a lounge singer.
Her real name is Deloris Van Cartier.

923
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,507
She witnessed a vicious crime
and has been hiding in our convent.

924
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,009
- She isn't a nun?
- She lied to us?

925
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:51,971
- But she was such a wonderful nun.
- Look what she did with the choir.

926
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,807
- She made us sing beautifully.
- That should have tipped us.

927
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,393
Well, I don't care who she is.
We can't sing without her!

928
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,603
She's our inspiration.

929
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:03,774
Reverend Mother. Please, I know that you
and Mary Clarence didn't always agree,

930
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,151
- but we've gotta help her, please.
- We must save her.

931
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:09,738
We can't leave it up to the feds.

932
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,325
Calm down, calm down. Mary Robert.

933
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,744
Think clearly. Have you any idea
who these two men were?

934
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:20,749
Yes, they were from Reno and
they're taking her to the Moonlite Lounge.

935
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:24,003
Reno, Nevada.

936
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,630
Mary Emmanuel,
tell the monsignor the situation.

937
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,633
- Yes, mother.
- The rest of you, follow me.

938
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:34,221
It's 1 ,500 for the run to Reno.
That's 500 less than I normally charge.

939
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,473
But we don't have $1 ,500.

940
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:38,767
Well, then I can't fly you there.
I'm sorry.

941
01:21:40,353 --> 01:21:42,855
Look, I'm sorry. I've got some things
I have to check out here.

942
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:46,400
Father, do not blame this young pilot
for abandoning us in our hour of need.

943
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:50,362
When he stands before you on the day of
judgement, do not send straight him to hell.

944
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,574
Please, do not treat him with
the same disregard that he's treated us.

945
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,492
Just because he can't show
charity to nuns,

946
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:58,203
try not to leave him without rewards
when he asks for them.

947
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:00,080
We know it is easier
to answer the prayers

948
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,124
of a man who has answered
the prayers of others,

949
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,419
but if he should come to you
for relief of pain--

950
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:09,214
Such as rheumatoid arthritis,
loss of hair, neck polyps.

951
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,634
Don't leave him bald
and yowling in despair.

952
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:14,136
Watch over him
as he refuses to watch over us.

953
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:16,597
If you cannot, we know that you
will have done your best.

954
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,225
- What goes around comes around.
- Sisters, sisters.

955
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,020
Hold on a second.

956
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:45,417
What did you think you were doing
running to the cops, Deloris? Hiding out?

957
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,461
Big no-no, babe.

958
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:49,380
Bet you're sorry now.

959
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:54,009
I'm sorry for all my sins, Vince.
And I'm sorry for yours.

960
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,553
I loved you, Deloris.

961
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:58,639
I gave you everything.

962
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:02,101
My affection, my time, a big-time career.

963
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,104
And how do you repay me?
What's the thanks I get?

964
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:09,733
Where's the loyalty?
You shouldn't have done that to me, babe.

965
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,861
You'll be judged. We all will.

966
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,031
I don't get judged.

967
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:19,326
Vince, she's been acting weird
since we picked her up.

968
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,329
It's like she's scared of nothing.

969
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:26,291
She's scared.
Tell the boys how scared you are.

970
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:28,627
I forgive you, Vince.

971
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,802
Waste her.

972
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:49,064
It's beautiful!

973
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:52,109
And what a lovely name. Reno.

974
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,445
And Gomorrah!

975
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:57,072
She was this doll.
She used to wear fruit on her head and go:

976
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:01,160
- Excuse me, Vince.
- Yeah.

977
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:02,703
It's done?

978
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,413
Not totally.

979
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:10,461
- What's the problem?
- Vince, we can't waste a nun.

980
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,550
What are you nuts talking about?
It's Deloris in a costume.

981
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,136
Well, Vince, how do you know
she didn't join up

982
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,388
and become a real nun
when she was there?

983
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:22,931
Things like this happen.

984
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:31,398
Because I know this woman in the biblical
sense and she ain't no nun.

985
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:34,777
Now, I don't want to hear any more of this
Go in there and do it.

986
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,570
Just don't come back till it's over.

987
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,281
- Okay.
- It's done.

988
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:43,786
- Okay, we go one, two, three, shoot.
- Wait.

989
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:47,164
We don't go one, two,
and shoot on three?

990
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,208
Get over there.

991
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:57,549
One, two, three.

992
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:01,595
- You didn't shoot.
- Neither did you.

993
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:05,849
- I figured if you did, I wouldn't have to.
- That's what I figured.

994
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:10,437
Sisters, come on!

995
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,194
Deloris, we got it all worked out.

996
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,655
- Strip.
- What?

997
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,490
Come on, come on.
Take off the nun thing.

998
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:23,325
Yeah, yeah, the nun thing.

999
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:26,286
- What is she doing?
- Oh, my God. She's praying.

1000
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:30,457
Lord, I want you to forgive
Willy and Joey.

1001
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,877
Because they know not what they do.

1002
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,505
They're only doing
what Vince told them to do.

1003
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:39,383
Because Vince is too chicken
to do it himself.

1004
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:43,554
So he's called upon these two men
to take care of his business.

1005
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:46,306
So I want you to forgive them, Lord.

1006
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,442
- Amen.
- Amen.

1007
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,793
You all right? You all right?

1008
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,939
- Go find Vince.
- Right.

1009
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:42,779
Wait, wait, wait! Oh, my goodness.
There it is. The Moonlite Lounge.

1010
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:10,307
Brace yourself, sisters.
Spread out and look for Mary Clarence.

1011
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,310
Try to blend in.

1012
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:21,902
Hi. Excuse me. Sorry.

1013
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,113
Has anyone seen a nun?
A Carmelite nun? No? Sure?

1014
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:28,116
No, she's not really a nun.
She's just posing as a nun.

1015
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,743
It was a great shock to us--

1016
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,337
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1017
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:41,672
Place your bets.

1018
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,674
Red 23.

1019
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:46,301
Are you sure? How do you know?

1020
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,805
- Red 23.
- Me too.

1021
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:52,224
- Works for me.
- I'm on it.

1022
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,062
Red 14.

1023
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:00,899
I was just trying
to teach you all a lesson.

1024
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,987
Oh, excuse me!

1025
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,830
Sister Mary Ignatius!

1026
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:16,873
Follow me.

1027
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:27,843
Block off the street.

1028
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:30,429
- But don't move in until I tell you.
- Okay.

1029
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,189
- What are you doing here?
- We're saving you.

1030
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,901
Mary Clarence, you're safe.

1031
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:47,362
Come on, move, move.

1032
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:50,324
Break! Now!

1033
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,828
- Joey.
- Vinny. There's a thousand nuns here.

1034
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,581
- What do we do?
- You go to the left. You go to the right.

1035
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,333
- I'll go down the middle.
- All right.

1036
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,963
Place your bets. Place your bets.

1037
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:23,565
Hey, babe.

1038
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,277
Yes, sweetheart?

1039
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:36,578
Seal off the exits
and get ready to move in.

1040
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:42,501
There's another way out.
Let's go. Come. Excuse us.

1041
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:03,855
Move in now.

1042
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,694
- I can't see a thing.
- Willy, hit the lights!

1043
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:15,325
Freeze!

1044
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,202
Everybody!

1045
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,247
Joey.

1046
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,832
Where is she?

1047
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,919
I'm right here. I'm here.

1048
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,464
Leave them alone.
They don't have anything to do with it.

1049
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:31,258
I'm here.

1050
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,513
Calm down.

1051
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,442
Joey, do it.

1052
01:30:48,651 --> 01:30:52,737
I can't, Vince. She's still a nun.

1053
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:57,451
She's a broad, you got it? Just a broad.

1054
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,661
I guarantee you she is no broad.

1055
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:02,205
She is Sister Mary Clarence
of Saint Katherine's Convent.

1056
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:05,375
She's a model of generosity,
virtue and love.

1057
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:08,170
You have my word for it, gentlemen.
She is a nun.

1058
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:13,758
You hear that?
Now, aren't you glad we didn't shoot her?

1059
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:20,557
- Don't shoot!
- Drop it.

1060
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:21,933
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1061
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:25,103
Guns down. Drop it, okay?

1062
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,731
You all right? You okay?

1063
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:29,483
Oh, God.

1064
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,280
I'm shot! Watch the arm!

1065
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,659
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
Things got kind of out of hand.

1066
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,161
Oh, just kind of out of hand?

1067
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,623
Boy, am I glad you're a much better shot
than you are a protector.

1068
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:46,917
But...

1069
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:49,377
Thank you.

1070
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,922
- All right, come on.
- I was good to you.

1071
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:55,592
We had a great thing!
You sang in a hotel! Badly!

1072
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:57,802
How could you betray me like this?!

1073
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:01,306
- You are nothing!
- Get him out of here.

1074
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:04,684
- I got two words for you, Vince.
- Mary Clarence.

1075
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,647
Bless you.

1076
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:10,357
Let's go.

1077
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,775
- Come on.
- Hey!

1078
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:15,529
I hold you responsible for all of this.

1079
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,906
For introducing a lounge act
into my convent.

1080
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:23,203
For utterly disrupting our lives
and exposing us to mortal danger.

1081
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:25,956
Thank you.

1082
01:32:30,127 --> 01:32:33,630
No, no, thank you. Thank you all.

1083
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:36,758
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

1084
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:40,387
We thought you were a nun, Deloris.

1085
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:42,931
Van Cartier.

1086
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,605
Sisters, we have a concert to do.

1087
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:55,485
- I thought you were leaving.
- We can't both of us leave.
