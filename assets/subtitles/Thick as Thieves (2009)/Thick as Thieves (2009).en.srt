1
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:19,507
All right.

2
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:21,786
I know, I know, I know.

3
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:25,425
A gun...
It's dangerous for no one except you.

4
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:28,105
You know what I want, don't you?

5
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:30,100
Yes.

6
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:33,144
You're wasting time.
Don't fuck with me!

7
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:36,220
Open it. Open it!

8
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:52,009
Open it!

9
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,093
Give me what I want.

10
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:01,939
I don't understand,
I don't have anything else.

11
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,300
If the man's offering you
all that money, I'd take it.

12
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,577
When I need financial advice,
I'll call my broker.

13
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,577
- I'm just saying, is all.
- Whatever.

14
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,016
Take off your coat.
Take off your coat!

15
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:26,855
- Now, how hard was that?
- Excuse me.

16
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:29,930
Mister, I thought I told...

17
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:34,963
What the?...

18
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:42,322
Go, go! Move! Everybody down!

19
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,211
Move! Move!

20
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:48,242
Move!

21
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,559
Go, go, go!

22
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,807
Suspect white or Hispanic male.
Wearing a reflective vest.

23
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,918
He's on top of the cars.
All units at Vernon Jackson.

24
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:17,283
Everybody down! Stay down!

25
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,560
Other end!

26
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:37,079
Everybody down!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

27
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:18,435
Move, move! Everybody down!
Face down on the platform!

28
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,713
Come on, face down!
Everybody off the train!

29
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,514
Come on, face down!
Get down!

30
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,913
- Officer...
- Move!

31
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:29,872
Come on, guys, get down!

32
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:32,231
Get your ass down!
Get down!

33
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:35,151
Get down! Search the tracks!

34
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:39,262
He went down the tunnel?
Check the tunnel, check the roof.

35
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,269
Come on, people!
Face down on the ground now!

36
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:50,069
He jumped!
He was on the roof!

37
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,468
This train is closed.
Nobody gets on.

38
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,627
Sir, I need you to calm down.

39
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,340
Get these people moving.

40
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:09,338
Stop right there.

41
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:13,264
The punk's got balls...

42
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,464
but no positive identification.

43
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:19,177
No... huh, there's another
camera pointing at the platform.

44
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:26,423
Michaels, stop it right there.

45
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,062
You see what I see?

46
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:31,542
- Maybe.
- That's him, Lieutenant.

47
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:32,621
That's who?

48
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,040
How long have you been
a detective, Micheals?

49
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,540
11 months, sir.

50
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,341
I'm 22 years in robbery
and homicide.

51
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:40,500
One of your subcategories
of robbery is art theft.

52
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,779
There's a lot of that in the Apple.
Are you aware of that, Michaels?

53
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,379
- I guess so, yeah.
- I wasn't.

54
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:48,058
When I was your age, I was happy
with regular murder and mayhem.

55
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,658
Lieutenant Weber minored
in art history at Fordham.

56
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:51,697
Oh.

57
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,498
Anyway, the Chief starts
calling me Lieutenant Picasso...

58
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:57,177
and puts me in charge
every time there is the theft...

59
00:08:57,177 --> 00:08:58,657
of as much as an Etch-A-Sketch.

60
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:02,535
Two decades,
I've been putting 'em all away.

61
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,216
Everybody but him, Keith Ripley.

62
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:09,167
He's the best there is.
Howdy, Keith.

63
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,085
You've been bad boy.

64
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,328
- Perhaps I could give you 15.
- No.

65
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,969
That is not possible.

66
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,648
I wouldn't take less than 100.

67
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:51,326
I'm just saying, is all.

68
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:54,357
- You...
- Mind if I borrow this?

69
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,885
- Well, I may have wanted to use it.
- Mm.

70
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:00,200
But yours will do.

71
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,005
Will you please put down my gun?

72
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:04,884
There's one thing
you should be aware of, Gabriel,

73
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:07,245
or do you prefer Seńor Martin?

74
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:09,884
The police cannot arrest you
for armed robbery,

75
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:11,323
if your gun isn't loaded.

76
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:12,524
Your point?

77
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,163
You think I'd walk around
with a loaded shotgun?

78
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,794
Let's see.

79
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,802
- You could have checked.
- Why?

80
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:24,201
You have my diamonds,
my score, my money.

81
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:27,596
Enjoy.
Nice meeting you both. Bye.

82
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:31,995
By the way,
I was going to ask for 125.

83
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm just saying, is all.

84
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,038
- Gabriel, stay.
- Why?

85
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,513
What else do you want?
You gonna shoot me now?

86
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,197
Well, in as much as
you did steal the diamonds,

87
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,597
I figure it's only fair
to share the proceeds with you.

88
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,912
So to what do I owe
this act of generosity?

89
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:54,394
I have a proposition
I wish to discuss with you.

90
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,034
So...

91
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:01,115
how did you know
I would come here,

92
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:02,514
as well as my name?

93
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:04,153
It's part of the proposition...

94
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,832
Oh, shit!

95
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,866
- Come on:
- All right, take it easy, take it easy.

96
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,065
Nicky would like his money.

97
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,543
- Ask him.
- Thank you.

98
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,711
This is between you and them.
Got nothing to do with me.

99
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:26,547
Everything does now.

100
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,070
Call this interest.
Nicky is tired of waiting for you.

101
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,787
You must have very bad karma.

102
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:46,667
I actually don't believe in it.
Still, about this propos...

103
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:50,426
No, no, no, no!
You're totally out of your mind.

104
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,784
Good night.

105
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,745
- Hey.
- What?

106
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,422
Here's your karma.

107
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:07,062
- What was in the other envelope?
- Your cut.

108
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:11,297
Now you've got mine.

109
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:13,822
Whatever.

110
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:17,216
- Think about it.
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

111
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:44,250
Hmm.

112
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,125
Now... what do you want?

113
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,288
A partner.

114
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:56,405
What'd you think
I was doing on that train?

115
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:59,134
- I was watching you work.
- Hm.

116
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:02,493
I've been your shadow
ever since you got to town.

117
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:06,967
So why were you in my town
robbing subways?

118
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:10,491
It's hurricane season in Miami.
I don't like hurricanes.

119
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:14,090
Or you didn't feel like
going back to Angola.

120
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,850
It's over.
Lesson learned.

121
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:18,210
Look...

122
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,049
Gabriel Martin is a rock star.

123
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:24,168
So why were you holding
open-mike night on the subway...

124
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:26,562
for a lousy 100 grand?

125
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:28,349
Two reasons...

126
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,888
Yes, Miami was getting too hot.

127
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,998
And perhaps you can relate to this.

128
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:36,076
Sometimes...

129
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,998
Sometimes you just need
to feel the rush.

130
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,765
The juice.

131
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,286
Yeah.

132
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,519
You know what I mean.

133
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:50,004
Yesterday,
you took down two jewelers...

134
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,796
for a few stones from Romanov's.

135
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:55,724
My idea is Romanov's itself.

136
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:58,003
Please...

137
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:03,081
Specifically, two Fabergé eggs
worth 20 million dollars...

138
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,921
Each.

139
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:09,840
It's a two-man job.

140
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,513
Do I have your attention?

141
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:35,866
Wait here.

142
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:40,707
I hear they prefer cash...
or your first-born.

143
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,547
Why don't you try
The Standard instead?

144
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,990
Jealous?

145
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,019
Of who?

146
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,469
The mystery bandit.

147
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,703
I'm afraid that type of thing
is not my style.

148
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,908
Well, I think this guy's
got panache... guts.

149
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,706
And a passing resemblance,
at least in body type.

150
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:33,586
Well, you don't have
to rob trains to have panache.

151
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:38,697
Or guts... but you've gotta admit that
kind of thing immediately brands you.

152
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,183
My treat... too painful watching
you attempt to read Cyrillic.

153
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:49,182
Oh, no, no, no... I was just... huh,
looking at the picture.

154
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,258
So you are jealous.

155
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:56,054
Yes... you got me there.
Absolutely.

156
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:01,100
I've gotta get this...
Chinese food to my boss...

157
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:03,100
so, um...

158
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:05,100
some other time.

159
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,899
- When, some other time?
- I'll call you.

160
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,938
But you don't have my number
or know my name or anything.

161
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,339
I guess that could be a problem.

162
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,208
Gabriel.

163
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,738
- Oh, shit!
- Are you with him?

164
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:18,857
I don't know.
Should I? More or less.

165
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:21,217
Ahh... yes, I am.

166
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:23,451
What'd you want?

167
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:26,096
Can't I bring my goddaughter
a birthday present?

168
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,536
My birthday was last month.

169
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,056
It was two weeks ago
and I'm sorry it's late.

170
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:34,370
Alex, it's just a present.
No strings.

171
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,845
No thanks.

172
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,171
Well, it was nice
to have almost met you, Gabriel.

173
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:43,653
- Gaby.
- Gaby.

174
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:47,014
It's a shame you don't keep
a higher class of company.

175
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:56,250
- Don't even think about it.
- Think about what?

176
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:59,250
You go anywhere near her.
I'll rip your heart out. I mean it.

177
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,282
It looks like it's your heart,
she's not so fond of.

178
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,163
You were warned.
Let's go.

179
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,409
I thought you said
the target was Romanov's.

180
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,328
- This is research.
- Research?

181
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,607
Oh, wow!

182
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:20,759
They're absolutely stunning.

183
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,526
They are.

184
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,326
Between 1885 and 1916...

185
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:30,525
Fabergé produced 50 of these
Easter eggs for the Empress...

186
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:33,045
and her daughter-in-law,
the Czarina Alexandra.

187
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:34,923
Should I take notes?

188
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:36,804
Will there be a quiz?

189
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,962
No quiz but there will be a test.

190
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:45,402
Okay... the Fabergés are all made
of precious metals and fine jewels.

191
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:49,082
- Every one a unique masterpiece.
- Indeed.

192
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,361
Most are on display in the Kremlin.

193
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,080
The rest in private collections,
museums... or lost.

194
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:58,269
In this case, at Romanov's.

195
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,519
Who is your buyer?

196
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,159
You don't want to know.

197
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,358
Oh, I'm stealing 40 million dollars
worth of eggs so I want to know.

198
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,837
I also want to know
why these particular eggs...

199
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,230
are even worth 40 million dollars.

200
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,031
Because no one knows they exist.

201
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:15,396
Oh.

202
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:18,356
- The so-called mystery eggs?
- Mm-hm.

203
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:22,316
Yeah, I've heard rumors,
but I thought it was just a myth.

204
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:26,835
Last year, they turned up...
at Romanov's.

205
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,634
So how do you know this?

206
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:33,273
I was partners with a man named
Victor Korolenko... Alex's father.

207
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,074
He was in tight with the Russians.

208
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,792
What they knew, he knew.

209
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:40,472
So, why aren't you
pulling this job with him?

210
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:43,192
Let's just say
he's no longer around.

211
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:46,143
Leave it at that.

212
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:50,911
He's gone.

213
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,190
You're here.

214
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,383
Now we just have to deliver.

215
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,628
- Ripley...
- Hmm?

216
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,419
Why?

217
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,387
Why risk your freedom at all?

218
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,708
This will not be
anything close to easy.

219
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,666
You are not in jail in the present.

220
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:13,778
- Are you not comfortable?
- I'm never comfortable.

221
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:17,579
Some people
were born to compose music.

222
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,657
Others to split the atom.

223
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:25,695
I was born to steal shit.

224
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:29,623
Hold out your hand.

225
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,173
Hand?

226
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,142
That coin was given to me by Victor
when we became partners.

227
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,621
The coin represents
a Russian phrase.

228
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:48,540
"Vorovoslky mir".
Loosely translated, thieves' world.

229
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,180
Victor belonged to it.

230
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,209
Now...

231
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,096
you belong to it.

232
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,652
Psst... Hey!

233
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:37,291
You misunderstand.
Ripley's just... huh, business.

234
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:39,131
This is... huh...

235
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,330
Stalking?

236
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:46,080
Well... if you had given me
your number, I would have called first.

237
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:49,528
Those are two
very flawed assumptions.

238
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,128
Do you have a vase?

239
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,048
I just took these
from a roadside shrine...

240
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,268
and I think they need some, huh...
water.

241
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:57,728
Huh...

242
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:02,362
- May I use that... huh, thing over there?
- Sure...

243
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:08,066
I... I've noticed this... huh,
Russian nightclub, down the block, huh...

244
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,086
Riga Rose
or something like that.

245
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,922
Why don't we meet there
after work?

246
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,673
I'm busy.

247
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:23,083
- I'll wait.
- I won't show.

248
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:25,681
I'll take my chances.

249
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:31,882
Do svidanja, Alexandra.

250
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:36,161
Research. Keith Ripley.
'93, the Brooklyn Museum.

251
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,000
'94, the Diamond District Warehouse
and then in '95...

252
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:42,319
I'm very familiar
with Ripley's life story, Michaels.

253
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,598
In fact, I busted him twice.

254
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,078
Both times he walked
because of good lawyering.

255
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,958
Exactly, so I thought
why not swing for the fences?

256
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,837
Murder one, Victor Korolenko.

257
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:55,677
Thinkin ' of the Brighton Beach steam bath?
Forget it. There was no...

258
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,557
- No body. But we've got a ton of forensics.
- And no witnesses.

259
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:01,517
Nobody there admitted
to seeing a thing.

260
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:04,915
I was this close to convincing
Korolenko to take witness protection,

261
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,155
in exchange for giving up Ripley.

262
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:09,674
But Ripley got to him first.

263
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:11,275
I can't prove it.

264
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:13,473
Right, okay. I see, I see... okay.

265
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:16,394
No...
what you don't see, Michaels,

266
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:19,272
is why Ripley got involved
in a small-time caper,

267
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:22,432
like grabbin ' a few diamonds
off of some couriers on a subway.

268
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:23,512
And neither did I.

269
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:26,587
Until I read
the Dutch guy's statement.

270
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:30,502
Those diamonds
came from Romanov's.

271
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:35,426
You mean Ripley and his new partner
are planning to take down Romanov's?

272
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,289
Ah... come on.
Like that could ever happen.

273
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,988
Not even Ripley
could take down a place like that.

274
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,179
Wanna bet?

275
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:12,104
- Hi.
- Hi.

276
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:15,502
- You know this place very well.
- I never said I didn't.

277
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:17,702
Let's face it,
you didn't see the nightclub.

278
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:21,342
You saw the flyer in the fax
and then you made an assumption.

279
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:24,461
Yeah. Guilty. So I did.

280
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:28,381
Never assume anything,
especially down here.

281
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,901
- How mysterious.
- What?

282
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:33,539
How mysterious.

283
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,779
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I don't drink.

284
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,695
Another assumption.

285
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,417
You wanna dance?

286
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:46,538
Yeah.

287
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:50,647
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.
Why not?

288
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,964
Here.

289
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,566
- And for him.
- Thank you.

290
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:50,806
Thanks.

291
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,486
I thought all Russians drank.

292
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:55,684
Translation,
we're a race of suicidal alcoholics.

293
00:24:55,685 --> 00:24:58,045
No... I didn't mean that. No.

294
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:01,200
Actually, we are.
Cheers.

295
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:03,564
- Nastravila?
- Nastravise

296
00:25:03,565 --> 00:25:05,284
Nastravise?
Mm'mm

297
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:11,083
So... how is it...
working for the lawyer?

298
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:14,902
- Huh... I'm a lawyer, too, you know.
- Oh.

299
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:18,601
Maybe I won't say another word,
because everything I say is wrong.

300
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,560
- Well, you don't know until you try.
- True.

301
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,559
Besides, my father warned me
about being a lawyer.

302
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,680
He told me I should try and do
something honest with my life.

303
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:29,999
As if he would know.

304
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,711
Your father and Ripley,
they were close, right?

305
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:39,277
Once upon a time.

306
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:44,666
I'm sure Ripley told you.
My father's dead.

307
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,836
Now Ripley likes
to try to take care of me.

308
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:51,830
Pay for stuff. That kind of thing.

309
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:55,474
Of course, it's the least he can do.

310
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:59,153
Sorry. I don't mean to pry.

311
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,553
Yes, you do.

312
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:11,229
Now who is making assumptions?

313
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:16,227
No, Gaby. I'm not assuming a thing.

314
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:33,626
You wanna know about Ripley?

315
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,580
Stay away.

316
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:17,419
You son of a bitch!

317
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,858
Well... you dropped these...

318
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:24,898
and I am a gentleman
bringing them back to you.

319
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,529
Uh-huh.

320
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,410
No, no, no, no, no!

321
00:27:34,938 --> 00:27:37,010
No!

322
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:27,843
Shit, man! What do you want?

323
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:31,085
I told you to leave her alone.

324
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:34,086
I'm not gonna tell you again.

325
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:37,878
Get dressed. I'll be downstairs.

326
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:46,877
Son of a bitch.

327
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:52,711
Fascinating.

328
00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:57,395
You could start a whole new trend
in interior design.

329
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:02,320
- What are these?
- What do they look like?

330
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,361
Police IDs?

331
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:08,631
There's a reception at Romanov's
tonight, honoring the NYPD.

332
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:11,919
And our invitation's just arrived.

333
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,239
A cop for the night.

334
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,838
And all the doughnuts you can eat.

335
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,758
Meanwhile, however,
I need you to go to the dry-cleaners.

336
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,238
Why don't you go and pick up
your dry-cleaning yourself, sir?

337
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,914
Who said anything about picking up?

338
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:27,912
You're dropping off.

339
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,509
Cellphone, please.

340
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:38,104
- Commissioner Rawls.
- Gentlemen.

341
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:40,064
Deputy Commissioner Morelli.

342
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:41,942
Such a pleasure having you here.

343
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:44,462
May we give you gentlemen
the grand tour?

344
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:46,662
- The secrets of Romanov?
- You might say so.

345
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:49,294
- Thank you. We're honored.
- Please.

346
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,661
The guards,
all FSB secret police.

347
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:59,940
Every door, every inch of glass
wired and alarmed.

348
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:04,528
So even if a bird flies in here,
you know about it.

349
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:06,219
Topkapi.

350
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,659
Rififi.

351
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,498
No, the bird flew into the museum,
landed on the wire...

352
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,897
and set off the alarm in Topkapi.

353
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:15,376
You're a cineaste.

354
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:18,645
Actually, I only see heist movies.

355
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,855
Well, the lesson to take away from
the bird flying into the museum...

356
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:27,414
is no matter how well you planned,
always be ready to improvise...

357
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:30,414
because, I guarantee you,
something's gonna go wrong.

358
00:31:30,415 --> 00:31:33,094
- I'd prefer to avoid that.
- Uh-huh.

359
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:36,573
How comprehensive
is the surveillance system?

360
00:31:36,574 --> 00:31:38,692
Let's take a look.

361
00:31:58,411 --> 00:32:00,888
- Smart card for the elevator.
- And all the doors.

362
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,009
This way. After you.

363
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:04,798
We're on.

364
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:10,163
Good to see you, old friend.
Let me introduce you.

365
00:32:10,688 --> 00:32:14,719
Lieutenant Weber, I presume.

366
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,365
You know, Ripley,
identity theft is a serious crime.

367
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:21,204
- And quite an embarrassing one in this case.
- Really?

368
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,964
Do you realize
how ashamed I felt...

369
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:26,444
telling that nice lady at the door
that I was still a lieutenant?

370
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,403
I mean at my age?

371
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,084
Or should I say at your age?

372
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:33,242
I'm not amused.
What are you doing here?

373
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:36,603
And why did you appropriate
my invitation? As if I didn't know.

374
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:38,721
I apologize for the subterfuge.

375
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:42,481
I just wanted to show my friend here
some of the finer things in life.

376
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:46,441
If you want to arrest us for impersonating
police officers, go right ahead.

377
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm sure my lawyer
will have us out in two hours.

378
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,000
It'd be a delightful two hours.
Get your hands down.

379
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,479
Then there's all that explaining
you'd have to do to your superiors.

380
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,439
Now that would be
an embarrassment.

381
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,198
Notorious thief gaining admittance
pretending to be you.

382
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,557
Great police work, Weber.

383
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:06,277
We should discuss my police work
when this is all over.

384
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,676
Hmm.

385
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:11,156
- Who's your sidekick?
- Jules Dassin.

386
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:15,556
Good to meet you, Jules.
I love your movies.

387
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:17,515
Enjoy the party, gents.

388
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:20,307
While it lasts.

389
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:26,034
Now... do you mind telling me
what that was all about?

390
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:30,190
- Just a cop.
- Really? No kidding.

391
00:33:30,953 --> 00:33:34,592
We have been made in the very place
we are supposed to take down.

392
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:36,991
Exactly how do you stay out of jail?

393
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:42,786
Unless, of course, you and this Weber
are partners trying to set me up.

394
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,782
Are you, Ripley?

395
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,029
Here we go.

396
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,468
Come on. Move your damn ass!

397
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,307
Weber has no idea
what we're here for.

398
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:58,788
Of course he does.

399
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,907
He doesn't know when
and he doesn't know how.

400
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:02,747
And, no, he doesn't know
about the eggs.

401
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:04,386
No one does. Here.

402
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:05,946
The best way to neutralize Weber...

403
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:09,106
is to fuel his obsession
with busting me.

404
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:12,864
He's so blinded by it, he no longer
thinks like a cop. Trust me.

405
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:15,144
Give me a good reason to, huh?

406
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:18,822
I already gave you 40 million
good reasons. Here.

407
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:22,623
Now you've seen what the public sees,
it's time for the real treat.

408
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:26,382
That is, of course, as long as you
promise not to come back and rob us.

409
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:28,342
I guess I won't take any notes, then.

410
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,581
Our main vault.

411
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,701
Gregor disarm
the motion detectors...

412
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:38,141
Even with the knowledge
of all protocols,

413
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:40,579
it is absolutely impregnable.

414
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,619
The voice sensors ask
our head of security, Boris Sergev,

415
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:45,699
a random set of pre-recorded words.

416
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:48,659
But this is only half the process.

417
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,777
We also have
a biometric handprint sensor.

418
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:56,137
Since Mr. Sergev and I are
the only ones who have clearance,

419
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,416
we must both be present
to open the vaults.

420
00:34:58,418 --> 00:35:01,456
Once I activate
the biometric handprint sensor,

421
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,775
he must activate the voice sensor.

422
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:06,615
This way neither of us
can steal from the other.

423
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:09,175
Well, you better hope Mr. Sergev
stays healthy.

424
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:13,215
I must stay
healthy as well!

425
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:25,561
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

426
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:29,527
- Big Apple.
- Big Apple.

427
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:37,369
Jesus Christ.

428
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:40,809
The vault door
automatically resets on the hour...

429
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:43,889
at which point the sensor
must be activated in reverse...

430
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:47,648
All In all gentlemen
best not to get locked inside

431
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:50,047
Well, did I say it was gonna be easy?

432
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:53,686
No, but you didn't say
it would be impossible either.

433
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,327
Armored glass...

434
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:59,039
It would take half an hour
to break through just one case.

435
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:03,286
But, I'm afraid, whoever tried
wouldn't even have half a second...

436
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,724
because an ultrasonic motion detector
would automatically lock him in...

437
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:08,605
and trigger the alarm.

438
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:12,083
Containment security gentlemen
Getting in is highly improbable...

439
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:14,403
But getting out
is frankly impossible.

440
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,202
Where does that door lead to?

441
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:19,563
To our inner vault which
contains our most precious items...

442
00:36:19,563 --> 00:36:21,561
I'm sorry but security prevents me...

443
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:24,121
from taking even this
distinguished group in there.

444
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:26,461
Now we'll proceed back to
the reception, but before we do...

445
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:28,561
I'd like to, once again,
thank you both...

446
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,681
for your generosity this last year
in helping set up our business.

447
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,960
And thank you very much
for the donation of that chopper.

448
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,320
You're quite welcome.

449
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,599
- Let's go.
- We can do this, Gabriel.

450
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,469
No... Absolutely not.

451
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,030
- It was a pleasure. Goodbye.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

452
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,438
We're not going any where yet.

453
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:51,117
If Zykov finds that camera,
he's gonna know what it is.

454
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:53,277
They'll change all the protocols.

455
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:57,864
Which part of "I don't give a shit"
do you not understand?

456
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:17,391
Sorry. Let me just...

457
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:19,391
- I'll handle it.
- No, no, no.

458
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:22,391
- Please, please. Allow me.
- I'm absolutely okay.

459
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:24,590
I apologize, sir.

460
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:03,454
What the fuck?

461
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:05,023
What the fuck?

462
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:08,382
Detective Weber, I'm Hal Donley,
special agent in charge of this op.

463
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,222
You're conducting an investigation
of a potential theft...

464
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:13,702
that you assume is going down
at Romanov Jewelers.

465
00:38:13,702 --> 00:38:15,661
Assume, my ass.

466
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:18,621
I know it's going down
and I know who's pulling it off.

467
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:21,260
Except we're asking you
to call off your dogs.

468
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:23,340
There are other matters
that take precedence.

469
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,099
What could possibly
take precedence...

470
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:27,739
over the potential theft
of millions of dollars in diamonds...

471
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,532
from a company that donates tons
of money and equipment to the NYPD?

472
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,297
Valentin?

473
00:38:35,298 --> 00:38:37,057
Vitaly Zykov, in the old Soviet days,

474
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:41,487
was the right-hand man
to a party boss named Dimitri Kuzin.

475
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:46,655
Kuzin set up a supposedly independent
Russian diamond centre in America.

476
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:49,045
Romanov's...

477
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:53,494
But diamonds... they're not all
that he's shipping over here.

478
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,574
He's ripping off
the Russian Treasury, Detective.

479
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:58,445
Gold, gems, artworks.

480
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:00,574
Gentlemen, where do you think
Romanov's got the money...

481
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:04,172
to buy your department a helicopter
and now police cars?

482
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:05,932
From retail diamond sales?

483
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:09,769
- So why are they doing this?
- Is that a serious question?

484
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:13,052
So the NYPD will leave them alone.

485
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:16,161
That's their mindset.

486
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:20,489
We need more time
to build our mutual cases.

487
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,969
That's why we can't have
any other investigations...

488
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:25,840
potentially alerting Zykov.

489
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:32,007
Lieutenant...

490
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:34,277
shut it down.

491
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:39,242
- Gentlemen.
- Commissioner...

492
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:43,525
Just in case
you think you're smarter than us,

493
00:39:43,527 --> 00:39:46,606
decide to continue this investigation
on a down and low,

494
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:47,804
forget it.

495
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:52,315
This is bigger than you and your ego.
Do you get it?

496
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,043
I get it.

497
00:39:57,485 --> 00:40:02,038
- What did the feds have to say?
- Nothing. Everything's still a go.

498
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:06,762
The first order of business
is to bypass the security cameras.

499
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:09,561
If we can gain access
into the surveillance system,

500
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:13,840
we can replace the light feed with
a continuous loop of study shots...

501
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:15,880
with no face inside.

502
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,840
That still leaves the voice sensors,

503
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,760
the fingerprints,
the motion detectors,

504
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,677
the meanest-looking vault door
I have ever seen in my life.

505
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:48,275
The inner vault door,
Swiss-made, 3 feet thick,

506
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:50,793
with spring-driven relocking bolts.

507
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:53,034
If you punch out the lock,
they block retraction...

508
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,753
so that you couldn't open it
even if you knew the combination.

509
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,273
Abraham Lincoln.

510
00:40:58,273 --> 00:41:01,032
- Broadway.
- Broadway.

511
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:04,271
30 pre-recorded words.
One week, we've got them all.

512
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:05,510
Dan McWilliams, MTA.

513
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,150
Yes, we're going to be doing
some maintenance work...

514
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:10,751
in the subway adjacent
to your basement next week.

515
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:15,338
We'll be working nights and didn't
want the drilling to alarm you.

516
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:37,266
You place
an ultrasonic transducer here,

517
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:40,864
broadcasting at the exact operating
frequency of the transmitter...

518
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,744
and it bounces back
the frequency to the unit.

519
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:45,503
At least in theory.

520
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:48,224
Have you ever used
an ultrasonic transducer?

521
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:49,503
Nope.

522
00:41:49,505 --> 00:41:51,983
Can you get an ultrasonic transducer?

523
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:53,583
I can get anything, my friend.

524
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:57,782
- Can you get past a keypad?
- It is, as always, a question of time.

525
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,581
One tumbler at a time.

526
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:04,295
It is tight... but possible.

527
00:42:19,978 --> 00:42:21,813
You.

528
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:23,976
Yeah.

529
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,005
Me.

530
00:42:33,657 --> 00:42:36,047
What's so funny?

531
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:38,695
I hate Chinese food.

532
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:42,213
I absolutely, unequivocally,

533
00:42:42,215 --> 00:42:44,253
irrevocably,

534
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:47,773
loathe Chinese food.

535
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,813
Oh...

536
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:52,771
Leonid, my boss,
is addicted to Chinese food.

537
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,012
I can't even stand the smell.

538
00:42:56,012 --> 00:42:59,090
Another completely
wrong assumption.

539
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:01,244
No.

540
00:43:01,572 --> 00:43:03,650
It's not completely...

541
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,485
wrong.

542
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,998
What?

543
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,836
Wow.

544
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,606
- You stole this.
- Yes, I did.

545
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,443
- Didn't you?
- Yes. That's what I do.

546
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:16,911
Wait.

547
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:50,302
We have a problem.

548
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:53,264
The bracelet?

549
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,070
I cannot return it.

550
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,378
No, I like it.

551
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:03,429
So what could possibly be a problem?

552
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:06,663
You.

553
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:08,387
- What?
- Me.

554
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:11,027
I thought that part
was not a problem.

555
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:13,907
And Ripley.

556
00:45:13,907 --> 00:45:16,141
That part is a problem.

557
00:45:16,387 --> 00:45:20,496
Yours and Ripley's
is a world I just can't trust.

558
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:26,063
How did your father die?

559
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:29,344
By gunshot.

560
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:31,423
Who did it?

561
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:36,501
He had gambling debts to a Russian
gangster named Nicky Petrovich.

562
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:40,293
- Nicky wants his money.
- Ask him.

563
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:43,342
This concept
of... huh, vorovosky...

564
00:45:43,342 --> 00:45:46,061
"Vorovosky mir",
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

565
00:45:46,061 --> 00:45:49,541
Where... where one is responsible
for the debts of another one.

566
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:53,697
Hey, why would they kill
your father and let Ripley live?

567
00:45:54,141 --> 00:45:57,898
Because Ripley has... I don't know...
how'd you want me to put this?

568
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,735
Earning power.

569
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:04,413
Gaby...

570
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:08,092
I don't wanna go
to any more funerals.

571
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:15,576
I wanna be with you
but I can't promise you that,

572
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:20,369
and you can't promise me
a thing, so...

573
00:46:21,295 --> 00:46:24,005
maybe we shouldn't even try.

574
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:34,371
Oh, you, you, you, you.

575
00:46:37,132 --> 00:46:39,206
Get in.

576
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,648
I know you don't want to, I know you
don't mean to, but you will hurt her.

577
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,246
She doesn't need any more of that.

578
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:59,681
None of which you had
anything to do with. Am I right?

579
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:02,963
Is there something
you want to ask me?

580
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:06,126
Yes.

581
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:10,442
Why is Victor dead
and you're still walking round?

582
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:16,284
I'm sure Alex told you that Victor was
in deep to a man named Nicky Petrovich.

583
00:47:16,286 --> 00:47:19,085
What she didn't know, that Nicky
was ready to forgive the dept,

584
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:21,884
if Victor pulled a job, this job.

585
00:47:21,885 --> 00:47:24,204
- Victor backed out?
- He was trying to protect Alex.

586
00:47:24,204 --> 00:47:28,242
Made a deal with Weber.
He was gonna drop the dime on Nicky.

587
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:30,481
- And you.
- And me.

588
00:47:30,483 --> 00:47:32,961
Weber offered Victor
witness protection.

589
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:35,041
He and Alex,
but Alex didn't want to go.

590
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:38,201
Victor didn't wanna go
without her, so...

591
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:40,081
he bought a bullet instead.

592
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:44,079
So why is this still your problem?
Why don't you just... leave?

593
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:48,438
You don't make a deal with Nicky
for the throw of it and then walk away.

594
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,318
There's no statute of limitations.
Nicky wants those eggs.

595
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,996
Victor's share
would have paid off his debt.

596
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,277
Victor and I were partners.
He was responsible for me.

597
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:03,547
So now I'm responsible
for him and his debt.

598
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:04,916
Bullshit.

599
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,996
Victor is dead. Just walk away.

600
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:11,594
- That's not an option.
- Oh, wow! This is just...

601
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:14,474
Look...

602
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:16,590
We do the job.

603
00:48:16,675 --> 00:48:19,514
Nicky gets his cut,
I take a small chunk,

604
00:48:19,514 --> 00:48:22,592
nowhere near commensurate
with my risk,

605
00:48:22,594 --> 00:48:24,313
and you clear a cool 20 million.

606
00:48:24,313 --> 00:48:27,112
I don't know. This is just...

607
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,391
Look, either we pull
this job off flawlessly...

608
00:48:30,393 --> 00:48:33,431
or you call Weber
and you ask for witness protection,

609
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:34,990
which isn't a choice at all...

610
00:48:34,992 --> 00:48:37,309
because Nicky will find you
and he will kill you.

611
00:48:37,311 --> 00:48:40,943
It doesn't matter where you go
or how long it takes.

612
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,382
That's an unalterable fact.

613
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:53,702
Well...

614
00:48:57,507 --> 00:49:01,423
Then we steal the fucking eggs, no?

615
00:49:01,867 --> 00:49:03,702
Yes.

616
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,778
Oh, shit.

617
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:14,143
All right, we are working on it.
So back off, please. Thank you.

618
00:49:14,144 --> 00:49:17,139
I think he called us a name.

619
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:21,340
We do not like to be insulted.

620
00:49:22,663 --> 00:49:24,657
All right.

621
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:42,844
Do you know
the significance of this coin?

622
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:46,202
Yeah.

623
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:51,686
Then you must know by the mere fact
that you have it in your possession,

624
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:56,365
I cannot assume the two of you
will not attempt to double-cross me.

625
00:50:56,367 --> 00:51:01,079
Nobody's gonna try to double-cross you,
Nicky... We've been trying to...

626
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:05,675
Nicky...

627
00:51:06,244 --> 00:51:10,480
- Alex... I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, well, we're all sorry, aren't we?

628
00:51:11,043 --> 00:51:13,481
There's no reason
for you to bring her here.

629
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:16,842
The fact that you gave
that coin to him...

630
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:19,481
tells me there are many reasons,

631
00:51:19,481 --> 00:51:21,880
but only one I care about.

632
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:23,721
Why would we try to betray you?

633
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:27,639
Well, Ripley, in your case, perhaps,

634
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:29,360
a misguided sense of revenge.

635
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,438
His, perhaps, simply greed.

636
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,998
It doesn't matter.

637
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,438
I will not take the chance
of the two of you...

638
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:42,389
taking what is rightfully mine
and selling it to the highest bidder.

639
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:46,996
Please, excuse me, Mr. Petrovich...

640
00:51:46,996 --> 00:51:49,155
Will you please? Thank you.

641
00:51:49,157 --> 00:51:54,347
Where is it written
that these eggs are yours?

642
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:59,391
Because they belong to my family.

643
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:05,463
Because my great-grandfather
made them.

644
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:08,472
Yes, Ripley.
Evgenly Petrovich made them.

645
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:17,911
He made the 1917 mystery eggs.

646
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:20,231
I will have those eggs.

647
00:52:20,231 --> 00:52:24,306
And you will get them for me.

648
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,429
That's why I bring Alexandra here.

649
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:32,425
To keep me company while you do
what you need to do.

650
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:35,744
Go.

651
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:44,543
Anyone tries to follow us, she dies.

652
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:47,619
You'd better believe she dies.

653
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:51,780
If I don't get what I want...

654
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:53,775
she dies.

655
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:56,664
Go.

656
00:52:56,664 --> 00:52:59,534
There is a subway not far.

657
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:05,141
Damn you, Gabriel!

658
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:07,262
I told you not to get her involved.

659
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:09,302
You told me? You told me?

660
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:12,501
You and her father got her involved
even before she was born.

661
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:15,815
Goddamn it: We go tomorrow.

662
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:25,427
How much time?

663
00:55:25,717 --> 00:55:28,748
Just over three minutes
until the 22:00 check.

664
00:57:46,932 --> 00:57:50,451
Smart card. Come on...
Come on.

665
00:57:54,052 --> 00:57:55,840
Let's go.

666
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:17,556
Rasputin.

667
01:00:19,922 --> 01:00:21,800
Rasputin.

668
01:00:21,802 --> 01:00:24,114
Seventeen.

669
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,679
Seventeen.

670
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:30,996
- Norway.
- Norway.

671
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:34,748
Cheys Grodny?

672
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:37,838
Cheys Grodny?

673
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:39,717
Fuck.

674
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:43,715
- It wants to know if I'm hungry.
- Are you?

675
01:00:44,878 --> 01:00:46,666
Cheys Grodny?

676
01:00:48,117 --> 01:00:50,827
Cheys Grodny?

677
01:00:51,516 --> 01:00:53,306
Nyet.

678
01:01:40,748 --> 01:01:43,697
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.

679
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:52,621
Go.

680
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:01,896
Stop. Go right.

681
01:02:03,983 --> 01:02:07,536
Right... Right.

682
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,452
Stop.

683
01:02:09,782 --> 01:02:12,378
Good. Straight ahead.

684
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,731
Go, go, go, go, go.

685
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:23,016
Stop. Flatten out.
Head down, head down, head down.

686
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,813
Okay, now diagonally left.

687
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:31,057
Diagonally to the left.

688
01:02:35,657 --> 01:02:38,016
Keep going... Left.

689
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:39,856
Get your arm in. No arms!

690
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,735
- Flat. Down.
- Holy shit.

691
01:02:42,737 --> 01:02:46,003
Okay, straight ahead.

692
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:52,213
Go, go, go, go, go.

693
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:54,652
Go, go.

694
01:02:58,494 --> 01:03:00,282
Stop. Stop.

695
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:03,492
Deploy.

696
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:13,369
Hurry.

697
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,760
Stop. Stop. Flat. Flat.

698
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,076
Okay, hurry.

699
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:41,554
Quick as you can.

700
01:03:45,085 --> 01:03:47,034
Good.

701
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:55,876
It's working. Let's go!

702
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,949
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

703
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:27,987
- Lead.
- Okay... Let's take a look.

704
01:04:42,635 --> 01:04:45,034
When? Shit!

705
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:47,313
All right, sit tight.
We're on our way.

706
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:49,706
Yes, I owe you.

707
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:51,913
They're havin ' a sale at Romanov.

708
01:04:51,914 --> 01:04:52,952
Sir?

709
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:56,632
That was my plant. Unexplained alarm
went off about an hour ago.

710
01:04:56,632 --> 01:04:58,672
I want all available units
in the garage now.

711
01:04:58,672 --> 01:05:01,431
Vouti and Michaels, have them
meet us at the staging area.

712
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:04,188
- Yes, sir.
- Now it's my turn.

713
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,940
We're good.

714
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:21,224
All right.

715
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:28,025
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

716
01:05:28,027 --> 01:05:30,498
- You're on.
- All right.

717
01:05:30,706 --> 01:05:32,306
- A little more.
- Ready?

718
01:05:32,306 --> 01:05:34,144
Come on, a little more.

719
01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:35,625
Come on. More, more, more.

720
01:05:35,626 --> 01:05:40,134
More, more, more.
Stop! Okay... Right there.

721
01:05:42,144 --> 01:05:44,661
- All right.
- Okay.

722
01:05:45,304 --> 01:05:46,983
One.

723
01:05:46,983 --> 01:05:48,818
No.

724
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,181
Two.

725
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:54,893
No... Three.

726
01:05:54,942 --> 01:05:57,494
No... Four.

727
01:06:00,262 --> 01:06:02,019
Hold it! That's it.

728
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:03,809
Four, one.

729
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:07,257
No... Four, two.

730
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,492
No... Four, three.

731
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,856
No... Four, four.

732
01:06:14,498 --> 01:06:17,811
No... Four, five.

733
01:06:20,338 --> 01:06:22,376
Bingo.

734
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,456
- Go, go, go! Let's go!
- Yes, sir.

735
01:06:25,456 --> 01:06:27,576
Sometime tonight. How about it?

736
01:06:27,577 --> 01:06:30,206
- All right.
- All right.

737
01:06:30,295 --> 01:06:33,655
Four, five, six, one, two.

738
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:36,173
Got it. Got it.

739
01:06:36,175 --> 01:06:41,092
Four, five, six, one, two, three.

740
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,012
No.

741
01:06:44,014 --> 01:06:49,045
Four, five, six, one, two, four.

742
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:52,251
No... One.

743
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:53,291
No.

744
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,730
Two, five... No.

745
01:06:56,731 --> 01:06:58,679
Damn it.

746
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:04,438
Four, five, six, one, two, six.

747
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,248
- Bingo.
- Okay.

748
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,038
Okay.

749
01:07:10,648 --> 01:07:13,686
Four, five, six, one...

750
01:07:13,688 --> 01:07:17,605
two, six, one.

751
01:07:20,646 --> 01:07:24,755
One. Come on.

752
01:07:25,206 --> 01:07:29,362
Come on.
What the fuck are you doing?

753
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:32,360
Improvising.

754
01:07:45,443 --> 01:07:49,681
- Shit. Take this shit off.
- Careful.

755
01:07:49,681 --> 01:07:51,920
Come on. Move around this guy.

756
01:07:51,922 --> 01:07:55,918
Move those guys out of the way.
Come on! Go through the lights!

757
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,588
There.

758
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:55,269
Hmm.

759
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:58,300
There should be two
of these boxes.

760
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,217
All right.

761
01:09:28,224 --> 01:09:30,012
Okay.

762
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,695
- What're you doing?
- Give me the box.

763
01:09:56,418 --> 01:09:59,130
- Gabriel, don't do this.
- Give me the box.

764
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:02,896
What, you want more money? Hell...
look around you. Take what you want.

765
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:06,131
Just, shut up
and give me the box.

766
01:10:06,737 --> 01:10:09,235
What about Alex?
Nicky will kill her. You know that.

767
01:10:09,237 --> 01:10:11,774
I will ask you one more time.

768
01:10:13,055 --> 01:10:15,795
Why are you doing this?

769
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:21,213
I'm a cop...
In Miami for the last ten years.

770
01:10:21,215 --> 01:10:23,893
Weber requested me.
Just for you.

771
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:30,851
So you're a cop.
You wanna arrest me? Go ahead.

772
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:32,652
Where am I gonna go?

773
01:10:32,653 --> 01:10:36,451
But in one minute that vault door's
gonna lock and we'll be stuck in here...

774
01:10:36,452 --> 01:10:38,411
and Alex is gonna be dead.

775
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:41,090
I can't believe you're such
a contemptible human being...

776
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:43,729
that you would use her like that
and then just kill her...

777
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,168
cos you might as well
be pulling the trigger yourself.

778
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:49,609
Simply to bag
the great Keith Ripley.

779
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:53,443
You sorry, sick motherfucker.

780
01:10:56,257 --> 01:10:59,636
- You got 30 seconds.
- How do I find Nicky?

781
01:11:00,368 --> 01:11:02,166
Phone number in my pocket.

782
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,877
Give it to me...
and the eggs.

783
01:11:05,487 --> 01:11:09,079
- Do you want her alive or not?
- Do you?

784
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:23,313
Ten seconds.

785
01:11:24,762 --> 01:11:26,551
I'm sorry.

786
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:55,396
Underground, boys.

787
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:58,073
All right, let's move!
Come on!

788
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:46,467
I'm a police officer!
Listen to me.

789
01:12:46,469 --> 01:12:48,426
There is a thief
locked in your inner vault.

790
01:12:48,427 --> 01:12:50,707
The guard is in the basement closet.

791
01:12:50,707 --> 01:12:54,786
Move, move, move,
move, move!

792
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,265
Now! Move! Come on!

793
01:12:57,266 --> 01:13:00,181
Tell them to put
their weapons down now.

794
01:13:01,305 --> 01:13:03,104
Now!

795
01:13:03,105 --> 01:13:05,702
Okay. Fine.

796
01:13:07,824 --> 01:13:09,144
Put them down:

797
01:13:09,145 --> 01:13:10,342
Now!

798
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:18,100
Kick them. Now!

799
01:13:20,422 --> 01:13:22,301
What do you want?

800
01:13:22,301 --> 01:13:25,461
You let me out the front door
so I can rejoin my unit.

801
01:13:25,462 --> 01:13:27,460
They have the building surrounded.

802
01:13:27,461 --> 01:13:30,979
Meantime, you go downstairs,
you find your thief and your comrade.

803
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,578
- You understand?
- That door is alarmed.

804
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:35,139
You have a problem, solve it.

805
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:38,213
Do not make me
shoot this man, please.

806
01:14:15,012 --> 01:14:17,331
- Put down your weapons.
- We are police!

807
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:20,610
Yeah? Everybody's police tonight.

808
01:14:27,091 --> 01:14:28,128
Hello?

809
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,887
Hey, I have what you want.
No, it's just me.

810
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:56,600
Can we talk?
I have a proposition for you.

811
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:08,391
Where is she?

812
01:15:12,323 --> 01:15:16,720
Do not move.
He has a gun behind the box.

813
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:17,841
Bad boy.

814
01:15:17,841 --> 01:15:20,960
Give me the box
and give Andrei your weapon, please.

815
01:15:20,961 --> 01:15:22,239
We don't wish trouble here.

816
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,238
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

817
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:26,759
You let her go,
then I'll give you the box.

818
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,557
You see, if I fire through this box,

819
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,997
which I have no problem
doing what so ever,

820
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:34,677
Nicky's not gonna
be very happy.

821
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:37,115
Then we are all expendable.

822
01:15:37,637 --> 01:15:39,676
If you understand
the meaning of the word.

823
01:15:39,677 --> 01:15:41,796
Open the box.

824
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:44,756
Lower the gun.
Lower the gun.

825
01:15:44,756 --> 01:15:47,466
Lower it.

826
01:15:51,475 --> 01:15:53,310
Okay.

827
01:16:00,194 --> 01:16:03,551
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm just lovely. Thanks.

828
01:16:03,552 --> 01:16:06,582
You go.

829
01:16:13,591 --> 01:16:15,426
Give me the box.

830
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,029
- Get in.
- Why?

831
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:22,342
Nicky wants too see you.

832
01:16:23,869 --> 01:16:25,863
Give me your weapon.

833
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,828
We're fine, right?

834
01:16:36,987 --> 01:16:39,746
Where do you get off detaining us?

835
01:16:39,747 --> 01:16:41,506
My apologies, Lieutenant Weber.

836
01:16:41,506 --> 01:16:44,225
My security were,
understandably, confused.

837
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,904
Please go with Mr. Sergev
down to the vault.

838
01:16:46,905 --> 01:16:49,774
We have what you want. Please.

839
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:02,502
- Where's the other one?
- Nobody else. Just him.

840
01:17:02,502 --> 01:17:04,974
Where the hell's my man?

841
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:11,176
Lieutenant, your personal life,
none of my business.

842
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:15,333
I apologize for bringing you here...

843
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:20,019
but I had to be sure the eggs
were genuine before I let you go.

844
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:25,051
Your lack of trust
is really depressing, Mr. Petrovich.

845
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,774
I'm a man of my word.

846
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:32,851
She should be with her godfather now.

847
01:17:35,016 --> 01:17:37,011
Let's see.

848
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:40,092
- Do you mind?
- Sure... Call.

849
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,923
Yeah.

850
01:17:53,094 --> 01:17:56,453
- Hello?
- Hey. Where are you?

851
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,572
I'm at the jail. I had to see him.

852
01:17:59,573 --> 01:18:00,890
How is he?

853
01:18:00,891 --> 01:18:02,490
Well, how do you think he is?

854
01:18:02,492 --> 01:18:05,131
I had no choice, Alex.

855
01:18:05,131 --> 01:18:06,409
No one had a choice.

856
01:18:06,411 --> 01:18:11,488
Remember? I told you.
Neither one of us could promise a thing.

857
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:14,929
Listen, promises blow away in the wind.

858
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,807
But feelings are real.

859
01:18:16,809 --> 01:18:20,368
And I need to know
were the feelings lies, too?

860
01:18:20,368 --> 01:18:23,921
Listen, listen.
What I mean is...

861
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,402
are we real?

862
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:36,005
- I've gotta go, Gabriel. Good night.
- Walt Don't go

863
01:18:36,006 --> 01:18:38,284
Hold...

864
01:18:45,724 --> 01:18:48,115
Are you satisfied?

865
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:58,400
Did you see them?

866
01:18:58,402 --> 01:19:02,238
- Actually, we were in a hurry.
- Look.

867
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,757
They are simply...

868
01:19:13,759 --> 01:19:15,673
wood?

869
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:36,583
- Oh, my God:
- Simply wood?

870
01:19:39,914 --> 01:19:42,313
It was 1917, Gabriel.

871
01:19:42,314 --> 01:19:44,953
Russia. People were starving.

872
01:19:44,953 --> 01:19:48,712
There were no jewels,
no diamonds left.

873
01:19:48,712 --> 01:19:50,945
No hope.

874
01:19:51,193 --> 01:19:55,427
Yet Czarina Alexandra
had to have her eggs.

875
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:00,144
Perhaps you understand
why we had a revolution.

876
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:04,225
People needed
to believe in something.

877
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:09,106
Take him home.

878
01:20:14,068 --> 01:20:15,983
Gabriel.

879
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:23,296
I know what they say about me
but I'm not a killer.

880
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:27,024
Merely a humble immigrant.

881
01:20:27,025 --> 01:20:29,463
Probably much like you.

882
01:20:30,345 --> 01:20:32,975
I don't think so, Mr. Petrovich.

883
01:20:34,104 --> 01:20:36,974
You're not like me at all.

884
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:50,661
Excellent. Thanks.
We've got Petrovich.

885
01:20:50,662 --> 01:20:54,340
Snitch called it in. After all this time
looking for him, you know where he was?

886
01:20:54,341 --> 01:20:56,579
I'm sure you'll tell us.

887
01:20:56,581 --> 01:20:58,498
On the boardwalk,
watchin ' the sun come up.

888
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,609
He's coming in now.
I'll be right back.

889
01:21:04,219 --> 01:21:08,578
Yeah, what I didn't count on
was that a so-called professional...

890
01:21:08,578 --> 01:21:10,577
would be manipulated by a chick.

891
01:21:10,578 --> 01:21:12,337
What kind of cops
do they make in Miami?

892
01:21:12,337 --> 01:21:14,537
Good ones, Weber.
Good ones.

893
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,416
I don't get it.

894
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:20,493
All these years in that world.
How do you let an asset use you?

895
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:23,734
Sometimes things... change.

896
01:21:23,735 --> 01:21:27,854
Things change?
Like, "which side am I on" change?

897
01:21:27,854 --> 01:21:30,333
Ripley, what is he,
your best friend now?

898
01:21:30,335 --> 01:21:32,292
Actually, a better friend than you.

899
01:21:32,293 --> 01:21:35,172
Ah, I get it. I'm the asshole.

900
01:21:35,173 --> 01:21:37,212
You're gonna tell me
what a good guy he is...

901
01:21:37,213 --> 01:21:40,011
or how he got caught up
in a situation he couldn't control,

902
01:21:40,012 --> 01:21:42,612
or how the sins of the father
shouldn't rest on the daughter?

903
01:21:42,613 --> 01:21:45,610
Give me something better
than, "things change".

904
01:21:45,612 --> 01:21:49,561
All I can give you is the truth.

905
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:54,800
Oh, fuck it.
Go back to Miami, Martin.

906
01:21:56,529 --> 01:22:00,448
When your superiors get my report,
you'll be lucky if you have a job.

907
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:02,328
We'll see.

908
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:04,207
Hey, say anything
you want about Ripley...

909
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,646
but nothing changes
the fact that I finally got him.

910
01:22:06,648 --> 01:22:11,282
Now when he leaves prison,
he'll be leaving in a pine box.

911
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:14,086
Let's go see Mr. Petrovich.

912
01:22:26,925 --> 01:22:28,759
No.

913
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:37,921
- That's not Nicky Petrovich.
- What?

914
01:22:38,443 --> 01:22:40,230
Not him.

915
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:46,079
Look, man, Organized Crime
confirmed it. That's Nicky Petrovich.

916
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:48,800
Well, I don't care. That's not him.

917
01:22:48,801 --> 01:22:51,719
I was there, remember?

918
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,838
There's no case here.

919
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,518
- What? Of course there's a case.
- You really think I'll put him on the stand?

920
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:00,837
An undercover Miami cop
who may or may not be legit?

921
01:23:00,838 --> 01:23:01,957
- No offence.
- None taken.

922
01:23:01,957 --> 01:23:04,997
A cop who's the centerpiece
of a botched undercover operation...

923
01:23:04,997 --> 01:23:07,115
that was officially ordered stopped?

924
01:23:07,117 --> 01:23:09,796
I won't embarrass the Bureau,
much less your department,

925
01:23:09,796 --> 01:23:13,034
which accepted tons of money
and equipment from the Russian Mafia.

926
01:23:13,036 --> 01:23:16,755
What about Romanov's? What about
the goddamn stolen treasures of Russia?

927
01:23:16,756 --> 01:23:17,875
What about it, Weber?

928
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:19,514
When Zykov found Ripley in the vault,

929
01:23:19,515 --> 01:23:21,873
he had everything cleared out
before you could get in.

930
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:24,432
I have a proposition for you.

931
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:27,712
There's no way Romanov's
will press charges against Ripley.

932
01:23:27,713 --> 01:23:32,152
Cos they can never admit that the eggs
or anything else ever existed.

933
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:34,990
So we can't even prove
that Detective Martin and Ripley.

934
01:23:34,992 --> 01:23:36,310
stole even a goddamn dime.

935
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,625
But you must have mug shots.

936
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:41,701
Russian Mafia,
known associates, something.

937
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:06,260
That's him.

938
01:24:06,827 --> 01:24:08,585
That's Nicky Petrovich.

939
01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:11,694
- Detective Martin...
- Yeah?

940
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:14,657
That's Victor Korolenko.

941
01:24:24,543 --> 01:24:26,492
Presumed dead.

942
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:29,698
We just never found the body.

943
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:35,659
You never will...

944
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:37,975
Lieutenant.

945
01:25:21,092 --> 01:25:22,851
Weber.

946
01:25:22,853 --> 01:25:23,891
What?

947
01:25:23,893 --> 01:25:27,251
His lawyer got him in front of a judge
on an expedited bail hearing.

948
01:25:27,252 --> 01:25:28,770
Then he just walked.

949
01:25:28,771 --> 01:25:31,171
- Who was it?
- Who was what?

950
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:34,770
- The lawyer.
- Who the fuck do you think?

951
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:38,037
Alex. Korolenko.

952
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:02,604
You can't promise me anything so...

953
01:26:02,605 --> 01:26:05,680
maybe we shouldn't even try.

954
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:46,993
Papa.

955
01:26:47,518 --> 01:26:49,556
Shall we go?

956
01:27:00,475 --> 01:27:01,514
Yeah?

957
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:04,434
Didn't wanna leave
without saying goodbye...

958
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:06,953
I owe you one Gaby.

959
01:27:06,953 --> 01:27:08,313
The real Nicky Petrovich...

960
01:27:08,314 --> 01:27:11,992
is the one Zykov is funneling
the contraband through.

961
01:27:12,592 --> 01:27:16,511
Thank you, but Zykov and Petrovich
have gone to ground.

962
01:27:16,512 --> 01:27:19,110
- Check out a disco called...
- Riga Rose?

963
01:27:19,112 --> 01:27:22,030
Ahh, I see you're familiar
with the territory.

964
01:27:22,032 --> 01:27:24,829
Well... I am a cop, remember?

965
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:26,670
I never forgot it for a second.

966
01:27:26,671 --> 01:27:28,550
When did you know?

967
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:32,149
I knew you were coming
up from Miami before you did Gaby.

968
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:33,429
See Weber and I...

969
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:36,028
Well, let's just say
we share the same sources,

970
01:27:36,029 --> 01:27:37,507
only I pay better.

971
01:27:37,509 --> 01:27:39,028
Sir, we're good to go.

972
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:41,546
So why the help Ripley?

973
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:43,506
Maybe feeling guilty?

974
01:27:45,068 --> 01:27:47,466
Guilt's not even in my vocabulary.

975
01:27:47,466 --> 01:27:50,542
I was just hoping
you'd see things differently.

976
01:27:51,826 --> 01:27:54,935
Together you and I could do anything.

977
01:27:55,586 --> 01:27:58,663
Yeah. I believe we did.

978
01:27:58,664 --> 01:28:01,823
I'll get in touch later on,
if you're interested.

979
01:28:01,824 --> 01:28:03,962
Meanwhile, I've got to keep
an appointment with a man...

980
01:28:03,963 --> 01:28:05,903
who's gonna pay
dearly for something...

981
01:28:05,904 --> 01:28:09,854
he's got to keep locked
in his basement just to say it's his.

982
01:28:11,262 --> 01:28:13,939
- Good hunting, Gaby.
- Wait, wait, wait!

983
01:28:14,301 --> 01:28:16,180
Let me talk to her.
Just for a second.

984
01:28:16,181 --> 01:28:18,940
- That's him?
- What makes you think she's going anywhere?

985
01:28:18,942 --> 01:28:20,380
She didn't commit any crime.

986
01:28:20,381 --> 01:28:24,412
She just lied to someone
who was lying to her.

987
01:28:34,538 --> 01:28:36,537
You be good.

988
01:28:36,537 --> 01:28:39,293
I'll try, Uncle Keith.

989
01:28:39,537 --> 01:28:43,695
Although I suspect
my legal career just ended.

990
01:28:43,697 --> 01:28:46,692
Thank God.

991
01:29:14,851 --> 01:29:18,569
You come in here every night
and every night I tell you...

992
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:21,929
I don't know shit
from this Petrovich.

993
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:25,649
This is a nightclub, my friend.

994
01:29:25,649 --> 01:29:27,768
You know what I think?

995
01:29:28,168 --> 01:29:32,327
I think you need to check out
the action and get your ass laid.

996
01:29:32,328 --> 01:29:35,287
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm sayin', dude?

997
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:38,157
Find yourself a chick.

998
01:29:48,286 --> 01:29:51,962
Vodka.

999
01:29:52,444 --> 01:29:53,804
Zakuska?

1000
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,882
Russian hors d'eurvres
to coat the stomach.

1001
01:29:55,884 --> 01:29:57,912
Oh.

1002
01:29:58,163 --> 01:30:01,801
- Will my stomach need coating?
- I hope so.

1003
01:30:01,802 --> 01:30:04,162
I thought you didn't drink.

1004
01:30:04,162 --> 01:30:05,560
You thought a lot of things,

1005
01:30:05,561 --> 01:30:09,041
but I believe I mentioned something
about making assumptions.

1006
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:12,920
Maybe that's a concept
we should get rid of. Immediately.

1007
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:15,676
My name is Gabriel Martin.

1008
01:30:15,881 --> 01:30:17,908
I'm from Miami.

1009
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:23,037
I was actually looking for a lawyer
but the office was closed.

1010
01:30:23,038 --> 01:30:24,757
So...

1011
01:30:24,759 --> 01:30:27,197
I came here.

1012
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:32,237
Okay.

1013
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:36,355
My name is Alexandra Korolenko...

1014
01:30:36,356 --> 01:30:39,675
and I come from St. Petersburg.

1015
01:30:39,676 --> 01:30:42,431
By way of Little Odessa.

1016
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:44,953
And...

1017
01:30:44,954 --> 01:30:47,313
I love to dance.

1018
01:30:47,954 --> 01:30:51,746
So... I came here tonight.

1019
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:59,628
Do you wanna dance with me?

1020
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:03,020
Yeah.

1021
01:31:04,872 --> 01:31:07,945
I'm willing to make a fool of myself.

1022
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:12,907
Me too.

1023
01:31:13,829 --> 01:31:15,588
- Alex...
- Yeah?

1024
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:19,347
That night when I called you
from... huh, Coney Island,

1025
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:21,787
you never answered my question.

1026
01:31:21,788 --> 01:31:23,987
Which one?

1027
01:31:24,467 --> 01:31:27,542
I wanted... I want to know...

1028
01:31:30,546 --> 01:31:32,699
Was it all lies?

1029
01:31:40,345 --> 01:31:43,180
Not the part that matters.

1030
01:31:52,622 --> 01:31:54,742
That was true.

1031
01:31:55,063 --> 01:31:57,461
That was real.
I felt that.

1032
01:31:57,462 --> 01:32:00,020
That was real.
That was real. Finally.
