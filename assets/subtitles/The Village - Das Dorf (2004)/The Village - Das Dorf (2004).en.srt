1
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,636
Who'll pinch me to wake me up?

2
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,393
Who will laugh at me when I fall?

3
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,650
Whose breath will I listen for...

4
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,197
...so that I may sleep?

5
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,367
Whose hand will I hold...

6
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,163
...so that I may walk?

7
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:04,643
<i>We may question ourselves
at moments such as these.</i>

8
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,856
<i>Did we make the right decision
to settle here?</i>

9
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,578
We are grateful for the time
we have been given.

10
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,992
What manner of spectacle has attracted
your attention so splendidly?

11
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:11,038
I ought to carry it in my pocket
to help me teach.

12
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,215
Who came upon this?

13
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,930
- Philip, did you move this?
- No, Mr. Walker.

14
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:40,025
I inspected it carefully. Its head was
twisted back and much of its fur removed.

15
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,278
- I see.
- It was murdered.

16
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,656
But who is the culprit?

17
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:49,117
Who has done this heinous act?

18
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,330
- Those We Don't Speak Of killed it.
- There it is.

19
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,084
Why would such a notion
come into your mind?

20
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
- They're meat eaters.
- Mmm.

21
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,298
They have large claws.

22
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,342
Children...

23
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:10,973
...Those We Don't Speak Of have not
breached our borders for many years.

24
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,018
We do not go into their woods,

25
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,188
they do not come into our valley.

26
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,190
It is a truce.

27
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,609
We do not threaten them.

28
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,695
Why would they do this?

29
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:29,491
And we ought not to overlook
the Flight of the Birds.

30
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,829
We didn't have it last year
and I, for one, missed it desperately.

31
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,877
And I know your wife missed
the children dressed in feathers and such.

32
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,254
- I am fond of it.
- Mmm.

33
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,716
I do not have a say in this matter.

34
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,218
August Nicholson is chair
of today's meeting.

35
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:55,309
There's a young man who has
requested a word with the elders.

36
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,811
Well, do have him come forward.

37
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,024
Alice.

38
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,112
<i>Hello, Lucius.</i>

39
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,954
"My mother is unaware
of the reason for my visit today."

40
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:21,210
"She did not give her consent
or consult me in any form."

41
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,633
"The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness,

42
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,427
and other events,
have weighed on my thoughts."

43
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,556
"I ask permission to cross
into the forbidden woods

44
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,767
and travel to the nearest town."

45
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,771
"I will gather new medicines,
and I will return."

46
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,482
"With regards to
Those We Don't Speak Of,

47
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,068
I am certain they will let me pass."

48
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,572
"Creatures can sense emotion and fear."

49
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:54,201
"They will see I am pure of intention,
and not afraid."

50
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,703
"The end."

51
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,213
<i>What goes on
in that head of yours?</i>

52
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,009
Say something, Lucius.

53
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,767
Finton Coin is in the tower,
and I've promised to sit with him.

54
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,186
Hmm.

55
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,066
Do you ever think of the towns, Finton?

56
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,569
The towns?

57
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,154
What for?

58
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:35,367
They're wicked places
where wicked people live. That's all.

59
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,500
Thank you, Lucius.

60
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,003
You're a good friend.

61
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,843
I do hope no one saw you.

62
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:19,703
What we seem to have amongst us
is a predator of some type,

63
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,707
most likely a coyote or a wolf.

64
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,671
Its manner of... of killing
and removing the fur,

65
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,925
but leaving the flesh torn,

66
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:37,054
may be a sign that this animal
suffers from madness.

67
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,891
And for the next fortnight,
we should be vigilant

68
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,393
for sightings of this coyote.

69
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,689
Keep careful watch over
our little ones as they play on the hills.

70
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,696
As for the other notion...

71
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,909
...we do not believe
our boundary has been breached.

72
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:05,332
Those We Don't Speak Of are much
larger creatures than coyotes...

73
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,670
...and we would know
if they had been here.

74
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,095
Ahh, it's frightful, this business
with the coyote. Is it not, Papa?

75
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,098
- Do not feel worried, Kitty.
- You are not troubled?

76
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,559
I'm certain it will all end soon.

77
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,188
- Can we speak on other matters, then?
- It would be a relief.

78
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,274
I'm in love!

79
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,735
I want your permission
to marry, Papa.

80
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,238
There's a proper manner in which
things are supposed to happen.

81
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,740
Such as the boy would normally be
standing next to you,

82
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,243
in a moment such as this...
Where is the boy in all this, Kitty?

83
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,704
I haven't spoken to him as of yet.

84
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,374
The young man is unaware
of your intentions?

85
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:52,045
He has a quiet way. I was going to talk with
him, Papa, but not without your blessings.

86
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,256
I won't talk with him without your blessings.

87
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,716
Kitty!

88
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,093
It's Lucius Hunt.

89
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,847
Lucius?

90
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,725
You think badly of him?

91
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,353
- No, no. I have been thinking about him.
- He's not like the other boys, Papa.

92
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,480
He doesn't joke or bounce about.

93
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,900
No, he certainly does not.

94
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,987
Do I have your blessings, then?

95
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,621
Look, do me one favor first.

96
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:31,877
Do not tell anyone else of your burstings
until you have spoken with the young man.

97
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,219
Good afternoon, Lucius.

98
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,142
I wanted to... to... to tell you something.

99
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,314
I love you, Lucius.

100
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,778
I love you... like the day is long.

101
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,364
I love you more than
the sun and the moon together.

102
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:04,785
And if you feel the same way,
then we should not hide it any longer.

103
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,539
It's a gift, love is.
We should be thankful.

104
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,626
We should bellow it out
with all the breath in our lungs.

105
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,504
Thank you! Thank you!

106
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,923
Thank you!

107
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,973
Shh, shh.

108
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,226
Shh.

109
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:36,900
Baby, sleep, gently sleep

110
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:42,364
Life is long and love is deep

111
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:47,744
Time will be sweet for thee

112
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,206
All the world to see

113
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,419
Time to look about and know

114
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:59,381
How the shadows come and go

115
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:05,137
How the breeze stirs the trees

116
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:09,349
How the blossoms grow

117
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:25,282
I often wondered if you and my son bonded
because neither of you is fond of speaking.

118
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,367
You're very kind.

119
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,205
You must pardon my manners.
I haven't slept in many nights.

120
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,840
<i>You are doing capital,
Jamison.</i>

121
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,511
Just a few more moments, huh?
Gather your bravery.

122
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:49,723
Do not jostle about so. You'll ruin my shirt.

123
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,691
They made a sound when I made a sound,
and they mimic before they attack.

124
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,153
Have courage, man.
That's a wives' tale. It isn't true.

125
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,822
Do not falter. Steel yourself!

126
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,622
<i>You know,
like a dog can smell you.</i>

127
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,667
- Pardon me, Mr. Nicholson?
- Hmm.

128
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,799
You may run from sorrow, as we have.

129
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,385
Sorrow will find you.

130
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,557
It can smell you.

131
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,473
Hurry.

132
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:22,399
I didn't know you could run so fast.

133
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,068
We're still for running and staying... Hey!

134
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,783
<i>Noah ought to be punished. He
whacked little Joseph with a stick again.</i>

135
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,288
- Ouch!
<i>- No more hitting! Put it down!</i>

136
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,498
Ow, ow, ow!

137
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,918
<i>Why don't they grab it?</i>

138
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,472
<i>Noah Percy!</i>

139
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,725
Stop your fussing right this moment.

140
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,031
You're in trouble, you know.

141
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:15,077
- No hitting, no hitting.
- I'm to place you in the quiet room.

142
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,746
Um, I'll cry quarts.

143
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,167
- What if we strike a deal?
- Yeah, capital idea.

144
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,796
It would be prudent to keep our deal
a secret. Can you do that?

145
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,882
Can I keep a secret?
Like a church mouse.

146
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,178
You needn't go to the quiet room
if you a take an oath

147
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,431
to never strike any person again.

148
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,561
- No hitting, no hitting.
- No. No hitting.

149
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,104
- No hitting.
- No hitting.

150
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,523
No hitting.

151
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,151
The deal is struck.

152
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,286
We ought not return right away, huh?

153
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:01,123
What shall we do
with our stolen time?

154
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,833
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

155
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,627
- Hmm. Shall we have a foot race?
- Yes.

156
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,088
- Up the hill to the resting rock?
- No cheating.

157
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,966
What a deeply scandalous thing to say.
I insist you take that back.

158
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,468
Is that the school bell?

159
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,769
Ivy, you cheated!

160
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,189
I know! I'm sorry!

161
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,238
Whoo!

162
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,343
My sister cried a lot.

163
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,931
You wonder how I recognized you?

164
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:04,019
Some people - just a handful,
mind you - give off the tiniest color.

165
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,314
It's faint, like a haze.

166
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:11,693
It's the only thing
I ever see in the darkness.

167
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,196
Papa has it, too.

168
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,325
Do you wonder what your color is?

169
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,994
Well, that I won't tell you.
It's not ladylike to speak of such things.

170
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,497
You shouldn't even have asked.

171
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,923
You run like a boy.

172
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,844
Thank you.

173
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,642
I know why you denied my sister.

174
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,980
When I was younger...

175
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,608
...you used to hold my arm
when I walked.

176
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,737
Then suddenly, you stopped.

177
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,491
One day, I even tripped
in your presence, and nearly fell.

178
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:04,162
I was faking, of course,
but still, you did not hold me.

179
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,000
Sometimes we don't do
things we want to do

180
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,461
so that others won't know
we want to do them.

181
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,849
<i>What?</i>

182
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,778
What's this? Oh, berries.

183
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,198
What a splendid present.

184
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,116
<i>Be cautious.</i>

185
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,493
You are holding the bad color.

186
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:54,046
This color attracts Those We Don't
Speak Of. You must bury it.

187
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,426
You ought not to pick
that color berry any more.

188
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,388
He picked it from his pocket.

189
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:08,060
What's wrong?
Your breathing has changed.

190
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,771
<i>I've never set eyes
on these before.</i>

191
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,399
<i>You did not pick that now.
Where did you find this?</i>

192
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,658
"Today at Resting Rock,

193
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:26,954
Noah Percy handed Ivy Walker berries
of the bad color."

194
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,289
"When asked where
he found these berries,

195
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,667
for they were not like
others I have seen,

196
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,837
he pointed to the drawing
upon Resting Rock."

197
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,633
<i>"It is my belief that Noah Percy
has entered the woods,</i>

198
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,886
<i>and has done so on many occasions."</i>

199
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,265
<i>"It is also my belief that,
because of his innocence,</i>

200
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,810
<i>those creatures who reside
in the woods did not harm him."</i>

201
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,146
"This strengthens my feeling
that they will let me pass

202
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:56,149
if they sense I am not a threat."

203
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:00,445
<i>We shall speak of the town,
just this once,</i>

204
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,532
<i>and we shall never speak of it again.</i>

205
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:11,498
Your father left for the market
on a Tuesday,

206
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,459
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

207
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:23,385
He was found robbed and naked
in the filthy river, two days later.

208
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,186
Why'd you tell me this blackness?

209
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:35,480
So you will know the nature
of what you desire.

210
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:40,152
I do not desire it.
My intentions are true to my word.

211
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,571
I think of nothing
but the people of this village.

212
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:47,659
Forgive me.
I am but scared for my only son's life.

213
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,913
I am not the one with secrets.

214
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,626
What is your meaning?

215
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:00,005
There are secrets
in every corner of this village.

216
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:05,219
Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?

217
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,679
That is for my own well-being,

218
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,642
so the evil things from my past
are kept close and not forgotten.

219
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,228
Forgetting would be to let them
be born again in another form.

220
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,230
Then let us open it.

221
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,649
No!

222
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,235
Perhaps we should speak
with Edward Walker together.

223
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,571
- He may be able...
- He hides, too.

224
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,990
He hides his feelings for you.

225
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,286
Oh.

226
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,003
Sometimes we don't do things,

227
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,841
yet others know we want to do things,
so we don't do them.

228
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,848
What nonsense are you saying?

229
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:58,230
You needn't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

230
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:05,362
You remind me of a colt sometimes.

231
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,497
What makes you think
he has feelings for me?

232
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,962
He never touches you.

233
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,844
There's no escape!

234
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,849
Oh, hello.

235
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,310
I was just playing a game with Noah.

236
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:44,313
The rascal must have gone
to hide in my house again.

237
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,523
Houses are against the rules!

238
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,901
He knows that.

239
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,614
Are you all right?

240
00:26:55,699 --> 00:27:01,205
We're tending to the children tonight,
Kitty and I. I should be with her. Be well.

241
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:10,005
I heard my parents speaking of you.

242
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:14,218
I know of your request to go to the towns.

243
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:18,347
I think it is noble,
but I do not think it is right.

244
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:22,100
Are you not angry
you have no sight?

245
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:26,021
I see the world, Lucius Hunt.

246
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,524
Just not as you see it.

247
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,700
What of Noah, then?

248
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:43,288
What if there are medicines for Noah
that could help him be still and to learn?

249
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:47,501
May we stop speaking of this?
It is putting knots in my stomach.

250
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,467
Kitty is to be married.

251
00:27:56,426 --> 00:28:01,890
She's found love, again,
with Christop Crane.

252
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,393
You think it an odd choice, right?

253
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:10,065
You know, he won't sit back in his chair
for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.

254
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,694
But he does have
a gentlemanly way about him...

255
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,739
...and he does care for my sister deeply.

256
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,368
I think Kitty is blessed.

257
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,124
I am blessed as well.

258
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:30,294
My older sister is now spoken for.

259
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,463
I am now free to receive
interest from anyone...

260
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,968
...who might have interest.

261
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:50,272
<i>I'm going to get you. Oh!</i>

262
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,609
I got you. I got you.
Can you fetch a blanket for me?

263
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,111
<i>Have you seen Noah?</i>

264
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,173
Lucius?

265
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,359
Lucius?

266
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,988
<i>- Hurry, to the cellar!
- Oh, good gracious!</i>

267
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,384
- They're coming. They're coming.
- Close the door.

268
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,011
- Noah, close the door, OK?
- They're coming.

269
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,430
- Close the door.
- Coming!

270
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,642
Here we go.

271
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,437
<i>- Noah, come on inside!
- Come on inside!</i>

272
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:57,733
<i>Everyone, inside!
Everyone, inside!</i>

273
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:24,051
<i>- They're coming. Come on in.
- Let's close the door.</i>

274
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:27,179
<i>- Lucius is outside, walking.
- They're coming.</i>

275
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:31,725
He's inside safe somewhere!
Please, close the door!

276
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,313
He'll come back to make sure we're safe.

277
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,899
Ivy! Ivy, please.

278
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,720
<i>- Please.</i>
- No.

279
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:12,391
Don't let them in.

280
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,644
Come on in.

281
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,230
<i>By the markings we find
this morning on our homes...</i>

282
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:48,779
<i>...I feel they were warning us.
They acted as if threatened.</i>

283
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:53,116
<i>Creatures have never
attacked us without reason.</i>

284
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:56,286
<i>Does anyone here know of a reason...</i>

285
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,290
<i>...why these events may have occurred?</i>

286
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,008
Who has written this note?

287
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,773
"Please read so that all may hear."

288
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:27,359
"I have brought this burden upon us."

289
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:33,991
"On the day before last,
I crossed the forbidden line

290
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:36,368
into Covington Woods..."

291
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:40,497
"... and was witnessed there
by Those We Don't Speak Of."

292
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,375
"I am deeply sorry."

293
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:47,004
"I have shamed myself and my family."

294
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:50,674
"I pray that my actions
will cause no further pains."

295
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,927
"With deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt."

296
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,209
Is he in trouble?

297
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,097
Do not fret.

298
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:51,276
You are fearless in a way
that I shall never know.

299
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,540
We are grateful...

300
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:07,793
...for the time we have been given.

301
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,170
<i>Yes. Yes, indeed.</i>

302
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,218
Cheers.

303
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,305
I had an elder sister.

304
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,183
Mrs. Clack, you've been keeping secrets.

305
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,896
Oh, Kitty reminds me of her so.

306
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,692
<i>What manner of person was she?</i>

307
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,821
- Saucy.
- Oh.

308
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,199
And we fought endlessly.

309
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,414
May I ask her name?

310
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:34,213
Why did she not come
to Covington Woods?

311
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:41,220
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

312
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:46,517
A group of men took her life
in an alley by our home.

313
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,648
Please rise!

314
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:55,025
Come on.

315
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:30,644
She's not going to squeeze
my shirt like that, is she?

316
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:46,660
Many blessings
on this most joyous of days.

317
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,162
It was a rare and lovely ceremony,
was it not?

318
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,623
Glorious.

319
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,796
I saw your hand move to your eyes
on more than one occasion.

320
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,382
That must have been dust of some matter.

321
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,671
<i>Mr. Walker!</i>

322
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,177
<i>- Mr. Walker!
- Mr. Walker!</i>

323
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,474
<i>Behind them.</i>

324
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,768
<i>How did she deal
with this brightness?</i>

325
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:37,646
<i>Help us out.</i>

326
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,148
<i>Where are
the rest of them?</i>

327
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,280
Speak up.

328
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:49,324
- They're in the village.
- What?

329
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,535
They left more warnings.

330
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,871
They wish us to leave.

331
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:56,164
That cannot be.

332
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,834
One saw us.

333
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,128
It ran off into the darkness.

334
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,547
You are certain?

335
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,848
Can you boys stay close to Ivy here?

336
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:16,310
She'll tell you some funny stories
and have you laughing soon.

337
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,653
We will go together.

338
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:24,044
<i>Livestock has been taken
and skinned.</i>

339
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,381
The hides and feathers are missing.

340
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:32,261
There are marks on the door
where it was opened.

341
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:37,933
The marks are high.

342
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:41,395
Coyotes cannot reach that height.

343
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:44,708
The elders are going to have
an inquiry tomorrow.

344
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:49,213
Each member of the village is to be
questioned in the meeting hall.

345
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,715
To see how
the border was breached?

346
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,092
Yes.

347
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:00,349
It is cold outside.

348
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:02,726
You ought to go in.

349
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:08,607
Why are you on this porch?

350
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,776
It is not safe.

351
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:13,195
There are other porches.

352
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,951
Do you find me too much of a tomboy?

353
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,871
I do long to do boy things...

354
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,834
...like that game
the boys play at the stump.

355
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,586
They put their backs to the woods,

356
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:33,340
and see how long they can wait
before getting scared.

357
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:38,136
That's so exciting.

358
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,890
I understand you hold the record.

359
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:46,854
It will never be broken, they say.

360
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:50,315
It's just children's games.

361
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:54,528
How is it you are brave when all
the rest of us shake in our boots?

362
00:44:56,738 --> 00:45:02,202
I do not worry about what will happen,
only what needs to be done.

363
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,291
How did you know I was here?

364
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,710
I saw you out the window.

365
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,338
No...

366
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:16,133
...I won't tell you your color.

367
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,719
Stop asking.

368
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:26,685
When we are married,
will you dance with me?

369
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:30,022
I find dancing very agreeable.

370
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:37,529
Why can you not say what is in your head?

371
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:43,577
Why can you not stop saying
what is in yours?

372
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:49,875
Why must you lead, when I want to lead?

373
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,545
If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance.

374
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:57,841
If I want to speak,
I will open my mouth and speak.

375
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:02,054
Everyone is forever
plaguing me to speak further.

376
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,807
Why? What good is it to tell you

377
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:08,602
you are in my every thought
from the time I wake?

378
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:12,064
What good can come from my saying
I- I sometimes cannot think clearly,

379
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,942
or do my work properly?

380
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:20,113
What gain can rise from my telling you
the only time I feel fear as others do...

381
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:24,326
...is when I think of you in harm?

382
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,623
That is why I am on this porch, Ivy Walker.

383
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,795
I fear for your safety before all others.

384
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:41,593
And, yes...

385
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:45,722
...I will dance with you
on our wedding night.

386
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,326
<i>I had been to the storage shed
twice to fetch food</i>

387
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,453
<i>prior to the wedding ceremony.</i>

388
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:11,623
<i>And the livestock
was untouched at that time?</i>

389
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:14,877
<i>Yes, Mrs. Hunt.
All was as it should be.</i>

390
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:18,130
<i>Thank you, Beatrice.</i>

391
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:28,015
I beg your pardon.

392
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,977
Is it true... about Lucius and Ivy?

393
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:35,981
There are whispers all over the village.

394
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:43,739
We were informed early this morning
of their intentions.

395
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:48,452
<i>It is amazing to witness
which two people love chooses to unite.</i>

396
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:50,954
<i>It follows no rules.</i>

397
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:53,540
Kitty...

398
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,710
I wanted to speak with you first.

399
00:47:56,793 --> 00:48:01,590
I would not want you to feel pain,
in any fashion.

400
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:04,676
You are my cherished one.

401
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,972
If you were to feel badly
about Lucius, I would not have it.

402
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:13,018
One love to sacrifice
another love is not right.

403
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:22,110
There is nothing you could do
that would sacrifice my love for you.

404
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:26,532
You are my cherished one as well.

405
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:37,751
God bless you and your life together.

406
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:59,648
What's happened?

407
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:10,075
Is this about Ivy and myself?

408
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:24,089
I know you are very fond of her.

409
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:26,592
And I know she is fond of you.

410
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:35,142
There are different types of love.

411
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,124
Oh.

412
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:06,798
Oh, God.

413
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:23,273
Oh, Ivy...

414
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,215
Noah?

415
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,388
You'll be late for the meeting hall. Would
you like your father to walk you there?

416
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:59,434
Noah?

417
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,291
Oh...

418
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,085
The bad... The bad color.

419
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:29,882
Oh...

420
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:35,429
The bad color, the bad color...

421
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:46,565
Mama!

422
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:54,323
- I beg your pardon.
- What is it?

423
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:56,825
There's been an accident.

424
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:13,592
Noah Percy was found with quarts
of blood upon his clothes and hands.

425
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:17,137
The blood was not his own,
and he will not speak as to whose it is.

426
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:20,224
God in heaven.

427
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,351
Ivy!

428
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:25,687
<i>Is there anyone injured in here?</i>

429
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,273
<i>Has anyone
been hurt in this home?</i>

430
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:31,443
<i>Is anyone in here?</i>

431
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:34,238
<i>Is anyone hurt in this house?</i>

432
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:46,500
22, 23, 24...

433
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:59,555
31, 32, 33...

434
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:20,576
Lucius?

435
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:24,705
Lucius Hunt!

436
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,625
You answer me right this moment!

437
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:54,234
<i>Is anyone hurt in this house?</i>

438
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:58,572
<i>They're fine.</i>

439
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:00,949
<i>Mr. Walker!</i>

440
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:06,330
<i>Joseph!</i>

441
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:14,880
Papa... I cannot see his color.

442
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,386
Ivy.

443
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,388
Come away. Come away.

444
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,807
Come away. Here, take her.

445
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:28,101
Take her.

446
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:30,979
No!

447
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,818
<i>He has suffered a great deal.</i>

448
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:41,240
He may pass at any time.

449
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:49,122
Please give him all your prayers
and good thoughts.

450
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:51,583
He will hear them.

451
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:42,050
<i>Turn!</i>

452
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:07,284
<i>I am in love.</i>

453
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:10,370
<i>I know.</i>

454
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:13,415
He is in love with me.

455
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:17,252
<i>I know.</i>

456
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:20,255
If he dies...

457
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:24,468
...all that is life to me will die with him.

458
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:30,390
I ask permission...

459
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:34,728
...to travel through Covington Woods...

460
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:40,692
...and go to the towns...

461
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,905
...to retrieve medicines...

462
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,785
...that may save...

463
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:54,122
...Lucius Hunt.

464
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:06,844
You are my father.

465
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:09,346
I will listen to you in all things.

466
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:14,351
I will trust your decision.

467
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:24,820
<i>I've done what I can to close
the wounds. There's an infection.</i>

468
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:27,489
What can be done to mend him?

469
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:31,535
We can only pray.

470
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:36,123
If there were no limitations,
what could be done?

471
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,585
Hmm?

472
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,962
What are you asking me?

473
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:50,512
Is there anything at all
that can be done to mend the boy?

474
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,937
Please, Victor. Would you be so kind
as to answer my question?

475
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:10,949
<i>If the infection is contained,
he may still survive.</i>

476
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:16,205
I must speak up.

477
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:20,334
You have a restless spirit.

478
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,836
I know the thing that is in your head.

479
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:28,133
You're thinking of going to the towns.

480
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:31,470
Tell me I'm wrong.

481
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:38,477
You have made an oath, Edward,
as all have, never to go back.

482
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:42,314
It is a painful bargain,
but no good can come without sacrifice.

483
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,651
These are your words I'm saying.
You cannot break the oath.

484
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:48,153
- It is sacred.
- It is a crime,

485
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:50,739
what has happened to Lucius.

486
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,701
You have taken the oath.

487
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:58,413
You and the rest of the elders...
Are you listening to me?

488
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:00,832
You...

489
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,169
...have taken the oath.

490
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:33,824
The moment I heard my daughter's
vision had finally failed her,

491
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:37,661
and that she would forever be blind,
I was sitting in that very chair.

492
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:42,958
I was so ashamed.

493
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:50,215
What do you know about your grandfather?

494
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:55,429
He was the wealthiest man in the towns?

495
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:58,473
That he was. He had a gift for that.

496
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:04,313
If he was given one dollar, in less than a
fortnight, he would have turned it into five.

497
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:08,358
You do not know of money.
It is not part of our life here.

498
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:11,028
Money can be a wicked thing.

499
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:15,073
It can turn men's hearts black -
good men's hearts.

500
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:18,702
My father could not see this.
For all his gifts,

501
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:24,082
he was a poor judge of a man's character.
Your grandfather was a good man, Ivy.

502
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:26,585
He had a laugh that could
be heard three houses away.

503
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:29,546
He used to hold my hand as I hold yours.

504
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:32,549
He taught me strength
and showed me love,

505
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:38,472
and told me to lead
when others would only follow.

506
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:45,687
Your grandfather, James Walker,
died in his sleep.

507
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:49,316
A man put a gun to his head
and shot him while he dreamed.

508
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:55,280
I tell you this so you will understand
some of the reasons for my actions,

509
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:57,783
and...

510
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:01,328
...and the actions of others.

511
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:08,210
You are a strong one, Ivy.
You lead when others would follow.

512
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:12,047
You see light
when there is only darkness.

513
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,971
I trust you.

514
01:01:20,597 --> 01:01:24,351
I trust you among all others.

515
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:29,982
Thank you, Father.

516
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,693
Ivy, do you know where you are?

517
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:36,697
At the old shed that is not to be used.

518
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,618
Yeah.

519
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:46,415
- Ivy.
- Yes, Father?

520
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,960
Do your very best not to scream.

521
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:59,344
What?

522
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:33,962
I am leaving to fetch you medicines.

523
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:38,300
I had a difficult time getting away.

524
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:40,802
What is it?

525
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,687
Ivy...

526
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:53,065
...has asked...

527
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:56,443
...to go to the towns...

528
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:59,404
...for medicines.

529
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,628
Christop.

530
01:04:41,757 --> 01:04:43,383
Christop...

531
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:45,802
you needn't be scared.

532
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,847
We have the magic rocks.

533
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:51,266
They will keep us safe.

534
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,771
Why have we not heard
of these rocks before?

535
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,775
Christop, please.
Do not leave us.

536
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,277
There is nothing to fear.

537
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,615
Then why do you wear the cloak
of the safe color?

538
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:09,284
We will light torches.

539
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:12,079
It will be safe.

540
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:14,581
It is forbidden.

541
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:18,001
<i>Christop.</i>

542
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:05,007
Ivy...

543
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:07,718
there's something in these woods.

544
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:11,471
It turns my stomach to rot.

545
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:23,817
You will be safe. They will not harm you,
because you cannot see.

546
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:26,695
They will take pity on you,
the way they took pity on Noah

547
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,406
when... when he ventured in the woods.

548
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:34,870
They will kill me, Ivy.

549
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:38,123
I cannot stay.

550
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:47,633
You're better in these woods
than most boys. Anyone would say so.

551
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:50,385
It is my burden, Finton.

552
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,723
- You may go.
- Come with me.

553
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,877
<i>Do your very best not to scream.</i>

554
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:40,269
<i>There's an odd smell.</i>

555
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:47,192
<i>It is ahead of you.</i>

556
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:51,321
<i>What is it?</i>

557
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:53,907
<i>I cannot explain in words.</i>

558
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:57,828
<i>It is just a few steps.</i>

559
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:14,052
- Those We Don't Speak Of!
- Do not be frightened.

560
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:17,890
It is only farce.

561
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:23,854
Do not be frightened.

562
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:39,369
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

563
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:43,290
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.

564
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:47,336
The screams from the woods?

565
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:52,132
We created those sounds.

566
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:54,635
The Ceremony of Meat?

567
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:58,931
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.

568
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:02,226
The drills -
they are farce, too?

569
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:05,479
We did not want anyone
to go to the towns, Ivy.

570
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:12,277
What about the animals -
the skinned ones?

571
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:17,282
- Are the elders responsible for that, too?
- I believe one of the elders is responsible.

572
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,576
It will not happen again.

573
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:23,330
There is no one in this village
who has not lost someone irreplaceable,

574
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:29,837
who has not felt loss so deeply that they
questioned the very merit of living at all.

575
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:32,214
It is a darkness I wished...

576
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,592
...you would never know.

577
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:42,766
Forgive us our silly lies, Ivy.
They were not meant to harm.

578
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:55,445
I am... sad for you, Papa.

579
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,158
For all the elders.

580
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:13,755
On this paper has been written
a tool of medicine.

581
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,883
It is common in the towns.

582
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:19,344
You will go... with two escorts.

583
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:22,389
Follow the sounds of the stream.

584
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:25,684
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

585
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:29,771
At this hidden road, the two escorts
will wait as you continue.

586
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:33,901
You alone will follow the road...

587
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,530
...and leave Covington Woods.

588
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:43,202
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

589
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:45,704
...and return with haste.

590
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:50,626
I cannot come with you.

591
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:57,716
You gave your heart to this boy.

592
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:01,929
He is in need.

593
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:06,517
Are you ready to take this burden,

594
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:11,438
which, by right,
is yours and yours alone?

595
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:23,617
I am making fresh cloths for Lucius.
He needs them.

596
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:25,994
Alice, I've sent for help.

597
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:33,377
I've sent Ivy to the towns.

598
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:37,881
You cannot.

599
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:42,010
It is all that I can give you.

600
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:52,187
It is all that I can give you.

601
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:58,735
I accept.

602
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:23,093
- What have you done?
- He is the victim of a crime.

603
01:12:23,177 --> 01:12:26,638
We have agreed never to go back. Never.

604
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:29,141
What was the purpose of our leaving?

605
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:34,104
Let us not forget it was out of hope
of something good and right.

606
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:36,398
You should not have made
decisions without us.

607
01:12:36,398 --> 01:12:39,276
- You have gone too far.
- I'm guilty, Robert!

608
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:44,865
I made a decision of the heart.
I cannot look into another's eyes

609
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:50,037
and see the same look
I see in August's without justification!

610
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,123
It is too painful. I cannot bear it!

611
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:56,168
You have jeopardized
everything we've made.

612
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:03,383
Who do you think
will continue this place, this life?

613
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:08,263
Do you plan to live forever?

614
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:12,100
It is in them that our future lies.

615
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:16,605
It is in Ivy and Lucius that
this... this way of life will continue.

616
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:20,526
Yes, I have risked! I hope I am always able

617
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,196
to risk everything
for the just and right cause.

618
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:32,162
If we did not make this decision, we could
never again call ourselves innocent.

619
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:37,334
And that, in the end, is what we
have protected here - innocence!

620
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,963
That, I'm not ready to give up.

621
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:49,805
Let her go.

622
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:54,101
If it ends, it ends.

623
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:01,775
We can move towards hope.
It's what's beautiful about this place.

624
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:05,612
We must not run from heartache.

625
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:08,615
You know, my brother
was slain in the towns.

626
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:10,617
The rest of my family died here.

627
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,871
Heartache is a part of life.
We know that now.

628
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,748
Ivy's running toward hope.
Let her run.

629
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:21,753
If this place is worthy,
she'll be successful in her quest.

630
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:26,925
How could you have sent her?

631
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,344
She's blind.

632
01:14:30,095 --> 01:14:33,724
She's more capable
than most in this village...

633
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:38,353
...and she is led by love.

634
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:41,690
The world moves for love.

635
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,612
It kneels before it in awe.

636
01:14:57,831 --> 01:15:01,460
All the world to see

637
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:05,589
Time to look about and know

638
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:09,635
How the shadows come and go

639
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:13,639
How the breeze stirs the trees

640
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:17,684
How the blossoms grow

641
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:21,688
Sleep, baby, sleep

642
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:25,442
Sleep, gently sleep

643
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:39,743
<i>There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.</i>

644
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:42,246
<i>It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.</i>

645
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,596
It is not real.

646
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:07,182
It is not real.

647
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:42,004
<i>Noah?</i>

648
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:47,384
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- What is this?

649
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:49,887
<i>Where is he?</i>

650
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:56,310
<i>He found one of the suits
we kept under the floorboards.</i>

651
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,437
<i>Oh, no.</i>

652
01:22:58,437 --> 01:23:00,647
<i>Oh, God.</i>

653
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:03,025
<i>The animals.</i>

654
01:24:25,816 --> 01:24:28,610
<i>His will to live is very strong.</i>

655
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,821
<i>A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.</i>

656
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:16,950
<i>You alone will follow the road...</i>

657
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:20,787
<i>...and leave Covington Woods.</i>

658
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:26,251
<i>You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...</i>

659
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:29,505
<i>...and return with haste.</i>

660
01:27:30,751 --> 01:27:35,172
<i>My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.</i>

661
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:38,842
<i>A group of men raped and killed her.</i>

662
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:41,970
<i>They stuffed her in a Dumpster...</i>

663
01:27:43,222 --> 01:27:46,391
<i>three blocks from our apartment.</i>

664
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:50,229
<i>My brother worked
in an emergency room downtown.</i>

665
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:54,441
<i>A drug addict came in
with a wound to his ribs.</i>

666
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:57,069
<i>My brother tried to dress the wound.</i>

667
01:27:58,028 --> 01:28:00,781
<i>He pulled a gun from his jacket...</i>

668
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:04,618
<i>...then he shot my brother
through his left eye.</i>

669
01:28:04,743 --> 01:28:06,912
<i>My husband, Michael,</i>

670
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:11,166
<i>left for the supermarket
at a quarter past nine in the morning.</i>

671
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:16,338
<i>He was found
with no money and no clothes</i>

672
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:18,841
<i>in the East River, three days later.</i>

673
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:23,428
<i>My father was shot
by a business partner,</i>

674
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:27,182
<i>who then hanged himself
in my father's closet.</i>

675
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:29,852
<i>They had argued over money.</i>

676
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:31,854
<i>I am a professor.</i>

677
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:37,234
<i>I teach American History
at the University of Pennsylvania.</i>

678
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:39,736
<i>I have an idea...</i>

679
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:43,282
<i>...that I would like to talk to you about.</i>

680
01:28:45,284 --> 01:28:48,662
Mile 27- there's a girl.
I'm gonna check it out.

681
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:51,164
<i>Be careful.</i>

682
01:29:11,185 --> 01:29:14,062
You're not allowed to go in there.

683
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:16,273
Please return to your vehicle.

684
01:29:16,273 --> 01:29:18,692
<i>What was that noise?</i>

685
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:25,324
What are you doing out here?
How... how'd you get here?

686
01:29:25,407 --> 01:29:27,784
Are you from the towns?

687
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:30,579
Uh...

688
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:32,998
Where are you from?

689
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,253
The woods.

690
01:29:41,215 --> 01:29:43,800
You came from the woods?

691
01:29:45,844 --> 01:29:48,222
In there?

692
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:51,683
Will you help me?

693
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:55,896
I need to find a doctor of medicine.

694
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:58,190
<i>I must find these things.
We must make haste.</i>

695
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:00,609
Listen, ma'am.

696
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:03,946
I'm just supposed to...

697
01:30:21,505 --> 01:30:23,924
Is someone hurt?

698
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,928
Please, sir. We must make haste.

699
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:36,186
- Well, you... you live in there?
- I do, sir.

700
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:47,322
<i>Breaker.</i>

701
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:51,660
- What is your name?
- Kevin.

702
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:54,621
Kevin.

703
01:30:55,205 --> 01:30:57,583
You have kindness in your voice.

704
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:01,503
I did not expect that.

705
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:10,429
We have guard shacks every ten miles
around the perimeter of the preserve.

706
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:15,809
We keep medical supplies in there
in case of animal bites or related injuries.

707
01:31:15,893 --> 01:31:19,062
You can find the things
written on the paper?

708
01:31:20,314 --> 01:31:22,524
Uh...

709
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:25,402
- You have to wait here.
- Please, sir.

710
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:27,821
Please... take this as payment.

711
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,830
Wait, y-you're not...

712
01:31:36,914 --> 01:31:39,499
You're not tricking me, are you?

713
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:42,503
I do not understand.

714
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:47,090
What's your name?

715
01:31:47,174 --> 01:31:49,593
Ivy.

716
01:31:50,928 --> 01:31:53,597
Ivy Elizabeth Walker.

717
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:14,910
What's with the girl?
I tried calling you back on the walkie.

718
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:17,496
- You didn't answer.
- Oh, it was just some teenagers.

719
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:20,165
They were lost.

720
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:24,419
Can I give you some advice?
Don't get into conversations.

721
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:28,423
You start talkin', you start gettin' into
how some estate is payin' all of us,

722
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:31,802
and no one's allowed to go in there
and disturb the animal sanctuary.

723
01:32:31,885 --> 01:32:34,304
People's interest gets piqued.

724
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:38,016
It's a really easy gig, Kevin.
Maintain and protect the border.

725
01:32:38,141 --> 01:32:41,979
That's it.
A few years ago,

726
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:44,857
it got out in the papers that some
government guys had been paid off

727
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:48,485
to keep plane routes
from flying over this place.

728
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:50,863
That was a very
stressful time for me.

729
01:32:50,863 --> 01:32:53,073
Don't cause me any troubles.

730
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:55,492
Do not get into conversations.

731
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:47,669
Hey, Jay,
where's the maintenance ladder?

732
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:52,257
I n-need to fix a sign.

733
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:56,011
It's in the back.

734
01:35:02,202 --> 01:35:04,496
Ivy has returned
with medicines from the towns.

735
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:07,374
She was attacked
by a creature and killed it.

736
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,053
Noah.

737
01:35:20,053 --> 01:35:22,431
Oh, God.

738
01:35:22,556 --> 01:35:24,933
We will find him.

739
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:29,855
We will give him...

740
01:35:31,356 --> 01:35:33,775
...a proper burial.

741
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:38,488
We will tell the others...

742
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:44,036
...he was killed by the creatures.

743
01:35:48,165 --> 01:35:50,959
Your son has made our stories real.

744
01:35:54,963 --> 01:35:58,425
Noah has given us a chance
to continue this place...

745
01:36:02,346 --> 01:36:04,765
...if that is something...

746
01:36:07,726 --> 01:36:10,145
...we still wish for.

747
01:37:19,006 --> 01:37:21,508
I'm back, Lucius.
