1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
The Lost Bladesman

2
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,460
Guan Yunchang

3
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,890
Righteous and loyal

4
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,980
What ill fate that met him!

5
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,390
Would there even be another like hỉm?

6
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,150
The word "righteous/moral" composed of the word "sheep" and "self"

7
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,810
He's as kind as a sheep

8
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,710
General Guan stays true to his principles

9
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,480
He's kind and forgiving

10
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,050
His death is a tragedy

11
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,550
You are a wolf on the outside

12
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,740
But has a heart of a sheep

13
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,900
But this world belongs to wolves

14
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,040
World of wolves!

15
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,000
20 years ago....

16
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,800
Kingdom of Han invasions were widespread

17
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,860
This Cao Cao commanded a small troops

18
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,990
Fighting across the land to bring back peace and balance

19
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Then Yuan Shao began to gather his own troops to betrayed our army

20
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,310
With their larger army,

21
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,620
Yuan Shao's commander attacked Boma City

22
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Our small number of troops always fight with cunning and resiliency. Winning every battle

23
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,120
But seeing all the bloodshed,

24
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,320
Our lieutenants were losing their morale

25
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,150
I can lose my cites

26
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,110
But I cannot lose the heart of my men

27
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,310
At the time, Guan Yunchang was under my command

28
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,590
An individual capable of anything

29
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,330
Praised with strength of thousands

30
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,280
I knew very clearly

31
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,560
With this weapon at my disposable

32
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,370
It can determine the outcome of my battles

33
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,610
With him, I will not lose

34
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,960
Unfortunately...the 'ace card'

35
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,420
is in the hand of Liu Bei

36
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,140
The battle card of another, How can I play it?

37
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,480
Brother Yunchang..Let us eat

38
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,350
Eating at times like this sir?

39
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,790
- How are you?
- I want you to help me with one thing

40
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,450
I don't know if you'd agree brother

41
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,150
This Guan situation is weak. It doesn't matter what I say.

42
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,300
Then good, go and kill someone for me

43
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,890
If he's dead, then the fighting would stop?

44
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Correct

45
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,840
Who?

46
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,840
No rush, lets eat then talk

47
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,840
No Rush

48
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,980
Lets kill then eat

49
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,120
The gate is almost breached, stop it

50
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,550
Yes

51
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,490
Sir, Guan Yu is of the enemy

52
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,910
How can he help us?

53
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,260
Anyone in my camp is considered my men

54
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,970
Letting him go is like releasing a tiger back into its jungle

55
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,860
Brother Yuanchang, the Cao's camp has 5000 troops

56
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,860
Can anyone stop you?

57
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,130
I need 30 elite men, who's with me?

58
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,570
This Guan and everyone follows different leaders,

59
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,360
we never fought side by side as brothers

60
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,470
But with battle of today,

61
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,580
Everyone ignored the danger head to help me

62
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,430
No different as if you guys are my brothers

63
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,810
If everyone would accept me

64
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,560
I would like to call you my brothers

65
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,810
My brothers, please accept one bow from me

66
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,090
This Zhang Liao likes to fight, who else?

67
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,300
- My brothers, kill!!!!
- Kill!!!!!

68
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,780
- Kill!!!
- Kill!!!!

69
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,890
- Kill!!

70
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,550
This is your men?

71
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
That's his men?

72
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,580
His highness arrives!

73
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,430
Hear his highness

74
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,210
Guan Yunchang is promoted to Han's Marquis of Hanshou rank

75
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,610
General Guan please bow to receive

76
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,100
Guan Yunchang has no talents? I cannot accepts awards without merits

77
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,570
Brother Yunchang,

78
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,160
You are a loyal person, only you can accept this

79
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,510
To see his highness being oppressed, but us subjects can't do anything

80
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,030
How can you call that loyalty?

81
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,890
So you feel like...his highness is being oppressed here?

82
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,810
It's always been that there'd be no sword in the palace

83
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,740
But nowadays everyone carries one

84
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,100
Is that not disrespect to the king?

85
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,770
It's chaotic out there, all must carry a sword to protect his highness

86
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,660
How can you say that’s disrespectful?

87
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,800
Under his heavenly's presence, How can you Cao Mèngdé not bow?

88
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,860
If you don’t like that, you don’t have to

89
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,840
Guan Yu dare not

90
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,730
What's the big deal anyway

91
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,760
Everyone go back to normal, No need to bow

92
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,880
Stand up!

93
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,380
Stand up..

94
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,250
Stand up!

95
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,770
Brother, the king has spoken

96
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,920
Brother Yunchang , please stand up

97
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,930
Official Guan

98
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,910
Stand up, no need to call me that

99
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,440
You saved my life

100
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,650
it's only right to call you that

101
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,970
You saved your own life. Don't look down on yourself

102
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,250
Sir Guan is a...big hero.

103
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,100
Saving my life is as if you allow me to be reborn.

104
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,380
Guan Yu is not like that

105
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,460
Me and Cao Cao must've misunderstood each other

106
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,860
Sir Guan...

107
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,810
Does have a misunderstand with me

108
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,740
I'll go back to work

109
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,190
Right.

110
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,030
Then how can you explain it sir Cao?

111
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,200
Drink some water first

112
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,250
Sir Guan,

113
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,650
This paddy used to be wild and abandoned

114
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,150
We came here, explored, planted barley

115
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,030
From Luoyang to Xuchang there are thousands

116
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,930
Within 6 years, nobody died from starvation

117
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,260
This Cao Cao is kinda good huh

118
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,100
The Liu's house is crumbling

119
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,350
So our Cao helped them fix it up

120
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,310
But then there’s people saying I tore down his house

121
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,420
Can anyone see this injustice?

122
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,910
You do have poetic words Sir Cao

123
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,110
What poetry, the truth is clear as day

124
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,470
The truth is Cao Cao borrowed his heavenly's word to do it

125
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,840
Using his heavenly's word

126
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,780
I've heard this

127
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,160
It's completely nonsense

128
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,850
It's really His highness that used my Cao Cao name to order such a thing

129
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,770
I know, some will always believe rumors

130
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,370
Even 2000 years later, there'd still be believers (lol. foreshadowing?)

131
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,400
But it's still nonsense rumors

132
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,100
Only 2 type will believe these stuff

133
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,000
1 is stupid, the other is bad guy.

134
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,590
Liu Bei is the bad one, and you're the dumb one.

135
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,290
Liu Bei is taking advantage of you!

136
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,430
Good! I like you brother

137
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,220
Dare to accept your act, dare to love and hate

138
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,300
Stay with me, work for me

139
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,620
If it weren't for 230 Liu members you held

140
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,910
You dare say those words?

141
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,790
Sir Guan

142
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,910
You never kill those that doesn’t deserve it

143
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,810
Right?

144
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,560
Cao Mengde, what are you talking about?

145
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,620
Hurry and work

146
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,150
Your Highness, Cao Cao make you do such labor work?

147
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,610
Sit down

148
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,150
Just look, even generals are out here

149
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,120
What?

150
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,180
You feel that officials, and heavenly bloodlines that

151
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,430
doing things like this, is out of place right?

152
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,710
But unusual times calls for unusual things

153
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,250
Don't stress too much over it

154
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,650
Your highness, you ever thing of leaving here?

155
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,900
These past decades,

156
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,540
Do you know how this King been living?

157
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,350
I move from this palace to that palace,

158
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,270
From this dog hole to this shit hole

159
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,580
I eat spoiled wheat and drink dirty water

160
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,940
And those around me,

161
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,840
They eat off of theirs fallen comrades

162
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,610
Even drinking their blood.

163
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,200
A world so big, but no place for a King to stay put

164
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,070
What kind of world is this?

165
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,920
Do you know what Cao Cao brought

166
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,500
the first time I met hỉm?

167
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,750
White steamed buns, and sizzling meat balls

168
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,890
And a warm cozy bed

169
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,650
Can buns and meatballs be traded for the Han Kingdom like that?

170
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,850
Cao Mengde never said he wants to be king

171
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,690
He doesn't believe that one King can change the world.

172
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,220
Your highness is of heaven's orders.

173
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,870
How can you change the world when you don't believe in the heaven's above

174
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,770
Potential, having potential can change the world.

175
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,480
My kingdom now belongs to Cao Cao

176
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,130
Because Cao Cao is stronger.

177
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,300
But I believe that I will be stronger than him one day

178
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,440
By then, Cao Cao will willingly present the kingdom back to me

179
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,150
If it's true about the heavenly's orders

180
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,750
Then sooner or later the kingdom will be mine.

181
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,520
Sir Guan...

182
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,990
Sir Guan...

183
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:49,970
Little Hầu,

184
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,700
How's your father? He's well?

185
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,730
He's a lot better, the doctor say he needs to continue taking medicine

186
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Sir Guan

187
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,350
Are the rice cooked? I'll go check

188
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,620
It's okay sir, we're just early today

189
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,090
It's no rush big brother.

190
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,660
He is....

191
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,860
It's Cao Mengde, sir Cao

192
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,580
- You are...
- We'll return later

193
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,350
Let's go

194
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,250
They are....

195
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,600
They came to the city 1 month ago

196
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,950
Can't find jobs, nor any food

197
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,530
They in your kingdom. Can you think of something for them?

198
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,650
Don't worry, I'll take care of this situation

199
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,570
Big Brother Guan, He's an evil person.

200
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,810
Don't say that Lil Hầu

201
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,870
Lil Hầu

202
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,120
Sir Cao is our golden ticket

203
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,370
Take this and buy medicine dad, hurry!

204
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,940
Sir Cao,

205
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,740
Yunchang brother,

206
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,350
Goodbye

207
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,890
Goodbye

208
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,430
My ladies,

209
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,440
I've returned those dirty things

210
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,340
2nd Brother greets sisters

211
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,960
Qi Lan, why don't you greet 2nd brother,

212
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,410
With people like him,

213
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,020
there's no need for manners

214
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,690
Qi Lan, it's all Cao Cao's plan

215
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,560
Big brother always trust 2nd brother

216
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,000
You bout to marry into the Liu Family

217
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,360
Don't you trust Liu brother

218
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,670
You can't predict a person mind

219
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,150
Everyone knows that if Guan General

220
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,410
Wants to leave then

221
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,520
No one can stop him

222
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,920
I want you to meet up with Liu brother

223
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,400
Especially while Cao Cao is busy fighting with Yuan Shao at Xuchang

224
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,020
That's helping big brother Liu

225
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,550
Lil sis is right

226
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
2nd brother need not worry about us

227
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,810
Why not do it like Qi Lan said.

228
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,540
2nd brother

229
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,970
I beg you

230
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,660
Please go find big brother Liu

231
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,280
Qi Lan ,

232
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,720
2nd brother himself knows what to do

233
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,710
You and him are from the same town

234
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,460
You of all should know who he is very well

235
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,670
Please give Guan Yu for cannot comply

236
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,390
Please excuse me

237
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,610
Then why are you here?

238
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,250
Not tired today?

239
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,340
Not tired!

240
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,700
Let us rest for a bit

241
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,690
Okay.

242
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,010
This are the things I painted today

243
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,430
Is it pretty?

244
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,170
Check it yourself

245
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,490
Do it more careful

246
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,150
Let me help you

247
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,100
- Mom...
- My daughter is home?

248
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,060
- Dad...
- You're home?

249
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,130
- Are you tired daughter?
- Not tired

250
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,430
Heard the cow carriage guy did it

251
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,660
You didn’t know?

252
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,220
He ran away early this morning

253
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,570
Alright, stop gathering here

254
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,560
Disperse

255
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,060
General Liu is here, we can live in peace now

256
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,720
General Liu

257
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,550
General Liu

258
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,860
Look sis, isn’t that the cow carriage guy?

259
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,820
Don't speak nonsense

260
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,710
The guy is now big General Guan Yunchang

261
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,080
Our peasants can live in peace with the General here

262
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,750
General Liu

263
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,910
This is our daughter

264
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,910
Little lady..

265
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,520
Right!! Cheers to everyone

266
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,270
Cheers!

267
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,180
Cao army is here...

268
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,510
2nd brother, hurry

269
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,760
Dad...Mom...

270
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,100
You say that unofficial wife of Liu Bei

271
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,450
doesn’t know Guan Yu

272
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,240
from her home town Hedong ?

273
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,320
Correct

274
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,040
Any news about Liu Bei?

275
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,540
Liu Bei's fighting Yuan Shao

276
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,090
In battle of Boma, Guan Yu slain general Yan Liang

277
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,390
Yuan Shao got upset and wants to kill Liu Bei

278
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,860
Then is he dead?

279
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,250
For now there isn’t any news

280
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,220
Come on!

281
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,470
Get up son

282
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,910
Dad, lets play again

283
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,380
I told you many times.

284
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,520
General, you are from Hedong right?

285
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,510
Yes

286
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,400
Do you know how to cook Hedong food?

287
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,570
No!

288
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,750
You know general

289
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,410
Yeah, general know for sure

290
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,950
Hedong food has strong flavors, suitable with my liquor

291
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,970
Here, try it

292
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,130
Master brewed it himself, its called (don't understand) Liquor

293
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,760
Just invitation to drink, why prepared troops outside?

294
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,320
Afraid that Guan Yu will attack?

295
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,180
There isn't enough supply for the war

296
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,460
I ordered that supplies couldn't be use to brew liquor

297
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,910
If we brew liquor , penalty is 'head-off'

298
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,770
Then what about the person that drinks it?

299
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,010
Guilty as well!

300
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,700
Then it's General Cao that want to use liquor to kill

301
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,090
Looks like you're scared to drink

302
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,690
Having liquor to drink, why scared?

303
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,790
Good!

304
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,370
General Guan

305
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,060
Us two sitting here drinking and enjoying,

306
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,760
Isn't that against the norm a little bit?

307
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,190
General makes the law, I don't follow it, that is normal.

308
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,650
Well said, General Guan

309
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,990
Good food is rare in this chaotic time

310
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,260
It's the best we have of your home town food

311
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,930
Try it

312
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,680
Do you miss home?

313
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,220
I do not have a home

314
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,310
I let all Liu family members home already

315
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,220
Commanded Zhang Liao to take 50 men and escort them

316
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,380
I respect your act of righteousness

317
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,890
Guan General say that I’m righteous

318
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,410
I dare not accept it

319
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,490
I said you acted righteously

320
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,630
Not saying that you are righteous

321
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,480
Lets just say I'm a nobody

322
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,140
Come, General Guan

323
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,040
Drink with me

324
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,900
I don’t understand one thing

325
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,740
Why are you lowering yourself like this

326
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,180
If it brings me days of peacefulness

327
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,850
Then I'm always willing to lower myself

328
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,660
Guan Yu only know a few barbaric fighting skills

329
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,450
How can that bring tranquility?

330
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,490
Plus the Cao's camp has many talents

331
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,560
Me staying here will only be a bother

332
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,870
Then what about your brothers Liu Bei and Zhang Fei

333
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,030
Everyone knows brother Liu Bei moral

334
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,830
Cause we don't have hatred here?

335
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,860
Also no love

336
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,740
Then its easy

337
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,070
Guan Yunchang join my side, you can have anything

338
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,590
How’s that

339
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,800
You released the Liu Family, I'm indebted to you

340
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,430
I know how to repay it

341
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,690
But in the end Liu Bei is still my sworn brother

342
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,210
When there is news of him , I leave right away

343
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,290
If General Cao thinks that it's like letting a tiger back home

344
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,710
Then its best you kill me

345
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,710
Why are you only loyal to Liu Bei?

346
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,960
If I, Guan Yu, only sway with the wind

347
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,840
Me staying here will bring you trouble eventually

348
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,420
Well said

349
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,500
Only liquor can release sorrow

350
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,400
One's life doesn’t have much chance of drinking, singing

351
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,270
I wrote that line.

352
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,070
Did you know that?

353
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,250
You are not the first to break my liquor law

354
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,570
Who else is there?

355
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,840
The grandson of Kong Qiu (Confucius)

356
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,970
General Kong Rong ?

357
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,050
What general?

358
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,860
Kong Rong giving a pear is easy

359
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,490
But him giving up a bowl of liquor

360
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,320
Is harder than me convincing you to stay

361
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,470
Come

362
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,270
Drink up

363
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,140
Alright, I'm here, thank you

364
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,850
You said you don't have a home!

365
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,590
I'll gift one to you

366
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,840
Would you like to stay brother?

367
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,360
You say this is the place?

368
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,320
This is it!

369
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,780
Thank you

370
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,150
Thank you

371
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,290
In your heart, you never forgot Qi Lan right?

372
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,410
For so long, my heart has been empty

373
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,960
Why not let me have a good dream?

374
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,830
Your heart is empty, how can you have a good dream?

375
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,690
Sir, the potent is in the food

376
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,340
The potent lasts 4 hours

377
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,620
I've paralyzed the girl using pressure points

378
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,960
Before dawn, no one is allow close

379
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,570
Sister, please respect yourself

380
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,960
It's only a dream

381
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,960
No need to be afraid

382
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,500
Even so, I cannot be disrespectful

383
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,100
Even in a dream, you dare not love me?

384
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,180
You weren't scared to kill for me in the past

385
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,750
I only killed to save you

386
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,070
If you won't say it, how can I know what you think?

387
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,280
If you won't say it..., how can I know... what you think?

388
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,450
Let me know....what you are thinking...

389
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,280
Outrageous !

390
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,360
I only know that you're my sister-in-law

391
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,330
Get down here!

392
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,470
How dare you!

393
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,880
Who are you?

394
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,750
General Liu sent me here

395
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,190
Sir Liu is at Ruyang...Yuan Shao's Camp

396
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:41,030
General Guan, I cannot live

397
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,320
General Guan...

398
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,690
General Guan...

399
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,070
General Guan...

400
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,640
General Guan...

401
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,170
I want to see Cao Cao

402
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,480
General Cao left the city to handle things

403
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,750
Don't know when he's back.

404
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Tell General Cao, Guan Yu say goodbye!

405
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,750
He wants to go, let him go

406
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,340
Sir, that is not very wise

407
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,450
I've made a promise to him before

408
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,540
Now that the battle stage is set

409
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,240
But that's the exact reason

410
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,320
We have to discuss carefully

411
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,960
How to handle the Yuan Shao situation

412
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,890
Now, Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao's Camp

413
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,440
If we let Guan Yunchang go, that’s like letting a tiger grow wings

414
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,390
The advisor is right sir

415
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,380
Guan Yu knows we poisoned him

416
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,780
For sure he is upset with us

417
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,670
I already said it

418
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,340
If he wants to leave let him leave

419
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,120
You all hear me clearly?

420
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,410
You said that

421
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,820
One of Yuan Shao's General wants to defect?

422
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,880
General Trương is smart and brave,

423
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,900
But is not seen as important, so he defected to us

424
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,160
Not seen as important then you defect?

425
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,340
Don't know what's the guy thinking

426
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,010
You recommended him, you take care of it

427
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,040
Thank you sir

428
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,210
Yuan Shao is about to invade

429
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,010
Sun Quan from Jiangdong will take advantage of this

430
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,330
What must we do?

431
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,720
Select 5000 to invade Jiangdong

432
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,630
Send 39 assassins to eliminate Gen. Tôn Gia

433
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,960
Then proceed as you said

434
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,580
Sister

435
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,620
Hello!

436
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,170
We can head out

437
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,500
Thank you for your gifts Brother Guan

438
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,290
Thank you big brother Guan

439
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,870
Stand up...

440
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,960
Everyone stand up

441
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,570
Everyone stand up

442
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,280
Everything here is from General Cao

443
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,970
If you wanna thank someone

444
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,160
Thank Sir Cao

445
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,750
Sir Guan, we were just there

446
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,850
General Cao is done with our residence permit

447
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,020
It's all done

448
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,950
That's good

449
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,960
Big brother Guan, bring this with you on the trip

450
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,510
Keep it to take care of your dad

451
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,900
Remember to listen to your mom! Be good!

452
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,190
Everyone take care of yourself!

453
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,960
Brother Guan...

454
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,220
Let us go sister-in-law

455
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:26,670
- Take care

456
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,710
Wait...go go....

457
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,560
Look, it's still fresh

458
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,710
- No thank you.
- Just take it

459
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,940
I don't really need it

460
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,230
How much for these?

461
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,540
This?

462
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,820
Exit the carriage

463
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,240
Travel papers?

464
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,690
I am Guan Yu

465
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,280
How can I believe that

466
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,750
just because you say it?

467
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,130
2nd brother...

468
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,670
General, everything okay?

469
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,600
The lady must get out also

470
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,510
She has to get out too?

471
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,790
Please don’t make it hard for me

472
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:23,769


473
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,780
Sorry to bother sister

474
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,980
Kong Xiu of Dongling,
by his highness order, To capture Guan Yu

475
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,660
2nd brother...

476
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,660
2nd brother...

477
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,950
2nd brother...

478
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,170
2nd brother...

479
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,070
2nd brother...

480
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,600
2nd brother...

481
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:15,870
Hurry!

482
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,800
Cao Cao made me a promise

483
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,810
If Guan Yu wants to leave

484
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,390
Then you must let me pass

485
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,310
That's between you and General Cao

486
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,050
I'm just following orders

487
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,190
Is it Cao Cao or someone else

488
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,850
That wants me dead?

489
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,810
Order to Kill came from the King

490
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,400
Why must you kill I, Guan Yu?

491
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,420
Can't object the king's order

492
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,890
Looks like things calmed down

493
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,240
We'll head North tomorrow

494
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,380
I won't bother you further.

495
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,580
2nd brother,

496
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,060
What happened today

497
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,050
No one wants that to happen.

498
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,790
I should only kill on the battlefield

499
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,410
Seeing how determined he was, you had to do it

500
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,500
I know you have moral and values

501
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,590
But the heaven gave you this gift of martial arts

502
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,250
To let you restore order, fight off evil

503
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,900
Guan Yu is just a normal martial artist, not deserving like you said

504
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,760
Sister-in-law

505
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,070
Keep this knife

506
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,830
In case of dangers

507
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,210
But you saved my many times

508
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,410
Times I've killed is even more

509
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,020
It's almost dawn, lets go to we can make it

510
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,040
Careful sister, stay close to me

511
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:58,700
Han Fu

512
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,590
Still remember me?

513
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,430
Big Brother Guan

514
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,810
How are you now?

515
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,630
This is the wife of Liu Bei

516
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,110
Sir Guan, how are things?

517
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,400
Can't be compared to how you're doing

518
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,360
I think all the subordinates here

519
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,700
All of them are your brothers

520
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,780
It's all because of Dong Zhuo

521
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,630
I'm like this after he started that fire

522
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,390
How's your situation?

523
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,060
No matter how hard I try, it's not like before

524
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,290
Such a shame!

525
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,300
Everyone knows,

526
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,750
weapons from your family are the best

527
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,980
May be they were too good,

528
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,850
Causing my family to be like this

529
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,110
If it weren't for brother Guan's help

530
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,640
Then it's not only an arm that I'm missing.

531
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,630
Chaotic times, nobody can predict the future.

532
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,920
To be honest.

533
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,530
I want to return to Brother Liu Bei

534
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,330
Why don't you and other brothers

535
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,460
follow big brother Liu as well

536
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,610
I won't go.

537
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,940
I've followed the 2 general for 10 odd years

538
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,840
Also, I'm not as daring to kill anymore

539
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,950
Then I wont force you

540
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,520
Today, I'm came with a favor

541
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,980
Hoping you could lend us a boat to escort sister back.

542
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,420
Brother Guan, why must we keep fighting?

543
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,070
Haven't this country got enough deaths?

544
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,250
Back in the day we fought

545
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,310
Only wanting to seek peace

546
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:56,970
Every since General Cao ruled till now

547
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:58,990
Things have been good.

548
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,540
You can even call it peaceful

549
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,330
You are now under Cao Cao?

550
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,400
I've just a normal person

551
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,320
General Cao only wants me,

552
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,040
To live righteously

553
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,160
Can you let me go just for today?

554
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,500
Brother Guan

555
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,210
I'm no match for you

556
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,710
But orders are orders

557
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,920
Brother Guan,

558
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,170
Why didn't you dodge it?

559
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,400
You know it's poisoned

560
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,650
Because we are brothers

561
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,250
You are not my opponent little brother

562
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,760
So I allow you one move

563
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,090
This move,

564
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,430
Ends our ties!

565
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,920
Why won't you fight back?

566
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,900
Because we are brothers

567
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,580
How can I kill you with my own hands?

568
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,880
Meng Tan...

569
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,810
Big brother...

570
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,080
I will kill him...

571
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:36,210
Kill him....

572
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,780
2nd brother...

573
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,980
Run!

574
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,390
Hurry!

575
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,340
After them!

576
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,820
2nd brother...

577
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,590
2nd brother...

578
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,170
2nd brother...

579
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,740
Sister

580
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,920
Sister-in-law

581
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,640
It's alright now.

582
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:09,170
I will kill you with this sword

583
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,280
To revenge my brother

584
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,470
There's no pity in my death

585
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,070
Let my sister go...

586
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,160
2nd brother...

587
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,510
2nd brother...

588
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,740
Who are you?

589
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,570
Everyday you come to visit me?

590
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,190
Who are you?

591
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:06,530
General

592
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,860
Who are you?

593
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,060
General..

594
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,930
General's awake

595
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,580
I'm a monk here at the temple

596
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:57,670
Buddhist name is Pu Jing.

597
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,600
Thank you for saving me

598
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:03,460
Please sit!

599
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,610
I've only help with the medicine

600
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,170
These past days,

601
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,480
Lady Qi Lan took care of you

602
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,190
Praying for you day and night

603
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,270
Pray that Buddha would look over you

604
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,910
That's debt

605
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,670
Your poison has soaked into your bones

606
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,330
Sorry that I'm incapable

607
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,680
I can only cure the outside.

608
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,840
Later on with cold days and rainy nights,

609
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,350
You will be in deep pain

610
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,100
Just being alive is good

611
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,150
Live you must, live righteously

612
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,130
One thing tho... don’t live in suffering and pain

613
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,060
I, Guan, don’t have the smarts

614
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,500
Only know to seek pain and suffering

615
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,070
Not quite.

616
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:57,090
Sufferings sometimes seeks us

617
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,610
But that's OK

618
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,160
Where's General Guan

619
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:32,590
He asked me to escort you to General Liu

620
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,340
Where did 2nd brother go?

621
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,050
He did not say

622
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,270
The general only asked the way to head North.

623
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:46,390
I think...he wants too

624
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,360
Divert the trailing enemy North

625
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:53,060
So that you'll make it back safely

626
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:46,440
You are Guan Yu?

627
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,450
And you are Bian Xi, the one that killed 5000 innocents in Peng Chau?

628
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:55,200
It's 5000 rebels

629
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:59,250
There's no pity in their deaths.

630
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:03,120
I've heard you were a rebel once.

631
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,000
Had to do it, when you don't have anything to eat

632
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:10,360
But even so you won't have anything to eat

633
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,350
You see how good I eat now?

634
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,070
You must right your wrongs

635
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,790
You're just like me

636
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,800
- Not the same

637
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,900
I don't kill to make a living

638
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,350
Wrong!

639
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,650
You're just like me!

640
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:29,830
Kill!!!!

641
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:33,140
Kill!!!!

642
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:23,500
Yuan Shao's 10000 men arrived at Guandu

643
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,670
Hundreds of ships on the rive

644
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,800
They're boasting , making noise

645
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:32,730
Looks like an all attacked, lion praying on rabbits

646
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:36,650
This Yuan Shao is barbaric, wanna be a lion?

647
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,680
Divide up into small formations and ambush him

648
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:42,950
Even the mightiest lion can't handle that

649
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,530
Where is Liu Bei troops?

650
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,050
Ruyang, only 1000 men

651
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,870
Liu Bei's at Ruyang, why's Guan Yu heading North?

652
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:03,000


653
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,050
Bian Xi of Sishui,

654
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:08,470
All died under Guan Yunchang's blade

655
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,750
Can you guys tell me why?

656
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,390
The four generals acted on orders to kill traitor Guan Yu

657
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,320
Orders? Following whose orders?

658
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:24,660
I gave an order, but that's to let him go.

659
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:29,310
You guys don't understand, or want to object.

660
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:37,050
My Lord, I gave the order.

661
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,600
I gave the order...

662
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,150
Why is everyone bowing?

663
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:01,440
Perhaps they wanna betray me

664
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,600
Sir, Tuần Do didn’t meant to object your order

665
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,540
But Guan Yunchang is too powerful. Can't release the tiger back to its jungle

666
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,210
You're bowing too, you wanna betray me too?

667
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:14,170
Sir, the battle's about to be fought. Please

668
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,590
Only kill I, Tuần Do.

669
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,510
Only have to kill you right, right?

670
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,600
Sir, his general crime doesn’t deserve death

671
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:32,770
Better have others let you down, don’t let down others

672
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,070
It was you that said so

673
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:40,460
What did I say?

674
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:46,180
Better have others let you down, don’t let down others

675
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,870
Right, I did say that

676
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,500
Stand up!

677
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,160
You guys are right, I'm wrong

678
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:26,690
Guan Yu said there's no love here, he's right

679
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,020
He's so right

680
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,170
Give me your hand!

681
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:50,230
Can't control my men.
How can you control a nation?

682
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:54,400
Can't be control cause there's love here

683
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,080
Please, where's the court house?

684
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:01,060
The court's closed

685
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:04,140
I heard that the official here is a greedy official

686
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,670
Even done things against the law

687
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:10,300
He drove away almost all the citizens in this city

688
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,700
You're mistaken

689
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,240
Because there's trouble here,

690
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,610
That’s why they left

691
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:30,330
I want to find that official, not you

692
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,010
It's the same thing

693
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,280
What’s the relationship between you and him?

694
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,250
I was his 'Vice Official'

695
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,490
But last month I chopped him dead

696
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,200
With his highness kindness,

697
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:44,890
I, Wang Zhi, is now the official of Xingyang

698
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,700
You're the one drove the citizens away

699
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,900
Allow me to ask, on your way here, killing men and generals

700
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:53,740
Causing chaos, causing citizens trouble

701
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,120
Wang Zhi is here to stop you

702
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,300
Cause I don't know anyone else to suffer

703
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:01,920
You're a good official

704
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,780
Never mind it!

705
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,380
Sword skill is not bad!

706
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,120
Sword skill's mediocre, it's the sword

707
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,980
The sword is good, but your will is not strong

708
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:04,660
I know!

709
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,840
Forget it! You're tired!

710
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,820
I'm not tired!

711
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:44,510
Continue to fight and you'll lose your life, still wanna fight?

712
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:49,310
Delaying you even just a little bit further

713
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,210
Worth it.

714
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:54,260
You believe that I, Guan Yu, would hurt the innocents?

715
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,960
These days, can't never tell

716
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,570
Cao Cao said he'd let me go

717
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:01,650
Then order to kill me

718
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,860
Who's the unpredictable one?

719
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:06,600
The law's been laid down

720
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:10,590
If this Guan did wrongs, I will accepts my punishment

721
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:12,800
Wang Zhi,

722
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,940
Let me finish this task,

723
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,140
I'll return to Xingyang

724
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,540
And take your punishment

725
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,980
You don't have to return cause your task won't be completed

726
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:36,410
The other day, a monk and a lady...

727
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,140
going toward Ruyang...

728
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:42,040
I myself lead them to Nam Dương road

729
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,770
invited them to Xingyang

730
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:45,880
Where's that lady?

731
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:51,240
I've used swallow bird to report their location

732
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:55,590
Go to Xu Du and surrender

733
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,230
Must hurry!

734
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,710
If not

735
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,120
They will starve to death

736
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,490
Where?

737
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,610
Tell me, else I won't have mercy

738
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,400
No need!

739
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:45,850
It's your fault

740
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,940
Lets go back

741
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:37,920
I am Guan Yu

742
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:41,040
Looking for a lady with several monks

743
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,190
Have you seen them?

744
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,060
He killed General Wang

745
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,230
He killed General Wang

746
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,490
Let me kid go!

747
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,040
Let me kid go!

748
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,820
- Devil...
- It's him...

749
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,480
Let's kill him....

750
01:19:55,610 --> 01:20:00,610
Kill him to revenge General Wang

751
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,290
Kill him...

752
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:09,430
Kill him to revenge General Wang....

753
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:18,570
Kill him...

754
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,140
Wang Zhi doesn’t kill innocents

755
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:51,420
We've found Lady Qi Lan outside the city

756
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:54,110
Alright, we can go

757
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:13,410
Open the gate!

758
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,770
Stop...

759
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,250
Can't kill them

760
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,010
They're all Wang Zhi's people

761
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,920
No matter how much I ask they won't say

762
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,530
the location of Lady Qi Lan

763
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:30,070
Only when General Cao arrived, they said it

764
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:33,590
These people must die.

765
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,120
General Guan,

766
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:37,890
We can  let them live

767
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,390
But if this gets out

768
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,760
the lord would have a bad rep

769
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:46,540
A bad rep for thousands of years

770
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,130
Whoever dares I'll kill that person

771
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,480
Looks like you can't become a hero

772
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,370
Just give up

773
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,750
I said Whoever dares I'll kill that person

774
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,660
Alright, General Guan doesn't want to kill

775
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:05,600
Then let them go

776
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:13,610
Everyone, if what happened today gets out

777
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,290
There's only one word

778
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:20,350
Kill!

779
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,440
Up to you

780
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,440
Brother Yunchang

781
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,350
You keep being the hero.

782
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,490
Bad guy? Let me

783
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,490
Luoyang was a hell hole

784
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:54,820
But they saw daylight

785
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,840
Your deed was too big to be measure

786
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:02,520
Unfortunately, outside of Luoyang is still hell hole

787
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:07,450
But the hell that you speak of, is only a way to look at things

788
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:10,320
Heaven or hell

789
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,290
Is all up oneself

790
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,360
I wish I can build a heaven

791
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,930
But perhaps it's not my time

792
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:23,670
Frankly, if thinking too far about anything

793
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:27,300
Is like creating hell for yourself

794
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:35,770
Wants me to think simple and not far ahead. That’s hard!

795
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:40,620
There's heaven within hell and vice versa

796
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:44,420
Please rethink carefully and then decide

797
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,930
Then I'll rethink about it

798
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,350
The horses are fed. Thank you sir

799
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,450
I wish to say goodbye

800
01:24:58,270 --> 01:25:00,200
Thank you for pointing things out to me

801
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:02,980
Thank you

802
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,020
Good bye!

803
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,240
Sit

804
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:31,130
To you, am I heaven or hell?

805
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:35,980
Heaven or hell all comes from what you think

806
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,590
Back then, when you wanted to keep me

807
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:41,010
You only need me to kill for you

808
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:44,280
How much must I kill for you?

809
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,740
Guan Yu is a hero.

810
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:51,570
Are there any heroes that doesn't kill in chaotic times like this

811
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:53,530
How much must I kill?

812
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:59,070
Yuan Shao has 20 thousands troop, kill 2 thousand

813
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,370
Then he will lose

814
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:03,500
What about after Yuan Shao is defeated?

815
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,960
How would run put order to the world?

816
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,700
Put Ru Ngủ Tôn at Giang Đông.

817
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,710
Tây Lương troops will watch the seas

818
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:13,910
Then what

819
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,090
After that..

820
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:19,560
Unify the whole country, take a few years off.

821
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,420
I think...the world would be in peace

822
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,140
Are you sure about that?

823
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,650
Can't be.

824
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,880
Human values are not enough

825
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:30,530
You need laws

826
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:31,990
But human to human,

827
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:35,200
If there's no moral terms, where's can you find laws?

828
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,310
In this world hatred keeps piling, where’s principle in that?

829
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:40,780
Killing Yuan Shao's 2000 men,

830
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:43,010
Isn't that piling up hatred?

831
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,960
That's the small price that must be pay

832
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,500
What if Guan Yu can kill Yuan Shao

833
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,350
Great, that way,

834
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,590
You saved 2000 people

835
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:01,030
Let me know, where is Yuan Shao?

836
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:02,030
So you will help?

837
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,000
I can't promise

838
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:07,540
After Yuan Shao's killed, I want to live normally

839
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:12,010
I don't believe you

840
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,370
A hero can never live a normal life

841
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:18,410
After it's done, Liu Bei will not forgive you

842
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:22,580
You stay and come back to Xu Du with me.

843
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,180
Brother Liu can see through things, he's just.

844
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,510
If it's must be, then he won't force it

845
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:31,890
If we're talking

846
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,400
bout me staying here, Guan Yu cannot comply

847
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:39,440
I'll rather go home to tend stocks and grow crops

848
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,040
So?

849
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:48,500
Okay, I'll promise you.

850
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:56,860
Sir, Guan Yu's really staying?

851
01:27:57,170 --> 01:28:01,130
You know why good horses doesn't eat re-grown grass?

852
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,370
Re-grown grass's not as fresh

853
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:08,100
right

854
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,280
Liu Bei's time is up

855
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:13,190
I, Cao Cao

856
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:16,170
is still on my way up!

857
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,580
Sister!

858
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,990
Ahead is Huang He River (Yellow River)

859
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:35,420
Guan Yu wish to withdraw

860
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:45,770
2nd brother...

861
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:47,030
Sister...

862
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:48,130
2nd brother....

863
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,910
Thousand steps of goodbye, yet we still must part

864
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:56,080
When you were hallucinating, I wasn't

865
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,820
How you feel...

866
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,120
I, Qi Lan knows

867
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,780
When I reach Ruyang, I'll ask brother Liu

868
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,510
to be married to you

869
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:11,010
Nonsense!

870
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,800
Sister, you're of Liu household, how can you say that?

871
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,910
Today, I, Qi Lan,  willingly wants to marry Guan Yu

872
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:21,040
You risked your life for Qi Lan on this journey

873
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:23,290
Qi Lan seen it clearly

874
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,340
Back then, you had to murder for me, why didn't you let me know?

875
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:33,410
Is it

876
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,160
because you never loved me?

877
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,310
If you do have feelings for me

878
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,190
Liu Brother would give us his blessing

879
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,310
- Come back with me.
- What if I don't go back?

880
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,610
Would you still love me?

881
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,180
Goodbye!

882
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,490
You cannot work for Cao Cao

883
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:26,520
Put it down!

884
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,440
You betray Liu Brother

885
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,180
just because one girl doesn't love you?

886
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:31,360
Guan Yu never thought of that

887
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:33,780
Only when Brother Liu's on the throne, the country can be united

888
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:36,510
If Cao Cao's in control, there'd be more chaos

889
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:41,050
I only want to good deeds for the people

890
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:09,570
Must I, Guan Yu, be dead?

891
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:20,150
Looks like Guan Yu have to die!

892
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,240
Sister, please tell Big Brother Liu,

893
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,770
Guan Yu is dead.

894
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,470
I'm sorry

895
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,570
You have no fault in this

896
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,180
Worry not sister-in-law

897
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,760
Guan Yu will never wrong brother Liu

898
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:00,610
Take care!

899
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,160
Sir, want me to go check on things?

900
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:13,610
Let it be, heroes cannot get past beauty

901
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,460
No rush!

902
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:26,410
Protect the lord

903
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:19,020
Who ordered you?

904
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,240
Who?

905
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:23,590
Chop him!

906
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:36,080
Where are they?

907
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,640
It was my order!

908
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:12,930
Letting Guan Yunchang go back...

909
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,950
The world will be in turmoil

910
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:35,400
You think I dare not kill him?

911
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,720
Then you be sure to kill him

912
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,110
If not from today on

913
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:54,250
The world will surely be in turmoil

914
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:56,900
Okay!

915
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:59,480
I’ll be sure to kill him

916
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,610
Your highness, lets go

917
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,310
You can't leave

918
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:47,960
You must have to kill Guan Yu?

919
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,260
Can't object the king

920
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,260
Can't object the king?

921
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:57,280
Can't object the king?

922
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:59,690
You no longer wish to live?

923
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:02,950
My life's been lost a long time ago

924
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:07,660
You're the same

925
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:30,530
Brother Guan, don't force me

926
01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:34,690
Get lost! I'll kill whoever's in my way

927
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,840
I'll chop whoever touches Guan Yunchang

928
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,400
Brother Yunchang, don't fight anymore

929
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:43,930
This scoundrel is not worth it

930
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,810
Can't object the king? I despise it

931
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,730
I'll chop you dead

932
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:49,110
Stop!

933
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:52,440
I am of the heaven's, you can't kill me

934
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,210
You're of the heaven's? I'll bring justice in the name of heaven

935
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:55,910
Guan Yunchang

936
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,230
The king cannot be killed

937
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,730
If the king is dead

938
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:03,980
Everyone'll have a reason to rebel

939
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,700
Then even more will die

940
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,190
Do you not understand this?

941
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,160
Because of a woman,

942
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:11,810
A woman that doesn't love you,

943
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,700
You turn your back on the world?

944
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,130
She is your sister-in-law

945
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:18,610
Another man's lady

946
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,840
There's nothing for you, even if she's alive

947
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:28,660
I promise, when the country's at peace

948
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,350
I myself will kill this scoundrel

949
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:39,420
I, Cao Mengde, said it and will do it

950
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:04,950
Cao Cao

951
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:08,170
This kingdom...

952
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,780
You cannot bring it to peace

953
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,090
Sister...

954
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:20,860
Let us go.

955
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,820
Today I want the world to know

956
01:41:57,030 --> 01:42:02,030
It was the other wolves that killed Guan Yu

957
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:10,550
You're speaking of Sun Quan?

958
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:14,740
Sun Quan, is just one

959
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:20,010
There's Liu Bei...Kong Ming also...

960
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,810
I want the world to know,

961
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:26,790
It's them that killed Guan Yu

962
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:35,290
Looks like war is inevitable

963
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:38,690
Of course, with Guan Yu gone.

964
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:43,110
Shu - Wu, who wins who loses

965
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:45,700
Cannot be said yet

966
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:48,010
Even when someone's dead

967
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,060
Sir Cao can still uses him

968
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:03,430
I never said I was a sheep!
