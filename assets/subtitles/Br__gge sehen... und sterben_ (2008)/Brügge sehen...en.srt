00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,772
I hope your midget
doesnt kill himself Your
dream sequence will be fucked

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,971
He doesnt like
being called a midget
He prefers dwarf

177
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,450
Well, this is
exactly my point!

178
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,647
People go around calling
you a midget when you
want to be called a dwarf

179
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:19,554
Of course youre
gonna blow your head off!

180
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:24,023
My names Ray Whats yours?
Chloe

181
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,192
How did you get past
the security man?

182
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,600
Getting past security men,
its sort of my job

183
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:32,636
Youre a shoplifter?

184
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,764
(CHUCKLES) No,
not a shoplifter

185
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,807
Its a good joke, though

186
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:38,936
No

187
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:42,509
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night

188
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,980
(CHUCKLING)

189
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,890
Fuck

190
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,708
How fucking cool

191
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,587
Mr. Blakely?

192
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,356
Yes No, Mr. Cranham
No Yes Mr. Blakely Yes

193
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,130
You have a message

194
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,499
Shit!

195
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,572
HARRY: Number one,
why arent you in when
I fucking told you to be in?

196
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:49,773
Number two, why doesnt
this hotel have phones
with fucking voicemail

197
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:52,611
and not I have to leave
messages with the
fucking receptionist?

198
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,586
Number three, you better
fucking be in tomorrow night
when I fucking call again

199
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:59,783

200
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,610
(DOOR LOCK TURNING)

201
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,529
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

202
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,121
Sorry, Ken

203
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,326
Keep the fucking
noise down!

204
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,268
Someones in a mood

205
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,812
(SOFTLY) Youll
never guess what

206
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,981
Will you shut your
fucking mouth, please,
and go to sleep?

207
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,719
Oh, sorry

208
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:15,222
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out

209
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,807
Altogether,

210
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,343
I had

211
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,578
five pints of beer
and six bottles

212
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:35,382
No Six pints of beer
and seven bottles

213
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:38,082
And you know what?
Im not even pissed!

214
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,191
Youll never guess what, Ken

215
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,992
Ken, youll never guess what
What?

216
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,194
Got a date for
tomorrow night

217
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:52,362
Im very happy for you

218
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,564
With a girl

219
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:54,901
Can you turn
the light off, please?

220
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,874
Only been in Bruges one day,
got a date with a girl
in the film business,

221
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:00,001
the Belgian film business

222
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,805
Theyre doing a film
about a midget

223
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,292
Miss?

224
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:25,296
Marie?

225
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,977
Sorry about the message
last night The man who
left it is a bit of a

226
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:36,436
Well, hes a bit of a

227
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:38,141
Cock?

228
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,343
Yes Hes a bit of a cock

229
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,851
Morning

230
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,125
Harry called last night

231
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,292
We missed him

232
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:04,575
Jeez, he swears a lot,
doesnt he?

233
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,836
Were staying in tonight
Whatever happens

234
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,642
Hmm

235
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,315
Except

236
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,184
Hmm
Hmm

237
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:18,948
Except hmm what?

238
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:23,790
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really

239
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,089
Uh-huh

240
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,326
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

241
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,834
I thought you
didnt like Bruges

242
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,700
I dont like Bruges,
its a shithole

243
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,570
But I did already say
I had a date with
a Belgian lady

244
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,702
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already
say about before

245
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,913
Just dont get into
any fucking trouble

246
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,113
Were keeping a low profile

247
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:54,452
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

248
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,892
we are doing
what I want to do

249
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,724
Got it?
Of course

250
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,498
Which, I presume,
will involve culture

251
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,298
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun

252
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,932
Somehow I believe, Ken,
that the balance shall tip
in the favor of culture

253
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:14,810
Like a big, fat,
fucking retarded,
fucking black girl

254
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,576
on a seesaw, opposite

255
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,582
a dwarf

256
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,108
(DRAGGING FEET)

257
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:01,250
(SOFTLY) Ray, did we
or did we not agree

258
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,816
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

259
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,862
wed do the things
I wanted to do today?

260
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,795
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today

261
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,424
And that wed do them
without you throwing
a fucking moody,

262
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,866
like some 5-year-old
whos dropped
all his sweets?

263
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,904
I didnt agree to that

264
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:16,866
Ill cheer up
Ill cheer up

265
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,244
Up there,
the top altar,
is a phial

266
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:24,505
brought back by
a Flemish knight from the
Crusades in the Holy Land

267
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,176
And that phial,
do you know what
its said to contain?

268
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,809
No, whats it
said to contain?

269
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:32,846
Its said to contain
some drops of
Jesus Christs blood

270
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:36,654
Yeah, thats how
this church got its name
Basilica of the Holy Blood

271
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,093
Yeah Yeah

272
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,029
And this blood, right,
though its dried blood,

273
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,193
at different times
over many years, they say
it turned back into liquid

274
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,932
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood

275
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,133
At various times of great

276
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:52,971
stress

277
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,342
Yeah?
Yeah

278
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:59,509
So, yeah, Im gonna go up
in the queue and touch it,
which is what you do

279
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,744
Yeah?
Yeah You coming?

280
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,278
Do I have to?

281
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,759
Do you have to?
Of course you
dont have to

282
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:12,694
Its Jesus fucking blood,
isnt it? Of course you
dont fucking have to!

283
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:15,288
Of course you dont
fucking have to!

284
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,201
You little fucking cunt

285
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:05,078
(SIGHS)

286
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,137
RAY: Murder, Father

287
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,813
PRIEST: Why did you
murder someone, Raymond?

288
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,444
For money, Father

289
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,220
For money?

290
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:48,258
You murdered
someone for money?

291
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,315
Yes, Father

292
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,659
Not out of anger,
not out of nothing
For money

293
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,621
(CLEARS THROAT)

294
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,926
Who did you murder
for money, Raymond?

295
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,102
You, Father

296
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:03,334
Im sorry?

297
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:06,104
I said you, Father
What, are you deaf?

298
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,512
Harry Waters says hello

299
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,394
The little boy

300
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:16,097
RAY: I quite like this one

301
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:20,440
All the rest were
rubbish by spastics,
but this ones quite good

302
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:22,537
Whats that
all about, then?

303
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:27,545
Its Judgment Day,
you know?
Oh, yeah

304
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,079
Whats that then?

305
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:36,251
Well, its, you know,
the final day on Earth

306
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:42,022
When mankind will be
judged for all the crimes
theyve committed and that

307
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,038
And see who gets
into Heaven and who gets
into Hell and all that?

308
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,163
Yeah

309
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,036
And whats the other place?

310
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:51,336
Purgatory

311
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,673
Purgatory?

312
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:56,838
Purgatorys kind of like
the in-betweeny one

313
00:26:56,914 --> 00:27:00,907
You werent really shit,
but you werent
all that great, either

314
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,076
Like Tottenham

315
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,490
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

316
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,048
About Tottenham?

317
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,491
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife

318
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:16,457
Guilt and sins and

319
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,732
Hell and all that?

320
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:24,396
Um

321
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:28,800
Well

322
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,480
KEN: I dont know, Ray
I dont know what I believe

323
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:42,315
The things youre
taught as a child, they never
really leave you, do they?

324
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,657
So, like,
I believe in trying
to lead a good life

325
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,392
Like, if theres an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

326
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:52,197
I dont try and help her
carry her shopping,
I dont go that far,

327
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:56,468
but Ill certainly hold the
door open for her and that,
and let her go out before me

328
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,667
Yeah And anyway,
if you tried to help her
carry her shopping,

329
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:00,676
shed probably think
you were just trying
to nick her shopping

330
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:03,577
Exactly
This is the world
we live in today

331
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:06,980
At the same time
as trying to lead
a good life,

332
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,686
I have to reconcile myself
with the fact that, yes,
I have killed people

333
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:17,184
Not many people
Most of them were
not very nice people

334
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,890
Apart from one person

335
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,363
Whos that?

336
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,866
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother

337
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:27,393
He was just trying
to protect his brother
Like you or I would

338
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:29,769
He was just a lollipop man

339
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,298
He came at me with a bottle
What are you gonna do?

340
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:34,777
I shot him down

341
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:35,835
Hmm

342
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,347
In my book, though,
sorry, someone comes
at you with a bottle,

343
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,978
that is a deadly weapon,
hes gotta take
the consequences

344
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,452
I know that in my heart

345
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:46,819
I also know that he was
just trying to protect
his brother, you know?

thatd be different

have been fair

Well, technically,
your bare hands
can kill somebody, too

to kill a little boy

I made and the course

00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,235
Its like a fairytale,
isnt it, that place?
Yeah

517
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,244
With the churches and that
Theyre Gothic
Yeah

518
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:42,869
Is it Gothic?
Yeah

519
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,507
So hes having
a really nice time?

520
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,416
Well, Im having
a really nice time

521
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:51,250
Im not sure if its
really his cup of tea

522
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,117
What?

523
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,617
You know, Im not sure
if its really his thing

524
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,322
What do you mean,
Its not really his thing?

525
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:01,523
Whats that supposed to mean,
Its not really his thing?

526
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,929
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

527
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,023
Nothing, Harry

528
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,193
Its a fairytale
fucking town, isnt it?

529
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:09,034
How can a fairytale town
not be somebodys
fucking thing?

530
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,233
How can all those canals
and bridges and cobbled
streets and those churches,

531
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,572
all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,

532
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,545
how can that not be
somebodys fucking thing, eh?

533
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,945
What I think
I meant to say was

534
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:19,811
Is the swan still there?
Yeah, the swans

535
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,012
How can fucking swans
not fucking be somebodys
fucking thing, eh?

536
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,213
How can that be?

537
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,414
What I think
I meant to say was,

538
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,652
when he first arrived,
he wasnt quite sure about it

539
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,719
You know, theres that big,
dual carriageway when you
get off the train?

540
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,061
It mightn't have been
here when you were
here last, Harry

541
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,101
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

542
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:42,036
and he saw the canals
and the bridges and,
you know, the swans and that,

543
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,039
well, he just
fucking loved it then

544
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,635
Couldnt get enough of it,
the medieval part of town

545
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:52,340
It was just that initial,
dual carriageway thing sort of
put him off for a second

546
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,110
Dont know if I remember
a dual carriageway

547
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:55,516
Must be recent

548
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,951
Hasnt spoilt it, has it?

549
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,286
No, no, no,
its just that
initial thing

550
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,454
And you know what?

551
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:07,822
As we were walking
through the streets,

552
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:13,063
there was this sort of
freezing fog hanging
over everything,

553
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:17,304
and it made it
look almost like
a fairytale or something

554
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:18,898
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

555
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,534
Whatd he say?

556
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,639
He said, Ken, I know
Im awake, but I feel
like Im in a dream

557
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:28,081
Yeah? He said that?

558
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,175
Yeah

559
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,813
Meaning, like,
in a good dream?

560
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,755
Yeah Of course,
like in a good dream

561
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:38,226
Oh, good Im glad
he likes it there

562
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,262
Im glad we were able
to give him something

563
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,164
Something good and happy
Because he wasnt
a bad kid, was he?

564
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,695
Huh?

565
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,336
He wasnt a bad kid,
was he?

566
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,467
Listen, take down
this address
Raamstraat 17

567
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:56,603
Thats Raam,  like Ram, 
but with an extra a

568
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,672
Raamstraat 17

569
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:00,340
You got that?

570
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:02,150
Yes, Raamstraat 17

571
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,451
Good Therell be a man
there tomorrow morning
at 9:00, his names Yuri

572
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,219
Yuri
He'll give you the gun

573
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,192
Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's

574
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,094
about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow,
after its done

575
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:15,724
After whats done?

576
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:18,195
Are you being thick?

577
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:21,599
No
Listen, I like Ray

578
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,072
He was a good bloke,
but when it all comes
down to it, you know,

579
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,235
he blew the head off
a little fucking kid
And you brought him in, Ken

580
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,768
So if the buck
dont stop with him,
where does it stop?

581
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:37,344
Ken?

582
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:40,887
If the buck
dont stop with him,
where does it stop?

583
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,949
It stops with me, Harry
Thats an easy one

584
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,153
Look, dont get shirty, Ken

585
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:51,000
Listen, Im just glad that
I was able to do something
for the boy before he went

586
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,695
Do what for the boy?

587
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:55,204
You know, have him
get to see Bruges

588
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,202
Id like to go to see
Bruges again before I die

589
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:03,503
What was it he said
again about Yeah,
Its like a dream

590
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,547
I know Im awake,
but I feel like
Im in a dream

591
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,112
Yeah

592
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,289
Give me a call
when hes dead

593
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:38,936
(GASPS)

594
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,784
Thats my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole

595
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:45,081
Eirik, what are you doing?

596
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,918
Where are you from, fucker?

597
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,458
Ireland, originally

598
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,523
And you think its okay
to come over to Belgium

599
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:53,358
and fuck another mans girl?

600
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:55,260
Look, I didnt know
she had a boyfriend,
all right?

601
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:58,300
And I havent fucked her,
anyway Ask her
Id only put me hand on it

602
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,336
Eirik, put the gun down!

603
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,972
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth

604
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,599
Dont start being silly

605
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:07,438
Get down on your

606
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:11,940
Exactly at what point
was it that all skinheads
suddenly became poofs?

607
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,175
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

608
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,514
you just went around
beating up
Pakistani 12-year-olds

609
00:44:15,585 --> 00:44:18,885
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

610
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:21,617
Thats not gonna
help you, man

611
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,456
Ray, theres only
blanks in that gun

612
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,831
Eirik, dont!

613
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,199
Now whos the
fucking bum-boy?

614
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,501
You, you fucking bum-boy!

615
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,605
(GROANING)

616
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:40,507
Chloe, what exactly
is going on here?

617
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,737
I cant see!
I cant see!

618
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,215
Of course you cant
fucking see! I just shot
a blank in your fucking eyes!

619
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:52,221
Is this fella your boyfriend?
No I mean, he used to be

620
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,449
Well, whats he doing here?

621
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:56,960
We We rob tourists,
sometimes

622
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,961
I fucking knew
it was too good
to be true!

623
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:02,092
I knew youd have never
shagged me, normally

624
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,396
No! Thats not true, I

625
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:07,835
I called it off tonight
I told him not
to come tonight

626
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,030
Why did you come tonight?

627
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,800
EIRIK: Chloe,
I cant see,
I swear it!

628
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:13,364
Stop whingeing
like a big gay baby

629
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:15,001
I havent had
a shag in months!

630
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:20,072
I cant see out of this eye,
Chloe! I have to go
to the hospital!

631
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,878
Ill drive you

632
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,715
Great! Now the whole
nights ruined!

633
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:25,048
No!

634
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:29,081
You can stay if you want
I just dont know
how long Ill be

635
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,025
I just knew someone like you
would never like
someone like me

636
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,860
I just knew
What do you mean,
someone like me?

637
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:36,900
You know, someone nice

638
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:46,764
Call me Please

639
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:53,311
EIRIK: Chloe!

640
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,278
Cha-ching!

641
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,414
(MUMBLES)

642
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:05,554
Have you got some
sort of problem?

643
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:07,590
No, no problem

644
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,387
Four beers
in 20 minutes
No problem

645
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,590
Fuck off

646
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,831
JIMMY: Beer and a red wine

647
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,373
Ill be back

648
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,742
Hows the movie going?

649
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:33,976
Its a jumped-up
Eurotrash piece of
rip-off fucking bullshit

650
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,985
Like, in a bad way?

651
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,184
Your girlfriends
very pretty

652
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:45,057
She aint my girlfriend
Shes a prostitute
I just picked up

653
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,621
Didnt know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges

654
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:52,099
You just have to look
in the right places

655
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:53,829
Brothels are good

656
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:58,364
Well, youve picked up
a very pretty prostitute

657
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,806
Thank you

658
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,043
You from the States?

659
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,010
Yeah

660
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,851
But dont hold it
against me

661
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,284
Ill try not to

662
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,849
Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass

663
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,943
Hey-ho Drowning
your sorrows, huh?

664
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:39,744
What sorrows?
You know, being a sad,
old, ugly little man

665
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:41,010
One gay beer, please

666
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,210
Howd your date go?

667
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,516
My date involved
two instances of
extreme violence

668
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,612
One instance of her hand
on my cock and my finger
up her thing,

669
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,590
which lasted all too briefly
Isnt that always the way?

670
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:53,061
One instance of me
stealing five grams of
her very-high-quality cocaine,

671
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,291
and one instance of me
blinding a poofy
little skinhead

672
00:48:55,364 --> 00:48:58,561
So, all in all,
my evening pretty much
balanced out fine

673
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,728
You got five grams of coke?

674
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,199
Ive got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

675
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,570
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

676
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:05,869
as if Im about to
have a heart attack

677
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,137
So if I collapse
any minute now, please
remember to tell the doctors

678
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,838
that it might have something
to do with the coke

679
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,346
Give us a gram, then

680
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,382
I thought you were
laying off, because
it makes you depressed?

681
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:16,851
You know what?
Right now, I dont

Why didnt you wave
hello to me today when
I waved hello to you today?

683
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,811
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today

684
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:55,789
I wasnt waving
hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse

685
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,693
Huh? What are you
talking about?

Yeah But dont
hold it against me

689
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:09,204
Well, thats for me
to decide, isnt it?

690
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,704
Are you from America, too?

691
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:12,297
No, Im from Amsterdam

(SCOFFS) Amsterdam

693
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,677
Amsterdam is just
a load of bloody
prostitutes, isnt it?

694
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:18,737
Yes Thats why
I came to Bruges

695
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:22,079
I thought Id get
a better price
for my pussy here

think about it?

Would you ever think about
killing yourself because
youre a midget?

that might be necessary

There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park

You use this word,
alcoves?

the right word, alcoves?

773
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:52,367
Alcoves, yes
Its kind of like
nooks and crannies

774
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:56,538
Nooks and crannies, yes
Perhaps this would be
more accurate

775

rather than alcoves Yeah

arent you? Mr. Waters
will be very disappointed

fucking do it

rather oddly this morning

Oddly? How?

Well, he asked me
about the baby, and if
I wanted a boy or a girl

782
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:43,556
I said I didnt mind
as long as its
healthy, of course

783
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,960
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby

784
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:54,369
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent

785
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,266
Would you give it
back to him when
you see him?

786
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,036
I dont want to appear
ungrateful, but it seemed
like all the money he had

787
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:08,106
Do you know where he is now?
He said he was
going to the park

Sorry, Ray

00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,344

refused to kill the boy,

youve even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,377
Not to mention
the other nationalities,
just on their holidays

1022
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,445
Hmm

1023
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:13,057
To see the swans
and the Gothic and all
the fairytale stuff, eh?

1024
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:16,494
Are you trying to
fucking wind me up?
No, Harry

1025
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:18,965
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts

1026
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:22,002
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here

1027
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:23,297
Christ!

1028
01:17:26,641 --> 01:17:28,701
Lets go up the bell tower

1029
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,972
Be quiet up there
this time of evening

1030
01:17:32,046 --> 01:17:33,707
Lets go up there

1031
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,128
Yeah Canadians

1032
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,134
I feel a bit bad
They didnt kill
John Lennon, did they?

1033
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,675
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days

1034
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:02,766
Are you going to turn up?

1035
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:03,868
Dont know

1036
01:18:03,944 --> 01:18:06,175
What have I got to
stay for really?

1037
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:11,244
The most beautiful woman

1038
01:18:12,953 --> 01:18:14,581
youve ever seen

1039
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:18,016
in all of your stupid life

1040
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,502
The tower is closed
this evening

1041
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:32,766
No way Its supposed
to be open till 7:00

1042
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:34,934
The tower is usually
open until 7:00

1043
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,739
Yesterday an American
had a heart attack
up the tower

1044
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,212
Today the tower is closed

1045
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,274
Here, cranky, heres
100 for you Were only
gonna be 20 minutes

1046
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:54,587

01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,295
Jimmy, Ive been
wanting to say

1051
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:41,637
Im really sorry for
karate-chopping you
the other night

1052
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,076
That was way out of order

1053
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:48,775
You know, Ray, Id find it
easier to believe and
forgive you, somehow,

1054
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:53,947
if the two of you werent
laughing straight
in my fucking face!

1057
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,655
It is a nice town, Harry

1058
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,292
Im glad I got to see it

1059
01:20:12,506 --> 01:20:16,636
I didnt mean to be
taking the piss out of it
being a fairytale place

1060
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,542
It is a fairytale place

1061
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,975
It really is
Hmm

1062
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,877
Its just a shame
its in Belgium, really

1063
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:26,318
But then you figure
if it wasnt in Belgium,
if it was somewhere good,

1064
01:20:26,387 --> 01:20:30,518
thered be too many people
coming to see it It would
spoil the whole thing

1065
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,291
Well, Im glad
I got to see it

1066
01:20:37,131 --> 01:20:38,622
before I died

1067
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,502
What are you doing?

1068
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,943
What are you
fucking doing?

1069
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,841
Im not fighting
anymore, Harry

1070
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:55,978
All right, then Im blowing
your fucking head off

1071
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,310
Dont come over all Gandhi
What are you fucking doing?

1072
01:21:03,324 --> 01:21:04,985
Ken, stop messing
about, please

1073
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,118
Pick up your gun
I know Im going
to beat you anyway

1074
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:09,823
cause youre a spaz, but
Harry,

1075
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:13,390
Im totally in your debt

1076
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:19,466
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

1077
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:21,971
I love you
unreservedly
for all that

1078

What?

1079
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:25,908
For your integrity

1080
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,439
For your honor

1081
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,750
I love you

1082
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,554
The boy had to be let go

1083
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,359
The boy had to be
given a chance

1084
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:46,323
And if to do that,
I had to say, Fuck you,
and fuck what I owe you,

1085
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:51,134
and fuck everything
thats gone on between us,
then thats what I had to do

1086
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:53,596
But lm not fighting you

1087
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,235
And I accept, totally,
everything youve got to do

1088
01:21:57,311 --> 01:21:59,143
I accept it Totally

1089
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,246
Oh, yeah?

1090
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:07,645
Yeah

1091
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:17,289
Well, you say all that
fucking stuff, I cant
fucking shoot you now, can I?

1092
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,158
Lts entirely
up to you, Harry

lts entirely your call

Oh, you fucking cunt!

1096
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:37,945
Look, lm not gonna
do nothing to you

1097
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:41,819
just cause youre
standing about like
Robert fucking Powell

turns out to just be

Boschian nightmare

Kiss my ass!

1104
01:22:56,270 --> 01:23:00,435
I guess at least there
werent any black people
involved, eh, Jimmy?

1105
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,074
I wasnt

1106
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:05,936
I wasnt talking about

1107
01:23:07,114 --> 01:23:10,140
Theres gonna be a war
between all the blacks
and all the whites

1108
01:23:10,217 --> 01:23:12,015
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

1109
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:14,247

be really good

the Vietnamese on his side!

down by the pointy

good for once

onto the canal, right?

1179
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:53,814

jump into the canal,

see if I can swim
to the other side
and escape

Right
If you go outside
and round the corner,

1182
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:00,725
you can shoot at me
from there and try
and get me

1183

That way, we leave this lady
and her baby out of
the whole, entire thing

Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1185
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,529
I dont want to
run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

1186
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,158
and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard

1187
01:35:09,235 --> 01:35:10,533
I completely promise, Harry

1188
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:12,935
lm not gonna risk
having another
little kid die, am I?

1189
01:35:13,006 --> 01:35:17,171
So, hang on, I go outside,
then I go which way,
right or left?

1190
01:35:17,243 --> 01:35:18,711
You go right,
dont you?

1191
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:21,770
You can see it
from the doorway!
Lts a big fucking canal!

1192
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:24,818
All right Jesus!
Lve only just
got here, havent I?

1193
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,717
Okay On a count of
one, two, three, go, okay?

1194
01:35:27,787 --> 01:35:28,948
Okay

1195
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:36,158
What? Who says it?

1196
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:37,628
Oh, you say it

1197
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:39,631
You guys are crazy

1198
01:35:39,699 --> 01:35:41,099
Are you ready?
Ready

1199
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:42,692
Set?
Set

1200
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,567
One, two, three, go!

1201
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,118
Keep driving!

1202
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,527
No way Youre way
too far away

1203
01:36:15,101 --> 01:36:16,932
(GROANING)

1204
01:38:12,252 --> 01:38:14,050
The little boy

1205
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:15,179
Thats right, Ray

1206
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:17,881
The little boy

1207
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:24,680
Oh

1208
01:39:26,926 --> 01:39:28,121
I see

1209
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:36,395
No, Harry

1210
01:39:37,404 --> 01:39:38,927
Hes not

1211
01:39:41,574 --> 01:39:44,203
Youve got to stick
to your principles

1212
01:40:10,604 --> 01:40:12,367
RAY: Theres a Christmas tree
somewhere in London

1213
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:16,341
with a bunch of presents
underneath it thatII
never be opened

1214
01:40:16,976 --> 01:40:20,970
And I thought,
If I survive all this,
lII go to that house,

1215
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:22,810
apologize to
the mother there,

1216
01:40:22,882 --> 01:40:26,319
and accept whatever
punishment she chose for me

1217
01:40:26,386 --> 01:40:29,753
Prison, death,
it didnt matter

1218
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:34,390
Because at least in prison
and at least in death,
you know,

1219
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:36,827
I wouldnt be
in fucking Bruges

1220
01:40:39,298 --> 01:40:43,359
But then, like a flash,
it came to me, and I realized,

1221
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:48,300
Fuck, man, maybe
thats what Hell is

1222
01:40:49,909 --> 01:40:53,208
The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!

1223
01:40:58,085 --> 01:41:00,917
And I really, really
hoped I wouldnt die

1224
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:06,118
I really, really
hoped I wouldnt die

1225
01:46:57,524 --> 01:46:58,118
}}
