1
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,726
Think about it.
Right on the beach,

2
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:22,394
ocean breezes, blue skies, seagulls.

3
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:26,065
- All yours for the taking.
- It's a timeshare.

4
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:29,355
Well, it's called a timeshare,

5
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,615
but the truth is,
for the two weeks you're at the condo,

6
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,444
you're not sharing anything.

7
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,237
You're not sharing the bathroom,
not sharing the toaster, nothing.

8
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,656
<i>Nada.</i> Zip.

9
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:45,080
You are the mistress of all you survey.

10
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:49,125
My nephew looked up the neighbourhood
on the computer.

11
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,421
Your nephew?

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,295
Mrs Darby.

13
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:59,091
He said the condo was
in a bad neighbourhood.

14
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:00,514
Blacks.

15
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:09,646
You're right. You're right.

16
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:13,237
The condo is in a rather
poor majority black neighbourhood.

17
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,693
And you know what?
I'm glad you brought it up.

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,743
Seriously.

19
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:23,741
Otherwise, I might have done something
that I'd be ashamed of later.

20
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:28,545
And that would be
to sell you that timeshare.

21
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,965
- You would not feel safe there.
- No, I wouldn't.

22
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:36,797
Of course you wouldn't.
How could you?

23
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,633
We all know,

24
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:43,269
and I say this at the risk
of sounding a little racist,

25
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,685
black dudes love white women.

26
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,809
Love 'em. I don't know
if it's genetic or if it's society.

27
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:55,820
We can argue nature versus nurture
all day, but it's a scientific fact

28
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:59,693
that black men can't get enough
of white women.

29
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:03,204
Don't think a woman of your age
would be safe from their advances.

30
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,917
No, ma'am.

31
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:08,500
These big black bucks
don't care whether you're young or old,

32
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,000
skinny or fat,

33
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:14,634
walking or with two wrinkled stumps
right below the knees.

34
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:18,670
They want your white flesh.
They want it bad.

35
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,928
Truth be told, I'm part black myself.

36
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:26,388
And if it wasn't for my wife,
I'd be bending you over the desk

37
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,308
doing you doggy-style right now.

38
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:34,521
I can just imagine you there,
all alone in that big condo,

39
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:38,232
awash in a sea of Negro cock.

40
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,319
I'll... I'll take it.

41
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,496
Smart move. Sign your Jane Hancock
on the dotted line.

42
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,582
- You can't go in there.
- Here you go.

43
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,076
- Stan Minton.
- I'll be with you in a second.

44
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,285
Go on. Sign it.

45
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:52,835
Stan Minton,
you're under arrest for fraud.

46
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,629
Anything you say will be
used against you in a court.

47
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:58,375
It's just a little mix-up.
Go on, sign it.

48
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,761
- You white Jezebel!
- I'll call Mal!

49
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:04,550
You're gonna regret this!
Call my attorney!

50
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:10,650
Madam Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

51
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:13,853
- We have, Your Honour.
- Please hand it to the bailiff.

52
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,734
Will the defendant please rise?

53
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,198
Madam Foreman,
how do you find the defendant?

54
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,320
We, the jury,
find the defendant guilty.

55
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,996
- What?
- Thank you, Madam Foreman.

56
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,743
- That bitch!
- Stanley, please, quiet.

57
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,923
Sentencing will be tomorrow at 10am.

58
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,553
- What the fuck just happened in there?
- You lost, Stanley.

59
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,214
I didn't lose.
You're the lawyer, you lost.

60
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,052
I'm truly sorry.

61
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,683
Damn it, man! I'm rich!

62
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,812
I wanted some of that O.J. justice.

63
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,939
Maybe the judge will give probation.

64
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,644
No. In this state, first-degree fraud

65
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,395
carries a minimum
of three to five years.

66
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,401
I got it!

67
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:04,328
- We bribe the judge.
- I'm not gonna bribe the judge.

68
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,572
- Bribe him.
- I'm not gonna bribe him.

69
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,242
- Bribe him!
- Oh, please.

70
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,076
- Bribe him!
- No!

71
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,921
I don't practise that kind of law,
and I never will.

72
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,376
You wanna bribe the judge?
Be my guest.

73
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:19,961
I'm sure any shyster on the street
will be happy to do it for you.

74
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,054
Mal? You're fired.

75
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,729
Mr Popper,
is your client ready for sentencing?

76
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,062
He is, Your Honour.

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,858
Anything you'd like to say
before the court passes sentence?

78
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,867
Your Honour, my client
has been convicted

79
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,328
of fraud in the first degree.

80
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,916
A crime of which he is innocent.

81
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:57,503
But even if he were guilty

82
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,425
and his customers were defrauded,

83
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:04,971
isn't it better that Mr Minton,
as a resident of Los Angeles,

84
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,674
receive the money,
thereby keeping it in the community,

85
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:12,552
as opposed to some gypsies
or travelling Mexicans,

86
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,858
who would have taken the money
out of the community?

87
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,572
Please take that into consideration.

88
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:28,447
Mr Minton, you are hereby sentenced to
serve a term of no less than three years

89
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:31,373
at the Verlaine State
Correctional Facility.

90
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,661
Normally, your sentence
would begin immediately.

91
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:39,664
However, I'm going to delay
your incarceration for six months

92
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:44,170
so that you may...
reorganise the charity

93
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:48,557
that you've established
to teach music to retarded children.

94
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:53,475
Thank you, judge.

95
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:55,886
Court is adjourned.

96
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:01,069
- Teach music to retarded children?
- It sounded good at the time.

97
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,444
- I thought you were gonna bribe him.
- I did.

98
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:06,319
Hundred grand in Krugerrand
doesn't go too far now.

99
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,236
- Did we win?
- No. I don't get it.

100
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,534
You bribe the judge
and I get three years?

101
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,745
Mandatory.
The judge couldn't fix that.

102
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,489
Now you got six months
to set your affairs in order.

103
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,328
My affairs are already in order.

104
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:23,962
My legal opinion is that you take
a Brazilian vacation. Permanently.

105
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,424
Sounds like fun.

106
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,174
I can't do that.

107
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:30,921
Those Krugerrands were the last
liquid asset I had.

108
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,223
The rest of my money
is frozen in the bank.

109
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,968
I'm not gonna run
and leave seven million behind.

110
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,184
Well, Stan,
my old man had a saying:

111
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,059
"You walk through a locker room,
you're gonna see some dick. "

112
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:48,610
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you rip off enough people,

113
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,777
eventually you're gonna go to jail.

114
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,745
Thanks, that's really comforting.

115
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:57,375
Hey, I'm a crooked lawyer.
I know I'm going to jail someday.

116
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:00,913
You don't see me crying about it.

117
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,595
Stan, slow down. You're gonna choke.

118
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:18,138
I gotta eat now.
I hear that prison food is real crap.

119
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:22,433
I'm real glad we have six months
together before you have to go to...

120
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,484
- You know.
- Tell me about it.

121
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:27,988
I could be in jail right now.
Popper's one hell of a lawyer.

122
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,322
I'm gonna be awfully lonely
while you're gone.

123
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:36,623
I know, sweetheart.
But I think I get conjugal visits.

124
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,792
I can probably stick it to you
once a month or so. Pretty good.

125
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,001
Oh, sure, that's great.

126
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,879
- But I was thinking...
- Mm-hm.

127
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:49,291
...maybe we could do something now
so I wouldn't be so lonely later.

128
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,262
Like what?

129
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:56,009
Like maybe we could make a baby.

130
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,689
Mindy, are you crazy?

131
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:03,015
- I just...
- I'm gonna be gone three years.

132
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:06,443
Five at the max. What are we gonna do
with the kid when I get out?

133
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:08,605
Give it up for adoption?
That's cruel.

134
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,818
I thought maybe we could keep it.

135
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,116
Mindy, how many times
have we gone over this?

136
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,659
It's selfish to bring
a child into this world.

137
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,666
A world full of suffering
and hunger and war.

138
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,586
- It's just... selfish!
- I know.

139
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:25,541
Plus, a kid would totally
cramp our lifestyle.

140
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:29,760
We couldn't go on vacation when we
wanted, they break stuff, they cry.

141
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:32,466
You'd get stretch marks.

142
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,308
That's right. Stretch marks.

143
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:36,589
Scary stuff, huh?

144
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:39,971
I just let you
walk all over me.

145
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,432
Oh, Mindy, come on.

146
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,897
OK, Mindy, you can get a dog.

147
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:48,986
After I leave!

148
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,064
Your other steak, sir.

149
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:25,350
- What do you want, doll?
- Put some Scotch in this.

150
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:31,028
- We got whiskey.
- Not as good, but it'll have to do.

151
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:35,065
All right. That'll be 75 cents.

152
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:37,824
Good deal.

153
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:43,078
- Keep the change.
- Ooh! Well...

154
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:47,086
Ah! Give me another one, honey.

155
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,680
Do you got a problem?

156
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:06,349
No. No, I...

157
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:10,522
I was just wondering...
you've been to prison, right?

158
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,486
You do have a problem.

159
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,859
No, I... I'm going to prison.

160
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:19,153
But I've never been there before
and I was just thinking maybe

161
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:20,989
you could give me some pointers.

162
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,288
- I'll pay you 100 bucks.
- Just for talking?

163
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,624
- How much time did you get?
- Three to five.

164
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,172
- Where at?
- Verlaine.

165
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:39,385
Verlaine? That's fucked, Stan.
Guards just don't give a damn.

166
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:43,175
They let the cons beat the shit
out of one another all day.

167
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:44,895
How am I gonna do in there?

168
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:48,514
I mean, if you saw me,
would you beat the shit out of me?

169
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,485
I'd probably rape ya.

170
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,603
- You'd rape me?
- Yeah.

171
00:10:57,075 --> 00:11:00,823
So it's true, huh?
A lot of guys turn gay in prison?

172
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,696
I'm always gay.
I only rape people in prison.

173
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:08,409
- You're gay?
- Yeah. This is a gay bar.

174
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:11,291
Whoo!

175
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,124
Let's do this thing.

176
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:17,125
Whoo!

177
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:21,846
Look, rape isn't an act of sex.
Rape is an act of violence.

178
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:25,183
And in prison society,
it's all about violence.

179
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,678
You're judged by how bad
other cons fear you.

180
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:30,940
Raping a dude is the ultimate way
of beating him down.

181
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,185
It means you're one bad motherfucker.

182
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,481
So you rape people?

183
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:39,692
Well, now that's something
I'm not real proud of.

184
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:43,699
I don't condone the practise,
to be honest. But I do it some.

185
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:47,122
Just to keep up with the Joneses.
You know what I mean.

186
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:51,124
Little dude like you,
be an easy mark.

187
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:55,459
Oh, Jesus!
Isn't there anything I could do?

188
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,543
You could join a gang.

189
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:00,257
- Are you a racist?
- Not really.

190
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,672
That leaves out the Nazis.

191
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:05,518
- Got any Mob connections?
- No.

192
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:08,223
- Wouldn't happen to be Latino?
- Uh-uh.

193
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,065
Looks like everybody's gonna rape you.

194
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:16,273
OK. OK, I... I bet I can be a racist
for three to five years.

195
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:19,233
- A real racist. Hardcore.
- Well, good.

196
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,732
- Then you can join the Nazis.
- Excellent.

197
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,867
You'll only be raped by other Nazis.

198
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:27,702
Raped by Nazis? No way!

199
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:29,119
Anything else I can do?

200
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:32,293
Isn't there some way I can
cultivate some outlaw image?

201
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:35,831
- You have to kill a dude.
- Without killing a dude?

202
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:39,341
In your case,
it'd be a real long shot, Stan.

203
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:42,547
- Wouldn't happen to have any tats?
- Tats?

204
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,430
Ink.

205
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:48,597
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
I didn't grow up with my mom. So I...

206
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,687
When I was 18, I got a tattoo.

207
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,354
"Mommy".

208
00:12:56,528 --> 00:13:00,062
You might as well buy a welcome mat,
strap it to your asshole.

209
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,031
Say, "I'm open for business. "

210
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,032
Whoo!

211
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,631
- Stan?
- I'm gonna get raped!

212
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,424
Stanny!

213
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:26,260
Stan, honey.
You wanna wake up?

214
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:29,433
It's 2.00.

215
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:33,391
- Good morning, dear.
- Good afternoon, Stan.

216
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:36,482
I got you some orange juice.

217
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,777
It was all a bad dream.

218
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,199
- Just a horrible dream.
- What was your dream, baby?

219
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,863
It was awful!

220
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:52,580
I was gonna go to prison
and big men were gonna rape me.

221
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:57,292
But here I am, safe in my bed.

222
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,123
It was all a bad dream.

223
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,837
But you are gonna be going
to prison, right?

224
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,343
- Huh?
- You're going to prison in six months.

225
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,429
No!

226
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,892
Oh! Oh!

227
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:17,515
Honey, it's OK.
A lot can happen in six months.

228
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:21,904
What's gonna happen, Mindy?
Is my anus gonna grow teeth?

229
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:27,698
No, silly! You'll find a way.
You always do.

230
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,363
What'd you just say?

231
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:32,028
You always find a way.

232
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,371
That's right. I always do.

233
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,037
My baby ready to eat breakfast?

234
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,163
Mindy...

235
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,012
...did I have a lot growing up?

236
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,260
No, I did not.
I had nothing growing up.

237
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:55,017
I had a drunk father
who was emotionally unavailable to me.

238
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:57,513
I had a summer job at Dairy Queen.

239
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,228
I had tomato soup for dinner.

240
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,394
Nobody ever gave me anything.

241
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,734
Truly, mine was
a hardscrabble existence.

242
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:08,735
Yet look at me today.

243
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,949
I own a palatial estate,

244
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,828
I drive a Lamborghini,

245
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,824
I have a summer house on the lake,

246
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:18,249
a complete Bang & Olufsen
home theatre system,

247
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,089
a beautiful wife.

248
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:24,790
And whom do I have to thank
for all this stuff?

249
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:27,803
Me. Nobody else.

250
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:31,422
Me. I am a winner.

251
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:35,514
I set my mind to do something,
and I do it.

252
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:42,350
And so when I say to you
that I will make myself un-rapeable,

253
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:46,062
I will be un-rapeable!

254
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,234
Yay!

255
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:53,279
<i># You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down</i>

256
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:58,413
<i># You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down</i>

257
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:00,494
<i>- # You're the best around</i>
- Ow!

258
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:05,668
<i># Nothing's gonna ever keep you down</i>

259
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,467
I got a couple of things in mind. But
first I got kind of a weird question.

260
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:20,682
Do you have anything you could tattoo
around my sphincter

261
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,351
to make it less attractive?

262
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:26,983
Fourteen, 15...

263
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:31,235
- Stanny, come to bed.
- Not... Not now, Mindy.

264
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,318
Nineteen, 25.

265
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:36,910
There.
You see new definition?

266
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,240
My forearm. I think I see a new vein.

267
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,125
I see a very sexy man.

268
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:44,087
You do?

269
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,544
Well, I wonder what he's gonna do next.

270
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:55,179
Take me, darling.

271
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:59,676
Mindy, I'm gonna go
to prison in a few months.

272
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,348
Not now, honey.

273
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,109
And while I'm there, men are gonna try
to take advantage of me.

274
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:10,065
- I don't wanna hear about this.
- This is important.

275
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,279
I'm doing everything I can

276
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,609
to make sure that doesn't happen.

277
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:17,491
But if it does happen,
and I do get violated...

278
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:18,826
Stan!

279
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,038
...I want the first time...

280
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,753
...to be by someone I love.

281
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:32,970
Oh!

282
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:35,843
Oh.

283
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,844
Stan, I couldn't.

284
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,187
Please, Min, for me.

285
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:51,068
Well... OK.

286
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,117
Great.

287
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:11,292
Oh, the horror!

288
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,508
Two!

289
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,671
Three! Four!

290
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:18,420
Five! Six!

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,684
Seven! Eight!

292
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:24,558
You must concentrate, Stanley.
Concentrate!

293
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:28,100
- How can I concentrate when I'm bored?
- If you're bored, leave.

294
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,687
Oh, come on, Cho.

295
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,940
- Master Cho!
- Master Cho.

296
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:37,282
I've been coming here for a week
and I'm still doing baby stuff.

297
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,528
When am I gonna learn to kick some ass?

298
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:43,203
I'm a yellow belt.
Nobody's afraid of a yellow belt.

299
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,581
You think you're ready
to move up in rank?

300
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:47,617
Yeah, that's right.

301
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:50,333
Fine. You'll have your chance.

302
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:54,290
- Hey, Seymour! Come on.
- All right.

303
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:57,304
Seymour.

304
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:00,093
You'll fight Seymour
for honour of green belt.

305
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:06,139
Want me to fight this little guy?

306
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:08,770
- All right.
- Fighting stance!

307
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,267
All right, Seymour.
See what you got.

308
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,030
Ah! Ah!

309
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:16,692
Oof!

310
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:26,785
- How do you like that, huh, Seymour?
- Stanley!

311
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,798
- Uh!
- You can forget about your refund!

312
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,969
Is that all you got?

313
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:48,140
Ah!

314
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:56,148
Pussy.

315
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,794
That's some technique you got.

316
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:35,105
You couldn't knock a shit
out of a paper bag full of shit.

317
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,937
Oh, and you could do better?

318
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,212
Any questions?

319
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:02,801
- Mindy!
- Dinner's almost ready!

320
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:05,048
- I got great news!
- What happened to you?

321
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:07,846
Never mind that.
I just met the best guy. Guess what?

322
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:11,305
- He's agreed to be my trainer.
- Really? What's his name?

323
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,471
The Master.

324
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:19,690
- How do you do...
- The Master.

325
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,406
He's gonna live with us and train me.

326
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:25,031
I have to pay him
when my accounts get unfrozen.

327
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:26,863
- Oh.
- Ahem.

328
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:28,698
And the contract.

329
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:31,198
Yeah, I'll write it up right now.

330
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:41,092
I'm so sorry, The Master,
but there's no smoking in the house.

331
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,722
Yes, there is.

332
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,717
I better heat up another Lean Cuisine.

333
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:55,764
Honey, you've done it again.
You heated it just perfect.

334
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:58,941
So...

335
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:02,196
...T he Master, where are you from?

336
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,192
Hell.

337
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,073
Oh! What brought you to LA? A job?

338
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:15,453
I travel where the wind takes me.

339
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,750
Isn't he great?

340
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:23,091
Well, how long have you been
teaching the art of self-defence?

341
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:29,803
Young lady,
what I teach is not art.

342
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:31,933
It is science.

343
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:37,145
A careful amalgam of the most
deadly parts of karate, kung fu,

344
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:41,813
Wing Chun, Krav Maga, Muay Thai,

345
00:22:41,988 --> 00:22:45,938
savate and Filipino Kali.

346
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:47,362
My favourite.

347
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,109
Ooh! Wow!

348
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:53,624
I find weakness

349
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,461
and turn it into strength.

350
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,629
I find fat and turn it into muscle.

351
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:04,506
I find blisters
and turn them into canker sores.

352
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:09,256
I find doubt
and I turn it into will.

353
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:11,674
You can stop doing that now.

354
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:14,223
- Doing what?
- Your hand.

355
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:19,729
Oh. I forgot it was there.

356
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:25,230
I'm gonna take a shit.

357
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:30,607
- Enjoy yourself.
- Mm.

358
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:36,203
Stan, honey,
does he really have to live here?

359
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:38,664
- The Master?
- He scares me.

360
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:42,704
I know. He scares me too. That's exactly
why he's the perfect guy to teach me.

361
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:45,587
- But, Stan...
- Look, want me to survive in prison?

362
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,927
- Of course I do.
- Then don't argue with me about this.

363
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:50,639
You'll see, he'll grow on you.

364
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,850
Wake up, weakling.

365
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:07,362
What the hell you doing in here?

366
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:10,865
It's time to begin your training.

367
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:13,324
But it's five in the morning.

368
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:16,414
- Is that liver?
- It's your breakfast.

369
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:21,825
And every moment you delay,
I squeeze out more of its vital juices.

370
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:24,330
Trust me, you'll need them later.

371
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:27,876
- OK, I'm up.
- But are you ready?

372
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:30,722
Look what I found beside your bed.

373
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:34,139
This is weakness.

374
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:37,678
This is defeatism.

375
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:40,475
Actually, we were kind of enjoying that.

376
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,641
Eat this.

377
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,935
And follow me.

378
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:53,792
Punch!
All right, now kick.

379
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,070
Punch!
All right, now kick.

380
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,536
Kick!

381
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:00,959
Kick like you mean it!

382
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:06,789
- Oh!
- I blended that gross stuff you wanted.

383
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:10,631
I got it all in Koreatown. I didn't
even know there was a Koreatown.

384
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,264
Too many eggs.

385
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:19,885
The fish oil is nice.
Ox pancreas is good.

386
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:24,107
- Next time, use more tongue.
- That's what she said.

387
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:26,019
- Ooh!
- Oh, Stan!

388
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:28,068
- I'm all right.
- Get away from him!

389
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:32,615
- I'm OK.
- Rise and drink your lunch.

390
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,414
Don't I get to eat anything
that tastes good?

391
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:50,664
- You like hot dogs?
- Yeah, sure.

392
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:53,169
If you don't drink that,

393
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:55,718
the boys in prison will feed you...

394
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,347
...many hot dogs.

395
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,987
I can kick your ass so fast
you wouldn't even feel it.

396
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:15,656
I'd like to see that.

397
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:19,030
You didn't kick me in the ass.
I didn't feel anything.

398
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,712
Ow! Ow!

399
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:32,338
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

400
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,384
Ow! Ow! Ow!

401
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,013
Oh! Ow! Ooh!

402
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,672
- Pain is interpretation.
- OK.

403
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,428
I'm gonna call a time-out here. You're
beating my husband with a flaming stick.

404
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:46,689
Isn't there some kind
of role-playing exercise you can do?

405
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:49,349
Run along, honey.
This is man stuff here.

406
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:51,271
Go ahead, Master.

407
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:53,688
Ow! Ow! Ow!

408
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:57,400
Ow! Ah! Oh!

409
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,700
Ow! Ah!

410
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:08,499
No disrespect, I realise this
is strengthening my nipples.

411
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:11,506
And believe me, I can feel the burn.

412
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:15,719
I was wondering,
just how important are strong nipples?

413
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:18,508
- Someday these nipples...
- Ah!

414
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:21,552
...may save your life.
- Ah!

415
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:26,393
You are what you eat.

416
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:29,850
Um, are you sure
that's Eastern mysticism?

417
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:33,027
Because I learned that
in health class in third grade.

418
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:34,820
Silence, woman.

419
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:38,939
I mean, all that stuff about pain
and illusion sounds totally mystical.

420
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:42,404
But "you are what you eat"?
Even I know that. And I am from Omaha.

421
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,450
What part of Omaha?

422
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:50,248
- Oh!
- Dundee.

423
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,917
Happy Hollow.

424
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,419
You're Oscar?

425
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:58,167
I should have known.

426
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:02,178
Those womanly, childbearing hips

427
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,392
could not be a product
of this perfidious coast.

428
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:10,849
Uh, do you mind?
I'm trying to eat scorpion here.

429
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:13,148
Insolent fool!

430
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:16,524
You have lost the right

431
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:19,236
to eat scorpion.

432
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:26,321
Great. There goes my lunch.

433
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,124
- Thanks.
- This is not working.

434
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,036
- Master says...
- Master's a jerk.

435
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,705
- Shh!
- He is!

436
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,458
And he is a creep. The house smells.
Does he have to smoke in every room?

437
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:40,466
The only time I see you alone is in bed
and you're too tired to...

438
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:44,007
Hey! I got five months, and then
it's prison. I gotta stay focused.

439
00:28:44,184 --> 00:28:48,644
I gotta think, eat, breathe prison.
I don't have time for anything else.

440
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:51,814
Not even time for me?

441
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,689
Tell you what.

442
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:59,231
After I'm done working out
with The Master, I'll rent some movies,

443
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:02,776
and we'll cuddle around the TV
like old times, OK?

444
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:04,744
Really?

445
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:14,077
Mindy!

446
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:17,090
Some men broke into the house!
They wanna rape you!

447
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:19,465
- What?
- Big men!

448
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:22,755
- They wanna rape you! Repeatedly!
- What about The Master?

449
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:26,430
They have guns! They killed him!
There's nothing we can do!

450
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:29,518
- You're gonna get raped! Raped!
- Oh, my God!

451
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:32,357
Raped!

452
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:34,481
Rape!

453
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:38,153
There.

454
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:43,776
- Now you know how I feel.
- What?

455
00:29:43,952 --> 00:29:47,534
Fear of rape. That's what I'm gonna
have to live with for three years.

456
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:51,288
Nobody broke
into the house?

457
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:52,657
That's right.

458
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:55,872
Now maybe you'll be supportive
of what I'm going through.

459
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:59,665
You son of a bitch!

460
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:03,549
- OK, you're upset.
- You son of a bitch!

461
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:06,509
- You don't have to call names. Mindy!
- Son of a bitch!

462
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:11,261
- Bitch, bitch, bitch! You bastard!
- Mindy. Mindy!

463
00:30:11,437 --> 00:30:14,723
Oh! Mindy.

464
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,569
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like? Leaving.

465
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:20,986
Why? Because I pull one little prank,
which when you calm down...

466
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:23,907
It's not just one prank!
You only think about yourself!

467
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:26,993
You're the most selfish man
who ever lived, ever! Ever!

468
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:30,577
Whoa! Excuse me? Selfish?
I find that funny! I really do!

469
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,121
I've given you everything
you've ever wanted!

470
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:34,870
- You're crazy!
- This house!

471
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:37,002
- It's in your name.
- Those boobs!

472
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:40,256
- You wanted these.
- You said the Lamborghini's too small,

473
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:44,339
- I got a second car.
- A 1955 Porsche Speedster!

474
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:47,513
- It has a back seat!
- Oh!

475
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:52,561
- What do you want? I'll do anything.
- I want a baby, you asshole!

476
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:55,646
That again? Fine. OK. You win.

477
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:58,306
- We'll have a baby.
- Really?

478
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:01,320
No, not really,
but we can visit people who have kids.

479
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:06,276
Goodbye!

480
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:10,485
Good, leave! I don't need you!

481
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:12,455
I don't need anybody!

482
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:15,162
<i>God!</i>

483
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:19,415
Uh, one moment. I'm... meditating.

484
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:26,340
<i>It's so big! Oh, God!</i>

485
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:28,137
Mindy left.

486
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:30,928
<i>- Yes, yes, yes!</i>
- Good.

487
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,101
<i>Oh, God!</i>

488
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,888
Now, the real training can begin.

489
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:44,363
We do not have time
to teach you the five fingers of death.

490
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:47,650
We have only time for one finger.

491
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:49,695
Pick one.

492
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:53,740
All right. Wait. This one.

493
00:31:57,836 --> 00:31:59,294
Hold this.

494
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,128
Your turn.

495
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,688
Ah! Ow!

496
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:31,697
Ah! Ah!

497
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:49,212
Ah!

498
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:03,765
<i># You don't know what to do, you're
sitting there and you're all alone</i>

499
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:06,351
Don't look at what you're doing.

500
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:09,566
Just feel. Feel.

501
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:13,276
<i># You've got no place to call your home</i>

502
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:16,786
I felt. It felt bad.

503
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,750
Oh!

504
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:27,708
You must learn to feel your opponent.
Know his intentions.

505
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:34,757
If he is good at a distance,
then you must be close.

506
00:33:38,603 --> 00:33:44,107
If he is good close,
then you must fight him at a distance.

507
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:54,279
What if your opponent is good close
and from a distance?

508
00:33:54,452 --> 00:33:56,492
Then you are up
to your eyeballs in shit.

509
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:59,201
Watch your mouth.
You are nobody.

510
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:02,699
Ow!

511
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:06,673
- Hey, what are those?
- A little something I picked up

512
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,794
- at the Shaolin temple.
- What do you use them for?

513
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:11,378
Oh!

514
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,595
Oh! Ow!

515
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:15,554
Oh! Ah!

516
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:18,306
Your lunch.

517
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,561
Yeah.

518
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:20,324
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right, that's close enough.

519
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,156
Whoo-hoo!

520
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:28,370
Hoo-hoo!

521
00:35:30,048 --> 00:35:32,669
Ah!

522
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:37,092
Never celebrate too early.

523
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:38,841
I'll remember that.

524
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,388
Yes.

525
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,477
Mississippi five, Mississippi six,

526
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,981
Mississippi seven, Mississippi eight,

527
00:35:57,158 --> 00:36:00,242
Mississippi nine...

528
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:02,653
My God! That is amazing!

529
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,823
Oh, that's nothing.
You should see him.

530
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:09,412
It's easy for me. Cigarettes have
ruined my circulation so much

531
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:12,257
I can't even feel my hands anymore.

532
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:14,333
So that's your trick.

533
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:16,051
Mm-hm.

534
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:21,262
Here's to Stan Minton,
my second finest student.

535
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:23,758
Second finest?

536
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,643
Who's number one?

537
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,813
I hope you never have to find that out.

538
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:32,600
He used what I taught him,
not for his own protection,

539
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:35,019
but for evil.

540
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:43,735
Well, fuck that guy.
Here's to number two.

541
00:36:43,913 --> 00:36:49,287
Now, drink up.
Stan has one final test.

542
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:52,004
Tonight.

543
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:57,883
I do? OK.

544
00:36:58,052 --> 00:36:59,677
Let's go for it.

545
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,738
Hello, Cho.

546
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:21,658
It's Master Cho to you.

547
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:26,038
Master Cho? Or Masturbator Cho?

548
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:30,334
- Excuse me?
- You heard me... punk.

549
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:37,382
Looking for a beat-down, mister?

550
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,919
What are you looking for?
To beat off?

551
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,839
That's it.

552
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:55,980
Ooh!

553
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:18,374
Very good, Stan.

554
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,673
You mind walking me to my car?

555
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:23,335
All right.

556
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:27,926
I don't feel too comfortable here.
I don't think the Asian people like me.

557
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:46,275
All right, you just go up those steps,
turn yourself in for processing.

558
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:48,825
By the way, slight change of plans.

559
00:38:48,997 --> 00:38:51,867
The Bureau of Prisons
called me yesterday.

560
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,126
They're sending you to Oaksburg,
not Verlaine.

561
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:59,162
- Why?
- Who knows? Bureaucracy.

562
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,460
It makes no difference.

563
00:39:04,012 --> 00:39:06,799
Go on. You'll do great.

564
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:09,844
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

565
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:16,854
Uh, did Mindy or her lawyer call
about the divorce?

566
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:22,896
It's not like I care anyway.
All right.

567
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:24,982
See you guys in three years.

568
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:35,082
- What do you think?
- I think you should walk away quickly.

569
00:39:43,593 --> 00:39:46,594
- Ah! Filthy pig!
- I need a beer.

570
00:39:46,763 --> 00:39:48,091
Oh!

571
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:50,969
Don't get in the car!

572
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:14,156
This your first time?

573
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:20,000
Hey, sweetie,
ain't you got a name?

574
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:22,294
Ah!

575
00:40:22,465 --> 00:40:25,799
Talk to me again,
I'll twist your whole damn titty off.

576
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:29,219
- Ooh, my mama, ooh, my mama.
- Hey, man, I'm scared too.

577
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,880
But it can't be as bad
as they say it is.

578
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:36,222
It's just as bad as they say.
The sooner you realise that, the better.

579
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:40,725
- Tell 'em.
- You'll find out, soon enough.

580
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,941
What'd I say about talking to me?

581
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:47,734
Damn, man!

582
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:13,468
Welcome to Oaksburg Penitentiary.

583
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:16,726
For reasons beyond
what I care to imagine,

584
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:20,643
you gentlemen have found yourselves
under my stewardship.

585
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:25,027
My name is Warden Francis Gasque.

586
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:27,602
But you can just call me Boss.

587
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,529
We only got one rule here at Oaksburg:

588
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:37,288
Don't fuck with the Boss. That means
you leave me and my men alone.

589
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:42,166
What you animals do to each other,
that's your business.

590
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:46,085
And right behind you
is the warden's garden.

591
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:51,418
Anybody caught pissing on that
will have his penis removed.

592
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:56,756
Sergeant Bullard will lead you
to the medical office where you'll strip

593
00:41:56,935 --> 00:42:01,015
and have your cavities searched.
You're gonna enjoy that.

594
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:05,483
Now, gentlemen! Single file.
Come on! Get up there.

595
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:06,683
Pecker to butt hole.

596
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,484
All right, assume the position.

597
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:23,956
Why you screaming like a little girl?!

598
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:27,165
Sarge, look.

599
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,131
Sweet Jesus!

600
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:36,097
It's like an alien
staring into my soul.

601
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:42,597
Welcome home. New luxury condos,
compliments of the state.

602
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:44,480
Step it up, boys.

603
00:42:50,488 --> 00:42:53,489
Come on, sweet meat!

604
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:06,376
Hello there, young fella.
I guess we're cellmates.

605
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,884
My name's Larry.
But you can call me Shorts.

606
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:14,589
Shorts, you're in my bunk.

607
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:18,677
- What?
- That's my bunk. Get out.

608
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,183
You hold on there
just a second.

609
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:25,722
This is my bunk.
What gives you the right to...

610
00:43:25,899 --> 00:43:27,476
Ow!

611
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,449
- I said that's my bunk.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

612
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:35,814
Whoo!

613
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,576
Uh, you might wanna change the sheets.

614
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:50,421
I'm kind of a compulsive masturbator.

615
00:43:55,386 --> 00:43:56,929
Shorts, that's your bunk.

616
00:43:57,096 --> 00:44:00,300
- Really?
- Absolutely.

617
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:04,389
Thanks, buddy.
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

618
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:05,843
Hey, put her here.

619
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:11,774
- I don't shake hands.
- Well, whatever.

620
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:18,273
Ah, good to be back.

621
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:23,163
Tell me, Shorts,
who's the toughest guy here?

622
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:25,573
Who's the biggest bad-ass
in the cell block?

623
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,000
Biggest bad-ass...
There's a lot of contenders.

624
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,120
There's Cleon. He's leader
of the Diamond Kings, the black gang.

625
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:38,092
- I seen him kill a man with his fist.
- That's right! Yeah!

626
00:44:38,263 --> 00:44:42,640
Then there's Juanito.
He's head of the Mexican gang.

627
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:44,801
Hey, get back. Hey!

628
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:48,643
And whatever you do,
don't go near those guys.

629
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:53,975
- The goal is to express ourselves...
- They're Scientologists.

630
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:57,688
- They don't look so tough.
- Yeah. They'll talk your ear off

631
00:44:57,866 --> 00:45:00,357
- and then sue your ass.
... distinguish fear.

632
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:04,485
Then there's the Nazis.
None of them are too tough.

633
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:08,744
They don't fight fair and don't fight
alone. They always gang up on you.

634
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:11,836
Their leader, Patterson,
he's a real bastard.

635
00:45:12,005 --> 00:45:15,456
His uncle's the head
of the Aryan Nation.

636
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:17,460
Let me clarify my question, Shorts.

637
00:45:17,635 --> 00:45:20,305
Who's the most
dangerous sexual predator?

638
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:22,429
Oh, that's easy.

639
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,765
It's Big Raymond.
Absolutely insatiable.

640
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:28,936
Crazy. The other black guys
don't go near him.

641
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:32,770
But they'd back him up
if it came to a fight.

642
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,184
Big Raymond it is.

643
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:37,235
- Can I borrow that?
- Yeah.

644
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:38,899
Thanks.

645
00:45:40,617 --> 00:45:43,321
Hey, Stan. Stan, where you going?

646
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:46,365
You think that cigarette was free?
Is that what you think?

647
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:49,209
I'll pay you back, man.
I don't have any money.

648
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,831
You think I want money?

649
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:54,208
Mmm...

650
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,963
- Excuse me.
- Bug off, bitch!

651
00:45:58,134 --> 00:46:00,542
I'll get to you later.

652
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,594
Did you just call me bitch?

653
00:46:04,057 --> 00:46:06,014
Yeah, I said it.

654
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:11,977
Hey, everybody! Did you hear that?

655
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:15,351
Big Raymond, for no reason,
just called me bitch!

656
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:17,234
Now, was that nice?

657
00:46:17,403 --> 00:46:20,155
It's not like I called him fat.

658
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:24,569
It's not like I said I seen pig shit
prettier than he is.

659
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:30,864
It's not like I said his mother's pussy
smells like egg salad.

660
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,584
Which it does.

661
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,131
Oh, hell nah! Ohhh, hell nah!

662
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:48,510
Hell nah! Oh, hell nah!

663
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:50,558
Ho-ho! Yeah!

664
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,866
Ah! Ah!

665
00:47:08,037 --> 00:47:10,659
Ahhh!

666
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:14,500
Who's the bitch now, bitch?

667
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:17,707
Ooh!

668
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:20,798
I told you Raymond was gonna get
his ass beat. I told you!

669
00:47:24,387 --> 00:47:27,174
My cracker!

670
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:29,804
Laying the boot to the big nigga.
Give it up!

671
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:32,847
Don't use that word around me.
It's ugly and racist.

672
00:47:34,355 --> 00:47:38,104
Yeah, dawg!

673
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:41,401
He's funny too, man.

674
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:44,406
All right, listen here, player.
All right?

675
00:47:44,574 --> 00:47:48,192
We want you to join up with us,
nah mean? Them niggas is gonna tear...

676
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:50,492
Ooh!

677
00:47:50,663 --> 00:47:52,537
I said don't talk that way around me.

678
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:54,082
Let me get some of that!

679
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,335
- Let's kill him.
- No, I got it, I got it. I got it!

680
00:47:58,171 --> 00:48:00,045
Handle your business, Cleon.

681
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:07,335
Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're gonna
stick up for that fat son of a bitch.

682
00:48:07,514 --> 00:48:10,847
You happen to see the colour
of that fat son of a bitch's skin?

683
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:13,223
Hey, aren't we over that?

684
00:48:13,394 --> 00:48:16,182
Didn't you see that <i>Nova</i> episode?
Huh, you guys?

685
00:48:16,356 --> 00:48:18,395
They did that DNA test.

686
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:21,022
- We all come from Africa.
- Kick his ass.

687
00:48:21,194 --> 00:48:25,441
It's a proven fact. Under the skin,
I'm just as black as you are.

688
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:27,074
- Fuck that.
- Get him!

689
00:48:27,242 --> 00:48:30,942
- Get him, man! Get him! Get him!
- Motherfucker!

690
00:48:37,377 --> 00:48:39,334
- Get him!
- Ah!

691
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:52,265
Man, get that fool!

692
00:49:05,113 --> 00:49:06,358
Dumb bitch!

693
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,451
Hold on. See what happens.

694
00:49:19,294 --> 00:49:21,417
- Oh!
- Ah!

695
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:40,728
Oh!

696
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:50,192
- Take the stick!
- No, don't take it!

697
00:49:56,998 --> 00:49:59,915
- Take the stick!
- No, don't take it!

698
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:03,543
Oh, he did it again.

699
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,300
- Take the stick! Take it!
- Mm-hm?

700
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:14,140
No, no, don't take it!

701
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,430
Whoo!

702
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:25,146
I told him
not to take that stick.

703
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,075
Even the Asian!

704
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:37,654
Where the hell did that guy come from?

705
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,704
- Whoo!
- Damn!

706
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:42,081
- That guy's good.
- All right.

707
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,125
Come on, Cleon.

708
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:46,965
It's your time, baby.
Don't be scared.

709
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:49,338
It's your time to shine, Cleon.

710
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:51,582
Ooh!

711
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:56,595
Cleon.

712
00:50:56,766 --> 00:51:00,894
If you wanna fight me,
you're gonna have to fight me.

713
00:51:01,062 --> 00:51:04,182
- I understand.
- Pick up your gold teeth.

714
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:07,856
I'm gonna let you keep them this time.

715
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:10,067
But if you come at me again...

716
00:51:10,697 --> 00:51:13,104
...I'm gonna hang onto them
like a Swiss banker.

717
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:31,003
Ya'll ain't gonna help me?

718
00:51:31,176 --> 00:51:33,845
I'm missing a bicuspid.

719
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:37,712
We should have killed him.

720
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:41,840
Somebody,
call an orthodontist.

721
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:50,017
Hm. I see Mr Minton
has acquainted himself

722
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:52,401
with his new surroundings.

723
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:56,402
I believe it's time I had
my little chat with him.

724
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:02,956
Ow!

725
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:08,703
Whoa, whoa, look out.

726
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,919
Beat it. All of you.

727
00:52:21,226 --> 00:52:25,519
Oh, man, this stuff's good. I don't know
what everybody's complaining about.

728
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:27,480
You're kidding me.

729
00:52:27,649 --> 00:52:30,733
Hey, man.
I just wanna say thanks.

730
00:52:32,028 --> 00:52:33,059
For what?

731
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:37,741
You know, for helping me before.

732
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,107
With Big Raymond.

733
00:52:39,285 --> 00:52:42,156
I wasn't helping you.
I was helping me.

734
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,037
I had to beat up the biggest shithead.
He happened to be talking to you.

735
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:49,503
OK.

736
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,797
But, you know, I... I mean, I...

737
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:55,959
I think that guy wanted to fuck me.

738
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:03,804
Trust me, in your case,
I was just putting off the inevitable.

739
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:13,018
Yeah.

740
00:53:13,194 --> 00:53:14,605
Well, thanks anyway.

741
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:19,899
What's your name, girl?
Don't be shy, just say hi.

742
00:53:20,785 --> 00:53:23,193
Come here. Kick back, baby girl!

743
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:26,372
Little hard on the kid, weren't you?

744
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:29,826
That's got nothing to do with me.
And I'm gonna keep it that way.

745
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:32,244
- You got that?
- Mm-hm.

746
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:50,477
One-one-five!

747
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:56,734
Minton, warden wants to see you.
Get up.

748
00:53:56,905 --> 00:53:59,277
- Me?
- Now! Walk!

749
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:02,199
Put your hands behind your back.

750
00:54:05,705 --> 00:54:08,872
Come in.

751
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:15,793
Minton, I'm glad you could make it.

752
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:19,334
- You can take the cuffs off him.
- Sure you wanna do that, Boss?

753
00:54:19,511 --> 00:54:21,587
I said take 'em off.

754
00:54:21,763 --> 00:54:24,336
It's all right.

755
00:54:24,516 --> 00:54:25,796
I already got 'em.

756
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:29,892
It's a matter of dislocating the wrists.

757
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:38,685
Ew! Ew, that is creepy!

758
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:42,113
You can wait outside.

759
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:44,274
Have a seat.

760
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:52,918
Warden, if this is about me
fighting in the yard, it...

761
00:54:53,086 --> 00:54:54,580
Cigar?

762
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:57,839
Thank you.

763
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:02,792
Brandy?

764
00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:06,720
Sure.

765
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:18,649
You know, you wardens should complain.

766
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:23,031
'Cause in the movies,
they always make you look like assholes.

767
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:28,276
Well,
I don't plan on being a warden forever.

768
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:31,076
- Is that right?
- Tell me, Minton.

769
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:33,621
What do you think of this place?

770
00:55:35,086 --> 00:55:37,494
It's OK, for a prison.

771
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:41,884
Not the prison. The land.

772
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:50,264
It's a nice sized property. Great views
of the foothills and city. Level grade.

773
00:55:50,435 --> 00:55:53,768
I'm assuming there's
bedrock beneath us.

774
00:55:53,938 --> 00:55:58,684
Easy access to downtown.
I see some nice development potential.

775
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,027
- Too bad you got a prison on it.
- Exactly.

776
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:06,526
You know, it's no accident
you came to Oaksburg.

777
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:09,572
I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

778
00:56:12,665 --> 00:56:14,325
What made you wanna do that?

779
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:18,170
Come here.

780
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,170
Oaksburg Estates.

781
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:29,757
I'm a silent partner, so to speak,
with some private investors

782
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:35,223
who would like to develop this land
into timeshare condominiums.

783
00:56:35,396 --> 00:56:39,264
I believe that's
your field of expertise.

784
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:42,858
- True.
- 'Course, all this is only possible

785
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:45,816
in the event the prison
ever closes down.

786
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,655
- Makes sense.
- You know, I'm in the prison business.

787
00:56:49,827 --> 00:56:52,497
I know how to break a man's will,
crush his spirit.

788
00:56:52,664 --> 00:56:56,875
But them real estate contracts,
those things put a real hurt on you.

789
00:56:57,043 --> 00:56:58,585
That's where you come in.

790
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:06,295
- What's in it for me?
- How would you like to be out of here

791
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:07,500
in a year?

792
00:57:09,722 --> 00:57:14,052
- But I've got a mandatory minimum.
- Wardens have great discretion

793
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:19,055
getting early parole, especially
to non-violent, first-time offenders.

794
00:57:19,232 --> 00:57:23,894
- Prisons are crowded, you know.
- The system is corrupt.

795
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,315
Me likey.

796
00:57:25,488 --> 00:57:29,071
But you gotta move the luxury units
closer to the lagoon.

797
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:31,911
That'll double rents.
Parking goes underground.

798
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:35,494
Wasting space. Eight extra units.
Whoever designed this is a moron.

799
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:38,666
- How will you get rid of the prison?
- Let me worry about that.

800
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:41,160
Tell me more about them parking spaces.

801
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:09,110
You strapped?

802
00:58:09,282 --> 00:58:11,654
He ain't gonna know what hit him,
nah mean?

803
00:58:24,088 --> 00:58:25,120
Ah!

804
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:30,334
That's gonna scar, you psycho.

805
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:37,473
Whoo!

806
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:50,195
You want that shiv, don't you?

807
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:54,737
You made that with a melted toothbrush
and a razorblade?

808
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:56,654
- That's very creative.
- Ah!

809
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:06,086
Look what I made
with three bars of soap and a shoelace.

810
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,249
Cracker, please.

811
00:59:09,425 --> 00:59:12,877
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

812
00:59:26,985 --> 00:59:28,977
Come on, race traitor.

813
00:59:31,656 --> 00:59:33,814
- Ah!
- Ooh!

814
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,039
Oh!

815
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,455
Ha!

816
00:59:45,628 --> 00:59:47,787
Hee-yah!

817
00:59:49,757 --> 00:59:51,382
He's all yours.

818
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:54,969
This gonna be fun.

819
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:08,640
Hey, Stan. What'd you do to Patterson?

820
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:11,190
I just roughed him up a little bit.

821
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:15,111
- Why?
- Somebody took a shiv to his ass.

822
01:00:15,283 --> 01:00:19,992
They say he'll be shitting sideways
for a month.

823
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:22,998
Now I know
what schadenfreude feels like.

824
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:25,040
- What?
- Schadenfreude.

825
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:28,958
It's German for when you feel good
because your enemy's anus is violated.

826
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,087
Oh.

827
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:36,969
You know you're getting that on me.

828
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:43,893
<i>I'm doing great.
You guys are pussies.</i>

829
01:00:44,062 --> 01:00:48,522
That's terrific. Hey, listen, pal.
I need your help.

830
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:51,941
I can't get Mindy's lawyer
to return my call.

831
01:00:52,111 --> 01:00:54,519
If we wanna go through
with this divorce,

832
01:00:54,697 --> 01:00:58,066
you're going to have
to contact her personally.

833
01:00:58,993 --> 01:01:00,274
<i>Stan.</i>

834
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:02,113
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

835
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:05,704
<i>How's the appeal coming?</i>

836
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:10,833
Believe it or not, I'm looking
at the Madam Foreman right now.

837
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:12,797
<i>That's great.</i>

838
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:18,387
I gotta go now.
You know, duty calls.

839
01:01:18,555 --> 01:01:20,843
All right. Thanks, Lew.
I'll talk to you soon.

840
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:33,060
Ain't you Charlize Theron?

841
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:37,655
Oh, look what fell out there.

842
01:01:43,913 --> 01:01:47,448
So I had them
exchange the beef for horse meat.

843
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,662
- Clever.
- That's Stan.

844
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:53,244
Minton, I'd like for you
to meet Mr Dang.

845
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:55,462
He's on the prison's board of governors.

846
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:59,678
They let Vietnamese mafia on
the prison board of governors?

847
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:02,635
Your finger tats.

848
01:02:04,017 --> 01:02:09,640
Like you say, Stan,
the system is corrupt.

849
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:13,978
Mr Dang's family happens to be
my partners in Oaksburg Estates.

850
01:02:14,152 --> 01:02:16,904
Oh, good, 'cause I was just
going over the contracts.

851
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:20,191
The language gets rather vague
on gross versus net liability.

852
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:23,866
I'm sure it's unintentional, but that
could screw you in the long run.

853
01:02:24,037 --> 01:02:29,031
Could it? I'll have my lawyers
correct that immediately.

854
01:02:29,209 --> 01:02:32,660
I got an excellent lawyer for that.
He specialises in it. Lew Popper.

855
01:02:32,837 --> 01:02:36,289
Popper? I'll be sure to contact him.

856
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:40,333
Come on, Dang,
let's check out the floor show.

857
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,635
It looks like the savages
are ready for the inspection.

858
01:02:49,812 --> 01:02:54,521
Well, give me a few more weeks.
I'll even have 'em readier.

859
01:02:54,692 --> 01:02:56,650
I'm counting on that.

860
01:02:58,112 --> 01:03:00,319
Would you like a strawberry?

861
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:04,861
- I grew them in my own garden.
- Thank you.

862
01:03:05,036 --> 01:03:07,527
Minton? Strawberry?

863
01:03:08,623 --> 01:03:09,738
No, I'm good.

864
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,750
Maybe I picked 'em
a little too soon.

865
01:03:20,718 --> 01:03:22,676
I don't think that's it.

866
01:03:24,097 --> 01:03:26,670
<i>People
are scared shitless of me.</i>

867
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,178
Very good, Stan.

868
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,640
<i>Is there anyone there
who can challenge you?</i>

869
01:03:30,812 --> 01:03:33,517
Nah. I got it all under control.

870
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,848
What's the matter, Stan?

871
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:39,229
You sound... distant.

872
01:03:39,404 --> 01:03:41,112
<i>I don't know. It's just...</i>

873
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:44,981
Don't you ever find yourself
feeling sorry for anybody?

874
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:48,825
You might as well ask me
if I feel sorry for the maggots

875
01:03:48,997 --> 01:03:50,870
I grind into my morning coffee.

876
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,575
That's how I feel too.
Listen, I gotta go.

877
01:03:54,752 --> 01:03:57,623
Make me proud, Stan.

878
01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:00,466
Come on, baby!
Do it to me!

879
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,959
- Oh, yeah!
- Are you using me?

880
01:04:03,136 --> 01:04:05,342
- No!
- Don't you love me?

881
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:07,589
- Yeah!
- Show me!

882
01:04:14,814 --> 01:04:17,851
- Do you love me?
- Yeah. Hello. Hey!

883
01:04:18,026 --> 01:04:20,943
Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah.

884
01:04:21,112 --> 01:04:23,947
Hi, Stan. Yeah.
I think I have good news.

885
01:04:24,115 --> 01:04:28,065
- Do you love me?
- Yeah. I think the... I think the...

886
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:33,665
The Madam Foreman is just one orgasm
away from giving you your appeal.

887
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:36,620
<i>That's great, Lew.
And gross.</i>

888
01:04:36,794 --> 01:04:38,834
Heard from Mindy or her attorney?

889
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:41,081
Uh, no.

890
01:04:41,257 --> 01:04:45,089
But don't say I don't earn my money.

891
01:04:50,642 --> 01:04:54,474
Hi, fellas.
I don't believe I ordered Chinese.

892
01:04:58,024 --> 01:05:01,642
I guess I could go
for a little pot-sticker.

893
01:05:06,533 --> 01:05:08,324
Who are you writing to?

894
01:05:08,493 --> 01:05:10,818
No one special.

895
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:15,455
You've been sitting there for a while
writing to no one special.

896
01:05:17,669 --> 01:05:22,710
You know, Stan, I've been here for a
long time. I can handle a lot of things.

897
01:05:22,882 --> 01:05:26,583
Like having to spend the rest
of my life in this shithole.

898
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:30,011
But there's one thing I do regret.

899
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:33,681
I could never make it work
with Miyoshi.

900
01:05:33,852 --> 01:05:39,854
Oh, she was the only person
who ever loved me for me.

901
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:44,902
I was too pigheaded to realise it.

902
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:50,410
I'd give anything
to change the way I behaved.

903
01:05:51,244 --> 01:05:53,035
How did you behave?

904
01:05:54,163 --> 01:05:55,326
I killed her.

905
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,328
Oh.

906
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:03,329
Alcohol wasn't something that always
brought out the best in me, Stan.

907
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:27,565
<i>Dear Mindy, I've been
thinking a lot about you lately.</i>

908
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:29,530
<i>About us.</i>

909
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:31,857
<i>I realise now that you were right.</i>

910
01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:35,404
<i>I was pigheaded and selfish.</i>

911
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,163
<i>Leaving me was probably
the best thing for you.</i>

912
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,326
<i>And I'm truly sorry.</i>

913
01:06:41,503 --> 01:06:44,207
<i>I never should have hurt you.</i>

914
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:47,417
<i>I know now why you wanted
to have a baby with me.</i>

915
01:06:47,592 --> 01:06:49,881
<i>It's just another way
for us to love each other</i>

916
01:06:50,053 --> 01:06:52,804
<i>even more deeply.</i>

917
01:06:52,972 --> 01:06:56,507
<i>I hope, someday,
you'll be able to forgive me.</i>

918
01:06:56,684 --> 01:06:59,602
<i>Love always, Stan.</i>

919
01:07:05,026 --> 01:07:06,734
Hey, baby.

920
01:07:15,453 --> 01:07:19,451
Now, I know all of you want to get back
to your weightlifting and basketball

921
01:07:19,624 --> 01:07:23,075
and masturbating, so I'm gonna
try to keep this short. All right?

922
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:28,757
I am throwing away all of these
violent video games and movies.

923
01:07:30,718 --> 01:07:33,174
Don't do that! No! Come on, man!

924
01:07:33,346 --> 01:07:36,881
From now on, I want you guys
watching more wholesome entertainment.

925
01:07:37,058 --> 01:07:40,557
And frankly, a lot of the rap music
you brothers listen to

926
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:43,184
was too hateful towards women.

927
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:46,440
What is up with that?
You like women, right?

928
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:47,807
Yeah!

929
01:07:47,986 --> 01:07:49,729
Now, on the other hand,

930
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:53,107
the Mexicans are onto something
with mariachi and salsa music.

931
01:07:57,036 --> 01:08:00,370
It's positive, easy to dance to
and you never get tired of it.

932
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,410
- Shorts, give us a taste.
- Here we go.

933
01:08:39,037 --> 01:08:40,661
Holy shit.

934
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:45,833
All right. All right, all right.

935
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:49,537
That's Afro-Cuban. I asked
for mariachi. But you get the point.

936
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,917
All right? Now, lastly,
and most importantly,

937
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:56,010
from now on, there will
be no more rape at this prison.

938
01:08:56,179 --> 01:08:58,717
No, no!

939
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:02,259
That's right.
Anyone who rapes another inmate

940
01:09:02,435 --> 01:09:05,306
- will have to answer to me.
- Boo!

941
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,188
I will not be kind.

942
01:09:07,357 --> 01:09:10,227
- Excuse me, Big Stan.
- Yes, Juanito.

943
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:12,857
Why you putting your nose
where it don't belong?

944
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:15,271
My men are aggressive and hard.

945
01:09:15,448 --> 01:09:19,316
Sometimes they need a way to work off
that excess energy. What's it to you?

946
01:09:19,494 --> 01:09:22,495
- OK. Well, first off, good question.
- Thank you.

947
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:26,875
What is it to me?
Well, frankly, I just don't like it.

948
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:30,910
And let me show you why.
Robbie, come up here.

949
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:32,963
You, Robbie the hippie.
Come up here.

950
01:09:37,846 --> 01:09:41,760
All right, all right. Robbie, how long
is your sentence here at Oaksburg?

951
01:09:41,933 --> 01:09:45,847
- Five to ten.
- Five to ten years.

952
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,891
What exactly did you do
to earn that sentence?

953
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:52,564
I sold marijuana.

954
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:56,401
A shitload of marijuana.

955
01:09:58,616 --> 01:10:00,775
Thanks, Robbie. Go sit down.

956
01:10:00,952 --> 01:10:04,487
He sold marijuana.
He was a marijuana dealer.

957
01:10:04,664 --> 01:10:08,578
I'm not here to argue about drug policy.
I don't think they're tough enough.

958
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:12,452
Whatever.

959
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,999
But just because Robbie was guilty
of selling dope

960
01:10:16,176 --> 01:10:21,170
doesn't mean he deserves to get raped
up the ass every day for ten years.

961
01:10:21,347 --> 01:10:23,589
I just don't think that's fair.

962
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:26,803
Some of you are here

963
01:10:26,978 --> 01:10:32,933
because you're habitual drunk drivers.
Some of you have a fondness for crack.

964
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:36,276
Some of you robbed a bank.

965
01:10:36,446 --> 01:10:40,111
I'm talking to you, Lee Otis.

966
01:10:42,452 --> 01:10:46,284
But that doesn't mean you should
get raped. It's just not fair.

967
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:51,457
- Yes, Carnahan.
- What about guys convicted of rape?

968
01:10:51,628 --> 01:10:54,961
- Can we rape them?
- Yeah!

969
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:57,207
Rape the rapists.
Seems appropriate.

970
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:59,921
Punishment fitting the crime and all.
Go ahead.

971
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,965
That's what I'm talkin' about.

972
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:07,718
- How about them child molesters?
- Yeah!

973
01:11:07,894 --> 01:11:10,266
Yeah, them too. Good point.
Anyone else?

974
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:16,808
Big Stan!

975
01:11:16,986 --> 01:11:21,316
- What about the counterfeiters?
- What?

976
01:11:21,491 --> 01:11:25,820
Counterfeiters? Big Raymond,
you're the only counterfeiter here.

977
01:11:25,995 --> 01:11:28,830
Yeah!

978
01:11:28,998 --> 01:11:32,165
Wait a minute.
Do you just want somebody to...

979
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:34,707
Aw!

980
01:11:34,879 --> 01:11:37,038
OK, here's another thing
we gotta clear up.

981
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:40,335
There's a difference
between homosexual sex and rape.

982
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:44,093
- Now, Big Raymond.
- Hm?

983
01:11:44,264 --> 01:11:47,099
There's someone here
who wants to have sex with you.

984
01:11:47,267 --> 01:11:49,758
- Not me!
- OK? How about it, anyone?

985
01:11:51,771 --> 01:11:54,855
Yeah. Yeah.

986
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:01,188
Tyler!

987
01:12:01,364 --> 01:12:05,907
- Great!
- Man!

988
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,540
You two have fun.
But wear protection.

989
01:12:18,715 --> 01:12:20,707
OK.

990
01:12:20,884 --> 01:12:25,592
All right, grow up. Look, if you've got
a problem with that, then that's...

991
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:30,976
Nurse!

992
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:41,142
Now, those two are about to have
consensual homosexual sex.

993
01:12:41,321 --> 01:12:44,322
A beautiful, beautiful thing.
The total opposite of rape,

994
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:47,694
- which is not allowed.
- Except for rapists and molesters?

995
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:50,075
- We can still rape them.
- No, you can't.

996
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:53,662
- What?
- I changed my mind.

997
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,411
Bad habit. Quit cold turkey.

998
01:12:55,585 --> 01:12:59,001
If you're not happy with it,

999
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:02,920
you're welcome to fight me.

1000
01:13:03,843 --> 01:13:06,417
I didn't think so.
All right, you're dismissed.

1001
01:13:06,596 --> 01:13:08,802
Beat it.

1002
01:13:10,225 --> 01:13:12,716
- Good speech.
- You think?

1003
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:15,811
- I should have opened with a joke.
- No, it was good.

1004
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,266
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sorry about the mariachi.

1005
01:13:19,442 --> 01:13:20,640
Let it go.

1006
01:13:22,654 --> 01:13:27,066
Hey, Big Stan.
Check out the lovebirds.

1007
01:13:29,661 --> 01:13:32,578
One for you!

1008
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:35,665
Mm! One for you.

1009
01:13:36,835 --> 01:13:38,033
Good for them.

1010
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:41,912
I have something important to show you.

1011
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,252
Let me eat, will you?

1012
01:13:43,424 --> 01:13:44,669
Hey, Big Stan.

1013
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,135
- Can we talk?
- Make it quick.

1014
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:52,513
I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

1015
01:13:52,684 --> 01:13:56,053
- I didn't do anything...
- Don't say you didn't do it for me.

1016
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:59,396
Because you did, didn't you?

1017
01:14:00,733 --> 01:14:03,937
- A little.
- Well, thanks.

1018
01:14:04,112 --> 01:14:07,528
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- Julio!

1019
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:10,403
Get back here!
What's up with you?

1020
01:14:10,577 --> 01:14:11,691
Shut up!

1021
01:14:14,873 --> 01:14:17,957
Hey, Big Stan.
I like what you said.

1022
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:19,537
I wanna join your gang.

1023
01:14:21,546 --> 01:14:25,246
- I don't have a gang.
- Yes, you do.

1024
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:30,877
OK, you're in.

1025
01:14:33,308 --> 01:14:36,926
Me too?

1026
01:14:41,941 --> 01:14:46,437
Yeah, you too.

1027
01:14:49,157 --> 01:14:52,027
- All of you.
- Thanks.

1028
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:56,619
Yeah! Ow!

1029
01:14:56,789 --> 01:14:59,197
All right, can I eat now?

1030
01:15:01,794 --> 01:15:04,998
- Yes, you did!
- He's gotta eat.

1031
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,471
I told you I had something important
to show you.

1032
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:18,925
From Mindy.

1033
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:29,565
She wants to see me.

1034
01:15:37,163 --> 01:15:38,907
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1035
01:15:53,263 --> 01:15:54,757
Shake hands.

1036
01:15:58,268 --> 01:16:00,344
Try to get along, huh?

1037
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:10,070
Thanks.

1038
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:25,537
- Excuse me, man.
- No, that was my bad.

1039
01:16:25,712 --> 01:16:28,333
No, really. It was my fault.

1040
01:16:28,506 --> 01:16:31,673
There's a pickup game of hoops later,
if you wanna play.

1041
01:16:31,843 --> 01:16:32,922
I'd like that.

1042
01:17:13,843 --> 01:17:17,508
- Happy birthday.
- Ah! Thank you!

1043
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,432
- Oh, look, a shiv!
- Yeah!

1044
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,094
- Hey, homes.
- Mm! Mm!

1045
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:24,759
- Hey.
- Hey!

1046
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:58,133
Stanley! Honey bear!

1047
01:17:58,304 --> 01:18:00,593
I loved your letter!

1048
01:18:00,765 --> 01:18:03,600
I missed you so much.

1049
01:18:03,768 --> 01:18:07,813
Before we go any further, there's
three little words I need to hear.

1050
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:10,935
- I was wrong?
- Good boy!

1051
01:18:13,862 --> 01:18:16,862
It looks like
a nursery school picnic out there.

1052
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:18,574
It's Minton.

1053
01:18:19,784 --> 01:18:23,996
- What do you mean, it's Minton?
- Well, first he banned rape.

1054
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:26,452
It's to the point
that anybody gets beat up,

1055
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:29,874
they run and join Minton's gang
and Minton beats up the bad guy.

1056
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:33,248
The truth, he's got them too scared
to look at each other funny.

1057
01:18:33,423 --> 01:18:37,171
- We ain't had a fight in three days.
- I thought I saw Ingleberg fight

1058
01:18:37,343 --> 01:18:40,463
that big Mexican yesterday, Jesus.

1059
01:18:40,638 --> 01:18:44,422
Oh, no, that was more in the nature
of a lovers' quarrel.

1060
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:47,008
Ingleberg forgot their
two-week anniversary.

1061
01:18:47,187 --> 01:18:49,891
That wasn't very nice of him, was it?

1062
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:54,145
Well, they made up. You should
have seen the cake Ingleberg made.

1063
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:56,810
- It was special...
- You get out of here right now

1064
01:18:56,988 --> 01:19:00,606
and get Minton up here!
You understand me? I mean right now!

1065
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:03,950
Now hurry!

1066
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:09,447
I'm not just saying this, but I think
that was the most amazing sex

1067
01:19:09,626 --> 01:19:12,377
we've ever had.

1068
01:19:12,545 --> 01:19:15,297
I guess being away from me
this long made you crazy.

1069
01:19:15,465 --> 01:19:19,593
Well, yes, I guess.
The Master's opened my eyes, sexually.

1070
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:23,130
He showed me all these different
positions in the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

1071
01:19:23,306 --> 01:19:26,757
- The Master? You been seeing him?
- Yeah, he's staying at the house.

1072
01:19:26,935 --> 01:19:30,054
I've learned about massage
and strengthening my Kegels.

1073
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:33,396
That sleazy son of a bitch!

1074
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:35,891
- Minton, time's up.
- But Stan, I...

1075
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:39,936
- Warden wants to see you now!
- Wait. I don't want you to see him.

1076
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:44,527
You tell Master Dickface I'm gonna get
out of here soon and kick his ass!

1077
01:19:44,702 --> 01:19:47,075
Don't tell him.
You're not allowed to see him.

1078
01:19:47,247 --> 01:19:49,370
I said now, convict!

1079
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:51,248
- Minton!
- Not allowed to see him!

1080
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:53,624
- I love you, sweetie-cakes!
- Let's go.

1081
01:19:53,795 --> 01:19:55,419
Cocksucker!

1082
01:20:04,931 --> 01:20:07,636
I'll bet you didn't know
I was part psychic.

1083
01:20:09,686 --> 01:20:14,146
That's right.
I'm able to see into the future.

1084
01:20:15,775 --> 01:20:18,859
- I didn't realise.
- Let me tell you what's going to happen

1085
01:20:19,028 --> 01:20:21,270
one week from today.

1086
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,534
The board of governors
is gonna come to inspect the prison.

1087
01:20:27,704 --> 01:20:31,832
And something awful happens.

1088
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,412
Some prisoners find a way
to smuggle weapons into the yard.

1089
01:20:36,588 --> 01:20:39,209
And a full-scale riot breaks out.

1090
01:20:39,382 --> 01:20:43,546
And as the prison board watches
in absolute horror,

1091
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,848
my men are forced to shoot
into the yard in order

1092
01:20:48,016 --> 01:20:51,017
to end the melee.

1093
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:56,262
In the ensuing scandal,
the Board chooses to sell the property

1094
01:20:56,441 --> 01:20:59,857
to a Vietnamese family

1095
01:21:00,028 --> 01:21:02,779
based in San Pedro.

1096
01:21:02,947 --> 01:21:06,233
And everybody lives happily ever after.

1097
01:21:07,327 --> 01:21:08,987
Especially me.

1098
01:21:09,162 --> 01:21:13,456
Now, if the events that I foretold

1099
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:16,080
do not come to fruition...

1100
01:21:17,837 --> 01:21:21,123
...I will be very disappointed.

1101
01:21:28,598 --> 01:21:30,674
And when I get disappointed,

1102
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,057
Mr Deng over there

1103
01:21:33,228 --> 01:21:37,973
likes to stomp on men's spines
like they was bubble wrap.

1104
01:21:51,913 --> 01:21:56,491
I spent 35 years of my life

1105
01:21:56,668 --> 01:22:00,202
in this stinking cesspool.

1106
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:04,958
And I will not walk away
without something to show for it.

1107
01:22:06,261 --> 01:22:09,297
Your little prison reform
ends right now.

1108
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:14,558
You play ball,
you might get yourself a parole hearing.

1109
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:17,432
How many will get killed?

1110
01:22:17,605 --> 01:22:22,600
Who cares? They're all animals.

1111
01:22:24,737 --> 01:22:26,148
Bullard!

1112
01:22:28,491 --> 01:22:32,987
- Escort Mr Minton back to his cell.
- Yes, sir. Come on, Minton.

1113
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:41,876
Stan, you ever have two Asian men
pounding your balls

1114
01:22:42,046 --> 01:22:44,917
after sex with a questionably
attractive older woman?

1115
01:22:45,091 --> 01:22:47,416
No, I can't say I have, Lew.

1116
01:22:47,594 --> 01:22:51,461
Madam Foreman won't return
any of my calls.

1117
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:54,759
You better go for that deal
the warden offered you.

1118
01:22:54,934 --> 01:22:59,727
- So there's nothing else I can do?
- I'm sorry, pal. It's over.

1119
01:22:59,898 --> 01:23:02,186
<i>You're in real danger.</i>

1120
01:23:02,358 --> 01:23:05,110
Get yourself out of there
as soon as you can.

1121
01:23:33,014 --> 01:23:34,722
Bullard.

1122
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,927
Tell the warden I'll take his deal.

1123
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:41,056
I want out of here.

1124
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:52,528
Hey, Stan. The Nazis were saying
the Virgin Mary tortilla's a fake.

1125
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,701
- That's not cool, homes.
- Hey, the Nazis were saying

1126
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,530
the Virgin Mary has no power.

1127
01:23:57,705 --> 01:24:00,825
Constantine was pacifying
the Byzantine priest by giving him

1128
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,701
a goddess to pray to. They've been
watching the History Channel.

1129
01:24:04,879 --> 01:24:08,165
- What?
- What are you gonna do about it?

1130
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:11,093
I'm not gonna do anything about it.

1131
01:24:13,513 --> 01:24:14,841
What's up with him, man?

1132
01:24:15,014 --> 01:24:18,015
Hey, Stan. Stan!

1133
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:22,136
The Brazilians won't
stop calling Farib an Arab.

1134
01:24:22,313 --> 01:24:25,184
I'm not an Arab! I'm Persian.

1135
01:24:25,358 --> 01:24:28,561
What do I care?
You look like an Arab.

1136
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:32,364
Hey, listen up! All of you!

1137
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:36,986
You're all on your own!
You hear me?

1138
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:39,653
I don't care what any of you
do to each other!

1139
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:42,404
Hey, you guys!

1140
01:24:43,877 --> 01:24:45,501
An interracial book club.

1141
01:24:47,505 --> 01:24:50,708
You guys all hate each other.
So stop pretending you don't.

1142
01:24:50,884 --> 01:24:54,549
- You don't know about <i>Macbeth.</i>
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

1143
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,529
Yeah, that's more like it. Yes, sir.

1144
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:39,508
Big Stan?

1145
01:25:42,018 --> 01:25:43,560
We need to talk.

1146
01:26:00,537 --> 01:26:02,244
I thought you cared about us.

1147
01:26:04,582 --> 01:26:05,958
Well, I don't.

1148
01:26:13,466 --> 01:26:16,004
Hey, little cracker.

1149
01:26:17,554 --> 01:26:21,338
Why don't you sit over here,
my little white brother.

1150
01:26:35,572 --> 01:26:37,363
Here, have mine.

1151
01:26:38,366 --> 01:26:40,572
I'm gonna need to shave your head.

1152
01:26:40,743 --> 01:26:44,409
Put a couple little tattoos
on your forehead, huh?

1153
01:26:45,415 --> 01:26:46,826
Come on, eat up.

1154
01:26:50,712 --> 01:26:53,000
I was wrong about you.

1155
01:26:53,173 --> 01:26:55,082
We all were.

1156
01:26:56,759 --> 01:27:00,175
Stay out of the yard tomorrow.
You hear me?

1157
01:27:06,895 --> 01:27:10,727
D- block houses some
of our most hardened offenders.

1158
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:15,525
But here, we have Oaksburg's
greatest rehabilitation story.

1159
01:27:15,695 --> 01:27:20,357
Stan Minton. Stan, I'd like for you
to meet the board of governors.

1160
01:27:21,743 --> 01:27:24,364
Not going in the yard today, Stan?

1161
01:27:24,537 --> 01:27:27,823
- I don't feel well, warden.
- Maybe this will make you feel better.

1162
01:27:27,999 --> 01:27:31,913
Due to Stan's exemplary behaviour,
the parole board has agreed

1163
01:27:32,086 --> 01:27:34,494
to meet with him today.

1164
01:27:35,256 --> 01:27:37,830
Well, we better be moving along.

1165
01:27:43,306 --> 01:27:46,390
The shit goes down at 12.30.

1166
01:27:46,559 --> 01:27:50,937
At 12.35,
I'm in the real estate business.

1167
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:26,088
Stan! Honey!

1168
01:28:29,561 --> 01:28:31,518
- I'll deal with you in a minute.
- Everything OK?

1169
01:28:31,688 --> 01:28:33,182
Both of you.

1170
01:28:37,569 --> 01:28:40,523
Next up is prisoner 5824.

1171
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:43,991
In the matter of Stanley Minton.
You have your files.

1172
01:28:47,662 --> 01:28:51,612
In his time here, Minton
has accrued an exemplary record.

1173
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:55,290
And let it be noted,
he's a first-time non-violent offender.

1174
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:03,708
Hold up!

1175
01:29:03,887 --> 01:29:07,137
Before we vote, Mr Minton, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1176
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:10,557
I'd just like to say, um...

1177
01:29:10,727 --> 01:29:12,850
...I've really learned a lot.

1178
01:29:13,021 --> 01:29:15,476
And I'm ready to get back to work.

1179
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:19,308
Good, we like to hear that.

1180
01:29:20,653 --> 01:29:23,903
Here's the yard where the prisoners
come to exercise.

1181
01:29:24,073 --> 01:29:27,656
That's where Charlie the Fly
tried to fly over the wall.

1182
01:29:27,827 --> 01:29:31,113
Well, in light of Warden Gasque's
recommendation,

1183
01:29:31,289 --> 01:29:34,788
I think we have a pretty
clear-cut case for parole.

1184
01:29:37,378 --> 01:29:39,667
Mr Minton?

1185
01:29:42,175 --> 01:29:45,425
How would you feel
about getting out of here today?

1186
01:29:49,724 --> 01:29:51,384
Mr Minton?

1187
01:29:55,563 --> 01:29:57,307
Did I mention I'm in real estate?

1188
01:29:58,525 --> 01:30:02,107
I got my eye on some property
real close by here

1189
01:30:02,278 --> 01:30:06,490
- I can't wait to develop.
- Hm. That's commendable.

1190
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:10,276
You know, while I was in here,
also, I joined a biker gang.

1191
01:30:10,453 --> 01:30:13,288
Satan's Paedophiles.

1192
01:30:13,456 --> 01:30:15,532
Anyway, they said when I get out,

1193
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:18,662
they'd love to camp next
to the grammar school near here.

1194
01:30:18,837 --> 01:30:20,247
I hope that's not a problem.

1195
01:30:20,421 --> 01:30:24,918
They're pretty cool guys, except
when they drink and do crystal meth.

1196
01:30:25,093 --> 01:30:26,670
Which is almost every weekend.

1197
01:30:26,845 --> 01:30:31,637
But most of the people I sell to,
they don't need to know about that.

1198
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:35,936
'Cause, uh, they're old ladies, mostly.
Not too good with fine print,

1199
01:30:36,104 --> 01:30:37,218
if you get my drift.

1200
01:30:38,898 --> 01:30:42,647
Tell me, is your grandma still alive?
I bet I could make her a sweet deal.

1201
01:30:42,819 --> 01:30:44,895
By the time I'm through with her,

1202
01:30:45,071 --> 01:30:49,863
she'll give hand jobs behind the pharmacy
to pay for arthritis medication.

1203
01:30:51,661 --> 01:30:54,697
Two at a time, you know?
Stuff you see in pornos.

1204
01:30:56,833 --> 01:31:00,878
Anyway, that's a nice top you have on.
Seriously.

1205
01:31:01,045 --> 01:31:03,750
Mind lowering it?
I'd love to see some boobage.

1206
01:31:04,966 --> 01:31:07,967
Let me see that, woman. That's sexy.
Let me see that.

1207
01:31:08,136 --> 01:31:11,421
Let me touch one of them.
Let me touch one of them. Can I? Please?

1208
01:31:11,598 --> 01:31:14,219
Parole denied!
Take him back to his cell!

1209
01:31:14,392 --> 01:31:18,224
What colour are your nipples?
I bet they're pink! Light brown?

1210
01:31:18,396 --> 01:31:19,890
Dollar size or quarter?

1211
01:31:22,567 --> 01:31:24,939
Stan, did we win?

1212
01:31:25,111 --> 01:31:26,938
Let go of me. I'm in a hurry.

1213
01:31:27,113 --> 01:31:28,488
Have no fear, Stanley.

1214
01:31:28,656 --> 01:31:32,357
I will continue to take care
of your wife while you're gone.

1215
01:31:32,535 --> 01:31:35,157
- Thanks a lot, pal.
- No thanks needed.

1216
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:38,117
I cherish Mindy's company.

1217
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:42,205
Since my addiction to cigarettes
made me impotent,

1218
01:31:42,378 --> 01:31:45,415
I've had very little contact
with the fair sex.

1219
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:47,793
Impotent?

1220
01:31:47,967 --> 01:31:50,209
I used to think smoking was cool,

1221
01:31:50,386 --> 01:31:56,140
but a limp dick spells nerd
in any language.

1222
01:31:56,309 --> 01:31:59,345
- You're impotent. That's great!
- Not really.

1223
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,803
Baby, I love you.
I'll write to you as soon as I can.

1224
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:04,774
OK.

1225
01:32:07,987 --> 01:32:10,110
That's my boy.

1226
01:32:10,782 --> 01:32:12,241
Love you, baby!

1227
01:32:13,618 --> 01:32:16,323
- He's running!
- Code red!

1228
01:32:16,496 --> 01:32:18,868
Watch the prisoners file in.

1229
01:32:54,033 --> 01:32:55,907
The Master has taught you well.

1230
01:32:56,077 --> 01:32:59,612
Don't tell me.
You studied with The Master too?

1231
01:32:59,789 --> 01:33:04,498
- I am his number one.
- I didn't see that coming.

1232
01:33:04,669 --> 01:33:07,623
There are many things
you will not see coming.

1233
01:33:07,797 --> 01:33:10,371
Oh, really? Like what?

1234
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:20,972
Hmm.

1235
01:33:25,106 --> 01:33:29,982
- Whoa. Take it easy.
- I have been taking it easy.

1236
01:33:38,369 --> 01:33:40,943
I wanna break me off
some chocolate.

1237
01:33:41,122 --> 01:33:42,996
Come on, hold the line.

1238
01:33:44,918 --> 01:33:47,753
- Top you up here?
- Thank you very much.

1239
01:33:48,588 --> 01:33:50,746
How are you doing?

1240
01:33:50,924 --> 01:33:51,955
Yeah, good.

1241
01:34:07,315 --> 01:34:11,941
I don't think The Master
prepares you for this.

1242
01:34:17,033 --> 01:34:19,524
Here comes the eagle.

1243
01:34:51,192 --> 01:34:52,936
Are those weapons?

1244
01:35:00,869 --> 01:35:02,660
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

1245
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:05,538
Ah!

1246
01:35:09,502 --> 01:35:12,373
Somebody didn't strengthen
their titties.

1247
01:35:15,049 --> 01:35:16,460
Whoo!

1248
01:35:23,099 --> 01:35:24,677
It looks like a riot.

1249
01:35:47,874 --> 01:35:49,701
Whoo!

1250
01:35:53,171 --> 01:35:55,626
- I celebrated too early!
- Ah!

1251
01:36:08,144 --> 01:36:10,979
Warden, can't you do anything
to stop this?

1252
01:36:11,147 --> 01:36:15,311
Bullard, prepare to fire.

1253
01:36:46,558 --> 01:36:48,016
Whoo!

1254
01:36:48,184 --> 01:36:50,889
Whoo! Whoo!

1255
01:36:54,315 --> 01:36:55,596
Whoo!

1256
01:36:56,484 --> 01:36:58,062
Finger of death.

1257
01:37:05,285 --> 01:37:06,695
That's you.

1258
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:16,001
I don't know if The Master
prepared you for this.

1259
01:37:22,343 --> 01:37:24,087
Hoo!

1260
01:37:29,684 --> 01:37:33,267
- Ready to dance, motherfuckers?
- Handle your shit, bitch!

1261
01:37:33,438 --> 01:37:34,636
Fire at will.

1262
01:37:36,524 --> 01:37:37,687
Don't fight!

1263
01:38:30,203 --> 01:38:31,578
Why aren't you firing?

1264
01:38:39,712 --> 01:38:42,832
- Fire that weapon.
- I can't do it, boss.

1265
01:38:45,385 --> 01:38:47,543
Well, why the hell not?

1266
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,211
They're just dancing.

1267
01:38:59,607 --> 01:39:01,600
Give me that rifle.

1268
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,864
What the hell are you doing?

1269
01:39:09,993 --> 01:39:11,487
Restoring order.

1270
01:39:12,662 --> 01:39:15,200
They've clearly lost their minds.

1271
01:39:15,373 --> 01:39:17,200
Warden, it's over.

1272
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:21,210
Look at all these witnesses.

1273
01:39:21,379 --> 01:39:23,751
It's over, warden.

1274
01:39:28,052 --> 01:39:29,879
You did this to me.

1275
01:39:47,530 --> 01:39:50,531
- Where did that come from?
- What do you think I've been doing

1276
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:52,942
with The Master for the last six months?

1277
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,076
Thank God.

1278
01:39:55,246 --> 01:39:56,990
You did good with Dang.

1279
01:39:57,165 --> 01:39:59,952
But you're still
my number two student.

1280
01:40:00,126 --> 01:40:03,744
- Number two?
- She'll kick your ass.

1281
01:40:06,257 --> 01:40:08,297
I might like that.

1282
01:40:09,928 --> 01:40:12,253
Ready position!

1283
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:14,423
Focus!

1284
01:40:14,599 --> 01:40:16,342
Lock! Punch!

1285
01:40:16,518 --> 01:40:18,890
- Kick! Double punch!
- Yah!

1286
01:40:19,062 --> 01:40:21,813
Ready position!

1287
01:40:21,981 --> 01:40:23,938
Lock! Punch!

1288
01:40:24,108 --> 01:40:26,896
- Kick! Double punch!
- Yah!

1289
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:29,739
- It's time, Minton.
- Just a minute, warden.

1290
01:40:29,906 --> 01:40:32,658
Looks great, guys.
Thanks, Robbie.

1291
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:35,992
OK, everybody, I gotta go now.

1292
01:40:36,162 --> 01:40:40,076
I'll miss you too.

1293
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:43,784
I want you guys to be especially nice
to our newest inmate

1294
01:40:43,962 --> 01:40:47,496
and best disbarred lawyer
in the world, Lew Popper.

1295
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:50,509
- Welcome aboard!
- Lew!

1296
01:40:50,677 --> 01:40:55,006
- Is the ban on rape still in effect?
- I'm pretty sure.

1297
01:40:55,181 --> 01:40:57,470
Hey!

1298
01:40:57,642 --> 01:41:02,185
Permission to give Big Stan
a group hug.

1299
01:41:02,355 --> 01:41:04,348
- Permission granted.
- Come on, gang!

1300
01:41:12,448 --> 01:41:16,280
Hey, little homey,
thanks for giving me my teeth back.

1301
01:41:16,452 --> 01:41:19,868
My pleasure.

1302
01:41:24,669 --> 01:41:27,374
- Where you going, cracker?
- I'm going home, man.

1303
01:41:27,547 --> 01:41:31,414
- I think Big Stan is staying here.
- Oh, yeah?

1304
01:41:34,554 --> 01:41:35,669
Oh, shit!

1305
01:41:38,683 --> 01:41:41,388
I'm Big Stan.
No more rape.

1306
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:43,388
Aw, very creepy.

1307
01:41:44,689 --> 01:41:45,768
My cracker.

1308
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:48,430
Be good, huh?

1309
01:41:49,986 --> 01:41:52,144
Bye, Stan!

1310
01:41:52,947 --> 01:41:54,987
Hey. Hey.

1311
01:41:58,119 --> 01:41:59,150
Whoo!

1312
01:41:59,329 --> 01:42:02,863
- Big man.
- Bye, Big Stan.

1313
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:04,618
Say bye.

1314
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:11,878
Stan!

1315
01:42:14,427 --> 01:42:16,799
Sweetie.

1316
01:42:16,971 --> 01:42:18,928
Hey, handsome.

1317
01:42:19,098 --> 01:42:21,305
- Where's Mindy Junior?
- In the car.

1318
01:42:21,476 --> 01:42:24,560
- She's being kind of a brat.
- Isn't the nanny helping?

1319
01:42:24,729 --> 01:42:27,434
Yeah. I think he
still sneaks cigarettes.

1320
01:42:27,607 --> 01:42:30,312
Yeah? I'll talk to him.

1321
01:42:35,865 --> 01:42:38,617
Hi, precious. Hi, The Master.

1322
01:42:38,785 --> 01:42:41,406
- Say hello to your father, child.
- Hi.

1323
01:42:41,579 --> 01:42:44,948
- Rumour is you're sneaking smokes.
- Shh.

1324
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:49,327
- How's her technique?
- She stinks.

1325
01:42:49,504 --> 01:42:51,247
But so did you at first.

1326
01:42:51,422 --> 01:42:54,293
You sure? I don't remember that.

1327
01:42:54,467 --> 01:42:56,341
- Stan!
- OK, baby.

1328
01:42:56,511 --> 01:42:58,385
Let's go, sweetie!

1329
01:43:04,423 --> 01:43:15,217
