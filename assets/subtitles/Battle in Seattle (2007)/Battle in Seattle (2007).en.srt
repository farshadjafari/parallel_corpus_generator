1
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,840
While this movie is based on facts
real, the characters are fictitious.

2
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:48,472
1947 ... Near the end of
World War II.

3
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:51,931
23 nations signed the general agreement
of tariffs and trade.

4
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,159
The GATT.

5
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,597
Its purpose ...

6
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,158
Legalize and expand the trade
in the world.

7
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:01,847
Stability ... the sense of
global community was the key.

8
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:05,033
In five decades the GATT grew

9
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:09,005
and more members have joined creating
the World Trade Organization.

10
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,372
We're writing the Constitution
for a single global economy.

11
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:17,519
With 151 nations, the WTO monitors
90% of world trade.

12
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:22,252
Unlike the GATT to WTO can impose,
and achieve punish countries with its law.

13
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:29,648
With the expansion of free trade to
WTO seeks to help countries

14
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:32,411
with the benefit of the system
global trade.

15
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:35,410
It has very little to do with TRADE
and certainly that is NOT FREE.

16
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:39,337
It is a global system of government where
nothing is done and nothing is controlled.

17
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,847
It is simply used to open
country borders.

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,878
Large corporations are free
to operate anywhere.

19
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:48,282
Without being affected by the government or
by the people of the United Nations

20
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:53,210
And they say that the value of money
should govern human rights.

21
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:58,033
And the environment must be tied
the needs of commerce.

22
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,724
The WTO must be for governments.

23
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,118
Of clean air rules were for the sewer.

24
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:02,942
Cases of asthma increases.

25
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:05,901
GM foods,
are sold to consumers.

26
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:08,972
Banana growers crushed
by large corporations.

27
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,820
Despite the problems, the power of
WTO continues to grow.

28
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:18,301
At the last meeting in Seattle, new
WTO rules have been edited.

29
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:25,332
It is the tight control of
most areas of our lives!

30
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,643
For many, this meeting
has become a battle.

31
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,120
For the future.

32
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,154
Take this, man.

33
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:56,522
Jay, she turned up.

34
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:01,790
Wait.

35
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:08,960
Okay, you can shoot.

36
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,640
I will now get you.

37
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:18,601
All right, I got you.

38
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,788
You do not have much material to replace.

39
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,778
No, should have looked better.

40
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:28,758
Do not start with ideas.

41
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:33,844
It had been three times,
This never happened to me.

42
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,753
You have to be a bit
crazy to do this.

43
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:40,819
Wait for my signal fire,
right?

44
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:42,707
By the way, my name is Lou.

45
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,743
Jay.

46
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:52,229
- It is better than free coffee in prison.
- I will not under arrest at least until tomorrow.

47
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:10,357
- That was close?
- Yes, very close.

48
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:52,881
"BATTLE IN SEATTLE"

49
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:56,281
Tomorrow, the WTO will meet in Seattle.

50
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:59,450
It will be the largest trade meeting
Overall, already done.

51
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:02,419
Jimmy Hoffa, the union along with
the environmentalists and people of

52
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:06,604
Human Rights will meet in
Memorial Stadium with 45 thousand people.

53
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:13,502
More than 50 thousand demonstrators are
in the streets protesting against the WTO.

54
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,156
Since 1968, democratic conventions
and the police have been faced.

55
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:24,342
They fear the oppression this week
in Seattle, due to

56
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:29,334
WTO connection with the USA, in
trade in oil.

57
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,779
We have files that identify the most
of individuals civilians, with their photos.

58
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:36,566
And the reality makes us think.

59
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:40,423
We have a team of lawyers
which will be along with us over

60
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:43,847
this event.
- Very well, Jay!

61
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:51,945
The first, Django Mills, arrested on 4
different countries for damage caused.

62
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,071
Louis Philips.

63
00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:00,054
According to the investigation, accused of
involvement in events.

64
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:04,414
Engaged in racial demonstrations
black with violence.

65
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,415
Samanta Clayton,
has no criminal sheet.

66
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:09,288
Apparently, he studied law.

67
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:12,633
She was involved in a case
legal party in 1998.

68
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,745
And, finally, I know
Jay Aliguon.

69
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,043
We here in the lower part of
from the city center.

70
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,873
And each group will be one of those areas.
How are we doing?

71
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:26,124
- No violence.
- All right, and with conscience.

72
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:28,945
The brother of Jay died in a
demonstration in the forest.

73
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:33,101
My brother! You killed him!
You killed him!

74
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,995
An ambulance.

75
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:45,315
Since then involved in most
the demonstrations through the country

76
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:48,206
Including in the prisons of 1998.

77
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:51,051
Raise your hand all those who are
willing to be arrested me.

78
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,817
Do not feel bad about what the
others out there can say.

79
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,846
The ceremony will begin within
24 hours, prepare yourselves

80
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:04,500
because we shoot these
sons of bitches down!

81
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,887
All right!

82
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:11,119
All right!

83
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:14,711
We have that for two barricades
around the Paramount Theater.

84
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,914
We believe that all
protests are going to focus there.

85
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:23,422
Typically up with the
coaches and those who pass will be arrested.

86
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:27,513
I do not want prisons, but as president,
I want the city clean.

87
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:29,981
How many Protestants expect?

88
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,669
7 thousand, maybe 10 grand.

89
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,713
We are prepared for that.
- Sure.

90
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:43,079
The opening ceremony of the WTO will be
the Paramount Theater in the center.

91
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,325
Demonstrators human rights,
the representatives of trade unions

92
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:55,320
and environmental advocates, are already
prepared for the meeting in Seattle,

93
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:59,432
where 20 thousand demonstrators against
CMO combine the march.

94
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:05,178
- What happens to you?
- Still looking for a good story.

95
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,728
Nothing out of the ordinary.

96
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:23,018
Everything looks great.

97
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,518
It seems that baby will have a very
healthy, at least until now.

98
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,791
Have chosen the name?

99
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,164
No, not yet.
But a few like that, right?

100
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,709
She has some like that.

101
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:41,791
- I gotta go, baby
- Oh, do not go now.

102
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,487
I have things to do. Good luck.
These protests call me crazy.

103
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,974
Come on!
I call you.

104
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:55,522
Doctor, talking and this woman
because it makes me very happy.

105
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:58,409
Of course they raise.
- I see you later.

106
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:11,931
It took two years to
bring the WTO to Seattle.

107
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:13,818
And succeeded.

108
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:18,098
Hello, how are you?

109
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:23,064
Can I make one of our most
tough negotiators in the southern hemisphere.

110
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:26,605
I bet you did not tell the
cause of all this success.

111
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:34,147
The next cities are Detroit,
Denver, Dallas, San Diego and Honolulu ...

112
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:39,315
- I make him Dr. Alex of Boston.
- Nice to meet you.

113
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:40,149
Nice to meet you, too.

114
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,605
Vai talk about the costs of
some medicines.

115
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,970
I hope he has more luck in
his speech than I do.

116
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,548
I invite them to be more productive
and have a week of success.

117
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,279
- When success!
- Thanks!

118
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,620
Thank you all.

119
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:05,089
I invite them to the cocktail of
Feast of the WTO.

120
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:09,246
From where will come much better, but the
music will not be so good.

121
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:15,702
As president was in protest
against the war in Vietnam.

122
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,047
So I am happy that there may be
demonstrations of protests here.

123
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:24,852
And promised humanitarian organizations
that there would be no violence.

124
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:30,264
I think that plan remains
that the order shall prevail.

125
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:34,590
What I am saying is that
hard with their procedures.

126
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:38,611
But be gentle with
my city. Thank you.

127
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:47,852
Well .. Six months to plan ...
Here we go.

128
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,240
Tuesday, November 30.

129
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,897
- What time is it?
- I do not know.

130
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,803
Having spent the night?

131
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:34,661
Let me pass.

132
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,820
What?

133
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,191
Not much in the first morning.

134
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,863
Catch!

135
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,938
- In the event of chemical attack.
- What the fuck chemical attack?

136
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:07,592
I do not think there will be
chemical attack.

137
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:10,251
We will have more than,
a couple of guys out there.

138
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,783
- How is the baby?
- Good.

139
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:17,936
We did ultrasound yesterday, and you
you can see his body.

140
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,998
Even the little finger.

141
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,313
And to hear the beats of the heart.

142
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,467
Very fast.

143
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:31,185
As if saying:
Oh, Dad ... Oh, Dad ... Oh father ...

144
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,185
How are you involved in this?

145
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,013
- What are you, a cop?
- I am, please reply to my question.

146
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:42,013
How am an activist
joined me for a week.

147
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:46,279
When I thought,
we could all be equal.

148
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,202
- And now?
- I do not know.

149
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,497
Only after observing the enemy.

150
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,341
And you, sir? How do we put
the stick in the wet?

151
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:57,949
I put the stick in the sauce because I wanted
to make sure that no one is weighed.

152
00:12:58,183 --> 00:12:59,682
Of course, nobody is hurt.

153
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:00,935
Why does it?

154
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:03,041
You are strong, huh?

155
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,121
The protests thrills me and
depress me at the same time.

156
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,096
I do not know because it moves me.

157
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:10,834
Yeah, here we go for 15 minutes,
we will not wait for you.

158
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,138
No, sir!

159
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:16,199
Good luck out there.

160
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,199
Lucky? They do not need
of luck, if there is confusion.

161
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:22,513
Give me your arm.

162
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,106
Their number?

163
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:28,198
A lawyer to help her
If you go to the prison.

164
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:31,229
I thought you would
the number on my arm.

165
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:33,781
I think a number
is sufficient.

166
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:41,231
Okay, kids, talk less,
come, we have to go.

167
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:45,396
Come on.

168
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,920
- How was it yesterday?
- You gotta see this.

169
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,419
Look at this!

170
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:57,124
My God, we have to go shopping
for the baby, immediately.

171
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,903
We do not know the sex yet.

172
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:01,364
Look, the baby is already almost
being born.

173
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:03,559
We're just waiting, you know.

174
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:07,011
- So, it is boy or girl?
- We do not want to know.

175
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:10,611
- It is a police officer?
- Very funny.

176
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:15,377
Either way, I need you
behind the drum. Here everything.

177
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:18,918
- That speaks another language.
- Congratulations.

178
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,835
You guys are beautiful!

179
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:25,063
You are the people!

180
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:27,632
You are the power!

181
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:32,087
And we will show today,
who we are.

182
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,553
We are here today,
to protest.

183
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,710
We do not agree.

184
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:44,495
We are here today,
to divide them.

185
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,582
All right, bring.

186
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:13,865
Come, come, fast, fast.

187
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:21,600
They are on top of the fence.

188
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:25,361
Move, move.

189
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,978
Bring.

190
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:29,388
Protect your car,
protect the car.

191
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:42,135
- Jay, we installed here.
- Watch.

192
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:47,892
Nobody comes ... No one leaves ...
Nobody comes ... No one leaves.

193
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:54,987
We have already closed the Paramount.
How is it there?

194
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:56,434
I'm going now.

195
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:57,745
Okay, see you later.

196
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:17,125
Go, go, go.

197
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:29,824
Blocked.

198
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:18,413
Jane.

199
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:20,617
What is happening?

200
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:24,680
- Do you close the Paramount.
- What? Okay, we go there.

201
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:34,821
I need to go, please.

202
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:36,146
Go back to the hotel.

203
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,091
I am not the WTO.
The WTO can help us.

204
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,478
Sorry man,
but we can not.

205
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,237
No one leaves,
no one enters.

206
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:49,139
This could not happen.

207
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:56,491
- Sir, we have a delicate situation.
- What is happening out there?

208
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:57,650
Look at this place.

209
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,952
Delegates can not pass the
is protesters on the other side.

210
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:03,330
- And the police did not stop?
- No, sir.

211
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:04,624
And why not?

212
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:09,760
He gave no orders to arrest
Nobody outside the area of the barricades.

213
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,074
The police are to achieve
passage of delegates, but the

214
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:15,919
demonstrators are united.

215
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:17,743
What?

216
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:21,169
They made circles with his hands and
can not separate their arms.

217
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,748
Lord, the chief of police
is on line 1.

218
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:30,933
Gordon, I told not to leave
anyone passing by barricades.

219
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,548
We could not do anything.

220
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,433
Today the whole center
is a full one.

221
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:37,921
You tell them not arresting,
even if we wanted to.

222
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,090
- My thought was no violence.
- There has been experiencing violence.

223
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:45,275
- What do we do?
- I called the forces of the state.

224
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,962
By calling for firefighters
to stop the protest.

225
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,089
But they refused it.

226
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,196
- What options left, then?
- Only one option left.

227
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,317
Gordon.

228
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:58,613
I will not hurt people, hear?
I gave them my word.

229
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:03,368
Oh Jim, I think we have no choice.

230
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:04,565
Mr.

231
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,511
The White House on line 2.

232
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,237
Okay, okay.

233
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:19,347
Okay, do you have to do and
do it fast.

234
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,667
- Nervous, Johnson?
- Nervous?

235
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:35,552
Are you kidding me, man?

236
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:40,428
- With this shit I feel invincible.
- I used to feel that way.

237
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,894
We have new orders, listen up.

238
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,821
Are close to the theater and the order is
to use all the techniques.

239
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:49,396
No arrest is made,
realized?

240
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:54,914
So stick to the Protestants
suspend the law and we watch?

241
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,167
All right, Johnson,
come on up.

242
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,860
Therefore, we in groups of five,
are ready.

243
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:03,872
- You can tell because they are here today?
- Well, basically to defend the

244
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:09,107
species in danger of extinction that
require mechanisms to maintain them.

245
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:13,751
The WTO is using these
mechanisms for illegal manner.

246
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,874
Well, love of turtles
but we believe that there are problems

247
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:20,955
most important in the world that
must address.

248
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:25,027
Do you think the rules of
maintenance of species are

249
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:30,521
the same for employment,
and quality of the environment

250
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,154
or our food getting worse.

251
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,704
They just want to get their brands.

252
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:41,308
You think you can sign a
trade agreement, valid.

253
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:46,560
There is no problem in having trade
that respects human rights.

254
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:51,543
The interests of the WTO are illegal.
- Thanks, it was great.

255
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:54,089
Michael, is broken,
we will repair.

256
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:15,926
Louis?

257
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:19,180
Louis?

258
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,790
Louis.

259
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:27,188
- You are on fire.
- Turn back, come, come.

260
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,136
Open your eyes,
open your eyes.

261
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,637
Okay, everybody, listen up
I have heard.

262
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:43,922
The protests are happening
the boulevard in the city center.

263
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,088
and the police is already in the middle
of the protest.

264
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:51,047
So relax.
Make a snack.

265
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:57,981
207, please.

266
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:04,813
... must do everything to happen ...

267
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:13,362
Can you give me water? And whiskey.

268
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:15,072
Certainly.

269
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:50,509
- What?
- Sir, the governor on the line.

270
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:59,411
Governor? Yes, I have good news.
The White House has offered to negotiate,

271
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:04,306
with the demonstrators in the center.
- I have the secret service on top,

272
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:12,067
something must be done quickly,
Call the National Guard.

273
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:15,785
The protest is not violent,
if the National Guard,

274
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:19,651
the whole community is going to be alarmed.
- Jim, I have the secretary of state in

275
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:24,551
hotel and the White House to
pressing urgently.

276
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:28,399
I understand, but not now
can do anything. The police

277
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:33,629
is already in charge of the march.
We can not call the National Guard.

278
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:37,285
You can handle it?
Because we have a potential disaster.

279
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:40,464
John, please listen, okay?

280
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:43,793
Take some time to the police.
They are able.

281
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,215
- Give me just a few more hours.
- Okay, I give you two hours, that's all.

282
00:23:48,396 --> 00:23:52,197
Lord, the ceremony of the CMO should
be canceled.

283
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,369
Okay.

284
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:13,724
It worked! It worked!

285
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,833
Showed where we came from.

286
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:18,816
We throw them to the ground.

287
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,901
One of the biggest protest in history!

288
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:24,497
Do the neighbors joined us?
- It seems so, all the neighbors.

289
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:25,911
Come on ..

290
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:36,394
Do not go there, I need
you in the city center.

291
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:38,750
Say what you want and we do.

292
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,562
Not so, come down this path.

293
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:45,929
We are together for
same reason.

294
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:50,503
This is the strength of the union!
This is the strength of the union!

295
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:55,211
This is the strength of the union!
This is the strength of the union!

296
00:24:55,566 --> 00:25:00,159
This is the strength of the union!
This is the strength of the union!

297
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,252
Gordon, what is happening?
We made some progress out there?

298
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:12,752
The residents are marching,
with the demonstrators in the center.

299
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:15,565
Residents also the march?
How this happened?

300
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:17,837
- We do not know.
- How do we know?

301
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,410
You said you did not come
the Memorial Stadium.

302
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,111
I know!

303
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:23,500
Then find out what is
happen, right?

304
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:34,222
Fuck you!

305
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,578
The TV is to cover all
on the protest.

306
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:57,622
I am that I am pregnant,
let's get this too.

307
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:01,963
I will find something.
- Better be quick, I am ahead.

308
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:05,714
I am thinking in something different.
Lambada?

309
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:08,750
It is a dance.

310
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,526
- I met her in Brazil.
- Do not tell me that.

311
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:14,841
Was it three days walking.

312
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:19,309
Let the work, we travel
rather than do books.

313
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,635
Two weeks later, I discovered
I was pregnant.

314
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:23,839
Took me a promotion.

315
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:27,308
And never talked about it.

316
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:33,392
It is better to wait, you know?
- You do not wait, you have to try.

317
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:38,462
I feel like my life has changed,
and I am not ready for it.

318
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:43,872
Think you can find
something in this magazine?

319
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:50,355
You can win their
rights in law.

320
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:52,025
It can be great.

321
00:26:52,483 --> 00:26:58,111
- At least considered themselves the most.
- They have to do that.

322
00:26:58,246 --> 00:26:59,401
It would be better.

323
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:04,611
What are you doing?
This woman is pregnant!

324
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:08,347
Vai have a child? Think they
will like you, at this store

325
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:10,017
to buy clothes for babies?

326
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,357
Of course not.
- So do not buy here!

327
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:16,087
What is happening out there?

328
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,965
What the hell are you doing?

329
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,768
I do not promise anything.
- Good stop, you lose your head.

330
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:37,682
Are you going to get us arrested.

331
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:41,556
Are you kidding me?
You gonna throw out everything we planned.

332
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:42,775
Now, stop it!

333
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:48,371
And tomorrow? Want me to say peace, love,

334
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:50,494
and that use flowers against weapons?

335
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,329
The streets of Seattle, in the midst of chaos.

336
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:55,995
Several violent demonstrations.

337
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:57,119
Get out of my way.

338
00:27:58,452 --> 00:28:00,964
- What the hell are we waiting for?
- This is not a violent protest.

339
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:04,030
I am not being violent.
Did you see someone being hurt?

340
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,430
I am the attack on America?

341
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:06,868
That is not the point.

342
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:08,743
The meeting is to be avoided.

343
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,244
Exactly, that is us
let's make it famous.

344
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:15,573
Are you blind? Want
call it anarchy?

345
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,047
Calm down, if you do not want to call
the most attention, sweetie.

346
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,545
Stop.

347
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:23,743
Without violence, huh?

348
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,149
Fuck you!

349
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:26,892
Wake up!

350
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:28,338
Get away from me.

351
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:30,139
What do you know, huh?

352
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:32,682
Is trying to show?
Give them a hand, Jay.

353
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:36,291
You know nothing about me.
- I do not care for no man like you,

354
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:39,353
in my whole life. You are a
fucking coward, Jay.

355
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:43,593
- Lou! .. Lou!
- Fuck you!

356
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,240
Excuse me.

357
00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:50,869
Why do you think that violence is
best means this move?

358
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:53,075
You want to know my message?

359
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:56,525
I want you to stop passing information,
of corporations controllers

360
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:59,834
for the world, and begin to inform
that this world is being violated

361
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:02,666
for these guys to a
million years,

362
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:06,012
to see if the world begins
to fight. Put it on the news.

363
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:09,962
Cut ..

364
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:14,484
- Keep the tape?
- What do you think?

365
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,114
We will have to move us
upwards of civilians.

366
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,524
We have to use the gas to
rout the groups.

367
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:25,732
With groups or not, that is
a bad image to be amended.

368
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,042
Give me a reason not to
use the gas.

369
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:32,224
You will have to be like this guy!

370
00:29:32,442 --> 00:29:34,866
You can leave and move to
civilian clothes.

371
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,356
We have to walk and walk fast.

372
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:39,449
Come, come.

373
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:34,242
- Asked me a few hours and I gave.
- But there has been no violence.

374
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,541
There is no violence because
is not heard the news.

375
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:38,982
If he had called the National Guard,
as I said,

376
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:42,084
Seattle did not run,
All newspapers in the world.

377
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:45,512
We are trapped
by surprise, Jim.

378
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:48,199
Time to terms
the control again.

379
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:50,145
The National Guard does not
will be here until tomorrow.

380
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:52,948
And we can not expect that
this is an emergency situation.

381
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:54,770
There is only one option.

382
00:30:54,928 --> 00:30:57,803
Are you crazy? We can not do
center, an area of war.

383
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:00,126
This is the opinion Beirut.

384
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:12,082
It is 12 hours the president
the USA, is to land here.

385
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,993
Are already talking about canceling,
and this can not happen.

386
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,149
Understand?

387
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:25,167
So what is given back to
normal, is it not?

388
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,159
We agree?

389
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:40,775
The window broke and I was terrified.
I am still shaking.

390
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:45,799
Have you seen this?
- Yes, it does not seem normal.

391
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:49,026
- Can you feel?
- Yes

392
00:31:49,705 --> 00:31:52,868
- What is happening?
- Hello dear, where are you?

393
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,745
- At work.
- I want to go home now.

394
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,151
- You are a crazy at the center?
- You are.

395
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:06,022
You okay?

396
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:15,408
Due to protests are
to close immediately.

397
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:18,592
We apologize to all
customers. Thank you.

398
00:32:19,594 --> 00:32:20,514
Close everything.

399
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:31,011
We have to think in another submission.

400
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,680
Nobody came because
the protestors.

401
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:35,713
Sorry.

402
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,663
Good afternoon.

403
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:25,228
It is my duty to inform you that I am
calling the National Guard.

404
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:33,414
We are declaring a state of
emergency at Seattle

405
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,429
from this moment.

406
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,655
All measures will be imposed,
from 19 hours of today

407
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:42,647
until 7:30 hours of tomorrow
at the heart of Seattle.

408
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:46,977
These actions are to prevent
greater destruction.

409
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:52,179
It seems that were not
prepared for this event?

410
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,632
We have all the names of the demonstrators.

411
00:33:56,054 --> 00:34:00,857
And decided to continue with the speech and
continue with the event.

412
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:04,396
Mr. President, why the guard
National was not called before?

413
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:08,100
We thought that it was not need to use
the force until the situation worsened.

414
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:11,631
We did not want to make Seattle
as an army camp.

415
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:13,855
But the WTO has to work.

416
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:18,029
We saw the police violence on television.
- Yes, we have been protests.

417
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,067
The police have to answer
appropriately.

418
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:24,171
Thank you.

419
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:29,094
Mr. President, is to declare martial law
is not to violate human rights?

420
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:37,654
Wait.

421
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:50,319
Said that disperse,
or be victims of

422
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:52,916
application of chemical.

423
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:57,519
Comply immediately
to order.

424
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,458
We have the right to speak.

425
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:08,237
Immediately comply with the order,
there is no negotiation.

426
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:12,784
This is a totally passive protest.

427
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:14,813
Please meet the set.

428
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:07,106
Go ahead for me.

429
00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:39,069
There are no buses on the streets.

430
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:40,916
How will I go home?

431
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:45,226
Gabi, it is that I get
in your home for now?

432
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:53,198
Pinch me.

433
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,508
Prepare the gas.

434
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:05,303
Disperse.

435
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,272
Are you ready?
- Yes

436
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,230
Here, thanks.

437
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,538
Put this on.

438
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:19,584
- Do you have one?
- I have to do something.

439
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:22,538
All right, everybody, this is it.

440
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,270
Run, run, do not stop.
Run, run,

441
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:38,741
Power, power to the people!
Power, power to the people!

442
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:49,768
Power, power to the people!
Power, power to the people!

443
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:14,063
Launch.

444
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,939
- Shit ..
- Michael, come on.

445
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:43,410
Come on!

446
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,390
Crap.

447
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:51,757
Are you ready?

448
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:11,879
We see a violent attack
Police in central Seattle.

449
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:17,128
Help me.

450
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:18,258
My God!

451
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:25,156
What happened?

452
00:41:26,393 --> 00:41:28,278
My baby!

453
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:32,649
Michael! Michael!

454
00:42:55,178 --> 00:42:56,442
What about boys!

455
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:01,166
I'm on duty.
I'm on duty.

456
00:43:01,362 --> 00:43:02,910
Guys, let go.

457
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,334
Where were we are
wait for hours.

458
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,088
- What happened to your face?
- It's a long story.

459
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,980
- What the hell is that?
- We had to use, had no place.

460
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:17,958
Oh, that's great.

461
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:20,140
Crap!

462
00:43:20,656 --> 00:43:23,734
Without rest, without food.

463
00:43:23,956 --> 00:43:25,287
Sick.

464
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:31,467
Is coming!
Cheers demand!

465
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,105
Dale, his wife
is in the hospital.

466
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:48,335
Let's put the two.

467
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,139
The groups continue
to destroy property.

468
00:43:58,498 --> 00:44:01,905
The police can not control.

469
00:44:02,844 --> 00:44:06,078
An hour later, the group
is still in action.

470
00:44:06,294 --> 00:44:10,252
We had to close all
shops in the Christmas season.

471
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:13,797
It's really an injustice.

472
00:44:22,422 --> 00:44:24,983
The Battle in Seattle has become
in a war.

473
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,327
Jesus Christ.

474
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,904
Battle in Seattle?

475
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:33,545
Sounds like a show.

476
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:37,995
Dangerous acts of violence.

477
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,462
- And what do you expect?
- What do I expect?

478
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:43,910
Eight corporations waiting
the meeting, you know it.

479
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,576
For we doing this?

480
00:45:05,391 --> 00:45:06,158
Sorry.

481
00:45:11,532 --> 00:45:12,909
Jay, please.

482
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,498
- If you want to go again, then go.
- It is not fair.

483
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,175
It is hard for me.

484
00:45:20,437 --> 00:45:22,486
We're on the floor, see what
made us.

485
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:25,467
- We failed, Jay.
- Only if you drop failed.

486
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:26,499
Fuck.

487
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:30,051
I always wanted justice for
his brother, as you do.

488
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:31,533
I could not win this case.

489
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:35,369
- How do you know? You do not get.
- I knew that it had a chance.

490
00:45:35,464 --> 00:45:36,552
Like now.

491
00:45:47,254 --> 00:45:51,598
Okay, perhaps rightly, perhaps
have a chance now.

492
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,721
I understand if you do not want to do,
Part of the protest.

493
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:58,660
You could be the prescription.

494
00:45:59,813 --> 00:46:04,096
I know I can make a difference.

495
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:09,314
I do.

496
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,002
We have to stop those,
or does not stop anything.

497
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,335
Do not stop.

498
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,438
My wife?
- There it is.

499
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,225
You brought my wife, Ella?
What happened?

500
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:43,411
Was attacked by the police.

501
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:48,462
Thank you.

502
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:16,719
Ella.

503
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:24,646
Yes

504
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:26,969
How are you?

505
00:47:29,782 --> 00:47:30,625
What happened?

506
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:42,128
Okay.

507
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:45,379
Okay.

508
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:56,687
Get off me.

509
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,152
I am darling, it's me.

510
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:01,654
Get off me.

511
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,883
- Honey.
- No, no.

512
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:29,364
Wednesday, December 1.

513
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:41,732
Yesterday I thought that the protests
came from unions,

514
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,749
particularly against the WTO.

515
00:48:44,027 --> 00:48:45,532
But when the march of
unions was over,

516
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:47,540
the fighting in the streets
were on the increase

517
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:50,689
and the message of trade unions
so that everything was over.

518
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:53,063
- Last night ...
- ... more arrests were made.

519
00:48:53,857 --> 00:48:56,352
Many demonstrators incurred
in civil disobedience

520
00:48:56,673 --> 00:48:58,527
to be arrested.

521
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,836
The chief of police in Seattle said
at night, that he felt proud

522
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:04,261
of his men and
defended their actions.

523
00:49:04,548 --> 00:49:07,561
Our policemen under my command,
have a job

524
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:09,726
extraordinary today, against
all predictions.

525
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:13,769
Something tells me that no
will be as friendly as yesterday.

526
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:21,397
- Looks like going somewhere.
- You too.

527
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,794
- Jay.
- Yes

528
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:28,958
- Did?
- This will let you enter.

529
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,163
Not bad, huh?

530
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:33,122
- OK
- It is a bad time.

531
00:49:33,412 --> 00:49:35,642
- See you when I get back.
- Good luck.

532
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,937
I need more material,
to just 4 hours, no?

533
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:40,616
I do not care what
say the center, right?

534
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:45,131
- Lieutenant, you have a minute?
- Yes, of course, Dale.

535
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:49,587
Lord, I need permission
to go home.

536
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,413
I need to stay with my wife.

537
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,114
- Today.
- Yes, I heard what happened.

538
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,394
Sorry, I know that is a bad
moment for you.

539
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,053
But I need you in the streets.

540
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,757
Sir, I am not prepared
to leave today.

541
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:07,221
No, every man is
important out there.

542
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:13,355
Look, when this is over I will give him
any time you like, right?

543
00:50:22,998 --> 00:50:27,774
... not that their diseases
are incurable,

544
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,854
but because we have customers who
do not provide

545
00:50:32,165 --> 00:50:34,724
a viable market for
pharmaceuticals

546
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:40,446
I think the WTO should review
its trade agreements

547
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:45,735
so that the public health risks
before commercial interest.

548
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:49,653
It is vital for the survival of
million people.

549
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,842
Thank you.

550
00:50:57,224 --> 00:51:00,009
I am sure we all agree
that doctors without borders

551
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:01,681
have done much good.

552
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,710
However, this issue of the agreement,

553
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:05,885
think that is
a little cheated.

554
00:51:06,256 --> 00:51:08,696
- Who is this man?
- Is Mark Terrington

555
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:11,491
Member of a large group
the pharmaceutical industry.

556
00:51:11,812 --> 00:51:14,780
Many of these nations are surrounded
in bloody civil wars.

557
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:18,080
They have no basic infrastructure
as treated water,

558
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:19,760
and sewage treatment.

559
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:22,760
And this inevitably leads to
a health crisis.

560
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:25,814
no matter how much medicine
is available to them.

561
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:28,271
Doctor, your industry is
equal to ours.

562
00:51:28,582 --> 00:51:31,117
It is dedicated to maintaining and
to preserve health.

563
00:51:31,891 --> 00:51:33,590
Thank you.

564
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:41,036
Descul ... Descul ..

565
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,357
Excuse me!

566
00:51:45,988 --> 00:51:50,565
I just wanted to congratulate the WTO and
particularly to Mr. Lowe.

567
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:57,370
For the effort of Mr. Lowe and WTO
not to remove the trees.

568
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:01,329
Producers loggers destroyed
2 million hectares of forest.

569
00:52:01,607 --> 00:52:05,266
Trees were irreplaceable
converted into greed.

570
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:10,370
I just want you to know that the blood of
my brother is on his head.

571
00:52:11,204 --> 00:52:13,298
On its head,
son of a bitch!

572
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,525
Fucking killer!

573
00:52:17,228 --> 00:52:19,362
No! My brother was injured!
My brother was injured!

574
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,764
Murdered my brother!

575
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:23,962
Call an ambulance.

576
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,786
Call an ambulance.

577
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,858
Have you ever imagined how these
horses must feel,

578
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:27,756
stopped there? I could ask.

579
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:31,323
No, but how you,
is always optimistic.

580
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,755
Animals, working with animals
instead of humans.

581
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,467
Much healthier.

582
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:37,501
The next time you are saving
Turtles should come with you.

583
00:53:37,778 --> 00:53:39,232
- I think like that.
- Really?

584
00:53:40,015 --> 00:53:41,166
Why turtles?

585
00:53:41,808 --> 00:53:44,343
When I was a kid my grandfather
told me a beautiful story.

586
00:53:44,673 --> 00:53:47,117
About all the animals were
taken by a turtle.

587
00:53:47,384 --> 00:53:49,313
What was different, you know?

588
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:51,994
Could not defend, and then
everyone enjoyed it.

589
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:54,377
But the turtle was smart.

590
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,171
Then developed a hard shell.

591
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:59,927
And that enfureceu the other animals,
so caught,

592
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:02,029
and lances to the river

593
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:04,947
and broke the hull in a dozen
to pieces.

594
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,341
- Poor turtle.
But she was right.

595
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:09,239
It was strong, you know? She got up,

596
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:13,910
calmed, even knowing
that the hull was cracked.

597
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:16,487
Was stronger than ever.

598
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,198
That is why the turtles are
these beautiful designs in the hull.

599
00:54:20,983 --> 00:54:22,384
And what happened?

600
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:27,081
Well, because the WTO, the hull
has become an ashtray.

601
00:54:28,914 --> 00:54:30,964
Fuck you, Django.

602
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,356
It is a world fucked.

603
00:54:34,345 --> 00:54:35,779
Let me understand this.

604
00:54:36,058 --> 00:54:37,576
Yesterday we should not arrest anyone.

605
00:54:37,988 --> 00:54:39,699
And today we should arrest everyone.

606
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:42,896
Johnson, give order to disperse.

607
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:44,979
If you do not disperse, arrest them

608
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,269
Got it?

609
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,263
Stay in line, come on.

610
00:55:03,022 --> 00:55:04,539
Honey, I am.

611
00:55:06,573 --> 00:55:08,814
I just wanted to say ...

612
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,577
I do not know what it meant.

613
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:15,684
Dale, we are going in front.
Come on, come on.

614
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:18,377
Gotta go.

615
00:55:19,245 --> 00:55:21,235
Try to connect later.

616
00:55:22,482 --> 00:55:24,062
I love you, baby.

617
00:55:25,709 --> 00:55:28,382
The story is larger than some
few people

618
00:55:28,682 --> 00:55:30,773
dressed in black, from the windows.

619
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:34,600
Eric, the news is right here,
I am telling you.

620
00:55:36,177 --> 00:55:38,000
Eric listen to me, listen to me.

621
00:55:38,063 --> 00:55:39,407
No, you listen Jane.

622
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,459
Clinton in an hour,
will give a press conference.

623
00:55:41,528 --> 00:55:42,491
Vai speak live.

624
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:44,928
If this gozares with us
we have major problems.

625
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,186
- Understand?
- Yes

626
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:48,437
- Cu great.
- What do we do?

627
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:51,852
We will stay here
a little more.

628
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:58,254
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

629
00:55:58,637 --> 00:56:00,501
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

630
00:56:00,998 --> 00:56:04,061
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

631
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:08,008
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

632
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:13,054
This is the last warning!

633
00:56:13,734 --> 00:56:15,177
I need you to disperse!

634
00:56:15,488 --> 00:56:18,663
Get out, or we will force them
to go out.

635
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:23,067
I will not repeat again.
I need to rise and leave.

636
00:56:23,653 --> 00:56:25,468
Get ready!

637
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,037
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

638
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:35,893
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

639
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:39,774
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

640
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:43,856
Peaceful protest!
Peaceful protest!

641
00:56:44,206 --> 00:56:47,424
- Peaceful protest!
- Up!

642
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:58,723
Get up!

643
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:10,259
Take the knee of my neck,
I can not stand.

644
00:57:10,516 --> 00:57:11,652
Shut up!

645
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:14,405
This is a peaceful protest!

646
00:57:26,828 --> 00:57:28,635
Fuck you!

647
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:53,081
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

648
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:57,113
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

649
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,940
Why continue?

650
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:35,454
What?

651
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,189
I do not understand why
continue to risk that.

652
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:40,519
For a cause that
can not win.

653
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:43,016
Because they believe that
can win.

654
00:58:50,897 --> 00:58:52,373
Stop the van.

655
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,329
Jean, the conference of the Clinton
is in 5 minutes.

656
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,950
- Michael, I need you to forget the Clinton administration.
- Forget the live transmission?

657
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:03,917
No, let's go live.

658
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:06,258
You know what that means,
right?

659
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:10,909
President Clinton came to Seattle,
the middle of the night.

660
00:59:11,311 --> 00:59:14,032
We now know that the secret service,
thought to cancel the trip

661
00:59:14,341 --> 00:59:16,858
to be sure that the
president would be safe.

662
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:19,393
Already in a row with Jane Asbury
to report live

663
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:21,423
the conference's chairman.

664
00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:23,229
We are ready to enter.

665
00:59:25,989 --> 00:59:27,539
Are you sure you want
do this?

666
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:29,743
They do not want to know the truth?

667
00:59:30,022 --> 00:59:31,261
So will it be.

668
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:34,766
Now the battle to live
in Seattle.

669
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,593
By Jane live.

670
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:43,861
What the hell do you think it,
are you doing?

671
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:46,670
Cut the transmission and passes
for the studio.

672
00:59:46,946 --> 00:59:48,452
- What, now?
- Now!

673
00:59:51,082 --> 00:59:53,328
Well, this was the Jane Asbury
live from Seattle,

674
00:59:53,605 --> 00:59:57,317
to show the tactics that
demonstrators are to use.

675
00:59:57,936 --> 00:59:59,926
Back in five, after a pause.

676
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:10,240
I just wanted to say ...

677
01:00:12,887 --> 01:00:14,274
Thank you.

678
01:00:14,585 --> 01:00:16,442
She will call you.

679
01:00:41,484 --> 01:00:44,231
The creation of the African group
is essential,

680
01:00:44,581 --> 01:00:48,446
if we are to maintain a united voice
against industrialized nations.

681
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:52,261
What is happening?

682
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:56,158
- Where do you go?
- Sorry, Mr. Abassi,

683
01:00:56,384 --> 01:00:57,962
but because of a meeting
scheduled with the unions,

684
01:00:58,415 --> 01:01:00,188
we need all
interpreters available.

685
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,507
A meeting with the union,
is more important than us?

686
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:04,965
As hosts reserve the
right to determine,

687
01:01:05,243 --> 01:01:07,027
as our resources
will be distributed.

688
01:01:07,345 --> 01:01:09,795
We can get to
are here in another hour.

689
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:20,014
... much criticism on the WTO and how
we can improve what we do.

690
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:23,057
One criticism is that we will not accept:

691
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:27,253
That somehow not
We are democratic.

692
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,862
We have ministers of all
parts of the world.

693
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:33,369
Ministers who were chosen
by their chairmen.

694
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:36,175
Or elected to power.

695
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:53,492
90% of all deaths and suffering
by infectious diseases

696
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,574
occur in the 3rd world.

697
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,804
14 million people die
each year.

698
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,920
Many could be saved if the
drugs were cheaper.

699
01:02:05,372 --> 01:02:07,426
But they are too expensive,

700
01:02:08,415 --> 01:02:10,920
so that the nations in
the development custeiem

701
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:14,356
due to the laws of protection,
due to other laws ...

702
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,657
Stop, please! Stop!

703
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:18,626
You do not have children.

704
01:02:22,478 --> 01:02:25,590
How would feel if your child
were sick?

705
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:29,581
Knowing that there is a cure,
but can not pay it.

706
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:34,962
Then, they must be stopped
to see your son die?

707
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,604
You, right here.

708
01:02:42,336 --> 01:02:44,150
You have the power

709
01:02:44,462 --> 01:02:47,648
to make a difference.
It is no longer time for people

710
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:51,565
have more value than the profit?

711
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:13,872
It's the same music corrupt.

712
01:03:14,202 --> 01:03:16,173
All sing note for note.

713
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:17,686
Do not worry.

714
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,029
Be happy.

715
01:03:20,669 --> 01:03:22,851
Do not worry, be happy now.

716
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,677
Come on!

717
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:32,142
That is, is still the same world,
we're just stuck.

718
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:34,433
At least the world is still the same.

719
01:03:35,185 --> 01:03:37,161
What is wrong with you?

720
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:40,468
Something wrong
between you and Jay, right?

721
01:03:41,663 --> 01:03:43,580
- What do you mean?
- Oh, you know, Django knows.

722
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:46,303
I realize me everything.

723
01:03:47,095 --> 01:03:49,624
- I saw how he looked at you, baby.
- What looked?

724
01:03:49,985 --> 01:03:52,159
That look, you know.

725
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,753
In other words, had not seen the look
a girl so long ago.

726
01:03:54,884 --> 01:03:57,388
- I did not see any look!
- Okay, so I have not seen.

727
01:03:57,728 --> 01:04:00,645
Maybe it was the teargas and
those things that affect your eyes.

728
01:04:02,266 --> 01:04:04,437
About the arrested trying to
save you and Sam.

729
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:06,644
Good, because he can not
be arrested.

730
01:04:07,036 --> 01:04:10,233
- God, was close.
- Yes, love.

731
01:04:10,611 --> 01:04:13,550
If it were arrested had gone.

732
01:04:13,878 --> 01:04:15,385
What do you mean, gone?

733
01:04:15,745 --> 01:04:17,633
He already has two cases
against him.

734
01:04:17,964 --> 01:04:20,520
One more and is out of here.

735
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:22,964
I mean, life.

736
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:25,459
It is not funny! Do not you say?

737
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:28,315
- No, he did not tell me.
- Oh, it's true.

738
01:04:28,677 --> 01:04:31,460
1998, 1997.

739
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,656
In the forest.

740
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:36,812
Almost ran out of the balls.

741
01:04:37,946 --> 01:04:39,927
Even balls that are organic.

742
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:43,120
San balls!

743
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:46,111
Come on!

744
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:53,423
The police were in
center again,

745
01:04:53,774 --> 01:04:57,354
mixed with the demonstrators and
residents on Broadway and Pine streets.

746
01:05:00,215 --> 01:05:02,175
Finally the patience
Police eventually.

747
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,290
And the battle begins on Capitol Hill.

748
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,360
Police recover Capitol Hill.

749
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:15,030
And some say it was with
Tear gas,

750
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:17,238
and rubber bullets that
have lost their credibility.

751
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:21,868
For many of the violent climate battle
on Capitol Hill, was the strongest.

752
01:05:22,365 --> 01:05:24,437
Get ready for long vacations.

753
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,986
The latter group was pushed
from the Paramount Theater

754
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:35,626
Pine on the street, even outside of Capitol Hill.

755
01:05:36,752 --> 01:05:38,318
Fuck you, boy! What the hell!

756
01:05:38,885 --> 01:05:40,444
Son of a bitch!

757
01:05:42,196 --> 01:05:43,660
Crap!

758
01:05:44,558 --> 01:05:46,868
He was mijado.

759
01:05:47,178 --> 01:05:49,722
- What the fuck!
- Go upstairs!

760
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:52,756
Go upstairs!

761
01:05:53,259 --> 01:05:56,723
- Get out! Go!
- Son of a bitch!

762
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,751
Get back!

763
01:06:06,585 --> 01:06:08,825
Where the hell is all staff?

764
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,762
You started the violence!

765
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,548
This was a peaceful protest!

766
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:19,887
- Come on!
- Back off!

767
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:22,176
They are proud of yourselves?

768
01:06:22,589 --> 01:06:24,909
Come on, damn cowards!

769
01:06:26,974 --> 01:06:29,159
They think they are very brave?

770
01:06:30,973 --> 01:06:33,773
Dale, what are you doing, man?
What do you have?

771
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,192
- I do my job.
- Come on, he is a child!

772
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,598
You threw in his own son?

773
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:45,670
You shoot on your child or
use a knife?

774
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,002
- Get this.
- What?

775
01:06:50,692 --> 01:06:52,539
Dale, who the hell are you doing?

776
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:12,537
Hold on!

777
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:14,662
- I'm not working.
- What?

778
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:17,138
Open the door!

779
01:07:19,868 --> 01:07:20,968
Son of a bitch!

780
01:08:00,947 --> 01:08:02,127
Get up!

781
01:08:03,177 --> 01:08:04,664
Let him go!
Let him go!

782
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:06,406
Let him go!
Let him go!

783
01:08:07,055 --> 01:08:09,313
Look at me!
Let him go!

784
01:08:14,273 --> 01:08:15,523
You okay?

785
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,698
Look at me,
Look at me.

786
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:21,275
Rest a little.

787
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:24,367
I do not gift,
I am not present.

788
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,729
Can you walk?

789
01:08:28,193 --> 01:08:31,020
I do not gift,
I am not present.

790
01:08:31,863 --> 01:08:33,772
Get up, come on.

791
01:08:59,645 --> 01:09:01,305
Turn your back.

792
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:03,850
From back, please.

793
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,255
Open your arms.

794
01:09:34,647 --> 01:09:37,379
Thursday, December 2

795
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:13,248
Where will all the staff?

796
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:19,139
There are hundreds of our prisoners,
not believe them?

797
01:10:20,606 --> 01:10:22,553
This is not done yet!

798
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:25,873
We can not leave them there,
but are to rot.

799
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:27,842
What do you think we can do?

800
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:36,665
Look, I will ask for a hamburger!

801
01:10:37,554 --> 01:10:40,182
- Lawyers are here?
- It was what I heard.

802
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,853
Who will take us from here?

803
01:10:43,783 --> 01:10:45,390
Anybody here know Jay?

804
01:10:46,967 --> 01:10:48,968
Nobody saw him.

805
01:10:49,505 --> 01:10:51,112
So let us talk,
with someone from outside

806
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,999
we will not have idea with
what we're dealing with.

807
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,175
Its portfolio.

808
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:02,030
I need for cigarettes and
phone too.

809
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:04,987
All personal items
to be delivered, we will.

810
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:09,392
Stop on your right.

811
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,824
What the fuck are you looking at?

812
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:23,199
Excuse me, can do a
phone call?

813
01:11:23,475 --> 01:11:25,487
- No, sit down.
- I got the number right here.

814
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:27,530
You know what 'no' mean?

815
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:29,074
A call?

816
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,380
When you decide to say your name
then give their rights.

817
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:37,527
Jay?

818
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:38,457
Jay!

819
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:39,396
Jay!

820
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,008
What the fuck did he?

821
01:11:41,772 --> 01:11:43,565
His damned pigs!

822
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,092
Ms. Clayton, the president
will see you now.

823
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,639
Take a chair.

824
01:11:56,411 --> 01:11:59,259
It has a great responsibility
dealing with ... how many?

825
01:11:59,537 --> 01:12:02,052
- 600 people?
- 600 innocent people, Mr. President.

826
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:06,322
I am the first to admit
who make mistakes.

827
01:12:06,971 --> 01:12:09,725
But these demonstrators are
in prison because they broke through the law.

828
01:12:10,002 --> 01:12:13,042
We know they are arrested
people without trial.

829
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:22,387
This is an archive of
demonstrators, who are in prison.

830
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:30,448
If you agree, for 2 years,
not participate in the demonstrations,

831
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:32,139
will be released immediately.

832
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:36,662
Never agree to take,
civil liberties acquired.

833
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,962
Not me, Mr. President.

834
01:12:38,963 --> 01:12:40,814
I think I should give them an option,

835
01:12:40,907 --> 01:12:42,874
considering the consequences.
- What exactly are?

836
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:45,095
Its customers are in a
precarious situation,

837
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,231
especially those with
criminal chips.

838
01:12:52,893 --> 01:12:55,718
First of all, the rules of
the country were raped,

839
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:58,462
not giving access to prisoners
to their lawyers.

840
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:00,783
Second, access to lawyer
is not subject,

841
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,268
to meet with the police
questions as: What is your name?

842
01:13:03,558 --> 01:13:06,091
And finally, you do not have
resources to achieve a jury

843
01:13:06,402 --> 01:13:08,863
and public defender for each
them in that prison.

844
01:13:09,101 --> 01:13:10,440
Therefore, we will not do more bluff.

845
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,244
I want my clients
be released without fines;

846
01:13:12,516 --> 01:13:15,040
no orders for compensation,
and without charges.

847
01:13:15,317 --> 01:13:17,617
It's hard to help their customers
if they do not speak.

848
01:13:17,904 --> 01:13:20,317
Their voices must have been taken
and took their rights.

849
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:22,259
You're kidding.

850
01:13:22,577 --> 01:13:23,670
I want to see the prisoners now.

851
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:26,104
I suggest you go back in two days
when more calm.

852
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:27,977
Thank you.

853
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,460
Do not think that will
It was very calm.

854
01:13:50,277 --> 01:13:52,131
Especially for you, Mr. President.

855
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:54,484
Thank you.

856
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:03,906
Ella, Dale on the phone again.

857
01:14:06,237 --> 01:14:08,537
Say that again and within 2 days.

858
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,634
Jay, are you okay?

859
01:14:42,823 --> 01:14:45,625
Looks like it was worth it,
after all.

860
01:14:46,503 --> 01:14:47,924
It is true.

861
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,014
- Sorry.
- Everything is fine.

862
01:14:58,685 --> 01:15:00,447
I did not know.

863
01:15:04,597 --> 01:15:06,066
What?

864
01:15:08,113 --> 01:15:09,660
Everything is fine.

865
01:15:12,194 --> 01:15:14,636
I did not know you were
in you too.

866
01:15:14,904 --> 01:15:17,659
- What?
- That voice.

867
01:15:18,823 --> 01:15:21,082
That you do not stay and fight.

868
01:15:22,547 --> 01:15:24,978
All that is beautiful is
caught you.

869
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,934
I just wanted to escape.

870
01:15:43,898 --> 01:15:45,510
I feel so much.

871
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,865
Give me your hand.

872
01:16:04,879 --> 01:16:08,201
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

873
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:10,254
Crying like a baby.

874
01:16:16,544 --> 01:16:17,998
Come on, girl hard.

875
01:16:25,787 --> 01:16:27,835
- You are not alone!
- You are not alone.

876
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,891
The people are protesting with us!

877
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,105
The people are protesting with us!

878
01:16:32,456 --> 01:16:36,624
- In 30 cities in the world in contact.
- In 30 cities in the world in contact.

879
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,022
All we are with you!

880
01:16:50,693 --> 01:16:52,487
Until they are released!

881
01:16:52,849 --> 01:16:55,602
The people united will never be defeated!

882
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:58,708
The people united will never be defeated!

883
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:02,028
There they are!

884
01:17:23,517 --> 01:17:25,567
The people united will never be defeated!

885
01:17:25,836 --> 01:17:27,817
The people united will never be defeated!

886
01:17:28,178 --> 01:17:30,672
The people united will never be defeated!

887
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:37,747
Friday, December 3

888
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:50,731
Sorry Mr.
I think I would like to connect the TV.

889
01:17:51,236 --> 01:17:52,906
Channel 7

890
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,908
And increasing the protests in prison.

891
01:18:09,794 --> 01:18:11,380
How are you going?

892
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:21,842
I came to apologize to me.

893
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,181
I passed the line.

894
01:18:32,222 --> 01:18:33,998
My wife and I lost
our baby.

895
01:18:34,956 --> 01:18:37,309
I know that is no excuse, but it's just ...

896
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,009
Really sorry.

897
01:18:42,309 --> 01:18:44,352
Really, really, sorry.

898
01:18:48,293 --> 01:18:49,699
Sorry.

899
01:18:55,975 --> 01:18:57,634
I do not blame you.

900
01:19:00,604 --> 01:19:02,369
I mean, I blame, but ...

901
01:19:05,595 --> 01:19:07,685
This is not the problem.

902
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,634
You just was doing
his work, I suppose.

903
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:15,605
Many people were
trying to fight.

904
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:19,525
You know, there are many who
like to destroy.

905
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:24,979
They touch so many lives.

906
01:19:27,032 --> 01:19:30,021
Not only one, but millions.

907
01:19:30,744 --> 01:19:32,703
And nobody Ihes pointing a gun.

908
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:36,442
They seem so unbelievable.

909
01:19:38,925 --> 01:19:41,027
Untouchables.

910
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:47,374
We screwed,

911
01:19:49,355 --> 01:19:51,963
you and me is that we must fight

912
01:19:57,873 --> 01:19:59,847
... thousands of protesters
still in front of the prison ...

913
01:20:05,688 --> 01:20:06,687
Mr.

914
01:20:06,907 --> 01:20:09,409
The lawyer of the unions is
to threaten a general strike

915
01:20:09,502 --> 01:20:11,024
if the demonstrators did not
are released.

916
01:20:11,115 --> 01:20:14,147
- Greve general?
- Yes, sir.

917
01:20:15,998 --> 01:20:19,736
... the demonstrators demanding the release
of the 500 people arrested ...

918
01:20:28,874 --> 01:20:30,732
Tell me that I see evil.

919
01:20:31,802 --> 01:20:33,373
You are not here.

920
01:20:36,981 --> 01:20:38,301
You okay?

921
01:20:40,004 --> 01:20:41,716
Let's get out of here.

922
01:20:43,076 --> 01:20:44,873
Do not worry, we'll leave.
What? What?

923
01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:47,675
- What Django always says?
- I do not know.

924
01:20:47,942 --> 01:20:49,117
Come on! What Django always say?

925
01:20:49,364 --> 01:20:50,745
No.

926
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,293
Slow and steady wins the
race, ever.

927
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:56,682
What the fuck you want, Django?

928
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,715
Look around you, man.

929
01:21:05,188 --> 01:21:06,478
I know it's tough now.

930
01:21:08,242 --> 01:21:10,232
But you have to remain strong, man.

931
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:14,599
His brothers out there fighting for you.

932
01:21:14,901 --> 01:21:16,444
Fighting for us all.

933
01:21:16,814 --> 01:21:18,442
Come on, man.

934
01:21:23,153 --> 01:21:26,753
Moreover, to a week ago
nobody knew what the WTO was.

935
01:21:27,638 --> 01:21:29,082
Now ...

936
01:21:30,104 --> 01:21:31,837
still do not know what the WTO is, but ...

937
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,093
At least you know who is bad, you know?

938
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:46,931
How long we are trying to
save this planet?

939
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:52,972
- Not so long ago.
- It is still a mess, eh?

940
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,294
Oh, yeah.

941
01:23:01,232 --> 01:23:03,244
I love you.

942
01:23:21,878 --> 01:23:24,562
Earlier this week,
came here with the hope

943
01:23:25,354 --> 01:23:28,137
in our hearts to try
find better solutions

944
01:23:28,477 --> 01:23:30,190
for our country.

945
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:34,109
Promised that this meeting
would be different from last time.

946
01:23:34,624 --> 01:23:36,829
That our concerns
would be heard.

947
01:23:37,832 --> 01:23:40,212
We will not be
treated like animals.

948
01:23:42,377 --> 01:23:44,691
The manipulation of the countries
the 3rd World

949
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:47,163
is simply another way
of colonialism!

950
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:52,912
They may try to silence me,
but I have to continue to say:

951
01:23:54,025 --> 01:23:57,355
Let the demonstrators
outside are heard!

952
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,915
We have been blind and marginalized,
on matters of vital importance.

953
01:24:03,728 --> 01:24:06,171
Honesty and openness
does not exist here.

954
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:09,078
So we have reached a
consensus required

955
01:24:09,337 --> 01:24:11,193
to meet the target
this conference.

956
01:24:11,638 --> 01:24:13,412
We will not be doing nothing

957
01:24:13,803 --> 01:24:16,112
while our countries
are abused and exploited!

958
01:24:27,243 --> 01:24:29,599
The people united will never be defeated!

959
01:24:29,948 --> 01:24:32,844
The people united will never be defeated!

960
01:24:33,887 --> 01:24:36,930
- All from within!
- All from within!

961
01:24:37,352 --> 01:24:41,270
- We have two messages for you!
- We have two messages for you!

962
01:24:41,723 --> 01:24:45,361
- And we think will like!
- And we think will like!

963
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:48,188
- The first message says:

01:24:49,012 --> 01:24:52,293

965
01:24:52,591 --> 01:24:56,108
- The WTO talks!
- The WTO talks!

966
01:24:57,571 --> 01:24:59,913
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

967
01:25:04,776 --> 01:25:07,571
Little by little!
I told you!

968
01:25:07,981 --> 01:25:11,209
World Trade Organization.

969
01:25:11,827 --> 01:25:14,488
We are back to 18 hours
with more breaking news.

970
01:25:19,023 --> 01:25:22,036
- Second message:
- Second message:

971
01:25:22,366 --> 01:25:25,654

- You will like this, Jay

972
01:25:26,932 --> 01:25:31,738
- All prisoners will be released!
- All prisoners will be released!

973
01:25:32,108 --> 01:25:33,758
Oh, good!

974
01:26:02,747 --> 01:26:04,595
Where you going in such a hurry?

975
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,354
Gotta go.

976
01:26:14,157 --> 01:26:15,962
Do you run?

977
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,303
See you in the coming year.
April 16.

978
01:26:38,324 --> 01:26:40,045
All right!
Drink for me!

979
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:47,379
What the hell are you doing here?

980
01:26:49,483 --> 01:26:51,287
I am happy to see you too.

981
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,012
A below and a million ahead.

982
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:48,000
Governments will never be
caught up with the defense low.

983
01:27:48,195 --> 01:27:51,195
Two miles of areas excluded
return to international meetings

984
01:27:51,196 --> 01:27:53,196
as the WTO and the G8,

985
01:27:53,197 --> 01:27:56,197
giving people oppressed,
the right to disagree.

986
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,400
The WTO recognizes that access to
essential medicines should

987
01:28:02,401 --> 01:28:05,401
precedence over commercial interests.

988
01:28:08,497 --> 01:28:12,618
The WTO agrees that they should meet
the needs of the poorest countries.

989
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:20,300
Developing countries emerged,
after it has become clear,

990
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:24,101
that the real program is
expand the model broke the WTO.

991
01:28:25,828 --> 01:28:27,811
Lee Hyung Kae, leader
Federation of Korean

992
01:28:28,098 --> 01:28:29,675
Association's
Advanced Farmers,

993
01:28:29,881 --> 01:28:32,344
sacrificed for itself in protest.

994
01:28:36,236 --> 01:28:39,736
While the WTO floods,
local markets with imports,

995
01:28:39,737 --> 01:28:43,237
40,000 Indian farmers committed
suicide to escape their debts.

996
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,700
Over 36 million people in
contact in the world are part of

997
01:28:47,701 --> 01:28:51,701
largest protest in history against
war in Iraq.

998
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:00,849
By 2007, little progress has been
made regarding the promises

999
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:04,250
in Doha, including access to
essential medicines.

1000
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,500
Market in poor countries,
have not been met.

1001
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:16,800
Millions of jobs of the U.S.A.
are abroad, wages fall,

1002
01:29:16,801 --> 01:29:20,301
and imports of food
contaminated climb.

1003
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:25,600
But that has not stopped the people, to try
make another world possible.

1004
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,115
Everywhere

1005
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,600
The battle continues ...
