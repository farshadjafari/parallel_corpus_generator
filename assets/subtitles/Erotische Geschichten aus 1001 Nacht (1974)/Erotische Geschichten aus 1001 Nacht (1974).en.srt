1
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:10,504
ARABIAN NIGHTS

2
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:54,912
Truth lies not in one dream,
but in many dreams

3
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:03,253
Who will bid for this slave,
the Lady of Moons?

4
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:07,705
She will give the best massages
you have ever had

5
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:09,912
...head massages to bring
sweet sleep...

6
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:13,973
leg massages to make you
skip like a goat

7
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:15,795
As the poet says...

8
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:23,192
She is worth more than wise men.
She tends to the heads of kings

9
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:26,226
-Five hundred dinars
-Six hundred

10
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:27,242
Seven hundred

11
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:32,001
You hear Lady of Moons?
Seven hundred

12
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,691
-Shall he own you?
-I don't want a monkey-beard

13
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,823
I'll buy her. Eight hundred

14
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:43,723
You've only one eye. You must be bad
and God's punished you

15
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:46,086
How dare you insult me!

16
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:48,688
You dare to let her do that?

17
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:53,771
I can't help it. Her owner has given
her the right to choose her buyer

18
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,072
A thousand dinars

19
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:00,068
Will you accept this old man
as your owner, Zumarud?

20
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:07,406
Your candle is soft. It rises when
you sleep, falls when you rise

21
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:12,383
May the Lord have mercy on the
woman who lies with you

22
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:17,337
How dare you bring a slave here
who ridicules us so brazenly...

23
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:18,539
..irreverently...

24
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,607
...stupidly?

25
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,579
I beg your forgiveness

26
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,326
I won't be sold to anyone..

27
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:33,216
...but that young man

28
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:33,617
Me?

29
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,629
He won't have enough money

30
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:40,833
You've decided?

31
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:45,706
Yes. He has smooth cheeks,
and his beauty enchants me

32
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:50,276
Come on, buy this slave.
She has chosen you

33
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:53,488
She's yours

34
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,200
Take my hand. Come along

35
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:16,628
Take this money

36
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:18,333
What then?

37
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:24,938
Pay the seller, and then rent a house
in the district of carpenters

38
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,966
Not there silly. Not like that

39
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:06,985
I don't know. Show me the way

40
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:27,993
Stop playing and come here, Barsum

41
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,534
Nuradin, come and see

42
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,302
See what, my love?

43
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,082
Did you stay up all night to do that?

44
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:22,953
Go to the market and sell it
for two hundred dinars

45
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:28,583
Listen carefully. Don't sell it to
a blue-eyed man

46
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,043
Not at any price

47
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:38,847
I fear that something will part us.
Something is going to happen

48
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,379
Fear not, I am here

49
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,501
Look how beautiful this is, sir

50
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,450
A work of art. Who made it?

51
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,233
A slave girl made it for me

52
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,298
I'll buy her

53
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,330
You ask me to sell my soul

54
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:11,275
I'm joking. Please buy it..

55
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:12,786
...for two hundred dinars

56
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:15,435
I'll pay one thousand

57
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:22,296
I've been forbidden to sell it to
a blue-eyed man

58
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:26,964
- That's a good offer,
it's more than it's worth

59
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:31,285
Very well, but stay away from me

60
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,369
Why follow me?

61
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,625
I'm hungry. All I ask is
something to eat

62
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,623
There's nothing in the house
Go with God

63
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:12,090
God expects us to help each other,
doesn't he?

64
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,128
What are you reading?

65
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:35,934
Listen

66
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:23,780
My eyes saw her, to my misfortune

67
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,236
What agony it was to leave her there

68
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,029
Poets of my court

69
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,268
Let us see if it is true that poets can
speak of things they have not seen

70
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,385
Compose a poem that begins with
the words I have recited

71
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,655
My eyes saw her, to my misfortune

72
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,451
My eyes saw her, to my misfortune.
What agony it was to leave her there

73
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:02,457
She held me captive beneath the
shade of two palm trees

74
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:05,702
She bathed in water
from a silver vase

75
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,935
Her hands were too small...

76
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:14,141
...to hide her charms from me - ah,
to lie with her for an hour or two

77
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:22,497
I said to two youths: "I love you".
"Have you money?", they replied

78
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:25,490
"Yes, I spend generously"

79
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,541
"Then we can strike a bargain"

80
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,947
Those boys, who are they?

81
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,167
Wit. May I read some verses to you?

82
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:06,748
I wrote them when I was almost
as young as you

83
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:12,402
I am old now, with all the desires of
the young

84
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:18,854
I have a passion for enjoyment,
and I love men in their youth

85
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:26,004
Oh city of piety, our thoughts
are constantly driven to sin

86
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:27,493
I have a suggestion

87
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:28,380
Tell us

88
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,834
I promise everything you desire

89
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:38,190
Wine, brought by the brothers
of the monastery

90
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,329
Lamb, and many delicate birds

91
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:48,179
We shall eat, drink, you will take
pleasure with each other...

92
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,418
...and with me, if you wish to
reward an old man

93
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,786
It will please us

94
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:07,399
The greatest joy is a young drinker
with handsome boys for company

95
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,636
One sings for him, one drinks
to his health

96
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:15,349
..and the other offers him
his mouth to be kissed

97
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,938
Can you think of a verse about us?

98
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,744
I would give my life

99
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:25,391
for the tenderness of this cheek,
what bliss

100
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:30,955
I thank God for the fair cheeks
of youth

101
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:36,797
beardless and so beautiful

102
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:42,960
While my soul remains in this
tranquil village...

103
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:45,996
...my heart is torn between
two desires..

104
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:49,085
...the minarets of Baghdad...

105
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:54,849
...and the land of the two mosques

106
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:37,300
-What is your name?.
-Berhame

107
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,318
How old are you?.
-Fifteen

108
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:44,731
-Are you married?
-No, and I don't want to marry

109
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:47,288
Why not? Has a woman hurt you?

110
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,005
No, but books say they are treacherous

111
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:54,960
Heaven on earth is to be found
on their breasts

112
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,237
That is written in books

113
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,472
But it is their nature to
betray men, whether near or far

114
00:15:02,573 --> 00:15:08,707
They paint their eyes, dye their hair,
they make you swallow bitter pills

115
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,862
Will you come with us?

116
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:13,241
With pleasure, sir

117
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:43,186
-What is your name?
-Giana

118
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:46,205
-How old are you?
-Fifteen

119
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:50,661
-Will you come with us?
-With pleasure

120
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:14,522
Come along

121
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:24,334
You'll lose your bet, Zuedi. The girl
is no match for my Berhame

122
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:27,178
No point in disputing their merits

123
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,854
We've put them to sleep with
different drugs

124
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,130
They'll wake at different times

125
00:16:34,232 --> 00:16:37,139
You and I will never agree

126
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:44,841
She is more beautiful than he. Look

127
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:54,708
You're wrong. He is the most handsome

128
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,787
Love will decide the contest

129
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:03,777
We will wake them, and the one who
falls in love with the other...

130
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,854
...is the less beautiful:
the plain love the beautiful

131
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:09,873
Very well, love will decide

132
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:47,811
God wills what will happen,
or won't happen

133
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:12,076
Neither of us has won.
They love each other equally

134
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:17,938
One is the mirror of the other.
Two bright moons in the same sky

135
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,476
How did you get in?

136
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:23,074
What difference does it make?

137
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:24,287
Recognize me, Zumarud?

138
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:26,951
You dared to say...

139
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:32,238
...I couldn't get it up -
now I will punish you

140
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:38,479
God will punish you!

141
00:22:41,187 --> 00:22:41,766
Nuradin!

142
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:04,182
Blood of my blood, Zumarud

143
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,113
Where are you?

144
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:53,407
Why are you crying, handsome lad?

145
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:54,725
What's happening?

146
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,599
I've lost Zumarud, my slave.
I paid a thousand dinars for her

147
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,877
A blue-eyed Christian stole her
from me

148
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:03,475
I'll die without her

149
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:07,732
Don't cry, I'll find her

150
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:15,724
...even if I have to disguise myself
and search every house

151
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:40,896
I  have good news for you, Nuradin

152
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:55,290
She was taken to Rashid's house.
I spoke to her there

153
00:24:57,197 --> 00:25:00,573
She'll be waiting for you tonight

154
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,926
Whistle, and escape with her

155
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:10,154
I helped, didn't I?
Now you must reward me

156
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:18,104
My love

157
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,264
You'll make him rise

158
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,453
I'll keep it up, then

159
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:47,734
Nuradin, grab the rope

160
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:49,042
Help me, my love

161
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,166
Hold this bag full of gold

162
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,104
Who are you? Where are you taking me?

163
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:18,083
I'm me, and I'll take you where I like

164
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:22,567
Nuradin's hair is silky.
You feel like a pig

165
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:25,492
Let me go, you ugly beast!

166
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:29,201
Hold your tongue, or I'll murder you

167
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:36,563
We killed that soldier. We'll do the
same to you if you don't shut up

168
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:46,970
We're forty thieves, and tonight
we'll all have you

169
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:12,241
I've brought you something precious,
father

170
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:15,769
I'll be back with the others soon

171
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,874
I bet your head is full of lice

172
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:34,358
Shall I pick them out for you?

173
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,776
Sleep, baby, sleep. Go to bye-byes

174
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,776
Rider from the desert,
you will be crowned King

175
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,568
- What is your name?
- Warden. I am a soldier

176
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,006
When our King dies...

177
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:14,422
...leaving no heirs, we await the
first man from the desert..

178
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:16,508
...and make him King

179
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:25,440
Blessed be the Lord for sending us
a slim and handsome man

180
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:58,571
Before the coronation you must have a
wife. You will marry my daughter

181
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:01,140
Who said I wanted to marry?

182
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,906
If you refuse, you will be thrown
from a high tower

183
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:07,184
I shall obey the will of God

184
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:50,065
Why just sit there?

185
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:54,250
Don't you like your new bride?

186
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,206
You are beautiful, Hayat,
but I am unhappy

187
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,205
Do you love another woman?

188
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:01,362
If you don't consummate our marriage...

189
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:03,940
...you'll be thrown from a tower

190
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,917
I must tell you a secret

191
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,936
Will you promise to tell no one?

192
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,343
I promise

193
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,440
Look, then

194
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:37,361
Now you know my secret. If I'm
betrayed, I'll be thrown from a tower

195
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:40,358
I won't betray you, Warden

196
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,594
My name is Zumarud. I am Nuradin's
slave, but I don't know where he is

197
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:49,549
I will help you find him, I won't
give away your secret

198
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:54,184
I might find him if we can get
many people to come here

199
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:57,920
Try to be my wife and keep our secret

200
00:33:58,022 --> 00:34:02,340
I promise. We'll get many people
to come here

201
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:57,837
Don't eat from that plate

202
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,372
The King said we can eat our fill

203
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:03,816
But not from other people's plates

204
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:05,470
I'll eat what I like

205
00:35:07,364 --> 00:35:11,332
Eat what you like. then,
and choke on it

206
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,689
I told him not to eat from
other people's plates

207
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:25,654
If the King has him whipped,
he deserves it

208
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:29,541
What is your name?
Why have you come here?

209
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:33,891
My name is Ali. I'm a weaver,
come to trade

210
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:37,047
Look me straight in the eyes

211
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,566
You lie to a king? You're Barsum who
kidnapped a slave girl, aren't you?

212
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:46,294
Yes, King, I am Barsum

213
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:54,838
I sentence this blue-eyed man to be
taken from the city and put to death

214
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:27,695
Excuse me, do you know where I might
find my slave, Zumarud?

215
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,573
Children, Have you seen Zumarud
pass this way

216
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:34,776
Who is Zumarud?

217
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:23,523
Come with us

218
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:38,201
Don't be afraid, we'll just
give you a nice massage

219
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:41,655
Lie down here

220
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:50,541
- Stop, you're making him rise
- Of course

221
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:55,670
You're trying to take all his goodness

222
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:59,026
I can share it, can't I?

223
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:06,818
No, I made it stand. "Whoever brings
earth to life, owns it and enjoys it"

224
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,142
My mother told me different

225
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:12,640
"Game belongs to whoever takes it"

226
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:16,528
You found it, but I'm taking it

227
00:38:17,058 --> 00:38:20,966
As you two can't come to an agreement...

228
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:23,841
...I'll enjoy all of it

229
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:13,086
Don't eat that

230
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,749
I'll eat what I like

231
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,866
It's cursed. You'll be crucified
if you eat it

232
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:20,710
It happened to someone else

233
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:24,408
I don't care, I'll eat what I like

234
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:26,560
He'll even eat the plate

235
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:30,285
He's got the face of a dead man
already

236
00:39:30,387 --> 00:39:33,944
What can you do against God's will?

237
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:29,310
Are you strong enough to carry
things for me?

238
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:31,977
You will be well paid

239
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:41,293
Give me apples from Syria...

240
00:40:42,394 --> 00:40:46,620
...peaches from Amman, jasmine from
Aleppo, lemons from Egypt....

241
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:49,197
...myrtle, camomile...

242
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:52,993
...pomegranates, white roses...

243
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:56,931
...nutmeg ring cakes, sweets...

244
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:00,084
...short pastry, puff pastry,
sugar and incense...

245
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:03,122
...amber, musk and candlewax

246
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:19,549
Nabur! Budar!

247
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:23,778
Come down, I've got everything

248
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:35,429
Taci Almolup, son of King Sul e Man,
had grown into a handsome young man

249
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,511
Everyone who saw him was enchanted

250
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:40,014
Inspirer of poems...

251
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:44,122
...even the most modest became
shameless for his love

252
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:45,495
As the poet said:

253
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:50,776
"I embrace him and become drunk
with his perfume"

254
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:54,540
"Like a windswept branch,
I became drunk without drinking...

255
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:58,750
"...intoxicated by the liquor
of his saliva"

256
00:44:34,163 --> 00:44:36,859
Getting off his horse...

257
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,832
...Tagy saw a handsome young man
dressed in black

258
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:42,749
But he seemed depressed...

259
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:48,688
...as though separated from
his loved ones

260
00:45:04,738 --> 00:45:07,826
-What is that scroll?
-It means nothing, except for me

261
00:45:07,927 --> 00:45:08,495
Show me

262
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:23,299
Glory to God that allows us
to learn what we did not know

263
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,880
You began to cry when you saw this

264
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:29,631
My story is long

265
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:36,342
And the parts that link me to that
scroll and its owner are very strange

266
00:45:37,874 --> 00:45:40,169
Tell me your story,
and about the scroll

267
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:44,595
My name is Aziz and I was engaged to
my cousin Aziza

268
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:48,754
On the day of the wedding
I went to bathe

269
00:45:52,113 --> 00:45:55,194
Best wishes for you and Aziza

270
00:46:06,868 --> 00:46:09,949
You smell like a flower, Aziz

271
00:46:31,474 --> 00:46:32,570
Aziza, my bride

272
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:45,023
I forgot to invite my best friend,
Ali. I'll fetch him

273
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,606
Aziza is waiting

274
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:20,654
Don't put your handkerchief
under your arse

275
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:32,125
The sun and the moon are astonished
when he appears...

276
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:36,475
...and rosebuds are put to shame
by his curls

277
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,145
Everyone was here. They ate, drank
and waited for you

278
00:48:52,246 --> 00:48:57,720
They left, and your father has
postponed the wedding for a year

279
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:28,128
What happened to you?

280
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:35,027
I love a beautiful girl. From her
window she dropped her kerchief to me

281
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:40,322
Didn't she say anything?

282
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,745
No. She did this

283
00:49:52,144 --> 00:49:55,116
What do those gestures mean?

284
00:49:55,853 --> 00:50:01,307
Finger in the mouth means you're
chosen to be her body's soul

285
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:09,243
Two fingers between her breasts mean
return in two days to ease her heart

286
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:10,776
Two days?

287
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:42,931
Aziz, how awful you look

288
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:48,365
You haven't eaten or slept

289
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:55,522
Now dress and be happy,
two days have passed

290
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,915
Dress and go to her

291
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,469
God grant you happiness

292
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:57,367
Well, Aziz?

293
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:03,600
Haven't you spent the night in
the arms of your beloved?

294
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:15,194
I wasn't making fun of you.
Tell me what happened

295
00:52:15,387 --> 00:52:16,387
She didn't appear

296
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:25,116
She was testing the sincerity of your
love. You will have your desires

297
00:52:26,552 --> 00:52:29,881
Tomorrow night sit beneath her window

298
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:35,161
Your troubles are over. Now you must
eat, or you might die

299
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:44,483
Love drives you wild.
You can't eat or sleep

300
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:48,126
I know. These are the signs of love

301
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:58,874
-What happened?
-She did this

302
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,789
What does it mean?

303
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:23,602
Wait until the sun has set

304
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,224
When darkness falls..

305
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,164
...go to the garden at the far end of
the city, walk till you find a lamp

306
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:37,455
Wait for her. Her love is
almost killing her

307
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:44,637
It is not yet sunset. Eat,
you've not eaten for eight days

308
00:56:17,478 --> 00:56:18,334
How was it?

309
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:25,397
I dozed off. When I awoke I found
these. What do they mean?

310
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:32,018
The coin is her right eye,
the eye everybody swears by

311
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,295
The dagger means she will kill you...

312
00:56:33,397 --> 00:56:36,008
...if you disappoint her again tonight

313
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,256
What must I do?

314
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,998
Return to her garden tonight

315
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:45,655
But don't doze again.
Eat something. Rest

316
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,686
I hope to die

317
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:00,955
Wake up and eat

318
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,236
I'm not hungry

319
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,813
Don't act up like a baby

320
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,845
Be sure not to fall asleep again.
She will come at dawn

321
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:26,790
I'll give you some advice

322
00:57:29,014 --> 00:57:33,394
When you leave her...after...
recite these lines

323
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:43,867
In the name of God, what to do
when love becomes master?

324
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:02,958
Nothing must be touched

325
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,363
My love, you waited for me

326
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:16,379
Did you recite the lines?

327
00:59:17,694 --> 00:59:21,883
I forgot, because she gave
this scroll to me

328
00:59:29,863 --> 00:59:30,949
May I have it?

329
00:59:32,032 --> 00:59:33,467
Yes, if you like it

330
00:59:41,553 --> 00:59:45,640
Tomorrow, before leaving her,
promise to recite those lines

331
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:48,813
I promise. Now I am so happy

332
01:00:56,995 --> 01:01:03,393
In the name of God,
what to do when love becomes master?

333
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:10,152
I say: She who loves must hide her
secret and be resigned to it

334
01:01:18,704 --> 01:01:23,252
-Where is Aziza?
-On the terrace, alone and crying

335
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:30,123
How have you the heart to leave her,
without a thought of her suffering

336
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,294
Did you recite?

337
01:02:19,587 --> 01:02:24,991
Yes. She said: She who loves must
hide her secret and be resigned to it

338
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:30,637
She has tried, but her heart was
broken by an impossible passion

339
01:02:32,094 --> 01:02:36,593
Tomorrow, as you leave, recite
those lines to her

340
01:02:38,932 --> 01:02:45,607
She has tried, but her heart was
broken by an impossible passion

341
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:59,829
Unable to resign herself,
she might as well be dead

342
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:11,075
Did you recite?

343
01:03:13,146 --> 01:03:17,667
Yes. She said: Unable to resign
herself, she might as well be dead

344
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:23,346
We hear and obey, Say good-bye to
her who has prevented my love

345
01:05:13,405 --> 01:05:14,863
Listen

346
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:22,093
We hear and obey. Say good-bye to
her who has prevented my love

347
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:25,609
The girl who recited those lines
has died

348
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:29,764
If I had known about her
I would not have let you near me

349
01:05:29,867 --> 01:05:32,075
She is my cousin

350
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:38,588
She knew we loved

351
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:44,751
May God make you weep for her
as you made her weep for you

352
01:05:44,852 --> 01:05:45,940
Go and see her

353
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:14,678
How long will the ceremony go on?

354
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:22,602
We shall pray until late tonight. You,
too, with her death on your conscience

355
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:29,342
What did you do to break her heart?
She told me nothing

356
01:06:30,045 --> 01:06:31,941
I didn't do anything

357
01:06:32,442 --> 01:06:36,614
Before she died she recited a line
for you to tell the other girl

358
01:06:36,716 --> 01:06:40,411
Fidelity is splendid, but
no more than infidelity

359
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:41,641
I'll tell her

360
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:47,205
She left you something to give you, but
I want to see you suffer for her death

361
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:48,875
Show me

362
01:06:48,945 --> 01:06:52,798
I don't see you crying and praying
because she is dead

363
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,631
I must go, I can't wait

364
01:07:06,327 --> 01:07:06,894
My love

365
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:15,161
You were right, she is dead.
We buried her today

366
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:20,850
I'm sure you are to blame
for her death

367
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:23,836
She left some words for you

368
01:07:23,938 --> 01:07:28,380
Fidelity is splendid, but
no more than infidelity

369
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:32,183
That message may have saved you.
I thought I would cause you harm

370
01:07:32,285 --> 01:07:33,032
Harm? How?

371
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:39,809
Tonight, before you make love to me,
go and seek charity for your soul

372
01:07:39,912 --> 01:07:44,634
Then have a marble tombstone carved,
fit for a saint

373
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:49,685
I'll do as you ask

374
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:53,307
Go

375
01:08:02,196 --> 01:08:04,820
Aziz, some more perfume

376
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:35,761
Read me this letter from my son.
He works far away

377
01:08:38,617 --> 01:08:40,711
"Dear father, I am well...

378
01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:43,786
"...but I can't earn money here

379
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:48,460
"It is God's will. I send my love.
Your son, Ali"

380
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:52,742
Now come to my house.
Let me offer you wine

381
01:09:06,132 --> 01:09:08,865
Which would you prefer:
living or dying?

382
01:09:08,967 --> 01:09:09,424
Living

383
01:09:10,325 --> 01:09:12,939
Then let's get married

384
01:09:16,516 --> 01:09:18,691
Then you'll be safe from Mad Budar

385
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:19,649
Who is she?

386
01:09:21,588 --> 01:09:22,735
Don't you know?

387
01:09:23,305 --> 01:09:26,237
You've made love to her for a year

388
01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:30,990
You've been safe because of Aziza, but
where will you find another like her?

389
01:09:31,092 --> 01:09:35,814
You know nothing of the perversity
of women, do you?

390
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:42,450
I want to save you, but I'm not like
your cousin. I want reward. I'm rich

391
01:09:42,552 --> 01:09:45,006
Nothing's lacking in my house

392
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:48,123
All I ask is: be my rooster

393
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:49,950
Rooster? How?

394
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,244
Come close, you can't get away

395
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:06,612
Do what you like to me,
I am your slave

396
01:10:06,714 --> 01:10:09,388
Give me all of yourself

397
01:10:32,831 --> 01:10:36,721
It's been a year and we've kept
our promises

398
01:10:36,825 --> 01:10:39,878
You can go to your mother,
but swear to return tonight

399
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:40,777
I swear it

400
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:04,636
You're waiting for me? How did you
know I'd return today?

401
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:09,221
I've waited a year, without moving
day and night

402
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:15,021
I'm married. We have a son. I can
only stay with you for one night

403
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:17,916
Thank you very much, Aziz

404
01:11:18,477 --> 01:11:24,575
But as you're married I'm no longer
interested. If I can't have you...

405
01:11:27,923 --> 01:11:28,980
Women!

406
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:50,323
Fidelity is splendid, but
no more than infidelity

407
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:53,629
Once again those words save you

408
01:11:55,178 --> 01:11:58,849
Your life is saved, but I'll
punish you

409
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:02,165
Get powders for the wound

410
01:12:02,645 --> 01:12:04,031
What are you doing?

411
01:12:49,769 --> 01:12:51,215
Where have you been?

412
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:56,127
What have you been doing
all this time?

413
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:07,998
Aziza, how good you were to me,
how you loved me

414
01:13:20,758 --> 01:13:23,432
Aziza left this for you

415
01:13:24,912 --> 01:13:27,746
Now I can give it to you

416
01:13:36,173 --> 01:13:39,666
"This is the work of Princess Dunya

417
01:13:40,127 --> 01:13:43,140
"You must believe that I do not
blame you for anything

418
01:13:43,243 --> 01:13:48,483
"I thank God for letting me die
before you die. Your Aziza"

419
01:13:58,297 --> 01:14:01,030
I entered the garden of Dunya

420
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:04,185
I saw her and fell in love with her

421
01:14:04,287 --> 01:14:08,578
What can I do now? I have become
like a girl

422
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:19,361
What is the matter, sir?

423
01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:30,863
Let me go to Dunya's city

424
01:14:31,484 --> 01:14:35,906
I love her without seeing her.
Help me find her

425
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:43,262
When my father sees my bloodstained
clothes he'll think I'm dead

426
01:15:15,572 --> 01:15:20,802
That is Dunya's father. Perhaps
he is seeking a son-in-law

427
01:15:24,757 --> 01:15:25,734
Come on, Tagy

428
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,244
Is this the market place?

429
01:15:31,347 --> 01:15:34,080
Be careful of the Sheikh of the market

430
01:15:34,182 --> 01:15:36,835
He prefers bananas to figs

431
01:15:36,937 --> 01:15:40,021
That's him smoking over there

432
01:15:41,331 --> 01:15:42,727
Good morning, Sheikh

433
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,763
What handsome lads

434
01:15:45,843 --> 01:15:48,656
But dirty from their journey

435
01:15:48,759 --> 01:15:51,811
Before anything else, you must bathe

436
01:15:51,912 --> 01:15:57,791
As the poet said: May the bath-keeper
enjoy a long and happy life...

437
01:15:58,142 --> 01:16:01,705
...and caress sweetly
so many bodies

438
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:06,379
You like to enjoy their beauty
in the bath, eh?

439
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:09,821
I'm not like Dunya, our Princess
who hates men...

440
01:16:09,923 --> 01:16:13,765
...and can't abide any
talk of marriage

441
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:27,872
Are you the gardener here?

442
01:16:27,975 --> 01:16:28,662
Yes. Why?

443
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:32,505
May we see the garden?

444
01:16:40,713 --> 01:16:43,127
-Whose garden is this?
-The daughter of the King

445
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:47,240
-She hates men and won't marry?
-Yes, sir

446
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:52,892
She dreamt a pigeon was caught in a
net and saved by its companion

447
01:16:52,994 --> 01:16:55,228
But when a dove was caught
the pigeon did not help it...

448
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,776
...and the dove died

449
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:01,018
Now she thinks that all men are like
that pigeon

450
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,254
How much does this Dunya pay you?

451
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:04,394
Only one dinar

452
01:17:05,793 --> 01:17:09,683
I want to do good in this garden
Will you help me?

453
01:17:09,786 --> 01:17:11,182
Something good, sir?

454
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:19,249
-Take these three hundred dinars
-Do as you wish in this garden, sir

455
01:17:20,689 --> 01:17:21,955
What will you do?

456
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:36,680
-I need two labourers
-At your service

457
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:39,715
I'll pay three dinars a day

458
01:17:39,818 --> 01:17:42,382
-No good
-Four dinars

459
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:46,176
Six... nine

460
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:52,884
We'll only accept if you will pay
us one dinar a day each

461
01:18:26,023 --> 01:18:27,240
Are you brothers?

462
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,263
Brothers in God, not blood brothers

463
01:18:32,252 --> 01:18:36,732
Brothers in God... but why
have you become beggars?

464
01:18:36,835 --> 01:18:37,752
To serve God

465
01:18:38,602 --> 01:18:41,686
Why decide to live like this?

466
01:18:43,394 --> 01:18:47,444
Tell me, it could bring me
a little closer to God

467
01:18:47,547 --> 01:18:52,717
If it enhances the Glory of God,
I will tell you my story

468
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:04,663
Thank you for helping me,
I'm dying of hunger and thirst

469
01:21:04,764 --> 01:21:10,053
I'm a king's son. Bandits attacked us
as we took gifts to the King of India

470
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:15,745
Don't tell anyone. I'll shelter you,
but our  cities are enemies

471
01:21:16,107 --> 01:21:19,159
I'll be no trouble. I can work

472
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,297
I have studied

473
01:21:22,656 --> 01:21:27,318
I can write, do sums,
I know science and literature

474
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:32,029
That's not worth anything here

475
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:35,273
Mony is all people understand

476
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:41,244
Here you can chop wood,
that's all you'll be good for

477
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:52,088
Are you a man or a demon?

478
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:52,977
I'm a man

479
01:22:54,546 --> 01:22:57,439
-How did you find your way here?
-I suppose it was fate

480
01:22:57,542 --> 01:23:01,374
Perhaps it is to end my pain and sorrow

481
01:23:09,642 --> 01:23:11,028
Who are you, child?

482
01:23:12,358 --> 01:23:18,117
A king's daughter. A demon kidnapped
me and locked me in this tomb

483
01:23:18,428 --> 01:23:22,238
Every ten days he comes here
and makes love to me

484
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:27,680
If I need him I have only to touch
the words on that tablet

485
01:23:49,377 --> 01:23:52,860
I want to free you from that demon

486
01:23:54,009 --> 01:23:58,481
You must be mine alone.
I'll take you from here

487
01:23:58,682 --> 01:24:02,454
If the demon comes, I'll deal with him

488
01:24:04,074 --> 01:24:04,411
Run!

489
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:08,704
The demon will kill you

490
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:04,513
Do you know who these belong to?

491
01:25:04,614 --> 01:25:07,638
We've never seen them before

492
01:25:15,358 --> 01:25:18,969
I'm looking for the owner of
these shoes

493
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,856
None of us has lost them

494
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:36,632
Tailor, do you know the man who
owns these shoes?

495
01:25:39,118 --> 01:25:41,972
Someone's found your shoes

496
01:26:30,077 --> 01:26:33,869
Your lover. Kill him and
spare yourself

497
01:26:51,161 --> 01:26:55,352
Kill her and you'll be released
without harm

498
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,953
I can't kill a woman I've never seen before,
who's never hurt me

499
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:10,080
There's love between you two

500
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:52,840
you've made love with your eyes,
at least

501
01:28:11,711 --> 01:28:15,135
I'm not sure you have betrayed me

502
01:28:17,261 --> 01:28:20,554
I won't kill you, but you
won't go unpunished

503
01:28:20,656 --> 01:28:23,030
I beg you to be merciful

504
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:25,686
-Let me go
-No mercy

505
01:28:44,777 --> 01:28:47,811
Hold fast, you damned monkey!

506
01:29:23,115 --> 01:29:27,477
In the name of God and with
His great power...

507
01:29:27,907 --> 01:29:32,158
...I make you as you should have
been created

508
01:29:35,055 --> 01:29:35,682
A monkey

509
01:30:23,617 --> 01:30:24,134
Captain

510
01:30:28,847 --> 01:30:32,299
Before we reach port you must write
the log of your voyage

511
01:30:32,402 --> 01:30:33,738
You forgot, Captain

512
01:30:56,363 --> 01:30:58,698
"Let destiny take its course

513
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,012
"Accept willingly what is given.
Be not happy or sad about anything

514
01:31:02,114 --> 01:31:04,128
"But if you open the inkwell
of power and grace...

515
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:06,125
"...ensure your ink flows...

516
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:09,480
"...with liberality and generosity"

517
01:31:09,581 --> 01:31:12,735
This writing is truly beautiful

518
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:19,026
None of my advisors can form
such exquisite characters

519
01:31:19,127 --> 01:31:24,078
Dress the author in attire of honour
and bring him here

520
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:38,768
Ibriza, look

521
01:33:40,257 --> 01:33:44,268
Father, why do you let a stranger
see me?

522
01:33:44,929 --> 01:33:48,303
Is it true what my daughter says?

523
01:33:49,322 --> 01:33:52,626
You are a man and not a monkey?

524
01:33:53,956 --> 01:33:57,380
Father, he is a man, not a monkey

525
01:33:57,628 --> 01:34:01,678
Free him from his present condition,
then, and I shall appoint him Vizier

526
01:34:01,781 --> 01:34:04,575
I shall obey your command

527
01:34:10,527 --> 01:34:14,598
Though it cost me my life,
you are welcome

528
01:34:20,512 --> 01:34:23,924
Poor monkey, your soul is stronger
than your nature

529
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:27,230
Thank you for returning my soul

530
01:34:38,641 --> 01:34:41,414
She sacrificed her life for me

531
01:34:41,518 --> 01:34:42,904
Such was my grief..

532
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:47,765
...it could have shattered mountains

533
01:34:47,868 --> 01:34:50,712
I felt I had offended God

534
01:35:28,961 --> 01:35:32,811
You are determined to relinquish
everything for wisdom. Why?

535
01:35:32,915 --> 01:35:38,115
Because I think that destiny governs
our lives, nothing more

536
01:36:01,987 --> 01:36:03,373
God grant you peace

537
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:05,460
May God be with you

538
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:10,202
I wish to entrust you with a mission

539
01:36:10,554 --> 01:36:12,440
Very well. I accept

540
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:15,404
God has revealed to me...

541
01:36:16,283 --> 01:36:19,296
...that at noon you will come to me
on that island...

542
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:22,652
...and find me dead near a well

543
01:36:23,671 --> 01:36:27,243
Wash me and wrap me in a shroud
you will find beside me

544
01:36:27,346 --> 01:36:33,646
Take my turban and tunic. Give them
to whoever asks for them

545
01:36:34,297 --> 01:36:35,384
I will do that

546
01:37:21,617 --> 01:37:26,449
Yunan. My son, keep your eyes
closed and listen to me

547
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:30,841
The sea, Yunan, the sea

548
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,537
Ask your father..

549
01:37:34,277 --> 01:37:37,591
...to allow you to make a voyage

550
01:38:13,133 --> 01:38:13,590
Father

551
01:38:14,412 --> 01:38:18,149
Haven't we islands over the sea?

552
01:38:18,251 --> 01:38:19,238
Yes. Why?

553
01:38:19,445 --> 01:38:21,438
I want to arm a ship and visit them

554
01:38:22,542 --> 01:38:26,266
Are you sure you want to do that?

555
01:38:26,394 --> 01:38:27,889
You're even afraid of bathing

556
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:32,442
You still play with children
and you are lazy

557
01:38:34,419 --> 01:38:37,522
But, father, I want to see the world

558
01:39:20,943 --> 01:39:24,835
Climb the mast and tell us
what you see

559
01:39:43,587 --> 01:39:45,962
Starboard teems with fish

560
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:48,907
To port there is a shadow

561
01:39:51,614 --> 01:39:54,718
Sometimes white,
sometimes black

562
01:39:55,367 --> 01:39:58,561
We're lost. We will all perish

563
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,577
Why say that?

564
01:40:02,118 --> 01:40:04,611
We are near Black Stone Mountain

565
01:40:04,712 --> 01:40:08,853
Beneath a copper dome stands
a copper knight

566
01:40:09,823 --> 01:40:14,245
As long as he is there
boats will be smashed...

567
01:40:14,315 --> 01:40:17,219
...against the rocks below

568
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:49,959
Beneath your feet you will find a
copper bow and a lead arrow

569
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:54,592
Aim at the knight beneath the dome

570
01:41:54,694 --> 01:42:00,573
Topple him into the sea and the
world will be rid of this misfortune

571
01:43:27,023 --> 01:43:30,157
Don't come out for any reason

572
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:36,656
When I return I will open the door

573
01:44:43,618 --> 01:44:44,535
Who are you?

574
01:44:45,895 --> 01:44:48,619
Go away! Don't kill me!

575
01:45:07,819 --> 01:45:09,205
Please let me live!

576
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:48,161
As a king's son it is my sacred duty
to be your friend

577
01:45:48,832 --> 01:45:54,280
It's predicted that I will be murdered
today, my fifteenth birthday...

578
01:45:54,383 --> 01:46:00,034
...by a sightless man who
would come from the sea...

579
01:46:00,136 --> 01:46:03,667
...and topple the statue of a knight

580
01:46:03,769 --> 01:46:08,100
To pay for this an innocent victim
was needed. Me

581
01:46:08,201 --> 01:46:11,414
Trust in the goodness of God
and be content

582
01:46:11,516 --> 01:46:16,447
I'm glad I was shipwrecked and
I'm here to defend you

583
01:46:16,587 --> 01:46:20,398
Anyone who seeks to harm you
will have to answer to me

584
01:46:20,502 --> 01:46:25,911
I'm glad you are my guest here,
even though it is underground

585
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:30,634
There is a beautiful bath here

586
01:46:32,882 --> 01:46:39,220
Happy is the bath boy when he touches
the breast of Ali, the back of Malik

587
01:46:41,428 --> 01:46:45,398
The bath may seem an inferno,
but it is paradise

588
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:49,351
You'll find bodies as beautiful
as suns and moons

589
01:46:49,455 --> 01:46:51,669
I know a poem about the bath, too

590
01:46:51,771 --> 01:46:52,978
A life of joy...

591
01:46:56,843 --> 01:47:01,695
...for those bathers upon whom
ardent tears have fallen

592
01:48:54,252 --> 01:48:54,999
Look there

593
01:48:56,489 --> 01:48:59,223
That boy along the beach

594
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:04,244
He could be Yunan, my son

595
01:49:05,874 --> 01:49:07,190
Yes, it is my son

596
01:49:09,947 --> 01:49:12,791
Son, it is I, your father

597
01:49:39,579 --> 01:49:41,074
God be with you, sir

598
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:44,479
Are you giving me a tunic?

599
01:49:46,408 --> 01:49:47,435
Give it to me

600
01:50:09,272 --> 01:50:10,648
What is happening?

601
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:12,247
Good-bye, father

602
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:28,867
Where are you going?

603
01:51:07,514 --> 01:51:10,308
Dunya, look in that house

604
01:51:11,788 --> 01:51:13,174
How beautiful it is

605
01:51:14,305 --> 01:51:15,691
Look at the ceiling

606
01:51:31,597 --> 01:51:34,101
It's beautiful, Dunya

607
01:51:38,646 --> 01:51:41,350
That is the story I dreamt

608
01:51:42,459 --> 01:51:48,281
Yes, the dove caught in the net.
But what more?

609
01:51:51,324 --> 01:51:52,622
The pigeon who flew away
because he was a coward...

610
01:51:52,784 --> 01:51:55,938
...was caught by a bird of prey

611
01:51:57,635 --> 01:52:00,148
Sometimes dreams are bad teachers....

612
01:52:01,107 --> 01:52:03,161
...because one dream does not
tell the whole story

613
01:52:03,265 --> 01:52:06,349
The truth lies in many dreams

614
01:54:35,498 --> 01:54:37,431
Look, silly, and don't make a mistake

615
01:54:37,534 --> 01:54:38,860
What is it called?

616
01:54:45,811 --> 01:54:47,558
Honey cake

617
01:54:49,357 --> 01:54:50,634
Fig

618
01:54:53,069 --> 01:54:55,116
-Pigeon
-Wrong

619
01:54:56,183 --> 01:54:57,860
Tell me, then

620
01:54:57,983 --> 01:54:59,277
Perfumed meadow grass

621
01:54:59,378 --> 01:55:02,821
Thank God for perfumed meadow grass

622
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:06,904
Now it's my turn. What is this called?

623
01:55:07,007 --> 01:55:08,502
Don't make a mistake

624
01:55:12,977 --> 01:55:14,806
Perfumed meadow grass

625
01:55:14,909 --> 01:55:15,306
Wrong

626
01:55:16,651 --> 01:55:17,928
Tell me, then

627
01:55:19,249 --> 01:55:21,983
Peeled sweet pomegranate

628
01:55:22,143 --> 01:55:25,915
Now it's my turn.
What is this called?

629
01:55:27,055 --> 01:55:29,588
Don't make another mistake

630
01:55:29,691 --> 01:55:30,708
Peeled sweet pomegranate

631
01:55:31,309 --> 01:55:32,922
Idiot! That's not the name

632
01:55:33,025 --> 01:55:34,302
Tell me, then

633
01:55:34,603 --> 01:55:36,098
The Inn of Good Food

634
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:40,273
And what is this called?

635
01:55:40,893 --> 01:55:43,867
Don't make any mistakes

636
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:50,900
Do you know?

637
01:55:59,883 --> 01:56:01,260
Tell us, then

638
01:56:02,338 --> 01:56:03,565
The donkey...

639
01:56:03,674 --> 01:56:07,565
...who grazes perfumed meadow grass,
eats peeled sweet pomegranates...

640
01:56:07,668 --> 01:56:12,090
...and spends the night in
the Inn of Good Food

641
01:56:33,508 --> 01:56:35,025
Zumarud

642
01:57:05,695 --> 01:57:07,708
You want to tear me to pieces?

643
01:57:07,811 --> 01:57:11,404
Go on. I'm tired of looking for her

644
01:57:13,179 --> 01:57:16,973
I had a beautiful slave who loved me

645
01:57:17,075 --> 01:57:21,497
Kill me, eat me, then my suffering
will be over

646
01:57:31,993 --> 01:57:33,580
What now?

647
01:57:39,959 --> 01:57:41,285
I don't understand

648
01:57:43,394 --> 01:57:45,830
Am I to follow you?

649
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,195
All right, I'll come

650
01:59:36,330 --> 01:59:38,863
Don't! It could be dangerous

651
01:59:38,964 --> 01:59:41,537
Everyone who has eaten that has died

652
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,774
Let him eat. See what happens

653
01:59:43,876 --> 01:59:48,648
If I'm killed
it will end my suffering

654
02:00:04,284 --> 02:00:06,838
-What is your name?
-Nuradin

655
02:00:06,942 --> 02:00:11,104
Dress him, perfume him and
bring him to my chambers

656
02:00:11,234 --> 02:00:15,084
The King is treating him courteously.
He may not die

657
02:00:15,188 --> 02:00:18,741
The King has noticed his lovely eyes

658
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:21,871
Perhaps our King prefers
the melon to the plum

659
02:00:21,974 --> 02:00:26,184
That young man made me feel the same

660
02:00:35,834 --> 02:00:38,921
Massage my legs

661
02:00:48,933 --> 02:00:49,494
Come on

662
02:00:51,969 --> 02:00:52,768
Much higher

663
02:00:53,444 --> 02:00:55,993
I'll massage your calves, no more

664
02:00:56,096 --> 02:01:00,517
You'll do as I command.
I want you as my lover

665
02:01:04,722 --> 02:01:07,985
I may grace you with the title Emir

666
02:01:08,086 --> 02:01:08,885
Your lover?

667
02:01:09,589 --> 02:01:10,666
Lie on the bed

668
02:01:11,807 --> 02:01:15,148
I've never done it before. Take back
your presents, let me leave

669
02:01:15,249 --> 02:01:17,601
Obey me. Lie on the bed...

670
02:01:17,702 --> 02:01:20,698
...or I'll have you beheaded

671
02:01:40,457 --> 02:01:41,137
Turn over

672
02:01:47,144 --> 02:01:49,744
Pull your trousers down

673
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:12,884
Don't hurt me too much

674
02:02:12,986 --> 02:02:16,976
Do you like love poems

675
02:02:18,334 --> 02:02:20,147
Don't look. Listen

676
02:02:20,386 --> 02:02:22,926
Two twigs of myrtle...

677
02:02:24,778 --> 02:02:28,001
...placed on a young man's cheeks

678
02:02:28,102 --> 02:02:30,572
the sun and the moon are astonished
when he appears

679
02:02:30,674 --> 02:02:33,921
What shame for the myrtle
when the youth unbends

680
02:02:34,224 --> 02:02:35,204
All right

681
02:02:36,136 --> 02:02:39,042
Another poem. Don't look at me

682
02:02:39,142 --> 02:02:43,433
I told a young man of my desires.
"Why offend me?", he said

683
02:02:43,536 --> 02:02:45,017
I showed him a dinar

684
02:02:45,158 --> 02:02:47,986
...and the young man said:

685
02:02:48,561 --> 02:02:53,733
"I can't refuse if it is my destiny
to be mounted by you"

686
02:02:54,458 --> 02:02:57,732
One more poem. Don't look at me

687
02:02:58,534 --> 02:03:02,647
Take with strength everything
that you desire

688
02:03:30,558 --> 02:03:31,994
Won't it stand?

689
02:03:32,923 --> 02:03:37,701
Not unless you touch me.
Don't be afraid to touch me

690
02:03:42,851 --> 02:03:44,213
Go on

691
02:03:49,327 --> 02:03:53,327
You're made like a woman.
Now mine is standing

692
02:03:53,794 --> 02:03:57,971
My love, dont you recognize
your slave?

693
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:01,250
Zumarud, my love

694
02:04:08,116 --> 02:04:10,977
I know a poem, too

695
02:04:14,199 --> 02:04:20,324
What a night! The beginning was bitter,
but how sweet is the end
