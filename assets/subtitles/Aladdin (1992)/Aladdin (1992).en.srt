1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,720
<i>Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place</i>

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,080
<i>Where the caravan camels roam</i>

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,640
<i>Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense</i>

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,120
<i>It's barbaric but hey, it's home</i>

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,680
<i>When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west</i>

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,840
<i>And the sand in the glass is right</i>

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,880
<i>Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly</i>

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
<i>To another Arabian night</i>

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
<i>Arabian nights</i>

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,520
<i>Like Arabian days</i>

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,160
<i>More often than not
Are hotter than hot</i>

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,680
<i>In a lot of good ways</i>

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,080
<i>Arabian nights</i>

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,600
<i>'Neath Arabian moons</i>

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
<i>A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard</i>

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,160
<i>Out there on the dunes</i>

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320
Ah, salaam, and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
Please, please, come closer.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,080
T oo close. A little too close.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
There.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,040
Welcome to Agrabah,

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,480
city of mystery,

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,160
of enchantment,

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,960
and the finest merchandise this side
of the river Jordan, on sale today.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Look at this. Yes.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
Will not break. Will not...

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
It broke.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,080
Ohh! Look at this.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,800
I have never seen
one of these intact before.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,440
Listen. Ah, still good.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
Wait. Don't go.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,560
I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,640
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,800
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,960
but what is inside that counts.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
This is no ordinary lamp.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,560
It once changed the course
of a young man's life.

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,040
The diamond in the rough.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,280
Perhaps you would
like to hear the tale?

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
It begins on a dark night...

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,120
where a dark man waits

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
with a dark purpose.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,280
You are late.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,160
A thousand apologies, O Patient One.

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
You have it then?

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,840
I had to slit a few throats,
but I got it.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
Ah-ah-ahhh.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
The treasure.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,600
Ow!

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,440
Trust me, my pungent friend.

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,560
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,480
Quickly! Follow the trail.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Faster.

58
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,600
At last, after all
my years of searching...

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
the Cave of Wonders.

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,520
Awk. Cave of Wonders.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,080
By Allah.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,080
Now, remember.
Bring me the lamp.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,880
The rest of the treasure
is yours, but the lamp is mine.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,280
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Jeez, where'd ya dig
this bozo up?

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,120
Shh.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
Who disturbs my slumber?

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,640
It is l, Gazeem,

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,640
a humble thief.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Know this.

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Only one may enter here,

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,560
one whose worth lies far within.

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,560
A diamond in the rough.

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,680
What are you waiting for#Go on.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
No!

76
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,960
Seek thee out
the diamond in the rough.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,520
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,640
We're never gonna get
a hold of that stupid lamp.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,200
Just forget it.
Look at this.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,400
Patience, lago. Patience.

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,080
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, there's a big surprise.

84
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,600
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,160
What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big...

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Yes.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Only one may enter.

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
I must find this one, this...

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
diamond in the rough.

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,400
Stop! Thief!

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Stop! Thief!

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll have your hands
for a trophy, street rat.

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,280
All this for a loaf of bread?

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,920
Whoa!

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,760
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,800
You think that was easy?

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,120
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,880
Getting into trouble a little early
today, aren't we, Aladdin?

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
Trouble. No way. You're only
in trouble if you get caught.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.

102
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
And this time...

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,440
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,080
<i>Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line</i>

106
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,160
<i>One swing ahead of the sword</i>

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,720
<i>I steal only what I can't afford</i>

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
That's everything.

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,600
<i>One jump ahead of the lawmen</i>

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
<i>That's all and that's no joke</i>

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,640
<i>These guys don't appreciate I'm broke</i>

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
- Riffraff.
- Street rat.

113
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,840
- Scoundrel.
- Take that.

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,720
<i>Just a little snack, guys</i>

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,480
<i>Rip him open
Take it back, guys</i>

116
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,440
<i>I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts</i>

117
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
- <i>You're my only friend, Abu</i>
- Who?

118
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,080
<i>Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom</i>

119
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,680
<i>He's become a one-man rise in crime</i>

120
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,560
<i>I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em</i>

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
<i>Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat</i>

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,760
<i>Tell you all about it
When I got the time</i>

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,400
<i>One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom</i>

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
<i>Next time gonna use a nom de plume</i>

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,760
There he is.

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,640
<i>One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock</i>

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,320
<i>I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block</i>

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,240
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
- Abu!
- Scandal.

130
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,960
<i>Let's not be too hasty</i>

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,840
<i>Still I think he's rather tasty</i>

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
<i>Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat</i>

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
<i>Otherwise we'd get along</i>

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,520
Wrong.

135
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
Get him!

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
He's got a sword!

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,600
You idiots.
We've all got swords.

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
- <i>One jump ahead of the hoofbeats</i>
- Vandal!

139
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,600
- <i>One hop ahead of the hump</i>
- Street rat!

140
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
- <i>One trick ahead of disaster</i>
- Scoundrel!

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
<i>They're quick, but I'm much faster</i>

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
<i>Here goes, better throw my hand in</i>

143
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,200
<i>Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump</i>

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,960
Yuck! Oy!

145
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.

146
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
All right.

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,600
Yum, yum!

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
Uh-oh.

149
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,760
Here. Go on. Take it.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,040
Ah, don't. Huh?

151
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

152
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Another suitor for the princess.

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,560
- Out of my way, you filthy brats.

154
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,040
Hey!

155
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,680
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

156
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

157
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,840
Look at that, Abu.

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

159
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
Ooh!

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,480
You are a worthless street rat.

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,720
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
and only your fleas will mourn you.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm not worthless.

164
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
And I don't have fleas.

165
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,320
Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,120
<i>Riffraff, street rat</i>

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
<i>I don't buy that</i>

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,120
<i>If only they'd look closer</i>

169
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
<i>Would they see a poor boy</i>

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
<i>No, siree</i>

171
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,240
<i>They'd find out</i>

172
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,920
<i>There's so much more</i>

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
<i>To me</i>

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,880
Some day, Abu,
things are gonna change.

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,800
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

176
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,000
and never have any problems at all.

177
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
I've never been so insulted.

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,920
Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,040
Good luck marrying her off.

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh! Jasmine.

181
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,800
Jasmine!

182
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Jasmine!

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,720
- Jasmine!

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,840
Confound it, Rajah.

185
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
So, this is why Prince Achmed
stormed out.

186
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
Oh, Father.

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

188
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,520
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

189
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,240
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

190
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,360
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,120
The law says
you must be married to a prince...

192
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,080
by your next birthday.

193
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
The law is wrong.

194
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
You've only got three more days.

195
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,360
Father, I hate being forced into this.

196
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,600
If I do marry,
I want it to be for love.

197
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Jasmine...

198
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,880
it's not only this law.

199
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, l...

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

201
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Provided for.

202
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,960
Please try to understand.

203
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,080
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
Except you, Rajah.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,200
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.

206
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,640
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

207
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,520
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess anymore.

208
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
Oooh! I... I...

209
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
Hmm?

211
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't know where she gets it from.

212
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,280
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

213
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,760
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

214
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,240
My most trusted advisor.

215
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

216
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

217
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,440
It's this suitor business.

218
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Jasmine refuses
to choose a husband.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,880
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!

220
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Oh!

221
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,160
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

222
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,400
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

223
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,960
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,080
to this thorny problem.

225
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
If anyone can help, it's you.

226
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,680
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

227
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh. Uh, my ring?

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,880
But it's been in the family for years.

229
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

230
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't worry.

231
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Everything will be fine.

232
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,960
Everything will be... fine.

233
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
The diamond.

234
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,520
Here, Jafar.

235
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,920
Whatever you need will be fine.

236
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,600
You are most gracious, my liege.

237
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?

238
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Yes. That will be pretty good.

239
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
I can't take it anymore!

240
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,600
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

241
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Bam! Whack!

242
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,200
Calm yourself, lago.

243
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,480
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Whack!

244
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,240
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,480
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

246
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
Ha, ha!

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,240
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

248
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,320
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

249
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,280
I'll miss you.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
Goodbye.

251
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,040
Okay, Abu. Go.

252
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

253
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Get your paws off that.

254
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Why, you...

255
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

256
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
Goodbye.

257
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,120
Nice going, Abu.

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Breakfast is served.

259
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,880
Pretty lady, buy a pot.

260
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,200
No finer pot in brass or silver.

261
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Sugar dates.
Sugar dates and figs.

262
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,800
Sugar dates and pistachios.

263
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,600
Would the lady like a necklace?

264
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,120
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

265
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,520
Fresh fish!

266
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

267
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Oh, no. I don't think so.

268
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
Oh!

269
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,960
Excuse me.

270
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm really very sorry.

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,640
Wow.

272
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,560
Uh-oh.

273
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,600
Hello. Hello?

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
Oh, you must be hungry.

275
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Here you go.

276
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,680
You'd better be able to pay for that.

277
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800
Pay?

278
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
No one steals from my cart.

279
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

280
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,040
- Thief!
- Please...

281
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,000
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.

282
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,160
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,880
No! No, please!

284
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
I've been looking all over for you.

286
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,920
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,240
You, uh, know this girl?

288
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,800
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

289
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
She's a little crazy.

290
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,160
She said she knew the Sultan.

291
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,960
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

292
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,360
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

293
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Tragic, isn't it?

294
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,600
But no harm done.

295
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,400
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

296
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?

297
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,400
- No, no, no. Not that one.
- Come on, Sultan.

298
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
Huh. What?

299
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Come back here, you little thieves!

300
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,680
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,

301
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?

302
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
Save your breath, lago. Faster.

303
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,800
Yes, O mighty Evil One.

304
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,160
Part, sands of time.

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

306
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,480
Yes! Yes!

307
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,840
There he is.

308
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,200
My diamond in the rough.

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,680
That's him. That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

310
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,800
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

311
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
Swell.

312
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,120
Almost there.

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,480
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

314
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
Uh, forget it.

315
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

316
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Is it that obvious?

317
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,160
Well, you do kind of stand out.

318
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,400
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,960
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

320
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
Wow.

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
Hey.

322
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
Come on. This way.

323
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,640
Whoa. Watch your head there.

324
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
Be careful.

325
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,000
Is this where you live?

326
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,160
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

327
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,120
That sounds fabulous.

328
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,280
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

329
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

330
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, it's wonderful.

331
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,920
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

332
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
and have servants and valets.

333
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

334
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,400
It's better than here.

335
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,160
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

336
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
You're not free to make
your own choices.

337
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,920
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

338
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,160
...trapped.

339
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,240
So, where are you from?

340
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,840
What does it matter?

341
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,400
I ran away
and I am not going back.

342
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,960
Really. How come?

343
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,640
Why, you...

344
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,800
My father's forcing me
to get married.

345
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,560
That's... that's awful.

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,920
Abu!

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,120
What?

348
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,680
Abu says, uh...
that's not fair.

349
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
What?

350
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,200
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

351
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,880
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

352
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,320
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

353
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh, boy.

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,040
Hmm.

355
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,480
Tell him that's very sweet.

356
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,040
Here you are.

357
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,400
- They're after me! You?
- My father must have sent them...

358
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
- Do you trust me?
- What?

359
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,640
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

360
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
Then jump!

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,760
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

362
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,520
Run! Go! Get out of here!

363
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,960
Get this thing off of me!

364
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,800
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.

365
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,120
Let him go.

366
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,520
- Looky here, men. A street mouse.

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,040
Unhand him,
by order of the princess.

368
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Princess Jasmine.

369
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,800
- The princess?
- Princess?

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,800
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

371
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,520
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

372
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,640
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

373
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,480
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

374
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
Jafar?

375
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh, Princess.

376
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,480
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

377
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,680
How may I be of service to you?

378
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

379
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,120
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

380
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

381
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
I can't breathe, Jafar.

382
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

383
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,800
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!

384
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.

385
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Oh, dear.

386
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

387
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
What do you mean?

388
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

389
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,760
What sentence?

390
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
Death.

391
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,680
- By beheading.
- No.

392
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,560
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

393
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,200
How could you?

394
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
So, how did it go?

395
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,280
I think she took it... rather well.

396
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,160
It's all my fault, Rajah.

397
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
- I didn't even know his name.

398
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
She was the princess.

399
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,040
I can't believe it.

400
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,360
I must have sounded
so stupid to her.

401
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,720
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!

402
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
Hello!

403
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,760
Abu. Down here.

404
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,920
Come on, help me out of these.

405
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,200
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

406
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Don't worry.
I'll never see her again.

408
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

409
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
She's gotta marry a prince.

410
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,840
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

411
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm a fool.

412
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,760
You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

413
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,040
Who are you?

414
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,400
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

415
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,280
But together,
perhaps we can be more.

416
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm listening.

417
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,400
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

418
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

419
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Ooh!

420
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,080
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'd wager.

421
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,640
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

422
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,200
But the law says only a prince can...

423
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,000
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

424
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,400
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.

425
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,040
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

426
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,480
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to go in after it.

427
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,160
Uh, one problem.

428
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
It's out there.
We're in here.

429
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
Uh-uh. Things aren't always
what they seem.

430
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,600
So...

431
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
do we have a deal?

432
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
Oh, I don't know.

433
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Who disturbs my slumber?

434
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
Uh, it is l, Aladdin.

435
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,880
Proceed.

436
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,840
Touch nothing but the lamp.

437
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Remember, boy,
first fetch me the lamp,

438
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,880
and then you shall
have your reward.

439
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
Come on, Abu.

440
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,640
Would you look at that!

441
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,560
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the Sultan.

442
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
Abu!

443
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,200
Don't... touch... anything.

444
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,880
We gotta find that lamp.

445
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,280
Huh?

446
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,080
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?

447
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,680
Abu, what are you, crazy?

448
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,800
A magic carpet.

449
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,160
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

450
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,440
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

451
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
Thanks.

452
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,520
Wait a minute. Don't go.

453
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440
Maybe you can help us.

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,080
Hey! Whoa!

455
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,640
You see, we're trying
to find this lamp.

456
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,880
I think he knows where it is.

457
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,600
Wait here.

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Oh!

459
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
This is it?

460
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,840
This is what we came
all the way down here to...

461
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,760
Abu! No!

462
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,200
- lnfidels!
- Uh-oh.

463
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,120
You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

464
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,320
Now you will never again
see the light of day!

465
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,080
Whoa!

466
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,680
Help! Help! Help!

467
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
Gotcha!

468
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
Carpet, let's move.

469
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Abu!

470
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Abu, this is no time to panic.

471
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,680
Start panicking.

472
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Whoa!

473
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,720
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.

474
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,240
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.

475
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,040
First give me the lamp.

476
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,800
Yes!

477
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,200
At last!

478
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
What are you doing?

479
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,040
Giving you your reward.

480
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,840
Your eternal reward.

481
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
It's mine.

482
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,600
It's all mine.

483
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,320
I... where is it?

484
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,560
No.

485
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
No!

486
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,280
Jasmine?

487
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh, dearest.

488
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,120
What's wrong?

489
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,560
Jafar has...

490
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,920
done something terrible.

491
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,680
There, there, my dear.

492
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,040
We'll set it right.

493
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,480
Now, tell me everything.

494
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,880
Oh.

495
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
Aladdin. Wake up.

496
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,080
Aladdin.

497
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,840
Oh! My head.

498
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,080
We're trapped.

499
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,080
That two-faced son of a jackal!

500
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,760
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

501
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,960
Aha!

502
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,680
Why, you hairy little thief.

503
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,240
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

504
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,680
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

505
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,920
but it's hard to make out.

506
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,600
Aaaaahhhhh!

507
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,760
Oy!

508
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,320
10,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

509
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,760
Hang on a second.

510
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,720
Whoa! Whoa!

511
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
Does it feel good
to be outta there.

512
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Nice to be back,
ladies and gentlemen.

513
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,960
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

514
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,440
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

515
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,320
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

516
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybe just "Din."

517
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,000
How about "Laddie"?
Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie."

518
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,600
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

519
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,480
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

520
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

521
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,760
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

522
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,280
Give me some tass-el.
Yeah. Yo, yo.

523
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,720
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

524
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,160
That or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look from the side. Do I look different?

525
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,200
Wait a minute.
I'm your master?

526
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,120
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

527
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,400
The ever impressive,

528
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,200
the long contained,

529
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,560
often imitated,

530
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,520
but never duplicated...

531
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Duplicated, duplicated...

532
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
Genie...

533
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
of the Lamp!

534
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,280
Right here direct from the lamp,

535
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,640
right here for your
very much wish fulfillment.

536
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,040
Thank you.

537
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,720
Whoa. Wish fulfillment?

538
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,160
Three wishes to be exact.

539
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,880
And ix-nay on the wishing
for more wishes.

540
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,720
That's it. Three.
Uno, dos, tres.

541
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.

542
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,200
Now I know I'm dreaming.

543
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,200
Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.

544
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,440
So why don't you just ruminate

545
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,360
whilst I illuminate
the possibilities.

546
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,760
<i>Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves</i>

547
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,560
<i>Scheherazade had a thousand tales</i>

548
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,440
<i>But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves</i>

549
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,800
<i>You got a brand of magic never fails</i>

550
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,160
<i>You got some power in your corner now</i>

551
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,440
<i>Some heavy ammunition in your camp</i>

552
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,880
<i>You got some punch pizzazz
Yahoo and how</i>

553
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,480
<i>See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say</i>

554
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,800
<i>Mr. Aladdin, sir,
What will your pleasure be</i>

555
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,240
<i>Let me take your order
Jot it down</i>

556
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,120
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>

557
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,240
<i>Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'</i>

558
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,960
<i>Come on, whisper what it is you want</i>

559
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,920
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>

560
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,480
<i>Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service</i>

561
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,640
<i>You're the boss, the king, the shah</i>

562
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,360
<i>Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish</i>

563
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,920
<i>How 'bout a little more baklava ?</i>

564
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,200
<i>Have some of column A
Try all of column B</i>

565
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,840
<i>I'm in the mood to help you, dude</i>

566
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,080
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>

567
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,280
<i>Can your friends do this ?</i>

568
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,200
<i>Can your friends do that ?</i>

569
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
<i>Can your friends pull this</i>

570
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,160
<i>Out their little hat ?</i>

571
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,560
<i>Can your friends go poof ?</i>

572
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,240
Hey, looky here. Ha ha!

573
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,720
<i>Can your friends go
Abracadabra, let her rip</i>

574
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
<i>And then make the sucker disappear</i>

575
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,600
<i>So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed</i>

576
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
<i>I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers</i>

577
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
<i>You got me bona fide certified</i>

578
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,200
<i>You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires</i>

579
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,560
<i>I got a powerful urge to help you out</i>

580
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,040
<i>So what's your wish
I really wanna know</i>

581
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,720
<i>You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt</i>

582
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,920
<i>All you gotta do is rub like so</i>

583
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,680
<i>Mr. Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three</i>

584
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,120
<i>I'm on the job, you big nabob</i>

585
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,120
<i>You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend</i>

586
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,360
<i>You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend</i>

587
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
<i>You ain't never</i>

588
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
<i>Had a</i>

589
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,240
<i>Friend</i>

590
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
<i>Like</i>

591
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,240
<i>Me</i>

592
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,720
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>

593
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,440
Huh?

594
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,560
So, what'll it be, Master?

595
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,800
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

596
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
Ah, almost.

597
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,160
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

598
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,200
Like?

599
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,600
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anybody.

600
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,880
So don't ask.

601
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,280
Rule number two.

602
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,200
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

603
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,200
You little punim there.

604
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,400
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

605
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,600
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

606
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
Other than that, you got it.

607
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,680
- Hmm.
- Oh!

608
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,680
Provisos?
You mean limitations?

609
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
On wishes?
Some all-powerful genie.

610
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,240
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

611
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,840
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

612
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out.

613
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,000
Excuse me?

614
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,920
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

615
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,680
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

616
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
And you're walking out on me?

617
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,840
I don't think so,
not right now.

618
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
You're gettin' your wishes,
so sit down!

619
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,480
In case of emergency,

620
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,800
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

621
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,400
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

622
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,360
We're...

623
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,880
outta here!

624
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,280
Jafar, this is an outrage.

625
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,240
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

626
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,200
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

627
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,720
before they are beheaded.

628
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,640
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

629
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Jasmine...

630
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,880
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

631
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,000
Please.

632
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,000
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

633
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,200
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

634
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,240
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.

635
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,440
That's nice.
All settled, then.

636
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,600
Now, Jasmine, getting back to
this suitor business... Jasmine?

637
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,760
Jasmine!

638
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,360
If only I had gotten that lamp.

639
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
"l will have the power
to get rid of you."

640
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,520
To think
we gotta keep kissing up

641
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,400
to that chump
and his chump daughter

642
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,040
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, lago.

643
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,560
Only until she finds
a chump husband.

644
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,440
Then she'll have us banished.

645
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,000
Or beheaded.

646
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
Oh. Wait a minute.

647
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
Jafar. What if you were
the chump husband?

648
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
What?

649
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
Okay, you marry
the princess, all right?

650
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,080
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.

651
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,440
Oh.

652
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,960
Marry the shrew.

653
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,360
I become the sultan.

654
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,320
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

655
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,040
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

656
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,560
Yaaah!

657
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Kersplat!

658
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,280
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

659
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,640
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

660
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

661
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,360
Thank you.
Goodbye now. Good-ye.

662
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,480
Thank you.

663
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,480
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

664
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,200
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

665
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Dost mine ears deceive me?

666
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,760
Three. You are down by one, boy.

667
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,440
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

668
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,200
You did that on your own.

669
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,920
Well, I feel sheepish.

670
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,120
All right, you baaad boy,
but no more freebies.

671
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,360
Fair deal.
So, three wishes.

672
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,360
I want them to be good.

673
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,080
What would you wish for?

674
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,040
Me?

675
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,240
No one's ever asked me that before.

676
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,120
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.

677
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,080
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

678
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,360
Come on. Tell me.

679
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
Freedom.

680
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,400
You're a prisoner?

681
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,840
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

682
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

683
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,880
Itty bitty living space.

684
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,040
Genie, that's terrible.

685
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,520
But, oh, to be free.

686
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,840
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

687
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

688
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,360
To be my own master.

689
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,080
Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic

690
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,720
and all the treasures
in all the world.

691
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,600
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.

692
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,040
It's not gonna happen.

693
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,200
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

694
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,560
Why not?

695
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,320
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

696
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,680
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

697
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,400
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

698
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,640
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

699
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,440
after I make my first two wishes,

700
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,680
I'll use my third wish
to set you free.

701
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,760
Well, here's hopin'.
All right.

702
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,080
Let's make some magic.

703
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,760
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

704
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,520
Well, there's this girl.

705
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,840
Wrong.

706
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,360
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

707
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,840
Oh, but, Genie,

708
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,720
she's smart and fun and...

709
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,680
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

710
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,160
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair. Wow.

711
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,480
And her smile...

712
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,760
<i>Ami.</i>

713
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
<i>C'est l'amour.</i>

714
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
But she's the princess.

715
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,920
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...

716
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
Hey, can you make me a prince?

717
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,320
Let's see here.

718
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,080
Chicken Ã  la king? Nope.

719
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,240
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

720
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,840
Caesar salad. Ah!
Et tu, Brute. No.

721
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,000
Aha. "To make a prince."

722
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,200
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

723
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,000
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

724
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,680
All right!

725
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,040
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

726
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,320
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

727
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,680
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

728
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,160
No. Let's work with me here.

729
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

730
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,040
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

731
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,800
It says mode of transportation.

732
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,600
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqui. Over here.

733
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,520
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.

734
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,560
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

735
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,360
than riding your very own
brand-new camel.

736
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.

737
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,800
Still not enough.

738
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,560
Let's see.
What do you need?

739
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,160
Yes!

740
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,480
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo !

741
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,480
Whoa!

742
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

743
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Abu, you look good.

744
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,960
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

745
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,920
But we're not through yet.

746
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,440
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

747
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,480
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

748
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,000
Awk. The problem with your daughter.

749
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,240
Oh, really?

750
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,400
Right here.

751
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,280
"lf the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

752
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,560
then the sultan shall
choose for her."

753
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,360
But Jasmine hated
all those suitors.

754
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,560
How could I choose
someone she hates?

755
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,480
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.

756
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,360
"lf in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found,"

757
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,400
Jerk.

758
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,320
"a princess must then be wed to..."

759
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,680
Hmm. Interesting.

760
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,440
What? Who?

761
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,080
The royal vizier.

762
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,520
Why, that would be... me.

763
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,280
But I thought the law says

764
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,600
that only a prince
can marry a princess.

765
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm quite sure that...

766
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,920
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, my lord.

767
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,040
Yes. Desperate measures.

768
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,080
You will order
the princess to marry me.

769
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,320
I will order...

770
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,000
the princess...

771
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,200
to...

772
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,600
But you're so old.

773
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,960
The princess will marry me.

774
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,600
The princess will marry...

775
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,360
- What. What is that?

776
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,760
That music.

777
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
Jafar, you must come
and see this.

778
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,960
<i>Make way for Prince Ali</i>

779
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,280
<i>Say hey</i>

780
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,560
<i>It's Prince Ali</i>

781
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,560
<i>Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar</i>

782
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,280
<i>Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star</i>

783
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,480
<i>Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye</i>

784
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,840
<i>Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums</i>

785
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,440
<i>You're gonna love this guy</i>

786
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,840
<i>Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa</i>

787
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,280
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee

788
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,640
<i>Now, try your best to stay calm</i>

789
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,240
<i>Brush up your Sunday salaam</i>

790
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,880
<i>Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie</i>

791
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,720
<i>Prince Ali, mighty is he,
Ali Ababwa</i>

792
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,640
<i>Strong as ten regular men definitely</i>

793
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,440
<i>He faced the galloping hordes</i>

794
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,680
<i>A hundred bad guys with swords</i>

795
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,560
<i>Who sent those goons to their lords
Why, Prince Ali</i>

796
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,240
<i>He's got 75 golden camels</i>

797
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,720
Don't they look lovely, June?

798
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,320
<i>Purple peacocks, he's got 53</i>

799
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,200
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.

800
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,800
<i>When it comes to exotic-type mammals</i>

801
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,120
<i>Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you</i>

802
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,640
<i>It's a world-class menagerie</i>

803
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,400
<i>Prince Ali, handsome is he,
Ali Ababwa
<font color=#FF8080>There's no question this Ali's alluring</font></i>

804
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,160
<i>That physique, how can I speak,
weak at the knee
<font color=#FF8080>Never ordinary, never boring
        Everything about the man just plain impresses</font></i>

805
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,920
<i>Well, get on out in that square
<font color=#FF8080>He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder</font></i>

806
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
<i>Adjust your veil and prepare
<font color=#FF8080>He's about to pull my heart asunder</font></i>

807
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,040
<i>To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali
<font color=#FF8080>And I absolutely love the way he dresses !</font></i>

808
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,800
<i>- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- He's got the monkeys</i>

809
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,920
<i>- Let's see the monkeys
- And to view them he charges no fee</i>

810
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,240
<i>He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies</i>

811
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
<i>Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him</i>

812
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,120
<i>They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali</i>

813
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,080
<i>Prince Ali</i>

814
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:41,040
<i>Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa</i>

815
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,560
<i>Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see</i>

816
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,880
<i>And that, good people, is why</i>

817
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,560
<i>He got dolled up and dropped by</i>

818
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,360
<i>With 60 elephants, llamas galore</i>

819
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
<i>With bears and lions,
A brass band and more</i>

820
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,240
<i>With his 40 fakirs,
His cooks, his bakers</i>

821
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,640
<i>His birds that warble on key</i>

822
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,760
<i>Make way</i>

823
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,880
<i>For Prince Ali</i>

824
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,240
Splendid.
Absolutely marvelous.

825
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,520
Your Majesty,

826
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,400
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

827
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,400
Prince Ali Ababwa.

828
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,000
Of course.
I'm delighted to meet you.

829
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,160
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

830
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,360
Ecstatic.

831
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,120
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
- Ababwa.

832
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,480
Whatever.

833
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,400
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

834
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,640
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

835
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,160
Ooh.

836
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,720
I don't suppose I might...

837
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,320
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

838
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,360
Sire, I must advise against this.

839
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,560
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

840
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,120
Ow, ow, ow.

841
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Ahh! Whoa!

842
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,920
Just where did you say
you were from?

843
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,800
Oh, much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

844
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,760
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.

845
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,800
Hey, watch it.

846
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,920
Watch it with the dumb rug.

847
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,880
Aah!

848
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Whew!

849
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,520
Out of the way.
I'm coming in to land.

850
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,000
Jafar, watch this.

851
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,320
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

852
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,240
Yes, I do seem
to have a knack for it.

853
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,560
This is a very impressive youth.

854
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,920
And a prince besides.

855
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,400
If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

856
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,080
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

857
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,240
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,

858
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,240
I'm an excellent judge of character.

859
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,240
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!

860
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,360
Jasmine will like this one.

861
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,840
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

862
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,600
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

863
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,720
This boy is no different
from the others.

864
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,640
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

865
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,480
Your Majesty,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

866
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,720
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

867
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,160
How dare you.

868
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,000
All of you. Standing around
deciding my future?

869
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,760
I am not a prize to be won.

870
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,200
Oh, dear.

871
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,600
Don't worry, Prince Ali.

872
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,200
Just give Jasmine time
to cool down.

873
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,320
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abooboo.

874
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,840
What am I gonna do?

875
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
Jasmine won't even
let me talk to her.

876
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,640
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

877
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,360
So move.

878
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,320
Hey.

879
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,600
That's a good move.

880
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,160
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.

881
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
Genie, I need help.

882
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,440
All right, Sparky,
here's the deal.

883
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,440
If you wanna court
the little lady,

884
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,360
you gotta be
a straight shooter.

885
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,280
- Do you got it?
- What?

886
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,400
Tell her the...

887
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,240
- ... truth!
- No way.

888
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,960
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

889
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,000
she'd laugh at me.

890
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,440
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

891
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,480
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

892
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,480
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

893
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

894
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,960
I just... I gotta be smooth,
cool, confident.

895
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
How do I look?

896
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,280
Like a prince.

897
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,560
Princess Jasmine?

898
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,480
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

899
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,800
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

900
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,520
I do not want to see you.

901
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

902
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,480
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

903
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,960
So, how's our little beau doing?

904
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,640
Good kitty, take off.

905
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,120
Down, kitty.

906
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,200
Wait. Wait.

907
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,600
Do I know you?

908
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,000
Uh, no. No.

909
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,200
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

910
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,680
The marketplace?

911
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,520
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

912
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants.

913
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,800
It couldn't have been me you met.

914
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,360
No. I guess not.

915
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,920
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

916
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,640
She's smart, fun,
the hair, the eyes.

917
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,200
Anything. Pick a feature.

918
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,080
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

919
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,360
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
- ... punctual.

920
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,520
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

921
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,800
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

922
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,880
Hmm.

923
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,080
I'm rich, too, you know.

924
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,960
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

925
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,960
I know.

926
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
A fine prize
for any prince to marry.

927
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,440
Uh, right. Right.
A prince like me.

928
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,640
Warning! Warning!

929
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
Right. A prince like you.

930
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,160
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

931
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,760
Mayday! Mayday!

932
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,360
Just go jump off
a balcony!

933
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,520
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

934
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,840
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

935
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,400
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

936
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,200
- Yeah, right.
- What?

937
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,400
Uh... Uh, you're right.

938
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,520
You aren't just
some prize to be won.

939
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,280
You should be free
to make your own choice.

940
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,600
I'll go now.

941
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,440
- No!
- What? What?

942
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,720
How...

943
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,240
How are you doing that?

944
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,800
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

945
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,680
You, uh...

946
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,960
You don't want to go
for a ride, do you?

947
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,200
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

948
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,320
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

949
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,040
- What?
- Do you trust me?

950
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
Yes.

951
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:15,880
Yes.

952
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,560
<i>I can show you the world</i>

953
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,800
<i>Shining, shimmering, splendid</i>

954
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,400
<i>Tell me, Princess</i>

955
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,200
<i>Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide</i>

956
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,080
<i>I can open your eyes</i>

957
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,360
<i>Take you wonder by wonder</i>

958
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,120
<i>Over, sideways and under</i>

959
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,920
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>

960
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,680
<i>A whole new world</i>

961
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,280
<i>A new fantastic point of view</i>

962
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,840
<i>No one to tell us no
Or where to go</i>

963
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,520
<i>Or say we're only dreaming</i>

964
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,280
<i>A whole new world</i>

965
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,240
<i>A dazzling place
I never knew</i>

966
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,600
<i>But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear</i>

967
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,880
<i>That now I'm in
A whole new world with you</i>

968
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,160
<i>Now I'm in
A whole new world with you</i>

969
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,000
<i>Unbelievable sights</i>

970
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,480
<i>Indescribable feeling</i>

971
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,480
<i>Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling</i>

972
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,520
<i>Through an endless diamond sky</i>

973
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,000
<i>- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes</i>

974
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,280
<i>- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better</i>

975
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,720
<i>I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far</i>

976
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
<i>I can't go back to where I used to be</i>

977
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,800
<i>- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise</i>

978
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,520
<i>- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment, red-letter</i>

979
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,960
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

980
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,480
<i>Let me share
This whole new world with you</i>

981
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,360
<i>- A whole new world
- A whole new world</i>

982
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,240
- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be

983
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,960
<i>- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place</i>

984
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,840
<i>For you and me</i>

985
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,120
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

986
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,040
It's a shame
Abu had to miss this.

987
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,200
Nah. He hates fireworks.

988
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,200
He doesn't like flying, either.

989
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,000
Uh, that is, um...
Oh, no.

990
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,160
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

991
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,640
- Why did you lie?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

992
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,560
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

993
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,480
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

994
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,160
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

995
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,160
Who are you?
Tell me the truth.

996
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,000
The truth?

997
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,360
The truth. Um...

998
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,720
The truth is...

999
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,400
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um...

1000
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,000
to escape the pressures
of palace life.

1001
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,520
But I really am a prince.

1002
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,000
Why didn't you just tell me?

1003
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,640
Well, you know...

1004
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,840
royalty going out
into the city in disguise,

1005
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,640
it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

1006
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,320
Hmm.

1007
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,800
Not that strange.

1008
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,520
Good night, my handsome prince.

1009
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,280
Sleep well, Princess.

1010
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,960
Yes!

1011
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,360
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

1012
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,440
Abu. Abu.

1013
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,600
Hold him.

1014
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,480
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abooboo.

1015
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,960
Why, you...

1016
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,160
Make sure he's never found.

1017
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Never fails. Get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

1018
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,360
Hello? Al?

1019
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,000
Al! Kid, snap out of it.

1020
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,600
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

1021
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,600
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?

1022
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,920
Come on, Aladdin!

1023
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,360
I'll take that as a yes.

1024
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,240
Up scope.

1025
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,040
Don't you scare me like that.

1026
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,600
Genie, l, uh...

1027
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,760
I...

1028
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,440
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

1029
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,640
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

1030
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,240
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

1031
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,000
Jasmine.

1032
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,120
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

1033
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,240
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

1034
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,600
I have chosen a husband for you.

1035
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,400
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

1036
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,960
You're speechless, I see.

1037
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,840
A fine quality in a wife.

1038
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,680
I will never marry you.

1039
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,360
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

1040
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,600
Better check your
crystal ball again, Jafar.

1041
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,320
Prince Ali!

1042
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,960
How in the... uh. Awk!

1043
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,480
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

1044
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,560
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

1045
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,760
He is obviously lying.

1046
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,200
Obviously lying.

1047
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Father, what's wrong with you?

1048
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,080
I know what's wrong.

1049
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh, my!

1050
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,640
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

1051
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,560
What? Jafar?

1052
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,520
You, you traitor!

1053
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,720
Your Majesty,
all this can be explained.

1054
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,600
Guards! Guards!

1055
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,240
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.

1056
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,400
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

1057
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,800
Arrest Jafar at once.

1058
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,280
This is not done yet, boy.

1059
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,360
Find him!

1060
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,160
- Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?

1061
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,160
Yes.

1062
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,520
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,

1063
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,600
plotting against me all this time.

1064
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,720
This is horrible, just horrible.

1065
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,960
How will I ever...

1066
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,960
Huh?

1067
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,720
Can this be true?

1068
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,280
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

1069
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,440
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

1070
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,360
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.

1071
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,560
I won't.
I'll leave that to my...

1072
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,320
But you two will be wed at once.

1073
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

1074
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,160
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

1075
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,560
- Sultan?
- Yes.

1076
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,680
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

1077
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,120
a person of your
unimpeachable moral character

1078
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,560
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1079
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,120
We gotta get outta here.

1080
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,480
I gotta start packing.
Only essentials.

1081
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,840
We gotta travel light.

1082
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,720
Bring the guns, the weapons,
and how about this picture?

1083
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,480
I think I'm making a weird face in it.

1084
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,680
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.

1085
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,800
Jafar! Jafar!

1086
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,200
Get a grip!

1087
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,080
Good grip.

1088
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,920
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

1089
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,120
- He has the lamp, lago.
- Why, that miserable...

1090
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,840
But you are going
to relieve him of it.

1091
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,840
Me?

1092
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,440
Sultan?

1093
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,560
They want me to be Sultan?

1094
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,560
Huzzah!

1095
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,280
#Hail the conquering hero#

1096
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,480
Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.

1097
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
What are you gonna do next?

1098
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,120
Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

1099
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Anytime.

1100
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,520
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.

1101
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,960
You just go,
"Genie, I wish you free."

1102
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,040
I'm serious.

1103
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,960
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

1104
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,520
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.

1105
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,800
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.

1106
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,920
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

1107
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,280
The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

1108
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,440
What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

1109
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,280
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.

1110
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,480
Genie, I can't
keep this up on my own.

1111
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,200
I can't wish you free.

1112
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,960
Fine. I understand.
You've lied to everyone else.

1113
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,720
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

1114
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,200
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master.

1115
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,800
Genie, I'm really sorry.

1116
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,520
Well, fine.
Then just stay in there.

1117
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,400
What are you guys looking at?

1118
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,520
Look, l... I'm sorry.

1119
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,560
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1120
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,560
Wait. Come on.

1121
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,160
What am I doing?

1122
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,680
Genie's right.

1123
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,160
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

1124
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,440
Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?

1125
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,800
Well, here goes.

1126
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,960
Jasmine?
Where are you?

1127
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,720
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

1128
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,760
I'm coming.

1129
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,320
You got a problem, Pinky?

1130
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,040
Jerk.

1131
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,440
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.

1132
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,320
- Excellent work, lago.
- Ah, go on.

1133
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,320
No, really. On a scale of
one to ten, you are an eleven.

1134
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

1135
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,680
I'm embarrassed.
I'm blushing.

1136
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,520
People of Agrabah,

1137
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,560
my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.

1138
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,000
Jasmine.

1139
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,960
Ali, where have you been?

1140
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,200
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

1141
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,120
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

1142
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,400
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.

1143
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,400
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.

1144
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,200
...Ali Ababwa!

1145
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,880
Oh, boy.

1146
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,520
Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.

1147
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:29,680
Let them cheer.

1148
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,800
Let them cheer.

1149
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,720
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

1150
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,200
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

1151
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,440
will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.

1152
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,240
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

1153
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,200
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1154
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,960
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

1155
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,920
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.

1156
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,800
What is this?

1157
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,880
What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

1158
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,920
Father.

1159
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,000
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

1160
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,920
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

1161
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Oh, yeah?
We'll just see about that.

1162
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,840
The lamp.

1163
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,160
Finders keepers, Abooboo.

1164
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,400
Genie, no!

1165
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,920
Sorry, kid.
I got a new master now.

1166
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,040
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1167
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,160
Ah, but there's a new order now.

1168
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,960
My order.

1169
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,960
Finally, you will bow to me.

1170
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,880
We will never bow to you.

1171
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,000
Why am I not surprised?

1172
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,440
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1173
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,560
then you will cower
before a sorcerer!

1174
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,840
Genie, my second wish...

1175
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,080
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world!

1176
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,040
Genie, stop!

1177
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

1178
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,320
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

1179
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,280
Now, where were we?

1180
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,800
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

1181
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,920
Down, boy.

1182
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,200
Oh, Princess.

1183
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,040
There's someone I'm dying
to introduce you to.

1184
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,640
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

1185
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,640
<i>Prince Ali
Yes, it is he</i>

1186
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,760
<i>But not as you know him</i>

1187
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,880
<i>Read my lips
And come to grips with reality</i>

1188
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,960
<i>Yes, meet a blast from your past</i>

1189
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,400
<i>Whose lies were too good to last</i>

1190
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,800
<i>Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali</i>

1191
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,360
Or should we say Aladdin?

1192
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,400
Ali?

1193
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,560
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I'm just...

1194
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,880
<i>So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin</i>

1195
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,000
<i>Just a con, need I go on</i>

1196
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,280
<i>Take it from me</i>

1197
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,520
<i>His personality flaws</i>

1198
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,560
<i>Give me adequate cause</i>

1199
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,400
<i>To send him packing
On a one-way trip</i>

1200
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,720
<i>So his prospects
Take a terminal dip</i>

1201
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,760
<i>His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!</i>

1202
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,120
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.

1203
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,040
<i>Ex-Prince Ali</i>

1204
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,640
Abu.

1205
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,760
Abu!

1206
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,680
Oh, this is all my fault.

1207
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,760
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance. Abu.

1208
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,160
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1209
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,080
I'm sorry, Abu.

1210
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,760
I made a mess of everything.

1211
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,280
Somehow... I gotta go back
and set things right.

1212
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,720
Carpet.

1213
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,240
Abu, start digging.

1214
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,360
That's it.

1215
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,800
Yeah! All right!

1216
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,640
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.

1217
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,040
Puppet ruler want a cracker?

1218
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,800
Here's your cracker.
Shoved all the way down your throat.

1219
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,120
Here. Have lots.

1220
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,680
Stop it.
Jafar, leave him alone.

1221
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,560
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

1222
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,760
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

1223
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,520
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

1224
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,440
What do you say, my dear?

1225
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,160
Why, with you as my queen...

1226
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Never.

1227
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,840
I'll teach you some respect.

1228
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,600
No. Genie.

1229
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,040
I have decided
to make my final wish.

1230
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,000
I wish for Princess Jasmine

1231
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,920
to fall desperately
in love with me.

1232
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,320
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quo...

1233
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,360
Don't talk back to me,
you big blue lout.

1234
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,240
You will do what
I order you to do, slave.

1235
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,160
Jafar.

1236
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,880
I never realized how...
incredibly handsome you are.

1237
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,120
Mmm. That's better.

1238
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,760
Now, pussycat...

1239
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,720
tell me more about myself.

1240
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,680
You're tall...

1241
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,000
dark...

1242
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,000
well dressed...

1243
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,320
Al. Al, little buddy.

1244
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,840
Shh.

1245
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,560
Al, I can't help you.

1246
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,280
I work for Señor Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

1247
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,240
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

1248
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,720
...cute little gaps
between your teeth.

1249
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,640
Go on.

1250
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,160
And your beard...

1251
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,240
is so... twisted.

1252
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,400
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jaf...!

1253
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,000
- And the street rat?

1254
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,720
What street rat?

1255
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,080
Yech!

1256
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,280
That was...

1257
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,400
You!

1258
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,560
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

1259
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,880
Get the lamp.

1260
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,880
No!

1261
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,520
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.

1262
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,200
Jasmine.

1263
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,880
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

1264
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,680
Don't toy with me.

1265
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,120
Abu!

1266
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,400
Things are unraveling
fast now, boy.

1267
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,800
Get the point?

1268
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,120
I'm just getting warmed up.

1269
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,520
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1270
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,400
A snake, am l?

1271
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,080
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1272
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,960
#Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake#

1273
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,520
You stay out of this.

1274
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,840
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... great!

1275
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,520
Aladdin.

1276
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,840
Jasmine, hang on.

1277
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,960
You little fool.

1278
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,120
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1279
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,280
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!

1280
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:32,200
Without the genie, boy,
you're nothing.

1281
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,320
The genie. The genie.

1282
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,120
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1283
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,200
What?

1284
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,560
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

1285
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,240
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1286
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,920
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

1287
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,240
You're right.

1288
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,960
His power does exceed my own.

1289
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,040
But not for long.

1290
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,120
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1291
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,720
One too many hits with the snake.

1292
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,560
Slave, I make my third wish.

1293
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,720
I wish to be
an all-powerful genie!

1294
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,880
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

1295
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,240
Yes.

1296
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,040
Yes!

1297
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,680
The power.

1298
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,400
The absolute power!

1299
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,560
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1300
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,560
The universe is mine to command,
to control!

1301
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,280
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1302
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,520
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie...

1303
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,840
you got it.

1304
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,120
What?

1305
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,440
And everything that goes with it.

1306
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,920
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

1307
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,920
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1308
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You're the genie. I don't want...

1309
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,320
Itty bitty living space.

1310
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,480
Al, you little genius, you.

1311
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,720
Ahh!

1312
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,200
Get your blasted beak
out of my face.

1313
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,400
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1314
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,720
Allow me.

1315
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,000
10,000 years in a Cave of Wonders
ought to chill him out.

1316
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,120
Shut up!

1317
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,960
Jasmine...

1318
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,400
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1319
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,000
I know why you did.

1320
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,640
Well, I guess...

1321
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,560
this is good-bye?

1322
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,720
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.

1323
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,360
I love you.

1324
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,200
Al, no problem.

1325
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,160
You've still got one wish left.

1326
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,360
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

1327
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,360
But, Genie,
what about your freedom?

1328
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,400
Hey, it's only
an eternity of servitude.

1329
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,360
This is love.

1330
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,640
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

1331
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,400
Believe me, I know.
I've looked.

1332
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,120
Jasmine, I do love you,

1333
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,880
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1334
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,160
I understand.

1335
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,760
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1336
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,800
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

1337
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,600
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1338
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,680
I'm free. I'm free.

1339
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,160
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

1340
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,360
Say, "l want the Nile." Try that.

1341
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,120
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

1342
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,080
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1343
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,280
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1344
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,720
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.

1345
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,480
I'm...

1346
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,440
Genie, I'm...

1347
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,000
I'm gonna miss you.

1348
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,240
Me, too, Al.

1349
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,280
No matter
what anybody says,

1350
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,280
you'll always be a prince to me.

1351
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,400
That's right.

1352
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,280
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1353
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,640
It's that law
that's the problem.

1354
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,840
- Father?
- Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan?

1355
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,440
From this day forth,

1356
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,000
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1357
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,440
Him. I choose...

1358
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,880
I choose you, Aladdin.

1359
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,760
Call me Al.

1360
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,240
Oh, all of ya, come over here.
Big group hug.

1361
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,840
Group hug.

1362
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,800
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1363
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,120
Ooh, hairball.

1364
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,120
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1365
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,080
I'm outta here!

1366
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,480
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1367
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,280
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I'm history.

1368
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,840
No, I'm mythology.

1369
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,800
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1370
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,120
#A whole new world#

1371
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,600
#A whole new life#

1372
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,160
#For you and me#

1373
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,480
#A whole new world #?

1374
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,400
Made you look.
