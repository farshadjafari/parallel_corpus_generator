1
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,473
The child is dead.

2
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,439
He breathed just for a moment.
Then he breathed no more.

3
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,513
The child is dead. Dead. The child is dead.

4
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,792
I'm afraid it will kill her.

5
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,677
My God, she wanted a baby so much.

6
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,028
For such a long time.

7
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,187
What can I tell her? What... will I say?

8
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,437
You could adopt a child.

9
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,274
She wanted her own.

10
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,153
If I may suggest...

11
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,628
...it even resembles...

12
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,153
Your wife need never know.

13
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,554
It would be a blessing to her...

14
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,228
...and to the child.

15
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,111
Are there no relatives?

16
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,191
None.

17
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,397
The mother died, as your own child...

18
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,829
...in the same moment.

19
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,673
You said it could be ours, but...

20
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,036
On this night, Mr. Thorn...

21
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,713
...God has given you a son.

22
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,478
Oh.

23
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,550
Here's your boy.

24
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,949
- Buongiorno.
- Good morning. Come va?

25
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,031
Bene.

26
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,838
- What are you doing home so early?
- Just came to start packing.

27
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,716
What?

28
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,872
We can't waste any time. We're leaving
in the morning. Buongiorno, Carlo.

29
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,235
Please, Carlo.

30
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,514
What are you talking about?

31
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,468
I am talking about London. I am talking about
the ambassador to the Court of St James.

32
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,473
- Well, what about him?
- You're married to him.

33
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,278
I'm what?

34
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,387
It's me. I'm appointed
ambassador to Great Britain.

35
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,475
I've already told them yes.
I loved it the minute I saw it.

36
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,550
Well, it's a bit much.

37
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,636
Well, nothing's too much for the wife
of the future president of the United States.

38
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,949
You know, you're pushy.

39
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,428
Come on. Wait till you see this.

40
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,668
Now, this... they call his day room.

41
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,750
His day room.

42
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,516
- So? How do you like it so far?
- Oh...

43
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,720
- Well, it needs some books. To warm it up.
- Couple of books. Warm it up. Yeah.

44
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,630
Mm.

45
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,115
- Something in mind, Mr. Ambassador?
- Why don't we have a little look upstairs?

46
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,112
Well, there's no furniture up there, either.

47
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,308
You know, you could be
too sexy for the White House.

48
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,871
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I won't be long.

49
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,269
We don't have that much to talk about.

50
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,239
Since when did two old college roommates
not have much to talk about?

51
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,471
Since one of them assumed
the awesome burden of the presidency.

52
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,758
- Well, give my regards to the first lady.
- I'll do my best.

53
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,791
Why don't you change you mind,
fly over with me?

54
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,554
No, I'd better stay here
and fool around with Damien.

55
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,278
- Where is he?
- He was right behind us...

56
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,150
Damien?

57
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,311
- Damien?
- Damien?

58
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,072
Damien!

59
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,431
Damien!

60
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,998
Damien!

61
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,990
Oh, my God, Robert.

62
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,719
Damien! Robert, where could he be?

63
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,915
Damien!

64
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,154
You little monkey!
Don't you ever do that again.

65
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,630
There you are.

66
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,834
- Go.
- Hooray!

67
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,350
- Run out of film?
- Just saving a bit for his canonization.

68
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,432
- How's that?
- He's either the heir to the Thorn millions...

69
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,557
...or Jesus Christ himself.
- Want a bite, Daddy?

70
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,755
Go on, Damien. Smile.
A big birthday smile.

71
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,674
Come on. Smile.

72
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,351
Holly!

73
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,393
- I'll take him, ma'am.
- No, I'll take him.

74
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,634
Come on.

75
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,312
One... two... three...

76
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,517
Let me jump on it, Daddy. Let me jump on it.

77
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,311
Hold on!

78
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,750
Damien!

79
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,510
Damien!

80
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,674
Damien, look at me!

81
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,909
I'm over here!

82
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,309
- Damien, I love you.
- Look. There's Nanny.

83
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,513
Look at me, Damien. It's all for you!

84
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,359
Oh, my God!

85
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,557
Go, Tom.

86
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,917
- Morning. Have you read the papers today?
- No, I haven't.

87
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,150
There was an article on the suicide,
your nanny that jumped.

88
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,835
- They say that she left a suicide note, sir.
- Not true.

89
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,673
Mr. Ambassador,
did you know she was on drugs?

90
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,193
Would you mind?

91
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,351
- Mr. Thorn, did she use drugs?
- Not that I know of.

92
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,274
- The article said...
- I don't care what the article said.

93
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,036
I'm sorry.

94
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,432
I am sorry.
Will you send me a bill for the damage?

95
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,196
No, that's all right, Mr. Ambassador.
Let's just say you owe me.

96
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,270
Corporal.

97
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,790
OK, outside.

98
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,955
Yes?

99
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,712
- There's a Father Brennan here to see you.
- Who?

100
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,109
A priest named Father Brennan from Rome.

101
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,669
He says it's a matter of
urgent personal business.

102
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,831
- Never heard of him.
- He says he just needs a minute.

103
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,913
- Something about a hospital.
- Donation time.

104
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,672
- All right, send him in.
- I didn't know you were such a soft touch.

105
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,070
On that trip to Saudi Arabia,
why isn't it the right time?

106
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,790
Well, it's personal, Tom. I just, uh...
don't feel like leaving home right now.

107
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,471
Yes, Father?

108
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,277
We haven't much time.
You must listen to what I have to say.

109
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,750
All right. What is it?

110
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,311
You must accept Christ as your savior.
You must accept him now.

111
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,871
Forgive me, but didn't I understand that you
have a matter of urgent personal business?

112
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,953
You must take Communion.
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh.

113
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,951
Only if he is within you
can you defeat the son of the devil.

114
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,509
- I see.
- He's killed once. He'll kill again.

115
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,159
He'll kill until everything that's yours is his.

116
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,914
- Father, would you mind...
- Only through Christ can you fight him.

117
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,195
Accept the Lord Jesus.

118
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,668
Drink his blood.

119
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,351
I've locked the door, Mr. Thorn.

120
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,318
- Yes?
- Would you send for a security guard?

121
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,357
I beg you, Mr. Thorn.
Listen to what I have to say.

122
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,908
Ambassador Thorn?

123
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,710
I was at the hospital, Mr. Thorn,
the night your son was born.

124
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,437
- I witnessed the birth.
- Sir?

125
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,229
I beg you.

126
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,073
All right. Stand by.

127
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,671
- What do you want?
- To save you, Mr. Thorn.

128
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,354
So Christ will forgive me.

129
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,952
What do you know about my son?

130
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,191
- Everything.
- And what is that?

131
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,751
I saw its mother.

132
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,115
- You saw my wife.
- I saw its mother.

133
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,998
- You're referring to my wife!
- Its mother, Mr. Thorn.

134
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,435
This is blackmail! Come out and say it.
What are you trying to say?

135
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,114
His mother was aja...

136
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,751
- Everything OK?
- You sounded strange. The door was locked.

137
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,958
- I want this gentleman escorted out of here.
- OK, let's go.

138
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,038
Accept Christ each day.

139
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,111
Drink his blood.

140
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,679
- Just get him off the grounds.
- All right, Father. Come on.

141
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,830
Father.

142
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,310
Thank you.

143
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,070
Come in.

144
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,916
Excuse me. Mrs. Baylock is here.

145
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,628
She says she's the new governess.

146
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,518
Well, that's a start. Show her in.

147
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,871
Come in, please.

148
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,757
- Ambassador and Mrs. Thorn.
- How do you do?

149
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,960
I, erm... I know it's a difficult time for you,
so I'll not intrude on your grief.

150
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,952
I'm here to take away
some of your troubles and anxieties.

151
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,430
We'll soon help your little boy
to forget what's happened.

152
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,353
I'm afraid, sir,
that some of our young nannies...

153
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,115
...they get homesick,
or they have boyfriend problems.

154
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,755
I left all that behind a long time ago.

155
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,469
Well, now, if you'll let me see your boy?

156
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,671
Yes, of course. He's upstairs.
I'll show you where it is.

157
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,788
Why don't you just leave us alone at first?
Let us get acquainted in our own way.

158
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,077
- Well, he's shy with new people.
- Oh, no. Not with me, he won't be.

159
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,112
- Well, I don't think...
- I think it'll be fine.

160
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,794
Go on. Give it a try.

161
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,316
All right, then.

162
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,867
- Mrs. Horton.
- This way, Mrs. Baylock.

163
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,951
Excuse me.

164
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,595
- I like her.
- She seems all right.

165
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,671
Where'd you find her?

166
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,590
- Where did I find her?
- Yeah.

167
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,036
I didn't find her. I assumed you found her.

168
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,349
Round that corner to the right
and it's the door facing you.

169
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,398
- I'll have your things sent up in a moment.
- Thank you.

170
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,635
- Oh, Mrs. Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

171
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,348
I'm sorry, but, uh... we're a little bit confused.

172
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,431
Oh? Why's that?

173
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,751
- Well, we don't know how you got here.
- Oh. The, er... the agency.

174
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,236
- The agency?
- Well, yes. They read in the paper about the...

175
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,433
...well, about your first nanny,
so they sent you another.

176
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,510
- Oh, that's it.
- I'll call to confirm that.

177
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,269
Oh, erm...

178
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,875
- Here are my references.
- Thank you very much.

179
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,910
Well, if... if I could see your boy... now?

180
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,588
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

181
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,435
Have no fear, little one.

182
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,509
I am here to protect thee.

183
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,509
- In a minute, Horton, I think.
- Very good, sir.

184
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,912
- Kathy!
- I'm coming! Mrs. Baylock.

185
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,150
- Mrs. Baylock!
- Yes, ma'am?

186
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,515
- Where's Damien?
- If you don't mind...

187
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,909
...I think he'd rather go to the park.

188
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,628
- The park? I told you he was going with us.
- He's too young for church.

189
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,076
- He'll cause a fuss.
- You don't seem to understand.

190
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,392
It is my wish and my husband's wish
that Damien accompanies us to church.

191
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,392
- Kathy!
- I'll be there in a minute!

192
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,836
Now, please have him dressed at once.

193
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,276
Well, excuse me
for speaking my mind, ma'am...

194
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,827
...but do you really think a five-year-old...

195
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,755
...will understand the goings-on
of an Episcopal wedding?

196
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:55,278
Will you have my son dressed and in the car
in five minutes? Thank you very much.

197
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,913
What's the matter, Damien?

198
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,877
Oh, it's just a church, that's all.

199
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,308
What's the matter?

200
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,230
- Robert.
- Something wrong?

201
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,358
- I don't know. He just seems scared to death.
- Is he ill?

202
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,400
No, he's just...

203
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,153
No, he's just trembling all over.

204
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,957
- Mr. Ambassador. Welcome, sir.
- Good morning.

205
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,753
- No!
- Damien!

206
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,078
- Damien!
- Damien, stop it!

207
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,513
Damien, stop it. Damien.

208
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,556
No!

209
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,871
Horton, drive on.

210
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,555
Are you sure that
you don't wanna call a doctor?

211
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,269
No, it's just a couple of bruises.
It'll be all right in the morning.

212
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,953
No, I mean... for Damien.

213
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:28,557
Oh, no, he's fine. He's... he's sound asleep.

214
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,632
Just... just to have him examine him.

215
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,352
Well, he's perfectly all right.
Never been sick a day in his life.

216
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,230
He never has, has he?
Isn't that a little strange?

217
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,676
Is it?

218
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,036
I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox.

219
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,351
- Not even a cough or a cold.
- So?

220
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,677
I just think it's a little unusual.

221
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,472
Look, he's a perfectly healthy boy.

222
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:07,990
I mean, we have nothing to worry about
with him. Not physically or... or otherwise.

223
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,028
He just... had a bad moment.

224
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,388
You know, like a fright.

225
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,035
Yes?

226
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:37,035
- I'm leavin' now. Is there anything else?
- Nothing, thank you. Good night.

227
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,788
I think the best thing to do with a bad day
like this is end it. I'm gonna go to bed.

228
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,189
I'll be along soon.

229
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,393
Quiet, now. This is the master of the house.

230
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,152
- What is this?
- Sir?

231
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,470
The dog.

232
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,634
- Beautiful, isn't he? We found him outside.
- Who gave you permission to bring it in?

233
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,958
I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir.
And Damien loves him.

234
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,794
Gave you a fright, did he, sir?

235
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,472
- Yes.
- Well, you see how good he is.

236
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,112
As a watchdog, I mean. I think you'll be
grateful on your long trips away, sir.

237
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,077
Mrs. Baylock, we don't need a dog...

238
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,992
...and if we do, I'll pick him out myself.

239
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,035
- Damien's taken quite a fancy to him, sir.
- Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA...

240
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,432
...tell them to collect the dog
and find him another home.

241
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,510
You understand?

242
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,750
Sir.

243
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,269
Come on, boy.

244
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,476
Welcome to Windsor Safari Park.

245
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,278
Animal compound to your left.

246
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,432
Parking, for refreshment and zoo area,
to your right.

247
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,390
When driving through animal compounds,
please keep all car windows closed.

248
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,711
Thank you.

249
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,310
Thank you.

250
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,954
Come on, darling.
Let's go see the monkeys, OK?

251
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,151
- Good morning, Horton.
- Good morning, sir.

252
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,552
Baboons bite. Keep all car windows closed.

253
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,234
Keep all car windows closed.

254
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,548
Baboons are dangerous.

255
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,073
Oh, no!

256
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,951
- All right, Kathy?
- Yeah.

257
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,272
You're so... silent this evening.

258
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,473
Just tired, I guess. Sorry.

259
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,231
- Damien all right?
- Yeah.

260
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,310
- You sure?
- Yes.

261
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:54,515
If there were anything wrong,
you'd... tell me, wouldn't you?

262
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:00,755
Wrong? What could be wrong with our child,
Robert? We're beautiful people, aren't we?

263
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,876
There is something wrong, isn't there?

264
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,795
Kathy.

265
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,871
Is it so serious?

266
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,353
Robert, I... I want...

267
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,036
I need to see a psychiatrist. I... I have... fears.

268
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,349
I have such fears.

269
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,512
What kind of fears? What kind?

270
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,273
If I told you, you'd put me away.

271
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,034
Kathy, I love you. I love you.

272
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,918
Then help me. Find me a doctor.

273
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,594
I will. Of course I will.

274
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,911
Keep that scrum tight!
Get down low! Come on!

275
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,436
Let it go! Let it go!

276
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,554
Bring him down!

277
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,630
Well done!

278
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,836
I don't know what you're clapping for.
You just lost a bet.

279
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,878
- That's right. 27-3?
- Right. That'll be three quid.

280
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,588
- I thought it was two.
- Inflation. Haven't you heard, old boy?

281
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,829
Well done, George. Great stuff.

282
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,275
It was a good game.

283
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,396
Go and have a quick drink with the lads.

284
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,835
That'll give me time
to make sure everything's set up.

285
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,835
Tomorrow, half past two, Bishop's Park.
Five minutes and you'll never see me again.

286
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,628
Your wife is in danger.
She'll die unless you come.

287
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,271
Father!

288
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,070
Thanks again.

289
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,952
Get on with it. Say what you have to say.

290
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,235
"When the Jews return to Zion...

291
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,550
...and a comet rips the sky...

292
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:06,237
...and the Holy Roman Empire rises,
then you and I must die."

293
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,472
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore...

294
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:17,112
...turning man against his brother,
till man exists no more."

295
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,152
- The Book of Revelations predicted it all.
- I'm not here to listen to a sermon.

296
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,789
"It is by means of a human personality
entirely in his possession...

297
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,110
...that Satan will wage
his last and formidable offence."

298
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,635
- You said that my wife...
- Go to the town of Megiddo...

299
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,108
...in the old city of Jezreel.

300
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,753
There, see the old man Bugenhagen.

301
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,436
- He alone can say how the child must die.
- Look here...

302
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,909
"He who will not be saved by the lamb
will be torn by the beast!"

303
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,911
Will you stop?

304
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,550
I'm here because you said
my wife is in danger.

305
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,875
She is pregnant.

306
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,079
- You're mistaken. That's nonsense.
- He will not allow the child to be born.

307
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,994
- He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb.
- What are you talking about?

308
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,355
Your son, Mr. Thorn.

309
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,829
The son of the devil.

310
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,472
He will kill the unborn child,
then he will kill your wife...

311
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,833
...and when he is certain to inherit all that
is yours, then, Mr. Thorn, he will kill you.

312
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,954
That's enough!

313
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,510
With your power, he will establish
his counterfeit kingdom here...

314
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,273
...receiving his power directly from Satan!

315
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,237
- You're insane.
- He must die, Mr. Thorn!

316
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,550
You asked for five minutes,
and you've got five minutes.

317
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,190
Go to the city of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen before it's too late.

318
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,911
Now, I've heard you.

319
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,672
I want you to hear me.

320
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,672
I never want to see you again.

321
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,711
You'll see me in hell, Mr. Thorn.

322
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:06,556
There will we share out our sentence.

323
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,514
No!

324
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,231
Mrs. Baylock!

325
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:11,987
- Anything wrong?
- I just can't stand that noise.

326
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,833
It's not all that bad.

327
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,480
- Good morning, Damien.
- Good morning, Daddy.

328
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:20,914
- What are we gonna do?
- Hold my hands.

329
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,115
- Right.
- Mrs. Baylock!

330
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,190
Yes, ma'am?

331
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,916
- Would you take him out of here, please?
- He's only playing.

332
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,753
Would you just get him out of here, please?

333
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,871
Yes, ma'am.

334
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,353
Come along, Damien. Excuse me, sir.

335
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,311
Come along.

336
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,590
Darling, I don't know
what's the matter with me. I just...

337
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:05,592
I just don't seem to be able to...

338
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,068
I don't know.

339
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,751
Kathy, I love you.

340
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,989
If this is what the doctor's doing to you...

341
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,389
...don't you think it's time
I had a talk with him?

342
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,471
Yes, you should.

343
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,271
There's something
he wants to talk to you about, anyway.

344
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,351
Oh?

345
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,233
Robert, I... I don't ever
want to have any more children.

346
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:52,030
All right.

347
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,313
Then you'll agree to an abortion?

348
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,875
I'm pregnant, Robert.
I just found out this morning.

349
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,795
Yes?

350
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,916
Yes, this is he.

351
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,637
Who?

352
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:32,710
Who? But...

353
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,199
Hello?

354
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,791
Hello?

355
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,632
Something about the newspapers.

356
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,559
Well, she knew how much you wanted one.

357
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:08,192
Now she can't cope. She searches for reasons
that won't make her feel inadequate.

358
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,793
She has these fantasies.

359
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,398
She fantasizes that your child is alien
and that your child is evil.

360
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,074
She thinks that the child is evil?

361
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:23,438
The point is, at this time,
another child would be disastrous.

362
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,155
Well, in what way... evil?

363
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,791
Now, this is just fantasy.
She also thinks the child isn't hers.

364
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,630
The most important thing for you to do
is to agree to an abortion.

365
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:52,710
No!

366
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,954
I'd like to know your reason.

367
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:06,436
It was foretold that
this pregnancy would be terminated.

368
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,512
I'm going to fight to see that it's not.

369
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,875
- Forgive me, Doctor.
- Please don't leave.

370
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,349
I'm sorry. I must get home.

371
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:58,476
Oh!

372
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,117
Damien! Damien!

373
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,708
No, no, no, no!

374
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,672
No! No!

375
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,311
Aagh!

376
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:53,349
Are there any developments
on the state of your wife, sir?

377
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,717
- How is your wife, Mr. Ambassador?
- Is there any news, sir?

378
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,471
- Ambassador Thorn?
- Yes. Doctor?

379
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:07,755
My name is... Becker.

380
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,478
Is she... all right?

381
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,789
Well, she will recover.

382
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,838
She's in there. Bed by the window.

383
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,351
She has a concussion
and a broken humerus...

384
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,556
...and... well, some internal bleeding.

385
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:34,233
- Internal bleeding?
- Yes.

386
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,628
But she's pregnant.

387
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,152
No.

388
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,237
- She's lost it?
- Afraid so.

389
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,918
You know, you've got a lot to be grateful for.
She's still alive.

390
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,913
And, with proper care,
she can still have children.

391
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:50,110
Robert.

392
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,431
- Robert.
- Shh.

393
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,914
Don't let him kill me.

394
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:07,193
Don't let him kill me.

395
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:14,918
Kathy.

396
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,271
Kathy.

397
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,590
Kathy.

398
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,590
Kathy.

399
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:34,510
It's all right.

400
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:37,630
Kathy.

401
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,277
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you, Ambassador Thorn.

402
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,715
- Who is this?
- My name is Keith Jennings, sir.

403
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,030
The photographer
whose camera got smashed.

404
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,793
Would it be possible
to have a word with you at my flat?

405
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,510
- If it's about the camera...
- No, it's not about the camera.

406
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:43,398
It's about you, Mr. Thorn.

407
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,152
- And the death of the priest.
- Oh?

408
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,719
Go on.

409
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,675
Do you notice anything unusual?

410
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,552
No. Sorry.

411
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,268
At first I thought
this was just a fault in the film.

412
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,869
A strange coincidence.

413
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:22,313
Then it happened again.

414
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:25,833
Interesting, don't you think?

415
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,512
And this... I took on the day
that you were at the rugby match.

416
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,034
- Same thing?
- Only it's more pronounced...

417
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:37,635
...and it's actually
making contact with the body.

418
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,311
The rest, of course - history.

419
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,391
I can't explain it.

420
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:55,307
That's why I started digging. The coroner's
report shows that he was riddled with cancer.

421
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,438
High on morphine most of the time.
Injected himself two or three times a day.

422
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,956
- He knew that he was dying?
- Apparently, yes.

423
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,675
He said that he wanted
to be forgiven by Christ.

424
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:16,389
Externally, his body was normal, except for
one thing on the inside of his right thigh.

425
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,199
- What is it?
- Three sixes.

426
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,556
Six hundred and sixty-six.

427
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,155
- Concentration camp?
- That's what I thought.

428
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:34,315
But the biopsy says it's a birthmark.
The best is yet to come.

429
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,153
Pages of the Bible. Thousands of 'em.

430
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:51,027
Every inch of wall-space covered,
even the windows.

431
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:57,077
He even needed to be close to his church.

432
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,949
There are 47. I counted them.

433
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,996
I think he was trying
to keep something out, don't you?

434
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,436
The police thought he was insane. They let
me come here to see if I could find anything.

435
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:23,027
The first item... is a diary.

436
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,596
It didn't say anything about him.

437
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:32,195
It's about you. What time
you left the house, where you went...

438
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,751
...what restaurants you had your lunch in,
what time your speaking engagements were.

439
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,833
The last entry says that he was supposed to
have met you in Bishop's Park.

440
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,592
And that was dated the day he died.

441
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,349
The important items are here. If we're to get
to the bottom of this, we've got to start here.

442
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:59,114
This first clipping
is from the Astrologer's Monthly.

443
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:04,956
Reports an unusual phenomenon. A comet
changed its shape into a glowing star...

444
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,634
...like the star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago.

445
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:12,998
This one was on the other side of the world,
the European continent, five years ago.

446
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,630
6 June, to be exact.

447
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:20,677
Does that date mean anything to you?

448
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,590
Yes.

449
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:25,876
Then you'll recollect this other clipping.

450
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,793
It's a birth announcement
from a Rome newspaper.

451
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,155
Also dated 6 June, five years ago.

452
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:35,708
The day your son was born.

453
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,711
The sixth month, sixth day.

454
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,034
Was your son born at 6am?

455
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,913
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out
this birthmark. The three sixes.

456
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:56,835
My son is... dead.

457
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,231
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

458
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,998
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to help you try and find out.

459
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,469
No. It's my problem.

460
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,635
No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too.

461
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,476
When I came here with the police,
I took some photographs.

462
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:31,996
I happened to catch sight
of my own reflection in that mirror.

463
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,072
I know you must think I'm crazy,
but I'm so frightened.

464
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:55,313
Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here.
You'll be perfectly all right.

465
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,114
Ow.

466
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:02,190
Some all right

467
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:06,469
- What about Damien?
- I'll speak to Mrs. Horton.

468
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,153
She'll look after him.

469
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,510
Mrs. Horton?

470
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,110
Mrs. Horton?

471
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:22,949
- Mrs. Baylock.
- Sir.

472
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,634
- Where's Mrs. Horton?
- Gone.

473
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:29,989
- Gone out?
- No, they've gone. They just got up and went.

474
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,311
They left an address for you
to send their last month's wages to.

475
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,996
Well, didn't... Mrs. Horton say anything?
Didn't Horton leave any explanation?

476
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,117
No. But don't worry, sir. I can manage.

477
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:56,391
- I'll look into this when I get back.
- Just as you wish, sir.

478
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,596
- Oh, and Mrs. Baylock?
- Sir?

479
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:02,275
Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room.
I clearly told you...

480
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,148
He's gone now, sir.
They took him away this morning.

481
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,157
- Non č questo.
- Ospedale dei Cappuccini.

482
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:41,356
- Non č questo.
- Sě! Ospedale dei Cappuccini.

483
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,393
No.

484
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,916
lo ricordo la vecchia, in mattone.

485
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,597
This is the right address.

486
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,318
Ci fu un incendio anni fa.

487
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,157
- Ma cosa č successo?
- Ci fu un terribile incendio.

488
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,516
- Il vecchio ospedale fu distrutto.
- There was a terrible fire...

489
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,230
...and the old hospital burned down.
- Č stato cinque anni fa.

490
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,594
Five years ago.

491
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,034
- Aspetta, per favore.
- OK.

492
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,277
But surely the fire didn't destroy everything.
There must have been some records.

493
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:37,070
Mi dispiace.
I sorry. I think everything was destroyed.

494
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:40,197
Isn't it possible
there were some papers stored elsewhere?

495
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,474
- I do not know.
- Sister.

496
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,228
This is most important to me.

497
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,789
I adopted a child here.
I'm searching for some records of it...

498
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,791
- There were no adoptions here.
- There was one.

499
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,713
- No, signore.
- It wasn't an actual adoption.

500
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,313
- You are mistake.
- Wait.

501
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,030
Birth records.
If I gave you a date. An exact date.

502
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,873
It's no use. The fire started
in the hall of records in the basement.

503
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,757
All the paperwork was there.
Went up like a torch.

504
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,956
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.

505
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,715
- The third floor?
- The maternity wards. Nothing left but ashes.

506
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,155
- You will excuse me?
- What about the staff?

507
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:22,800
- Surely some survived.
- Sě, some.

508
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,713
There was a tall man, a priest.

509
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,472
Dark eyes. Piercing eyes.

510
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,914
Sě. Padre Spiletto.

511
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,954
Yes.

512
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:35,032
- He was principale.
- Yes, he was in charge. Is he...

513
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,190
- Yes, he is alive.
- Is he here?

514
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,429
- No.
- Where?

515
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:42,195
He's in a monastero in... Frosinone.

516
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,594
Many were taken there. Many die.

517
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:50,228
Perhaps he is die since,
but he lived through the fire.

518
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,398
I remember people say it was un miracolo.

519
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:58,795
- Frosinone?
- Sě. Il monastero di San Domenico.

520
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,347
- Mille grazie, signora.
- Prego.

521
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,592
- Here we are.
- What is it?

522
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:29,478
- "When the Jews return to Zion..."
- That's the poem.

523
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:32,027
"When the Jews return to Zion..."

524
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:35,077
And there was something about a comet.

525
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:39,233
Yes, that's here too. "The shower of stars
and the rise of the Roman Empire."

526
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:43,597
These are supposed to be the events
that signal the birth of the Antichrist.

527
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,670
The devil's child.

528
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:56,396
It's making more sense. The Jews have
returned to Zion and there has been a comet.

529
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,630
As for the rise of the Roman Empire...

530
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,952
...scholars think that could well mean
the Common Market, the Treaty of Rome.

531
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,588
- Bit of a stretch.
- What about this? In Revelations it says:

532
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:10,514
- "He shall rise from the eternal sea."
- That's the poem again.

533
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:14,309
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore."

534
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,710
- That was the beginning of it.
- Theologians have interpreted...

535
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,190
...the "eternal sea"
as meaning the world of politics...

536
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,557
...the sea that constantly rages
with turmoil and revolution.

537
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:31,190
So the devil's child will rise
from the world of politics.

538
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,114
Looks like this is as far as we go.

539
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:56,190
Let's have a look.

540
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,871
Found him?

541
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,516
His mind is active,
but since the fire he's not made a sound.

542
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:47,034
We feed him and take care of his needs.

543
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,510
And we pray for his recovery
when his penance is completed.

544
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,032
What penance?

545
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:54,918
"Woe to the shepherd
who abandons his sheep."

546
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,992
"May his right arm wither
and his right eye lose its sight."

547
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,833
He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why?

548
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,911
For abandoning Christ.

549
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,036
- How do you know he's abandoned Christ?
- He told us.

550
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:09,998
- But he doesn't speak.
- There is some movement in his left hand.

551
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,673
He was able to write it down.

552
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,432
You will notice the curved line over the head.

553
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,399
This indicates the hood of the monk.
His own hood.

554
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,596
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign of the devil.

555
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,150
- But why three of them?
- We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity.

556
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:36,837
- The devil, Antichrist and false prophet.
- Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

557
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,756
For everything holy, there is something
unholy. This is the essence of temptation.

558
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:51,470
Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn.

559
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:58,033
There was a child.
I want to know where that child came from.

560
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:02,351
- I am afraid that...
- You confessed to them. Now confess to me.

561
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:05,158
- What happened?
- Please, signore.

562
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:08,630
You said you knew its mother.
Where is she now?

563
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:13,635
- I must insist that you do not...
- I beg you... where is she?

564
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,069
Answer me!

565
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,507
Answer!

566
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:32,110
Excuse me.

567
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,310
Cervet.

568
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,231
Please... does it mean something to you?

569
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,989
Cerveteri.

570
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:37,957
It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times.

571
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:40,679
Cripta Sant'Angelo.

572
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,037
- It is nothing but ruins.
- Where is this place?

573
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,590
- But there is nothing there. Only graves.
- Where is it?

574
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,628
You will find it on the map.
It is perhaps 50km north of Rome.

575
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,911
Robert, over here!

576
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:14,913
Maria... Scianna.

577
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,990
My God.

578
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,913
June 6.

579
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:25,110
Five years ago.

580
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,347
Bambino Scianna.

581
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:31,828
Infant boy. Same date.

582
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,679
 "Mortuum et natum
saecula completunt."

583
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,471
"In birth and death,
the generations embrace."

584
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:50,070
Is my son...

585
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,951
...buried here?

586
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,639
This woman could be
the mother of the child you adopted.

587
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:03,431
Why here in this terrible place?

588
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,474
- No.
- Oh, my God.

589
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,310
- The other one.
- No. Let's get out of here.

590
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,109
If it's an animal too...

591
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:51,555
...then maybe my child...

592
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,434
...is alive somewhere.

593
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:10,310
They murdered him.

594
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,789
They murdered him as soon as he was born.

595
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:19,470
Murderers.

596
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,238
Murderers.

597
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:36,350
Come on.

598
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,149
Robert.

599
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,996
Don't run. It's only the smell of the graves.

600
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,430
Run!

601
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,158
Robert!

602
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,909
Aagh! Aagh!

603
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,676
- Hello?
- Hello.

604
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,751
Kathy?

605
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,515
Hello, Robert. Is that you?
Oh, I'm so glad you called.

606
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,878
Kathy, darling.
Now, listen to me... very carefully.

607
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,029
Do just what I say.

608
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:34,350
I want you to leave London right now.

609
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,435
- What do you mean, leave London, darling?
- I've put through a call to the embassy.

610
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,514
Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital
and bring you here to Rome.

611
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,274
- Robert, what's happened? What's wrong?
- Please, darling. Just do it.

612
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:50,748
Get ready to leave.

613
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,836
- Robert, I don't think I can move very well.
- Kathy, do it.

614
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:02,239
OK. Yes, all right, I'll...
I'll try to be ready by the time he gets here.

615
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:04,310
All right, darling.

616
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,559
Who is that? Is that somebody there?

617
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,029
Tom? Is that you?

618
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:41,390
Yes?

619
01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:44,190
Yes, this is he.

620
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:49,470
Tom?

621
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,831
Kathy?

622
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,591
Tom...

623
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,837
...I can't... talk now.

624
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,230
Robert.

625
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,912
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

626
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,157
It's derived from the word "Armageddon".

627
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,637
The end of the world.

628
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,552
It's underground,
about 60 miles south of Jerusalem.

629
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,756
There's some excavation going on there.

630
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:31,914
If only you could remember the name
of the man you're supposed to see.

631
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,990
It's Bugenhagen.

632
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,479
He was an exorcist. I read about him.

633
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:41,908
That was his name.
And I remember the poem.

634
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,319
"When the Jews return to Zion...

635
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:48,038
...and a comet fills the sky...

636
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:51,475
...and the Holy Roman Empire rises...

637
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,948
...then you and I must die."

638
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:59,551
"From the eternal sea he rises...

639
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,518
...creating armies on either shore...

640
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:06,516
...turning man against his brother...

641
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:11,748
...till man exists no more."

642
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,069
Kathy is dead.

643
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:25,033
I want Damien to die, too.

644
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:20,668
Hello, Mr. Thorn.

645
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,149
I am Bugenhagen.

646
01:25:23,239 --> 01:25:27,028
- What is this place?
- The city of Jezreel.

647
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:30,788
Town of Megiddo.

648
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,835
The place...

649
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,309
...where Christianity began.

650
01:25:38,359 --> 01:25:41,875
The little priest - is he dead yet?

651
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,476
Yes.

652
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:49,110
Yes.

653
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:56,514
Come along, Mr. Thorn.
We had better get to work.

654
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,349
You will excuse us.

655
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:12,037
This is for Mr. Thorn alone.

656
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,831
All right.

657
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,435
It must be done on hallowed ground.

658
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:15,635
A church.

659
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:19,189
His blood must be spilled on the altar of God.

660
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,472
This first knife is most important.

661
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:34,630
It extinguishes physical life
and forms the centre of the cross.

662
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:41,354
The subsequent placings
extinguish spiritual life...

663
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:44,671
...and should radiate outward.

664
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,751
Like this.

665
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:55,356
This is not a human child. Make no mistake.

666
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:06,953
- Is there proof?
- Oh, yes.

667
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,314
He bears a birthmark.

668
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,908
A sequence of sixes.

669
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:17,756
So, says the Bible,
do all the apostles of Satan.

670
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:22,676
- He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

671
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,552
I've bathed him. I know every inch of him.

672
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:33,238
If it is not visible on the body,
it will be beneath the hair.

673
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,560
Remove it.

674
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,117
You must be devoid of pity.

675
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:48,509
- And the woman?
- She is an apostate of hell.

676
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,716
She will die before permitting this.

677
01:28:59,479 --> 01:29:05,190
Look, I want to know what he said.
I've a right to know.

678
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:09,831
Robert, I want to know what he said!
Look, I'm not just some bystander.

679
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,798
- I was the one that found him!
- I'm the one that's supposed to kill him.

680
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,634
These are knives. He wants me to stab him.

681
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,712
- Wants me to murder a child.
- It's not a child!

682
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,472
How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong.

683
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:28,554
It's insane. I won't have anything
to do with murdering a little boy!

684
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,472
He's not responsible. I won't do it.

685
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:42,078
Well, if you don't do it, I will.

686
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,908
No!

687
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,199
Run, Damien! Run! Run!

688
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,551
No!

689
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,555
Hold it.

690
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,631
Hey!

691
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,753

- No, Daddy! No!
- God help me.

703
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:07,436
Police! Drop! Drop, or I'll fire!

704
01:42:19,159 --> 01:42:25,599
And so to their final rest do we commit
these two and entrust them unto our Lord.

Ready, aim, fire!

710
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,189
Ready, aim, fire!

711
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:50,871
Excuse me, Mr. President. When you're ready
to leave, your car is over there.

712
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,154
- In a moment.
- Yes, sir.
