You're under no obligation
to say anything at this point in time

can be used as evidence

OK, now, picking up where we left off
when we last spoke,

932
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:20,858
you were telling us
how upset your uncles were

Can you remember what was said
or any...any comments that were made

935
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:29,014
at that time exactly?

936
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:39,298
Josh, has Mr White
provided you with advice

937
01:00:39,298 --> 01:00:41,697
in respect to how you should conduct
yourself in this interview today?

Yes, he'll be remaining mute.

939

OK, I can appreciate you've been
advised not to say anything to me,

940
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:49,739
but the sooner you help us
with our inquiries,

941
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:52,697
the sooner we can scratch you off
the list and move onto a different line.

at this point?

feeling in the room.

the right thing

his foot's covered in dog shit

right in his mouth.

anywhere near to you, to be honest.

Can he handle police?

if there's some strings I can pull,

is to decide how best to proceed,

given the brave offer
of assistance he's made.

01:31:59,859 --> 01:32:03,180
You know, this thing's going to trial
with or without J, that's a given.

What we want is to win it.

01:32:08,341 --> 01:32:10,420
You know what I liked
about the committal hearing?

01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:13,301
Despite the fact that we've been
ordered to stand trial, of course.

1361
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:17,421
But what I liked about the committal
was that for the most part,

1362
01:32:17,421 --> 01:32:19,779
their case looked
pretty flimsy to me.

1363
01:32:19,779 --> 01:32:21,380
Largely dependent
on witness testimony

1364
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:24,619
that shouldn't be too hard to
discredit, I wouldn't have thought.

1365
01:32:24,619 --> 01:32:27,819
And if the committals any indicator,
then J here's their star witness.

1366
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:31,539
Without him, they'll need
to strengthen their brief,

1367
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:33,895
which they will do
with something else.

1368
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:38,220
Personally, Id rather tackle
the evidence I saw at the committal

1369
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,701
than any rejigged brief
they come up with

- Hiding.

who raided the house today.

OK? They'd been told
something funny was going on here.

on this night

1426

the relationship.
