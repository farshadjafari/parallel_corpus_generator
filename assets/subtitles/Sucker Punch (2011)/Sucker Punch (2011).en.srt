1
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,270
Everyone has an angel.

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,936
A guardian who watches over us.

3
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,565
We can't know what form they'll take.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,447
One day, old man.

5
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,697
Next day, little girl.

6
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,038
But don't let appearances fool you.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,329
They can be as fierce as any dragon.

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,625
Yet they're not here
to fight our battles...

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,837
...but to whisper from our heart...

10
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,377
...reminding that it's us.

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:48,800
It's every one of us who holds
the power over the worlds we create.

12
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,370
No!

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,496
No.

14
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:08,016
SUCKER PUNCH

15
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,568
We can deny our angels exist...

16
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,609
...convince ourselves
they can't be real.

17
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,741
But they show up anyway.

18
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,997
At strange places.

19
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,578
And at strange times.

20
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,583
They can speak through any character
we can imagine.

21
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,373
They'll shout through demons
if they have to...

22
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,758
...daring us...

23
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,215
...challenging us to Fight.

24
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,647
Female. Age 20.

25
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,810
-You're the father?
-Stepfather.

26
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,647
That's right. We talked on the phone.

27
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,326
Okay, come with me.

28
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,507
We're gonna take her into the theater.

29
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,425
Dr. Gorski's gonna want to take a look
at her.

30
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,873
She likes to see all the new girls.

31
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,087
Don't worry, Dad.
Everything's gonna be fine.

32
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,219
I've got everything under control
around here.

33
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,051
Okay? Come on. Follow me.

34
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,239
So this is what we call the theater.

35
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,163
Liar!

36
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,128
Oh, girls. Yes, go, go.

37
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,963
Hey. Come here.

38
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,969
Girls. Behave.

39
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,506
-Break it up. Break it up.
-Will you stop them?

40
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,594
Lynn.

41
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,473
Amy.

42
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,103
Sit down.

43
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,309
Sit.

44
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,653
Anyway. So the girls use this place
to be social.

45
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:44,237
Dr. Gorski, she uses it to help them
deal with their issues.

46
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,702
Polish therapy.

47
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,700
It's quite a show, watching them
act out who touched them or beat them.

48
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,789
Dr. Gorski seems to think it helps.
I'm not so sure.

49
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:58,296
But whether it does or doesn't
won't matter much to you.

50
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,049
Once we take care of
a little bit of business...

51
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,418
...there won't be any of that
for this one.

52
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,756
-Good.
-She'll be in paradise,

53
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,468
if you know what I mean.

54
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,137
And all of your troubles will be over.

55
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,525
Now, I know we said 1400 on the phone...

56
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,687
I'm taking a really big risk here...

57
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,482
...so it's gonna have
to be 2 grand even.

58
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,322
What the hell are you talking about?
We had a deal.

59
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:33,491
Listen, Father,
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

60
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,034
Clearly you're a man that can take
care of himself.

61
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,752
I don't know what you did to this girl.
And, frankly, I don't wanna know.

62
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,009
What are you gonna tell the detectives
when they come around?

63
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,340
They're gonna love her side
of the story.

64
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,925
-Yeah.
-Okay.

65
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,928
I'm going to start your music.

66
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,226
You are safe.

67
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,102
It's all safe.

68
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,227
Now relax.

69
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,853
And just let go.

70
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,738
Now, here's the other thing:

71
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,775
I don't have a doctor on staff
who does lobotomies.

72
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,364
-What?
-But...

73
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,031
...there happens to be one scheduled
to come in in five days.

74
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,121
So I'll just forge her signature.
I've done it a dozen times.

75
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,785
It's like we talk about.

76
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,209
You control this world.

77
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,049
I told the police she lost her mind
when her mother died.

78
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,381
The truth is a little more complicated.

79
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,717
Let the pain go.

80
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,470
Let the hurt go.

81
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,802
Let the guilt go.

82
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,189
What you're imagining right now...

83
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,941
...that world you control?

84
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,194
That place can be as real as any pain.

85
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,355
I don't want her to remember a thing.

86
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,794
Don't worry,

87
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,162
she won't even remember her name
when I'm done with her.

88
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,829
Stop.

89
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,549
Get that thing away from me.

90
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,754
Get it away from me.

91
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,798
Where is my mind?

92
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,305
And shut off that damn music.

93
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,925
Undo these straps.

94
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,936
Don't forget my ankles.

95
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,019
Hurry.

96
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,977
Is there a problem, Sweet Pea?

97
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,821
This is a joke, right?

98
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,446
Don't you get the point of this?

99
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,361
It's to turn people on.

100
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,073
I get the sexy little schoolgirl.

101
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,960
I even get the helpless mental patient,
right? That can be hot.

102
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,711
But what is this?

103
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,796
Lobotomized vegetable?

104
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,298
How about something a little more
commercial, for God's sakes?

105
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,760
Sweet Pea,
could you come here, please?

106
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,977
You gotta help me.

107
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,688
I'm the star of the show, remember?

108
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,979
I'll figure something out.

109
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,775
All right, ladies. Wrap it up.

110
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,691
Sweet Pea, I want you
to meet somebody. This--

111
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,950
Don't tell me.

112
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,576
The priest brought you here from the
orphanage to lose your virginity, right?

113
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,868
Oh, let me rephrase that.

114
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,081
To sell it.

115
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,245
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, that's right.

116
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,585
How original.

117
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,292
The High Roller is coming for her
in five days.

118
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,963
He's gonna, you know,
just do a little flower picking.

119
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,344
And he's gonna pay
a lot of money for that.

120
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,883
Mm. Luck you.

121
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,104
Can you do me a favor, honey?

122
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,123
Can you show this
little baby doll around,

123
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,172
give her a tour
of the establishment, please?

124
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:12,777
Blue, you saw the show, okay?
I don't have the time.

125
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,441
Let my sister take her.

126
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,107
Rocket.

127
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,123
Show her around, will you, sis?

128
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,871
All right, come on. Let's go.

129
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,999
Don't worry, I don't bite very hard.

130
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,134
Goodbye, my dear.

131
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,553
-Jesus!
-Oh...

132
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,339
You'll get what you deserve
when the High Roller comes!

133
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,224
-Calm down.
-I will not calm down.

134
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,057
-You see what she did? I hope you rot!
-I did. I'm sorry.

135
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,891
This way.

136
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,647
You're gonna be okay. It just
takes a little while to get used to.

137
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,189
So how'd you become an orphan?

138
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,825
Oh, I get it. It's complicated, right?

139
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,032
Well, we all have our stories in here.
Mine's...

140
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,287
...complicated

141
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,667
These are the rooms
where we take the clients.

142
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,672
There's fresh towels
in all the bathrooms and--

143
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,044
Turn that on.

144
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,261
Blue owns the club.

145
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,268
And we, my dear, heh...

146
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,565
...are the main attractions. Ta-da.

147
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,475
The club's a front for his business.

148
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,192
Guns, gambling, medications,
special favors.

149
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,486
He brings in his clients,
and we gotta make them feel, you know...

150
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,244
...special.

151
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,862
New girl.

152
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,408
This is our backstage.

153
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,751
It's just for us, so don't
bring any clients back here, okay?

154
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,214
Or Blue's gonna get pissed.

155
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,918
Uh, cleaning closet.

156
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:04,464
You'll find all the
mops, brooms, disinfectants.

157
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,383
New girls get cleaning duties.

158
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,641
I don't make the rules.

159
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,808
And if you don't do what you're told,
Blue locks us in here...

160
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,727
...until we become
a bit more cooperative.

161
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,322
Don't worry.
It's not gonna happen to you.

162
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,240
This is the kitchen.

163
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,537
We all work in here.

164
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,623
Time for rehearsal.

165
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,083
-She looked nice.
-She looked stuck-up to me.

166
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,092
No. She's scared.

167
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,643
I feel sorry for her.

168
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,722
Amber, you feel sorry for everyone.

169
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Do you remember when you first got here?
Nobody felt sorry for you.

170
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,554
Well, don't get
too attached to her, okay?

171
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,438
Blue's saving her for the High Roller.

172
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,604
She's no virgin.

173
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,777
Babydoll, that's Amber, Blondie,
and you've met my sister, Sweet Pea.

174
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,193
-Watch yourself.
-Come on, just give her a break.

175
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,532
Yeah, she hasn't done anything
to you guys.

176
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,321
You best friends now?

177
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,741
Will you just let me finish my tour,
please?

178
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,544
Thank you.

179
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,790
Everybody gets a dance, a routine.

180
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,507
We practice, practice, practice,
and the men come and watch us perform.

181
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,673
And if they like what they see...

182
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,394
Well, you'll see tonight.

183
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,224
Good evening, gentlemen.

184
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,190
We've got a great night
in store for you.

185
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,817
I see a lot of new faces out there.

186
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,823
As well as some familiar ones.

187
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,734
So I'm not gonna yammer on too long.

188
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,450
I want you all to sit back,
enjoy the service...

189
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,410
...the scenery.

190
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,667
But most of all, enjoy the show.

191
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,665
Hit it.

192
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,926
Ooh. Au right.

193
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,727
It ain't no big thing

194
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,895
To wait for the bell to ring

195
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,103
It ain't no big thing

196
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,573
The toll of the bell

197
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,113
Aggravated, spare for days

198
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,783
I troll downtown.
The red light place

199
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,745
Jump up, bubble up
What's in store

200
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,837
Love is the drug
And I need to score

201
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,386
Showing out, showing out,
Hit and run

202
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,215
Boy meets girl
Well, the beat goes on

203
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,227
Stitched up tight
I can't shake free

204
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,431
Because love is the drug for me

205
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,188
Oh

206
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:09,233
Love is the drug

207
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,077
Late that night I park my car

208
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:17,286
Stake my place in the singles bar

209
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,210
Face to face,
Toe to toe

210
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,964
Heart to heart as we hit the floor

211
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,756
Lumber up, limbo down

212
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,885
The locked embrace, the stumble round

213
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,799
I say go

214
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,558
And I say yes

215
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,430
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

216
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,275
Oh

217
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,104
Love is the drug

218
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,691
Oh

219
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,866
Love is the drug

220
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,407
Oh

221
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:05,289
Love is
Love is the drug

222
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,507
Love is the drug for me

223
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,578
Oh, catch that buzz

224
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,336
Because love is the drug
I'm thinking of

225
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,793
Oh

226
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,050
Can't you see
Love is the drug

227
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,753
Got a hook in me

228
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,318
Oh, catch that buzz

229
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,987
Because love is the drug
that I'm thinking of

230
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:08,648
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me

231
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,446
Ain't no big thing
Yeah, no big thing

232
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,034
Whoo!

233
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:23,120
Can't you see
Love is the drug for me

234
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,712
Oh

235
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,374
Love is the drug

236
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,511
Oh

237
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,261
Love is, love is

238
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:45,722
Love is the drug

239
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,275
Drug, drug. The drug is love.

240
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,267
Give me that.

241
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,196
Somebody! Help me!

242
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,371
Shh.

243
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,719
Let her go, pig.

244
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,480
I didn't mean nothing.

245
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,391
Just having a little fun.

246
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,248
Are you okay?

247
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,330
Yeah. Let's just go.

248
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,251
We don't wanna be late.

249
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,590
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

250
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,928
Two, two, three, four,
arms, six, seven, eight. Stop.

251
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,388
Stop.

252
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,603
Where are you right now?

253
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,224
Are you with us or not?

254
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,109
Sweet Pea, take break.

255
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,062
Yeah.

256
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,912
Babydoll.

257
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,619
Come over here.

258
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,492
Come, come.

259
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,798
Let me look at you.

260
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,965
Hm.

261
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,805
You seem fit enough.

262
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,355
I'm going to play you some music, okay?

263
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,893
I want you to just relax.
Feel the music.

264
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,481
Open your heart to it. Let it in.

265
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,068
And when you are ready...

266
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,780
...I want you to dance.

267
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,606
If you do not dance,
you have no purpose.

268
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:47,820
And we don't keep things here
that have no purpose.

269
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:53,363
You see, your fight for survival
starts right now.

270
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,033
You don't want to be judged?
You won't be.

271
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,920
You don't think you're strong enough?
You are.

272
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,962
You're afraid. Don't be.

273
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,094
You have all the weapons you need.

274
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,595
Now fight.

275
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,177
Again.

276
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,416
Stand up

277
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:51,004
You've got to manage

278
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,240
Hello?

279
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,238
-Excuse me, could you help me? I'm--
-Shoes.

280
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,874
I'm sorry?

281
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,956
Your shoes.

282
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,955
You're tracking snow everywhere.

283
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,045
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I take them off?

284
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,801
That time has passed.

285
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,012
What can I do for you?

286
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,303
Nothing. I just--

287
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,059
Let me ask it another way:

288
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,762
What are you looking for?

289
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,522
A way out, I guess.

290
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,769
You guess?

291
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,359
No, I--

292
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,021
I know.

293
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,107
I need to get out of here.

294
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,276
Freedom.

295
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,864
That wasn't so hard, was it?

296
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,699
I'm going to help you to be free.

297
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,081
What do I have to do?

298
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,622
These are your weapons.

299
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,012
When you take them,
you begin your journey.

300
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,091
Your journey to freedom.

301
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,407
You will need five items
for this journey.

302
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,864
The first is a map.

303
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,951
Then fire, a knife and a key.

304
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,657
You said five things.

305
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,498
The fifth thing is a mystery.

306
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,123
It is the reason. It is the goal.

307
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:37,177
It will be a deep sacrifice
and a perfect victory.

308
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,677
Only you can find it.

309
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,929
And if you do...

310
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,770
...it will set you free.

311
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,731
Oh, and one more thing:

312
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,823
Defend yourself.

313
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,001
What was that?

314
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,963
Seriously, you're gonna have to
teach me how to dance like that.

315
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,502
That was crazy.

316
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,264
That was so amazing. I'm, like, shaking.

317
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,929
I've never seen Madame Gorski
clap like that before.

318
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,347
Well, get over it.

319
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,015
It's nearly lights out.

320
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,399
She's not easily impressed.

321
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,313
She wasn't impressed.
All that gyrating and moaning.

322
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,403
The dance should be
more than just titillation.

323
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,615
Mine's personal. It says who I am.

324
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,072
What the heck does yours say?

325
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,412
It says I'm gonna escape from here.

326
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,626
That I'm gonna be free.

327
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,838
Well, send me a postcard from paradise.

328
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,293
Are you really gonna try to escape?

329
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,637
Yeah. Before the High Roller comes.

330
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,969
-Can I come?
-Me too.

331
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,013
-Yeah, of course.
-You're not going anywhere, Rocket.

332
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,680
I'm gonna do what I wanna do.

333
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,226
No one's ever escaped from here.
You know that.

334
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,316
Yeah. You know, the last three girls
that tried died.

335
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,323
And the same thing'll happen
to the next fool.

336
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,483
Look, why don't you just
listen to my plan?

337
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,823
Don't wanna hear your plan, okay?

338
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,952
None of us do.

339
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,636
Now, let's get ready, girls.

340
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,518
Rehearsal in 15 minutes.

341
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,244
We're not helping Baby.

342
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,914
-Am I clear?
-What if it's a good plan?

343
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,833
Then she can go through with it.

344
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,344
I'm not letting you get hurt.

345
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,383
-I kept us safe through a lot of shit.
-I know you have.

346
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,056
I'm not gonna get hurt.

347
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,066
I just can't be here anymore.

348
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,352
And if it is a good plan,
we're both going.

349
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,737
No, we're not.

350
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,364
You're on your own.

351
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,669
-Well, I've been on my own before.
-Heh.

352
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,675
Sure you have.

353
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,720
Look where that got us.

354
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,851
Baby saved me from the Cook
the other day.

355
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,855
What?

356
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:20,530
I was working in the kitchen
and he comes in behind me.

357
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,538
And he pushes me down
and he gets on top of me...

358
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,869
...and I can't even move.

359
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,454
And there she was, just like that.

360
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,458
She had a knife to his throat.

361
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,256
She saved me.

362
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,286
The High Roller comes for me
in three days.

363
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,376
But I'm getting out of here
before he does.

364
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,463
So if you guys wanna come with me,
this is how I plan to do it.

365
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,133
Well?

366
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,673
Okay.

367
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,228
If we can collect all four
of these items, we can be free.

368
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,854
Okay.

369
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,515
-How do we use them?
-Wait up.

370
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,233
First things first.

371
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,815
How do you plan on
getting these things?

372
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,824
Well, whoever has the item we need,
we get them to watch me dance.

373
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,618
While we run around
and pick their pockets?

374
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,951
-Yeah, that's right.
-But we'd be taking all the risk.

375
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,957
We'd be doing the work
while you prance around with an alibi.

376
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,211
No. As long as I'm dancing,
they won't even know you're there.

377
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,914
Okay, so the first thing
we need is a map...

378
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,816
...to figure out
where all the exits are,

379
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:06,548
where the guards are located.

380
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:09,305
Blue has that in his office.
It's behind his desk.

381
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,764
Right. Good.

382
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,889
Second thing we need
is something to start a fire with...

383
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,399
...as a distraction for when we escape.

384
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,493
Plus, the fire should disable
all the checkpoints.

385
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,154
And the third thing is a knife...

386
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,653
...in case we run into trouble.

387
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,071
The Cook.

388
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,954
-We can do it.
-Okay.

389
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,165
And the last thing's a key.

390
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,034
Blue wears a key around his neck.

391
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,573
What door does it open?

392
00:41:36,716 --> 00:41:40,215
It's for all of them, I think.
It's a master key.

393
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:42,800
This plan is crazy.

394
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,757
There's armed guards everywhere, okay?

395
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,264
And if Blue finds out, we're dead.

396
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,468
It's not gonna be,
"Oh, sorry, Blue, we won't do it again."

397
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:52,985
Because we'll be dead.

398
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,809
We're already dead.

399
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,696
-I'm in.
-So am I.

400
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,527
Me too.

401
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,321
All right.

402
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,335
But I'm only doing this because you
guys'd get caught without me, okay?

403
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,086
And if it gets too hairy...

404
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,211
...if I say it's over...

405
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,091
...we stop.

406
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,797
Okay.

407
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,880
Okay.

408
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,933
I'll get the map.

409
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,105
I went for a walk
down the railroad track.

410
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,148
Next thing you know, some--

411
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,440
-What do you want?
-She's dancing.

412
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,199
Who is dancing?

413
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,535
Your baby doll.

414
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:44,373
One pill makes you larger

415
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,053
One pill makes you larger

416
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:55,683
And one pill makes you small

417
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,566
Baby.

418
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,785
Baby.

419
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,493
He's coming.
He's gonna start the briefing.

420
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,441
All right, here's the drill:

421
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,025
The Germans are preparing a report
for the kaiser. It's a map...

422
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,191
...that shows troop locations
and trench layouts.

423
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,735
Their field commander's
sending the map via courier...

424
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,825
...back to Germany on a zeppelin today.

425
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,451
How do we intercept it?

426
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:03,118
You're gonna cross no man's land,
enter the enemy trenches...

427
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,128
...and take the map from
the field commander's bunker...

428
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,460
...before the courier
can reach the zeppelin.

429
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,500
Sounds like fun.

430
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,795
Oh, and I've arranged something special
for Amber.

431
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,463
Give you some cover.

432
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,553
Get you out of there when you're done.

433
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,636
Let's go.

434
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,120
What do you think?

435
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,907
I like it.

436
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,722
German doctors and engineers...

437
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,184
...have worked out how to return
their fallen to the front lines.

438
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,772
They're using steam power and clockworks
to keep them moving.

439
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,531
So don't feel bad about killing them.

440
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,367
They're already dead.

441
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,828
Remember, ladies:

442
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,913
If you don't stand for something...

443
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,582
...you'll fall for anything.

444
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,260
Oh, and one last thing:

445
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,801
Try and work together.

446
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,998
Son of a--

447
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,779
Come on, guys. The bunker's this way.

448
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,090
-Cover!
-Rocket!

449
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,805
Sweet Pea! Help!

450
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,153
Unh. Sweet Pea!

451
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,638
Rocket.

452
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,981
Are you okay?

453
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,778
It's right here.

454
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,273
Rocket. That's enough.

455
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,600
Wow.

456
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,815
-Very good.
-Hm.

457
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,692
-Nice work.
-Thanks.

458
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,942
Very good.

459
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,319
Okay, this gives me an idea.

460
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,203
What about a private dance
for the Mayor.

461
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,408
What?

462
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,414
Nothing touchy-feely, just something
to get him wound up.

463
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,246
Get him ready to spend some money.

464
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,537
All she has to do
is do what she did just now.

465
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,967
That is out of the question.
She is not ready. It is too raw.

466
00:58:23,173 --> 00:58:24,564
Did you just say she's not ready?

467
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,150
She doesn't have a costume.
There is no set.

468
00:58:27,187 --> 00:58:30,592
Honey, she doesn't need that bullshit.
She's perfect.

469
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,126
Perhaps.

470
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:34,895
But that is not for you to decide,
that is for me to decide.

471
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,100
Oh.

472
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:41,394
It's my show, and I say she's not ready.

473
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:45,732
Clearly, I've offended you,
and I apologize.

474
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,399
Thank you.

475
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,034
Here's the thing:

476
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,445
This show might be yours...

477
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,991
...but the girls and you...

478
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,827
...are mine.

479
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,963
Right?

480
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,508
You're mine.

481
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,005
And if you need a stronger reminder
of that, you let me know, okay?

482
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,803
That won't be necessary.

483
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:17,142
So with or without your blessing,
she's gonna be on that stage tomorrow?

484
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,979
-I'll see what I can do.
-Attagirl.

485
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,314
-Mm-hm.
-All right.

486
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,026
You look fantastic, by the way.

487
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,324
Big show, girls.

488
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:35,993
Thank you.

489
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,534
-For what?
-The Cook.

490
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,043
-It was nothing.
-Shut up.

491
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,335
No one takes a risk for anyone in here.

492
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,921
So thank you.

493
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,131
You're welcome.

494
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,796
You got family?

495
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,512
No.

496
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,472
Oh, that's rig ht.

497
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,808
I forgot, you're an orphan.

498
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,189
I ran away from mine.

499
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,685
I thought I was pretty smart
at the time, but...

500
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,354
Sweet Pea followed.

501
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:12,694
Which is crazy, because she never even
had a real problem with Mom and Dad.

502
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,238
She just cares about you a lot.

503
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:22,415
Have you just ever wanted
to just take something back?

504
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,876
You know, something you said.

505
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,381
Something you did.

506
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,716
All the time.
