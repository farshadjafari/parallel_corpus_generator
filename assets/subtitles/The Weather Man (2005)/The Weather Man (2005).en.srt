1
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,843
<i>That was refreshing.</i>

2
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,771
<i>I'm refreshed.</i>

3
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,674
<i>I'm refreshing.</i>

4
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,799
Welcome back. I'm Bryant Gumbel.

5
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,635
- And I'm Anne Howard.
- Good stuff today.

6
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,301
<i>- We're going to be busy.</i>
<i>- We've got pop superstar Elton John.</i>

7
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,378
<i>He's going to be with us.</i>

8
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,413
<i>And so, too,</i>
<i>will best-selling author Al Franken.</i>

9
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,379
<i>Along with some</i>
<i>super-smart fourth graders...</i>

10
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,314
<i>with a great idea</i>
<i>for getting schoolbooks...</i>

11
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,715
<i>to kids who really need them.</i>

12
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,252
<i>But here's an idea</i>
<i>whose time has come.</i>

13
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,345
<i>Why don't we just start with...</i>

14
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,783
<i>... and fill the tart shell.</i>

15
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:12,490
<i>Bryant, you put some ice cream</i>
<i>on our angel food cake...</i>

16
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,500
<i>- How much do you want?</i>
<i>- As much as you like.</i>

17
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,713
<i>What are you laughing about?</i>
<i>This is Baked Alaska.</i>

18
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,292
<i>- This is supposed to be low-fat.</i>
<i>- It is!</i>

19
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,587
Did they call?

20
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,286
Someone from the show.
The Gumbel show. They didn't call?

21
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,695
Are you sure?

22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,802
- Once again, we're out of time.
- Thank you. Already?

23
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,634
We still got lots more ahead
this morning. We're going to be back...

24
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,797
- What's up, dude?
- Next person in line.

25
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,029
What's up?

26
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,438
- Hey, can I get your autograph?
- Next in line.

27
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,271
I'm not who you think I am, so...

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,438
You're not the weather guy?

29
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,845
Dan Spritz?

30
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,208
Dave Spritz.

31
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,378
I'm not Dave Spritz, no.
But I hear that a lot.

32
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,453
You don't have to be a dick.

33
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,295
Look, can you just...
All right, I'm just waiting in line.

34
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,869
Bro, I can read
your vehicle registration form.

35
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,173
So, whatever.

36
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,503
Can you...

37
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:10,539
All right, can you give me a break?
I just wanted to wait in line.

38
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,616
You're on TV, bro.

39
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,955
You're on TV.

40
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,251
- You're on TV, bro.
- So what? You keep saying that.

41
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,453
So you're on TV, bro.

42
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,859
Go work in a bank or something...

43
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,260
if you don't wanna be cool to people.

44
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,027
Whatever. Just...
Can you get out of my face?

45
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,868
Can you get out of my face?

46
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,508
- Asshole.
- You want to say that to my face?

47
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:41,071
I thought you wanted me
to get out of your face.

48
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,112
<i>People recognize me sometimes.</i>

49
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,042
<i>Some are dicks.</i>

50
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,657
This is the same system that created
those strong snowfalls in Minnesota.

51
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,226
It's meant some
slightly warmer weather...

52
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,420
<i>I should cool out a little, I guess.</i>

53
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,226
<i>I mean, I'm not just this</i>
<i>two-dimensional guy they recognize.</i>

54
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,699
<i>I do have a relationship to them.</i>

55
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,462
<i>I let them know</i>
<i>what they have to deal with.</i>

56
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,369
But listen, these warmer temperatures
are not going to last.

57
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,637
This wind system will keep pushing
colder air across the Midwest...

58
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,871
<i>I guess that's why</i>
<i>they think they know me.</i>

59
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,208
<i>But they don't, really.</i>

60
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,478
...our Spritz Nipper of the week
with a high of just 24.

61
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,186
<i>I'm not a hill of beans.</i>

62
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,679
<i>I have a plan.</i>

63
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,351
Okay, see you then.

64
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,719
- What's this afternoon?
- You're picking up Shelly.

65
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,318
- Where?
- Chicago Dance.

66
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,193
Then you're taking your dad
to Northwestern.

67
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,265
At 3:00?

68
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,900
Do you have that <i>Hello America</i> stuff?

69
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,469
- The letter?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,733
You have Mike, too.
5:30 at the Norris house.

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,807
Okay.

72
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,891
Do they have my cell phone?

73
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,053
Well, they should have
all the numbers in case.

74
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,126
And am I supposed to call
that guy Dersen?

75
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,928
Didn't he want me to call to touch base?

76
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,461
Okay.

77
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,964
- Dad, can we stop here?
- What for?

78
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,166
I need a notebook for school.

79
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,110
I'll just walk home.

80
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,874
Okay.

81
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,948
- Can I have some money?
- You don't have any?

82
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,081
No.

83
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
You're 12 years old.

84
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,762
You shouldn't be walking around
without money, okay, Shelly?

85
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,296
You're not a kid.

86
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,832
- How's your mom doing?
- She's good.

87
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,503
Can I have a pack of Lights?

88
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,908
- Regulars?
- The 100s.

89
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,306
Strikes?

90
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,608
How's Shelly?

91
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,216
She's doing great.

92
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,243
- Little angel.
- Yeah.

93
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,643
She's doing great.

94
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,620
- Who's an angel?
- Shelly.

95
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,723
Shelly is grossly overweight
and unhappy.

96
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,864
I'm concerned about her,
as I am Michael.

97
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,233
- David.
- Yeah, Dad.

98
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,026
Robert Spritzel?

99
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,269
Would you get me a paper...

100
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,394
- for the way back, Son?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,766
Fifteen minutes?

102
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,174
Yes. I'll see you then.

103
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,410
Fuck.

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,148
- Hey.
- Hey.

105
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,921
- It's getting cold.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,224
- What's the Nipper this week?
- Thursday.

107
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,355
Thursday's the Nipper? All right.

108
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,942
Here.

109
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,875
Yeah, can I get some change?

110
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,674
Not really.

111
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,577
Can I just get some quarters?
I just need a quarter for a paper.

112
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,017
Not really.

113
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,115
All right. I'll get something then.

114
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,118
All right.

115
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,498
Small coffee.

116
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,529
It's 80 cents.

117
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,360
No, it says $0.72.

118
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,505
After the whole everything, it's $0.80.

119
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,307
- Hey.
- Hi.

120
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,350
Where's the paper, David?

121
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,077
I didn't have enough money.

122
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,583
You bought a coffee.

123
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,848
- What?
- You bought a coffee.

124
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:59,223
Yeah, that, and then I didn't have
enough money after.

125
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,921
What?

126
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,699
I didn't have enough money
after I bought the coffee, so...

127
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,473
You should carry more than $1, David.

128
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,064
You're a grown man.

129
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,040
Let me just move this letter
from <i>Hello America.</i>

130
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,916
<i>My father is Robert King Spritzel.</i>

131
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,314
<i>He won the National Book Award</i>
<i>when he was 28.</i>

132
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,923
<i>And the Pulitzer when he was 33.</i>

133
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,656
<i>President Carter called him</i>
<i>a national treasure.</i>

134
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,232
<i>They played racquetball</i>
<i>in a regular game.</i>

135
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,994
<i>He was a great writer.</i>

136
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,131
<i>But what was the cost?</i>

137
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,806
<i>Did he neglect his family?</i>

138
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,273
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

139
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,604
<i>He was a fine father.</i>

140
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,873
<i>More than that, really.</i>

141
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,040
It's fruitless for Shelly to be dancing.

142
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,712
She should find another interest
that would be more rewarding to her...

143
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,283
that she can take more from, David.

144
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,757
- We've talked about that.
- Well, you should do something, Son.

145
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,159
We've tried a couple things.
We'll keep trying, so...

146
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,291
How's Michael?

147
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,061
I think that was an overreaction
on Noreen's part.

148
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,831
I don't think he has a problem with pot.

149
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,602
Let's hope.

150
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,534
How's the weather business?

151
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,115
<i>Last September...</i>

152
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,249
<i>I had encouraged Shelly to explore</i>
<i>some other activities and interests.</i>

153
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,727
<i>She picked archery.</i>

154
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,393
<i>So I took her to an archery range</i>
<i>in Bolingbrook.</i>

155
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,516
<i>It was a 90-minute drive.</i>

156
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:15,533
<i>It was a 90-minute drive.</i>

157
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,237
<i>We purchased a junior bow-arrow kit...</i>

158
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,534
<i>and a leather wrist/forearm guard.</i>

159
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,472
Okay, we'll take that.

160
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,411
<i>And private lessons.</i>

161
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,949
All right, Shelly.

162
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,886
You take that one...

163
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,120
and go right ahead.

164
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,166
All right. Okay, just remember...

165
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,465
pull it straight back,
parallel to your ear, okay?

166
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,563
You can do it, Shelly.

167
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,348
<i>We purchased a five-pack lesson plan.</i>

168
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,446
<i>We haven't been back.</i>

169
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,118
Hello?

170
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,525
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

171
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,663
<i>Can you pick up Mike</i>
<i>at the mall on North?</i>

172
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,867
I thought he was at a friend's house.
Paul Norris.

173
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,062
<i>They went to the mall.</i>
<i>He just called me.</i>

174
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,504
<i>- He finished his rehab.</i>
- Okay.

175
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,378
- That's one of my counselors.
- In your program?

176
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,349
Don Boden. He's pretty nice.

177
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,721
- He swears all the time, though.
- Swears?

178
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,951
Yeah. To relate, I guess.
But he's pretty nice.

179
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,462
Hey, Don.

180
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,472
- What are you guys doing?
- Looking for clothes.

181
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,975
You're just looking for clothes.

182
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,938
- Yeah.
- That's great.

183
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,713
I'm looking for clothes.

184
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,673
Okay.

185
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,413
- This is Paul.
- What's up?

186
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,488
Hey.

187
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,483
It's cold today.

188
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,287
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no kidding.

189
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,224
What is it, like, 20 or something?

190
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,523
Yeah, like 22.

191
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,025
Yeah. Fuck.

192
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,099
Yeah.

193
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,837
Hey.

194
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,601
- Yeah, I like this.
- It's good-looking.

195
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,835
Yeah, I've been looking
for something like this.

196
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,275
Chuck it in here.

197
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,913
- What?
- Chuck it in.

198
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,849
I'm loading up. I got a discount card.
I'll get it for you.

199
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,749
- That's all right.
- Mike, big deal.

200
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,550
- I can get it.
- Bro, I got a serious discount.

201
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,716
It's gonna cost, like, $7.

202
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,227
- I'm gonna take off. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

203
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,773
That's my dad. I'll see you later.

204
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,671
Sure. I'll catch you later.

205
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,589
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,954
- Who's that?
- Don Boden.

207
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,327
- Who's Don Boden?
- He's one of my counselors.

208
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,397
Oh.

209
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,930
- That's a nice sweater.
- Thanks.

210
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,509
I'll walk you up.

211
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,646
Hi.

212
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,182
Hi. Thanks for getting Mike.

213
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,853
- Hey, how was your thing?
- It was good.

214
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,930
- I'll see you, Dad.
- Okay, Mike.

215
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,962
- I think he's gonna be okay.
- Well, we'll see.

216
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,770
What's new?

217
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,505
Nothing much.

218
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,108
I got a feeler from <i>Hello America.</i>

219
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,077
- What?
- I got a feeler.

220
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,009
Dales is leaving it.
I might get called to audition.

221
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,414
New York.

222
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,751
- If I get called.
- That's good.

223
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,524
What about the kids?

224
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,656
It's just a shot in the dark, that's all.

225
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,225
Well, thanks for getting Mike.

226
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,366
I had to take my dad
to Northwestern for a test...

227
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,562
so I was right there, anyway.

228
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,797
- Oh, is he okay?
- I think so. It was just a test.

229
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,678
Noreen!

230
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,385
Are you okay?

231
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,692
Yeah.

232
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,525
Fuck! What are you doing?

233
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,600
I was just... You turned into it.

234
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,066
I think you cracked the glass.

235
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,745
So do you have everything you need?

236
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,182
<i>Yeah, we got everything.</i>

237
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,255
<i>We'll pare it down to three applicants</i>
<i>after we watch the tapes.</i>

238
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,586
<i>- We'll call if you're one, Dave.</i>
- Okay, Mark.

239
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,283
It's nice to make your acquaintance.

240
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,724
<i>- You, too. Take care.</i>
- Hey, weatherman!

241
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,886
All right. Bye.

242
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:44,963
Fuck!

243
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,833
Fuck.

244
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,068
David?

245
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,136
Hey.

246
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,468
- What happened?
- I got hit with a Frosty.

247
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,769
- Why?
- What?

248
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,768
Why did you get hit with a Frosty?
What is a Frosty?

249
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,441
A Frosty is a shake from Wendy's.

250
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,913
Why would someone throw
a shake at you?

251
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,259
- That happens sometimes.
- People throw shakes at you?

252
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,827
Stuff. People throw stuff
at me sometimes...

253
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,660
- if they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

254
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,391
- If they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

255
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,796
From TV.

256
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,333
But you just read the weather.

257
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,167
Well, I predict it.

258
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,801
You don't have a degree in meteorology.

259
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,274
I make suppositions, or I...

260
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,603
What are you doing?

261
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,739
- I walked over.
- You walked? It's freezing.

262
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,485
I have lymphoma, David.

263
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,245
What?

264
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,023
I have lymphoma.

265
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,287
- Doctor Pritch called.
- What?

266
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,429
I was having tremors.
That's the reason that I went in.

267
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,934
Pritch read my scans.

268
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,828
- What's the prognosis?
- Well, it's not good.

269
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,874
We'll talk about it this week.
I wanted to tell you.

270
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,333
Yeah.

271
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,845
I'll call you
after I've talked to Pritch again.

272
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,220
I'll drive you home.

273
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,018
I like the fresh air.

274
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,854
- Well, I'll walk back with you.
- No, that's okay.

275
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,088
Okay.

276
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,349
<i>Every couple months,</i>
<i>someone throws something at me...</i>

277
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,420

00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,558
<i>Why? My name, partly, I guess.</i>

279
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,960
<i>I changed it for professional reasons.</i>

280
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,791
<i>My first station manager suggested it.</i>

281
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,632
<i>He said it sounded refreshing</i>
<i>and that they wanted that quality.</i>

282
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,265
<i>That may be true, but it's also annoying.</i>
<i>I know that.</i>

283
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,076
What kind of name is Spritz?

284
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,410
It's a bullshit name. It's a TV name.

285
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,647
He's bullshit.

286
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,216
Well, I like him. He's handsome.

287
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,319
He's an asshole.

288
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,891
I don't like his face.

289
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,021
His asshole face.

290
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,892

00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:47,990
Thanks.

313
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,916
Tricia's a bitch.

314
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,351
She's a little cunt.

00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,856
I hate that little cunt.

316
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,361

Hi.

319
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,005
Today's the company party.
I thought I'd take the kids.

320
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,084
Oh.

321
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,213
Well, Mike is out.

322
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,386
- Shelly's home?
- She's walking Jackson.

323
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,021
- Where do you want to take them?
- The rink. WCH.

324
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:52,930
Hey.

325
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:56,834
Hey.

326
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,694
What?

327
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,502
Dave.

328
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,204
Hey, Tim.

329
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,408
- I didn't know you were coming.
- I always come to these...

330
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,081
when I can.

331
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,687
I have some time this week if you want
to go back up to Bolingbrook.

332
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,625
- What's in Bolingbrook?
- Sportsman's. The archery range.

333
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,628
- Okay.
- Okay? You wanna go?

334
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,855
Okay, I remember it.

335

336
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,567
Sometimes.

337
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,717

338
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,775

- Just keep up, Shell. Come on.
- I'm trying to.

347
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,707
We should finish.

348
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,877
We're last. We're way last.

349
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,313
There's a lesson here. Let's finish.

350
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,608
I'm hurt.

351
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,310
Hon, you can do it.
You can finish. Okay?

352
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,946
I don't want you to quit.
It's gonna mean a lot to Dad. Okay?

353
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,481
All right.

354
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,583
Let's go.

355
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,728
That's my girl. That's it.

356
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,755
Good. I'm proud of you.

357
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,399
Okay?

358
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,308
Yay! That was great!

359
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,937
Hon. Hon, you okay?

360
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,406
You shouldn't have made me finish!

361
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,041
That was like 100 yards
you made me go.

362
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,713
I'm not a football-jocker.

363
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,587
What happened?

364
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,856
Just... We got tangled up in a sack.

365
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,023
- What happened?
- She tore her ACL.

366
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,225
These fucking crutches are too long!

367
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,030
- What did you say?
- Shelly!

368
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,899
- Well, what were you doing?
- It was a picnic.

369
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,841
- And she tore something?
- ACL. MCL.

370
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,138
Which?

371
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,505
Both.

372
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,845
- Dave!
- Well, we didn't go bungee jumping!

373
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,713
It was a fucking potato-sack race!

374
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,980
- That's where she got it.
- What?

375
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,056
"Fucking" this. "Fucking" that.

376
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,817
No, I never said that around her.

377
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,759
You don't know you have, Dave,
because you don't pay attention!

378
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,760
Fuck that.

379
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,656
What?

380
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,428
- Just fuck that, Noreen. You know...
- Dave.

381
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,196
- What?
- Step back.

382
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,606
- Step back?
- Step back.

383
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,169
What are you talking about, Russ?

384
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,607
- Russ...
- Step back right now.

385
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,676
- Fuck you, right now.
- Fuck you, Spritz.

386
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,815
Fuck you, fat asshole!

387
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,477
Dildo!

388
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,350
David, what are you doing?

389
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,582
I'm talking to my wife!
I'm talking to Noreen...

390
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,420
and this clown,
whose business this isn't.

391
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,086
You call me a dildo,
it is my business, Spritz.

392
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,687
You are a dildo, pork-fuck. You porker!

393
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,191
Stop, Son.

394
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,558
Would you?

395
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,136
Why don't you go?

396
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,501
Why are you here? Are you okay?

397
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,575
I came to talk to Noreen.

398
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,139
Dave, come on. I will talk to you later.

399
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,948
- Dave, what's going on, Son?
- It's nothing. Just...

400
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,887
Why are you here, anyway?

401
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,585
I came to talk to Noreen
about an issue concerning Shelly.

402
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,863
Well, you can talk to me.
I'm her parent, too. So? What?

403
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:24,031
Shelly dresses in clothing
not appropriate for her...

404
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,859
clinging stuff.

405
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,504
All kids wear...
Dad, it's a different generation.

406
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,009
They call her camel toe.

407
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,172
- What?
- Are you aware of that?

408
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,715
What?

409
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,376
That her colleagues call her camel toe.

410
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,782
What are you talking about?

411
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,683
It means the crease in her vagina...

412
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,086
that they can discern
through her clothing.

413
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,818
- What?
- Camel toe.

414
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,622
Yeah, I heard you.
I mean, how do you know they do that?

415
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,855
I heard it.

416
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:57,027
I picked Shelly up on Wednesday,
heard taunting, the older boys calling it.

417
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,365
- You might have heard wrong.
- No, I heard camel...

418
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,904
Okay, okay, look. I'll deal.

419
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,495
I want to get her through this ACL thing.

420
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,699
I'm gonna take her shooting.

421
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,832
I'm gonna reapply her there.

422
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,275
I'm gonna get her talking to me.
I'm gonna get to her...

423
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,346
and I'm gonna work it out.

424
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,596
<i>A camel toe is pretty much</i>
<i>what Robert said it was.</i>

425
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:36,773
<i>It's basically just when you</i>
<i>can make out more than you should.</i>

426
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,237
<i>But it's the kind of thing...</i>

427
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,042
<i>She's 12, you know?</i>

428
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,012
<i>If you're around and paying attention,</i>
<i>you catch it...</i>

429
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:51,054
<i>then name-calling doesn't start,</i>
<i>and maybe smoking doesn't start.</i>

430
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:55,457
<i>And maybe she can just stay</i>
<i>a happy kid for a couple more years.</i>

431
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,592
<i>She shouldn't be unhappy.</i>

432
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:02,325
<i>Fuck. What did she ever do</i>
<i>to anybody? Shelly.</i>

433
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,506
- Hello.
<i>- Hey.</i>

434
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,810
Hey.

435
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,109
<i>Listen.</i>

436
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,543
<i>Noreen, I was thinking...</i>

437
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,210
this pushing and pulling...

438
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,854
the tug-of-war we do sometimes...

439
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,155
<i>it's not good for the kids.</i>

440
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,350
It's not.

441
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:33,090
Noreen, let's see somebody.
Work it out. Let's...

442
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,790
- Fuck!
- Asshole!

443
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,527
Are you okay?

444
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,065
- I got hit with a pop!
<i>- What?</i>

445
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,534
A fucking...

446
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,775
A Big Gulp.

447
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,240
- Man.
<i>- Are you okay? Are you okay?</i>

448
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,476
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. So...

449
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,411
what I was saying...

450
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:57,981
See somebody?

451
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:02,388
We're going to begin
with some trust-building exercises.

452
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:05,189
The Buddy Drop. Up on your feet.
Let's go.

453
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,329
Dave, Noreen. Center circle.

454
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,262
Okay.

455
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,638
Now, Noreen,
you're just gonna let yourself go...

456
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,341
and Dave is gonna catch you.

457
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,705
- Just go back?
- Yeah. Cross your arms up front.

458
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,511
- Now?
- Whenever you're ready.

459
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:28,876
Okay.

460
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,024
Good. Very good.

461
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,551
All right, Teresa, Mark. You're up.

462
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,787
Okay.

463
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:42,163
Now I want you to name something...

464
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,433
that you did that affected your partner...

465
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,897
and that you're not proud of.

466
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,576
I had this thing with porno
on the computer, sort of.

467
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,010
I got a little preoccupied...

468
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,742
Actually, I want you to write it down,
not say it.

469
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,817
Okay.

470
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,614
I want you to put it on the paper
that you got for a reason.

471
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,687
Okay.

472
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,818
Now make sure it's something
the other person doesn't know about...

473
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,957
that they don't know.

474
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,737
All right.

475
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,139
Then you are going to give it
to the other person...

476
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,979
and the other person
is never going to look at it.

477
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,506
Ever.

478
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,819
That's trust.

479
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,739
What's up?

480
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,225
<i>I thought Dave's science-fiction novel,</i>
<i>or whatever it was...</i>

481
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,797
<i>was stupid and sucked...</i>

482
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,866
<i>and was a waste of time.</i>

483
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,936
<i>It was embarrassing. Four years?</i>

484
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,114
Well, I thought that went pretty well.

485
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,048
Yeah.

486
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,638
It wasn't science fiction,
just so you know.

487
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,575
- What?
- It wasn't science fiction.

488
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,310
- What are you talking about?
- Did you even read it?

489
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,780
No. One of the side characters
was a scientist...

490
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,408
- but that's not even important...
- God damn it, Dave. God damn it!

491
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,352
What? I'm just asking,
did you ever even read it?

492
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,185
It was hard to read.
It was poorly written.

493
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,626
You're an asshole. God.

494
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,552
You are a champion asshole.

495
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,291
You're a real blue-ribbon fuck!

496
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,836
I just wanna make it work, Noreen.

497
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:38,068
I just want to know everything,
so I can make it work. That's why I...

498
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,205
- I want to try again.
- I'm not going back. You fucked it up.

499
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,307
I mean, our marriage.

500
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,773
What?

501
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,422
I want to try again.

502
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,853
Fuck you.

503
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,792
You know, Dave, you can't even...

504
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,691
You looked at it. That's dishonest.
It's crappy.

505
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,393
- Noreen.
- Hey, should I look at yours?

506
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,932
That's all right.

507
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,505
No. No, no, Noreen...

508
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,975
"Throughout marriage
BJs lacked enthusiasm.

509
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,107
"Had difference of opinion
over how important that was.

510
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,545
"I thought very."

511
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,879
You know what, Dave?

512
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,055
You want to know
why my BJs lacked enthusiasm?

513
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,486
I hated you.

514
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,026
I hated your hair.

515
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,527
I hated your ugly legs, your forearms.

516
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:39,196
I hated kissing your lips, Dave. Okay?

517
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:43,364
And that's why I lacked enthusiasm
when your cock was in my mouth.

518
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:46,937
Hey, hon.

519
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,604
Shelly, it's cold.

520
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:54,184
Your father said it was going to be
65 degrees today, but...

521
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,083
Go ahead. I'll see you later.

522
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,722
How did it go?

523
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,315
Good.

524
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,430
I'll call you tomorrow. Go ahead in.

525
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,310
Did you start my novel yet?

526
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,777
What's that?

527
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,015
<i>Breaking Point.</i> Did you start that?

528
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,051
No, I haven't yet, Son.
I've been preoccupied.

529
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,293
Well, that's good, actually.

530
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,458
I want to make some changes, so...

531
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,303
I'll give you the new one.

532
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,150
What did he say?

533
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,480
It's further bad news.

534
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,526
The metastatic plane
was too wide for radiation.

535
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,388
He suggested I see a Dr. Frost
in New York for clinical trials.

536
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,311
I got a feeler from <i>Hello America.</i>

537
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,776
National.

538
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,976
They're looking at 20 guys, but
they'll be cutting down to three soon.

539
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,781
It's a possibility.

540
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,617
The salary's great. It's real strong.

541
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:43,951
It would mean moving...

542
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,359
but I'd like to move everybody,
you know?

543
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,432
Renew things with Noreen.

544
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,867
We've been seeing somebody.

545
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,397
Let the kids start over in New York.

546
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,803
Keep them away from some
of the bad influences here that...

547
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,776
Just get a fresh start.

548
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,579
I think that would be great.

549
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,577
- That would be terrific.
- Yeah.

550
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,820
You could rededicate yourselves,
knuckle down.

551
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,965
What's this?

552
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:28,903
It's a Big Gulp.

553
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,116
You should say,
"We might see some snow...

554
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,378
"but it might shift south, miss us."

555
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,784
I can say it,
but I sort of wanna understand it.

556
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,016
Why is it?

557
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,726
Well, it's Canadian trade winds.

558
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,826
Behind all of it?

559
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,727
Yeah, this will get pushed by wind
out of Canada.

560
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,198
- So what's it gonna do?
- I don't know.

561
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,833
It's a guess.

562
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,240
It's wind, man. Blows all over the place.

563
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,271
<i>For some reason...</i>

564
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,107
<i>I don't know.</i>

565
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,049
<i>I went back to Bolingbrook.</i>

566
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,444
<i>I bought a three-month lesson plan.</i>

567
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,780
Hang on.
Before you do that, you know...

568
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,448
let's go out here
and do a little stretching exercises.

569
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,547
You got to rotate your...

570
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,217
<i>We warm up...</i>

571
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,991
<i>then do basic focus drills,</i>
<i>stuff you never think about.</i>

572
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,897
<i>Like closing an eye</i>
<i>without moving your face...</i>

573
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,993
<i>because your face</i>
<i>is the anchor point for your hand...</i>

574
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,372
<i>that allows you to focus.</i>

575
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,469
<i>You have to keep your triangle</i>
<i>against a lot of force.</i>

576
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,027
<i>We do draws for a half hour,</i>
<i>then releases.</i>

577
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,134
<i>That's called "loosing,"</i>
<i>when you release.</i>

578
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,879
Great shot! All right!

579
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,788
<i>It's hard...</i>

580
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,690
<i>but that one good shot</i>
<i>leaves you thinking...</i>

581
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,786
<i>you might be catching on.</i>

582
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,559
<i>Do you lift weights?</i>

583
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,260
- What's that?
- Do you lift weights?

584
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,625
Yeah.

585
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,266
- Cardio?
- Yeah, you have to do both.

586
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,830
Yeah.

587
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,411
Are you on any kind of a program?

588
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,140
Yeah, our gym coach
gave us a program.

589
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,481
- That should be good.
- Yeah.

590
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,443
Yeah.

591
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,516
Fuck.

592
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,590
Hey.

593
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,059
- You know what would be interesting?
- What?

594
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,255
We should take some pictures.
Some shots, like...

595
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,590
some now,
some in a month or whatever...

596
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,691
see if you're making gains.

597
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,803
Yeah.

598
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,495
I've got my mom's Nikon.

599
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,472
- Whip your shirt off.
- Whip my shirt off?

600
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,935
Yeah.

601
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,654
You're shredded.

602
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,428
This is great, man.

603
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,160
We can compare this shit.

604
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,869
That's a Nikon FM?

605
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,967
Well, yeah.
You know something about cameras?

606
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,472
Yeah. I took a class at Parker.

607
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,437
A couple more.

608
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,315
My dad's gonna get the F3 for me...

609
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,048
if I can finish the program
and maintain a B average.

610
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,614
It's like a $600 camera.
I'm psyched about it.

611
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,690
I could loan that to you.

612
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,321
Yeah?

613
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,863
I could loan that shit to you if...

614
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,294
you wanted it earlier.

615
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,761
Okay.

616
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,045
This is gonna go a lot better.

617
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,145
Why?

618
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,878
Because I got you some bobtail arrows.
They're easier.

619
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,415
Why?

620
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,017
Well, they're thicker at the ends.

621
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,786
See? They taper toward the nock.

622
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,259
- What's the nock?
- The arrow end.

623
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:51,058
- What was I using before?
- Chested arrows.

624
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,594
That guy didn't know
what he was doing.

625
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,170
Okay.

626
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,905
Fletch it.

627
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,647
- What?
- Fix your arrow in.

628
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,949
That's the term.

629
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:12,278
Arrow makers were called fletchers.
That's where the last name came from.

630
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,914
Here. There's a little bit of a...

631
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,396
It takes a little while.
Right there, right below the nock.

632
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,057
There!

633
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,826
Awesome!

634
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,936
Okay, let's loose a few.

635
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,039
Let's show our stuff.

636
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,466
Aim about a half-foot above.

637
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,839
- Okay.
- You wait till you're steady.

638
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,405
- Are you aligned?
- Yeah.

639
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,346
Okay. Let it go.

640
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,744
Fuck!

641
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,945
Come on, Shelly. Get your arrow.

642
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,920
We probably didn't home long enough.

643
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,552
That's the pause between drawing back
and firing.

644
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,964
Let's pause a little longer.

645
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,728
What?

646
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,633
Nothing.

647
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,267
- Are you just not interested?
- Yeah.

648
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,805
Yeah, you're not interested?
Or, yeah, you are interested?

649
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,505
Yeah, I'm not. Really.

650
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,486
What was it you liked?
Let's think of it that way.

651
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,083
What?

652
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:23,856
What interested you
when you thought about archery?

653
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,290
When you wanted to do it.

654
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,596
I don't know.
Going hunting or something.

655
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:32,930
Hunting?

656
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,437
Yeah.

657
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,364
- For animals?
- Yeah.

658
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,308
You wanna shoot animals with arrows?

659
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,277
- Yeah.
- You do?

660
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,444
Yeah, to kill them.

661
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,616
But that's not archery. That's hunting.

662
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,916
That's called bowhunting.
That's what you wanted to do?

663
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,719
- Bowhunting?
- Yeah, I saw it on TV.

664
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:01,463
Well, I don't really wanna kill animals
with arrows...

665
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,090
so that's not going to happen.
We can target shoot, Shelly.

666
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,260
- It's not fun.
- It's a lot of fun.

667
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,894
- You have to apply yourself.
- Targets don't move.

668
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,735
Well, you know, Shelly...

669
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,240
you haven't really hit one yet.

670
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,469
You should support me.

671
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:17,638
I do support you. I support.

672
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,751
All right, forget it. Take your bracer off.

673
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,153
- We're not shooting anymore.
- Okay.

674
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,011
There's a chance
I might be going to New York.

675
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,376
A small chance.

676
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,610
You think you'd like to come,
maybe, if I go?

677
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:56,944
Yeah.

678
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,147
We could maybe go with Poppop.

679
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,690
- He's got some tests.
- Yeah.

680
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,703
Hey.

681
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,106
Hey, Mike.

682
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,006
You don't look real good, Dad.

683
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,908
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

684
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,708
- What are you doing out here?
- Just sitting here.

685
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,209
Sometimes I just sit here
and look at the house.

686
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,920
- You park here sometimes?
- Yeah. Sometimes.

687
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,894
I just like to see you guys.
I see you playing guitar up there.

688
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,024
Okay.

689
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,962
- Sounds good.
- Thanks.

690
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,331
- You know, Poppop...
- Yeah.

691
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,697
...he's sick.
- Mom said.

692
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,301
I was thinking about that, too.

693
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,580
Why do you have a bow and arrow
in there?

694
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,213
I was just out with Shelly.
I'm not playing favorites.

695
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,788
I just think we need to be together
for a while.

696
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,516
Yeah, that's okay.

697
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:43,721
- How's your program going?
- Great.

698
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,895
You're gonna get that camera
if you keep it up!

699
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,608
<i>Look at this house.</i>

700
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,371
<i>Someone should be happy here.</i>

701
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,015
<i>How did I fuck this up?</i>

702
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,015
<i>Seriously.</i>

703
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,880
<i>What if I remembered the tartar sauce?</i>
<i>Would things be different?</i>

704
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,726
<i>Would Robert die</i>
<i>not thinking I'm a jerk-off...</i>

705
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,389
<i>jerk-fuck?</i>

706
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,856
Don't forget the tartar sauce.

707
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:23,990
Just call the order in, Noreen...

708
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,626
and quit busting
my you-know-what, okay?

709
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,069
You always half-listen
to what I'm saying to you!

710
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,037
I heard you. Tartar sauce.

711
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,936
<i>Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce.</i>
<i>Tartar sauce.</i>

712
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,175
<i>Tartar sauce, tartar sauce,</i>
<i>tartar sauce, tartar sauce.</i>

713
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,851
<i>Man, how I'd like</i>
<i>to put my face in there.</i>

714
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,585
<i>Right in there. Tartar sauce.</i>

715
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,896
<i>My hips are cold. Tartar sauce.</i>

716
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,590
<i>That's when you know it's cold.</i>

717
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,497
<i>I like eating pussy. Tartar sauce.</i>

718
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,069
<i>A lot of guys don't.</i>
<i>Well, maybe they do.</i>

719
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,638
<i>Maybe that's just black guys.</i>
<i>Tartar sauce.</i>

720
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,207
<i>What happened to the guy</i>
<i>who was trying to go around the world...</i>

721
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,537
<i>in a balloon? Did he make it?</i>

722
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:07,905
<i>I should put some espionage...</i>

723
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,911
<i>or stolen plutonium in my novel.</i>
<i>Tartar sauce.</i>

724
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,846
<i>Spice it up. Neil Young. Fuck, it's cold!</i>

725
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,012
<i>Neil Young?</i>
<i>Why am I thinking about Neil Young?</i>

726
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,280
<i>Neil Diamond. Neil.</i>
<i>There's not a lot of famous Neils.</i>

727
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,049
<i>Is this Wednesday?</i>
<i>I wish I had two dicks.</i>

728
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,126
<i>I thought the whole family was going</i>
<i>to learn Spanish together this year.</i>

729
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,853
<i>That never really happened.</i>

730
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:25,991
<i>I haven't had a Spanish omelet</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

731
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:27,020
<i>I haven't had a Spanish omelet</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

732
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,562
<i>Here we go.</i>

733
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:33,332
Anything else?

734
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,329
No.

735
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,402
Where is the tartar sauce?

736
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,072
They were out. They apologized.

737
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,479
- They were cool about it.
- They were out?

738
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,721
- They were out.
- They were out of tartar sauce?

739
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,455
I'm calling them.

740
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,252
Fuck, Noreen.

741
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,863
It's not about the tartar sauce.
It's about you. You don't care!

742
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,730
I don't care about tartar sauce!

743
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,428
I'm trying to make a living for this family.

744
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,732
I've got work things to think about
and pressure.

745
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,001
Tartar sauce?
Fuck, Noreen, are you serious?

746
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,542
You are so selfish!

747
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,380
I would do anything for you...

748
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,940
- Everything you say is right.
...as if we're not happy.

749
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,422
- I'm trying to take care of the family.
- You come in here, looked in my face...

750
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,685
and you lied to me, Dave.

751
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,557
Do you think I'm a moron? "They're out."

752
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,891
<i>We both just think it's better</i>
<i>for the kids.</i>

753
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,932
David, sacrifice is...

754
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:48,639
To get anything of value,
you have to sacrifice.

755
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,407
I know that, Dad. But I think
if we continue down this road...

756
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,176
it's going to be too detrimental
for the kids.

757
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,978
It's just too hard.

758
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,919
Do you know that the harder thing to do
and the right thing to do...

759
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:01,682
are usually the same thing?

760
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,754
Nothing that has meaning is easy.

761
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,857
Easy doesn't enter into grown-up life.

762
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,377
I'm not comfortable
with an 18-degree variance.

763
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,950
- Why even forecast?
- It's a technical art...

764
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,022
not a science. People get that.

765
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:36,456
- Let's narrow it down, Tim.
- Dave, it's random.

766
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,394
We do our best.

767
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,789
A day can have that variance.

768
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,665
- Dave, phone call.
- Tell him to take a message.

769
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,236
It's <i>Hello America.</i>

770
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,460
Can we shop here?

771
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,255
Sure. Where is that?

772
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,158
- Bendel.
- All right.

773
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,103
Dad?

774
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,911
You know what? Let's go for a walk.
Take a break.

775
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,614
You don't like it?

776
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,816
No, maybe we'll come back later.
We'll just take a break.

777
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,823
- So how's everything going?
- Good.

778
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,933
- How's school?
- Good.

779
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,301
- Dance school?
- Good.

780
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,770
You know, when I was in school...

781
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:01,970
I guess the hardest thing
was how other kids can be a little mean.

782
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,503
Names and stuff.

783
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,908
Do you ever get called names?

784
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,483
Like what?

785
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:14,653
I don't know, like "dummy"
if you miss a question...

786
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,555
or "camel toe."

787
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,991
Yeah. Camel toe.

788
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,091
Do you know why?

789
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,730
Why what?

790
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,637
Why you get called camel toe?

791
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:29,798
Yeah.

792
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:33,935
Why, hon?

793
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:38,239
Because camel toes are tough.

794
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,783
They can walk all over the desert
and all the hot rocks.

795
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,217
I'm tough.

796
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,454
That's right. It's because they're tough.

797
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,691
You ready to shop again?

798
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,964
I think they make car tires
out of camel toes.

799
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,402
Yeah, I think I heard that.

800
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,437
I just think you're more grown-up
than that other stuff.

801
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,072
I don't think I like it.

802
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,208
But that was sort of kid stuff.

803
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,116
I like this dress. It's New York style.

804
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,319
Let me see.

805
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,731
Hey.

806
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,432
- You like it?
- I like it. Yeah.

807
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,394
Do you like it?

808
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,404
Yeah, I think I do.

809
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:40,135
Do you feel comfortable in it?
Because, you know, that's the thing.

810
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,044
Yeah, it's comfy.

811
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,243
You look great.

812
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,378
You look all grown-up.

813
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,784
Okay, change. Let's get some more.

814
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:49,874
Really?

815
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,012
Sure, and then we'll go show Poppop
some of this stuff.

816
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,945
Poppop! Poppop!

817
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,414
- Check this out.
- That's nice, hon.

818
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,821
I know. I got a lot more, too!

819
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,454
Dave.

820
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,294
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right.

821
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,301
Mike got arrested.

822
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,293
What?

823
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:45,502
He fucked his drug counselor's car up.
They were on their way to a movie.

824
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:52,878
A movie?

825
00:55:56,653 --> 00:56:00,214
Mike said he was trying to suck him off.

826
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,760
Then Mike chucked a rock
through his car's passenger window.

827
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,788
What is this sucking
and chucking rocks?

828
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,663
I mean, what is this?

829
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,694
What did the guy say?

830
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,206
He said Mike tried to jack his wallet.

831
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:29,847
What is this sucking and chucking
and jacking and fucking-up, Son?

832
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,010
He's 15 years old!

833
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,389
What is this shit?

834
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,986
- Where is he?
- He's at home.

835
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:39,892
What is this?

836
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,489
Fuck.

837
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,233
Are you ready for the doctors?

838
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,033
Yeah.

839
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,609
Got you! You're dead.

840
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,686
I think just what he said happened,
happened.

841
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,721
I think the guy was trying
to make a move on him...

842
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,881
and Mike got surprised and scared.

843
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:11,358
Hon, will you get me a pop
from the pop machine?

844
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,619
<i>Can you get your pop later?</i>

845
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,927
I'm trying to send Shelly away
so she doesn't have to hear this.

846
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:20,730
<i>This guy says that Mike</i>
<i>tried to steal his wallet...</i>

847
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:24,204
<i>and that's why they were fighting</i>
<i>when the police came.</i>

848
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,367
- How is he?
<i>- He's scared. I don't know.</i>

849
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,045
I can come home.

850
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,014
<i>No, stay there</i>
<i>and do your</i> Hello America <i>thing.</i>

851
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,946
- You act like...
<i>- What?</i>

852
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:38,977
Like Mike's in trouble...

853
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,682
'cause I'm interviewing
at <i>Hello America.</i> Give me a break!

854
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,349
I don't have any money.

855
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,594
<i>Russ is helping anyway.</i>

856
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:51,997
- That dildo's what?
<i>- He's been a big help, okay?</i>

857
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,926
<i>You can stay there.</i>

858
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,629
Fine. I'll stay here with camel toe.

859
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:57,729
You just take care of stuff there!
You take care of it!

860
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,604
<i>Camel toe? What are you talking about?</i>

861
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,973
I had to find out how kids
taunt Shelly about that...

862
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,340
and you're letting her get taunted.

863
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,539
You're not paying attention
to the way she goes to school!

864
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,115
<i>I take care of everything around here.</i>

865
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,241
Well, I bought her new stuff.

866
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,784
I bought her a bunch
of brand new stuff...

867
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,411
- and she told me all kinds of stuff, so...
<i>- Don't be such a dick.</i>

868
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,012
<i>You have her for one weekend.</i>

869
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,023
You know what, Noreen? Just...

870
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,793
Fuck! Whatever. Let me talk to Mike.

871
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,296
<i>He's sleeping,</i>
<i>and don't talk to me like that.</i>

872
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,696
More dildo, more fucking...

873
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,001
Listen, I have to go, Noreen.
I'll talk to you soon.

874
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,332
<i>Whatever.</i>

875
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,002
I thought you were trying
to improve matters with Noreen...

876
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,577
if not reconcile.

877
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,703
I am. What did Frost say?

878
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,810
He wants to speak to me
in about 10 minutes.

879
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,612
It was cold in there.

880
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,249
Would you get me a coffee, Dave?
So I can warm up.

881
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:47,984
Yeah, Dad.

882
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,488
Dildo. Jacking...

883
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,063
Hi.

884
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,501
Hi. $0.65.

885
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:09,203
Fuck.

886
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,441
- Hey.
- Hi.

887
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,106
Poppop went in?

888
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,243
- Yeah.
- Great. Yeah. He wanted a coffee.

889
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:18,877
Do you have my wallet?

890
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,621
You only had $1.

891
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,429
You should carry more money than that.

892
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,657
I know.

893
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,805
Well, did he say
whether any more therapy could...

894
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:48,313
No, he didn't have a different opinion
than Pritch.

895
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,945
There's too large a plane.

896
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:55,924
It's a no-go.

897
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,062
- Well, did he say...
- He said months.

898
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,962
- Did he say a lot of months?
- Well, what's a lot?

899
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,835
I don't know, like 12.

900
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,242
Well, if he meant 12,
he probably would've said a year, Son.

901
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,272
I think he meant three or four.

902
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,635
Well, you have a big day tomorrow.

903
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,536
The <i>Hello America</i> show.

904
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:45,733
Yeah.

905
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,539
<i>... and here comes the grand marshal,</i>
<i>Dave Spritzel.</i>

906
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,474
<i>Didn't his name used to be Spritz?</i>

907
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:56,738
<i>Yeah, it sure did...</i>

908
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,076
<i>but he changed it back</i>
<i>to the original Spritzel.</i>

909
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,240
<i>Why the change, Ed?</i>

910
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,544
<i>Well, when you're national,</i>
<i>there's no more up.</i>

911
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:03,710
<i>So he changed it back...</i>

912
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,551
<i>like John "Cougar" Mellencamp.</i>
<i>He's realer now and more authentic.</i>

913
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:10,785
<i>- Who's that with him?</i>
<i>- Those are the wife and kids.</i>

914
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,418
<i>Didn't they used to have</i>
<i>a real fucked-up relationship?</i>

915
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,054
<i>Not anymore.</i>
<i>That's something else that changed.</i>

916
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,258
<i>It seems</i>
Hello America <i>with Byrant Gumbel...</i>

917
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,800
<i>gave them all a fresh start...</i>

918
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:24,498
<i>and an increase in salary to $980,000</i>
<i>outside promotional fees...</i>

919
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:27,872
<i>which puts Dave</i>
<i>well over $1 million a year.</i>

920
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:32,648
<i>- That got his wife's ear, I bet.</i>
<i>- You bet. That buys a lot of face time.</i>

921
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,148
<i>Now everything's great.</i>

922
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,117
<i>- Did he say that?</i>
<i>- Yeah, he told me that...</i>

923
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,521
Hello, America.

924
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,461
<i>What are your hobbies?</i>

925
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,963
Writing. Archery.

926
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,539
And you don't have a degree
in meteorology?

927
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,344
General communications.

928
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,944
Well, listen. We've seen a lot
of your work in Chicago.

929
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,018
Okay.

930
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,855
We think you're great, refreshing.

931
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,884
We love the Spritz Nipper.

932
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,151
Great.

933
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,456
Why don't we run some blue screen,
and we'll do a walk-through on the set?

934
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,587
Great.

935
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,502
Here's your station.
We'll run some screen.

936
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,575
Give me a second to set it up.

937
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,568
- Hi.
- Hi.

938
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,104
I'm waiting for Mark.
I'm running some screen.

939
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,765
- Dave.
- Bryant.

940
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,933
- Nervous?
- No.

941
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:44,913
- Sure?
- Yeah.

942
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:48,416
You look just a little bit nervous.

943
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:49,814
It's not nerves.

944
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,220
- Other shit.
- Yeah.

945
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,290
...mild in the Northwest.

946
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,055
As this high-pressure system
gives way...

947
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:01,720
we'll see warm temperatures
in New Mexico...

948
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:03,560
<i>I know it's not neurosurgery...</i>

949
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,897
<i>but green screen is the one part</i>
<i>of my job that's not really easy.</i>

950
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,665
...35 in New York with colder
temperatures west to Michigan...

951
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:12,104
<i>You need a sense of where put-ons</i>
<i>will come from...</i>

952
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,971
<i>and a pretty strong sense of scale.</i>

953
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,169
...there are travel advisories
in New Orleans and Atlanta.

954
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,268
It's pretty heavy weather...

955
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,177
<i>I've gotten real good at it.</i>

956
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,883
<i>I thought everything went over</i>
<i>pretty well.</i>

957
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,317
So we'll let you know
in a couple of days.

958
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,549
Okay.

959
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,821
This is my father, Robert Spritzel,
and my daughter.

960
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,493
We're a little late for our plane...

961
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,824
so we thought we'd leave from here.

962
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,092
- Yeah, I'm sorry. We kept you late.
- That's cool.

963
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,689
- So you've got the numbers?
- Yes.

964
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,133
There's a built-in with Purina
I forgot. $42,000.

965
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,204
Okay.

966
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,533
- What's a built-in?
- It's a compulsory endorsement...

967
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,471
if I'm offered the job.

968
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,969
- Dog food?
- Yeah. Pet products.

969
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,448
Dave doesn't own a pet.

970
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,646
Well, I have Jackson.

971
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,679
Jackson lives with your wife and kids.

972
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,319
We'll let you know.

973
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,071
- Russ is here.
- Okay.

974
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,281
- Where's Mike?
- Inside.

975
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,413
- Dave.
- Hi, Russ.

976
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,993
He's upstairs.
He's still pretty upset about it.

977
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,188
- Did he talk about it?
- Yeah.

978
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:46,495
- To you?
- He's told us what happened.

979
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:49,366
He was with his counselor, Don Boden.
I guess he...

980
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,737
<i>I don't really know why</i>
<i>what happened next happened.</i>

981
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:57,271
<i>He was talking about my son,</i>
<i>and I was taking my gloves off.</i>

982
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,012
Apparently, they were going to a movie...

983
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,840
- What the fuck?
- Why are you here?

984
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,475
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

985
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,451
- I'm helping Noreen!
- Why are you helping?

986
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,522
- Dave.
- Son. Jesus.

987
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,625
<i>Here's something that...</i>

988
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,667
<i>if you want your father to think</i>
<i>you're not a silly fuck...</i>

989
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,670
<i>don't slap a guy across the face</i>
<i>with a glove.</i>

990
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,104
<i>Because if you do that,</i>
<i>that's what he will think...</i>

991
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,938
<i>unless you're a nobleman or something</i>
<i>in the 19th century...</i>

992
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,535
<i>which I'm not.</i>

993
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,149
- You can get inside okay, Dad?
- Yeah.

994
01:08:09,147 --> 01:08:11,672

<i>I order a chink call-girl...</i>

- What's up?

1009
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:42,264
Hey, what's the Nipper?

1010

- What's that?
- What's the Nipper this week?

You don't know yet?

Come on, man.

1014
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:51,473
What? I just asked you
about the Nipper.

1015
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:54,552
Monday, okay? That's the... Okay?

1016
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:59,055
- What's your problem?
- It's February, man. It's cold.

1017
01:10:00,425 --> 01:10:01,619
Fuck!

1018
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:04,796
- Fuck you, then.
- Fuck you!

1019
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:06,857
Do you know what variance is?

1020
01:10:06,965 --> 01:10:09,263
You think you could pick out a day...

1021
01:10:09,368 --> 01:10:12,303
a week ahead and give a realistic...
You know?

1022

God! Fuck!

01:10:25,817 --> 01:10:27,114

I have to go see my kids!

You put fucking pie shit on my coat!

1027
01:10:33,158 --> 01:10:36,218
I have to see my kids

01:10:56,915 --> 01:10:59,440
- Hello?
<i>- Hello? Dave?</i>

1033
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:03,184
- What?
<i>- It's Mark Dersen from</i> Hello America.

1034
01:11:05,323 --> 01:11:06,551
Hi, Dave.

1035
01:11:18,537 --> 01:11:20,061
- Take care.
- Okay.

1036
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:23,033
Noreen.

1037
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:24,839
- Hi.
- Hi.

1038
01:11:27,512 --> 01:11:28,877
Shelly looks nice.

1039
01:11:30,315 --> 01:11:31,646
We bought that in New York.

1040
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,911
Yeah, I know. That's why I said it.

1041
01:11:34,019 --> 01:11:35,486
It's very nice.

1042
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:41,716
Noreen, I got offered the show.
<i>Hello America</i> with Bryant Gumbel.

1043
01:11:43,028 --> 01:11:44,586
Well, that's great.

1044
01:11:46,631 --> 01:11:50,499
- Are you gonna take it?
- I'm thinking about it.

1045
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:54,933
It's a pretty substantial salary,
and you know the venue. It's big.

1046
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,600
It's a pretty big salary jump, I guess.

1047
01:11:59,644 --> 01:12:02,374
$1.2 million all in, Noreen.

1048
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:07,018
Can we think about that?

1049
01:12:07,586 --> 01:12:08,746
What?

1050
01:12:10,655 --> 01:12:14,455
What that kind of change
could be like for everybody.

1051
01:12:14,893 --> 01:12:16,918
Mike, Shelly, you know?

1052
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:22,594
If we thought about trying again.

1053
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:29,265
Dave, I'm marrying Russ.

1054
01:14:19,284 --> 01:14:22,048
<i>Accuracy equals focusing on a point.</i>

1055
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:26,857
<i>Gravity pulls an inch a yard.</i>

1056
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,592
<i>You point up.</i>

1057
01:14:33,732 --> 01:14:34,797
<i>But you have to factor in wind...</i>

1058
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:35,862
<i>But you have to factor in wind...</i>

1059
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:38,265
<i>which is the most difficult part.</i>

1060
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:47,041
Noreen.

1061
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:56,519
<i>I had to go in anyway.</i>

1062
01:14:57,255 --> 01:14:59,223
<i>It was time for my speech.</i>

1063
01:15:06,831 --> 01:15:09,356
<i>And that's what I know</i>
<i>about Robert Spritzel.</i>

1064
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:14,234
<i>Forbearance, charity, wisdom.</i>

1065
01:15:16,274 --> 01:15:18,242
<i>There are too few like him.</i>

1066
01:15:18,877 --> 01:15:21,175
<i>And now Robert's son, David.</i>

1067
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:36,591
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

1068
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:43,233
<i>Many of you came</i>
<i>from long distances...</i>

1069
01:15:44,135 --> 01:15:47,798
<i>and I know I speak for my mom</i>
<i>and Noreen...</i>

1070
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:51,839
<i>and my family, Mike and Shelly,</i>
<i>when I say thank you.</i>

1071
01:15:56,181 --> 01:16:00,447
<i>When I think of my dad,</i>
<i>I think of Bob Seger's</i> Like a Rock.

1072
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,158
<i>And then the power went out.</i>

1073
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,797
<i>Then, when the lights came back on</i>
<i>in 40 minutes...</i>

1074
01:16:23,074 --> 01:16:26,532
<i>everyone had pretty much forgotten</i>
<i>that I was talking...</i>

1075
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:31,112
<i>and we never finished</i>
<i>that part of the thing.</i>

1076
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:34,979
<i>So my speech was,</i>
<i>"When I think of my dad...</i>

1077
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:37,577
<i>"I think of Bob Seger's</i> Like a Rock."

1078
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:41,791
<i>That's all I said</i>
<i>at my dad's living funeral...</i>

1079
01:16:42,427 --> 01:16:44,418
<i>something about Bob Seger.</i>

1080
01:17:03,448 --> 01:17:07,179
<i>You've reached 272-7638.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1081
01:17:08,553 --> 01:17:12,216
<i>Dave, it's Mark Dersen</i>
<i>from</i> Hello America.

1082
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:16,258
<i>Can you give me a call back?</i>
<i>I called a couple of times Friday...</i>

1083
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:19,524
<i>and I'm wondering</i>
<i>why you haven't called me back.</i>

1084
01:17:19,831 --> 01:17:23,198
<i>If I need to move down on my list,</i>
<i>look, I need to know. Okay?</i>

1085
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:26,532
<i>It's not "Hello, you know,</i>
<i>whatever, Orlando."</i>

1086
01:17:27,005 --> 01:17:29,633
<i>Look. I'm still jacked about you, Dave.</i>

1087
01:17:29,741 --> 01:17:32,301
<i>I just need to hear from you.</i>
<i>Give me a call.</i>

1088
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,249
Your phone's ringing.

1089
01:17:46,224 --> 01:17:47,418
I know.

1090
01:17:51,162 --> 01:17:53,130
Why aren't you getting it?

1091
01:17:54,866 --> 01:17:57,130
It's the Bryant Gumbel thing.

1092
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,597
So why aren't you getting it?

1093
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:03,841
Did you bring that stuff?

1094
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:05,876
It's by the door.

1095
01:18:14,052 --> 01:18:15,713
You should get it.

1096
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:28,390
<i>Fuck.</i>

1097
01:18:30,068 --> 01:18:32,559
<i>It was a McDonald's hot apple pie.</i>

1098
01:18:33,037 --> 01:18:34,504
<i>They're not kidding.</i>

1099
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:36,503
<i>It was hot.</i>

1100
01:19:01,132 --> 01:19:03,726
<i>The other thing that gets to people...</i>

1101
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:06,298
<i>that leads to pies, I guess...</i>

1102
01:19:06,804 --> 01:19:09,102
<i>are these catch phrases</i>
<i>we're required to use...</i>

1103
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:11,334
<i>to single the program out.</i>

1104
01:19:12,043 --> 01:19:14,011
<i>It gets under people's skin.</i>

1105
01:19:14,112 --> 01:19:15,272
<i>Spritz Nipper.</i>

1106
01:19:20,852 --> 01:19:22,820
<i>But the whole thing about all of it...</i>

1107
01:19:22,921 --> 01:19:24,946
<i>all the getting hit with stuff...</i>

1108
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:28,420
<i>the whole thing is, who gets hit</i>
<i>with a fucking pie, anyway?</i>

1109
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:30,517
<i>Did anyone ever throw a pie</i>
<i>at Thomas Jefferson?</i>

1110
01:19:30,628 --> 01:19:32,755
<i>Or Buzz Aldrin? I doubt it.</i>

1111
01:19:32,864 --> 01:19:35,492
<i>But this is like the ninth time I got...</i>

1112
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:38,401
<i>Clowns get hit with pies.</i>

1113
01:19:52,617 --> 01:19:55,518
- Fuck!
- I'm Mike's father! Here's your shit!

1114
01:20:05,063 --> 01:20:07,327
I saw you buy this at the mall
on North Avenue!

1115
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:09,195
And I'm telling the cops, too!

1116
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,758
So you can cut your crap
about Mike jacking your wallet!

1117
01:20:17,775 --> 01:20:20,539
He's just a kid. See!

1118
01:20:21,012 --> 01:20:23,640
He looks grown, but he's just a kid!

1119
01:20:24,582 --> 01:20:27,050
You fucking asshole.

1120
01:20:31,789 --> 01:20:35,122
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I'll bet no one ever threw a pie at, like...</i>

1121
01:20:35,226 --> 01:20:38,753
<i>Harriet Tubman, the founder of</i>
<i>the Underground Railroad.</i>

1122
01:20:39,163 --> 01:20:41,825
<i>I'll bet you a million fucking dollars.</i>

1123
01:21:12,196 --> 01:21:14,960
<i>The first time I was struck</i>
<i>with something...</i>

1124
01:21:15,533 --> 01:21:18,001
<i>a chicken breast from Kenny Rogers...</i>

1125
01:21:18,503 --> 01:21:21,028
<i>I was standing next to a garbage pail.</i>

1126
01:21:22,006 --> 01:21:25,737
<i>I thought it might've been an accident,</i>
<i>that they were throwing it out.</i>

1127
01:21:25,843 --> 01:21:28,869
<i>The second time,</i>
<i>it hit me square on the chin...</i>

1128
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,547
<i>a soft taco.</i>

1129
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:32,475
<i>Then, pop.</i>

1130
01:21:33,418 --> 01:21:34,885
<i>A falafel.</i>

1131
01:21:36,254 --> 01:21:37,551
<i>McNuggets.</i>

1132
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,217
<i>Always fast food.</i>

1133
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,957
<i>Fast food.</i>

1134
01:21:45,163 --> 01:21:48,189
<i>Shit people would rather throw out</i>
<i>than finish.</i>

1135
01:21:48,499 --> 01:21:50,490
<i>It's easy. It tastes all right...</i>

1136
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:53,798
<i>but it doesn't really provide you</i>
<i>any nourishment.</i>

1137
01:21:55,907 --> 01:21:57,431
<i>I'm fast food.</i>

1138
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:00,067
Hey.

1139
01:22:00,912 --> 01:22:01,936
Hey.

1140
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:08,351
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

1141
01:22:10,655 --> 01:22:14,091
Am I gonna get in trouble?
I didn't do anything.

1142
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:19,158
You're not in trouble. I took care of it.

1143
01:22:21,099 --> 01:22:22,396
I got on him.

1144
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:25,892
I let him know
we're not messing around.

1145
01:22:26,104 --> 01:22:27,401
I whaled on him.

1146
01:22:28,172 --> 01:22:29,230
What?

1147
01:22:29,974 --> 01:22:32,442
I caught him one clean one for sure,
on the forehead...

1148
01:22:32,543 --> 01:22:34,943
and then I fucking whaled on him.

1149
01:22:35,713 --> 01:22:37,044
Seriously?

1150
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:41,911
He's not going to say you stole anything,
and you're not in trouble.

1151
01:22:50,161 --> 01:22:52,994
- What are you eating?
- Corn dog.

1152
01:23:09,147 --> 01:23:11,274
You're a kid, Mike. Fuck.

1153
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:14,084
- I'm not a kid.
- You are a kid.

1154
01:23:14,185 --> 01:23:18,554
Don't put yourself in grown-up situations
again until you're a grown-up.

1155
01:23:19,056 --> 01:23:20,353
- Okay.
- Okay?

1156
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,550
Yeah.

1157
01:23:23,761 --> 01:23:26,696
- Do you want me to get you a corn dog?
- What? No.

1158
01:23:28,432 --> 01:23:29,797
What do you want?

1159
01:23:31,502 --> 01:23:32,696
Nothing.

1160
01:23:50,154 --> 01:23:51,451
Weatherman!

1161
01:24:00,097 --> 01:24:01,496
- Hey.
- Hi.

1162
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:05,934
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1163
01:24:07,538 --> 01:24:09,563
I just wanted you to...

1164
01:24:09,674 --> 01:24:10,663
What?

1165
01:24:13,144 --> 01:24:14,907
<i>I was eighteen</i>

1166
01:24:15,246 --> 01:24:16,907
<i>Didn't have a care</i>

1167
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:20,212
<i>Working for peanuts</i>

1168
01:24:20,885 --> 01:24:22,648
<i>Not a dime to spare</i>

1169
01:24:24,689 --> 01:24:28,625
<i>But I was lean and solid everywhere</i>

1170
01:24:29,193 --> 01:24:30,990
<i>Like a rock</i>

1171
01:24:33,898 --> 01:24:35,695
I don't really get it.

1172
01:24:36,834 --> 01:24:38,358
Am I following it?

1173
01:24:41,572 --> 01:24:45,406
It was just a lead up
to other things I wanted to say.

1174
01:24:46,444 --> 01:24:47,741
Here's the part.

1175
01:24:48,379 --> 01:24:50,040
<i>And I held firm</i>

1176
01:24:50,514 --> 01:24:52,379
<i>To what I felt was right</i>

1177
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,681
<i>Like a rock</i>

1178
01:24:55,419 --> 01:24:57,546
I wanted to talk about that part...

1179
01:24:57,922 --> 01:24:59,549
about you.

1180
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:01,922
That's like you.

1181
01:25:02,026 --> 01:25:04,221
<i>I was strong as I could be</i>

1182
01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:06,358
<i>Like a rock</i>

1183
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:10,800
I got the job.

1184
01:25:12,169 --> 01:25:13,466
New York?

1185
01:25:14,872 --> 01:25:17,898
That's terrific.
That's a remarkable income.

1186
01:25:18,509 --> 01:25:21,535
That's more money than I ever made,
that salary.

1187
01:25:22,179 --> 01:25:23,305
Yeah.

1188
01:25:23,814 --> 01:25:26,442
That's quite
an American accomplishment.

1189
01:25:27,184 --> 01:25:28,310
Thanks.

1190
01:25:31,889 --> 01:25:33,516
Are you okay?

1191
01:25:40,665 --> 01:25:42,530
I can't knuckle down.

1192
01:25:43,734 --> 01:25:44,996
Noreen's marrying Russ.

1193
01:25:45,102 --> 01:25:47,468
There's nothing
to knuckle down on, so...

1194
01:25:47,571 --> 01:25:50,039
I can't fucking knuckle down.

1195
01:25:53,678 --> 01:25:54,975
Your hand.

1196
01:25:58,215 --> 01:26:00,410
I just saw Mike's counselor.

1197
01:26:01,585 --> 01:26:05,282
Mike mentioned that you
were gonna fix this business up.

1198
01:26:07,124 --> 01:26:08,751
He's in no trouble?

1199
01:26:11,062 --> 01:26:12,461
Good job.

1200
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:20,635
Your hand okay?

1201
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:21,965
It's okay.

1202
01:26:22,406 --> 01:26:24,499
- You certain?
- Don't worry.

1203
01:26:25,776 --> 01:26:28,711
You always worry about your kids...

1204
01:26:29,847 --> 01:26:31,405
no matter how old.

1205
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:34,377
There's always looking after.

1206
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:48,191
I read your book.

1207
01:26:48,933 --> 01:26:49,991
Fuck.

1208
01:26:53,304 --> 01:26:57,070
I was going to do some more work on it,
then I chucked it.

1209
01:26:57,608 --> 01:26:59,872
- You chucked it.
- Garbage.

1210
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:06,846
It's just what I do, David.

1211
01:27:07,818 --> 01:27:10,116
I've practiced and I've gotten good.

1212
01:27:10,588 --> 01:27:13,022
Like you and the weather business.

1213
01:27:16,327 --> 01:27:17,919
But I don't predict it.

1214
01:27:18,029 --> 01:27:20,520
Nobody does, 'cause it's just wind.
It's wind.

1215
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:22,258
It blows all over the place!

1216
01:27:22,366 --> 01:27:23,890
What the fuck?

1217
01:27:31,976 --> 01:27:34,171
I have to go to work.

1218
01:27:34,512 --> 01:27:35,638
David.

1219
01:27:42,186 --> 01:27:44,154
This shit life...

1220
01:27:47,558 --> 01:27:49,685
we must chuck some things.

1221
01:27:55,132 --> 01:27:56,759
We must chuck them...

1222
01:27:58,302 --> 01:28:00,099
in this shit life.

1223
01:28:07,478 --> 01:28:09,446
There's always looking after.

1224
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:14,147
You have time.

1225
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,183
Thanks.

1226
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:23,812
<i>Pretty soon after Robert's living funeral,</i>
<i>we had his real one.</i>

1227
01:30:22,179 --> 01:30:24,147
I'm sorry for your loss.

1228
01:30:26,917 --> 01:30:29,317
That's a lovely thing to say to me.

1229
01:30:30,955 --> 01:30:32,513
Where'd you hear that?

1230
01:30:33,057 --> 01:30:34,422
His friends.

1231
01:30:42,366 --> 01:30:44,994
I'm glad one of you brought an umbrella.

1232
01:30:45,269 --> 01:30:48,102
I had a feeling
it was going to rain today.

1233
01:30:48,372 --> 01:30:50,306
You're not going to take my job,
are you?

1234
01:30:50,407 --> 01:30:54,571
No. I'm going to be a cameraman
for <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

1235
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:57,544
Is that okay?

1236
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:02,249
Yeah. That's good.

1237
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:09,958
There are a great many
of Robert's friends here, even in winter.

1238
01:31:10,527 --> 01:31:13,928
I think it's because Robert was unusual.

1239
01:31:14,031 --> 01:31:17,023
I think that's what
brought so many of you out.

1240
01:31:17,701 --> 01:31:21,467
A loving husband
and father for 40 years.

1241
01:31:21,572 --> 01:31:24,871
And a good friend to some of you
for longer.

1242
01:31:25,743 --> 01:31:30,009
I'm sure that's why
we appreciated and loved Robert.

1243
01:31:30,981 --> 01:31:32,642
He was excellent.

1244
01:31:33,384 --> 01:31:34,681
Selfless.

1245
01:31:35,653 --> 01:31:36,950
Resolute.

1246
01:31:37,921 --> 01:31:39,479
<i>I remember once...</i>

1247
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:44,557
<i>imagining what my life would be like,</i>
<i>what I'd be like.</i>

1248
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:48,764
<i>I pictured having all these qualities.</i>

1249
01:31:48,866 --> 01:31:51,835
<i>Strong, positive qualities...</i>

1250
01:31:51,935 --> 01:31:55,029
<i>that people could pick up on</i>
<i>from across a room.</i>

1251
01:31:58,075 --> 01:31:59,667
<i>But as time passed...</i>

1252
01:31:59,777 --> 01:32:02,712
<i>few ever became</i>
<i>any qualities I actually had.</i>

1253
01:32:05,182 --> 01:32:09,585
<i>And all the possibilities I faced,</i>
<i>and the sorts of people I could be...</i>

1254
01:32:09,687 --> 01:32:14,181
<i>all of them got reduced every year</i>
<i>to fewer and fewer...</i>

1255
01:32:14,758 --> 01:32:17,386
<i>until finally they got reduced to one...</i>

1256
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:19,660
<i>to who I am.</i>

1257
01:32:26,437 --> 01:32:28,132
<i>And that's who I am...</i>

1258
01:32:31,809 --> 01:32:33,470
<i>the weatherman.</i>

1259
01:33:26,163 --> 01:33:29,030
<i>But first Dave Spritz has the check</i>
<i>of our national weather. Dave.</i>

1260
01:33:29,133 --> 01:33:32,193
<i>Well, thanks, Bryant. Well, it feels like</i>
<i>spring if you're in the Northeast.</i>

1261
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:33,462
<i>Is it gonna last? Let's take a look.</i>

1262
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:36,437
<i>We've got a warm weather system</i>
<i>to thank for these high temperatures...</i>

1263
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,667
Mike, you ready for school?

1264
01:33:38,776 --> 01:33:39,902
Russ?

1265
01:33:40,644 --> 01:33:42,134
Let's go, guys.

1266
01:33:42,646 --> 01:33:43,772
Come on.

1267
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:46,883
You're gonna get it!

1268
01:33:47,117 --> 01:33:48,948
- Bye, Shelly.
- Bye, Mom.

1269
01:33:49,052 --> 01:33:51,714
<i>That's your national weather.</i>
<i>I'll be back with your local focus...</i>

1270
01:33:51,822 --> 01:33:53,483
<i>at the bottom of the hour.</i>

1271
01:34:13,877 --> 01:34:16,607
- Hey, are you Dave Spritz?
- Yeah.

1272
01:34:17,314 --> 01:34:19,612
- Can I get your autograph?
- Sure.

1273
01:34:23,987 --> 01:34:26,182
So is it going to rain today?

1274
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:29,255
Who knows?

1275
01:34:34,398 --> 01:34:35,865
Hey, <i>Hello America.</i>

1276
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:39,500
<i>I've been doing the show</i>
<i>for a few months.</i>

1277
01:34:39,603 --> 01:34:42,265
<i>People don't throw things</i>
<i>at me anymore...</i>

1278
01:34:42,573 --> 01:34:45,041
<i>maybe because I carry a bow around.</i>

1279
01:34:45,209 --> 01:34:46,506
<i>I don't know.</i>

1280
01:34:52,683 --> 01:34:54,275
<i>I go back to Chicago weekends...</i>

1281
01:34:54,384 --> 01:34:56,249
<i>keep it steady with Mike and Shelly...</i>

1282
01:34:56,353 --> 01:35:00,187
<i>come back, do the weather.</i>
<i>So... Forecast?</i>

1283
01:35:01,058 --> 01:35:02,286
<i>Come on.</i>

1284
01:35:02,526 --> 01:35:04,687
<i>Another man is with my family.</i>

1285
01:35:05,329 --> 01:35:08,321
<i>Things didn't work out</i>
<i>the way I predicted.</i>

1286
01:35:08,532 --> 01:35:10,659
<i>Accepting that's not easy...</i>

1287
01:35:11,835 --> 01:35:14,463
<i>but easy doesn't enter</i>
<i>into grown-up life.</i>

1288
01:35:17,574 --> 01:35:20,270
<i>I'll take this American accomplishment.</i>

1289
01:35:20,677 --> 01:35:22,338
<i>That's where I live...</i>

1290
01:35:22,446 --> 01:35:25,677
<i>behind Fire Brigade 47. Okay.</i>

1291
01:35:26,216 --> 01:35:28,184
<i>But in front of SpongeBob.</i>

1292
01:35:30,687 --> 01:35:32,211
<i>Hello, America.</i>
