1
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:16,542
<i>You will travel far, my little Kal-El.</i>

2
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:19,295
<i>But we will never leave you...</i>

3
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,381
<i>... even in the face of our deaths.</i>

4
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:26,177
<i>You will make my strength your own.</i>

5
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,806
<i>You will see my life through your eyes...</i>

6
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:34,518
<i>... as your life will be seen through mine.</i>

7
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:42,026
<i>The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.</i>

8
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,151
<i>In spite of your past...</i>

9
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:15,114
...I know you're a good man.

10
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,409
And all good men...

11
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,454
...deserve a second chance.

12
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:32,590
From the moment
I received your first letter...

13
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:35,593
...I knew you were not like the rest.

14
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,057
You came from nothing...

15
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,518
...and you worked so hard
to get where you are.

16
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,314
You might have made a few mistakes.

17
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:51,484
- Gertrude, for God's sake!
- Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now!

18
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:57,281
You said that if I helped you
get out of prison...

19
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,952
...you'd take care of me.

20
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,121
And you have.

21
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:09,710
You've shown me pleasures
that I've never known.

22
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,631
That's why you deserve...

23
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:15,716
...everything.

24
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,680
I love you...

25
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,266
...Lex Luthor.

26
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,993
Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook.

27
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,203
He doesn't love you, Gertrude!

28
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,746
He's a monster! Gertrude!

29
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,600
- You can keep that.
- Oh, God.

30
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,059
The rest is mine.

31
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,192
We're done.

32
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,891
Bye, Martha.

33
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,800
Oh, Clark.

34
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:31,556
Oh, my boy.

35
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:22,273
Will you get that thing out of my face!

36
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,948
Lex, your friends give me the creeps.

37
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:32,992
Prison is a creepy place, Kitty.

38
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,620
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

39
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:38,289
Even a man with my vast talents
is worth less inside...

40
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:42,335
...than a carton of cigarettes and
a sharp piece of metal in your pocket.

41
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,175
Do you know the story of Prometheus?
No, of course you don't.

42
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:53,387
Prometheus was a god who stole
the power of fire from the other gods...

43
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,306
...and gave control of it to mortals.

44
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,142
In essence, he gave us technology.
He gave us power.

45
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,854
So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic.

46
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,650
Actually, sort of. You see, whoever
controls technology controls the world.

47
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,486
The Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads.

48
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:11,614
The British Empire ruled the world
because they built ships.

49
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:15,284
America, the atom bomb,
and so on and so forth.

50
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,119
I just want what Prometheus wanted.

51
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:21,123
Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god.

52
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:27,213
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes...

53
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,674
...and don't share their power
with mankind.

54
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,467
Hey, boss.

55
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,719
We found something.

56
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,352
No, I don't wanna be a god.

57
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,605
I just wanna bring fire to the people.

58
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,360
And I want my cut.

59
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,405
Was this his house?

60
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,783
You might think so. Most would.

61
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,995
This is more of a monument
to a long dead...

62
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,748
...and extremely powerful civilization.

63
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:46,584
This is where he learned who he was.

64
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,754
This is where he came for guidance.

65
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,725
Possibilities.

66
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:06,979
Endless possibilities.

67
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,944
You act like you've been here before.

68
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,847
<i>My son...</i>

69
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,768
<i>... you do not remember me.</i>

70
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,855
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

71
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,357
<i>I'm your father.</i>

72
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:37,612
<i>By now, I will have been dead
many thousands of your years.</i>

73
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:41,282
<i>- He thinks I'm his son.
- You are the only survivor of Krypton.</i>

74
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:47,121
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...</i>

75
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:50,166
<i>... and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...</i>

76
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,753
<i>... spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

77
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,714
<i>There are questions to be asked.</i>

78
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,008
<i>Here in this...</i>

79
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:01,677
<i>This Fortress of Solitude...</i>

80
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,723
<i>... we shall try to find
the answers together.</i>

81
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,391
Can he see us?

82
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,769
No, he's dead.

83
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:12,313
<i>So, my son...</i>

84
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,735
<i>... Kal-El...</i>

85
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:23,282
<i>... speak.</i>

86
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,911
Tell me everything...

87
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:29,705
...starting with crystals.

88
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,009
Hey, boy.

89
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:56,120
<i>- On Tuesday, between support...</i>

90
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,623
<i>- hindered the firefighting efforts
for all those...</i>

91
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:03,461
<i>Police have finally arrived and it's
still complete mayhem down here.</i>

92
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,215
<i>Fighting broke out in the
southernmost region...</i>

93
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,800
<i>... with border fire
and small-arms attacks prevalent.</i>

94
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,719
Don't worry, I buried it this morning.

95
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:14,972
<i>- It was futile trying to force him
to testify before a grand jury.</i>

96
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,641
Mom?

97
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,061
Five years.

98
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:25,358
If your father was alive,
he never would have let you go.

99
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,652
I almost gave up hope.

100
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:31,072
I just thought
I would never see you again.

101
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:34,408
Oh, Clark.

102
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,335
Did you find what you were looking for?

103
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:48,881
I thought, hoped...

104
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,509
...it might still be there.

105
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,011
Your home?

106
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:58,849
That place was a graveyard.

107
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:01,769
I'm all that's left.

108
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:07,567
Clark, the universe is a big place.

109
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,361
And you don't know who's out there.

110
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,615
And even if you are the last...

111
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,036
...you're not alone.

112
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,459
I know.

113
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:48,232
- Sorry.
- Look out!

114
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:49,650
Watch out, will you?

115
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,319
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

116
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:54,238
Sorry.

117
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,743
Great. Would you be careful?

118
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:03,247
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent!

119
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:05,499
Welcome back! Oh, my God!

120
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:09,420
Hey, come... Wait right there.
I'll be right back.

121
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:22,350
Oh, hey, sorry, guys,
I'm still looking for a place to live...

122
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:24,268
...if you know of anything reasonable.

123
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:28,105
Behind you, Mr. Kent.
I made it myself. It's a cake.

124
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,484
Oh, it looks...

125
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:33,736
...delicious.

126
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:38,241
Olsen! Where are the photos
of that birthday-clown-massacre thing?

127
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:40,993
I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back.

128
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,787
- Kent?
- Hey, chief.

129
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:45,456
- Thank you for giving me my job back.
- Don't thank me.

130
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:46,958
Thank Norm Palmer for dying.

131
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,795
It was his time.

132
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:55,675
- Let's get you set up, huh?
- Olsen!

133
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,093
Okay, so I gotta run...

134
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,555
...but I will be back to check on you
in a sec, Mr. Kent.

135
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:04,892
Oh, hey, do you know
where I can find Lois?

136
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:21,200
<i>The timing of this
automated-ignition countdown...</i>

137
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,536
<i>... is the most precarious part
of the launch.</i>

138
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:25,329
<i>Lois Lane, Daily Planet.</i>

139
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:28,749
<i>You also stated that the shuttle
will usher in a new era of travel...</i>

140
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,961
<i>... enabling the average person
to afford transcontinental flights.</i>

141
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,213
<i>But can you tell us the exact price...</i>

142
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,966
<i>... an "average person"
will be expected to pay?</i>

143
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,844
<i>The answer to that question
is in your press packet.</i>

144
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:42,763
<i>The Earth is surrounded
by a blanket of air...</i>

145
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,308
<i>... which we call the atmosphere.</i>

146
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:49,061
<i>It reaches over...</i>

147
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,902
Yeah. He looks just like his mom.

148
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:42,073
Already takes after her too, especially
when it comes to getting into trouble.

149
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,741
Mother?

150
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:50,248
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you've been gone.
Fearless reporter Lois Lane is a mommy.

151
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,878
Oh, you know, I'll just...
I'll take that. That's good.

152
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,965
- Sorry.
- No. She's got plenty.

153
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,092
- Wait, she's married?
- Yes.

154
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:05,638
No. Not really. It's more like
a prolonged engagement.

155
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,266
But don't ask Miss Lane
when they're tying the knot...

156
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:11,978
...because she hates that question.

157
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:16,607
<i>- Like this follow the same stringent
safety guidelines set by NASA?</i>

158
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:19,402
<i>Since this is a joint venture
with the Air Force...</i>

159
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:23,072
You all right? You look like
you could use a drink.

160
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,744
This place is so tacky.
Why are we back here?

161
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:32,540
Kitty, while you were doing your nails
and ordering fur coats online...

162
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:34,458
...I was busy unlocking the secrets...

163
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,503
...of one of the most advanced
civilizations in the universe.

164
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,921
Weren't there two of those?

165
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:43,342
You see, unlike our clunky
earthbound forms of construction...

166
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,970
...the technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...

167
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:48,556
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

168
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:50,099
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

169
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:54,020
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

170
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,314
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

171
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,860
But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...

172
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:03,070
...entire continents...

173
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:06,157
...all grown.

174
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:17,168
To think that one could create
a new world...

175
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:20,338
...with such a simple little object.

176
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,342
It's like a seed.

177
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:26,761
And all it needs is water.

178
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:28,387
Like...

179
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,182
...Sea-Monkeys.

180
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,144
Exactly, Kitty.

181
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:37,355
Like Sea-Monkeys.

182
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:44,153
Clark has been doing a little
soul-searching for the last couple years.

183
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,322
- He saw llamas.
- Yeah?

184
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:48,532
- Yeah.
- Must be tough coming back.

185
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:52,411
- Coming back?
- To work.

186
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:54,789
Yeah.

187
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:57,792
Well, you know, things change.

188
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,002
I mean, of course things change...

189
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:06,050
...but sometimes things that you didn't
think would change could change.

190
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,094
Take Lois.

191
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:12,223
A woman like her,
I never thought she'd settle down.

192
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:16,352
You know, if you ask me...
Because she'll never tell you this...

193
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,399
...but if you ask me,
she's still in love with you-know-who.

194
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,619
The original space shuttle
generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust...

195
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,496
...just in the initial launch phase.

196
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:40,418
But, by piggybacking
on this Boeing 777... Yes?

197
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,628
If this launch is as pivotal as you claim...

198
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,089
...why is it being covered
by one news network?

199
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:48,467
Why don't we save those questions
for the post-launch briefing.

200
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,261
How about that, Miss Lane?

201
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:53,890
When we hit 40,000 feet,
the shuttle will detach, ascend...

202
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:57,768
...and then fire the first of two propellant
systems, the liquid fuel boosters.

203
00:27:57,935 --> 00:27:59,979
When the shuttle
reaches the stratosphere...

204
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,273
...the secondary
insertion booster will fire...

205
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,818
...propelling the craft
at 4gs into the mesosphere.

206
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,824
- Careful.
- I know.

207
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,661
- Careful. Careful.
- I know.

208
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:45,358
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

209
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,818
Wait for it.

210
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:53,991
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

211
00:28:56,452 --> 00:28:59,163
<i>It's freaking Gone With the Wind.</i>

212
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,874
- Shut off the camera.
- But I'm getting it.

213
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,085
I said, shut off the damn camera.

214
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,176
I think I did something wrong.

215
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:16,681
No. That wasn't you.

216
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,920
<i>Ignition is at T minus one minute
and we are prepping for separation.</i>

217
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,589
CDR, start the clock.

218
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:52,550
<i>Three minutes and counting.</i>

219
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:54,969
<i>Body signs normal. Crew is looking good.</i>

220
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:56,804
Shuttle readouts are holding steady.

221
00:29:56,971 --> 00:29:59,223
<i>- We're still a go for launch.
- Roger.</i>

222
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:09,609
<i>- Houston, you copy?
- Houston, do you copy?</i>

223
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:14,614
Oh, God.

224
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:17,825
<i>Electrical variance.</i>

225
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:23,164
What the...?

226
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:32,089
Please, there's nothing to worry about.

227
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:36,510
It seems that we are experiencing
a slight power outage.

228
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:43,935
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me. It just cycled back up.

229
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:47,146
<i>Genesis, radio check from Houston.</i>

230
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:51,275
There we have it.
We were experiencing a power outage.

231
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:56,280
<i>- Climbing to 40,000 feet.
- Roger, 40,000 feet.</i>

232
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,461
<i>And it's gone! A blazing fastball...</i>

233
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:33,150
Is that it?

234
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,701
I don't think so.

235
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,628
<i>Dual engine failure,
but they're up and running again.</i>

236
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:37,673
<i>Genesis, I hate to say this, but it looks
like we're gonna have to scrub the launch.</i>

237
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,385
- Aborting booster ignition.
- Roger. Aborting booster ignition.

238
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:46,349
Boosters are non-responsive.
We're still counting down for ignition.

239
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:48,226
<i>- Platform, we have a problem.
- Go.</i>

240
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:50,811
<i>Looks like something faulted
during the power outage.</i>

241
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:53,314
<i>Both boosters are
counting down for ignition.</i>

242
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:55,441
Platform, you have 30 seconds.

243
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:56,859
<i>- What?
- Release couplings.</i>

244
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:58,402
<i>We can't shut down boosters.</i>

245
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:02,031
We should be able to manage the launch
and recover to the emergency field.

246
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:03,741
<i>T minus 23 seconds to ignition.</i>

247
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:06,327
<i>Genesis, you're a go
for evac procedures.</i>

248
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:09,330
<i>Twenty-one, 20...</i>

249
00:33:09,497 --> 00:33:11,082
<i>... 19...</i>

250
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,753
Couplings are non-responsive.

251
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,838
<i>- We're still attached.
- Seventeen.</i>

252
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:21,968
<i>- Platform, couplings are jammed.
- Fifteen.</i>

253
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,928
<i>Fourteen.</i>

254
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:27,598
Don't be alarmed. It's absolutely normal.

255
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,436
<i>We're still attached.
Couplings are non-responsive.</i>

256
00:33:32,603 --> 00:33:35,189
<i>- Nine, eight...
- Houston, can you do a remote override?</i>

257
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,984
<i>... seven...</i>

258
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,820
<i>- Remote override is unresponsive.
- ... six, five...</i>

259
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:44,282
<i>- I repeat, remote override is unresponsive.
...four, three...</i>

260
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,621
And if you're lucky, you may hear
the faint pop of the sonic boom.

261
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:59,380
<i>- Houston, we have ignition.
- Roger, ignition.</i>

262
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:05,845
- This is Python 21, she's pulling away.
- Okay, all flight control is on the...

263
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:08,764
<i>This is not a drill.
Clear nonessential personnel.</i>

264
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:11,183
<i>Switch to emergency band frequencies.</i>

265
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:16,147
<i>Warning, warning.</i>

266
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:23,571
Oh, no! Oh, no!

267
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:25,823
Can I get a little help?

268
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:34,040
<i>This is UPV breaking news.
From Washington, Frank Jacobs.</i>

269
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,458
<i>We've just received word...</i>

270
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,377
<i>... that the inaugural flight
of the Genesis space shuttle...</i>

271
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,755
<i>... is experiencing a midair emergency.</i>

272
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:43,966
<i>- A problem with the launch
of the new orbital shuttle, Genesis.</i>

273
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:47,345
<i>The reports are telling us
the shuttle failed to disengage...</i>

274
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:50,431
<i>... sending both crafts
rocketing towards space.</i>

275
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:54,227
<i>We're now going live to Cape Canaveral
for the latest update on this story.</i>

276
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:55,728
<i>Jim, all we know right now...</i>

277
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:58,689
<i>... is that the couplings
which hold the shuttle to the 777...</i>

278
00:34:58,856 --> 00:35:01,025
<i>... malfunctioned
and did not release as planned.</i>

279
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:02,735
<i>- We're uncertain...
- I should do...</i>

280
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:05,529
<i>... why the ignition sequence
continued and boosters fired.</i>

281
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,574
<i>However, there's speculation here
that the blackout, which...</i>

282
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:26,759
Help me sit up.

283
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:33,724
<i>Mach one.
Still tied to the shuttle at 42,000 feet.</i>

284
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:37,562
- Houston, we need some help. Houston!
- Running diagnostics check. Stand by.

285
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:45,736
Insertion booster ignition in five seconds.

286
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,248
<i>Warning, warning.</i>

287
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,172
What the hell is that?

288
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,927
There's some kind of unidentified bogey
coming from the north.

289
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:12,263
<i>- Roger that.
- And it's coming in fast.</i>

290
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,681
Declaring an emergency.

291
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:03,643
<i>Overspeed, overspeed.</i>

292
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:12,818
<i>Altitude...</i>

293
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,337
Do you see that?

294
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:07,748
<i>Fly up, fly up.</i>

295
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,426
Is everyone all right?

296
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:33,691
Are you okay?

297
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:47,371
Well, I hope this experience
hasn't put any of you off flying.

298
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:50,541
Statistically speaking,
it's still the safest way to travel.

299
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:58,090
Superman! Superman! Superman!

300
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,017
Superman!

301
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:33,019
<i>Okay, everybody, listen up.</i>

302
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:34,812
I wanna know it all, everything.

303
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:39,025
Olsen, I wanna see photos of him
everywhere. No, I want the photos.

304
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,986
Sports, how are they gonna get
that plane out of the stadium?

305
00:42:42,153 --> 00:42:45,698
Travel, where did he go?
Was he on vacation? If so, where?

306
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:49,911
Gossip, has he met somebody?
Fashion, is that a new suit?

307
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:52,663
Health, has he gained weight?
What's he been eating?

308
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,417
Business, how is this gonna affect
the stock market? Long-term, short-term.

309
00:42:56,584 --> 00:43:01,339
Politics, does he still stand for truth,
justice, all that stuff? Lifestyle:

310
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:05,676
"Superman Returns."

311
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:11,432
Come on.

312
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:17,313
Gil, how many F's in "catastrophic"?

313
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,107
None. What's the usage?

314
00:43:20,274 --> 00:43:23,486
"This mysterious electromagnetic pulse
knocked out portable devices...

315
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:26,614
...and entire power grids,
causing a catastrophic event during..."

316
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:28,324
- Lois!
- Yes.

317
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:30,117
In my office.

318
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:33,371
This goes for everyone.

319
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:37,166
The story isn't the blackout,
it's Superman!

320
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:40,169
The story is the EMP, chief.

321
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:43,839
Every electronic device
on the East Coast goes dark.

322
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:46,133
- First, are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

323
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,303
Lois, three things sell papers:
Tragedy, sex and Superman.

324
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,057
People are sick of tragedy, we know
you can't write worth a damn about sex.

325
00:43:53,224 --> 00:43:56,811
<i>That means one thing. That one thing
is Superman. And you know it, Lois.</i>

326
00:43:57,353 --> 00:43:58,854
Lois?

327
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,732
<i>- Are you all right? You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

328
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:04,569
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thank God.</i>

329
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,405
<i>- Where's Jason?
- I don't know. Isn't he with you?</i>

330
00:44:07,572 --> 00:44:08,906
<i>- No.
- Well, where is he?</i>

331
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:10,658
Hi.

332
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:15,621
Hello.

333
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:23,004
Who are you?

334
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,341
I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of
your mom's from before you were born.

335
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:30,428
Really? She never mentioned you.

336
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:32,847
Really? Never?

337
00:44:33,014 --> 00:44:34,307
- No.
- Jason.

338
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:38,144
- What are you doing here, honey?
- Daddy's office is boring.

339
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:40,146
Daddy's office is boring?

340
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:42,982
Clark, hey! Welcome back.

341
00:44:46,277 --> 00:44:49,530
- I see you've already met the munchkin.
- Yeah, we were just talking...

342
00:44:49,697 --> 00:44:51,741
- Did you take vitamins? Eye drops?
- Yes. Yes.

343
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:54,118
- Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor?
- Yes. Yes, Mom.

344
00:44:54,285 --> 00:44:57,288
Good boy. He's a little fragile,
but he's gonna grow up...

345
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:59,790
...to be big and strong
like his dad, won't you?

346
00:44:59,957 --> 00:45:01,209
- Yes?
- Yes.

347
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,710
Oh, I saw you on the...

348
00:45:02,877 --> 00:45:04,921
Oh, yeah. That was nothing.

349
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:09,050
- Hey, can I borrow your stapler?
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:12,720
Thanks.

351
00:45:13,596 --> 00:45:17,475
Congratulations on the Pulitzer.
That's incredible.

352
00:45:17,642 --> 00:45:19,810
Yeah. Can you believe it? It's...

353
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:23,689
So I wanna hear all about your trip.

354
00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:26,525
Where did you go? What did you see?
Meet anyone special?

355
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:29,153
Well, there's so much. Where to begin?

356
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,822
Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo.

357
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,242
- How are you?
- Good.

358
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:36,494
Can you work some magic
to get your uncle...

359
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:39,288
...to stop giving me
such a hard time on this article?

360
00:45:39,872 --> 00:45:41,374
- Please?
- Again?

361
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:43,668
- Again.
- You got it.

362
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,921
- How are you, kiddo?
- Good.

363
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:48,881
Oh, this is Clark.

364
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:52,552
- Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark.
- Richard White.

365
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:53,970
Hi.

366
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:58,516
Richard's an assistant editor here who's
basically saved our International section.

367
00:45:58,683 --> 00:46:01,519
He's also a pilot
and he loves horror movies.

368
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:04,438
Clark is...

369
00:46:05,064 --> 00:46:07,024
Well, he's Clark.

370
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:11,070
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
I've heard so much.

371
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:14,198
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you.

372
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:16,701
- Gotta run.
- Where?

373
00:46:16,868 --> 00:46:21,122
You heard Perry. Superman's back, and
he thinks I'm the only one equipped to...

374
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:22,874
To what?

375
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,418
- I don't know, you know.
- So don't listen to him.

376
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:28,379
I'm not. Going to the power plant
to check out the blackout.

377
00:46:28,546 --> 00:46:29,922
Okay.

378
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:32,383
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

379
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:36,762
- Bye, Lois.
- And she's gone.

380
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,891
No matter how close we are,
that woman will always be a mystery.

381
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:43,561
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

382
00:46:43,728 --> 00:46:45,313
Nice to finally meet you.

383
00:46:45,479 --> 00:46:48,691
Where do you wanna go?
Wanna go to the park?

384
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:57,783
<i>And he's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

385
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,119
<i>He's got the whole world</i>

386
00:47:00,286 --> 00:47:02,872
<i>And he's got the whole world in his...</i>

387
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:06,709
Oh, he's cute.

388
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:27,146
Run into trouble?

389
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:29,565
- Should see the other guy.
- What are we gonna do?

390
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:31,400
Modify it, attach it to the stern.

391
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:33,444
I don't care if the instructions
are Russian.

392
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:03,558
- Lois?
- Hey, Clark.

393
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:05,476
How does it feel to be back at work?

394
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:09,897
Pretty good. You know,
kind of like riding a bike, I guess.

395
00:48:12,733 --> 00:48:15,653
- A bike?
- Yeah, you know...

396
00:48:16,028 --> 00:48:17,280
Never mind.

397
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:18,698
But I was wondering...

398
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:22,076
...since I've gotten back, we haven't
really had a chance to catch up.

399
00:48:22,243 --> 00:48:25,162
I thought maybe, if you'd like,
we could go grab some food...

400
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:27,456
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

401
00:48:27,623 --> 00:48:31,002
Have you ever met someone and it's like
you're from different worlds...

402
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:34,881
...but you shared such a connection you
knew you were destined to be together?

403
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:37,550
Then he just takes off
without explaining why...

404
00:48:37,717 --> 00:48:39,468
...or without even saying goodbye?

405
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:40,845
Sounds cheesy, I know.

406
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:44,682
- Well, maybe...
- Taxi!

407
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:47,685
...it was hard to say goodbye
because he had to go...

408
00:48:47,852 --> 00:48:51,230
...and he wanted to say goodbye,
but maybe it was too difficult for him.

409
00:48:51,397 --> 00:48:54,775
Difficult? What's so difficult about it?
"Goodbye." It's easy.

410
00:48:54,942 --> 00:48:57,612
What's so hard about saying goodbye?

411
00:48:57,778 --> 00:48:59,363
Who are we talking about?

412
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,366
Nobody, just forget I said anything.

413
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:04,535
Taxi! Hey!

414
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:06,996
Taxi!

415
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,544
Wow, thanks.

416
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:18,591
312 Riverside Drive, please.

417
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:21,260
Good night, Clark.

418
00:49:34,357 --> 00:49:36,150
Superman!

419
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:52,310
<i>I want egg rolls.</i>

420
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:56,647
<i>Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken
and snow peas for you.</i>

421
00:50:57,982 --> 00:50:59,901
<i>Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic?</i>

422
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:01,861
<i>Because he loves the peas...</i>

423
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:05,406
...and I think we all prefer egg rolls
over macrobiotic shakes.

424
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,117
It's a good point.

425
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:24,175
So I noticed you've been acting
a little different lately.

426
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:25,968
Have I?

427
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:32,475
You know, Lois,
that article that you wrote.

428
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:34,560
"Why the World
Doesn't Need Superman"?

429
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:38,606
No, no, no. No, the other one,
from years ago, before we met.

430
00:51:38,773 --> 00:51:42,318
Which article? I wrote dozens about him.
I was practically his press agent.

431
00:51:42,485 --> 00:51:44,403
"I Spent the Night With Superman."

432
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:50,493
Richard, come on.

433
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,620
It was the title of an interview.

434
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:54,789
Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea.

435
00:51:54,956 --> 00:51:58,000
- No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay.
- Richard.

436
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,628
It was a long time ago.

437
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:04,215
Were you in love with him?

438
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:10,221
He was Superman.
Everyone was in love with him.

439
00:52:11,514 --> 00:52:12,723
But were you?

440
00:52:21,649 --> 00:52:23,067
<i>No.</i>

441
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:25,403
<i>Lois, I shouldn't have brought it up.</i>

442
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,593
<i>Even though you've been
raised as a human being...</i>

443
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:50,845
<i>... you are not one of them.</i>

444
00:52:55,016 --> 00:52:58,269
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be.</i>

445
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:02,607
<i>They only lack the light
to show the way.</i>

446
00:53:03,024 --> 00:53:06,777
<i>For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...</i>

447
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:08,946
<i>... I have sent them you...</i>

448
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:11,073
<i>... my only son.</i>

449
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:26,691
Load them up.

450
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:55,428
Holy sh...

451
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:51,794
<i>Attention, the Metropolis
Museum of Natural History...</i>

452
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:54,672
<i>... will be closing in 10 minutes.
We hope that you've...</i>

453
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:56,716
Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes.

454
00:56:56,883 --> 00:56:58,593
We only need five.

455
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:48,768
You're done, the museum's closed.
Thank you.

456
00:59:09,891 --> 00:59:11,142
Are you all right, miss?

457
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:13,978
- My heart. I... I...
- I'm sorry?

458
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:19,442
I have a palpitation,
a heart palpitation. And a murmur.

459
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:22,987
Please, take me to the hospital.

460
00:59:23,988 --> 00:59:26,199
Take me to the hospital.

461
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:38,836
Just hold on tight.

462
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:17,583
Bingo.

463
01:00:45,194 --> 01:00:46,654
- There you are, ma'am.
- My heart.

464
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:50,700
My palpitations, they're gone.
What did you do?

465
01:00:50,867 --> 01:00:52,451
I didn't do anything.

466
01:00:52,618 --> 01:00:54,871
Call me Katherine.

467
01:00:55,037 --> 01:00:58,207
Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better.

468
01:00:58,374 --> 01:01:02,336
- You have places to go, people to save?
- Yes.

469
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:08,134
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime?

470
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:10,845
- I know that's forward. Or a drink?
- Good night.

471
01:01:11,012 --> 01:01:12,680
Good night.

472
01:01:31,532 --> 01:01:33,159
It's like this on every channel.

473
01:01:33,326 --> 01:01:36,204
<i>He was in Manila at 10:55 p.m.
And then spotted...</i>

474
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:40,124
- Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you.
- Oh, thanks.

475
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:44,253
<i>But as this security footage
from a simple deli robbery proves...</i>

476
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,548
<i>... there's really no feat too big
or too small for the Man of Steel.</i>

477
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:50,968
<i>Reports are flooding in from Metropolis,
Houston, Gotham and as far...</i>

478
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:53,888
<i>Satellites have proven
most ineffective at tracking him.</i>

479
01:01:54,055 --> 01:01:57,600
<i>He might literally be moving
near the speed of light.</i>

480
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:13,699
<i>- Our map is illuminated with sightings...
- Kent!</i>

481
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:16,911
<i>- The chief is waiting.
- ... on every continent, giving citizens...</i>

482
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:24,502
These are iconic, and they were taken
by a 12-year-old with a camera phone.

483
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:27,838
- What do you got, Olsen?
- I got those.

484
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:31,842
- Look, in the sky, chief.
- It's a bird.

485
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:33,594
- It's a plane.
- No, look, it's...

486
01:02:34,345 --> 01:02:35,555
You wanted to see me?

487
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:38,182
Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down.

488
01:02:38,349 --> 01:02:41,352
I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay.

489
01:02:41,852 --> 01:02:44,522
First off, Lois, I don't understand
what you're doing...

490
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:47,984
...sneaking around covering the blackout.
- It wasn't just a blackout.

491
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,152
Cell phones, pagers,
automobiles, airplane...

492
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,780
Every other paper in town
has got a female reporter...

493
01:02:52,947 --> 01:02:56,367
...a good-looking female reporter,
stashed on the roof covering Superman.

494
01:02:56,534 --> 01:03:00,204
- And you two are the ones with history.
- Chief, I've done Superman.

495
01:03:01,873 --> 01:03:03,916
Covered him. You know what I mean.

496
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,252
Yeah, that makes you an expert.
Do him again.

497
01:03:06,419 --> 01:03:09,213
- There are a dozen other stories out there.
- Yeah? Name one.

498
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,966
Well, there was a museum robbery
last night.

499
01:03:12,466 --> 01:03:15,928
Even Superman missed that one.
He was too busy saving this hooker.

500
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:18,764
Why don't you guys
track down Lex Luthor?

501
01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:21,726
Well, no one's seen him
since his fifth appeal.

502
01:03:21,893 --> 01:03:24,061
He's got more history
with Superman than anyone.

503
01:03:24,228 --> 01:03:25,730
Maybe he's got something to say.

504
01:03:25,897 --> 01:03:29,650
- Luthor's yesterday's news.
- No, I like that idea.

505
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:35,156
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
who nearly killed him, for God's sakes.

506
01:03:35,323 --> 01:03:37,575
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of prison?

507
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:41,746
Well, the appeals court called Superman
as a witness and he wasn't around.

508
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:44,582
How much do you think
that pisses off Superman?

509
01:03:44,749 --> 01:03:46,375
- Give him to someone else.
- A lot.

510
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,461
- A lot.
- Polly. Give him to Polly.

511
01:03:53,591 --> 01:03:55,134
Lois, Superman.

512
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:57,511
- What about the blackout?
- Kent, blackout.

513
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:02,433
Great. Thanks, chief.

514
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:10,399
Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this
damaged our relationship.

515
01:04:11,734 --> 01:04:12,860
Relationship?

516
01:04:13,611 --> 01:04:15,029
- Yeah.
- Hi, Mommy.

517
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:17,073
- Hi, you.
- Hey, guys.

518
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:21,035
He got an A in science, but a D in gym,
so we're doing something right.

519
01:04:21,202 --> 01:04:23,204
- Yeah, at least one of us is.
- What?

520
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:26,207
It's Perry. He just shoved Superman
back into my life.

521
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:29,335
Well, honey, I'm sure you can
find a way to interview Superman...

522
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:31,504
...without bringing him
back into your life.

523
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:35,967
<i>There's really no way around it, folks.
Superman is back in all of our lives.</i>

524
01:04:37,426 --> 01:04:39,220
<i>We're coming to you from Sydney...</i>

525
01:04:39,387 --> 01:04:43,182
<i>... where people have gathered
on these rooftops to scour the sky...</i>

526
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:46,561
Okay, how about this?
We'll stay late. We'll get dinner.

527
01:04:46,727 --> 01:04:50,356
I'll help with Superman, and you and
Clark can work on the blackout together.

528
01:04:50,523 --> 01:04:53,484
- Is that all right with you, Clark?
- Swell.

529
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:21,429
I was gonna pretend
the brakes were out.

530
01:05:21,596 --> 01:05:24,724
Pretend. Like we talked about.

531
01:05:24,891 --> 01:05:27,685
You didn't actually have to cut them!

532
01:05:27,852 --> 01:05:29,145
Of course I did.

533
01:05:29,312 --> 01:05:34,150
A man can always tell when a woman
is pretending, especially Superman.

534
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,407
So did you get your rock?

535
01:05:42,783 --> 01:05:44,702
I did.

536
01:05:46,078 --> 01:05:50,124
<i>U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft
advisory for the Metropolis ocean area.</i>

537
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:52,126
<i>High-wind advisory is in effect...</i>

538
01:05:52,293 --> 01:05:55,171
<i>... ocean currents and tides
becoming increasingly dangerous.</i>

539
01:05:55,338 --> 01:05:58,549
<i>All warnings lasting
until later this evening.</i>

540
01:05:58,716 --> 01:05:59,967
<i>Security, security.</i>

541
01:06:00,134 --> 01:06:05,598
<i>This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing
a small-craft advisory for northeast seas.</i>

542
01:06:05,765 --> 01:06:10,228
<i>Winds reaching 50 miles per hour,
high tides in the morning.</i>

543
01:06:10,394 --> 01:06:12,230
<i>Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet.</i>

544
01:06:12,396 --> 01:06:16,400
<i>This warning is in effect for
all small crafts for the next four hours.</i>

545
01:06:40,508 --> 01:06:42,134
Weird. If these times are right...

546
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:45,388
...the blackout spread
from a specific origin point.

547
01:06:45,555 --> 01:06:46,931
Where?

548
01:06:47,098 --> 01:06:48,891
I'm not sure yet.

549
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,271
With the super-hearing, does he hear each
sound by itself or everything at once?

550
01:06:53,646 --> 01:06:54,897
<i>Both.</i>

551
01:06:55,064 --> 01:06:57,275
<i>- He's certainly taller than I thought.
- 6'4".</i>

552
01:06:57,441 --> 01:07:01,195
I love that he can see through anything.
I'd have fun with that.

553
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:03,281
<i>Anything but lead.</i>

554
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:07,785
- I bet he's...
- 225 pounds...

555
01:07:07,952 --> 01:07:09,620
...faster than a speeding bullet...

556
01:07:09,787 --> 01:07:13,249
...draws his power from the sun,
invulnerable to anything but kryptonite...

557
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:15,459
...and he never lies.
- Kryptonite?

558
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:17,962
Radioactive pieces of his home world.

559
01:07:18,129 --> 01:07:20,339
It's deadly. To him.

560
01:07:24,927 --> 01:07:28,306
Lois, how tall would you say Clark is?

561
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:31,851
<i>About 6'3", 6'4".</i>

562
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:34,812
<i>About 200, 215 pounds?</i>

563
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,784
Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid
reporters something to keep them going.

564
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:50,828
- Burritos!
- Come here, canhead.

565
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:56,292
We're going this way. Do they have
anything other than burritos?

566
01:07:57,168 --> 01:07:59,503
I think they have fries and burgers.

567
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:02,173
So have you found a place to live yet?

568
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,925
No. I'm still looking.

569
01:08:04,675 --> 01:08:07,178
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

570
01:08:07,345 --> 01:08:10,848
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

571
01:08:24,612 --> 01:08:26,322
Thanks.

572
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:36,874
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

573
01:09:30,386 --> 01:09:33,139
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

574
01:09:36,434 --> 01:09:38,936
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

575
01:09:41,063 --> 01:09:44,192
I just wasn't expecting you.

576
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:46,444
With all the press on the plane...

577
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:49,030
...I wasn't sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

578
01:09:49,197 --> 01:09:52,366
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

579
01:09:54,577 --> 01:09:57,038
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

580
01:09:57,413 --> 01:10:00,958
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

581
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:05,963
So you're here for an interview?

582
01:10:07,215 --> 01:10:08,257
Okay, then.

583
01:10:12,136 --> 01:10:14,138
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

584
01:10:20,269 --> 01:10:22,980
Let's start with the big question.

585
01:10:23,147 --> 01:10:25,650
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

586
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:28,194
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

587
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:29,820
It was.

588
01:10:29,987 --> 01:10:32,365
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

589
01:10:33,824 --> 01:10:36,202
...I had to see for myself.

590
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:43,668
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

591
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:48,339
Not everyone.

592
01:10:49,507 --> 01:10:51,926
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

593
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:55,054
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

594
01:10:56,722 --> 01:10:58,766
How could you leave us like that?

595
01:11:00,268 --> 01:11:02,687
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

596
01:11:03,187 --> 01:11:04,689
That's why I wrote it.

597
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:07,650
The world doesn't need a savior.

598
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:09,986
And neither do I.

599
01:11:25,126 --> 01:11:26,210
Lois.

600
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,381
Will you come with me?

601
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:33,718
Why?

602
01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:36,220
There's something I wanna show you.

603
01:11:42,476 --> 01:11:44,270
Please.

604
01:11:55,281 --> 01:11:57,450
I can't be gone long.

605
01:11:57,617 --> 01:11:59,535
You won't be.

606
01:12:11,923 --> 01:12:14,675
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

607
01:12:14,842 --> 01:12:17,136
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

608
01:12:17,303 --> 01:12:19,931
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

609
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:23,684
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

610
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:26,896
Maybe Clark's right.

611
01:12:30,274 --> 01:12:32,401
You know, my...

612
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:37,615
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

613
01:12:38,783 --> 01:12:40,785
Not like this.

614
01:12:55,633 --> 01:12:58,052
I forgot how warm you were.

615
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:30,167
Listen.

616
01:13:31,043 --> 01:13:32,962
What do you hear?

617
01:13:33,671 --> 01:13:34,922
Nothing.

618
01:13:38,843 --> 01:13:40,595
I hear everything.

619
01:13:44,056 --> 01:13:46,684
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

620
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:51,355
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

621
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:06,871
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

622
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,793
I'll take you back now.

623
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:27,553
Richard's a good man.

624
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:33,184
And you've been gone a long time.

625
01:16:35,853 --> 01:16:37,438
I know.

626
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:43,528
I...

627
01:16:48,741 --> 01:16:50,743
So will I see you around?

628
01:16:51,744 --> 01:16:53,746
I'm always around.

629
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:56,749
Good night, Lois.

630
01:17:15,726 --> 01:17:19,605
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

631
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,986
You all right?

632
01:17:26,821 --> 01:17:28,239
Where have you been?

633
01:17:32,577 --> 01:17:38,249
I was up on the roof, getting some air.

634
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,877
Tell the truth now.

635
01:17:47,425 --> 01:17:48,593
Were you smoking?

636
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,972
No.

637
01:18:01,772 --> 01:18:02,982
Is this real?

638
01:18:04,025 --> 01:18:05,902
- Where'd you find him?
- He found me.

639
01:18:06,068 --> 01:18:08,863
Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it.

640
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:11,449
So, Mr. White, about the blackout...

641
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:14,118
Lois, this is the biggest night
of your life.

642
01:18:14,285 --> 01:18:16,454
Have you picked out a dress?
Something snazzy?

643
01:18:17,455 --> 01:18:20,166
It just feels a little weird
winning for that article.

644
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:23,377
- It just doesn't seem right.
- What doesn't seem right?

645
01:18:23,544 --> 01:18:27,131
Winning an award for an article called
"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."

646
01:18:27,298 --> 01:18:29,759
When, according
to this newspaper, they do.

647
01:18:29,926 --> 01:18:32,845
Lois, Pulitzer Prizes
are like Academy Awards.

648
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:36,140
Nobody remembers what you got one for.
It's just that you got one.

649
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:39,435
- But...
- This is your night. You enjoy it.

650
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:42,146
I'm sure Kent's on the blackout.

651
01:19:42,707 --> 01:19:44,917
Department of Water and Power, please.

652
01:19:45,626 --> 01:19:46,919
7782, great.

653
01:19:48,379 --> 01:19:49,881
Metropolis Public Works.

654
01:19:50,047 --> 01:19:52,550
<i>Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane
from the Daily Planet. Blackout?</i>

655
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:55,428
I just need a little info
on a few outstanding power grids.

656
01:19:55,595 --> 01:19:57,221
<i>Yeah, I do have it here, actually.</i>

657
01:19:57,388 --> 01:20:01,392
<i>So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36
and midtown 10 seconds before.</i>

658
01:20:01,559 --> 01:20:03,060
Which grid was hit first?

659
01:20:03,227 --> 01:20:04,562
<i>It just reads Vanderworth.</i>

660
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:07,106
<i>- Across the river?
- 6 Springwood Drive.</i>

661
01:20:07,273 --> 01:20:09,525
6 Springwood Drive.
A residence or a business?

662
01:20:09,692 --> 01:20:11,444
<i>- Residence.
- Sure? Nothing before that?</i>

663
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:13,946
<i>- That's all it shows.
- Thank you very much.</i>

664
01:20:15,781 --> 01:20:17,074
Oh, Jason.

665
01:20:23,873 --> 01:20:27,084
- There's your mom, Jason.
- You're late, Mommy.

666
01:20:35,301 --> 01:20:38,137
Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer?

667
01:20:38,304 --> 01:20:42,600
Nope. I've just gotta ask these people
a few questions and then we can go.

668
01:20:56,906 --> 01:20:59,283
Can I stay in the car?

669
01:20:59,825 --> 01:21:01,410
No, honey.

670
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:12,463
- Are we trespassing?
- No. Yes.

671
01:21:27,186 --> 01:21:29,021
Hello?

672
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:02,054
Hello?

673
01:22:13,149 --> 01:22:15,735
I like the curly one.

674
01:22:23,034 --> 01:22:25,870
Let's go. This was a bad idea.

675
01:22:41,594 --> 01:22:43,387
Lex Luthor.

676
01:22:45,389 --> 01:22:47,517
Lois Lane?

677
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:54,649
You're bald.

678
01:23:14,752 --> 01:23:16,128
And what is your name?

679
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:18,756
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

680
01:23:19,257 --> 01:23:21,217
- Cute kid, and smart.
- Thanks.

681
01:23:21,384 --> 01:23:24,595
We're not really strangers, are we?
This is kind of a little reunion.

682
01:23:24,762 --> 01:23:26,806
Heck, I'm a fan.

683
01:23:26,973 --> 01:23:28,474
I love your writing...

684
01:23:29,308 --> 01:23:31,143
...and your dress.
- I love your boat.

685
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:33,938
How'd you get it?
Swindle some widow out of her money?

686
01:23:35,273 --> 01:23:37,525
That's funny. Didn't you win
the Pulitzer Prize...

687
01:23:37,692 --> 01:23:41,279
...for my favorite article of all time, "Why
the World Doesn't Need Superman"?

688
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:45,366
Didn't you have a few more years to go
on that double life sentence?

689
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:47,785
Yes, well, we can thank
the Man of Steel for that.

690
01:23:47,952 --> 01:23:51,247
I mean, he's really good at swooping in
and catching the bad guys...

691
01:23:51,414 --> 01:23:54,959
...but he's not so hot at the little things,
like Miranda rights...

692
01:23:55,126 --> 01:23:59,839
...due process, making your court date.

693
01:24:00,006 --> 01:24:02,466
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

694
01:24:05,469 --> 01:24:07,680
Are you fishing for an interview,
Miss Lane?

695
01:24:07,847 --> 01:24:10,016
It's been a while
since you've been a headline.

696
01:24:10,183 --> 01:24:12,351
Maybe it's time
people knew your name again.

697
01:24:13,019 --> 01:24:16,981
How about we turn this boat around,
call a cab for my son...

698
01:24:17,523 --> 01:24:20,151
...and then you can do
whatever you want with me.

699
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,404
No, I don't think we'll be
turning around, Miss Lane...

700
01:24:23,571 --> 01:24:26,199
...which means that
we do have some time to kill.

701
01:24:28,367 --> 01:24:30,244
How about that interview?

702
01:24:31,162 --> 01:24:34,498
Yeah, just call me if you hear anything.
Okay. Thank you.

703
01:24:34,665 --> 01:24:36,375
So, what did the school say?

704
01:24:36,542 --> 01:24:38,044
She picked him up at 3: 15.

705
01:24:42,298 --> 01:24:45,593
- Hi, I heard about Lois.
- Yes, come in, Clark, come in.

706
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,262
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, you're a reporter.

707
01:24:48,429 --> 01:24:51,182
- Help Richard track her down.
- I'll check her computer.

708
01:24:51,349 --> 01:24:52,600
Excuse me, Clark.

709
01:25:06,322 --> 01:25:09,408
What do you know about crystals?

710
01:25:09,575 --> 01:25:11,285
They make great chandeliers.

711
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:16,874
This crystal may seem unremarkable,
but so is the seed of a redwood tree.

712
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:20,461
It's how our mutual friend in tights
made his Arctic getaway spot.

713
01:25:20,628 --> 01:25:22,505
Cute. It's a little small for my taste.

714
01:25:22,672 --> 01:25:24,215
You're building an island?

715
01:25:25,424 --> 01:25:28,761
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Miss Lane.

716
01:25:28,928 --> 01:25:31,222
Let me enlarge it for you.

717
01:25:33,808 --> 01:25:37,228
Not just an island,
an entirely new continent.

718
01:25:37,395 --> 01:25:40,648
An extinct world, reborn on our own.

719
01:25:40,815 --> 01:25:42,233
Why?

720
01:25:45,236 --> 01:25:47,154
Land, Miss Lane.

721
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:50,074
I mean... Kitty, what did my father
used to say to me?

722
01:25:50,241 --> 01:25:51,659
"You're losing your hair"?

723
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,579
- Before that.
- "Get out"?

724
01:25:56,122 --> 01:25:58,416
He said, "You can print money...

725
01:25:58,583 --> 01:26:01,210
...manufacture diamonds,
and people are a dime a dozen...

726
01:26:01,377 --> 01:26:04,463
...but they'll always need land."

727
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:07,466
It's the one thing
they're not making any more of.

728
01:26:08,009 --> 01:26:10,386
But the United States...

729
01:26:12,096 --> 01:26:15,600
Will be underwater.

730
01:26:16,017 --> 01:26:17,602
It's simple physics, Miss Lane.

731
01:26:17,768 --> 01:26:20,563
Two objects cannot occupy
the same space at the same time.

732
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:23,274
And the rest of the world
will just let you keep it?

733
01:26:23,441 --> 01:26:25,651
- They'll...
- They'll...

734
01:26:26,152 --> 01:26:27,612
...what?

735
01:26:27,778 --> 01:26:30,656
I'll have advanced alien technology...

736
01:26:30,823 --> 01:26:33,868
...thousands of years beyond
what anyone could throw at me.

737
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:36,078
Bring it on!

738
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:38,998
And eventually...

739
01:26:39,165 --> 01:26:41,500
...the rest of the world
will be begging me...

740
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:44,295
...for a piece of high-tech
beachfront property.

741
01:26:44,462 --> 01:26:46,797
In fact, they'll pay
through the nose for it.

742
01:26:47,215 --> 01:26:48,966
But millions of people will die.

743
01:26:49,133 --> 01:26:51,761
Billions! Once again,
the press underestimates me.

744
01:26:51,928 --> 01:26:54,305
This is front-page news.

745
01:26:54,972 --> 01:26:56,974
Come on, let me hear you say it
just once.

746
01:26:57,141 --> 01:27:01,646
- You're insane.
- No! Not that. No, the other thing.

747
01:27:01,812 --> 01:27:05,483
It's dangling off the tip of your tongue.
Let me hear it just once, please?

748
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:08,653
- Superman will never...
- Wrong!

749
01:27:21,874 --> 01:27:23,501
What is that?

750
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:27,505
I think you know exactly what this is.

751
01:27:33,511 --> 01:27:36,389
Mind over muscle, Miss Lane.

752
01:27:37,515 --> 01:27:39,308
Mind...

753
01:27:46,858 --> 01:27:48,860
Who is that boy's father?

754
01:27:50,361 --> 01:27:52,238
Richard.

755
01:27:52,697 --> 01:27:56,200
<i>Mr. Luthor, we're approaching
the coordinates.</i>

756
01:27:56,784 --> 01:27:58,369
Are you sure?

757
01:27:58,536 --> 01:28:03,875
<i>Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north,
longitude 73 degrees west.</i>

758
01:28:25,396 --> 01:28:27,565
Don't let them leave this room.

759
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:30,484
Kitty, come with me.
You're not gonna want to miss this.

760
01:29:43,558 --> 01:29:44,934
- Damn it.
- What?

761
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:46,310
She has a password.

762
01:29:48,312 --> 01:29:49,897
"Jason."

763
01:29:51,983 --> 01:29:53,693
"Richard."

764
01:29:55,611 --> 01:29:57,196
Try "Superman."

765
01:30:02,326 --> 01:30:04,745
"Superman." Great.

766
01:30:13,087 --> 01:30:15,172
Don't touch that, honey.

767
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:21,888
Why don't you go play the piano.

768
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:21,632
Come on, come on, come on.

769
01:34:08,698 --> 01:34:11,742
Lex, this isn't like the train set.

770
01:34:13,661 --> 01:34:15,413
I know.

771
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,254
Come on, come on.

772
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,089
Come on.

773
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:54,887
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

774
01:35:55,054 --> 01:35:57,056
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

775
01:35:58,266 --> 01:36:01,018
Open this door! Open it!

776
01:36:16,367 --> 01:36:18,744
Could you help Mommy open the door?

777
01:36:21,622 --> 01:36:23,374
I'm sorry.

778
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,546
It's gonna be okay.

779
01:36:28,713 --> 01:36:31,048
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

780
01:36:50,735 --> 01:36:54,197
We had a little problem downstairs.

781
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:56,908
Brutus is dead.

782
01:36:57,575 --> 01:37:00,828
He got hit with the piano.

783
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:07,293
Where's the boy?

784
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,589
With the mother,
locked up in the pantry.

785
01:37:13,758 --> 01:37:15,927
Oh, it's time for us to go.

786
01:37:21,933 --> 01:37:24,435
My camera's not working.

787
01:37:25,228 --> 01:37:27,355
And my phone's not working.

788
01:37:32,401 --> 01:37:35,154
- Okay, I'm good.
- That was weird.

789
01:37:50,127 --> 01:37:52,463
Hey, guys.
This just came through the fax.

790
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:54,924
It's Lois' handwriting,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

791
01:37:55,091 --> 01:37:56,926
I just... No idea
what the numbers mean.

792
01:37:57,093 --> 01:37:58,845
- They're coordinates.
- Coordinates.

793
01:38:00,972 --> 01:38:02,181
That's just off the coast.

794
01:38:02,348 --> 01:38:05,476
Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane.
Keep trying her cell.

795
01:40:09,642 --> 01:40:11,102
What are these, lottery numbers?

796
01:40:11,644 --> 01:40:13,646
I think they're coordinates, chief.

797
01:40:52,351 --> 01:40:53,519
Chief...

798
01:41:20,421 --> 01:41:22,715
Come on! Move it!

799
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,152
Chief!

800
01:43:59,288 --> 01:44:01,707
Great Caesar's ghost.

801
01:46:08,668 --> 01:46:10,795
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

802
01:46:24,392 --> 01:46:25,810
How did you get here?

803
01:46:25,977 --> 01:46:27,645
I flew.

804
01:46:31,315 --> 01:46:33,150
Look out!

805
01:46:45,997 --> 01:46:47,707
Mom!

806
01:46:47,874 --> 01:46:50,001
Mom! Mom!

807
01:46:50,167 --> 01:46:51,544
Jason, come here! Jason!

808
01:46:54,422 --> 01:46:56,340
Come here! Watch your head!
Come here!

809
01:47:56,859 --> 01:47:58,653
Mommy! Mom!

810
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:01,822
Jason!

811
01:48:05,284 --> 01:48:06,786
Jason, hold on!

812
01:48:09,914 --> 01:48:12,583
- Have you got him?
- I got him! Go!

813
01:48:15,002 --> 01:48:16,587
Hold on! Hold on!

814
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:32,645
- Mommy!
- Give him to me!

815
01:48:32,812 --> 01:48:34,397
Mommy!

816
01:48:35,022 --> 01:48:36,941
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, Jason! Come on!

817
01:48:40,778 --> 01:48:43,614
- Lois! Lois!
- Mommy!

818
01:49:48,095 --> 01:49:50,181
Jason, get on my back.

819
01:50:20,211 --> 01:50:21,879
Give me your hand.

820
01:50:29,303 --> 01:50:31,597
- Have you got them?
- Yeah.

821
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,618
Get buckled in!

822
01:51:11,637 --> 01:51:13,514
She'll be fine.

823
01:51:16,267 --> 01:51:17,643
I can't take off in this.

824
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:21,772
- I'll point you in the right direction.
- Thank you.

825
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,833
See anything familiar?

826
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,259
I see an old man's sick joke.

827
01:52:31,759 --> 01:52:35,179
Really? Because I see
my new apartment...

828
01:52:35,346 --> 01:52:38,391
...and a place for Kitty,
one for my friends...

829
01:52:38,558 --> 01:52:41,519
...and that place over there, I'll rent out.

830
01:52:46,023 --> 01:52:50,236
But, you know, maybe you're right.
You know, maybe it is a little cold.

831
01:52:50,403 --> 01:52:54,365
It's... What's the word I'm searching for?
It's a little...

832
01:52:54,991 --> 01:52:56,701
...alien.

833
01:52:57,702 --> 01:53:01,539
It lacks that human touch.

834
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:07,211
You have something that belongs to me.

835
01:53:24,729 --> 01:53:28,024
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

836
01:53:28,191 --> 01:53:29,775
Do you copy?

837
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:34,113
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

838
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,616
Do you copy? Damn it!

839
01:53:36,782 --> 01:53:40,411
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

840
01:53:40,578 --> 01:53:42,413
Do you copy?

841
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:46,959
Lois! Are you all right?

842
01:53:47,376 --> 01:53:50,755
Yeah. What happened?

843
01:53:51,881 --> 01:53:54,509
- Superman.
- Where is he?

844
01:53:56,010 --> 01:53:57,261
He went back.

845
01:53:59,889 --> 01:54:02,099
- Richard, we have to turn around.
- What? No.

846
01:54:02,266 --> 01:54:04,894
- We have to turn around!
- We barely made it out of there.

847
01:54:05,061 --> 01:54:07,647
- Now you want me to go back?
- Yes, please!

848
01:54:08,397 --> 01:54:10,233
He'll die.

849
01:54:13,236 --> 01:54:15,112
All right, hold on.

850
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:34,465
Kryptonite.

851
01:54:39,595 --> 01:54:41,556
You're asking yourself, "How?"

852
01:54:43,349 --> 01:54:48,312
Didn't your dad ever teach you
to look before you leap?

853
01:54:52,358 --> 01:54:55,319
Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they?

854
01:54:55,486 --> 01:54:58,739
They inherit the traits
of the minerals around them...

855
01:54:58,906 --> 01:55:03,703
...kind of like a son
inheriting the traits of his father!

856
01:55:06,497 --> 01:55:11,502
You took away five years of my life,
I'm just returning the favor!

857
01:55:15,006 --> 01:55:18,050
I'm still Superman!

858
01:55:26,684 --> 01:55:30,104
Get up! Come on!

859
01:57:02,154 --> 01:57:04,156
Now, fly.

860
01:58:05,259 --> 01:58:08,221
So long, Superman.

861
01:58:10,681 --> 01:58:13,768
<i>Your leadership can stir others...</i>

862
01:58:13,935 --> 01:58:16,103
<i>... to their own capacities
for moral betterment.</i>

863
01:58:16,270 --> 01:58:19,232
<i>The human heart is still subject
to monstrous deceits.</i>

864
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:25,738
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided.
At this very moment...</i>

865
01:58:25,905 --> 01:58:27,532
<i>... I could embrace you in my arms.</i>

866
01:58:27,698 --> 01:58:30,117
<i>Your help would be called for endlessly.
Remember me.</i>

867
01:58:30,284 --> 01:58:33,621
<i>Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.</i>

868
01:58:44,048 --> 01:58:46,884
<i>Remember me, Kal-El.</i>

869
01:58:47,051 --> 01:58:48,970
<i>Remember me.</i>

870
01:58:57,854 --> 01:58:59,605
Superman's down there.

871
01:59:00,606 --> 01:59:02,984
- You sure?
- Yeah.

872
01:59:13,452 --> 01:59:16,080
- Richard!
- Yeah, I saw him. Strap in.

873
01:59:44,817 --> 01:59:46,611
Lois!

874
01:59:47,945 --> 01:59:49,739
Don't move.

875
02:00:35,826 --> 02:00:37,870
Come on, come on, come on.

876
02:00:41,624 --> 02:00:43,334
Richard!

877
02:00:43,501 --> 02:00:44,877
I'm trying! It's too choppy!

878
02:00:54,011 --> 02:00:55,596
Oh, my God.

879
02:02:43,287 --> 02:02:45,289
How did you find me?

880
02:02:50,795 --> 02:02:52,421
Thank you.

881
02:03:07,395 --> 02:03:09,313
What are you doing?

882
02:03:12,483 --> 02:03:13,734
I have to go back.

883
02:03:16,445 --> 02:03:18,197
You're hurt!

884
02:03:28,666 --> 02:03:30,334
Goodbye, Lois.

885
02:04:40,738 --> 02:04:43,074
<i>The technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...</i>

886
02:04:43,241 --> 02:04:45,576
<i>... was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.</i>

887
02:04:45,743 --> 02:04:47,119
<i>Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.</i>

888
02:04:47,286 --> 02:04:51,123
<i>Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...</i>

889
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:53,251
<i>... would be indistinguishable from magic.</i>

890
02:04:53,417 --> 02:04:56,838
<i>But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...</i>

891
02:04:57,004 --> 02:04:59,507
<i>... entire continents, all grown.</i>

892
02:04:59,674 --> 02:05:01,425
Lex?

893
02:05:03,261 --> 02:05:06,389
Are billions of people really going to die?

894
02:05:12,895 --> 02:05:14,605
Yes.

895
02:05:41,966 --> 02:05:43,301
Lex, what's happening?

896
02:05:49,265 --> 02:05:50,892
Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter.

897
02:05:53,769 --> 02:05:56,147
Go! Out, out! Now!

898
02:05:59,317 --> 02:06:02,486
No, no, no, take nothing!
Take nothing! Go, go!

899
02:06:04,405 --> 02:06:05,990
Got it.

900
02:06:50,117 --> 02:06:51,702
Here.

901
02:07:15,601 --> 02:07:17,562
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

902
02:07:17,728 --> 02:07:19,313
No!

903
02:07:38,875 --> 02:07:42,461
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

904
02:11:42,034 --> 02:11:43,536
Watch it.

905
02:11:44,912 --> 02:11:47,123
- Clear a path.
- Clear the way.

906
02:11:47,665 --> 02:11:49,292
- Move!
- Trauma One.

907
02:11:50,668 --> 02:11:53,004
- Where we going?
- Trauma One. Here it is.

908
02:11:58,843 --> 02:12:00,553
Watch it!

909
02:12:08,394 --> 02:12:09,770
Got him!

910
02:12:13,441 --> 02:12:14,817
Okay, I think I got it.

911
02:12:19,405 --> 02:12:22,241
Penetrating side wound
to right part of lower back.

912
02:12:23,576 --> 02:12:24,744
No hemorrhage.

913
02:12:29,415 --> 02:12:30,750
Shock at 200.

914
02:12:30,917 --> 02:12:32,752
Is that enough? He's not human.

915
02:12:32,919 --> 02:12:34,587
All right, charge to three, 360.

916
02:12:34,754 --> 02:12:36,339
Clear!

917
02:13:06,994 --> 02:13:08,287
It's kind of morbid, Perry.

918
02:13:09,121 --> 02:13:11,582
Always be prepared.

919
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,670
How is she?

920
02:13:35,189 --> 02:13:38,192
Thank you. Thanks, baby.

921
02:13:40,987 --> 02:13:42,238
- Lois?
- Yeah.

922
02:13:44,407 --> 02:13:46,325
We can leave whenever you're ready.

923
02:13:46,492 --> 02:13:48,077
I mean...

924
02:13:49,662 --> 02:13:51,664
...you don't have to be here.

925
02:13:52,874 --> 02:13:54,709
Where else would I be?

926
02:13:54,876 --> 02:13:58,421
<i>Police have surrounded the area in order
to control thousands of visitors...</i>

927
02:13:58,588 --> 02:14:00,506
<i>... who have arrived
to show their support.</i>

928
02:14:00,673 --> 02:14:02,466
<i>Many are carrying signs and banners...</i>

929
02:14:02,633 --> 02:14:04,051
I could drive.

930
02:14:04,218 --> 02:14:06,679
<i>- No official announcements
over the past few hours...</i>

931
02:14:06,846 --> 02:14:09,432
<i>... but unconfirmed reports
from inside tell us...</i>

932
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:11,392
<i>... the Man of Steel lies in a coma...</i>

933
02:14:11,559 --> 02:14:16,105
<i>... his condition unchanged
since he was admitted late yesterday.</i>

934
02:14:21,277 --> 02:14:24,530
<i>- Doctors have been vigilant in their...
- Foreign exchange markets...</i>

935
02:14:24,989 --> 02:14:28,034
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

936
02:14:28,201 --> 02:14:31,078
I'd be careful down there, guys.
It's a madhouse.

937
02:14:40,796 --> 02:14:43,925
- So much for parking.
- Do you think I can get in?

938
02:14:44,675 --> 02:14:47,553
You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in.

939
02:14:48,513 --> 02:14:51,349
I wanna go with Mommy.

940
02:15:12,537 --> 02:15:14,205
Taxi.

941
02:15:14,372 --> 02:15:15,832
I'll be right here.

942
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:25,258
Watch your head, okay? Here we go.

943
02:15:57,331 --> 02:15:59,292
This way, Miss Lane.

944
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:24,483
Mommy? Is he gonna get better?

945
02:16:26,527 --> 02:16:29,155
- I don't know.
- I want him to.

946
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:32,825
I like him.

947
02:16:35,536 --> 02:16:37,205
Me too.

948
02:17:08,361 --> 02:17:11,155
I don't know if you can hear me.

949
02:17:13,783 --> 02:17:17,286
They say sometimes
that when people are...

950
02:17:20,289 --> 02:17:23,042
That sometimes they can hear you.

951
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:31,592
I don't know if you can hear me.

952
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:43,145
I wanted to tell you...

953
02:18:38,451 --> 02:18:40,369
Come on, honey.

954
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:26,165
Step back, please!

955
02:19:43,349 --> 02:19:47,103
Lex, we only have six of those!

956
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:50,273
Six?

957
02:19:54,068 --> 02:19:58,406
I would trade 300,000 coconuts...

958
02:19:58,573 --> 02:20:00,908
...and every ounce of your blood...

959
02:20:01,075 --> 02:20:05,705
...for a quart of gasoline!

960
02:20:06,455 --> 02:20:09,125
But what will we have to eat?

961
02:22:45,281 --> 02:22:47,325
You will be different.

962
02:22:50,995 --> 02:22:53,956
Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast.

963
02:22:55,124 --> 02:22:57,835
But you'll never be alone.

964
02:23:00,213 --> 02:23:02,882
You will make my strength your own.

965
02:23:05,843 --> 02:23:09,555
You will see my life through your eyes...

966
02:23:10,431 --> 02:23:15,811
...as your life will be seen through mine.

967
02:23:27,406 --> 02:23:31,452
The son becomes the father...

968
02:23:33,162 --> 02:23:37,917
...and the father becomes the son.

969
02:24:29,635 --> 02:24:31,470
Good night!

970
02:24:41,314 --> 02:24:42,732
I...

971
02:24:51,574 --> 02:24:53,534
Will we see you?

972
02:24:55,578 --> 02:24:57,246
Around?

973
02:24:59,749 --> 02:25:01,918
I'm always around.

974
02:25:06,964 --> 02:25:08,674
Good night, Lois.
