1
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:16,000
I will now tell you about my brother.
My brother, Jonathan Lionheart.

2
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:26,792
It's almost like a fairytale,
and yet all of it is true.

3
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:31,292
But only Jonathan and I knows that.

4
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:36,500
Everybody in the whole town loved Jonathan.

5
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:44,208
Jonathan was originally named Lion,
just like mom and me.

6
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:50,500
My name is Karl.
Jonathan calls me Rusk,

7
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:57,417
only because he loves rusks so much,
he says.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,500
It was that day when I found out
that i'm about to die.

9
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:11,333
One of those ladies whom my mom
sows dresses for said it.

10
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:36,083
- What is it, Rusk? Are you sad?
- Yes...

11
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,583
Jonatan, do you know that i'm about to die?

12
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,042
Yes, I know that.

13
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:07,500
How can it be so horrible, that some
of us must die before they've turned ten?

14
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,250
Know what, Rusk?
I don't think it's that bad.

15
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:21,750
It's bad to just lie in the ground,
and be dead, isn't it?

16
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:25,500
It's just your shell that lies there.

17
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:30,750
Your soul flies away somewhere else,
far away.

18
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:35,208
Where to?

19
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:42,542
- To Nangijala.
- Nangijala...?

20
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:50,792
Somewhere beyond the stars. It lies
in a time of campfires and fairytales.

21
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:59,292
There you will experience adventures.
That'll be something else than just lying
here being sick.

22
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:07,417
In Nangijala, you'll be strong and healthy.

23
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:14,750
[Mom sings]
"Dör jag på sjön, du ljuva,
kanske en kväll...

24
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:22,292
...flyger en snövit duva
hem till ditt tjäll...

25
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,583
[Karl coughs]

26
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:48,708
...flyger en snövit duva
hem till ditt tjäll"

27
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:57,042
Maybe you'll come flying to visit me
some night... from Nangijala.

28
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:05,250
And you'll sit there, by the window,
like a snow white pigeon.

29
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:10,083
Here - have some honeywater, Rusk.

30
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:19,458
Jonathan, i'm afraid.
I don't want to go to Nangijala.

31
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,417
I want to be here with you.

32
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:37,333
You'll probably live until your ninety,
and I'll have to wait for you until then!

33
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,583
Yes, but even though I might turn ninety
years old...

34
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:50,708
...it's only like two days for you.
And you can handle being alone for two days,
can't you?

35
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:57,917
You'll climb in the trees,
and make a campfire.

36
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:02,208
You'll do some fishing by the lake.

37
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:11,375
And suddenly, as you catch that perch,
I'll come flying.

38
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:18,667
Wouldn't it be great if you were there
before me, and you were the one doing the
fishing...

39
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:23,208
...and I came flying.

40
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:31,167
But instead, I might have to live on
earth for ninety years before I get to
see my Rusk again.

41
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:40,042
Well, that's what we thought,
but it didn't turn out that way.

42
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,875
Jonatan is in Nangijala now.

43
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:24,792
We jumped.
I made it, Jonathan didn't.

44
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,417
Dear Jonathan Lejon...

45
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:39,875
...shouldn't your name really have been;
Jonathan Lejonhjärta?

46
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:47,750
When we read about the brave english
king Richard Lionheart...

47
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:53,583
I wasn't on Jonathan's funeral,
i was too ill.

48
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,417
His old schoolteacher held a speech
for him.

49
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:05,583
It was good that she made up that part
about Lionheart, really good.

50
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:13,958
I'm afraid.
What if Nangijala doesn't exist?

51
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:21,917
What if it's one of those things that
Jonathan just made up.

52
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:08,375
"Flyger en snövit duva
hem till ditt tjäll. "

53
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:12,042
Jonathan...!

54
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,958
Then it is true.

55
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:23,250
In Nangijala, in Cherry Valley...

56
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:38,958
Will you sit down by the lake,
when I arrive?

57
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:46,583
No... I am not afraid anymore.

58
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,500
Send my regards to Nangijala!
I will soon be there!

59
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,625
[Karl coughs]

60
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,458
Jonathan...

61
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:40,167
Jonathan!

62
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,458
Jonathan!

63
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:52,000
- Jonathan!
- Rusk!

64
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,583
[Laughter]

65
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,875
Jonathan...

66
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,375
Jonathan!

67
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:06,167
[Screaming and laughter]

68
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,250
- Look! I can swim!
- Of course you can, you're in Nangijala now!

69
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:49,625
Jonathan, we've got rabbits!
Oh, they're so cute.

70
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,958
Jonathan, can I let one out and
play with it?

71
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:04,792
Look, we've got horses too!

72
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:15,042
- Oh, they are so beautiful!
- This is Grim and Fjalar.

73
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:21,667
- Guess which one's yours.
- Mine?! But I don't even know how to ride a horse!

74
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:27,167
- Well, you could swim, couldn't you?
- Yes, but do I know how to ride, as well?

75
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:32,958
- Yes. Guess which one's yours.
- The white one, maybe?

76
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:39,625
Nope, you guessed wrong.
Grim, is my horse. Fjalar is yours.

77
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,875
My own horse...!

78
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,375
Sophia!

79
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:24,250
Well, Jonathan. Your brother finally
arrived, didn't he?

80
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:31,917
- This is Sophia.
- I brought you something to eat.

81
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:37,708
You'll be at Golden Rooster tonight,
won't you? Bring Karl too.

82
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:43,750
- So how's Cherry Valley?
- We rode today...

83
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:46,917
...and I can swim.

84
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:07,667
Wow, I look great! And you look even better!
You look like a prince!

85
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,542
[Laughter]

86
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:49,708
You told me that, in Nangijala there
will be adventures from morning 'til
night.

87
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:57,083
And during the nights as well, do you
remember that? But this place seems
so peaceful.

88
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:04,083
Yes, but there are adventures here
that shouldn't be, but don't be afraid.

89
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,125
- Remember that your name is Lionheart.
- Rusk Lionheart.

90
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:13,667
We'll have to call you Karl,
so people won't laugh at you.

91
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:29,375
- I've never been to an inn before.
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

92
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:34,208
There are only nice people in here.

93
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,250
[Music]

94
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:57,542
- Here's Jonathan!
- Yes, here comes Jonathan!

95
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:03,917
Oh look, here are the Brothers Lionheart,
both of them!

96
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:10,917
This is my brother, Karl Lionheart,
who's finally arrived.

97
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:18,292
And you will all be nice to him,
just like you've been to me.

98
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:25,708
We'll become great friends. My name is
Jossi, but people call me Golden Rooster!

99
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:33,250
And you can come see me whenever you like!
Don't you forget that, Karl Lionheart!

100
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:38,625
Now, let's get you some food.
Come!

101
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:48,583
The message will arrive tomorrow morning.
Will you attend?

102
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:15,167
- Have you told Hubert?
- Shh!

103
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:22,542
Well, Karl, did you like your horse?

104
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:27,375
It's the most beautiful horse in existence.

105
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:48,958
What's so special about Sophia?

106
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:57,458
Right. What's so special about Sophia.
I've been wondering about that for
very long.

107
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:04,292
- Who's that?
- He... his name is Hubert.

108
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:11,708
And he know god damn well what's so
special about Sophia.

109
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,708
[Singing]
"Sjung du min dal med brinnande röst"

110
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:33,500
"tyst dina heta sånger"

111
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:39,500
"Sjung markens gräs
och susa vart träd"

112
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:44,750
"sakta om dagen som kommer"

113
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:50,417
"Sjung källa och flod
sjung stenar och jord"

114
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:55,458
"Ge oss till tröst era sånger"

115
00:20:55,625 --> 00:21:00,833
"O, sjung du min dal
och brinn i din tro"

116
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,458
på frihetens dag som kommer"

117
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:41,042
How come they're treating Sophia so special?
what's so special about her?

118
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:48,042
You tell me?
We call her The Pigeon Queen.

119
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:52,375
The Pigeon Queen?

120
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:14,708
Jonathan, were you one of Sophia's pigeons,
when you visited me?

121
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:21,333
Yes, only Sophia's pigeons may fly
through the skies, how far as ever.

122
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,417
And they are the only ones who can
get into Rose Thorn Valley.

123
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:33,375
It's like this,
Nangijala is divided into two green valleys.

124
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:38,792
Here lies Cherry Valley,
and over there...

125
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:43,417
...beyond the mountains, lay Rose Thorn Valley.

126
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:50,208
Tengil and his riders have conquered it.
The people are his slaves.

127
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:59,333
But Sophia's pigeons, they fly over mountains
and walls with their messages.

128
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:10,333
Oh, you're heading to Sophia?
What are you up to?

129
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,875
- I'm her garden helper.
- I know that, Jonathan.

130
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:24,333
- And you're out hunting?
- I was gonna shoot me a couple of wild rabbits.

131
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,667
Oh, her garden helper, sure...

132
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:42,208
Why are you looking so sad, Sophia?

133
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:49,375
I found Violanta dead, with an arrow
in her chest, and the message gone.

134
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:54,417
Then there is a traitor in Cherry Valley.

135
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:59,875
Thank god, here comes Paloma!

136
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,958
Are you carrying a happier message for me
this time, Paloma?

137
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:13,667
- I can't stand bad news again.
- What does it say?

138
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:19,875
"Orvar was captured yesterday, and is
now kept prisoner in Katla Cave."

139
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:26,667
"Someone in Cherry Valley betrayed his
whereabouts. Find out who."

140
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:32,250
It can't be true!
Who could be that foul?

141
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:40,208
I don't know, not yet. But god help him
when I find out.

142
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:47,250
...and poor Karl, with that clueless look.

143
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:52,250
Tell him everything.
He must also know.

144
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:58,458
Without Orvar, Rose Thorn Valley will
never get its freedom back.

145
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:06,833
He leads the struggle against Tengil.
But he's been captured and brought to
the Katla Cave in Tengil's land.

146
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,708
Jonathan.

147
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:25,417
Jonathan!

148
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:30,667
- Jonathan!
- Yes, what is it?

149
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:37,042
- Does everyone in Cherry Valley know about this?
- About what?

150
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:43,625
This about Sophia's pigeons, and the
secret messages, and all?

151
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:49,667
No, only the one that we deem
trustworthy.

152
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:53,458
But among them is a traitor.

153
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:35,458
Rusk, you're gonna have to remain
alone on Rider's Farm for a while.

154
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:42,708
- I must leave for Rose Thorn Valley.
- What are you saying?! Aren't you ashamed?!

155
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,292
Rusk!

156
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:53,792
If you're gonna let Tengil catch you,
then I'll come with you!

157
00:26:57,167 --> 00:27:04,792
I'm not waiting around!
Maybe you'll never return!

158
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:41,458
Rusk...

159
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:46,125
I can't bring you along for
something that dangerous.

160
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:54,083
I'm Sophia's closest man.
I must save Orvar.

161
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:00,292
Why can't Sophia go by herself, then?

162
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:06,542
We can't afford to lose her.
She leads the struggle. Tengil knows this.

163
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:13,667
The one who catches her alive will
be rewarded with fifteen white horses.

164
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:18,500
How many for the one who catches you,
then?

165
00:28:57,083 --> 00:29:03,333
Why do you have to do things that
are that dangerous?

166
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:12,417
There are things that must be done,
even though they're dangerous.

167
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:18,292
- Why?
- Otherwise you're no human being...

168
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:22,625
...but just a small piece of dirt.

169
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:45,292
Jonathan!

170
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:55,792
- Are you sure you're coming back?
- Don't be sad. I'm sure.

171
00:29:55,958 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't even know where you're going.

172
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:07,958
To Rose Thorn Valley, and then to Tengil's
land, to the Mountain of Ages Past.

173
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:52,250
- No, don't shoot!
- What are you doing this far from home?

174
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:57,458
I'm out riding.
I see you're out hunting?

175
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,458
That's one way to put it, yes.

176
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:09,250
Ask Jonathan to stop by the Golden Rooster
some time.

177
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:13,042
He's in the mountains, hunting wolf.

178
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,458
Sophia!

179
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:49,417
Sophia!

180
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:57,333
- Oh Karl, are you out this late?
- Hubert is the traitor!

181
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,667
He tried to shoot one of your pigeons!

182
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:09,333
Anyone but Hubert.
He fights for freedom, just like us.

183
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:18,167
- Have you heard anything from Jonathan?
- Neither good, nor evil.

184
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:26,167
- How are you keeping up?
- I miss Jonathan.

185
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,167
- Help!
- Jonathan!

186
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:09,500
Yes, Jonathan. I will come.

187
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:20,250
I'll do it.
I'm no piece of dirt.

188
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:38,458
Has he been here already?

189
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:46,583
- He would have waited.
- Well, who was here, then?

190
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,958
We'll get him for sure,
unless he shows up!

191
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:57,875
What's his use, anyway?
Shooting pigeons...

192
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:18,583
Time to brand him with the mark of Katla,
so he knows where he belong.

193
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,417
It'll be my pleasure.

194
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:34,042
Ah, there he is, finally!

195
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:41,250
- So it's finally time to arrive, is it?
- Jossi...

196
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:53,458
This is from the pigeon I shot last night.

197
00:35:56,583 --> 00:36:03,208
Lionheart is still at large, we know that!
A hundred men are looking for him, day and night!

198
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:07,167
Find out where he's hiding.

199
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:12,667
He's got a little brother, in Cherry Valley,
who he loves dearly.

200
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:18,917
We'll use him as bait, and we'll be
able to catch both Sophia and Lionheart.

201
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:23,417
Why haven't you told us earlier?

202
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:28,417
I don't want you to hurt the boy.
I'm kinda fond of him.

203
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:34,625
- You haven't forgotten the password, have you?
- "All power to Tengil - our saviour!"

204
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:40,208
Tengil hasn't forgotten his promise,
has he?

205
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:45,292
Jossi - Chieftain of Cherry Valley!

206
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:49,917
Sure sure.
And you'll get the mark of Katla, too!

207
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,125
No!

208
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:57,417
Ouch!

209
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:04,708
Now you know that you are one of us,
forever! And a traitor, you are!

210
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:16,292
That one...
that'll be a swell meal for Katla.

211
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,667
Bring out the horses.

212
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,167
Look, there they are!

213
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:52,500
[Fjalar neighs]
Fjalar! Shut up!

214
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:18,792
How long have you been lying here,
spying on us?

215
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:24,917
Well, where do you belong?
Cherry Valley or Rose Thorn Valley?

216
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:29,792
Where do you live?!

217
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:34,208
- Rose Thorn Valley.
- Well, we'll find out about that!

218
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:40,792
- What were you doing in the mountains?
- I was just watching the moonlight...

219
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:51,250
- Who are you parents, then?
- My parents...?

220
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:56,333
- I live with my grandpa.
- What's his name, then?

221
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,250
What his name is?

222
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:05,125
- Just "grandpa".
- You're kinda stupid, aren't you?

223
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:12,542
- Where in Rose Thorn Valley does he live, then?
- In a small white house...

224
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:19,833
This grandpa, and this house,
you're about to show us.

225
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:55,583
- Password!
- All power to Tengil - our saviour!

226
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:01,875
- Who's this?
- A silly we found in the mountains.

227
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:07,125
How did he get out of Rose Thorn Valley
last night?

228
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:14,042
- Who was on guard last night?
- Step aside, we're passing through!

229
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:30,250
Ride ahead and show us the way.

230
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:38,708
Halt!

231
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:43,333
Search the wagon!

232
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,250
- Where is your grandpa? Is he far off?
- No. Not too far.

233
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:46,792
Why are you stopping?

234
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:51,417
Do you recognise this boy?

235
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:59,375
If we don't find your grandpa soon,
we'll throw you in the Katla Cave.

236
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:32,500
Help me! Save me! Tell them you're
my grandpa.

237
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:42,875
What do you mean... what do you mean
by staying out so long?

238
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:47,417
What have you been up to, with these
soldiers showing up, and all?!

239
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:51,583
Better watch out for your grandchildren!

240
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:57,958
He was far away in the mountains.
It is punishable by death to be there.

241
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:02,375
- Were you?
- He was!

242
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:07,208
In order to watch the moonlight!

243
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,458
Are you really that mad, boy?

244
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:19,500
If you don't behave better, you
may soon not have any grandchildren left!

245
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:30,375
There, there. It's over now.

246
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:39,917
- I really wish you were my grandpa.
- Well, I'll be your grandpa, alright.

247
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:44,333
My name is Mattias. What is yours?

248
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:53,208
My name is... please Mattias, my name
must remain a secret, but you may call me Rusk.

249
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:09,375
Hey, wake up.

250
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:15,625
Come, and I will show you something,
Rusk Lionheart.

251
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:21,583
- I never told you my name is Lionheart.
- No, you didn't.

252
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:28,417
For that is a name that must not
be said aloud in Rose Thorn Valley.

253
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:48,208
Well, let's see.

254
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,458
Go down.

255
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:55,875
Just go down.

256
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:04,958
Don't be afraid.

257
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,458
Jonathan!

258
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:37,208
- Do you think it's bad that i'm here?
- No, Rusk.

259
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:42,042
I've missed you so much.

260
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:51,292
You yelled... you yelled for help.

261
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:55,625
Why were you yelling?

262
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:04,458
I saw Katla.
I saw what Katla did.

263
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:12,708
Jonathan, I know now who the traitor
of Cherry Valley is. It is Jossi.

264
00:46:55,083 --> 00:47:02,375
Fly, my Bianca, over the mountains
of Nangijala, to Cherry Valley.

265
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:12,708
Fly to Sophia, with the name of
the traitor!

266
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:18,333
- What are you doing outside, old man?
- Go to grandpa!

267
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,542
Such a nice weather tonight.

268
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:30,542
You do know that it is punishable by
death to remain outside after dawn,
don't you?

269
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:39,417
- By the way, where is the boy?
- The boy...? The boy?

270
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:43,708
Here he is!

271
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:54,792
Aren't you gonna head off to the
mountains to watch the moonlight?
What was your name again?

272
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:59,333
- Rusk...
- Rusk.

273
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:06,292
Tell your grandpa what happens if you're
not inside before dawn.

274
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:11,583
- Let's go inside, boy.
- Hey, old man!

275
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:17,667
- You wouldn't know where Lionheart is, would you?
- I don't know anyone named Lionheart.

276
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:25,292
Lucky you, for a death sentence awaits
the one who is giving him shelter.

277
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:32,167
Death sentence here, and death sentence there...
that's the only thing they'll ever say.

278
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,375
[Trumpets]

279
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:57,458
People of Rose Thorn Valley!

280
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:03,583
From the Mountains of Ages Past,
over the Lake of Ages Past,

281
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:11,542
your saviour has come! Tengil
of Karmanjaka has something to say!

282
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:26,125
Thus spoke our merciful duke:
He is disappointed with the people of
Rose Thorn Valley!

283
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:34,458
Lionheart is yet to be found!
The people of Rose Thorn Valley
are hiding him.

284
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:39,208
Our merciful duke's patience is
about to run out.

285
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:46,667
He will punish Rose Thorn Valley
cruelly and mercilessly!

286
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:56,792
But our merciful duke will postpone
the punishment!

287
00:49:56,958 --> 00:50:03,292
And listen up, good people,
he will reward you well!

288
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:09,333
Twenty white horses, to the one
who captures Lionheart for him!

289
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,625
- Then I shall find the bastard.
- Have you no sense?

290
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:20,000
- No, not too much, anyway.
- Jonathan!

291
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:28,042
- Are you out of your mind?
- I must see what's going on.

292
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:36,292
Our merciful duke has yet
another errand!

293
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:42,500
Every man in Rose Thorn Valley,
who can work, step forward!

294
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:23,292
- Where are they taking those people?
- They're off to Karmanjaka...

295
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:27,208
...to drag rocks to Tengil's keep.

296
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:36,292
The one he's built on the top
of the Mountain of Ages Past.

297
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:43,208
They'll work until they have no strength
left, and then Katla'll get them.

298
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:50,000
No, no, no...

299
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:58,417
Tyrant! One day you will die, too!

300
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:02,750
Have you ever thought about that?

301
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,417
[Weeping]

302
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:42,125
- Where does this tunnel end?
- On the other side of the wall.

303
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:47,708
- When it's done, anyway.
- And then?

304
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:54,500
Then we'll rescue Orvar from the
Katla Cave.

305
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:59,542
Jonathan... who is Katla?

306
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,083
[Footsteps above]

307
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:19,542
Are you out of your mind? Leaving
the hatch open, without anyone keeping
watch?

308
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:25,542
Get this through your head:
Never let Jonathan be down there...

309
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:33,542
...without closing the hatch!
Tengil reigns this land.

310
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm sorry, we forgot. Here's some
more dirt for you field.

311
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:50,125
Dark, the night shall be,
in Rose Thorn Valley.

312
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:55,917
There are many eyes here, who want
to see what they must not see.

313
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:48,042
What's going on?

314
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:56,167
- What's going on here?
- You're about to find out!

315
00:54:56,333 --> 00:55:00,500
- Get up!
- Ouch!

316
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,958
There is no Lionheart. It's just an
excuse to turn people's houses upside
down.

317
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:16,917
Beware, old man, or I'll cut your ears
off, and maybe your nose aswell!

318
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:58,042
Look, a fire! Are you out of your mind?
...to throw wool in front of a fire!

319
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:05,375
Silent! Or I'll think of several
ways to keep you quiet.

320
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:09,333
Aren't you going to clean up?

321
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,708
Why don't you clean up your dump yourself,
old man!

322
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:33,917
[Entering the stables]

323
00:56:39,292 --> 00:56:45,833
You don't need two horses.
Put your mark on this.

324
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,708
- You're gladly giving Tengil your horses.
- I don't feel any joy.

325
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:59,167
You do too. We'll send a man to get
the horses tonight.

326
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:04,667
If you want to live, you'll give
him the badge with your mark on.

327
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:11,000
Tengil wants proof of you giving
your horses to us freely.

328
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:17,792
Are one supposed to laugh or cry?

329
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:25,000
- Why don't you dress up like a soldier?
- That won't help.

330
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:30,042
There, there.
Don't cry in the soup, little Rusk.

331
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:35,000
There's already enough water in there.

332
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:42,458
The password...
If I only had that password!

333
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,125
What password?

334
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:53,417
You've got to have a password to
pass through the gates.

335
00:57:53,583 --> 00:58:01,000
I heard that from Jossi, while
i was in the cave.

336
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:09,125
- Do you remember it?
-"All power to Tengil - our saviour."

337
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:13,917
You know something? I really like you.

338
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:33,292
Take good care of yourself, Mattias;
Until we meet again.

339
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:40,583
You too. Take care,
Jonathan Lionheart.

340
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:53,125
Goodbye then, boy!
Don't forget your grandpa!

341
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:57,958
I'll never forget you!
Never ever!

342
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:14,458
- Grandpa, do you think we'll find Orvar?
- I'll keep my fingers crossed.

343
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:29,458
What if Jonathan isn't waiting for me?

344
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:33,375
What if he never got out?

345
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:36,792
[Knocking]

346
00:59:57,042 --> 01:00:03,667
Hey! Old man! The stables are empty!
Where are your horses?

347
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:10,500
My horses...? You've already
taken them, damn it.

348
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:13,000
What?!

349
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:33,333
- Ask the guards by the gate!
- I don't understand.

350
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:40,792
Is it really my fault that you mess
things up so badly that you don't even
know what you're doing anymore?

351
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:12,500
Karma Falls.
The river of ages past.

352
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:24,208
Now we must eat and sleep.
Tomorrow we must continue by foot.

353
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:31,667
- What about Grim and Fjalar?
- They'll be safe here until we return.

354
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:51,167
There, on the other side, lies
Karmanjaka. The land of Tengil.

355
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:57,250
We're sitting by a campfire, you and me.

356
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:02,333
I've longed for this all my life.

357
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:11,042
"in a time of campfires and fairytales",
do you remember saying that?

358
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:17,542
I didn't know back then, that the
fairytales of Nangijala would be
this evil.

359
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:23,292
- Must it always be that way?
- No.

360
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:28,000
When the final battle is over...

361
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:35,958
...the fairytales will be beautiful
again, and life will be easy.

362
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:45,417
But the final battle, Rusk,
will be a sinister story,

363
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:53,667
containing only death.
That battle must be led by Orvar.

364
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:59,167
I can't kill anyone.

365
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:05,000
I know that.

366
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,750
[Roar]

367
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:37,333
What was that? There!

368
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,875
Jonathan, i'm afraid.

369
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:51,958
Don't worry, she can't come here.

370
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,125
She is a monster.

371
01:05:10,292 --> 01:05:19,333
A female dragon, from ages past,
much as cruel as Tengil himself.

372
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:24,167
When he blows his horn, she'll
do whatever he commands.

373
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:30,042
She'll come creeping, like a dog.

374
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:53,667
Up there, lies Tengil's Keep.

375
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:58,958
- Where is the Katla Cave, then?
- Come.

376
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:23,833
The Black Keepers are bringing
Katla here tonight!

377
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,125
Tell that pig that this will be
his last supper!

378
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:36,208
As the saying goes:
Orvar might die, but freedom will never!

379
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:41,417
Well, we'll see what Katla has
to say about that. Tonight.

380
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:48,917
- We'll never get through there, right?
- No, not through the copper gate.

381
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:53,917
The stories speak of another entrance,
just north of the mountains.

382
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:17,250
Yes, this one. I don't know
what awaits me in there...

383
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:20,917
but i'm going.

384
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:25,917
It'll be a long and hard way back.

385
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:30,750
I probably won't be back for quite
some time.

386
01:08:30,917 --> 01:08:35,667
If you're going, i'm going too.

387
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:27,708
[A door opens]

388
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:48,083
Well well, Orvar of Rose Thorn Valley.

389
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:52,917
The black collectors are on their way.

390
01:10:55,750 --> 01:11:02,208
Tengil decided to allow you to have
a torch with you during your last moments...

391
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:10,167
...so you'll get used to the light,
and you'll be able to see Katla,
once you meet her.

392
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:37,250
- Who are you?
-Jonatan and Karl Lionheart.

393
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:43,958
- We are here to set you free.
- Jonathan! I've heard about you.

394
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:49,250
I'll get you out of here.

395
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:18,792
He's gone!
He's fled into the mountain!

396
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:22,583
The prisoner has escaped!

397
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:27,125
You! Ride to Tengil's castle
and report this!

398
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:32,875
Alarm all guards!
Quick! Seal the bridge!

399
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:08,083
[Orvar laughs]

400
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:21,458
Thank you! Thank you, Lionheart!

401
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:43,042
Get their clothes, and we'll pretend
that you're a soldier, and we're your
prisoners.

402
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:47,125
They bear the stench of hate
and oppression!

403
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:51,500
We've got to get to Rose Thorn Valley.

404
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:57,833
Seal all ways out of Karmanjaka!
The prisoner has escaped!

405
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:13,875
Hurry up!

406
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,875
- Password?
- All power to Tengil - our saviour.

407
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:31,958
Two prisoners who carry information
concerning weapon stashes in Cherry
Valley.

408
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:37,542
Go away, you scoundrels. Come on!

409
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:52,417
What are you doing? None shall pass!

410
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,250
Come on!

411
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:35,542
I'll jump off behind a creek when
the soldiers can't see, and you'll
ride and catch up with Orvar.

412
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:43,333
- Are you sure?
- No, but I don't want to be a piece
of dirt..

413
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:53,208
I'll come get you when Orvar is safe.

414
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,833
[A horse]

415
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:33,667
- Sophia!
- Oh Karl, what are you doing here?!

416
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:43,667
- Where is Jonatan?
- He saved Orvar from the Katla Cave.

417
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:48,000
What? You can't be serious?!

418
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:52,708
That was the best piece of news we
could ever get.

419
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:58,792
- Cherry Valley will be alright now.
- Where are you headed?

420
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:05,000
Jossi's going to show us where
to best break through the wall.

421
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:09,083
Jossi, yes!

422
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:14,167
Karl Lionheart... of all the
places.

423
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:18,500
Sophia, how are the pigeons? Bianca?

424
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:25,375
She never came back.
Someone must have shot her down.

425
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:31,333
I realised.
Jossi is the traitor.

426
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:37,708
- I thought I was the traitor?
- You ought to stop throwing
accusations around.

427
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:41,792
- I'm sorry, Hubert.
- What about Jossi?

428
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:45,667
Ask him about the meetings in the
mountains...

429
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:51,000
Ask him how he betrayed Orvar...

430
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:55,333
Show us your chest!

431
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:00,667
That's ridiculous, we're in
a hurry! We've got to go!

432
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:05,417
Not so fast, Jossi!

433
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:09,167
Show us your chest!

434
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:19,000
Traitor! curse you and the things
you've done to Cherry Valley!

435
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,875
No, Hubert! Let him run.

436
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:44,250
I will punish you, Sophia! When i
become chieftain of Cherry Valley,
i will punish you hard!

437
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:47,583
Aah!

438
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:53,750
Poor Jossi. You'll never return
to Cherry Valley!

439
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:59,375
You'll end up in the Karma Falls,
and nowhere else.

440
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:28,000
When are they arriving? We can't
keep this a secret for much longer.

441
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:36,542
The riders have passed through the mountains.
They'll be here this evening, or this night.

442
01:19:36,708 --> 01:19:43,458
- We need everyone from Cherry Valley!
- Everyone who's able to fight is here.

443
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:51,958
- The people of Rose Thorn Valley are starving.
- Bread and weapons are due to arrive.

444
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:10,958
The day of battle! The day of freedom!

445
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:20,750
Free the valley from Tengil's men...

446
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:27,583
- You mean, to kill?
- Yes, what else could I mean?

447
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:35,625
No, of course... but I can't kill
anyone, and you know it, Orvar!

448
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:40,542
If everyone thought like that,
evil would reign forever.

449
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:48,708
If everyone thought like Jonathan,
then there'd be no evil.

450
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:55,833
- You've done enough already.
- Your presence would mean a lot.

451
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:03,792
Just the thought of having Lionheart
among us, should inspire courage!

452
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:25,917
No, come with me, Rusk.

453
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:36,000
- It's so great to have a grandpa!
- Of course it is.

454
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:42,417
It's pretty good to have a Rusk
around, as well.

455
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:59,250
It is time.

456
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:08,375
Fly high. You're carrying a message
to all that see you, that the day of
battle is here...

457
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:12,708
and the day of freedom, I hope.

458
01:22:59,917 --> 01:23:02,958
Forward!

459
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:31,500
[Battlecries]

460
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:55,417
I don't want him to die...

461
01:23:55,583 --> 01:24:00,792
- I'll just have to try not to, then.
- Yes...

462
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,667
Jonathan!

463
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:12,958
Jonathan!

464
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:23,750
Jonathan!

465
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:30,125
Jonathan Lionheart!
You're needed out there!

466
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:35,542
Fjalar is here!

467
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,500
Then we'll leave.

468
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:41,500
Victory is ours!

469
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:45,125
Mattias!

470
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:49,458
Mattias! They're fleeing!
We're winning!

471
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:12,000
[Sound of a horn]

472
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:15,333
[A roar]

473
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:36,333
Katla's coming! Retreat!

474
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:47,042
Go! Go!

475
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,625
[Katla roars]

476
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:55,375
[Blowing the horn]

477
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:11,667
[Roar]

478
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:24,833
[Blowing the horn]

479
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:30,833
[Roar]

480
01:33:52,417 --> 01:34:00,292
We are free, but what have we
not sacrificed?

481
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:09,208
- I'm just gonna visit grandpa.
- But grandpa is... you see, he is...

482
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:19,292
Rusk, Mattias gave his life for the
freedom of Cherry Valley.

483
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:39,792
We can't mourn our dead, or celebrate
our freedom as long as Katla exists.

484
01:34:39,958 --> 01:34:44,708
Give me the horn, and I'll shackle Katla
in her cave!

485
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:53,875
No, I must do it. As long as I've got
this, I have nothing to be afraid of.

486
01:34:54,042 --> 01:35:00,292
- I'll see you all in Cherry Valley.
- We'll see you too, I hope.

487
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:13,667
Katla has gone this way.

488
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:23,250
[Blowing the horn]

489
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:08,625
She's found her way to the Katla Cave.

490
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:32,500
[Blowing the horn]

491
01:36:53,167 --> 01:36:57,833
- The horn!
- What shall we do now?

492
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:05,542
Come, we must leave.

493
01:37:20,542 --> 01:37:23,708
Katla!

494
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,375
We can't get any further.

495
01:37:48,542 --> 01:37:51,125
Come on!

496
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:25,917
Don't you touch Rusk, you monster!
Don't you touch him!

497
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,167
Get the torch, Rusk.

498
01:39:13,417 --> 01:39:21,208
There are fairytales here that shouldn't
be... now you know what I meant.

499
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:28,250
I don't have a grandpa anymore...

500
01:39:28,417 --> 01:39:35,917
- Where do you think Mattias is, right now?
- He's in Nangilima.

501
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:41,583
- That's where Mattias is, right now.
- Yes.

502
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:47,917
I know...
He lives on a little farm in Apel Valley.

503
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:54,083
It's season there now, for picking apples.
We ought to be there to help him.

504
01:39:54,250 --> 01:40:00,750
He's too old to climb ladders.
We could stay at his house...

505
01:40:00,917 --> 01:40:08,792
...on the Mattis Farm...
in Apel Valley...in Nangilima...

506
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:13,625
...and help him with the apples.

507
01:40:15,417 --> 01:40:19,583
What is it, Jonathan?

508
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:28,333
It's getting dark.

509
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:34,667
Build a campfire.

510
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:43,083
Karl Lionheart...

511
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:54,917
Rusk... there's something i
need to tell you.

512
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:58,208
What?

513
01:41:02,833 --> 01:41:10,417
Katla burned me.
I'll soon be completely paralyzed.

514
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:18,125
I can't move my legs... and soon I
won't be able to move my arms either.

515
01:41:18,292 --> 01:41:25,125
Don't you think it'll pass,
if you just get some rest?

516
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:29,958
No, Rusk. It'll never pass.

517
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:39,083
Only if I could get to Nangilima.

518
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:44,958
If you get to Nangilima,
will you be alright?

519
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:53,417
Do you remember...

520
01:41:53,583 --> 01:41:57,958
...when the house was burning,
and we jumped?

521
01:41:58,125 --> 01:42:03,125
And I carried you on my back,
and I went to Nangijala.

522
01:42:03,292 --> 01:42:08,500
I'll never forget that.

523
01:42:08,667 --> 01:42:13,000
I was thinking...

524
01:42:13,167 --> 01:42:17,083
...that maybe we should jump
one more time.

525
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:21,458
You and me...

526
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:25,792
...from the cliff over there.

527
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:33,750
Will we get to Nangilima if we do?

528
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:38,250
Yes...

529
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:45,250
Think about it,
we can jump all the way to Nangilima.

530
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:51,000
Mattias will be very surprised.

531
01:42:51,167 --> 01:42:58,542
- What about Grim and Fjalar?
- They're already waiting for us
in Nangilima.

532
01:42:58,708 --> 01:43:05,750
They died of Katla's fire.
Only their shells remain.

533
01:43:05,917 --> 01:43:11,083
Jonathan, I'll carry you on my back.

534
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:18,000
You did it for me once.
This'll make it fair.

535
01:43:21,667 --> 01:43:26,667
- Will you dare, Rusk Lionheart?
- Yes.

536
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:32,917
If I may stay with you, until
darkness falls.

537
01:43:35,708 --> 01:43:40,875
I'll dare, otherwise
I'm just a piece of dirt.

538
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:52,542
Rusk Lionheart... are you afraid?

539
01:43:52,708 --> 01:43:57,292
No...

540
01:43:57,458 --> 01:44:06,708
Yes, but I'll do it anyway. I'll do
it now, and I'll never be afraid anymore.

541
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:15,042
I see the light! Jonathan!

542
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:21,458
Nangilima!
I see the light! I see the light!

543
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:27,292
[Hooves clappering]
