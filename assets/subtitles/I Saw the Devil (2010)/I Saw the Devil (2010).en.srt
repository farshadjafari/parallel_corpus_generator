Translation by Sejin Nam

2
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,400
I saw the father and the nun today at the church.

3
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Well, I've done this often.

4
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,099
I love kids here.

5
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,949
If I have a baby I should raise him in a place like this.

6
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,542
Because here we have wild flowers and trees to see.

7
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,236
Also it's close to Seoul.

8
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,414
Uh? Towing car?

9
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,216
They said it might take a while to get here.

10
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,823
Hum~ I love hearing your voice now.

11
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:57,050
Since I can hear your voice and it's snowing now,

12
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,335
the ambience in my car is livened up.

13
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,585
Just a second.

14
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,924
Does your tire have an air leak?

15
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,099
Yes. I called the towing car.

16
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,026
It will take a long time to get here since it's snowing.

17
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,492
Let me check your tire.

18
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,471
He said he would check the tire.

19
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,076
Really?

20
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,627
I think you should just wait for the towing car.

21
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,324
Uh? No, it's not hard to
change the tire.

22
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,499
Um? It's strange.

23
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,072
You told him you called the towing car but the guy wants to check your tire.

24
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:55,721
Wait, wait.

25
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,199
What's the status?

26
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,379
OK.

27
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,887
Hello? Jooyeon, I think I should head out now.

28
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,858
Don't open the car door and just wait for
the towing car.

29
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,425
Uh?

30
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:18,947
Wait.

31
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:34,978
My love~

32
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:38,630
so sweet~

33
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,295
I just~

34
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,415
I, I just don't like him checking the tire even though you told him you called the towing car.

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,386
Well, there are people around here.

36
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,322
Ha...I'm sorry. I couldn't be with you for your birthday.

37
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,476
Ok. I'll be there soon.

38
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,351
Um.

39
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,744
Your car's completely sunk.

40
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,891
Thank you for your help but I think I should just wait for the towing car.

41
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,483
Thank you so much

42
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:32,230
I Saw The Devil.

43
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,620
Mister. Mister. Mister

44
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,528
It's going to be easy since your skin is so soft.

45
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:32,534
Can you please not kill me?

46
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,164
Why?

47
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,448
I...

48
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,799
have a baby in my belly.

49
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,338
Spare my life, please.

50
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,258
Dongsoo! Dongsoo!

51
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,058
What?

52
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,698
Come over here! Hurry Up!

53
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:45,629
Boss! Why did you come out here?

54
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,834
We can let you know the situation later if you stay at home.

55
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:54,048
What happened? What happened to my daughter?

56
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,562
Don't look. Not now.

57
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,219
We don't know yet.

58
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:32,644
Detective Joh.

59
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:34,835
Here.

60
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,029
Is this?

61
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:38,981
Let me see.

62
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:44,303
It looks like hair. Flip it over.

63
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,073
Forensic team!

64
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,744
here, here! come here hurry!

65
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:20,122
We found it. we found it over here.

66
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:07,832
God helped us.

67
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,672
Otherwise we wouldn't be able to find her.

68
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:23,753
It's funny how the father couldn't protect his own daughter

69
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:28,237
even though he has been a detective in charge of violent crime for more than 30 years.

70
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,096
Please stop smoking sir.

71
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,750
I'm sorry.

72
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:58,893
I'm really sorry.

73
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:11,604
To you and to my Jooyeon.

74
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:22,500
I am terribly sorry.

75
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,750
I'm sorry Jooyeon.

76
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,160
I couldn't keep the promise.

77
00:21:56,652 --> 00:22:01,542
I was late and couldn't keep the promise.

78
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,314
But Jooyeon,

79
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,361
I'll promise this.

80
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:20,563
I'll give him the pain that's 1000 times,

81
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,420
no, 10000 times more painful.

82
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,820
Soohyun.

83
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,888
So how long do you want?

84
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:21,971
Since there's nothing urgent to do, you can rest for a few months.

85
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:23,587
2 weeks is enough.

86
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,140
You can rest longer.

87
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,011
No, I'll come back to work after 2 weeks.

88
00:23:30,252 --> 00:23:33,429
Well, I really appreciate if you can do that.

89
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:36,266
But are you going to be OK?

90
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:46,893
Alright.

91
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:50,310
Then I'll be expecting you after 2 weeks.

92
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:53,132
In the meantime, please rest fully.

93
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,959
I can't believe this happened to us.

94
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,300
They just got engaged less than a month ago.

95
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,523
What a crazy world.

96
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:19,717
You're here.

97
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,500
Here's the GPS,

98
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,051
and the capsule.

99
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,155
There are a GPS and a voice mic inside here.

100
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,675
Isn't it marvelous?

101
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,085
Good job.

102
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,422
Thank you.

103
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,877
You're welcome.

104
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:49,432
Aren't you going in?

105
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:50,221
Yes?

106
00:24:51,147 --> 00:24:53,348
Isn't there anything to say?

107
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,224
No.

108
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:02,563
Well, I trust you
but if there's going to be any problem,

109
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:07,189
you and I can get into a serious trouble since I siphoned them off from other division.

110
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,439
Don't worry.

111
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:12,368
I'll make sure there's no problem.

112
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:31,301
The police suspects those four.

113
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:37,349
They were the suspects when there were similar cases before.

114
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:42,209
Soohyun, you're here.

115
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:43,700
Yeah.

116
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:46,859
Do you want to have supper?

117
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:49,030
No, I have to leave now.

118
00:25:49,945 --> 00:25:51,968
I went grocery shopping for dad.

119
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,759
I'll get going now.

120
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,462
Don't see me off outside.

121
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:00,035
Are you leaving?

122
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,115
Yes.

123
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:28,862
Why isn't this bastard moving a single muscle?

124
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:33,922
Yes.

125
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,394
There's no suspicious move yet.

126
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,647
Yes.

127
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,073
Yes sir.

128
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:43,845
This guy's the dirtiest pervert, I swear.

129
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:10,479
Quite.

130
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,560
Do you remember this?

131
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:21,240
You really don't know?

132
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,055
I see.

133
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,391
Who the fuck is he?

134
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,707
Why is he looking so bruised?

135
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,145
Why is he turning himself in?

136
00:28:51,285 --> 00:28:55,357
Two months ago, there was a dead teenage girl's body in Bang-Ho river, he said
he did that girl.

137
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:58,566
He confessed that missing Shin-Chun high school girl was his job few years ago too.

138
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:01,984
What the hell is wrong with him?

139
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:03,238
Why does he have so many bruises?

140
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:05,121
Who did this? Did you guys do it?

141
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:12,403
No. All of a sudden paramedics came and went upstairs and found him almost dead like this.

142
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:14,655
Then who did this? He injured himself?

143
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,780
He didn't explain that part yet.

144
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,142
What the, hey what happened to you last night?

145
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:29,682
What the hell is he saying?

146
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:35,251
It looks like some guy hit his penis with a hammer badly.

147
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:38,593
Hey! What nonsense.

148
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:42,134
Hey retard, who hit your penis?

149
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,186
Who the fuck are you?

150
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:23,349
Hey you motherfucker!

151
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:20,115
There's no more bus at this time.

152
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:22,125
Where are you going?

153
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:23,894
Pardon me?

154
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,855
I said where are you going.

155
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,272
Sungmin apartment.

156
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,707
Sungmin?

157
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:34,065
Since it's not too far from here I can give you a ride.

158
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:36,230
I can take you there.

159
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:37,692
No thanks.

160
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:40,488
I can take you there.

161
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:41,910
It's OK.

162
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:46,240
Sungmin apartment is very close to here.

163
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:57,224
It's OK.

164
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:03,492
Are you sure?

165
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,144
Yeah, it's OK.

166
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:08,753
Get in the car.

167
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:28,795
What?

168
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:31,929
Yes? Nothing.

169
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,896
Is this an after-school academic bus?

170
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:06,052
Where did I leave it?

171
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:41,041
What?

172
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:43,923
Yes?

173
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,329
Why are you looking so scared?

174
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:51,353
Haven't you seen this before?

175
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:10,626
Who are you?

176
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:31,304
By the way, why do you need these to get the insurance money?

177
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:35,619
First of all, I need to make sure your son is my policyholder, Gyeongchul Jang,

178
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,853
since there are many people with the same name.

179
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:41,402
These are all old pictures.

180
00:37:51,932 --> 00:37:55,635
Maybe you can recognize him in this picture.

181
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,728
I'll ask few more questions.

182
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:07,914
Is there any other way to contact him now?

183
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,012
I don't know but his son might know how to contact him.

184
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:16,226
Sanghoon! Sanghoon!

185
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:18,516
Where is he?

186
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:27,018
Yangpyeong? Chungpyeong? I think.

187
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:33,398
Lastly I want to check if your son is the one that I'm looking for.

188
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:40,697
Is this Gyeongchul Jang?

189
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,757
He is Gyeongchul.

190
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:52,329
Was this picture taken recently?

191
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:59,510
How come he looks so scary in this picture?

192
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:02,065
Insurance my ass.

193
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:07,416
He insured the family?

194
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:12,012
He left us and his son and never came back!

195
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:14,929
Now you think he has an insurance on our names?

196
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:17,815
That's nonsense!

197
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:18,856
Why are you saying that?

198
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:23,378
Am I wrong? Do you still think he's our son?

199
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:27,893
He's good for nothing!

200
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:31,079
Please shut your mouth and snap out of it.

201
00:39:31,222 --> 00:39:32,795
Why are you saying that?

202
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:35,297
It's not appropriate to say stuff like that.

203
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:37,090
Fuck, whatever.

204
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,153
By the way, if the policyholder is dead or missing,

205
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:50,818
does his family get the money?

206
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,719
Are you Sanghoon?

207
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:28,414
Do you know where your father lives now?

208
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:37,376
Shit. Why you ask?

209
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:07,871
You guys don't go anywhere but home now. Alright?

210
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,952
Yes.

211
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,291
Driver, please don't let them out elsewhere.

212
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:16,092
Yeah.

213
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,378
Thank you.

214
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,177
Who are you?

215
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:05,242
Is Gyeongchul Jang here?

216
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,003
Why do you ask that?

217
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:08,860
We're the police. Where is he?

218
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:11,280
He is driving our kids to their home now.

219
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:13,780
Can you call him right now? Please?

220
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:04,556
What? One girl is missing?

221
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,596
What were you guys doing?

222
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:08,454
How come you guys didn't notice Gyeongchul Jang leaving the house?

223
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,405
You guys were asleep while staking out, right?

224
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,548
How come you guys missed him?

225
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,025
You're reporting back to me that shit happens?

226
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:17,860
You guys were all at the front of the house, right?

227
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:19,311
What were you guys doing there?

228
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:20,702
Did you guys plan to catch him after greeting him?

229
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,414
What a bunch of retards.

230
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:23,501
Now listen.

231
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,840
We need to watch every corner of the after-school academy and we must find Gyeongchul Jang first.

232
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,548
We don't need a fucking warrant.

233
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:32,027
We just gotta catch him, got it?

234
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:35,447
Mark my words: He is the murderer

235
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:37,461
Go catch him!

236
00:46:42,405 --> 00:46:43,268
It's me.

237
00:46:43,728 --> 00:46:47,411
I just got home to get changed but I don't think I have enough time to get changed now.

238
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:49,485
So...where are you going?

239
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:50,440
To my friend's place.

240
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,255
Friend? Who?

241
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:52,530
Do you know any of my friends?

242
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:53,193
What?

243
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:55,592
Do you just want to take the clothes or do you want to get changed now?

244
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:56,713
No I don't have time.

245
00:46:56,858 --> 00:46:57,731
Just give me the clothes.

246
00:46:57,909 --> 00:46:58,717
No I wasn't talking to you.

247
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:00,757
Why are you going to friend's place at this time?

248
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,088
To study!

249
00:47:02,628 --> 00:47:04,110
Why are you studing at your friend's place?

250
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,597
Why are you nagging me now?

251
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:09,931
Are you talking back to me? Come over here!

252
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:10,771
No!

253
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:12,224
Look at this girl!

254
00:47:13,516 --> 00:47:15,342
What are you doing now? Hurry up and go.

255
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:56,141
Let me see.

256
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:34,952
Ah..your skin is so pale.

257
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:41,735
It's OK, it's OK.

258
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,358
I'll finish it real quick.

259
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:52,045
It looks like I can't fucking drive the academic bus anymore.

260
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:56,231
Things are fucking getting twisted now.

261
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:06,545
But shit, can't I like you?

262
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,458
I can like you, right?

263
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:14,045
It's totally OK that I like you.

264
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:19,331
Then why the fuck does everybody in this world give me so much shit, huh?

265
00:49:20,396 --> 00:49:21,536
Why is that?

266
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:37,027
I'll finish it real quick.

267
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:55,385
Gyeongchul Jang.

268
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,371
What? Are you alone?

269
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:52,880
Are you a cop?

270
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:09,284
I see you're a cop.

271
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:18,545
How come the Korean police found me so quickly?

272
00:52:20,402 --> 00:52:22,141
I'm so surprised.

273
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:29,402
I guess you still don't know who I am now.

274
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:34,500
Well, what do I expect from the Korean police?

275
00:52:36,425 --> 00:52:38,246
That's that.

276
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,592
You shithead!

277
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:32,980
Fuck you!

278
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,699
What, what the hell is this guy?

279
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:07,599
This guy's a fucking psycho.

280
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:06,490
Fucking asshole.

281
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:52,487
Hello sir.

282
00:58:52,706 --> 00:58:57,039
I don't know where you are headed but you can take this taxi.

283
00:58:58,257 --> 00:58:59,304
Aren't you getting in?

284
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,096
There are no more taxis at this time.

285
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:07,898
How come you decided to walk this road alone?

286
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,909
But you're lucky that you got the taxi here.

287
00:59:15,284 --> 00:59:17,407
The customer in the back seat is also heading in the same direction.

288
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,304
You're OK going with this gentleman right?

289
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,146
Sure.

290
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,501
Anyway it must've been really hard for you to catch the taxi.

291
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:44,177
You can hardly see a taxi around here at this time.

292
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:46,791
I rarely even drive here.

293
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,778
Only once in a while I come here for work.

294
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:54,393
But you gentlemen are so lucky today.

295
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,038
You know that?

296
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:03,309
Recently there have been so many bad incidents around this area that I can get no customers here.

297
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:07,534
But today I have two customers here.

298
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:11,726
Come to think of it, I am also lucky today.

299
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:13,516
Ain't I sir?

300
01:00:20,465 --> 01:00:23,695
Where were you gentlemen going in such a dark place?

301
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:43,681
Sir? Did something good happen to you today sir?

302
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:45,014
Mister.

303
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:46,416
Yes?

304
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,900
You said we're all lucky today.

305
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,126
That's what I said.

306
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,730
Why?

307
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:06,746
But I think you're very unlucky today.

308
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:35,782
Crazy retards.

309
01:04:12,592 --> 01:04:14,655
Your bones will be attached soon since you're young.

310
01:04:15,157 --> 01:04:16,940
Don't worry about it.

311
01:04:17,594 --> 01:04:22,898
How did you break your wrist playing soccer?

312
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,344
Did you play soccer with your fists?

313
01:04:27,628 --> 01:04:30,661
Anyway, from now on take it slowly. Got it?

314
01:04:37,382 --> 01:04:38,059
It's done.

315
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:39,927
You can leave.

316
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,460
Hey you motherfucker.

317
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,657
Am I your son?

318
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,563
Then why do you talk down on me?

319
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,969
Take off your glasses.

320
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,085
Take off your glasses.

321
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,820
Come here.

322
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:18,099
Come over here.

323
01:05:18,231 --> 01:05:22,208
Sir? You can come outside now.

324
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:24,387
You need to take the prescription.

325
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:35,603
How old are you?

326
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,755
I'm 22.

327
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:43,025
Must be nice being 22.

328
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:45,596
Boyfriend?

329
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,655
Pardon me?

330
01:05:49,536 --> 01:05:53,143
You look like you have many boyfriends. Right?

331
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,106
No. I don't have a boyfriend.

332
01:05:58,641 --> 01:06:00,847
Don't fucking lie to me.

333
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:06,275
How come a cutie like you doesn't have a boyfriend?

334
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:12,789
You don't know 'IT.'

335
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:16,057
Excuse me?

336
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,637
If you don't know 'IT' then you can hardly know men.

337
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:44,909
Yesterday I was going to have some fun but some asshole spoiled everything.

338
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:54,362
So this time I want everything to go smoothly with you.

339
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:24,819
Take off your clothes.

340
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:27,453
Uh?

341
01:08:32,837 --> 01:08:35,110
Take off your clothes yourself.

342
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,657
Since we're going to do it, you should enjoy it too, right?

343
01:08:42,213 --> 01:08:44,210
So take off your clothes.

344
01:09:03,175 --> 01:09:06,672
Take them off before I put scars on your face with a knife, bitch.

345
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:14,840
I said take them off quickly you bitch!

346
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,461
That's right.

347
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,438
Take off your bra too. Hurry up.

348
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:35,231
Please don't kill me.

349
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:52,005
That's it. Take off your skirt too.

350
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:26,760
You son of a bitch.

351
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:31,076
Who the hell are you, you fucking bitch?

352
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:27,875
Wait.

353
01:13:28,876 --> 01:13:30,146
Don't leave now.

354
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,144
I need to treat you immediately.

355
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:36,707
Why are you pretending to be so weak?

356
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:38,452
It's just the beginning.

357
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,190
Remember this.

358
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:46,201
It is going to be more terrible.

359
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,798
Close your eyes now.

360
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,494
Turn around and cover your ears too.

361
01:15:59,525 --> 01:16:03,750
Hey fuck you, crazy ass motherfucker, shit!

362
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:12,021
Ha! Son of a bitch!

363
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,652
You want to do this to me huh?

364
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,680
Hey you son of a bitch! You really want to do this?

365
01:16:17,904 --> 01:16:19,787
Crazy motherfucker.

366
01:16:21,149 --> 01:16:25,372
Alright fucking shithead, let's see who's the top dog here.

367
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,908
What is it?

368
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,909
Has there been an accident?

369
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,373
Looks like something's wrong with the car.

370
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:16,086
Yes, sir.

371
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,886
Is everything OK with you?

372
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,756
I am just worried about you.

373
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:34,396
The police think that I'm after Gyeongchul Jang.

374
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:40,050
It seems like the police are also after Gyeongchul Jang.

375
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,891
So I was wondering....

376
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:51,502
if you can stop chasing him now.

377
01:19:51,503 --> 01:19:52,850
But I..

378
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:54,970
You've done enough.

379
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,067
I want you to stop it.

380
01:19:58,372 --> 01:20:00,222
But, sir...

381
01:20:11,989 --> 01:20:13,990
Nevermind.

382
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,795
I see. I'll hang up.

383
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:21,386
Soohyun, it's me.

384
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,596
Soohyun.

385
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:27,542
Yeah, how are you doing?

386
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,912
How are you doing Soohyun?

387
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:33,134
I'm just busy with my work now.

388
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:37,498
Really? What kind of work?

389
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:40,715
You know what I do.

390
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:45,127
I know what you do normally, but I don't know what you do secretly.

391
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:47,573
You got the criminal information from my dad already?

392
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:55,650
Soohyun, I understand how you feel, but I want you to stop it.

393
01:20:57,331 --> 01:20:59,996
My sister won't come
back even if you do this.

394
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:07,219
Even if you catch him, nothing changes.

395
01:21:08,725 --> 01:21:13,774
Revenge is something people do in a movie but this man is just crazy.

396
01:21:15,332 --> 01:21:18,653
I'm sorry but I have nothing to tell you.

397
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:21,019
What do you mean you have nothing to tell me?

398
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,323
Am I nobody to you?

399
01:21:26,823 --> 01:21:29,083
Do you know how I have been recently?

400
01:21:29,438 --> 01:21:33,905
Recently I started to check back a lot if anyone's following me.

401
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:39,286
Now you tell me you have nothing to tell me?

402
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,845
So I beg you now.

403
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:52,341
There's no meaning. Please stop it.

404
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,511
I'm sorry, I have to hang up now.

405
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:02,230
And this work is not meaningless.

406
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,636
Water.

407
01:22:54,699 --> 01:22:56,881
Give me water.

408
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:41,145
Do you remember the time when we first met each other?

409
01:23:42,565 --> 01:23:47,021
We wanted to organize a terrorist group and flip the world upside down.

410
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:53,259
I miss those days.

411
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:56,818
We got nothing to be afraid of.

412
01:23:57,149 --> 01:24:00,710
Talk about that shit later when your mom dies, and just give me a cigar now.

413
01:24:35,344 --> 01:24:38,298
He must be related to one of the dead girls.

414
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,520
Who the hell would do that if he's not.

415
01:24:46,568 --> 01:24:49,320
He joined our club too.

416
01:24:49,457 --> 01:24:53,819
He's enjoying it just like you feel excited when hunting.

417
01:24:55,988 --> 01:25:01,000
Catch it and release it. Catch it and release it.

418
01:25:01,001 --> 01:25:02,993
He's playing
the hunting game now.

419
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:12,738
It looks like you got caught really bad this time.

420
01:25:17,005 --> 01:25:21,438
This guy went crazy after losing his bitch.

421
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,708
Monster appeared.

422
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:27,725
It's funny.

423
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,613
Go to bed, you must be tired now.

424
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,423
There are a lot of vacant rooms.

425
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:51,777
You can sleep in any room.

426
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,439
And I will prepare breakfast for tomorrow.

427
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:17,309
Fucking assholes.

428
01:26:52,699 --> 01:26:55,208
Let go. Let go of me!

429
01:27:07,752 --> 01:27:09,661
Fuck you, asshole.

430
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,793
Shit, you guys are fucking crazy.

431
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,676
Little bit more, little bit more.

432
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,056
One more time.

433
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,840
He's enjoying it just like you feel excited when hunting.

434
01:29:00,845 --> 01:29:04,867
Catch it and release it. Catch it and release it.

435
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:07,188
He's enjoying to see his prey in pain.

436
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,498
He's playing the hunting game now.

437
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,786
It's going to be more terrible.

438
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,502
It's fun.

439
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,497
Don't do that.

440
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:52,179
Didn't you see Miyeon last night?

441
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:58,324
If you resist, it's more painful and takes longer.

442
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:04,658
It'll be done quickly.

443
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:06,948
So bear with me for a little bit.

444
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,592
Then why did you suspect us? Uh?

445
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,090
Did we ask for a house or money?

446
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:20,432
We just wanted to stay here for a few days but why you guys give us shit!

447
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:24,847
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

448
01:31:29,963 --> 01:31:34,582
You should've said that earlier. Uh!

449
01:31:36,248 --> 01:31:43,515
You retards always do that after shit happens.

450
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:48,564
Wait, wait, the order is arms, legs, and head. Right?

451
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:52,960
Close your eyes. It's better not to see it.

452
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,770
Where is she?

453
01:33:06,725 --> 01:33:08,462
How did you come inside without making any noise?

454
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,453
I have a baby in my belly.

455
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,842
I was curious what you looked like.

456
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:57,259
I see you don't look like a monster.

457
01:33:59,445 --> 01:34:01,784
Crazy asshole.

458
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,548
The order is arms, legs and head. Right?

459
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,106
I'll do exactly the same as how you guys did.

460
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,010
Don't worry about it, I won't do more than that.

461
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,965
You crazy psycho fuckers.

462
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,435
I am actually relieved right now.

463
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:39,067
I was worried that something might've happened to you.

464
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,088
He is Soohyun Kim from NIS (National Intelligence Service), right?

465
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,881
Do you want to see what he has been up to?

466
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:56,506
Please make him stop it.

467
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,171
You can't become a monster to fight against a monster.

468
01:42:03,449 --> 01:42:06,220
You're worried about him too, right?

469
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:10,032
Where is he now?

470
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:13,676
You should be OK since I treated you immediately.

471
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:21,871
Do you know you and he slept for 2 days without waking up?

472
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:26,462
What happened?

473
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:33,287
Why don't you just hand him over to the police?

474
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,835
Not yet.

475
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,872
What are you gonna do?

476
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:49,430
Do you know what it feels like to have a huge rock in your chest?

477
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,712
That feeling...

478
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:58,685
I promised something to Jooyeon.

479
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:03,394
I will pay him back for what he's done.

480
01:43:06,043 --> 01:43:07,595
Not yet.

481
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,944
It's still far from the end.

482
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:18,456
Alright. I will ask you no more.

483
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:23,802
By the way, the capsule is really good, right? Unless he has constipation,

484
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:33,658
He knocked out after I gave him one strong shot.

485
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,203
I don't think he will wake up until tomorrow.

486
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:49,771
Soohyun, do you know you look so different now?

487
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,768
Hello.

488
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:28,355
Can I have a painkiller with Dexibuprofen ingredient?

489
01:45:28,475 --> 01:45:31,500
What? Dexi what?

490
01:45:31,759 --> 01:45:32,905
Give the strongest one.

491
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:34,318
OK.

492
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:39,251
Where are you now?

493
01:45:39,451 --> 01:45:41,252
It looks like you're not around.

494
01:45:41,646 --> 01:45:46,500
Hey, are you listening? Of course you are.

495
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:50,274
This is really fun! Uh?

496
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:55,132
I never had this kind of fun before in my life.

497
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:00,791
Hey, I know who you are.

498
01:46:01,449 --> 01:46:06,546
Your girlfriend was Jooyeon Jang who lived in Yeonyi county. Right?

499
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,841
Am I correct?

500
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,992
I want you to know that you made a mistake.

501
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:17,051
You underestimated me.

502
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:20,748
you'll regret that you didn't kill me when you had a chance.

503
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,097
It doesn't even take much time to kill someone.

504
01:46:23,186 --> 01:46:24,092
Hello.

505
01:46:24,512 --> 01:46:29,630
You'll see. I'll teach you how pain really feels.

506
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:34,484
Hey, excuse me!

507
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:47,199
By the way, before I killed her, she told me that she was pregnant

508
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:50,509
and begged for her life.

509
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:55,252
Did you know that?

510
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,965
Hu-Hu-Hu-Hu-Hurry up you asshole.

511
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,104
Otherwise, that woman will die.

512
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:13,488
You should've been around me since you let me stay alive.

513
01:50:16,524 --> 01:50:20,766
Shit, do we have to do this to save them?

514
01:50:22,042 --> 01:50:26,643
Sometimes when I look at assholes like them, I don't want to be a human.

515
01:50:26,743 --> 01:50:29,809
Call me when they wake up.

516
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:39,056
What is this again?

517
01:50:39,243 --> 01:50:41,756
So what?

518
01:50:43,943 --> 01:50:49,216
Really? Is that for real?

519
01:50:51,342 --> 01:50:53,351
I got it.

520
01:50:54,743 --> 01:50:58,456
Hey, Gyeongchul Jang is turning himself in.

521
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:02,219
You made a mistake, you son of a bitch.

522
01:51:55,243 --> 01:51:57,350
Wake up.

523
01:52:07,542 --> 01:52:10,305
I want to ask you something.

524
01:52:10,342 --> 01:52:14,734
Where would your friend go?

525
01:52:25,993 --> 01:52:31,436
You shouldn't have gotten on his nerves.

526
01:52:32,143 --> 01:52:37,533
He pays back what he got.

527
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:42,083
Do you know what I mean?

528
01:52:44,679 --> 01:52:50,096
Your girl, your girl's family, uh?

529
01:52:53,042 --> 01:52:59,462
After that if he turns himself in, it's all done.

530
01:53:00,743 --> 01:53:08,932
But your girl must not have felt so bad.

531
01:53:08,943 --> 01:53:18,248
Unlike me, he gives pleasure before he gives pain.

532
01:53:20,743 --> 01:53:24,993
He gives pleasure first.

533
01:53:27,443 --> 01:53:32,527
Funny? Is that really funny?

534
01:53:34,292 --> 01:53:36,792
That really makes you smile?

535
01:53:45,542 --> 01:53:51,590
Alright, I'll make you smile for the rest of your life.

536
01:53:57,342 --> 01:53:59,650
I wiretapped a call from Gyeongchul Jang.

537
01:53:59,943 --> 01:54:03,389
I was wiretapping the police communication because I was worried about you.

538
01:54:03,842 --> 01:54:07,207
Just a few moments ago Gyeongchul Jang called the police and said he wants to turn himself in.

539
01:54:07,243 --> 01:54:10,582
But before he does that, he said he wants to finish some business.

540
01:54:10,743 --> 01:54:13,233
Is he gonna do it again?

541
01:54:13,243 --> 01:54:14,682
What location did you wiretap the call from?

542
01:54:14,693 --> 01:54:16,546
Yeonyi County.

543
01:55:03,743 --> 01:55:04,931
Detective Joh?

544
01:55:07,243 --> 01:55:08,913
This is Soohyun Kim.

545
01:55:09,542 --> 01:55:10,578
What?

546
01:55:11,342 --> 01:55:14,431
Why did you make things worse and let this happen?

547
01:55:14,943 --> 01:55:20,667
You're a dead man if anything happens to him. Got it?

548
01:55:21,193 --> 01:55:23,582
Fucking answer me!

549
01:55:27,243 --> 01:55:33,743
Tell the other teams to go to detective Jang's place and turn the car around. Hurry up!

550
01:57:33,743 --> 01:57:35,393
Look alike?

551
01:57:35,443 --> 01:57:37,193
No.

552
01:57:37,194 --> 01:57:40,658
Jooyeon must take after her mom.

553
01:57:41,542 --> 01:57:45,131
Thank God she doesn't take after her dad.

554
01:57:49,193 --> 01:57:52,632
Then why did you charge toward me like crazy?

555
01:57:52,643 --> 01:57:55,537
Are you crazy? Crazy?

556
01:57:57,743 --> 01:57:59,842
Let me see.

557
01:57:59,943 --> 01:58:03,721
Shit, where is it?

558
01:58:04,631 --> 01:58:09,087
What would make that motherfucker get angry?

559
01:58:09,993 --> 01:58:11,872
Would he get mad if I do this?

560
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:16,496
Like this? Like this? Like this?

561
01:58:17,045 --> 01:58:23,953
Like this, crazy motherfucker. Like this, you son of a bitch.

562
02:00:20,243 --> 02:00:21,432
You can't come inside here.

563
02:00:21,542 --> 02:00:23,530
You cannot.

564
02:00:32,943 --> 02:00:34,724
What is it?

565
02:00:34,743 --> 02:00:37,818
Let go of him.

566
02:00:38,342 --> 02:00:42,322
Are you Soohyun Kim?

567
02:00:46,342 --> 02:00:48,050
You bastard!

568
02:00:48,185 --> 02:00:49,238
Come over here!

569
02:00:49,243 --> 02:00:54,238
Do you have any idea what you have done? How dare you show up here!

570
02:00:54,243 --> 02:00:56,938
You worthless, crazy bastard!

571
02:00:56,943 --> 02:01:00,542
Let go. Let go of me.

572
02:01:03,943 --> 02:01:07,743
What a rootless bastard.

573
02:01:10,743 --> 02:01:12,438
Stay out of the way.

574
02:01:12,443 --> 02:01:14,520
Out of the way.

575
02:02:57,342 --> 02:02:58,537
Hello?

576
02:02:58,542 --> 02:03:00,750
This is Gyeongchul Jang.

577
02:03:01,443 --> 02:03:03,961
You bastard.

578
02:03:05,743 --> 02:03:08,600
Where are you now?

579
02:03:08,842 --> 02:03:12,233
You, you didn't do anything to Saeyeon. Right?

580
02:03:12,342 --> 02:03:15,167
You can find out later.

581
02:03:19,743 --> 02:03:22,360
What?

582
02:03:47,292 --> 02:03:48,493
Hello.

583
02:03:58,743 --> 02:04:01,175
How do you feel? Can you feel it now?

584
02:04:01,643 --> 02:04:07,014
Why did you fucking start chasing me you ignorant fucking asshole.

585
02:04:07,643 --> 02:04:09,625
Who do you think won?

586
02:04:10,592 --> 02:04:13,819
You or me?

587
02:05:40,693 --> 02:05:43,202
Gyeongchul Jang, Gyeongchul Jang!

588
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,810
Gyeongchul Jang showed up!

589
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:48,588
Wait for my command.

590
02:06:50,743 --> 02:06:52,585
Now!

591
02:06:57,042 --> 02:06:58,576
Hurry up!

592
02:07:03,342 --> 02:07:05,182
Stop that car! Stop it!

593
02:07:08,542 --> 02:07:09,877
Catch him!

594
02:07:20,042 --> 02:07:21,997
Catch! Catch!

595
02:07:27,443 --> 02:07:29,412
Hey!

596
02:08:40,842 --> 02:08:43,777
Yes, you're right.

597
02:08:45,842 --> 02:08:48,301
I was wrong.

598
02:08:54,592 --> 02:08:58,104
I underestimated you.

599
02:09:12,243 --> 02:09:15,630
From now on, I will not go easy on you.

600
02:09:21,695 --> 02:09:23,466
You son of a bitch, what are you doing?

601
02:09:23,594 --> 02:09:27,895
What are you doing?

602
02:09:28,493 --> 02:09:30,337
It's just the beginning.

603
02:09:30,342 --> 02:09:32,623
Why cry like a baby already?

604
02:09:35,155 --> 02:09:37,525
You son of a bitch.

605
02:09:38,542 --> 02:09:40,711
Son of a bitch, kill me already.

606
02:09:40,889 --> 02:09:42,797
Kill me already, son of a bitch.

607
02:09:43,072 --> 02:09:44,882
Kill me now bitch!

608
02:09:46,045 --> 02:09:48,300
Son of a bitch. Kill me already.

609
02:09:48,743 --> 02:09:53,087
Kill me already, son of a bitch. Kill me already!

610
02:10:01,143 --> 02:10:05,439
No. Not yet. Wait more.

611
02:10:08,542 --> 02:10:13,822
Think about it. If I was to kill you I would've already killed you before.

612
02:10:15,743 --> 02:10:19,885
I will kill you when you are in the most pain.

613
02:10:20,943 --> 02:10:28,832
When you're in the most pain shivering out of fear, then I will kill you.

614
02:10:31,743 --> 02:10:41,518
That's real revenge. Real, complete revenge.

615
02:10:50,443 --> 02:10:53,737
Spare, spare my life.

616
02:10:54,342 --> 02:11:03,811
Spare, spare, spare, spare my life.

617
02:11:11,342 --> 02:11:17,742
You heard that a lot, right? 'Spare my life.'

618
02:11:21,743 --> 02:11:24,301
You must've enjoyed hearing that a lot.

619
02:11:25,177 --> 02:11:30,337
Spare my life. Spare my life.

620
02:11:37,243 --> 02:11:42,881
I'll get punished.

621
02:11:45,243 --> 02:11:56,305
So, so spare my life, I've already had enough.

622
02:11:57,743 --> 02:12:05,583
Since I've already had enough, stop it.

623
02:12:18,943 --> 02:12:24,265
Please, please spare my life.

624
02:12:25,193 --> 02:12:31,381
I'm really sorry.

625
02:12:40,743 --> 02:12:46,944
Please, please spare my life.

626
02:13:04,243 --> 02:13:09,569
Are you scared?

627
02:13:11,193 --> 02:13:16,887
Tell me, now. Are you scared?

628
02:13:20,193 --> 02:13:27,792
Do you realize what you just did?

629
02:13:48,943 --> 02:13:58,051
You've played with me enough. So stop it, son of a bitch.

630
02:14:02,243 --> 02:14:08,470
Hey, stop talking bullshit now.

631
02:14:10,943 --> 02:14:15,983
You lost already.

632
02:14:16,342 --> 02:14:21,956
You think you've played with me till now.

633
02:14:24,342 --> 02:14:27,452
Bullshit.

634
02:14:28,743 --> 02:14:40,445
I don't know what pain is. Fear? Don't know that either.

635
02:14:41,842 --> 02:14:48,448
There's nothing you can get out of me.

636
02:14:54,943 --> 02:15:03,793
So, you lost already.

637
02:15:03,842 --> 02:15:07,192
You know that?

638
02:15:36,092 --> 02:15:44,399
I wish you still felt pain even after you die.

639
02:17:30,042 --> 02:17:31,692
Son of a bitch!

640
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:35,692
Fucking asshole, you die!

641
02:17:35,743 --> 02:17:40,337
Crazy bitch! I'll stay alive. I'll fucking stay alive.

642
02:17:40,343 --> 02:17:43,643
You son of a bitch, I will stay alive.

643
02:17:43,893 --> 02:17:46,743
Hey crazy, can you hear me?

644
02:17:46,893 --> 02:17:48,188
Are you listening to me?

645
02:17:48,192 --> 02:17:51,072
I am afraid of nothing.

646
02:17:54,442 --> 02:17:59,127
You crazy bitch. You think I'm bullshitting, right?

647
02:18:05,893 --> 02:18:11,056
Dad. Dad.

648
02:18:14,442 --> 02:18:19,692
Hey. Hey! Don't open the door.

649
02:18:19,743 --> 02:18:21,516
Dad.

650
02:18:25,075 --> 02:18:29,243
No, no, don't open the door.

651
02:18:29,743 --> 02:18:32,692
Sang-Hoon! Don't open the door.

652
02:18:32,743 --> 02:18:37,593
What the hell is he doing over there? Stay out of it.

653
02:18:38,243 --> 02:18:40,042
Don't open the door.

654
02:18:42,743 --> 02:18:44,733
How come it's not opening?

655
02:18:44,743 --> 02:18:48,797
No, no, fuck, why did you come here?

656
02:18:49,542 --> 02:18:50,638
Mom.

657
02:18:50,643 --> 02:18:52,192
Are you in there?

658
02:18:52,243 --> 02:18:55,692
No. Don't open the door.

659
02:18:55,743 --> 02:18:59,362
Don't fucking open the door and just go home.  Go home!

660
02:19:29,307 --> 02:19:36,736
Gyeongchul! Gyeongchul! Gyeongchul!
