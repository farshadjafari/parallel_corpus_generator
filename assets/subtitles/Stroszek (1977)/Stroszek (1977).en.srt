1
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,937
Right, let's begin.

2
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,251
- Release of Stroszek, Bruno.
- Correct.

3
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,175
OK, let's compare the lists - one jacket,
one pair of trousers, one jumper, one shirt.

4
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,252
- One pair of socks, one pair of shoes.
- Correct.

5
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,377
- One Scandalli accordion.
- Correct.

6
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,099
- Five packets of cigarettes.
- Hang on.

7
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,779
- Correct.
- One handkerchief.

8
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,379
- One passport.
- Correct.

9
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,054
- One bunch of keys.
- Correct.

10
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,975
And one bugle,
probably used by track workers.

11
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,051
Probably, yes.

12
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,052
- Right. Name?
- What?

13
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,974
- Name!
- Have you been dropped on the head?

14
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,212
You've known my name
for two and a half years.

15
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,139
Bruno, you know the formalities.
It’s silly, but what can you do?

16
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,692
- We have to do it.
- Stroszek. First name, Bruno.

17
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,775
Five foot six. Eye colour, brown.
Oval. No distinguishing features.

18
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,216
Fantastic.
Right, Bruno, let's get to the formalities.

19
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,734
- OK.
- First of all, your passport.

20
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,569
- Your money. Please check it later.
- OK.

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,297
- Your bugle.
- OK.

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,932
- Your accordion.
- It’s all there, as it should be.

23
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,056
Fantastic.

24
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,574
Bruno will now give a signal.

25
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,658
Because Bruno...

26
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,534
is now entering freedom.

27
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,852
You can have my television set as well now.

28
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,536
Bruno, look. I've made the smallest ship.

29
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,135
I've won. I’m giving it to you.

30
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,859
Ah, the smallest ship in the world.

31
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,900
I’ll take that home with me.

32
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,813
Bruno, listen,
I’ve got a farewell surprise for you, too.

33
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,854
But first I’ll have to set off a bomb.

34
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,533
I want you to have a surprise from me, too.

35
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,210
Right, Bruno, now watch.

36
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,730
Bruno...farewell.

37
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,129
Take care. See you outside.

38
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,452
- I don't want to leave.
- Good luck, Bruno. Good luck.

39
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,374
I won't see you again
because I have to go back to Turkey.

40
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,535
Bruno, come closer.

41
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,659
The time has come.
Today's the day of your release.

42
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,736
You can imagine that these moments
give me great pleasure in my job,

43
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,572
a job that entails a great deal
of disappointment and bitterness.

44
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,611
Before you leave our institution...

45
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,616
and return to freedom,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

46
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,930
Where are you going to live?

47
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,614
I live at 5 Flottwell Street.

48
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,090
My neighbour, Mr Scheitz,
has kept my flat for me.

49
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,250
One more thing, Bruno.

50
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,937
Do you still like your beer?

51
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,255
Yes.

52
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,731
Bruno, I have to have a very,
very serious talk with you about this.

53
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,134
All your offences go back to alcohol.
They're alcohol offences.

54
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,931
If the court ever
convicts you of another crime...

55
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,059
- Please be quiet, Bruno.
- Then he will be swept away.

56
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,773
It started with the homes,
and it ends with the prisons.

57
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,658
- He'll be swept away. Away, away, away.
- Bruno.

58
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,096
- Bruno, please be...
- Into the closed asylum.

59
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,489
Bruno, you're absolutely right.

60
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,018
Bruno, if you don't stop... Please be quiet
for a second. If you don't stop drinking...

61
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,013
- How can I be quiet about things like this?
- ..and if you commit any more crimes,

62
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,729
they'll say, ''Bruno is addicted,''
and put you in a detention centre.

63
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,492
- Away.
- Away, yes.

64
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,017
- Like this.
- Bruno, I'd like to give you... Look at me.

65
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,410
I'd like to give you some good advice.

66
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,459
Firstly,
if you should ever enter a pub, an inn,

67
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,612
then do as I would do
and order coffee and cake.

68
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,295
Secondly, dress properly.

69
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,536
Zip up your fly.
Make sure you wear decent clothes.

70
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,408
Look at yourself.
We've been working on you constantly.

71
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,176
Practise some personal hygiene.
Groom your face a little bit.

72
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,730
- And another thing...
- It’s going round in circles.

73
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,857
No, it isn't.
That's what I’m trying to prevent.

74
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,298
I never want to see you here again.
I want you to promise me something.

75
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,497
Promise that you will never
touch another drop of alcohol.

76
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,536
Cross my heart and hope to die.

77
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,533
Bruno, please hear me out
before you overexert yourself again.

78
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,898
There's one thing I ask of you.
Never touch another drop of alcohol.

79
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,531
And also, never set foot in a pub again.

80
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,178
Cross my heart and hope to die.

81
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,454
BEER
Heaven

82
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,337
- One beer, please.
- Oh, Bruno, you're back.

83
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,251
And here's Eva. Hello, Eva.

84
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,570
Get lost, you tramp.

85
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,259
Come on, come on.

86
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,778
- How dare you harass his blonde bimbo?
- I didn't.

87
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,215
George saw it, mate.

88
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,494
- You fucked her, didn't you?
- So what?

89
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,653
- What? Did you pay?
- No.

90
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,016
- You're her sugar daddy.
- What do you mean?

91
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,570
- You've bought her.
- Bernd said she had nothing to do with him.

92
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,572
I don't give a shit what Bernd said.

93
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,133
Burkhard,
don't leave me standing here like this.

94
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,690
Did you hear anything?
Did somebody just say something?

95
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,450
Burkhard, look how I’m crying.
Does it leave you cold?

96
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,491
- Got any savings?
- How could I have any savings?

97
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,459
- From your granny, perhaps?
- I had no idea about any of this.

98
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,498
- Who cares? Don't you have rich parents?
- No, I don't.

99
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,052
Don't you? But I’m sure your granny still
has some savings for her little nephew.

100
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,497
- How am I supposed to get the money?
- You can do a burglary, for all I care,

101
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,491
but you will cough up ten grand.

102
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,048
Burkhard, look at me crying.

103
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,098
Don't leave me standing here.
I want to stay with you.

104
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,856
- If you cry a lot, you need to piss less.
- But I really want to stay with you.

105
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,049
- Hey, you've got to tell us something.
- What should I tell you?

106
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,849
Hey, don't do anything stupid.
What are you doing?

107
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,738
There's no need to go over the top every
time, but this time it costs you ten grand.

108
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,298
And if you ever pull another trick like that,
it'll cost you 15.

109
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,009
And if you don't pay, I’ll stick a blade
up your arse, all the way up to your throat.

110
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,932
Is that clear?

111
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,179
Burkhard, please. Please.

112
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,375
Eva, come on, sit down. Sit down here.

113
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,336
Come on, sit down here.

114
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,292
It's all right.

115
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,135
Everything's going to be all right.

116
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,095
Where have you been, Bruno?

117
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,529
I was on holiday.

118
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,932
Where am I supposed to go now?
What am I supposed to do?

119
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,330
I've got a flat.

120
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,695
Mr Scheitz has kept the flat for me.

121
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,130
You can crash at mine.

122
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,894
I’m starting a new life today, anyway.

123
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,496
Exactly.

124
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,536
That's what we'll do.

125
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,531
Ah, this one works.
Now let's see what our black friend says.

126
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,772
Right, this is what I’ve got.

127
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,255
A romance.

128
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,248
Bruno, I’ve made you a cup of coffee.

129
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,933
A cup of coffee.

130
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,251
- This is the first cup of coffee that I...
- Perhaps we should...

131
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,810
- Without sugar or anything.
- We should put something under it.

132
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,371
- Oh, yes, you're right. No water stains.
- There are so many stains as it is.

133
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,337
Right, now the question is...

134
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,852
All my friends have waited for me.
This one is my best friend.

135
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,896
A black one.

136
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,610
What will become of it when Bruno dies?

137
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,458
Where will these things go?
Where will these instruments go?

138
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,054
What will become of them?

139
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,576
I’d like someone to give me
an answer to this question.

140
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,136
- Well, this grand piano is a little battered.
- Yes, it is.

141
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,975
There are stains on it,
and we don't know how to remove them.

142
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,818
I’ll see if I can pick up a few things
from home and earn some money.

143
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,452
Then I’m sure this place will be quite nice,
but you have to look after it a bit better.

144
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,015
Yes. Well, I’m here now, aren't I?

145
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,455
- The stains won't...
- This isn't working.

146
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,174
- Oh, Mr Scheitz.
- I’ve brought your good little mynah bird.

147
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,457
I’ve fed it and looked after it.

148
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,372
How nice that it's still alive.

149
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,137
Let's get it inside. it can't stay out here.

150
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,212
Bruno's got his heating on.

151
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,419
I’m getting to go to America in my old age.

152
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,335
My nephew wants me to come over.
He's already sent me a plane ticket.

153
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,333
But I don't fly.
Aeroplanes are all built the wrong way.

154
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,809
I’m going by boat.

155
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,333
Come here, come. Come here.

156
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,014
My, aren't you good at talking, mynah bird?

157
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,217
Well, taking a boat
to New York and Florida...

158
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,373
Isn't there a park there? What's it called?
Where the bears run around free.

159
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,212
That's the grizzlies.

160
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,058
- Come here.
- Judith.

161
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,895
- Eva. Eva.
- That's Eva.

162
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,819
- Eva.
- She's your new friend.

163
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,211
<i>A bird comes flying...</i>

164
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,659
Well, I’m amazed.

165
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:59,133
Ladies and gentlemen, Bruno will play
something for you on his glockenspiel,

166
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,372
because Bruno has Eva with him now.

167
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:15,012
<i>Sabine was a woman</i>
<i>who was very pious and virtuous indeed</i>

168
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,534
<i>She was always</i>
<i>a loyal and honest servant to her masters</i>

169
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,978
<i>Up to a certain day</i>

170
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:34,012
<i>Then a young man came</i>
<i>from Treuenbriezen</i>

171
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,613
<i>With false hopes</i>

172
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,820
<i>He was keen on making Sabine his own,</i>
<i>and he was a shoemaker</i>

173
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,733
<i>A labourer, a proletarian</i>

174
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,693
<i>The trouble starts</i>

175
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,059
<i>He'd spent all his money</i>
<i>on schnapps and on beer</i>

176
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,139
<i>Cheers, cheers, cheers</i>

177
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,499
<i>So he came running to Sabine</i>
<i>and asked her to give him some more</i>

178
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,739
<i>And he went like this...</i>

179
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,695
<i>She couldn't give him any money</i>

180
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,775
<i>Because there wasn't any</i>

181
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,135
<i>So he stole six silver tablespoons</i>
<i>from her masters</i>

182
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,612
<i>He filled his pockets.</i>
<i>Before, he'd always kicked her arse</i>

183
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,899
<i>But it didn't take more than 18 long weeks</i>
<i>for the theft to be discovered</i>

184
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,618
<i>Sabine was chased</i>
<i>out of the house in disgrace</i>

185
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,893
- Come here. Come on.
- Yes.

186
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,212
- Come here. Come on.
- Come here. Come on.

187
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,052
Come here.

188
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,891
- Little Jacob.
- Violin.

189
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,212
Violin.

190
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,336
Eva, what are you doing here?

191
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,938
The plague's breaking out.
This place stinks.

192
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,250
That must be the dogs.

193
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,296
There aren't any dogs here.

194
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,655
Then the dogs are yet to come.

195
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,049
I guess I'll have to open the door, then.

196
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,892
Come on, little snail.

197
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,293
You bitch!

198
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,691
I'll plant that midget in the ground for you,
over there.

199
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,738
As high or as deep as you want.

200
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,779
- As a Christmas tree.
- With lametta and Christmas tree balls.

201
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,892
But please, please rid me of this cretin.

202
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,698
Please, please.

203
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,452
- Where do you think Eva is?
- I’m sure she'll come.

204
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,209
I wonder if I should go
and ask the neighbour if he's seen anything

205
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,973
or if she's left a note with him.

206
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,653
Or do you think she's in the pub?

207
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,689
This piano is hard. The sound is dull.

208
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,299
Better than no instrument at all.

209
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,293
Who knows where I would have ended up
without it?

210
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,053
Come on. Come up here.

211
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,570
You can't even make enough money
to get your stuff back from the pawnbroker's.

212
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,494
- You bastards!
- Come up here. Come on.

213
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,855
Let's see what you've got.

214
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,693
No!

215
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,738
Come on, you dirty old slut.

216
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,732
You bitch!

217
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,336
Look at this rubbish bin.
There you go.

218
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,289
Grab this and then pull.

219
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,655
Heave-ho!

220
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,578
And here we've got
the little hat for our little star.

221
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,888
Yes.

222
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,335
The rubbish collection's done.

223
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,292
Eva, get up. Don't be scared. It’s Bruno.

224
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,939
Eva, get up. Come on.

225
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,289
Come on.

226
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,779
Eva, I’ve made you a cup of tea,
and there are some biscuits for you too.

227
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,256
Go on, take it.

228
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,099
Eva, please take it. Have a little sip at least.

229
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,180
What was the matter, Eva?

230
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,535
Don't ask, Bruno.

231
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,656
One kilo of grapes, please.

232
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,168
And one kilo of tangerines for Eva.

233
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,452
The artist as the tramp,
and the tramp as the artists.

234
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,371
Play!

235
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,818
Now stay here. I’ve got something for you.

236
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,460
Turn around a little. Turn around.

237
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,179
Right, and now...

238
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,216
Here we go.

239
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,695
Kneel down, you tramp.

240
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,056
Kneel down! Come on.

241
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,457
Kneel down!

242
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,216
Where's the whip? Kneel down, arsehole!

243
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,579
Put your head down there.
Stretch out your hands. That's it.

244
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,969
Draw up your knees.

245
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,133
For God's sake,
stretch your hands out eastwards.

246
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,849
You are living in the Turkish neighbourhood,
aren't you?

247
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,056
- Answer me.
- Yes.

248
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,653
- Speak up.
- Yes.

249
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,776
Well done.

250
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,371
Keep your nut like this.
Keep it straight. Careful.

251
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,371
There's another one.

252
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,290
Another bell.

253
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,168
Are you out of your mind, you idiot?

254
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,694
Oh, the bottle.

255
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,012
The most important thing in life. Right.

256
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,297
I want you to stay like this, do you hear me?

257
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,052
- Yes, I heard you.
- Speak up!

258
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,051
- Yes.
- Well done.

259
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,496
Bruno, don't be so dejected.

260
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,695
It’s going to be all right.

261
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:57,969
You can come back any time,
even at night, if necessary.

262
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:05,698
Only on Tuesdays on Thursdays,
I’m at the prison hospital ward, as usual.

263
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,739
Your girl is roaming around,
and she's run away from you again.

264
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,213
And you say you can't defend yourself.

265
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:24,018
You know you've spent
many years in homes.

266
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,775
They've knocked your ability
to defend yourself out of you.

267
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,373
You should look for a permanent job.

268
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,535
Singing in courtyards
might not be the right thing.

269
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:46,134
You see, Bruno, we would be
much more advanced in this world,

270
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,056
if we knew the answers
to all your questions.

271
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,692
I keep on wondering.

272
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,489
There are many things in my job
that I find disconcerting

273
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,856
and many things that I find disturbing.

274
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,455
We simply know so little
about us human beings.

275
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,649
Come with me to
the premature baby ward.

276
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,208
I'd like to show you something.

277
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:24,814
You see, Bruno,
even we doctors have many problems

278
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,928
that we cannot solve,
many questions that we cannot answer.

279
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,296
Look at this premature baby...

280
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:41,172
and this strong...grip reflex.

281
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,491
Perhaps...

282
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,614
this child will become chancellor one day.

283
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,810
- Bruno, we should call the police.
- What's the matter?

284
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,260
Hadn't I better go to the police?

285
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,773
No.

286
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,014
We'll go away from here, Bruno.

287
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,418
I'll stay with you. I won't run away again.

288
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,057
OK.

289
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,289
- Where is Wisconsin, anyway?
- I don't think it's on this map.

290
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,172
- There it is. North America.
- Oh, yes, there it is.

291
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,731
This is where Wisconsin is.
It’s near Canada.

292
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,049
Mr Scheitz, Bruno is way too old.

293
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,457
Take a look at the top of my head.
You can see the scalp shining through.

294
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,091
Oh, Bruno,
I’m much older than you, and I’m going.

295
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,013
If you want something, you're never too old.

296
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,533
You're never too old.

297
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,056
We could just go,
and if we don't like it, we'll come back.

298
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,260
- Well, we can try.
- And look, Chicago, New York, California...

299
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,093
Everyone makes money there.
We'll manage too.

300
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,377
What about the crossing and the visa?

301
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,049
We don't even have the money to get there.

302
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,813
I’ll raise the money. That's no problem.

303
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,449
- Hello.
- Hello. Let me kiss you.

304
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,138
- Hello.
- Hello.

305
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,654
- Fucky-fuck?
- Yes.

306
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,891
- How much?
- How much are you asking?

307
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,938
- Fifty.
- No, expensive.

308
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,578
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five.

309
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,096
Look at this. Fifty.

310
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,533
- Thirty.
- Fifty.

311
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,088
- No, expensive.
- Fifty is cheap.

312
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,898
- No, expensive.
- Have a look.

313
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,857
- Thirty-five.
- Fifty, come on.

314
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,373
- Thirty-five.
- Come on, fifty.

315
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,257
- Thirty-five.
- Come on.

316
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,574
Right. Bruno, what do you say now?
I’ve made all this money.

317
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,369
- I can't believe it.
- That'll be enough. We'll start a new life.

318
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,056
We will indeed.
And it's about time Bruno left Berlin, too.

319
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,373
- The place gets on my nerves anyway.
- I have good news from my nephew.

320
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,535
He wrote to me
that you can work in his garage.

321
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,655
I can?

322
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,292
And you, Eva, can work
as a waitress in a restaurant.

323
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,698
It’s similar to our motorway service areas.

324
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,613
There are truckers
passing through all the time.

325
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,409
- Very good.
- Look, this is my nephew.

326
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,378
That's his assistant, an Indian.

327
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,896
As far as accommodation is concerned,

328
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,498
he writes that it's no problem to put up a
mobile home, there's enough space there.

329
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,930
Eva? What kind of a country...

330
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,175
would confiscate Bruno's mynah bird?

331
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,939
- This is it. I think we're there.
- Yes.

332
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,209
Yes, that's the Indian.

333
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,453
He knows this German sentence,
''Was ist los? Der Hund ist los.''

334
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,011
He was in the air force in Ramstein.
That's where I first saw him.

335
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,692
They call this place Railroad Flats
because trains pass through all the time.

336
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,575
An ungated level crossing.

337
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,134
Bruno, Clayton suspects that there have
been not four, but five murders in this town.

338
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,089
Some time ago,
a man went out into the field on his tractor,

339
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,571
and that was the last anyone's seen of him,
there hasn't been a trace of him since.

340
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,697
Even the police haven't found anything.

341
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,340
Now Clayton has bought a metal detector

342
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,856
because he thinks
that the man might have been shot

343
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,091
and drowned in the pond
together with his tractor.

344
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,378
Clayton goes out every weekend
to look for him with his metal detector.

345
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,373
And now that it's so cold outside,
he can step onto the ponds

346
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,214
to see if the tractor
has indeed been sunk.

347
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,455
Let's see what's here.

348
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,688
Cheers.

349
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,930
Bruno, Clayton says
you should stay away from that fence

350
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,979
while the two farmers
are ploughing out there.

351
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:49,657
They've been arguing
about this strip of fallow land for ten years.

352
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,733
As soon as one of them turns up,
the other one comes too,

353
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:58,575
and they watch each other to make sure
that neither of them ploughs that strip.

354
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,448
One day, there'll be a shoot-out.

355
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,852
I’ve noticed that the two farmers carry guns.

356
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,534
And they pass each other very closely.

357
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,459
- Mr Scheitz, we even have a bathtub.
- Oh, fabulous.

358
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,774
Fantastic, fantastic.

359
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,851
- How lovely.
- Very nice.

360
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,578
- Marble.
- Like marble.

361
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,619
- It’s marvellous.
- There isn't any water yet.

362
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,652
Oh, no. I’m no good at that.

363
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,369
It’s like a birthday.

364
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,258
- You are good at this.
- No.

365
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,288
<i>In Friedenau, the sky is blue</i>

366
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,329
<i>And the goat dances with his wife</i>

367
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,413
That's enough dancing now.
Let's get serious.

368
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:01,010
- We must establish ourselves here.
- How do you do that?

369
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,293
- Now we've made it.
- Shall l make something to eat?

370
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,769
Now we've made it.

371
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,932
So, little Eva...do you like it here?

372
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:15,569
- Do you?
- Yes, I like it very much.

373
00:58:48,546 --> 00:58:50,343
Hello, gentlemen.

374
00:58:55,226 --> 00:58:59,185
I have made an important discovery
about animal magnetism.

375
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:02,224
May I take some readings of your car?

376
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:21,138
Gentlemen, I apologise for keeping you.

377
00:59:21,226 --> 00:59:25,344
I’ve made an important discovery
about animal magnetism.

378
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:28,224
May I take some readings of you?

379
00:59:29,626 --> 00:59:32,584
As you can see, the needle is swinging.

380
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,543
And now the animal.

381
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:40,302
The animal's gone cold.
The needle is no longer swinging.

382
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:44,459
I really appreciate your help,

383
00:59:44,546 --> 00:59:47,743
and I wish you all the best, goodbye.

384
00:59:47,826 --> 00:59:51,136
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

385
00:59:55,786 --> 00:59:56,741
Bye.

386
01:00:40,746 --> 01:00:42,259
May I come in?

387
01:00:42,346 --> 01:00:44,621
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr Scheitz.

388
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:46,298
Hello, Bruno.

389
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:50,502
I have... Would you hold this, please?

390
01:00:51,826 --> 01:00:55,182
I have managed
to make an exciting discovery.

391
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:59,822
Animal magnetism,
as described by Mesmer,

392
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:05,782
can now be measured by me,
which was previously impossible.

393
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:10,341
Even as a child I knew

394
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:16,137
that one day I would succeed
in measuring this animal magnetism.

395
01:01:16,226 --> 01:01:18,535
What is animal magnetism?

396
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:24,178
Animal magnetism is now called hypnosis.

397
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,422
Perhaps not quite rightly so.

398
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:32,858
The fact that it can be measured
is also indicated in Schopenhauer's book

399
01:01:32,946 --> 01:01:38,020
On The Fourfold Root
Of The Principle Of Sufficient Reason.

400
01:01:38,106 --> 01:01:42,782
Let me demonstrate the measurement
on you, Bruno.

401
01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:46,702
- See how the needle is swinging?
- it really works.

402
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:50,415
- Eva, I’d like to try it on you as well.
- Yes, please go ahead.

403
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:53,734
- The reaction is weaker than with Bruno.
- Yes.

404
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:57,262
- Why is that?
- Bruno is somehow more highly charged.

405
01:02:23,146 --> 01:02:24,738
I’ve got it.

406
01:03:17,746 --> 01:03:22,262
This could be a part of the missing tractor.
What component is this?

407
01:03:24,706 --> 01:03:27,300
it might be in one of the ponds.

408
01:03:57,026 --> 01:03:58,539
Well.

409
01:04:03,026 --> 01:04:06,416
- How will we pay the instalment?
- Please stop it.

410
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:10,419
- Yes, I’ll stop. I’ve only just started!
- I’m sick of it.

411
01:04:10,506 --> 01:04:16,138
The TV, the house -
and then there's the contracts.

412
01:04:19,066 --> 01:04:22,979
Everything's written in English,
and there's so much small print.

413
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:25,626
I can read English, don't worry.

414
01:04:25,706 --> 01:04:28,903
I imagined that things would be different
in America.

415
01:04:28,986 --> 01:04:32,501
I thought I’d get rich quick through my work.

416
01:04:32,586 --> 01:04:36,056
Stop it, Bruno.
I’m really fed up with this subject.

417
01:04:37,146 --> 01:04:40,661
As I’ve said before,
everyone can make money in America.

418
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:43,624
It’s no problem at all.
I’ll manage, you'll see.

419
01:04:43,706 --> 01:04:47,221
- You'll manage. I’m sure.
- Yes, I will.

420
01:06:25,266 --> 01:06:26,938
Eva, look at that.

421
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:33,062
He's doing it without a tape measure,
without a ruler or anything.

422
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,656
To the millimetre.

423
01:06:50,746 --> 01:06:53,340
Can't you do this somewhere else?
I can't see.

424
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:57,021
- Do you think you're transparent?
- Can you see it now?

425
01:06:57,106 --> 01:06:59,984
OK. Everything's fine.

426
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:13,219
Hello.

427
01:07:13,306 --> 01:07:16,696
Eva, this is the gentleman from the bank.

428
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:18,420
He says that we have to pay the money
because we're behind with the instalments.

429
01:08:18,506 --> 01:08:22,545
And if we don't pay,
he has to take away the television.

430
01:08:22,626 --> 01:08:25,538
See, Eva, what did I tell you?

431
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:29,585
There we are.
And the other stuff's right there.

432
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:33,136
- I’ll cope with this guy. Don't worry.
- Yes, you'll cope with him.

433
01:08:33,226 --> 01:08:35,421
I’ll manage, you'll see.

434
01:08:46,586 --> 01:08:48,781
He needs the money.

435
01:09:07,306 --> 01:09:11,538
How did you get this much money, Eva?

436
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:15,062
- I earned it.
- You don't earn that much as a waitress.

437
01:09:15,146 --> 01:09:19,059
- How and where did you earn it?
- How do you think I earned it?

438
01:09:19,146 --> 01:09:22,024
You earned it somehow.

439
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:56,544
Your visit has honoured us very much.

440
01:09:59,506 --> 01:10:03,294
Goodbye. What a friendly visit.

441
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:22,063
Eva, I have constructed
a schematic representation

442
01:11:23,106 --> 01:11:25,984
of how Bruno feels

443
01:11:26,066 --> 01:11:33,495
when they're gently
closing all the doors to him.

444
01:11:34,506 --> 01:11:37,339
We're in America now.

445
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,975
I thought that in America
everything would get better

446
01:11:41,066 --> 01:11:43,785
and that we would finally reach our goal.

447
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,697
But no.

448
01:11:45,786 --> 01:11:50,576
Bruno is being chopped off,
as if he'd never existed.

449
01:11:51,866 --> 01:11:54,858
You wouldn't recognise me any more.

450
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:58,542
Bruno, nobody kicks you here.

451
01:11:58,626 --> 01:12:03,495
No, not in that way. Not visibly.
But they do it mentally.

452
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:05,019
How? in what way?

453
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:09,702
in the homes,
it was just the same as it is here.

454
01:12:11,506 --> 01:12:16,341
If anyone wet his bed -
this was during the time of the Nazis -

455
01:12:16,426 --> 01:12:23,025
in order to spare the washing line that
you stretched out and hung your laundry on,

456
01:12:24,066 --> 01:12:29,015
they used to make that person stand
in the yard like this with his sheet all day.

457
01:12:29,106 --> 01:12:32,576
And the teacher would be
standing behind him with a stick.

458
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:38,377
And if the guy's arms got tired
so that he dropped his sheet,

459
01:12:38,466 --> 01:12:41,219
- he got a thrashing immediately.
- Sit down.

460
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:44,662
Right, now I’ll sit down again.

461
01:12:44,746 --> 01:12:49,297
- Did you have to do that too?
- Yes, but that was visible.

462
01:12:49,946 --> 01:12:53,575
These days, things are different, of course.

463
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:57,102
They no longer do it like this or like that,

464
01:12:57,186 --> 01:13:03,261
they do it the gentle way,
and that's much worse than it seems.

465
01:13:04,506 --> 01:13:07,259
And there's more.

466
01:13:07,346 --> 01:13:13,023
Who knows what fate has in store for you?

467
01:13:13,106 --> 01:13:17,145
- What? I didn't understand that.
- Yes, that's right.

468
01:13:18,546 --> 01:13:21,299
Who knows what fate has in store for you?

469
01:13:21,386 --> 01:13:23,775
The prison doors are open.

470
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:27,825
We're no longer in Germany.
Over here, you have to be careful.

471
01:13:32,546 --> 01:13:35,424
- Bruno, don't be so cross.
- Cross?

472
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:40,097
Cross? Why shouldn't I be cross?

473
01:13:40,186 --> 01:13:44,338
When people are despised...
I mean when they're grown-up,

474
01:13:45,746 --> 01:13:51,981
and they long for love
and they're banished from the bedroom...

475
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:55,263
He's not supposed
to sleep with you any more.

476
01:13:55,346 --> 01:14:00,818
- Yes, but look...
- He has to sleep in a separate room

477
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:04,023
- like somebody in a cage.
- Bruno, listen to me.

478
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:08,816
- Look, I need to be alone once in a while.
- Do you?

479
01:14:08,906 --> 01:14:16,494
And this is what it looks like when a man
is writhing with painful longing.

480
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:20,215
And that's the emotional pain.
This is what it looks like.

481
01:14:21,186 --> 01:14:25,623
And if you think that you can make it
on your own, here in America...

482
01:14:27,306 --> 01:14:29,866
then please go ahead and try.

483
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:32,414
Bruno, look, you have to understand.

484
01:14:33,266 --> 01:14:36,895
I need to be alone once in a while.
I need a room to myself sometimes.

485
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:41,821
I’ve never had a room to myself before.
I just need it.

486
01:14:43,106 --> 01:14:48,738
And when you're sleeping in the other
bedroom, we're still in the same house.

487
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:52,899
That doesn't mean we're separated.
And we're together all day.

488
01:14:54,386 --> 01:14:56,502
But then I don't know what to do any more.

489
01:14:57,946 --> 01:15:00,414
Then I’m really at the end of my tether.

490
01:15:22,866 --> 01:15:27,064
Yes, Bruno, Bruno, yes.
Written off, written off.

491
01:15:27,146 --> 01:15:32,425
Bruno was so stupid, stupid, stupid
to have done this in the first place,

492
01:15:32,506 --> 01:15:37,819
to have come to America,
where my whole world is collapsing again.

493
01:15:37,906 --> 01:15:41,785
I might as well have stayed
where I came from.

494
01:15:41,866 --> 01:15:44,255
No. No. No.

495
01:15:46,306 --> 01:15:48,501
I’m really pessimistic about all this.

496
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:52,575
I don't need any more good advice.

497
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,617
One learns by experience.

498
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:33,937
If it's not too late.

499
01:19:14,106 --> 01:19:16,062
Where's Eva?

500
01:19:52,146 --> 01:19:56,662
- What are you doing here, Eva?
- Are you crazy? How did you get here?

501
01:19:56,746 --> 01:19:59,977
- Go away. Make yourself scarce.
- You want me to go away?

502
01:20:00,066 --> 01:20:03,854
Yes, beat it. I’m going to Vancouver
with these two. It’s fun there.

503
01:20:03,946 --> 01:20:06,858
- Beat it!
- OK, I’m beating it.

504
01:20:35,466 --> 01:20:38,026
No, sit down over here.

505
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:51,222
This language is a little unfamiliar to me,

506
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:55,303
but there's something nasty going on.

507
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:37,500
I guess I could do it. There you go.
Just so you'll maybe get some peace.

508
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:47,103
So now you're shoving off, eh?
When's your next visit due?

509
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:51,419
Bye.

510
01:22:13,946 --> 01:22:15,698
He wanted money.

511
01:22:15,786 --> 01:22:17,742
- Money?
- Yes.

512
01:22:19,866 --> 01:22:21,219
She's gone.

513
01:22:22,546 --> 01:22:26,983
The instalment contracts...
Like this...

514
01:22:27,066 --> 01:22:32,777
He's hanging from the gallows tree,
and the devil takes the hindmost.

515
01:22:33,746 --> 01:22:39,343
Well, this is the hindmost.
The devil will take him.

516
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:29,985
Gentlemen, you can't do this to us.
Not to us.

517
01:25:30,066 --> 01:25:32,182
This is a conspiracy.

518
01:25:32,266 --> 01:25:35,656
I will contact my friends
in the secret service.

519
01:25:35,746 --> 01:25:39,864
And then you'll see.
You will burn your fingers.

520
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:54,982
This conspiracy will be stopped now.

521
01:27:26,386 --> 01:27:30,664
- They're all in cahoots.
- Yes, they are.

522
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:42,025
I know that you're in cahoots
with all the others too.

523
01:27:46,706 --> 01:27:52,861
10...20... I’ll start again.

524
01:27:52,946 --> 01:27:58,020
10...15...20...22...32.

525
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:01,257
Come on, come on. Let's go.

526
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,420
10, 15... Wait.

527
01:29:12,386 --> 01:29:15,742
So you're involved as well?
May I ask who's sent you?

528
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,021
My last three dollars.

529
01:34:58,226 --> 01:35:00,456
Indeed.

530
01:35:00,546 --> 01:35:03,424
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
