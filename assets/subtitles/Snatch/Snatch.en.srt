1
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,271
<i>My name is Turkish.</i>

2
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:41,649
<i>Funny name for an Englishman, I know.</i>

3
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.</i>

4
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,906
<i>They named me after the plane.</i>

5
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:51,658
<i>Not many people are
named after a plane crash.</i>

6
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,869
<i>That's Tommy.</i>

7
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:56,331
<i>He tells people
he was named after a gun.</i>

8
00:00:56,872 --> 00:01:01,585
<i>But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.</i>

9
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,757
<i>Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.</i>

10
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,718
<i>Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.</i>

11
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,305
<i>It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.</i>

12
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:16,433
<i>I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.</i>

13
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:19,186
<i>But really, he's like my brother.</i>

14
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:23,524
<i>What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.</i>

15
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:27,402
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:</i>

16
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:29,864
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

17
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:32,783
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

18
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:36,996
<i>- Himy, would you listen to this?
- Do we have a choice?</i>

19
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:40,959
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken literally.</i>

20
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:44,003
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.</i>

21
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:46,296
<i>It's bound with moral fibre...</i>

22
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:50,176
<i>... but asking a grown man
to believe it?</i>

23
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,427
<i>What is it?</i>

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,182
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

25
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:01,186
<i>What you want I should do,
drop my pants?</i>

26
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:03,063
<i>Okay, go through.</i>

27
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,483
<i>It's a nice story.</i>

28
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:10,153
<i>It's just that. Just a story.</i>

29
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:13,824
<i>Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.</i>

30
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:16,536
<i>Enough already. Ruben, say something.</i>

31
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:19,372
<i>Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.</i>

32
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:23,835
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for 'young woman'...</i>

33
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,253
<i>... into the Greek word for 'virgin.'</i>

34
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:28,923
<i>It was an easy mistake to make...</i>

35
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:33,719
<i>... because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.</i>

36
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:45,856
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy:</i>

37
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:50,319
<i>'Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son. '</i>

38
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:54,615
<i>You understand? It was 'virgin'
that caught people's attention.</i>

39
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:59,078
<i>It's not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son.</i>

40
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:19,389
<i>But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...</i>

41
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:23,227
<i>... and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

42
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,605
<i>Oy vay, what are you saying?</i>

43
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,442
<i>I'm saying, just because
it's written...</i>

44
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,235
<i>... doesn't make it so.</i>

45
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:35,406
<i>Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.</i>

46
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:38,075
<i>- People like to believe.
- I don't want to hear anymore.</i>

47
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:41,579
<i>Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?</i>

48
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:43,872
<i>- Michael.
- Hello?</i>

49
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,834
<i>Mutti.</i>

50
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,754
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,760
<i>Rud, it's okay, let them through.</i>

52
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,012
- Michael.
- Mutti.

53
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:02,933
You've kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,900
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:14,653
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,613
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,574
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:22,202
- Get down!
- Get fucking down!

59
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,706
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,206
On the ground!

61
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,213
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,507
- Time.
- Seven minutes!

63
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:39,512
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,850
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:49,021
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,778
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,033
When does your plane leave?

68
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,326
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,620
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:42,175
When you get to London...

71
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:44,262
...if you want a gun...

72
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:46,389
...call this number.

73
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,187
- Boris.
- Boris.

74
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,608
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,617
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,204
<i>It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.</i>

77
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,540
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

78
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:15,125
<i>What's with those sausages,
Charlie?</i>

79
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,002
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:22,425
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,177
We'll need a proper office.

82
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:27,387
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

83
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,223
Why me?

84
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,850
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,519
<i>How's that?</i>

86
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,189
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:40,651
<i>And I don't want to have me pants
pulled down over the price.</i>

88
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,237
<i>What's wrong with this one?</i>

89
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,822
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,908
<i>It's tiptop.</i>

91
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:49,952
<i>I'm just not sure about the colour.</i>

92
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,331
<i>It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.</i>

93
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,375
<i>Here's an address.</i>

94
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,545
<i>It's a campsite.</i>

95
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,132
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

96
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:08,096
<i>- What's happening with them sausages?
- Five minutes.</i>

97
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,934
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:14,810
<i>They ain't pikeys, are they?</i>

99
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,730
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,608
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

101
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,404
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:28,490
<i>- What's that?
- It's me belt.</i>

103
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,076
<i>No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.</i>

104
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:34,455
<i>- What's a gun doing in your trousers?
- It's for protection.</i>

105
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:35,914
Protection from what?

106
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:38,000
<i>'Zee' Germans?</i>

107
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,421
<i>What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?</i>

108
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,881
- Where did you get it?
- Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,634
You mean Boris the sneaky,
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:49,886
<i>Heavy, isn't it?</i>

111
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:52,807
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,268
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:58,145
<i>If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.</i>

114
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:01,481
<i>Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.</i>

115
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:05,028
<i>Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.</i>

116
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,323
<i>Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.</i>

117
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,285
<i>Back to my partner, Tommy.</i>

118
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,370
<i>Tommy runs the other business...</i>

119
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:17,248
<i>... the slot machines...</i>

120
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:21,043
<i>... which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.</i>

121
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:25,631
<i>However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.</i>

122
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,134
All right, I'll take it.

123
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:32,304
<i>There's a reason for Tommy's newfound
enthusiasm for firearms.</i>

124
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:37,018
<i>Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:</i>

125
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,519
<i>Brick Top.</i>

126
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,397
<i>If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.</i>

127
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,734
<i>- He doesn't look bad, does he?
- No, he looks great.</i>

128
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,402
He'll do you proud.

129
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:50,740
<i>You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?</i>

130
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,033
<i>It's what you deserve.</i>

131
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,661
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

132
00:09:55,702 --> 00:09:56,913
Dogs do that.

133
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,414
You're not a dog, are you?

134
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,083
<i>No. No, I'm not.</i>

135
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,751
However...

136
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:07,256
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

137
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:08,758
All except loyalty.

138
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:13,428
<i>It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...</i>

139
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:17,850
<i>... a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.</i>

140
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,480
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

141
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:27,442
But I got no time for grouses.

142
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,614
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

143
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,326
What the fuck are you two looking at?

144
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:42,584
<i>If you got to deal with him, just
make sure you don't end up owing him.</i>

145
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,085
<i>Then you're in his debt.</i>

146
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:46,546
<i>Which means, you're in his pocket.</i>

147
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:50,173
<i>And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.</i>

148
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,927
<i>I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.</i>

149
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:56,389
I'll be doing you a favour, boy.

150
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,517
<i>What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.</i>

151
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:05,273
<i>Because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights. Unlike his.</i>

152
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:08,150
<i>Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.</i>

153
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,860
<i>You don't like me, do you?</i>

154
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:11,446
<i>Don't know what you mean.</i>

155
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,698
<i>I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.</i>

156
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:20,203
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

157
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,706
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

158
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,418
<i>You can sort me out by showing me out.</i>

159
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,504
<i>It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...</i>

160
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,298
<i>... you do something
against your principles.</i>

161
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,552
<i>Basically, you have to forget
you got any.</i>

162
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,220
Are they Lancashire pigs?

163
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,971
<i>Who's talking to you?</i>

164
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,558
<i>Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.</i>

165
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:44,019
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

166
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,649
<i>You don't want to let me down, do you?</i>

167
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,818
See you ringside.

168
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,618
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

169
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:01,537
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

170
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:05,416
<i>I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.</i>

171
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,876
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

172
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,922
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

173
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,548
<i>But don't you hit him either.</i>

174
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,885
<i>Americans can't know it was Russian.</i>

175
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:18,804
It will come back to me.

176
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,975
You're my brother, so think like it.

177
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,272
Get somebody else to steal that stone!

178
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:29,606
<i>I don't want it getting back to me.</i>

179
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:32,735
<i>And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.</i>

180
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,736
<i>So don't use idiots for the job.</i>

181
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:38,615
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...

182
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:41,286
...so move quick. Okay?

183
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:46,540
One more thing.

184
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,375
It might help.

185
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,669
He loves to gamble.

186
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,048
Eighty-six carats?

187
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,259
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

188
00:12:58,052 --> 00:12:59,553
A beautiful stone.

189
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:00,846
<i>You're a good boy, Franky.</i>

190
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:04,182
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

191
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:09,230
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

192
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,982
- Talk to my cousin Dougie.
- Doug The Head?

193
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:16,821
And Franky...

194
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:19,573
<i>- And what?
- Stay out of those casinos.</i>

195
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,703
<i>You did a good job, bubbe.</i>

196
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:27,874
<i>- Don't go screwing it up, all right?
- I hear you, Avi.</i>

197
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll see you, Avi.

198
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,048
Eighty-six carats.

199
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,924
- Where?
- London.

200
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,759
- London?
- London.

201
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,011
- London?
- Yes, London.

202
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,599
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

203
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,019
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

204
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,022
Not for me.

205
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,399
<i>That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.</i>

206
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:57,153
<i>If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.</i>

207
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,738
<i>Pretends he's Jewish.</i>

208
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,530
<i>Wishes he was Jewish.</i>

209
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:02,991
<i>Even tells his family
they're Jewish...</i>

210
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:06,537
<i>... but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.</i>

211
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:10,750
<i>He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...</i>

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,378
<i>... it is good for business.
- Avi!</i>

213
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:15,712
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

214
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,591
<i>Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.</i>

215
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,469
<i>He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.</i>

216
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,804
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

217
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,847
<i>We play by the rules.</i>

218
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,432
Listen to me.

219
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:30,979
<i>If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?</i>

220
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,149
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.</i>

221
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,615
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,701
<i>It's a free country, isn't it?</i>

223
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,828
<i>Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?</i>

224
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,913
So fuck off.

225
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:03,219
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

226
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,554
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

227
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:08,557
- You got to go see him.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

228
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,144
<i>- He's a big mucker in New York.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.</i>

229
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,855
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

230
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:17,567
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

231
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,658
The weight is sign of reliability.

232
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:28,536
I always go for reliability.

233
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:38,337
I'll take it.

234
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:40,173
How much do you want for it?

235
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:41,591
Nothing.

236
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,428
Okay, so what do you want for it?

237
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,221
I want you to do something for me.

238
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,143
There is a fight in couple of days.

239
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:54,979
What kind of a fight?

240
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,898
Unlicensed boxing.

241
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:01,277
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

242
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:06,073
If you place one down for me...

243
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:08,201
...we will call it quits.

244
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,745
<i>- Why don't you put it down yourself?
- Well...</i>

245
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,375
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

246
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:20,797
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

247
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:25,551
I know something most don't.

248
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:27,971
<i>So, nu?</i>

249
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,682
What do you know?

250
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:38,105
<i>It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.</i>

251
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:41,359
- Ten points.
- What are we doing here?

252
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:45,446
- We're buying a caravan.
- Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

253
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,615
<i>What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.</i>

254
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:49,701
Not if you're here.

255
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,786
Oh, you bastard.

256
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,538
I fucking hate pikeys.

257
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:58,960
<i>That's a flash car, mister.</i>

258
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,669
Not as flash as your bike.

259
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,839
Who are you looking for?

260
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,339
Mr. O'Neil.

261
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,343
<i>- Want me to get him?
- That's a good lad.</i>

262
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,345
Piss off.

263
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:12,890
- Are you going to go get him for me?
- Yeah.

264
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,894
- What are you waiting for?
- The five quid you'll pay me.

265
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:18,813
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

266
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:21,356
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.

267
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,151
You're a real tight fucker.

268
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,444
<i>There was a problem with gypsies.</i>

269
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,154
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

270
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:29,449
<i>You can't understand
what's being said.</i>

271
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,284
You Tommy? Come about the caravan?

272
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,786
- Mr. O'Neil.
- Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

273
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,579
<i>Not Irish, not English.</i>

274
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:38,082
<i>- How are you?
- Weather's been kind.</i>

275
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:40,042
<i>It's just Pikey.</i>

276
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,420
Would you look at the size of him?

277
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,505
How big are you?

278
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,758
- Kids, how big is he?
- Big, for sure.

279
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:49,635
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

280
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:55,098
<i>Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.</i>

281
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:57,935
<i>Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.</i>

282
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,479
I could murder one.

283
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,773
<i>Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.</i>

284
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:05,026
Get your hands out of there.

285
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,861
Cup of tea for the big fella?

286
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:10,240
<i>Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.</i>

287
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:12,909
You little bugger.

288
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,328
<i>- Is the big fella not coming with us?
- He's minding the car.</i>

289
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:20,375
- What does he think we are, thieves?
- No, nothing like that.

290
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,752
- He just likes looking after cars.
- Good dags. Do you like dags?

291
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:25,797
- Dags?
- What?

292
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,132
- Yeah, dags.
- Dags. You like dags?

293
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,384
Oh, dogs.

294
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,345
Sure, I like dags.

295
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,390
- I like caravans more.
- You're very welcome.

296
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:50,529
<i>Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.</i>

297
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,781
<i>It's probably why
they talk like that...</i>

298
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:55,159
<i>... so you can't follow
what's being said.</i>

299
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,829
<i>But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...</i>

300
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:01,457
<i>... on his return
there will be ice cream.</i>

301
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,500
Good dog, good family.

302
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,421
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

303
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:09,590
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

304
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,009
All right, Mickey. Laters.

305
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:14,971
<i>I don't see what the fuss is about.</i>

306
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,972
<i>They aren't bad fellas.</i>

307
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:29,402
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

308
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:32,739
<i>Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.</i>

309
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,824
See that car? Use it.

310
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,702
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

311
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:41,914
Nobody brings you...

312
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:45,042
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

313
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,922
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

314
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:52,215
<i>Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?</i>

315
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,595
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Over my dead body.

316
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,180
Now, go on! Go on!

317
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:01,392
I'll not have you fighting!
You know what happens when you fight!

318
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,394
Get her to sit down.

319
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:05,688
<i>For fuck's sake!</i>

320
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,654
<i>Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.</i>

321
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:16,449
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

322
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,756
<i>So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.</i>

323
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:34,217
You want to stay down.

324
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,682
You want to stay down!

325
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,229
Get back down and fucking stay down.

326
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,897
I promise you, you want to stay down.

327
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,233
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

328
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,486
Cheeky bastard.

329
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,287
- Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.

330
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:04,788
Get back down...

331
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,834
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

332
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:12,255
Bollocks to you.

333
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,673
<i>This is sick. I'm out of here.</i>

334
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:17,468
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

335
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,723
<i>You stay until the job's done.</i>

336
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,426
<i>It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...</i>

337
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:02,471
<i>... was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.</i>

338
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,432
<i>Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.</i>

339
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:09,938
<i>Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.</i>

340
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:12,898
<i>If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...</i>

341
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:15,401
<i>... Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.</i>

342
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:18,695
<i>Why would the gypsies
want to explain...</i>

343
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,115
<i>... why a man died in their campsite?</i>

344
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:24,576
<i>Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.</i>

345
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,330
<i>It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?</i>

346
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,916
<i>Tommy, 'The Tit'...</i>

347
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,794
<i>... is praying.</i>

348
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:34,336
<i>And if he isn't...</i>

349
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:36,631
<i>... he fucking should be.</i>

350
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,617
Bad Boy.

351
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:07,996
- Sol.
- Easy.

352
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,999
<i>No, it's a moissanite.</i>

353
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:12,165
A what?

354
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,795
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

355
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:17,087
<i>It's Mickey Mouse.</i>

356
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:19,089
Spurious.

357
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,342
Not genuine.

358
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,510
<i>And it's worth...</i>

359
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:25,054
...fuck-all.

360
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:28,266
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

361
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,351
Leave this game to me and Sol.

362
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,020
Laters.

363
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:37,901
What is that, Vince?

364
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,861
This is a dog, Sol.

365
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:42,279
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

366
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,198
<i>It's only a fucking dog.</i>

367
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:45,991
<i>- Where'd you get it?
- The gyppos.</i>

368
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,326
Here.

369
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,413
They threw it in with the moody gold.

370
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:55,292
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

371
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,794
It better not be dangerous.

372
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:00,798
What do you think you're doing now?

373
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:04,176
<i>I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?</i>

374
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:07,763
Stop the dog!

375
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,223
Come back!

376
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:11,226
All right, Boris?

377
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,270
<i>- Don't worry about the dog.
- I'm not.</i>

378
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,066
What can I do for you?

379
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,609
I have a job for you.

380
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,569
I already have a job.

381
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:26,281
<i>Fifty grand for half a day's work.</i>

382
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:28,660
Go on.

383
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,204
I want you to hold up a bookies.

384
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,752
From Russia with love, eh?

385
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,838
I have stones to sell...

386
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:45,218
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

387
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,010
...so if I am not rushing you...

388
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:51,057
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

389
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:54,602
I am not in Rome, Doug.

390
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:56,520
I am in a rush.

391
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,397
I got to make the bookies.

392
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:59,856
Bookies?

393
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,111
- What are you betting on?
- Bomber Harris.

394
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:06,321
The unlicensed boxer?

395
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,035
Do you know something that I don't?

396
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:16,207
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

397
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:20,127
<i>He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?</i>

398
00:25:20,377 --> 00:25:21,587
Of course I am.

399
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:25,633
<i>Tyrone'll drive for us. He's
done a rally driving course.</i>

400
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:27,093
Of course I have.

401
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:32,682
<i>I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.</i>

402
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,433
Your seats?

403
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:36,935
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

404
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,105
<i>While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...</i>

405
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:43,734
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

406
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:46,863
<i>I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?</i>

407
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,823
It went back to the gyppos.

408
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:51,784
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

409
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:55,288
<i>Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.</i>

410
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,164
Ask him.

411
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:00,084
<i>It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.</i>

412
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:03,211
Steady on the brakes.

413
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,714
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

414
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:09,760
<i>Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.</i>

415
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:11,511
All right?

416
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:33,284
What?

417
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:37,413
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

418
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,500
<i>Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.</i>

419
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,292
Worry about getting us a gun.

420
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:48,674
<i>What's that?</i>

421
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:52,177
This is a shotgun, Sol.

422
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,222
<i>It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.</i>

423
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:59,434
<i>- I want to raise pulses, don't I?
- You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.</i>

424
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:20,163
That does not look like a bookies.

425
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:24,626
<i>Why'd we stop here? What's the
matter with that space over there?</i>

426
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:26,753
<i>It's too tight.</i>

427
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:28,881
Too tight?

428
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:32,050
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

429
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:36,513
<i>Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?</i>

430
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:38,348
Of course I am.

431
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:52,529
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

432
00:27:52,822 --> 00:27:54,824
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

433
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:57,868
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

434
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:00,538
<i>It's all right.
No, don't move it now.</i>

435
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:03,415
<i>People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?</i>

436
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:04,666
<i>I didn't see it.</i>

437
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:09,005
<i>It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.</i>

438
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,757
It was at a funny angle.

439
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,801
<i>It's behind you, Tyrone.</i>

440
00:28:15,053 --> 00:28:17,471
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

441
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:20,432
Control that dog as well.

442
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:23,478
- Get that dog off him.
- Get it off me.

443
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:28,273
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

444
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,195
<i>Don't snatch.</i>

445
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,075
<i>He can't swallow the whole ball.</i>

446
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,119
Yeah.

447
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:45,666
Why the fuck...

448
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,252
...did you put Gorgeous George...

449
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,172
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

450
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,715
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

451
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:57,261
<i>He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.</i>

452
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:01,682
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

453
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:04,352
What the fuck did you expect?

454
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:06,938
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

455
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:09,606
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

456
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:12,317
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

457
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:13,944
You did.

458
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:18,115
You said get a good deal.

459
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,910
I fail to recognize
the correlation...

460
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,247
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

461
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,789
...and a good deal.

462
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:28,250
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

463
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,295
<i>That his fight won't happen?</i>

464
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:32,255
We replace the fighter.

465
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,339
<i>Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?</i>

466
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,467
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

467
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:38,469
What about John The Gun?

468
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,180
Or Mad Fist Willy?

469
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:43,641
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

470
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:45,894
Mad Fist went mad...

471
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:48,770
...and The Gun shot himself.

472
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,986
Jesus.

473
00:29:59,115 --> 00:29:59,907
What?

474
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:02,117
<i>Let's use the fucking pikey.</i>

475
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:05,872
- How much you gonna pay us?
- 10 K.

476
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:09,459
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

477
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:18,800
All right.

478
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:22,012
I'll do it for a caravan.

479
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:23,847
A what?

480
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:25,266
A caravan.

481
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:29,103
- Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.

482
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,772
<i>Anyway, what's wrong with this one?</i>

483
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:34,107
<i>It's not for me.
It's for me ma.</i>

484
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:36,986
Your what?

485
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:38,363
His ma.

486
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,017
<i>Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.</i>

487
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:11,770
<i>They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.</i>

488
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,397
<i>Now I'm changing fighters...</i>

489
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:17,067
<i>... and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.</i>

490
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,988
<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...</i>

491
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:22,490
<i>... and aim for penetration.</i>

492
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,951
<i>If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...</i>

493
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:27,494
<i>... he'd want to split me in half.</i>

494
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:33,585
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

495
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,886
<i>Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?</i>

496
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:48,016
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

497
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:50,852
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

498
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,645
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

499
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,732
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,739
You're gonna have to repeat that.

501
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,825
We've lost Gorgeous George.

502
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:08,286
<i>Well, where'd you lose him?</i>

503
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:11,079
<i>He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?</i>

504
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:14,000
<i>And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?</i>

505
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,209
We're not backing out.

506
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,378
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

507
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,048
We're changing the fighter.

508
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,885
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

509
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:27,305
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

510
00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:29,891
<i>You won't know him, but he's mustard.</i>

511
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:31,183
Mustard?

512
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:35,145
<i>I don't care if he's
Muhammad ' I'm Hard' Bruce Lee...</i>

513
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:36,814
<i>... you can't change fighters.</i>

514
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:39,233
- You've still got your fight.
- No.

515
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:42,694
<i>I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.</i>

516
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:46,740
<i>So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?</i>

517
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,701
You can take bets at the fight.

518
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,578
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

519
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:54,123
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?

520
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:02,173
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

521
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:05,759
<i>You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?</i>

522
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:09,638
<i>This is the one place
I didn't want to be:</i>

523
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,140
<i>In his debt.</i>

524
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:13,977
<i>Which now means I'm in his pocket.</i>

525
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:17,020
You're on thin-fucking-ice,
my pedigree chums.

526
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:19,941
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

527
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,442
Now, fuck off.

528
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:33,954
<i>Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?</i>

529
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:37,416
<i>I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.</i>

530
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,252
- When later?
- He said he wanted cash.

531
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:43,506
<i>So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.</i>

532
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,471
A fight?

533
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:56,019
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

534
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,940
<i>- Is there gambling involved?
- It's a boxing match, Avi.</i>

535
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,692
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.

536
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,653
And this schmuck is gambling?

537
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:10,532
<i>You're talking about Franky ' I've got
a problem with gambling' Four Fingers.</i>

538
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,367
<i>Avi, I'm not telepathic.</i>

539
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,704
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

540
00:34:14,996 --> 00:34:17,581
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

541
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:19,166
I have no idea.

542
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,545
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

543
00:34:22,836 --> 00:34:25,465
<i>When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.</i>

544
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:27,675
<i>And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.</i>

545
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:29,344
<i>I'm sure he can pay.</i>

546
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:33,306
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

547
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:35,891
<i>Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!</i>

548
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,690
- Avi!
- Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

549
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,528
<i>I don't like leaving my own country...</i>

550
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,909
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

551
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,702
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

552
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:58,248
We've got sandy beaches.

553
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,333
So who the fuck wants to see them?

554
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:04,461
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

555
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,047
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

556
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,217
And we'll start at that fight.

557
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:13,304
How am I gonna get it out?

558
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:15,264
It will probably cough it up.

559
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:16,766
Will he be all right?

560
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,309
I hope not.

561
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,688
- Are we gonna rob this bookies?
- Yes, big man.

562
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:22,981
Why are we waiting?

563
00:35:23,273 --> 00:35:26,985
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

564
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:28,027
<i>And why's that?</i>

565
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:33,157
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

566
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:34,867
<i>What's in the case?</i>

567
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:39,371
<i>For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.</i>

568
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:42,125
Jesus.

569
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,628
<i>- Private night tonight, chaps.
- I'm well aware of that, my son.</i>

570
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:47,588
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

571
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,550
Well done. This is the back way in.

572
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:53,844
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

573
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:57,891
<i>- Private night tonight, chaps.
- We know. That's why we're here.</i>

574
00:35:58,557 --> 00:35:59,684
Tickets.

575
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:02,311
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

576
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:05,440
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

577
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,525
<i>This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.</i>

578
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,612
<i>I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.</i>

579
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:13,655
<i>I'm looking for Franky.</i>

580
00:36:13,947 --> 00:36:17,452
<i>I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.</i>

581
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:20,454
<i>- If there's gambling, he'll be here.
- Let's not have a fuck-up.</i>

582
00:36:20,704 --> 00:36:22,039
<i>You won't let us down.</i>

583
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:26,210
<i>He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.</i>

584
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,007
Is that him?

585
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:33,425
<i>I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?</i>

586
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,719
<i>Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.</i>

587
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,722
<i>Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.</i>

588
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,657
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

589
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:59,911
<i>If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything...</i>

590
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,918
What are you doing?

591
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:09,545
<i>What does it look like
I'm doing up here?</i>

592
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:14,592
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

593
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,135
Drop the screen now.

594
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:21,431
How you doing, Vince?

595
00:37:21,682 --> 00:37:24,059
<i>I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.</i>

596
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,353
- Fill that bag.
- All bets are off.

597
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:30,358
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

598
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:31,775
Appreciated...

599
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:33,902
...but all bets...

600
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:36,822
...are...

601
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:38,240
...off.

602
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:42,911
<i>If all bets are off, then there
can't be any money, can there?</i>

603
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:46,498
<i>I ain't fucking buying that.</i>

604
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:50,210
<i>That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.</i>

605
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:52,630
What have you got?

606
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:55,967
Nothing, really.

607
00:37:58,052 --> 00:37:59,554
A few coins, but no notes.

608
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:03,391
Show me your hands.

609
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,228
You've got five fingers.

610
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:11,608
Copper coins.

611
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:15,445
What do you mean,
copper-fucking-coins?

612
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:28,041
<i>It won't open
because it's a security door.</i>

613
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,416
Hold that.

614
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:39,885
My leg.

615
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,351
<i>What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.</i>

616
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:56,277
We're fucked.

617
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,661
What the fuck are you two doing?

618
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:11,208
Get us out of here.

619
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:19,842
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

620
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:30,269
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

621
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:36,943
<i>He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.</i>

622
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:40,655
In the red corner...

623
00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:43,407
...we have the young
and unchallenged...

624
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:47,911
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

625
00:39:48,204 --> 00:39:49,831
<i>Just make sure he doesn't kill me.</i>

626
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:53,918
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

627
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:56,295
...one-punch machine gun...

628
00:39:56,588 --> 00:39:58,422
...Mickey!

629
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,679
And in the other corner...

630
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:09,099
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker...

631
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:12,269
<i>Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.</i>

632
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,358
<i>Bomber 'The Mad Man' Harris!</i>

633
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:22,155
Now, try and look like a fighter.

634
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:24,865
<i>Let's get ready...</i>

635
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:27,201
...to rumble!

636
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:04,405
<i>Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?</i>

637
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:05,864
<i>What's the fucking crack?</i>

638
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:08,784
<i>- I'll make it up to you.
- I ain't happy.</i>

639
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:12,454
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

640
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,750
<i>Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.</i>

641
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:19,670
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

642
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,007
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

643
00:41:23,257 --> 00:41:24,675
<i>... I don't want to know
if it tastes good.</i>

644
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:29,931
<i>Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.</i>

645
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:54,664
<i>- He's here.
- Well, you explain it to him.</i>

646
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:04,632
- What you doing?
- The case was attached to his arm.

647
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,260
<i>So why didn't you chop it off?</i>

648
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:09,762
<i>We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.</i>

649
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:11,347
But he has the case.

650
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:14,224
Look, we...
Well, you have a problem.

651
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:17,728
<i>There weren't much cash
at the bookies.</i>

652
00:42:18,688 --> 00:42:19,856
Okay.

653
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,775
Here is the 10 grand.

654
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:25,945
No. Keep it. We want this.

655
00:42:26,362 --> 00:42:28,864
Well, at least half of this.

656
00:42:29,407 --> 00:42:31,951
What was in the case was mine.

657
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:35,496
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

658
00:42:35,788 --> 00:42:39,583
<i>It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.</i>

659
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:41,585
<i>No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.</i>

660
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:45,340
<i>We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.</i>

661
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:49,677
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

662
00:42:59,353 --> 00:43:00,688
Watch out!

663
00:43:03,106 --> 00:43:04,858
Drop the gun, fat boy.

664
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:12,367
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

665
00:43:13,534 --> 00:43:15,202
Give me the stone.

666
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:18,748
<i>- It's in the case.
- What?</i>

667
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,166
<i>It's in the case.</i>

668
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:23,001
You put the stone in the case?

669
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:26,047
Open it and give me the stone.

670
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:31,177
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

671
00:44:00,873 --> 00:44:04,710
<i>Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.</i>

672
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,923
<i>Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.</i>

673
00:44:10,173 --> 00:44:13,760
<i>I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

674
00:44:14,596 --> 00:44:18,682
<i>I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.</i>

675
00:44:18,932 --> 00:44:22,728
<i>But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.</i>

676
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:24,688
<i>Once I have that, it's...</i>

677
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:26,023
Oink, oink.

678
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:27,900
Shit.

679
00:44:30,193 --> 00:44:31,987
<i>So that's where you keep the sugar.</i>

680
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:36,784
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

681
00:44:38,494 --> 00:44:40,246
<i>That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?</i>

682
00:44:40,496 --> 00:44:42,831
<i>And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?</i>

683
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,043
No, we don't, John.

684
00:44:57,012 --> 00:44:59,097
I just had them polished.

685
00:45:04,811 --> 00:45:06,773
Go and put the kettle on.

686
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:13,655
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

687
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:16,282
<i>I'm sweet enough.</i>

688
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,085
<i>He's now your problem.</i>

689
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:29,795
Okay?

690
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:41,849
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

691
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:45,228
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

692
00:45:48,523 --> 00:45:49,898
Well, look at him.

693
00:45:57,114 --> 00:46:00,284
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

694
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:01,702
I want to use the pikey.

695
00:46:03,288 --> 00:46:04,621
All right. Of course.

696
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:07,125
Of course, fucking of course.

697
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,835
<i>I wasn't asking, I was telling.</i>

698
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,005
But this time...

699
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:16,634
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

700
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:21,639
And I do mean it, this time.

701
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,445
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

702
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:39,824
So now you can open it.

703
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:42,534
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

704
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:44,536
<i>I think he's got away with enough.</i>

705
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:48,833
<i>Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.</i>

706
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:51,001
That takes care of one little piggy.

707
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:54,088
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

708
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,590
Find them today.

709
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:17,070
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

710
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:18,987
Tommy.

711
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,534
<i>You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?</i>

712
00:47:23,784 --> 00:47:26,036
You're looking for my boy, are you?

713
00:47:26,286 --> 00:47:28,748
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Yeah.

714
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:31,960
Would you like
to share that information?

715
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,628
<i>I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.</i>

716
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,132
<i>He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.</i>

717
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:42,094
<i>He's coursing.</i>

718
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:45,931
<i>What's coursing?</i>

719
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:47,391
Hare coursing.

720
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:52,188
They set two lurchers...
They're dogs, before you ask.

721
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:54,648
On a hare.

722
00:47:55,315 --> 00:47:58,360
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

723
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,655
So, what if it doesn't?

724
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:05,451
<i>Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?</i>

725
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:10,664
Proper fucked?

726
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:12,708
Yeah, Tommy.

727
00:48:13,126 --> 00:48:15,335
Before 'zee' Germans get there.

728
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:20,425
Do you know these tits, Errol?

729
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:21,925
I know a lot of tits...

730
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,219
<i>... but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.</i>

731
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,637
John?

732
00:48:26,764 --> 00:48:28,141
<i>I can't help, guv.</i>

733
00:48:33,021 --> 00:48:34,313
Tyrone.

734
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:37,400
You silly, fat bastard.

735
00:48:38,902 --> 00:48:40,695
- Do you want to do it?
- That depends.

736
00:48:40,945 --> 00:48:41,905
On what?

737
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:45,032
On you buying this caravan.

738
00:48:45,282 --> 00:48:47,659
Not the rouge one. The rose.

739
00:48:48,202 --> 00:48:50,413
<i>- It's not the same caravan.
- Not the same fight.</i>

740
00:48:50,663 --> 00:48:52,623
<i>It's twice the size of the last one.</i>

741
00:48:52,873 --> 00:48:55,835
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

742
00:48:56,085 --> 00:48:59,047
<i>I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.</i>

743
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:03,217
<i>You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.</i>

744
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:06,804
<i>Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.</i>

745
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:12,684
<i>I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...</i>

746
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:15,230
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

747
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:27,367
<i>Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.</i>

748
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:31,036
Have I made myself clear?

749
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:35,500
<i>Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.</i>

750
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:39,045
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

751
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:45,927
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

752
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:49,972
I'll tell you what.

753
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:52,891
Fucker.

754
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:54,978
I'll bet you for it.

755
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:56,563
You'll what?

756
00:49:56,813 --> 00:49:58,106
He'll bet you for it.

757
00:49:58,648 --> 00:50:01,608
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

758
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:03,318
I'll do you a favour.

759
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,239
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

760
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:08,574
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

761
00:50:10,702 --> 00:50:12,452
If I lose...

762
00:50:14,664 --> 00:50:17,666
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

763
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:22,463
<i>The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.</i>

764
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,840
<i>However, I don't really
have much of a choice.</i>

765
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:28,719
<i>Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose...</i>

766
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:31,972
<i>Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.</i>

767
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:36,311
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

768
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:38,521
What? Proper fucked?

769
00:50:40,815 --> 00:50:42,483
You got that, London?

770
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:43,735
We're on!

771
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:58,809
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

772
00:51:59,476 --> 00:52:01,186
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

773
00:52:18,246 --> 00:52:20,914
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

774
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:25,295
<i>Who's proper fucked now, then?</i>

775
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:29,132
<i>There's something very wrong
with this.</i>

776
00:52:29,423 --> 00:52:32,635
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

777
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:38,016
<i>Well, why didn't you ' bust a cap
in his ass' then, Tommy?</i>

778
00:52:38,557 --> 00:52:41,728
<i>Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.</i>

779
00:52:41,978 --> 00:52:44,480
<i>What? You saying I can't shoot?</i>

780
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:48,275
<i>Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.</i>

781
00:52:48,568 --> 00:52:50,360
<i>I know you can't shoot.</i>

782
00:52:50,652 --> 00:52:54,949
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

783
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,159
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

784
00:52:57,409 --> 00:52:58,911
<i>You saying the gun don't work?</i>

785
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:00,496
You tried it?

786
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,793
Whoops.

787
00:53:09,297 --> 00:53:12,342
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

788
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,260
<i>Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?</i>

789
00:53:15,552 --> 00:53:17,429
To keep his head warm.

790
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,141
- What happened to him?
- He got shot in the face.

791
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:21,809
I thought that was obvious.

792
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:24,394
<i>What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?</i>

793
00:53:24,646 --> 00:53:27,106
- What do you want me to do?
- Sort it out.

794
00:53:27,356 --> 00:53:30,193
<i>- I'm not a witch doctor.
- But you are a bad boy yardie...</i>

795
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:33,278
...and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies.

796
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:36,282
<i>I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.</i>

797
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:44,373
We're in, governor.

798
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:48,210
Goody gumdrops.

799
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:50,838
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

800
00:53:52,715 --> 00:53:53,715
Grab hold of his legs.

801
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:56,844
<i>What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?</i>

802
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:09,940
Hope this is not a bad moment.

803
00:54:14,862 --> 00:54:16,155
Do you know who I am?

804
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:19,992
I do.

805
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:30,128
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

806
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:33,338
Well, I don't.

807
00:54:41,097 --> 00:54:45,559
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

808
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:47,978
Apparently, the best thing to do...

809
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:52,900
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

810
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:56,403
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

811
00:54:56,653 --> 00:54:59,574
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

812
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:03,286
<i>It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.</i>

813
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:12,670
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

814
00:55:14,255 --> 00:55:16,340
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

815
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,802
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

816
00:55:21,346 --> 00:55:24,849
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

817
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:26,893
<i>... for the piggies' digestion.</i>

818
00:55:27,184 --> 00:55:29,186
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

819
00:55:29,436 --> 00:55:31,856
<i>... but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?</i>

820
00:55:32,898 --> 00:55:36,735
They will go through bone like butter.

821
00:55:37,237 --> 00:55:41,032
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

822
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:45,286
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

823
00:55:45,536 --> 00:55:48,748
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

824
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:50,916
...in about eight minutes.

825
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,751
That means that a single pig...

826
00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:56,713
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

827
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,967
...every minute.

828
00:55:59,592 --> 00:56:01,552
Hence the expression...

829
00:56:01,802 --> 00:56:05,097
<i>... 'as greedy as a pig.'</i>

830
00:56:08,934 --> 00:56:13,231
<i>Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.</i>

831
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:16,650
<i>Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...</i>

832
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,778
...apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs, of course.

833
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,952
<i>Do you know what ' nemesis' means?</i>

834
00:56:30,331 --> 00:56:33,793
<i>'A righteous infliction
of retribution...</i>

835
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:37,922
<i>... manifested by an
appropriate agent.'</i>

836
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,344
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

837
00:56:43,844 --> 00:56:45,262
Me.

838
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:54,438
Gentlemen...

839
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:27,931
<i>Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?</i>

840
00:57:28,264 --> 00:57:32,726
<i>Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.</i>

841
00:57:34,436 --> 00:57:35,646
What about Tony?

842
00:57:35,896 --> 00:57:37,065
<i>Bullet-Tooth Tony.</i>

843
00:57:37,356 --> 00:57:38,190
<i>Who's Bullet-Tooth...</i>

844
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,443
- Tony!
- You silly fuck.

845
00:57:40,693 --> 00:57:41,735
<i>He's a liability.</i>

846
00:57:41,985 --> 00:57:44,155
<i>He'd find Moses and the burning bush.</i>

847
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:45,822
You are gonna die, Tony!

848
00:57:46,074 --> 00:57:49,284
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

849
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:51,913
I shoot you, you go down!

850
00:57:52,204 --> 00:57:54,958
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

851
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,918
<i>Why don't you fucking die?</i>

852
00:57:58,168 --> 00:58:00,797
<i>- He's the best chance you got.
- Six times?</i>

853
00:58:02,382 --> 00:58:03,757
In one sitting.

854
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,260
You're in trouble now.

855
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:10,139
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

856
00:58:22,777 --> 00:58:23,860
<i>Bonjour.</i>

857
00:58:27,322 --> 00:58:29,617
<i>What's so fucking important?</i>

858
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:32,036
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

859
00:58:32,286 --> 00:58:35,081
...missing an arm in our office?
- Talk to me, tell me.

860
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:37,125
You give us four days...

861
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:41,045
...I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

862
00:58:41,295 --> 00:58:42,505
What do you think, Errol?

863
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:45,967
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

864
00:58:46,217 --> 00:58:48,427
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

865
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:51,306
What have I told you about thinking?

866
00:58:51,931 --> 00:58:54,099
- You got 48 hours.
- Yeah.

867
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:57,644
<i>You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.</i>

868
00:58:57,896 --> 00:58:59,105
Forty-eight hours.

869
00:58:59,396 --> 00:59:00,815
<i>After that it's your family...</i>

870
00:59:01,106 --> 00:59:03,902
<i>... and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.</i>

871
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:10,282
<i>So, what should I call you?
Should I call you ' Bullet'? 'Tooth'?</i>

872
00:59:10,532 --> 00:59:12,159
Call me 'Susan'
if it makes you happy.

873
00:59:12,409 --> 00:59:15,829
<i>Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.</i>

874
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,751
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

875
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:20,835
Forty thousand.

876
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:25,547
Where was he last seen?

877
00:59:26,507 --> 00:59:27,382
At a bookies.

878
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:29,302
Bookies?

879
00:59:31,596 --> 00:59:33,472
Pass us the blower, Susi.

880
00:59:37,518 --> 00:59:40,605
- Bookies got blagged last night.
- Blagged? Speak English.

881
00:59:40,855 --> 00:59:45,568
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

882
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,195
Blagged, robbed.

883
00:59:47,445 --> 00:59:49,780
We'll see a man
that may know something.

884
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,782
I need a gun.

885
00:59:52,074 --> 00:59:55,119
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

886
00:59:57,664 --> 00:59:59,998
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

887
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,335
<i>He's stained for fucking life.</i>

888
01:00:02,626 --> 01:00:05,295
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell...

889
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:06,880
All right, Mullet?

890
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:13,596
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

891
01:00:14,429 --> 01:00:15,764
Nice tie.

892
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:17,641
<i>I heard you weren't about that much.</i>

893
01:00:17,891 --> 01:00:21,103
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

894
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:23,523
Unlike yours, Mullet.

895
01:00:24,315 --> 01:00:25,900
<i>Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?</i>

896
01:00:26,192 --> 01:00:29,403
- Do me a favour, Tone.
- I will do you a favour, Mullet.

897
01:00:29,653 --> 01:00:33,407
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

898
01:00:34,324 --> 01:00:37,869
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

899
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,710
Comfortable, Mullet?

900
01:00:44,126 --> 01:00:47,045
<i>It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.</i>

901
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:50,090
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

902
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,385
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

903
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:55,221
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

904
01:00:56,054 --> 01:00:59,474
<i>- What you think I'm doing?
- Well, don't, Tone.</i>

905
01:01:00,643 --> 01:01:02,561
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

906
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:04,063
Slow down, Tone.

907
01:01:04,355 --> 01:01:06,398
Slow down, Tony!

908
01:01:06,648 --> 01:01:09,193
<i>I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.</i>

909
01:01:10,695 --> 01:01:12,697
Play some music if you like.

910
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:15,992
I love this track.

911
01:01:17,284 --> 01:01:19,871
<i>I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.</i>

912
01:01:20,454 --> 01:01:21,581
Yes, Mullet?

913
01:01:21,914 --> 01:01:27,253
<i>I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawn shop in Smith Street.</i>

914
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:29,297
Better not be telling me porky pies.

915
01:01:29,547 --> 01:01:34,927
<i>I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.</i>

916
01:01:35,427 --> 01:01:37,554
<i>It's very effective, Tony.</i>

917
01:01:37,847 --> 01:01:39,849
<i>It's not too subtle, but effective.</i>

918
01:01:41,516 --> 01:01:42,936
Are we taking him with us?

919
01:01:52,195 --> 01:01:53,320
<i>It's the Russian.</i>

920
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:55,447
A Russian?

921
01:01:55,697 --> 01:01:58,326
<i>To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.</i>

922
01:01:58,617 --> 01:02:03,121
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

923
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:05,625
- Give me a name.
- Yurinov.

924
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:07,251
Boris.

925
01:02:07,793 --> 01:02:09,336
- Boris The Blade?
- Yeah.

926
01:02:09,628 --> 01:02:12,465
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

927
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:16,385
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

928
01:02:17,387 --> 01:02:19,764
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

929
01:02:21,641 --> 01:02:24,643
<i>He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...</i>

930
01:02:24,893 --> 01:02:26,563
<i>... and you nicked all our savings.</i>

931
01:02:27,021 --> 01:02:31,025
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

932
01:02:31,943 --> 01:02:35,822
<i>He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.</i>

933
01:02:36,072 --> 01:02:38,407
<i>- Are you taking the piss?
- What can I do?</i>

934
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:40,827
<i>I can't make him do it, can I?</i>

935
01:02:41,077 --> 01:02:44,204
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

936
01:02:49,293 --> 01:02:53,255
<i>He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.</i>

937
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:56,800
I want that pikey to fight.

938
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:24,536
<i>Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...</i>

939
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:27,831
<i>... might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.</i>

940
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:31,001
<i>And if that wasn't enough...</i>

941
01:03:31,418 --> 01:03:33,713
<i>... he thought it would be
a good idea...</i>

942
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:36,715
<i>... to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.</i>

943
01:03:38,425 --> 01:03:39,927
<i>While she was asleep in it.</i>

944
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:39,195
Turkish, get your arse up.

945
01:04:39,903 --> 01:04:40,780
You lot...

946
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:43,992
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

947
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:47,911
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

948
01:04:48,204 --> 01:04:52,125
<i>I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.</i>

949
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,793
What?

950
01:04:54,543 --> 01:04:56,920
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

951
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,025
Jesus.

952
01:05:17,275 --> 01:05:18,735
Sorry, Mickey.

953
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:21,445
Did you do it?

954
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:28,119
Then what are you sorry for?

955
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:31,748
- What are you two doing here?
- Come back!

956
01:05:31,998 --> 01:05:34,833
- You got some tars on you.
- Fuck off, Darren.

957
01:05:35,793 --> 01:05:37,128
Fuck off!

958
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:46,304
<i>How silly do I feel?</i>

959
01:05:46,804 --> 01:05:49,431
<i>His mum is still smoking
next to us...</i>

960
01:05:49,681 --> 01:05:51,726
<i>... and I'm asking him to fight.</i>

961
01:05:53,101 --> 01:05:55,730
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

962
01:05:56,356 --> 01:05:58,148
<i>And if he'd said no...</i>

963
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,818
<i>... it could've been
a shite sight worse.</i>

964
01:06:06,782 --> 01:06:08,326
Russians.

965
01:06:13,789 --> 01:06:15,166
Russians.

966
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:16,876
I should've known.

967
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:21,047
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

968
01:06:21,297 --> 01:06:23,340
What do you know about this goyim?

969
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:25,592
Ex-KGB cancer.

970
01:06:26,302 --> 01:06:28,512
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

971
01:06:28,762 --> 01:06:31,139
He'll be impossible to track down.

972
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:33,059
Yeah.

973
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:36,938
<i>There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.</i>

974
01:06:37,188 --> 01:06:39,731
<i>- Where's he from?
- I don't know. Hard to tell.</i>

975
01:06:39,983 --> 01:06:41,275
<i>He's got a thick Russian accent.</i>

976
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:58,251
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

977
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,463
<i>That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.</i>

978
01:07:02,713 --> 01:07:05,173
First things first. One of us...

979
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:10,597
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

980
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:12,264
Now.

981
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:21,398
<i>He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.</i>

982
01:07:21,648 --> 01:07:24,777
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

983
01:07:25,027 --> 01:07:26,695
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

984
01:07:27,655 --> 01:07:29,489
Not a problem.

985
01:07:31,326 --> 01:07:32,994
Get me to a doctor.

986
01:07:33,244 --> 01:07:36,039
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

987
01:07:36,331 --> 01:07:38,208
Okay, but first we get the stone.

988
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,585
First the stone. Then a doctor.

989
01:07:40,835 --> 01:07:43,713
<i>And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.</i>

990
01:07:43,963 --> 01:07:46,048
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

991
01:07:50,177 --> 01:07:52,804
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

992
01:07:53,097 --> 01:07:57,476
- I think you got something to tell us.
- Take it easy, Rosebud.

993
01:07:57,726 --> 01:07:59,978
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

994
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:02,606
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

995
01:08:02,856 --> 01:08:06,443
<i>They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.</i>

996
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:09,364
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

997
01:08:10,447 --> 01:08:13,242
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

998
01:08:18,706 --> 01:08:21,000
- Yeah.
- Boris is here.

999
01:08:21,251 --> 01:08:24,337
<i>- We're coming over. Hold him there.
- Hold on!</i>

1000
01:08:24,587 --> 01:08:25,630
<i>He's not on his own!</i>

1001
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:33,136
We're off.

1002
01:08:37,766 --> 01:08:40,228
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1003
01:08:48,735 --> 01:08:51,322
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1004
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:56,034
So, where is he?

1005
01:08:56,286 --> 01:08:58,912
<i>It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.</i>

1006
01:08:59,162 --> 01:09:02,166
<i>- They locked Boris in the car.
- Why didn't you tell us that?</i>

1007
01:09:03,877 --> 01:09:04,918
Did they look hard?

1008
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:06,378
They looked messy.

1009
01:09:06,628 --> 01:09:09,465
<i>- Let's get out of here.
- What about the Russian?</i>

1010
01:09:09,756 --> 01:09:11,509
I want you to bury him.

1011
01:09:12,135 --> 01:09:13,136
All right.

1012
01:09:14,845 --> 01:09:17,055
I think we should get you a new gun.

1013
01:09:17,347 --> 01:09:19,225
But this time, try it.

1014
01:09:19,516 --> 01:09:21,435
How far to the Russian's?

1015
01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:23,229
Be there in a minute.

1016
01:09:29,402 --> 01:09:31,654
- Come on, then.
- No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1017
01:09:31,904 --> 01:09:34,823
<i>We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.</i>

1018
01:09:36,492 --> 01:09:38,953
<i>You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.</i>

1019
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:40,787
<i>Why? What's wrong with it?</i>

1020
01:09:41,038 --> 01:09:43,957
<i>- It's not in sync with evolution.
- Shut up.</i>

1021
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:45,585
How do we get rid of him?

1022
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:48,253
<i>- Do you want to shoot him?
- It's a little noisy.</i>

1023
01:09:48,503 --> 01:09:51,381
<i>- Do you want to stab him?
- That's a little cold-blooded.</i>

1024
01:09:51,632 --> 01:09:55,177
- Do you want to kill him or not?
- I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1025
01:09:55,427 --> 01:09:56,804
<i>That's the spirit.</i>

1026
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:58,514
Do they fire?

1027
01:09:58,805 --> 01:09:59,974
Of course they fire.

1028
01:10:00,225 --> 01:10:02,351
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1029
01:10:02,601 --> 01:10:04,561
What do you know about replicas?

1030
01:10:08,942 --> 01:10:10,902
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1031
01:10:11,152 --> 01:10:13,320
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1032
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:18,368
<i>I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!</i>

1033
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:21,162
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1034
01:10:21,412 --> 01:10:25,082
<i>Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.</i>

1035
01:10:25,332 --> 01:10:28,711
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1036
01:10:28,962 --> 01:10:31,421
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1037
01:10:31,672 --> 01:10:35,717
<i>The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.</i>

1038
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:38,845
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1039
01:10:39,096 --> 01:10:41,015
Let me do you a favour.

1040
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:47,145
Whoops.

1041
01:10:47,396 --> 01:10:48,814
You. Want a knife?

1042
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:51,192
<i>No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.</i>

1043
01:10:51,442 --> 01:10:53,610
<i>It's a knife, for God's sake.</i>

1044
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,154
<i>What's kept your fork company
all these years?</i>

1045
01:10:56,447 --> 01:10:59,701
The sharp side, the blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1046
01:11:22,097 --> 01:11:23,140
Is that Boris?

1047
01:11:41,074 --> 01:11:43,744
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1048
01:11:45,162 --> 01:11:46,538
What about Rosebud?

1049
01:11:46,788 --> 01:11:49,626
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1050
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:52,462
But which bit would you like?

1051
01:11:57,007 --> 01:11:58,009
They're getting out.

1052
01:11:59,135 --> 01:12:01,261
Get down and follow them.

1053
01:12:01,554 --> 01:12:03,514
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1054
01:12:03,765 --> 01:12:05,099
You're making a scene.

1055
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,935
<i>I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.</i>

1056
01:12:08,603 --> 01:12:11,439
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1057
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,149
<i>I can't leave him in here, can I?</i>

1058
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,199
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1059
01:12:23,826 --> 01:12:27,788
<i>I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.</i>

1060
01:12:28,122 --> 01:12:31,751
<i>- He's left the door open.
- Shouldn't think that's a good idea.</i>

1061
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:33,377
Should we go in?

1062
01:12:33,627 --> 01:12:37,090
<i>I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.</i>

1063
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:41,386
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1064
01:12:41,677 --> 01:12:45,097
<i>He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.</i>

1065
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:48,225
<i>I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.</i>

1066
01:12:48,518 --> 01:12:52,188
<i>I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.</i>

1067
01:12:52,814 --> 01:12:56,484
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1068
01:12:56,775 --> 01:13:00,445
Well, come on, then
before 'zee' Germans get here.

1069
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:02,907
<i>You just tell him who's in charge.</i>

1070
01:13:08,912 --> 01:13:10,122
Boris...

1071
01:13:15,502 --> 01:13:16,671
You certainly told him.

1072
01:13:23,802 --> 01:13:25,680
The Drowning Trout.

1073
01:13:27,765 --> 01:13:29,141
Come and pick us up.

1074
01:13:29,434 --> 01:13:30,475
And Doug...

1075
01:13:31,644 --> 01:13:33,186
...sharpish.

1076
01:13:53,457 --> 01:13:56,293
<i>I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...</i>

1077
01:13:56,586 --> 01:14:00,131
...but unless you give me what
I want there will be fucking murders.

1078
01:14:03,051 --> 01:14:03,926
<i>What's your name?</i>

1079
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:05,802
Shoot him.

1080
01:14:13,144 --> 01:14:16,814
Let go of the gun!

1081
01:14:22,737 --> 01:14:26,114
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1082
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:29,743
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1083
01:14:30,828 --> 01:14:32,872
There are two types of balls:

1084
01:14:33,622 --> 01:14:37,543
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1085
01:14:37,793 --> 01:14:40,296
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1086
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,091
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1087
01:14:44,341 --> 01:14:45,885
...but they're not clever.

1088
01:14:46,386 --> 01:14:49,471
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1089
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,643
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1090
01:14:53,976 --> 01:14:57,145
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1091
01:14:57,438 --> 01:15:00,858
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1092
01:15:02,609 --> 01:15:04,153
<i>There's no pussy here...</i>

1093
01:15:05,195 --> 01:15:08,658
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1094
01:15:09,367 --> 01:15:11,034
Like a prick...

1095
01:15:12,078 --> 01:15:13,621
...you're having second thoughts.

1096
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:16,457
You're shrinking.

1097
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,043
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1098
01:15:21,212 --> 01:15:24,882
<i>The fact that you've got ' Replica'
written on the side of your gun...</i>

1099
01:15:29,804 --> 01:15:34,309
<i>... and the fact that
I've got ' Desert Eagle.50'...</i>

1100
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,813
...written on the side of mine...

1101
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:45,485
...should precipitate...

1102
01:15:46,654 --> 01:15:50,490
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1103
01:15:52,827 --> 01:15:53,828
Now...

1104
01:15:56,622 --> 01:15:57,998
...fuck off.

1105
01:16:13,472 --> 01:16:14,932
Lock the door.

1106
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:16,475
Lock it!

1107
01:16:22,398 --> 01:16:23,649
Give me the case.

1108
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:26,027
Fuck you.

1109
01:16:27,028 --> 01:16:28,029
Shoot me.

1110
01:16:28,404 --> 01:16:30,448
I will. I'll shoot you.

1111
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:43,502
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1112
01:16:44,546 --> 01:16:46,046
You know what?

1113
01:16:46,338 --> 01:16:47,340
Fuck you too.

1114
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:51,261
<i>Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing
me a favour, you Russian fuck.</i>

1115
01:16:51,511 --> 01:16:54,221
You! Drop guns.

1116
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:55,722
Fuck you!

1117
01:16:56,224 --> 01:16:57,975
You drop your gun!

1118
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:00,561
Okay.

1119
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:02,564
Avi...

1120
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:03,981
...pull your socks up!

1121
01:17:17,203 --> 01:17:20,832
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it. We're out of here.

1122
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,542
Give me case.

1123
01:17:36,264 --> 01:17:37,472
Avi...

1124
01:17:38,432 --> 01:17:40,643
<i>... where's the case?
- Put the gun away.</i>

1125
01:17:42,228 --> 01:17:43,896
<i>What's Boris doing here?</i>

1126
01:17:45,105 --> 01:17:47,065
Boris, what are you doing here?

1127
01:17:47,317 --> 01:17:49,277
Fuck you!

1128
01:17:57,868 --> 01:17:59,287
<i>Where's the case?</i>

1129
01:18:00,747 --> 01:18:03,332
<i>- You piece of crap.
- Don't take the piss, Boris.</i>

1130
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:05,752
I'll show you.

1131
01:18:09,296 --> 01:18:10,881
Fuck you!

1132
01:18:14,844 --> 01:18:16,930
Almost had it.

1133
01:18:17,221 --> 01:18:19,015
<i>For fuck's sake.</i>

1134
01:18:23,228 --> 01:18:25,188
Fuck you and all.

1135
01:18:26,855 --> 01:18:29,567
You lucky bastard.

1136
01:18:35,405 --> 01:18:37,824
<i>Jeez, it's flawless.</i>

1137
01:18:38,493 --> 01:18:41,287
<i>Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.</i>

1138
01:18:41,621 --> 01:18:42,913
Leave the dog here.

1139
01:18:43,163 --> 01:18:47,793
<i>- Sol, why don't we just leave?
- Because life's too short, Vincent...</i>

1140
01:18:48,043 --> 01:18:50,880
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1141
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:54,551
<i>- Now leave that dog here.
- I'm gonna leave the dog here.</i>

1142
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:55,592
<i>Don't worry about it!</i>

1143
01:18:55,842 --> 01:18:59,639
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1144
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:02,266
<i>It's okay.</i>

1145
01:19:03,309 --> 01:19:05,060
Sit down. Down.

1146
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:13,027
<i>I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.</i>

1147
01:19:13,278 --> 01:19:15,529
<i>Well, we won't if you don't.</i>

1148
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,365
All right, you give me the stone...

1149
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:22,537
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1150
01:19:22,828 --> 01:19:26,875
<i>All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.</i>

1151
01:19:30,712 --> 01:19:31,880
Why is it down there?

1152
01:19:32,963 --> 01:19:35,925
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1153
01:19:36,175 --> 01:19:37,969
<i>You ain't from this planet, are you?</i>

1154
01:19:38,427 --> 01:19:42,180
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1155
01:19:42,431 --> 01:19:46,144
<i>... sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?</i>

1156
01:19:48,813 --> 01:19:52,734
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle.50.

1157
01:19:53,109 --> 01:19:55,485
What have they got to do
with anything?

1158
01:19:55,778 --> 01:19:57,947
They're both staring straight at me.

1159
01:20:01,074 --> 01:20:05,329
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1160
01:20:05,704 --> 01:20:06,747
Now, out of the car.

1161
01:20:07,289 --> 01:20:09,333
And leave your water pistols behind.

1162
01:20:10,251 --> 01:20:13,921
<i>Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.</i>

1163
01:20:14,213 --> 01:20:15,756
I'll think of something.

1164
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:21,470
<i>Why's he sweating?</i>

1165
01:20:23,847 --> 01:20:24,890
Oh, never mind.

1166
01:20:25,182 --> 01:20:27,685
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1167
01:20:27,935 --> 01:20:32,148
<i>- I'm a little worried, actually.
- Worried about what?</i>

1168
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:36,569
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1169
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,738
<i>I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?</i>

1170
01:20:39,029 --> 01:20:42,992
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1171
01:20:43,993 --> 01:20:47,829
<i>I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.</i>

1172
01:20:49,623 --> 01:20:53,670
<i>Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.</i>

1173
01:20:53,962 --> 01:20:56,130
<i>Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.</i>

1174
01:20:56,381 --> 01:21:00,051
<i>It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.</i>

1175
01:21:02,804 --> 01:21:05,681
<i>You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.</i>

1176
01:21:05,931 --> 01:21:09,394
<i>I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.</i>

1177
01:21:09,644 --> 01:21:12,689
<i>I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.</i>

1178
01:21:12,939 --> 01:21:15,567
<i>What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?</i>

1179
01:21:15,817 --> 01:21:18,152
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1180
01:21:18,403 --> 01:21:21,613
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1181
01:21:23,783 --> 01:21:25,743
So why are you so calm?

1182
01:21:26,743 --> 01:21:28,997
- I said...
- I heard what you said, Tommy!

1183
01:21:29,706 --> 01:21:32,417
<i>It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?</i>

1184
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:35,712
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1185
01:21:36,003 --> 01:21:40,466
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1186
01:21:41,634 --> 01:21:44,220
<i>Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.</i>

1187
01:22:24,176 --> 01:22:25,761
Oh, that fucking dog!

1188
01:22:27,221 --> 01:22:28,765
Go on, get the dog.

1189
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:32,935
<i>- It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
- Open a window.</i>

1190
01:22:41,152 --> 01:22:43,363
You people live like animals.

1191
01:22:43,904 --> 01:22:45,573
<i>Now, where's the stone?</i>

1192
01:22:45,864 --> 01:22:48,033
<i>- Come on, where is it?
- It's over here.</i>

1193
01:22:48,283 --> 01:22:51,371
- Where? Where?
- I left it in a box.

1194
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:57,627
<i>It's empty.</i>

1195
01:22:57,877 --> 01:23:00,963
<i>I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.</i>

1196
01:23:01,922 --> 01:23:04,007
<i>No, I'm being serious!</i>

1197
01:23:04,259 --> 01:23:06,719
The dog. The dog must have had it.

1198
01:23:10,472 --> 01:23:13,893
<i>Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.</i>

1199
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,854
- What?
- Look in the dog.

1200
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:22,193
<i>- You mean, ' look in the dog'?
- I mean, open him up.</i>

1201
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:29,868
<i>It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?</i>

1202
01:23:30,118 --> 01:23:32,119
You know what I mean.

1203
01:23:34,706 --> 01:23:35,707
<i>That's a bit strong.</i>

1204
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:38,751
<i>I don't know about this.</i>

1205
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:42,005
<i>No, you can't do this.</i>

1206
01:23:44,716 --> 01:23:46,091
<i>It's fucking squeaking!</i>

1207
01:23:46,341 --> 01:23:50,430
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1208
01:23:53,056 --> 01:23:54,725
<i>I'm shooting the dog!</i>

1209
01:24:02,984 --> 01:24:04,610
Shoot the fucking dog!

1210
01:24:15,454 --> 01:24:18,166
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1211
01:24:30,177 --> 01:24:31,179
Thank God for that.

1212
01:24:41,689 --> 01:24:44,984
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1213
01:24:47,945 --> 01:24:49,613
Tony, come on!

1214
01:24:57,956 --> 01:24:59,207
Tony?

1215
01:25:11,426 --> 01:25:14,180
<i>- Anything to declare?
- Yeah. Don't go to England.</i>

1216
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:20,728
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1217
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:23,064
<i>How's the dog gonna find the campsite?</i>

1218
01:25:23,355 --> 01:25:25,567
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1219
01:25:25,858 --> 01:25:28,778
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1220
01:25:29,028 --> 01:25:30,947
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1221
01:25:31,197 --> 01:25:34,492
<i>That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.</i>

1222
01:25:34,783 --> 01:25:39,872
<i>Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.</i>

1223
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:44,418
Mickey.

1224
01:25:46,503 --> 01:25:47,630
Mickey!

1225
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,135
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1226
01:25:55,012 --> 01:25:56,139
Need a drink.

1227
01:25:58,891 --> 01:26:00,268
<i>You can't give him a drink!</i>

1228
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,520
<i>It's not for him. It's for me.</i>

1229
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:10,153
Ah, mates. Amen.

1230
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:21,581
<i>He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.</i>

1231
01:26:22,582 --> 01:26:23,957
All right, Mickey?

1232
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:26,043
Mickey!

1233
01:26:30,506 --> 01:26:32,300
Need to have a shite!

1234
01:26:33,467 --> 01:26:38,222
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1235
01:26:38,472 --> 01:26:40,557
...shoot the bastards.

1236
01:26:42,769 --> 01:26:45,354
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1237
01:26:52,444 --> 01:26:53,820
All right, Tom.

1238
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:58,909
- Hope we get a better show this time.
- This will make up for it.

1239
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:01,453
<i>Mickey's going down in the fourth.</i>

1240
01:27:01,703 --> 01:27:04,207
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1241
01:27:04,498 --> 01:27:06,125
Now, you have to forgive me.

1242
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:09,002
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1243
01:27:12,256 --> 01:27:15,217
- Our lads at the campsite?
- They're over there now.

1244
01:27:18,512 --> 01:27:20,765
I fucking hate pikeys.

1245
01:27:22,766 --> 01:27:26,813
- How long have we gotta stay here?
- As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1246
01:27:27,896 --> 01:27:29,856
Fucking hate pikeys.

1247
01:27:31,024 --> 01:27:32,985
Is he fucking stoned?

1248
01:27:33,485 --> 01:27:35,488
<i>He's like that before a fight.</i>

1249
01:27:35,779 --> 01:27:38,115
Do you know when you're going down?

1250
01:27:38,365 --> 01:27:40,909
<i>Of course he knows
when he's going down.</i>

1251
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:45,414
<i>Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?</i>

1252
01:27:45,707 --> 01:27:48,292
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1253
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,920
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1254
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:54,506
- Not now.
- Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1255
01:27:54,716 --> 01:27:57,594
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

1256
01:27:57,844 --> 01:27:59,304
And there none a yours.

1257
01:28:00,637 --> 01:28:04,516
<i>There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.</i>

1258
01:28:04,766 --> 01:28:08,061
<i>Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.</i>

1259
01:28:09,605 --> 01:28:11,481
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1260
01:28:17,529 --> 01:28:20,992
<i>Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!</i>

1261
01:29:11,501 --> 01:29:14,546
<i>I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.</i>

1262
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:16,965
<i>Do your worst. Let's get it on!</i>

1263
01:29:48,453 --> 01:29:51,248
<i>What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?</i>

1264
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,167
Talk about saved by the bell.

1265
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:39,296
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1266
01:30:39,588 --> 01:30:41,841
<i>Do not knock him out, Mickey.</i>

1267
01:30:48,472 --> 01:30:50,182
<i>All right, let's break it up.</i>

1268
01:31:24,216 --> 01:31:25,635
What, is he fucking deaf?

1269
01:31:27,095 --> 01:31:28,845
What is he doing?

1270
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:45,947
Come on and sit.

1271
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:50,743
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1272
01:31:50,993 --> 01:31:53,078
You're dancing like a fairy.

1273
01:31:53,371 --> 01:31:55,998
<i>They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.</i>

1274
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:58,917
Get out there and hurt him.

1275
01:32:00,336 --> 01:32:05,216
<i>But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.</i>

1276
01:33:25,546 --> 01:33:28,423
<i>All he's got to do is stay down.</i>

1277
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:35,180
<i>Now, we are fucked.</i>

1278
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,439
<i>He can't stand up.</i>

1279
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:45,440
We're out of here.

1280
01:33:45,733 --> 01:33:50,822
<i>Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...</i>

1281
01:33:51,072 --> 01:33:53,533
<i>... sitting outside his campsite.</i>

1282
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:58,746
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1283
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,251
<i>Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?</i>

1284
01:34:03,501 --> 01:34:04,961
Give me that fucking shooter!

1285
01:34:05,252 --> 01:34:07,881
<i>And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.</i>

1286
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:09,298
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1287
01:34:09,923 --> 01:34:12,010
<i>Something very silly.</i>

1288
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:15,262
<i>You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...</i>

1289
01:34:15,512 --> 01:34:18,015
<i>... because you're too scared
to think.</i>

1290
01:34:18,307 --> 01:34:21,351
<i>You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.</i>

1291
01:34:21,644 --> 01:34:23,854
<i>But the pikey didn't. Why?</i>

1292
01:34:24,104 --> 01:34:26,899
<i>Because he had plans
on running the car over.</i>

1293
01:34:29,319 --> 01:34:31,404
<i>It had previously occurred to me...</i>

1294
01:34:31,695 --> 01:34:34,948
<i>... that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.</i>

1295
01:34:38,161 --> 01:34:40,872
<i>For every action,
there is a reaction.</i>

1296
01:34:41,163 --> 01:34:43,041
<i>And a pikey reaction...</i>

1297
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,083
<i>... is quite a fucking thing.</i>

1298
01:35:27,126 --> 01:35:29,170
Pete, talk to me.

1299
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:33,006
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1300
01:35:42,015 --> 01:35:45,561
- Give me that fucking shooter.
- I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1301
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:57,239
<i>That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.</i>

1302
01:35:58,283 --> 01:36:01,786
<i>That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.</i>

1303
01:36:03,579 --> 01:36:05,331
<i>We've been tucked up...</i>

1304
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,585
<i>... while he's been cleaning up.</i>

1305
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,338
<i>We're worse off now than
when we started.</i>

1306
01:36:18,845 --> 01:36:21,264
<i>The next day we went
to the campsite...</i>

1307
01:36:21,555 --> 01:36:24,684
<i>... but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.</i>

1308
01:36:24,934 --> 01:36:26,895
<i>Which was probably a good thing...</i>

1309
01:36:27,185 --> 01:36:31,565
<i>... considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.</i>

1310
01:36:31,899 --> 01:36:33,234
Where is he?

1311
01:36:33,525 --> 01:36:35,612
<i>He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.</i>

1312
01:36:36,445 --> 01:36:39,948
<i>We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?</i>

1313
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:43,453
<i>You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.</i>

1314
01:36:45,662 --> 01:36:48,875
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1315
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:52,252
Bollocks! Come on.

1316
01:36:57,550 --> 01:37:00,345
<i>- What you doing here?
- What's it got to do with you?</i>

1317
01:37:04,265 --> 01:37:06,391
So, what you doing here?

1318
01:37:14,024 --> 01:37:16,860
<i>I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?</i>

1319
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:19,447
<i>What's in the car?</i>

1320
01:37:20,155 --> 01:37:21,658
Seats and a steering wheel.

1321
01:37:22,824 --> 01:37:24,618
What do you know about gypsies?

1322
01:37:26,412 --> 01:37:28,372
I know they're not to be trusted.

1323
01:37:30,457 --> 01:37:33,127
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1324
01:37:34,002 --> 01:37:35,505
Get the dog, Tommy.

1325
01:37:37,381 --> 01:37:38,632
The dog.

1326
01:37:40,217 --> 01:37:44,680
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1327
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:47,100
He loves that dog.

1328
01:37:47,475 --> 01:37:49,185
Always playing silly games.

1329
01:37:49,435 --> 01:37:52,814
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1330
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:59,444
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1331
01:38:10,247 --> 01:38:11,748
Could you tell me...

1332
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:15,252
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1333
01:38:15,878 --> 01:38:16,880
Hey, George...

1334
01:38:18,297 --> 01:38:20,466
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

1335
01:38:23,886 --> 01:38:26,305
<i>Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?</i>

1336
01:38:36,231 --> 01:38:38,775
<i>Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.</i>

1337
01:38:39,027 --> 01:38:42,654
<i>I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.</i>

1338
01:38:42,905 --> 01:38:45,365
<i>I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.</i>

1339
01:38:45,658 --> 01:38:48,994
<i>The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...</i>

1340
01:38:49,244 --> 01:38:52,539
<i>... and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.</i>

1341
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:55,667
<i>It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.</i>

1342
01:38:56,085 --> 01:38:58,046
<i>Still didn't shut it up, though.</i>

1343
01:38:58,962 --> 01:39:00,797
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1344
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:03,967
<i>You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.</i>

1345
01:39:04,219 --> 01:39:05,761
So, what do you think?

1346
01:39:07,555 --> 01:39:09,724
<i>Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?</i>

1347
01:39:14,645 --> 01:39:15,479
I might.
