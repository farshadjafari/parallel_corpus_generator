2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,600
We can't hold out much longer,
sir!

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,000
General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!

4
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,640
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

5
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:26,400
Goddam it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost 15 men already!

6
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
Sir, they're lightin' us up
like a firestorm!

7
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,239
This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

8
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:34,799
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

9
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,400
They're not coming for us,
are they, sir?

10
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,400
Congressman Weaver
and esteemed members of the
Special Armed Services Committee,

11
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,000
I come before you to protest
a grave injustice.

12
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,598
Aim!

13
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,800
It has to stop.

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I miss you so much.

15
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,919
There's something I've gotta do,
Barb.

16
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,718
Something I couldn't do
while you were here.

17
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,520
I tried.
You know I tried everything.

18
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,680
And I still don't have
their attention.

19
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,479
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

20
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,878
But whatever happens,

21
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,318
please don't think less
of me.

22
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Marine,
inform the garrison C.O...

23
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,920
that General Hummel's coming on board
with a security inspection team.

24
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes, sir. Sir, it's an honour
having you, sir.

25
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,079
Ya know, at least
we can get some...

26
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,079
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

27
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,639
I got the access card. We've got
30 minutes till those darts wear off.

28
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,759
Move it!

29
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,240
The access card, sir.

30
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,680
Let's do it.

31
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,560
Twenty-four hundred
magazine check.

32
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,040
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

33
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,879
Clear!

34
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,879
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

35
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,560
Evac!
Seal the door!

36
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,759
- No!
- Come on, man!
- No!

37
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,560
- No!
- Seal it!
- Help!

38
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,000
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

39
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,079
Let me out! Let me out!

40
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,079
Clear out.
Get outta here!

41
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,360
Sorry.

42
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,720
Let's move out.

43
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,759
Two more cc's
of acetylene chloride.

44
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,720
- That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.
- You suck.

45
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,920
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

46
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,759
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

47
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,920
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

48
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,959
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

49
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,199
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $13 on a CD, man?

50
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

51
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,759
And second,
these sound better.

52
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,720
Could be serious.
Could be sarin gas.

53
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,720
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

54
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
postmarked to
a Bosnian refugee camp.

55
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,959
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

56
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,320
Bosnian refugee camp?

57
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,639
Half a million Serbians reside
in the U.S., Marvin.
Serbians don't like Bosnians.

58
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:38,840
You guys wanna get
suited up?

59
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,320
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

60
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,440
We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

61
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:55,798
October 1, 0900 hours.

62
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,440
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood...

63
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,678
initiating exam
of wooden crate.

64
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,080
Suspicion of
sarin gas inside.

65
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,519
- Marvin, sarin is a...
- G.B. aerosol.

66
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,278
That is correct.

67
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
Now, let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

68
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,480
Stone Age Cave Girls
in the Raw.

69
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,519
Kinky. And, uh...
Not a good sign.

70
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:20,639
Hello, little baby doll.

71
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:22,678
Lookit, Stan.

72
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,798
- Hi there,
- Marvin!
- Stanley.

73
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,759
- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!

74
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,678
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

75
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,038
We'll have that room clear
in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

76
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,038
Jesus Christ!

77
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:41,918
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

78
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,278
The bad news is that the gas
is corrosive and it's eating our suits.

79
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,360
- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news...

80
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,000
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

81
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,038
- and kill everybody in the building.
- Detonation too heavy.
- Everybody, out of the room now!

82
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,440
Seal us inside.

83
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,120
- Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
- The acid's eating my su...

84
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,519
It's eating my fucking suit!
All right? Shit!

85
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:10,678
- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?

86
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,720
We're working on it. It's coming.
It's just a flow problem.

87
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,519
Well, that's a pretty big
friggin' problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

88
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:18,639
- We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?
- A minute ten.

89
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,840
- Look at this!
- We're gonna have the room clear.

90
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,879
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, Isherwood.

91
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:26,600
- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

92
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,798
- Marvin, the atropine, now!
- Inject it in your heart
before your suit melts.

93
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,278
Shit!

94
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,120
Make him take his dose.

95
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,440
- Where's that water?
- Get that away from me!

96
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,918
Come on, Phil, fix it
for Christ's sake!

97
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,759
- Take the atropine now, Stan,
for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

98
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,240
The poison's mixing.

99
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,000
What the fuck are you
waiting for, Stanley?
You take the fucking needle now!

100
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:53,600
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

101
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,000
If that suit melts...
If you die, we all die!

102
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,519
Inject your heart
and then diffuse the bomb!

103
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:02,639
- Come on, just do it, Stan!
- Shit! What if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

104
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:07,480
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is. You want
me to stick this into my heart?

105
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,918
- Are you fucking nuts?
- The sprinkler's coming!
It's coming!

106
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,038
Okay, here we go, man!

107
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,558
Sprinkler activated.

108
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,519
How much time left?

109
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,678
Twenty seconds!

110
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,759
We're not gonna make it.

111
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,918
Fifteen.

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480
Oh, come on.

113
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,759
Clear!

114
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,120
Get me the fuck
out of this gas chamber!

115
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,558
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.

116
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,000
Please lock me away

117
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:47,399
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

118
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,000
Hi, baby.

119
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:54,158
Here inside where I hide
with my loneliness

120
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,678
I had such
an interesting day today.

121
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
Oh, okay, you go first.

123
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,558
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies,

124
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,600
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

125
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,240
So I took
the rest of the day off.

126
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
Glass of wine, little guitar.
Just relaxing.

127
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,519
- Wow!
- I mean it, honey. The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

128
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:23,558
I really believe that anyone
who's even thinking about
having a child in this world...

129
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,038
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

130
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,879
I know, I'm rambling,
I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

131
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:33,158
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

132
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm sorry?

133
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,240
I'm pregnant.

134
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:43,759
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:46,720
- Wow!
- Is that all you're gonna say,
is "wow"?

136
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,200
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

137
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
How do you know? I mean,
h-how do you know?

138
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,918
Blue! Just turned blue
so I went to the doctor.

139
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,918
- Well, you didn't mean what
you just said, did you?
- When?

140
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,000
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

141
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,879
and having it be
an act of cruelty.

142
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:09,798
- I meant it at the time.
- Stanley, at the time? You said it
seven and a half seconds ago.

143
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,158
Well, gosh!

144
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

145
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,399
- I know. It's funny
you should mention that.
- It's funny?

146
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:23,440
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

147
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,558
Good.

148
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,840
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa! Whoa! Wai...
Hey, Marriage Police, pull over!

149
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,759
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

150
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,879
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

151
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,360
Is it really true that
there's never been an escape?

152
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,480
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until
'63 when the prison closed,

153
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,320
there were 14 attempts.

154
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,840
No one is believed to have made
it to shore, alive at least.

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,960
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

156
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,399
- I don't really give a shit!
Do you give a shit?
- No.

157
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:10,840
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

158
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,639
- Hey, girls? Hi.
You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

159
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:17,480
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

160
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,480
I need you to tell your teacher
that you need to get back on
the boat and go home right now.

161
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,639
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

162
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,639
This cell block housed...

163
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:30,158
the most awesome scum
in America.

164
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,759
Ladies and gentlemen,
l, Ranger Bob,

165
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:37,360
cordially invite you to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

166
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,240
On the line!

167
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:46,639
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

168
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,000
Like being a caged animal.

169
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,558
Spend a couple of years
in there...

170
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,759
- What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?
- The tour's over, Bob.

171
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,918
What kind of fucked-up tour
is this?

172
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:19,960
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

173
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,678
Welcome to The Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the
back side and deploy as planned.

174
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,038
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

175
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,038
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun.

176
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,759
Oh, you're not allowed to carry
a gun? I got a goddam gun.

177
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:34,440
If I'd've known this was
gonna happen, I'd have brought
my motherfuckin' gun! Help!

178
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,720
All right, gentlemen, this'll be
our new home. Tom, I want
my command centre right here.

179
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,558
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

180
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,840
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

181
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,798
Let's move it.

182
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:09,879
- Systems up.
- Possible penetration point
in the shower room.

183
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:13,200
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch, sir.

184
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,158
It's an anti-motion trembler
device. It's custom-made.

185
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,759
Nobody knows about it
and nobody expects it.

186
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:23,080
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

187
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,000
And then if they disturb
Mr Backup here, we own 'em.

188
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:43,558
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're being detained against your will.

189
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,558
For that, I apologize.

190
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,960
It is not our intention
in any way to harm you.

191
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,278
You will not be detained one
minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

192
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,798
Attention on deck!

193
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,440
Stand easy, men.

194
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,118
Make no mistake about it,
gentlemen, we are now in harm's way.

195
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:12,318
For Major Baxter and l,
this is the last campaign in
a career datin' back to Tet '68.

196
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,480
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

197
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,200
who cut their teeth under
my command in Desert Storm.

198
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:23,720
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow,
this is my first operational
situation with you and your men.

199
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,118
And I have to say, thus far your conduct
reflects your reputations.

200
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,400
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

201
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,838
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

202
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,920
To this
we must now add resolve.

203
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:37,318
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

204
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Punishable by death.

205
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,680
A couple hundred years ago,

206
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,200
a few guys named Washington,
Jefferson and Adams...

207
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:48,480
were branded as traitors
by the British.

208
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,240
And now
they're called patriots.

209
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,278
In time, so shall we.

210
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
God willing,
in less than 48 hours...

211
00:17:57,358 --> 00:18:02,400
you will evacuate this island
in gunships under cover of
hostages and V.X. gas warheads.

212
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,798
Your destination: a
non-extradition treaty country.

213
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,278
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

214
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,960
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

215
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:17,519
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

216
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,558
The men of
Marine Force Recon...

217
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,118
are selected to carry out
illegal operations throughout the world.

218
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,440
When they don't come home,

219
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:31,118
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

220
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,318
and denied compensation.

221
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,680
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career!

222
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,200
Well, here and now
the lies stop!

223
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:48,400
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

224
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,440
This is FBl Director Womack.

225
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:57,960
Director, be advised.

226
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:00,680
Eighty-one,
I say again,

227
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:04,440
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

228
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:08,598
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

229
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,038
Who is this?

230
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,759
Mr Director, you have
a very serious problem.

231
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,480
A battery of V.X. gas rockets
is presently deployed...

232
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,680
to deliver a highly
lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

233
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:23,960
- I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.
- I want to know who I'm talking to.

234
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:28,038
This is Brigadier General
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

235
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,798
Out!

236
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,318
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

237
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,118
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

238
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,920
Last night General Hummel, using
brutal but nonlethal force...

239
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:47,920
under the guise of a security
exercise, walked off with 15
V.X. poison gas rockets.

240
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:50,038
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

241
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,720
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

242
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,838
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

243
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,680
Three Purple Hearts,
two Silver Stars...

244
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:02,440
and the Congressional Medal
of...

245
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:05,598
Jesus!
This man is a hero!

246
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,118
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr Sinclair.

247
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:11,480
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

248
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,920
Mr Sinclair, General Hummel
is a man of honour.

249
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,078
General, it's him.

250
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,000
Frank, it's Al Kramer.

251
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,880
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

252
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,200
I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.

253
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,519
Got a lot of very, very
worried people here, Frank.

254
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,920
I'll come straight
to the point.

255
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:33,318
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

256
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,680
Forty-seven in northern Laos
and southern China.

257
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:38,838
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

258
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,078
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

259
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,960
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

260
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,598
- How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I'm 33.

261
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,720
Well, Mr Sinclair, you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

262
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,078
By your ninth birthday, I was
runnin' black ops into China,

263
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,038
and my men were responsible
f-for over 200 enemy kills.

264
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,798
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr
Sinclair's mouth. He's wasting my time.

265
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,318
Ah, you want to continue,
Frank?

266
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

267
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,200
Those surgical hits made by
our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

268
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:14,759
It was my men on the ground
that made those hits possible
by lasing the targets.

269
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,160
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

270
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,680
No benefits were paid
to their families.

271
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:24,038
No medals conferred.

272
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,880
These men died for their
country, and they weren't even
given a goddam military burial.

273
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,278
The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million...

274
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,038
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea
Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

275
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,759
From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid...

276
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,278
to each of
the 83 Marines' families.

277
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,640
The rest of the funds I will
disperse at my discretion.

278
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,160
Do I make myself clear?

279
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:52,240
Except for the Red Sea
Trading Company. What is that?

280
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBl Director Womack, General.

281
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:58,759
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

282
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,278
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

283
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,920
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

284
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:07,640
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

285
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,440
You've got 40 hours, till noon
day after tomorrow to arrange
transfer of the money.

286
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:15,278
I am aware of your
countermeasure. You know and l
know it doesn't stand a chance.

287
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,038
Hummel from Alcatraz.
Out.

288
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,759
All right. We have to identify
the hostages and contact each
of their families.

289
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,640
Uh, tell 'em somethin'.
Make up a story, and we've got
to keep this undercover.

290
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:31,759
If this comes out, the city
of San Francisco will be
in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

291
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,278
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

292
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,318
for a single rocket armed with
V.X. poison gas, General Peterson?

293
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,358
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

294
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,118
- Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!
- Oh.

295
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:52,680
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

296
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,440
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

297
00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:59,358
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

298
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,680
Get the point?

299
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,200
Uh, what did Hummel mean
by your countermeasure, General?

300
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:08,318
Standard poison is countered
by napalm. It burns it up,
consumes it upon detonation.

301
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
Now, the problem
with V.X. poison gas is...

302
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,038
that it's designed specifically
to withstand napalm.

303
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,480
That's where, uh, thermite plasma
comes in. General Peterson?

304
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,240
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume V.X.,

305
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,759
but they're still in the test
phase; it's not operational.

306
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,118
Hummel knows this. We are dealing
with one smart son of a bitch.

307
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:31,838
What's it gonna take to equip a flight
of F-18s with thermite plasma...

308
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,558
within the next 36 hours?

309
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,038
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

310
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:40,078
All right, we can try.

311
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,400
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

312
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:45,640
Then we have to go to
our primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

313
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:49,118
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Commander Anderson.

314
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,720
Mr Womack, who is your best
chemical/biological man?

315
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,720
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

316
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,118
- You like my pigtails?
- Oh, yeah, the pigtails
are very naughty.

317
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,960
Naughty. Naughty.

318
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:14,278
Just the Amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

319
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,680
- This isn't happening.
- No, Stan, don't answer it.

320
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:19,680
- This isn't happening!
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

321
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:22,400
- I have to. It's the office,
baby. They know I'm home.
- No.

322
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,038
How could they possibly know
that you're home?

323
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,240
It's the FBl.

324
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,200
Stanley!

325
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:33,798
Goodspeed.
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

326
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,160
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah,
downstairs in ten minutes.

327
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:38,640
No, you won't.

328
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,200
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

329
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,278
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

330
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,358
Are you kidding me right now?
You need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

331
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,920
- I've got to go, baby.
- Oh! I am Catholic!
Do you realize that?

332
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:58,038
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And
this causes a serious problem for me.

333
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,038
I cannot believe you.

334
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,519
No, no.

335
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,759
I love you.
I will marry you.

336
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,480
I just didn't plan on this,
that's all.

337
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,440
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

338
00:25:22,598 --> 00:25:24,358
Yeah, I'm sure it's just
a training exercise.

339
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,680
Check into the hotel.
Order up some champagne.

340
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:28,680
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

341
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:30,440
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

342
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:33,160
You're gonna marry me!

343
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,838
- Oh, honey, come on.
Just a really quick one.
- Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

344
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,880
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out due to the full moon.

345
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,798
Likewise a frontal
seaside attack.

346
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,078
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

347
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,720
Our only alternative is an
attack from within the prison.

348
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,160
We penetrate the island
through the tunnels under the
prison buildings undetected...

349
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:54,078
and emerge in its centre; that way
we can jump the Marines from behind.

350
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,759
And if we're lucky, take their
rocket positions without a shot fired.

351
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,200
I don't understand. You-you've studied
the architectural plans?

352
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:04,078
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

353
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,038
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

354
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,519
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

355
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,838
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

356
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,960
All the guards we contacted
were useless.

357
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:19,838
Um, there is someone
who I think can help us.

358
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,880
- This is for the sake
of national security.
- No!

359
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,519
It's the sake of national
security that got us here
in the first place 33 years ago.

360
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,318
I knew! I knew someday
this would come back to bite us.

361
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,160
Forget it!
He does not exist.

362
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:37,598
He does exist! We just chose
to forget him for 30 years.

363
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,680
- We locked him up
and threw away the key.
- Oh, and a lot of goddam good it did us.

364
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:44,358
He broke out of two maximum security
prisons. And if he hits the streets...

365
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,680
He's not gonna hit the streets,
Jim.

366
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,680
Thirty years ago he was
a highly trained SAS operative.

367
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:51,480
He is my age now,
for Christ's sake!

368
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,318
I have to get up three times
a night to take a piss.

369
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,440
We can't risk
letting him out.

370
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:01,000
He's a professional
escape artist.

371
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,558
- Gosh. Neat, uh...
- Yeah.
- Neat, neat plane.

372
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,880
Dr Goodspeed.
James Womack.

373
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:39,558
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

374
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,400
You come
very highly recommended.

375
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:44,838
B.A. Columbia;
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

376
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,920
Biochemistry, toxicology.

377
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:49,440
Well, I'm one of those fortunate
people who like my job, sir.

378
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:52,240
Got my first chemistry set
when I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

379
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,160
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

380
00:27:55,318 --> 00:27:56,960
What do you know
about V.X. gas?

381
00:27:57,118 --> 00:28:00,240
Liquid. Failed pesticide
discovered by a mistake in 1952.

382
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,838
Uh, actually, it's kind of like
champagne that way.

383
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,598
The Franciscan monks thought
they were making white wine.

384
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,440
Somehow the bottle carbonated.
Voila! Champagne.

385
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:08,000
- And then the whole thing just...
- The gas, Dr Goodspeed.

386
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,240
It's very, very horrible,
sir.

387
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,278
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

388
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:16,038
This isn't a "train" exercise,
is it?

389
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,400
No, Dr Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

390
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:57,960
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning, Director.

391
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:00,720
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

392
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,798
- Dr Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

393
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,118
It's been a fairly interesting day
so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

394
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,038
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.
Who is he anyway, sir?

395
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,880
His name is John Mason,
a British national...

396
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,759
incarcerated on Alcatraz
in 1962, escaped in '63.

397
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,358
I was under the impression that no one
ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

398
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,598
Paxton, don't argue!

399
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,640
This man has no identity, not
in the United States or Great Britain.

400
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:31,200
He does not exist.
Understand?

401
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:33,440
I want one thing:
how he escaped The Rock.

402
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:36,480
Specifically the route he took
through the island's bowels.

403
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,838
- The papers are in order, sir.
- We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

404
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,358
And Paxton, no strong-arming
Mason. I know him too well.

405
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,720
Well, if you know him,
then why don't you question him?

406
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,278
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

407
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,759
All right,
I'll take care of him.

408
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,838
Mr Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

409
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,038
In charge of what? Fucking me
over for another three decades?

410
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

411
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,960
a special situation exists that we
feel you might be able to help us with.

412
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:17,240
Well, what might that be?

413
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,480
I've been in jail longer than
Nelson Mandela, so maybe you
want me to run for president.

414
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,240
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

415
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,720
I feel rather
like Alcamedes.

416
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,000
- Who?
- Alcamedes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

417
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,160
- Like Sir Walter Raleigh.
The same fate.
- James the First.

418
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:38,640
Even someone as bright as you
must be aware that, uh,

419
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,838
there's a certain pattern
emerging here.

420
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,960
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

421
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:46,278
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play
hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

422
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,400
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

423
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,118
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

424
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

425
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,680
You wanna hear what
I have to say or not?

426
00:30:56,838 --> 00:31:01,278
By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.

427
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,598
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

428
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,400
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

429
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:09,838
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

430
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,240
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

431
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,118
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know The Rock.

432
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:19,440
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

433
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:22,400
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself
a favour while you're helpin' us?

434
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,240
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

435
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,358
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil.

436
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,680
While I'm considering
your offer,

437
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:36,798
I want a suite
in the Fairmont Hotel.

438
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,480
You know I'm here
to cut you a deal.

439
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,519
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

440
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,240
Here. Here's a quarter.

441
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,880
Do yourself a favour. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

442
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:01,759
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

443
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

444
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,720
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think we have time...

445
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,160
for him to just sit around
and think about it.

446
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:10,358
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.

447
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,519
- You go talk to him.
- Me?
- Yes.

448
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,078
- Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- You're an FBl agent!

449
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,200
- W-What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.

450
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:19,920
Don't mention that!

451
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,480
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

452
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,318
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

453
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,798
Okay.

454
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:40,720
Hi.

455
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,680
I'm an agent with the, uh,
uh, F-Federal...

456
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,519
FBl. Uh...

457
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,200
- Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

458
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:53,680
Well, at least
he got his name right.

459
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:57,358
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

460
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,680
That's right.

461
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:02,920
And you need my help.

462
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:04,598
Exactly right.

463
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,240
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

464
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
Offer me coffee.

465
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,838
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next...

466
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,558
Can we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

467
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,278
And offer
to take these off.

468
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:22,920
Mr Mason, really.

469
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:26,318
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

470
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,598
- Prisoner requests to have
his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no, no.

471
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,920
Why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?

472
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:39,558
Well, I guess
that's one way to go.

473
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:45,558
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

474
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,519
Now, it makes you a free man
provided you cooperate.

475
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,838
So if you'll just, uh,
sign,

476
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,838
uh, at, uh,
where it says...

477
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,038
- "Signature"?
- That's... Yes. "Signature."

478
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,880
Well, timeo danaos
et dona ferentis.

479
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:05,880
"l fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

480
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:08,480
Oh, an educated man!

481
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,440
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

482
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,280
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr Mason.

483
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,599
- Really?
- Yes.

484
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,199
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

485
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,199
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

486
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,039
Well-trained.

487
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,960
Then it's
the Fairmont Hotel.

488
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,360
Okay.

489
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:40,199
I want a suite,
a shower, a shave...

490
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,079
and the feel of a suit.

491
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,239
May I also suggest, uh,
a haircut?

492
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,480
- Am I out of style?
- Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

493
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,679
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

494
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,639
Yeah, well, uh, uh...
Okay, thank you very much.

495
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,199
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,
but I want him sealed off.

496
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,119
And he gets two hours max.

497
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,400
- Great job, Goodspeed.
- Why didn't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you were at it?

498
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:22,800
- I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.
- Uh, no, you'll give it to me.

499
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,518
And take Attorney Reynolds
outside. There's a car
waiting for you. Thank you.

500
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,159
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

501
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,679
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

502
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,960
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

503
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:45,159
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know
basis, and you don't need to know.

504
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,159
It's, uh, it's, eh,
kind of curious, but, uh,

505
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,440
Sir Walter Raleigh,
Alcamedes, Solzhenitsyn,

506
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,280
they, um, well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

507
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,800
Womack! Now, why am I not
surprised, you piece of shit!

508
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,079
Eh, peace! Peace!

509
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,518
Hey, we're not home.
Leave a message.

510
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,679
Hi, darling, it's, uh,
it's me.

511
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,679
Uh, listen, don't come
to San Francisco.

512
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,119
I repeat, do not come
to San Francisco.

513
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,719
- Stanley, no!
- Carla.
- Wha...

514
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,199
- Carla.
- Like hell I'm not coming!

515
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,639
Wait. Car...

516
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,639
Who's Carla? And why don't you want her
to come to San Francisco?

517
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,280
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

518
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,199
Watch it, he'll bite you.

519
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,480
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

520
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,960
- We'll be there in
approximately two hours.
- I'm not armed, sir.

521
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,559
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

522
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,760
I left it in my,
uh, my sock drawer.

523
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,639
A gun?

524
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,239
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

525
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,639
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually. But I still need a gun.

526
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,760
Give him a goddam gun.

527
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,639
Have you fired one of
those things since the Academy?

528
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,639
- Wear some
- If you're going to
- Flowers in your hair

529
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,280
Don't forget to wear
flowers in your hair

530
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,800
- If you're going
- If you're going

531
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,280
- To San Francisco
- To San Francisco

532
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,719
- You're sure to meet some
- You're gonna meet
- Gentle people there

533
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,280
- Some gentle people there
- And you come for...

534
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,159
If you're going
to San Francisco

535
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,559
Uh, uh, room service?

536
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:03,920
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

537
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,159
Hello!

538
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,400
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

539
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,920
Barber.

540
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,760
- Just clippers. No scissors.
- No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors!

541
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,039
I mean, did they tell Picasso,
"No brush"?

542
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,880
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

543
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,559
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can I?

544
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,599
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

545
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,679
Oh, who did this to you? This is just
not right. In fact, it's nasty!

546
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,518
Well, it's a grunge thing.

547
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,679
Well, it's some kind
of thing.

548
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,559
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some colour?

549
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,800
No.

550
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,599
Okay.
Not very nice, is he?

551
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,559
No, he's not.

552
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,880
'Cause I'm leavin'

553
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:06,239
Hey, somebody ordered it.
Can't let it go to waste.

554
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,079
- Don't know when I'll be back again
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?

555
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:11,480
Not when it's free.

556
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,679
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

557
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,559
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on,
have... Try some of this lobster.

558
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,800
- Mm-hmm.
- My secretary here
will settle the bill.

559
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,079
So what do you have in store for
me, Womack, when this is over?

560
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,920
You'll get your life back,
Mason.

561
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,760
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

562
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,280
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

563
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,400
Will you shake on it?

564
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,679
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

565
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,360
Help!

566
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:01,199
Drop the gun
or I drop your boss.

567
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,360
You will not!

568
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:06,239
Get!

569
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,840
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

570
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,920
Please don't!

571
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,679
Help! Shit!

572
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,400
Come on, have a scallop.
Come on, catch.

573
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,320
You hoist him!

574
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,280
Help! Help! Help!

575
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

576
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,679
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

577
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,639
Clear.

578
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,400
Living room's clear!

579
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:48,639
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

580
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,480
All units, this is Caretaker.
We have a Signal Six.
He's in the hotel!

581
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:01,719
Okay, I don't wanna know
nothin'. I never saw you throw
that gentleman off the balcony.

582
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,840
All I care about is, a-are
you happy with your haircut?

583
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,239
Easy!

584
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,440
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

585
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,039
Watch out!

586
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,440
Oh, no!

587
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,239
Watch it!

588
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,760
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

589
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:56,400
Hey!

590
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,800
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches,
or I'll have your ass. Hey!

591
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,440
Hey! Stop! Hey!

592
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,518
Hey, I was inside the bedroom
with Jack Powell!

593
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:12,239
Hey, call the guard! Go!

594
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,199
FBl.

595
00:42:27,518 --> 00:42:29,079
Move!

596
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,079
Whoa! Whoa!

597
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,559
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

598
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,679
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

599
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:53,920
Get out of the way!

600
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,280
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

601
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,840
This guy's hittin'
every fuckin' thing in sight
tryin' to block us!

602
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,159
I hope you're insured!

603
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,559
Oh, well, why not?

604
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,000
You're goin' down!

605
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,280
Hello?

606
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,719
I'm only borrowing
your Humvee!

607
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,159
Information?
San Francisco?

608
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,239
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G...

609
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,599
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

610
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,920
Hang on!

611
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,199
Holy shit!

612
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:43,719
Whoa-oa!

613
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,159
Oh, no!

614
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,119
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

615
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,518
Oh, my baby!

616
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:07,079
Oh, no!

617
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,719
Oh, no.

618
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,320
Oh, God!

619
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,960
Oh, God!

620
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,480
Hey, man, you just fucked up
your Ferrari.

621
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,320
- Oh, no!
Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

622
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,960
Neither is this!

623
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,159
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

624
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,360
I'm gonna hunt him down! That
motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

625
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,840
- Chem weapons. Isherwood.
- Marvin, look up Wolfburg
Federal Penitentiary.

626
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,840
The inmate is Mason, John.

627
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,760
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

628
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,239
I'm goin' over to Orkin to
design roach motels. Cool, huh?

629
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,239
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

630
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,679
I'm not really feeling too good
about it, okay? Wolfburg. Got it?

631
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,039
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

632
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,719
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

633
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,440
This is weird.
They got medical records.

634
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,559
They got place of birth. Glasgow.
Uh, but they don't have a name.

635
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:46,320
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
They have next of kin.

636
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,518
A Jade Angelou of
32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

637
00:48:09,518 --> 00:48:11,079
Jade?

638
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:14,719
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

639
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,000
Were you afraid
to come alone?

640
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:23,840
Yeah.

641
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,679
- It's okay.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

642
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,280
The last photograph I had
of you, you were about ten.

643
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,639
Yeah?

644
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,320
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things when she died.

645
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,719
Oh, yeah? Well, uh...
Why don't we take a walk?

646
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,559
I got 'im.
Palace of Fine Arts.

647
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,480
Your mother, uh... Yeah, well,
sh-she was very special.

648
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,960
Yeah, she was.

649
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,000
But I don't think that we
should romanticize what happened
between you and her.

650
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:01,840
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

651
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,559
Head out,
and I was the result.

652
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,440
Well, I'd like to think it
would've led somewhere if only...

653
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,559
If only what? Six federal marshals
hadn't kicked down our door...

654
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,960
and dragged you back
to prison?

655
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,760
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

656
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,199
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

657
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,199
That's good.

658
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:28,639
What did you do?

659
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,360
J...

660
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,599
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

661
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,320
But I'll be coming back.
And, uh...

662
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,880
- Maybe we can...
- What? We can what?

663
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,679
You know, you're almost
the only evidence...

664
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,119
that I exist.

665
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,000
But I don't know you.

666
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,079
That's what I want to change,
eh?

667
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,760
I've rehearsed this speech
a thousand times on the chance
that we would meet.

668
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,599
Here we are,
and I'm lost.

669
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,320
Well, I don't know how I'm
supposed to be feeling either.

670
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,360
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

671
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:18,480
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

672
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,880
Okay.

673
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,719
Is this about you?

674
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,239
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you?
Why did you come to me?

675
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,960
FBl, ma'am.
Your father's working with us.

676
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,960
He's helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

677
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,360
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

678
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,280
Well, gee whiz, John, I guess
we oughta get goin', huh?

679
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,760
Whatever you say, Stanley.

680
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,079
Thank you for that. You
could've handled it differently.

681
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,239
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

682
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,159
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

683
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,440
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

684
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,840
If I had my way, you would be
shipped back to Wolfburg
in leg irons...

685
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,239
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

686
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,280
You wrecked half the city!

687
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,639
Now, tell me about
the tunnels.

688
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,800
If you know the system, it will
take you wherever you need to go.

689
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,719
All right, there's an intake
pipe here, below low tide.
Is that our best access?

690
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,119
Yes. That's exactly where
I had come out.

691
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,518
Then beneath the cistern,
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

692
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,239
How many feet is that?

693
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,360
Uh, 57 paces.

694
00:51:59,518 --> 00:52:01,480
Where do we go from there?

695
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:07,320
Where do we go from there?

696
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,800
That's a good question.

697
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:14,400
- I have no idea.
- What?

698
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,639
I mean, I'll know it
when we're all inside.

699
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,039
No. You're not goddam goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

700
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,199
I can't! My blueprint
was in my head.

701
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,480
I was underground
for three days in the dark,

702
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:31,079
just waiting for the tides
to be right.

703
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:34,480
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

704
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:37,039
You're not going anywhere,
Mason.

705
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:42,159
Wait a second. Now, this piece
of work might be the only chance
those people over there have.

706
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,760
If he's not going, then why the
hell did we get him out of jail?

707
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,159
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

708
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,239
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

709
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,000
He'll fuck with you.

710
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:57,719
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

711
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,639
Now, Womack,

712
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,280
you're between The Rock
and a hard case.

713
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,360
How is your bowling arm?

714
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,719
Dr Goodspeed, the goal is
to take out the launchers,

715
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,199
then neutralize the
V.X. chemical rounds.

716
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,719
Well, we know the poison's being
kept in the prison morgue from
the satellite thermal imaging...

717
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,440
which is right here;
these colourized dots.

718
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:25,559
- Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?
- No, sir, but I've studied them.

719
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:28,960
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

720
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,599
Got a really neat layout
over here of the chem round
as well as the rocket,

721
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,440
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

722
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,320
Oh, it's very necessary,
sir.

723
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,599
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything
you can imagine.

724
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,280
An ecological disaster,
sir.

725
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,719
Plus the devices themselves
are complicated.

726
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,239
That's why you're
coming with us.

727
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,920
- I am?
- You're the expert.
What's your problem?

728
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,518
You mean I'm going, going
out there, under the water?

729
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:02,760
Well, earlier today
you wanted a gun.

730
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,000
Now you're getting a gun
and a wet suit.

731
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,639
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

732
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,159
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

733
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,599
An incursion underwater to
retake an impregnable fortress
held by an elite team...

734
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,719
of U.S. Marines
in possession of 81 hostages
and 15 guided rockets...

735
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,760
armed with
V.X. poisoned gas.

736
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,480
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

737
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,518
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

738
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,639
You don't look too good.

739
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,280
In fact,
you look like shit.

740
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,518
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

741
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,840
You all right?

742
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,960
I mean, you gonna make it
through this thing?

743
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,039
I don't know.

744
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,440
I always expected something
like this was going to happen,

745
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:55,239
but nothing prepares you
for it.

746
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,559
Now I'm...
I'm responsible...

747
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,518
for a whole city.

748
00:55:02,518 --> 00:55:04,119
Look, I know this
isn't easy for you.

749
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,360
Remember you were trained
for this kind of a situation...

750
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:08,400
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

751
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,760
Besides, you got the best
SEAL team in the country backing you up.

752
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,440
Okay.
You're right.

753
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,960
l-I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

754
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,760
There's something else.

755
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,239
It's terrible.
N-No, it's wonderful,

756
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,679
except it isn't.

757
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,920
My girlfriend's pregnant...

758
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:34,719
and she's just flown in
to see me.

759
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,440
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight.

760
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,119
And I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command centre.

761
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,360
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

762
00:55:56,518 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

763
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,840
Uh, Frank, uh,
we're havin' a few problems
with the account transfer.

764
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,280
- Don't tell me problems,
tell me solutions.
- Now, we've spoken to the president,

765
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,639
and I know that you're
well aware of his stance on terrorism.

766
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,760
- So what we'd like to do is...
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

767
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,360
It's about reminding you people
who found it politically
convenient to forget.

768
00:56:17,518 --> 00:56:19,679
This is goin' nowhere,
Frank.

769
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,440
Well, then, let me tell you
what is.

770
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,920
Fifteen V.X. gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

771
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,199
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

772
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,920
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

773
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,440
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us...

774
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,480
no definite assurance
on the thermite plasma.

775
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:41,559
That is the word.

776
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:47,960
Green light
to SEAL incursion.

777
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,679
Fall in!
All right, listen up.

778
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,800
Mr Mason will run point
for us.

779
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,800
Lieutenant Shepard will be
attached to his hip.

780
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,719
You breathe, he breathes
with you. You piss, he helps.

781
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,599
Understood?

782
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,000
Dr Goodspeed
is our specialist.

783
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:25,679
When he neutralizes the threat,
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

784
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,639
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight
of our lives...

785
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,559
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander in the Vietnam War.

786
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,760
I shit you not.

787
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,679
Any questions?

788
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:40,280
Let's load up!

789
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,440
After you, ace.

790
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,360
Pass out and activate
the minicams.

791
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,400
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?

792
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,840
Roger that, sir.
We are on-line.

793
00:58:26,518 --> 00:58:31,239
Shep, what's the status on the
special operational gear for Mr Mason?

794
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,280
Uh, let's see.
We have, uh,

795
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,039
one quart of kerosene
in a squeeze bottle.

796
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:46,599
Three washers
and waterproof matches.

797
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,880
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

798
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:52,239
Now, this is atropine. If you
come in contact with the gas,

799
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,440
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

800
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,719
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

801
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:04,119
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 275.

802
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,518
Range: 6,000 metres.

803
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,679
FBl Command Centre?

804
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,800
- Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.
- Nope.

805
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,960
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed
is my boyfriend.
Actually, he's, um, my fiance.

806
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,360
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

807
00:59:21,518 --> 00:59:24,320
Okay. Well, you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead,
then.

808
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,480
Hey, where are you g...
Goddam it!

809
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,800
Decoy choppers
commencing run to Alcatraz.

810
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,559
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

811
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:41,480
- We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.
- Shit!

812
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,159
In my day, we did it all with a
snorkel and a pair of flippers.

813
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,480
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

814
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,480
I don't...
I don't know anything about you.

815
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,920
- Hmm. I know something
about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

816
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:06,518
Goodspeed, Godspeed,
Godspell,

817
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:09,239
you never went to
any antiterrorist school.

818
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,079
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

819
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,960
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

820
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:21,679
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage,

821
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,599
heading around
Treasure Island.

822
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:28,559
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

823
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,079
Decoys?

824
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:38,000
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

825
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,760
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

826
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,039
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

827
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:53,480
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

828
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:57,159
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

829
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,880
All right, so the S.D.U.s
have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

830
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,599
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

831
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,760
- Double-time it.
- Yes, sir. Hendrix!

832
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,760
- You lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

833
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,800
Let's move. Move out!
Move out! Move out!

834
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:26,639
The Eagles are on The Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

835
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:34,800
Thank you very fucking much,
Mr Mason.

836
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,119
You've led us into a room
with no exit.

837
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,719
- Any ideas, Dillinger?
- Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

838
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,320
We're a little tight
on time.

839
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:48,559
You stand by the door
until I open it.

840
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,719
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that?

841
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:54,880
Through here.

842
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,199
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

843
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:06,119
I just hope
it hasn't been changed.

844
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,039
You catch one of those
flame bursts, you're a corpse.

845
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,239
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never
to leave his sight, but, uh...

846
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,280
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

847
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:17,119
Have a nice day.

848
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:42,239
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

849
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:52,039
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

850
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:55,719
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

851
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:58,000
Sweep forward!

852
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:09,119
Looks like he fucked us,
Commander.

853
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,199
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

854
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,280
Welcome to The Rock.

855
01:04:33,918 --> 01:04:36,159
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

856
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:39,840
That's the subway. That'll
drop you into the tunnels.

857
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Do it!

858
01:04:57,918 --> 01:05:01,159
Sir, the Eagles have breached
the tunnel system.

859
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:09,719
You enjoying this?

860
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:12,759
Well, it's certainly more
enjoyable than my average day.

861
01:05:12,918 --> 01:05:17,079
Reading philosophy, avoiding
gang rape in the washroom.

862
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:20,960
Though it's less of a problem
these days. Maybe I'm losing
my sex appeal.

863
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,400
We've got seismic activity in
one of the storm grates. North side.

864
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,159
Continue patrolling
the area.

865
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:33,039
Sweep forward!

866
01:05:34,438 --> 01:05:36,119
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

867
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,960
- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
- Stand fast.

868
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,719
Down, down, down.

869
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:51,280
West storm drain's clear.

870
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:59,039
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

871
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,239
The Eagles are now at the access
tunnel. They're right under
the shower room, sir.

872
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,759
Fibre optics.

873
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,759
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

874
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,360
Quiet.

875
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:54,599
Motion sensors.

876
01:06:54,759 --> 01:06:58,559
- Beams cutting across
the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

877
01:07:02,759 --> 01:07:06,480
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

878
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:09,278
Possibly a prism.

879
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:14,559
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam,

880
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,800
send the beam back to its source
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

881
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,438
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

882
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,599
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

883
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,920
Got it.
Good to go.

884
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:38,079
- Fuck, man! I knew this
would happen! Fuck!
- Move!

885
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:40,239
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

886
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,079
They're entering
into the shower room, sir.

887
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:59,039
They're securing the area.

888
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,759
Just sit tight.

889
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,079
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

890
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:17,279
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

891
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,359
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

892
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:25,639
It's a fucking trap.

893
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,359
This is General Hummel.

894
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,000
Drop your weapons.
Drop 'em!

895
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:33,958
Anderson here,
General Hummel.

896
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:36,519
Commander. Team leader.

897
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,479
Commander Anderson, if you have
any concern for the lives of your men,

898
01:08:39,639 --> 01:08:42,479
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

899
01:08:42,639 --> 01:08:44,359
This is not happening.

900
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:47,759
Sir, we know why
you're out here.

901
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,078
God knows
I agree with you.

902
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,279
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies,

903
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:58,239
foreign, sir,
and domestic.

904
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,720
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

905
01:09:01,878 --> 01:09:04,359
You know goddam well
I can't give that order.

906
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:06,119
We're dead.

907
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:09,560
Your unit is covered from
an elevated position, Commander.

908
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,239
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

909
01:09:13,519 --> 01:09:15,680
No one has to die here.

910
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,000
Men following the General, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

911
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,000
Have you forgotten that?

912
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,119
We all have shipmates
we remember.

913
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,439
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

914
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,439
- But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!
- You call it what you want!

915
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,319
You're down there, we're up
here. You walked into the wrong
goddam room, Commander!

916
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,319
- Stand fast!
- Goddam it, Commander, one last time.

917
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,479
You tell your men to safety
their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

918
01:09:40,639 --> 01:09:43,039
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

919
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,838
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

920
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,600
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

921
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:52,000
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time. You order your
men to safety their weapons...

922
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,159
Cease fire!

923
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,958
Don't go.

924
01:10:23,878 --> 01:10:25,639
Cease fire!

925
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,000
Cease fire!

926
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,158
Shit! Goddam it!

927
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:40,519
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

928
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:42,639
Don't. Don't go.

929
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,600
It's over.

930
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:42,960
Oh, God!

931
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:03,199
Later.

932
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:15,559
- We got some movement.
- Who?
- Two of 'em!

933
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,279
- Who is it?
- Eagles 11 and 12.

934
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:20,000
- l-lt's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

935
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:22,559
I've gotta get a team together
right now. We've gotta move
with the second option.

936
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,960
What, and invite
another massacre? No way.

937
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:29,600
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

938
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:31,720
Not for Mason,
it isn't.

939
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:46,639
Goodspeed,
I'm not gonna kill you.

940
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:51,759
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

941
01:12:51,918 --> 01:12:54,399
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

942
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:58,000
Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?

943
01:12:58,158 --> 01:12:59,720
It's for you.

944
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:03,359
- Sir?
- What's the status?

945
01:13:03,519 --> 01:13:06,119
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

946
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:08,158
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

947
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:12,399
That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

948
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:15,000
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

949
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:18,079
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

950
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:20,798
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

951
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,918
I didn't want this.

952
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:27,519
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

953
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,600
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

954
01:13:30,759 --> 01:13:33,119
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

955
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:36,319
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

956
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,840
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, Captain.

957
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,359
Sir?

958
01:14:02,759 --> 01:14:05,038
You made
a terrible mistake.

959
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,239
And more of our brothers
have died in vain.

960
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:11,319
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

961
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:17,119
I need to talk to you
right now, alone.

962
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:19,559
Now you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis.

963
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,720
And I'm tellin' you right now,
I need to know who the fuck
John Mason is right now, sir.

964
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:28,759
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

965
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:31,519
is head of the FBl,
some say the country.

966
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,359
It's no secret he kept
microfilm files on prominent
Americans and Europeans:

967
01:14:35,519 --> 01:14:38,878
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the Prime Minister.

968
01:14:39,038 --> 01:14:41,960
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

969
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:45,519
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

970
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,239
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

971
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:51,000
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

972
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:54,279
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

973
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:56,239
And we held him
without trial...

974
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,519
until he gave up the microfilm,
but he never did.

975
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:03,239
Well, I'm surprised Hoover
didn't use his daughter as leverage.

976
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:06,479
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

977
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:10,038
Today, well, it's
a different Bureau.

978
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:14,239
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

979
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,559
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

980
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,720
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. assassination.

981
01:15:22,878 --> 01:15:26,439
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

982
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:31,878
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

983
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:34,798
Mason! Mason!

984
01:15:36,918 --> 01:15:39,199
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

985
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:41,000
Yeah, like me.

986
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:43,639
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

987
01:15:43,798 --> 01:15:46,399
Okay. FBl!
Freeze, sucker!

988
01:15:48,439 --> 01:15:52,439
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

989
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,000
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

990
01:15:56,158 --> 01:15:58,759
Let's find out.

991
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:04,840
I could; you, no.

992
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,279
Besides,
your safety's on.

993
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:10,840
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

994
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:15,679
Not yet.

995
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,038
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

996
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,559
You're right, I don't use guns
and I don't kick down doors.

997
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,279
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

998
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:28,519
What it says is
Chemical Weapons Specialist.

999
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,399
That's right.
I got a lunatic up there, man,

1000
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:35,918
with 15 missiles armed
with some really funky stuff.

1001
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:40,639
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1002
01:16:40,798 --> 01:16:45,038
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1003
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,199
They've got my girlfriend in
the city with a baby on the way.

1004
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:52,239
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1005
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,279
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1006
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:05,000
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

1007
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:08,639
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1008
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:11,439
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddam island.
Check every access you can find.

1009
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,519
Sir.

1010
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:21,639
Even if you escape
from the island,

1011
01:17:21,759 --> 01:17:24,798
you can't escape
the rockets.

1012
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,399
So, where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

1013
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:35,239
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

1014
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,079
What about your daughter?
Mason?

1015
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:45,639
Rodents located.

1016
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:49,798
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1017
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,158
I don't think you do.

1018
01:18:02,759 --> 01:18:04,759
Move!

1019
01:18:28,359 --> 01:18:29,840
They're onto us.

1020
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,079
Burn 'em out.

1021
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:36,359
This mother's gonna
blow big.

1022
01:19:16,519 --> 01:19:19,680
I don't understand. How could
we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1023
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,199
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

1024
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,519
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1025
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,680
How do you like
your choices?

1026
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,759
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

1027
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,759
All right, come on.

1028
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,239
This is the oldest part
of Alcatraz.

1029
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:49,038
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

1030
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,960
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too,

1031
01:19:52,118 --> 01:19:55,239
maybe when this is all over, you and l
can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1032
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:59,239
But right now I just... I just...
I wanna find some rockets.

1033
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,279
Don't tempt me.
We are going to the morgue.

1034
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,680
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1035
01:20:31,838 --> 01:20:33,359
Your best?

1036
01:20:33,519 --> 01:20:37,159
Losers always whine
about their best.

1037
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:40,038
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1038
01:20:41,519 --> 01:20:43,279
Carla was
the prom queen.

1039
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:46,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

1040
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:51,239
Locaters have them approaching
the morgue, sir.

1041
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:53,720
Come on, come on.
You can do it, Doc.

1042
01:21:01,319 --> 01:21:03,399
You must never hesitate.

1043
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:27,559
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1044
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,479
Him, but not the rocket.

1045
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,720
Any other news,
Professor?

1046
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:37,000
Not the rocket!
Not the rocket.

1047
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,118
I got a little somethin'
for ya.

1048
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:10,640
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1049
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,199
Mason,

1050
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:18,680
the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

1051
01:22:18,838 --> 01:22:20,759
Put it over there.

1052
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:33,479
You've been around a lot
of corpses. Is that normal?

1053
01:22:35,038 --> 01:22:37,118
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1054
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:40,038
- Yeah, that happens.
- Well, I'm having kind of
a hard time concentrating.

1055
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:43,920
- Can you do something about it?
- Well, like what? Kill him again?

1056
01:22:44,078 --> 01:22:46,798
Listen, I'm just
a biochemist.

1057
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,798
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1058
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,920
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

1059
01:22:55,078 --> 01:22:57,559
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

1060
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,199
So what do you say you cut me
some friggin' slack?

1061
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,798
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

1062
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,519
Unfortunately,
incredibly unstable.

1063
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,599
Well, what exactly
does this stuff do?

1064
01:23:22,759 --> 01:23:25,640
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it
can take out the entire city of people.

1065
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:31,399
Really? And what happens
if you drop one?

1066
01:23:31,559 --> 01:23:34,759
Happily, it'll just wipe out
you and me.

1067
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,159
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1068
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:40,359
Stops the brain from
sending nerve messages down the
spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1069
01:23:40,519 --> 01:23:43,399
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

1070
01:23:43,559 --> 01:23:47,838
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1071
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,680
Do not move that!

1072
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,118
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe.

1073
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:58,319
You spasm so hard you break your
own back, spit your guts out.

1074
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:01,078
But that's after
your skin melts off.

1075
01:24:01,239 --> 01:24:03,439
My God.

1076
01:24:03,599 --> 01:24:06,559
Oh, I think we'd like God on our
side at the moment, don't you?

1077
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,880
So what I'm doing now
is removing the guidance system chips...

1078
01:24:12,038 --> 01:24:13,880
so the rocket will splash down
after 500 feet.

1079
01:24:14,038 --> 01:24:16,000
All right,
let me have that.

1080
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:20,000
You can let go of it. All right,
just back away. Just back away!

1081
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:23,078
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

1082
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,439
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird. Over.

1083
01:24:29,599 --> 01:24:32,359
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddam it!

1084
01:24:34,599 --> 01:24:37,920
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1085
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:40,199
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

1086
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:43,078
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

1087
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:45,399
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1088
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,759
Hold it.

1089
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,319
Converge on the morgue.
Move out.

1090
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,078
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1091
01:24:57,239 --> 01:25:00,319
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

1092
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:02,038
Come on. Time's up.

1093
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:04,159
There's three rockets somewhere
else. We have to find them.

1094
01:25:07,559 --> 01:25:09,118
Come on!

1095
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,798
Clear!

1096
01:25:31,038 --> 01:25:32,759
I'm too old for this.

1097
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,399
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

1098
01:25:36,559 --> 01:25:39,720
Sir, all the guidance chips
are gone.

1099
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,838
Captain, I guess you didn't
quite take care of the rat problem.

1100
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,880
- No, sir.
- Well, there are two dead men here...

1101
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:47,319
- who strongly suggest
you go finish the job.
- Yes, sir.

1102
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:50,319
Yes, sir!
Rio, Royce, let's go!

1103
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,359
Move out!

1104
01:25:57,159 --> 01:26:00,239
- You really don't know
where this goes?
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1105
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:02,479
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1106
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,519
No, I don't.

1107
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:33,599
God.

1108
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:44,038
Mason, you all right?

1109
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,759
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot!

1110
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:51,439
- They're coming.
- Who?

1111
01:26:51,599 --> 01:26:54,279
- The Marines!
- Where?

1112
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:42,960
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1113
01:27:48,759 --> 01:27:51,559
No! No! No!

1114
01:28:05,559 --> 01:28:07,479
Mason!

1115
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:12,239
Mason!

1116
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,159
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1117
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,680
How do you do it?

1118
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:58,359
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1119
01:30:00,559 --> 01:30:02,279
Come on.

1120
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:06,519
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1121
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,960
Okay.

1122
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,880
Okay, the president arrives
in three hours.

1123
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:19,880
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1124
01:30:20,038 --> 01:30:23,118
- What's the word
from Mohave, General?
- The same as last time, Lou.

1125
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:25,838
They're going as fast
as they can.

1126
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:34,319
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

1127
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:47,038
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've
got something that belongs to me.

1128
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,479
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

1129
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:54,038
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

1130
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,038
Speak up.

1131
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:59,960
- Speak up!
- l, uh, uh...

1132
01:31:00,118 --> 01:31:02,759
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

1133
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,798
- Oh, man.
- And I'm a father of three.

1134
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,078
And, uh, they've got a gun
to my head.

1135
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:13,798
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips
to the exercise yard...

1136
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,519
- or Mr Henderson won't have a head.
- Oh, no.

1137
01:31:17,759 --> 01:31:20,159
Hey. Wha...

1138
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:22,439
Now, three to go.

1139
01:31:22,599 --> 01:31:25,479
You find them
and defuse them, okay?

1140
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,159
- All right.
- All right.

1141
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:31,720
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1142
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,880
Hey, what about
Mr Henderson's head?

1143
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:40,199
Okay?
What do you mean?

1144
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,559
Okay.

1145
01:31:59,078 --> 01:32:02,399
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1146
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:06,439
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

1147
01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:21,479
Bingo.

1148
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:32,199
Stand easy.

1149
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,599
Thought I'd been in the service
a long time.

1150
01:32:38,759 --> 01:32:42,798
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's Army, actually.

1151
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:48,078
Answer the question. And
address him as "General, sir."

1152
01:32:48,199 --> 01:32:51,118
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir,

1153
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:54,960
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.
Retired, of course.

1154
01:32:58,798 --> 01:33:02,159
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

1155
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:03,798
How the hell are you
involved in this?

1156
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,239
Oh, I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1157
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:09,559
I was, uh,
formerly a guest here.

1158
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:25,399
Hi, sweetie.

1159
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:34,319
Hey, come back here,
little boy.

1160
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,359
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this?

1161
01:33:38,519 --> 01:33:40,838
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1162
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,640
All I know is you were big
in Vietnam. I saw the highlights
on television.

1163
01:33:44,798 --> 01:33:47,759
Then you wouldn't have any
fuckin' idea what it means to
lead some of the finest men...

1164
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,078
on God's earth into battle, and
then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government.

1165
01:33:51,239 --> 01:33:54,239
I don't quite see how you cherish
the memory of the dead...

1166
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:56,960
by killing
another million.

1167
01:33:57,118 --> 01:34:00,038
And, uh,
this is not combat.

1168
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:04,239
It's an act of lunacy,
General, sir.

1169
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:06,960
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1170
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,038
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

1171
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:18,559
with the blood of patriots
and tyrants." Thomas Jefferson.

1172
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:23,399
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1173
01:34:28,838 --> 01:34:32,680
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

1174
01:34:32,838 --> 01:34:35,399
Where are
the guidance chips?

1175
01:34:35,559 --> 01:34:39,439
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

1176
01:34:39,599 --> 01:34:41,479
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

1177
01:35:09,399 --> 01:35:11,798
You're lucky that old man Hummel
wants you alive.

1178
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,798
'Cause I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

1179
01:35:20,359 --> 01:35:24,118
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you

1180
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,680
Boy

1181
01:35:25,838 --> 01:35:29,078
"I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy."

1182
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,838
What is wrong with
these people, huh, Mason?

1183
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,479
Don't you think there's
a lot of, uh, a lot of anger
floatin' around this island?

1184
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,640
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

1185
01:35:39,798 --> 01:35:43,559
A lot of angst, a lot of, "I'm 16,
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1186
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,838
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

1187
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,038
with a bunch of
violence-for-pleasure-seeking
psychopathic Marines.

1188
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,680
Shame on them!

1189
01:35:54,038 --> 01:35:57,439
Anyway, I only got one
chem round. There's two left.

1190
01:35:57,599 --> 01:36:01,279
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

1191
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:03,798
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

1192
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,159
when the inmates weren't allowed
to talk in here.

1193
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:08,880
Not allowed to talk.

1194
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
How'd you do it?

1195
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:16,479
Uh, nurtured the hope
that there was hope.

1196
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,078
That one day I'd breathe
free air.

1197
01:36:19,238 --> 01:36:22,399
Perhaps meet
my daughter.

1198
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:27,158
Modest hopes, but, uh,
they kept a man alive.

1199
01:36:27,319 --> 01:36:30,279
What'd they put you
away for, John?

1200
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:33,238
Oh, that's a long story.

1201
01:36:33,399 --> 01:36:36,118
Well, I'm not goin'
anywhere.

1202
01:36:36,279 --> 01:36:39,158
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1203
01:36:39,319 --> 01:36:40,840
Seven hours.

1204
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:45,479
Thermite plasma
is operational.

1205
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:48,679
- Get me the president.
- Be seated.

1206
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,719
Gentlemen, consider yourselves
on ground alert. If we receive
launch authority,

1207
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,359
your mission is
the complete thermal destruction
of Alcatraz Island.

1208
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,760
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1209
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,559
Eighty-one American civilians
and a number of U.S. Marines...

1210
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,880
will lose their lives
in this air strike.

1211
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,158
Why didn't you just tell them
where the microfilm was...

1212
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:12,000
and, and create a solution?

1213
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:16,519
Hmph. The moment they had the
microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1214
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:20,439
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

1215
01:37:20,599 --> 01:37:24,599
Which brings me to another
question. When you broke out...

1216
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,038
Let me see if I can get this straight.
You went down the incinerator chute,

1217
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:33,359
on the mine cars, through
the tunnels to the power plant,

1218
01:37:33,519 --> 01:37:37,158
under the steam engine... That
was really cool, by the way.

1219
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:39,719
And into the cistern
through the intake pipe.

1220
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:45,078
But how, in the name
of Zeus's butthole,

1221
01:37:45,238 --> 01:37:47,880
did you get out
of your cell?

1222
01:37:48,038 --> 01:37:50,599
I only ask because
in our current situation,

1223
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:55,719
well, it could prove
to be useful information, maybe!

1224
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:16,198
Trade secrets, my son.

1225
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:18,519
Wow.

1226
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,000
General, two
operational rockets left.

1227
01:38:21,158 --> 01:38:22,760
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

1228
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,760
And both of the birds
are ready to fly, sir.

1229
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,000
- G-General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.

1230
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:31,559
Oh, just makin' sure.

1231
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:36,038
Should we prepare
for launch, General?

1232
01:38:36,198 --> 01:38:38,118
I'll handle the strategy,
Captain.

1233
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:41,639
Yes, sir.

1234
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,479
The hour is approaching, sir.
Just letting the General know
of the time, sir.

1235
01:38:45,639 --> 01:38:49,279
- I'm very aware of the time, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1236
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:51,920
Me and my boys are ready to
cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1237
01:38:54,359 --> 01:38:56,118
Mason, where're you going?

1238
01:38:56,279 --> 01:38:58,639
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1239
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,920
You're not leaving! There's a madman in
there with his hand on a, on a button!

1240
01:39:04,078 --> 01:39:07,078
Shh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

1241
01:39:08,279 --> 01:39:11,118
Stop moving, Mason.

1242
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,639
Mason, stop moving.

1243
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,238
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1244
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:20,719
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

1245
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,038
Oh, well, then,
everything's just fine!

1246
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:25,559
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1247
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Three minutes to go,
sir.

1248
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:33,118
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

1249
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:36,118
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

1250
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:39,118
Sir.

1251
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,399
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.

1252
01:39:46,559 --> 01:39:49,038
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's goin'?

1253
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:52,158
- Listen, on this end we're gonna
need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.

1254
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:55,078
Listen, uh, Frank, we have
to get final authorization
from the president.

1255
01:39:55,238 --> 01:39:57,198
You've got three minutes.

1256
01:39:57,359 --> 01:39:59,479
Frank, please don't do
anything stupid.

1257
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,880
They want another hour.

1258
01:40:04,038 --> 01:40:07,158
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1259
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:09,238
They're calling
our bluff, sir.

1260
01:40:09,399 --> 01:40:13,038
They're playing you
for a fool, sir.

1261
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:16,238
Order the launch,
General.

1262
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:19,760
Come on, General.
Let's be all we can be.

1263
01:40:33,599 --> 01:40:35,559
The mission's not complete!

1264
01:40:35,719 --> 01:40:37,479
Well, mine is.

1265
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:40,238
When this is over,
you'll go back home,

1266
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:45,158
driving Carla and your baby
insane in your beige Volvo.

1267
01:40:45,319 --> 01:40:48,719
And I'll be dead or back in
prison, which is the same thing.

1268
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,840
You're not leaving.

1269
01:40:55,158 --> 01:40:59,000
All right,
I'll do it myself.

1270
01:41:00,519 --> 01:41:02,479
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

1271
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:06,319
I'll kick the... Out of
a platoon full of Marines.

1272
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:09,078
No problem.

1273
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:23,198
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

1274
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:26,639
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1275
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:29,000
Let's go!

1276
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:36,279
Laser powered up!

1277
01:41:36,439 --> 01:41:41,399
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

1278
01:41:41,559 --> 01:41:45,960
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. I'm a
chemical weapons specialist for the FBl.

1279
01:41:46,118 --> 01:41:47,920
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1280
01:41:48,078 --> 01:41:50,519
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

1281
01:41:50,679 --> 01:41:53,238
Because if the winds change
after you launch those rockets,

1282
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:55,238
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

1283
01:41:55,399 --> 01:41:59,198
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1284
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:02,479
So, what do you say you do
the math, h-hand over the gun...

1285
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,840
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck...

1286
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:16,880
- You made the right choice.
- I decided I didn't want your child...

1287
01:42:17,038 --> 01:42:19,679
growing up
without a father.

1288
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,519
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

1289
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:25,519
So, I'm fucked either way.
So, come on.

1290
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,399
Weapon is hot. I am standing by
for the launch command.

1291
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:31,118
Man, killing Navy SEALs
is one thing...

1292
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:34,479
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

1293
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:39,479
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1294
01:42:39,639 --> 01:42:42,399
Launch coordinates:
six, seven,

1295
01:42:42,559 --> 01:42:45,519
five, four, five,
niner.

1296
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:51,840
The weapon is hot. I'm
standing by for launch command.

1297
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,840
That's affirmative.

1298
01:43:00,359 --> 01:43:02,639
Standing by for command.

1299
01:43:10,359 --> 01:43:12,760
I'm waiting for
launch command, General.

1300
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:23,319
- Fire.
- Fire!

1301
01:43:28,198 --> 01:43:30,319
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1302
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:40,000
Origin: Alcatraz,
67253725.

1303
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:43,960
- What's the goddam heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1304
01:43:44,118 --> 01:43:48,158
- Speed?
- Three hundred knots.
It's headed right at Oakland.

1305
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:50,599
Football game.

1306
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,599
Oh, my God.

1307
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:19,559
Missile radically
changing direction.

1308
01:44:24,519 --> 01:44:28,679
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1309
01:44:30,118 --> 01:44:32,238
Oh, Christ!

1310
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:34,639
Missile losing altitude.
Falling.

1311
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:39,439
Falling, 300 feet,
200, 100.

1312
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:45,319
Bogey detonated
under water.

1313
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:49,519
- What the fuck?
- It missed.

1314
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:54,158
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

1315
01:44:54,279 --> 01:44:56,399
But there's still
one left.

1316
01:44:56,559 --> 01:45:00,000
What happened to the rocket?
What the fuck happened
to the coordinates?

1317
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:03,479
What the fuck is going on?
Sir! Major!

1318
01:45:03,639 --> 01:45:06,439
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

1319
01:45:06,599 --> 01:45:08,399
Captain, step outside!

1320
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:23,479
Get me the Pentagon.

1321
01:45:37,038 --> 01:45:39,760
What the hell was that,
Frank?

1322
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,880
- I said, what the hell...
- I heard what you said! If
you're gonna be insubordinate,

1323
01:45:43,038 --> 01:45:46,359
- I'd appreciate it if you'd do
it with a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1324
01:45:46,519 --> 01:45:48,279
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill
these people.

1325
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:50,319
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

1326
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:53,359
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1327
01:45:53,519 --> 01:45:56,439
You're coming loose. The rest
of us are in complete control.

1328
01:45:56,599 --> 01:45:59,359
- We're askin' 'em. We're askin'
'em for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1329
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:01,238
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are Marines!

1330
01:46:01,399 --> 01:46:04,800
Are they?

1331
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,439
- I wanna talk to General Kramer.
- You've been asked by an old friend.

1332
01:46:07,599 --> 01:46:09,960
- Put him on the phone right now.
- You've been ordered
by a superior officer.

1333
01:46:10,118 --> 01:46:12,880
- This is Major Baxter.
- Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

1334
01:46:13,038 --> 01:46:15,319
Put the phone down.

1335
01:46:19,038 --> 01:46:21,599
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

1336
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:24,880
At ease.

1337
01:46:33,158 --> 01:46:35,599
They need a decision,
Mr President.

1338
01:46:44,359 --> 01:46:46,719
These past few hours...

1339
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:50,479
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

1340
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,519
How does one weigh
human life?

1341
01:46:54,679 --> 01:46:57,920
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

1342
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:01,198
And in the middle,
Frank Hummel.

1343
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:07,279
That we have ignored,
abandoned or marginalized...

1344
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:09,679
a great soldier
like Frank Hummel,

1345
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:14,479
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect in blood...

1346
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,639
is equally real
and equally tragic.

1347
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:24,359
We are at war
with terror.

1348
01:47:24,519 --> 01:47:26,639
Fighting a war
means casualties.

1349
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,000
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1350
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:36,479
Air strike approved.

1351
01:47:39,559 --> 01:47:41,198
Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.

1352
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,279
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there,

1353
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:48,279
- Tower this is Strike Leader.
Prepared to go.
- it'll be over in a few seconds.

1354
01:47:48,439 --> 01:47:50,279
Flight time to drop point:
17 minutes.

1355
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:01,439
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you,
but what the fuck is going on?

1356
01:48:01,599 --> 01:48:04,599
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?
- That's affirmative, Captain.

1357
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:08,519
So, now they think we're
gutless, the Feds? They think
we won't actually do it.

1358
01:48:08,679 --> 01:48:11,399
They're gonna come at us
with everything they've got.
Air and sea.

1359
01:48:11,559 --> 01:48:15,479
- They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.
- They don't know we missed on purpose.

1360
01:48:15,639 --> 01:48:21,038
Great. We're not gutless,
we're incompetent. That right?

1361
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:24,840
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1362
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,359
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1363
01:48:27,519 --> 01:48:29,319
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

1364
01:48:29,479 --> 01:48:32,760
Excuse me, General, but what
about the fucking money?

1365
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,238
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1366
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:37,000
Bullshit it's over.

1367
01:48:37,158 --> 01:48:40,519
You're talking to a General,
soldier. Maintain discipline.

1368
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:42,599
I'm not a soldier, Major.

1369
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:47,198
The day we took hostages we became
mercenaries. And mercenaries get paid!

1370
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:49,800
I want my fucking money!

1371
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,479
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1372
01:48:53,639 --> 01:48:57,439
I'm not about to kill 80,000
innocent people. Do you think
I'm out of my fucking mind?

1373
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:02,279
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1374
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:09,038
Whoever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1375
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:10,960
Stand down, Captain.

1376
01:49:15,479 --> 01:49:17,599
Stand down, Captain!

1377
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:26,118
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1378
01:49:29,038 --> 01:49:32,920
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

1379
01:49:33,078 --> 01:49:35,359
Sergeant Crisp,

1380
01:49:35,519 --> 01:49:38,118
secure the General.

1381
01:49:38,279 --> 01:49:40,479
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1382
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,760
Sergeant!

1383
01:49:53,519 --> 01:49:56,679
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1384
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,880
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

1385
01:50:13,399 --> 01:50:16,279
It has been the greatest honour
of my life to serve with you, General.

1386
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:23,800
But like he said,

1387
01:50:25,158 --> 01:50:27,599
it's over.

1388
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,960
Let's get him.

1389
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:52,359
Mason!

1390
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:58,679
- My God, what have I done?
- Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

1391
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:04,439
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1392
01:51:04,599 --> 01:51:07,158
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

1393
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:22,599
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

1394
01:51:28,679 --> 01:51:32,679
One, two, three!
Eat that!

1395
01:51:46,559 --> 01:51:47,880
Did it.

1396
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,960
Come here. Come here,
you little chicken shit!

1397
01:52:22,118 --> 01:52:25,198
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1398
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:27,439
Well, come on. Come on. Don't
be scared. I won't hurt ya.

1399
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:29,639
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

1400
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:31,800
You know how
this shit works?

1401
01:52:35,719 --> 01:52:37,639
Come on. Come on.

1402
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,719
I don't need the gun.
I'll put it down.

1403
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:44,000
Come on, let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1404
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:48,559
Listen, I think we got
started off on the wrong foot.
Stan Goodspeed, FBl. Uh...

1405
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,719
Let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1406
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,800
I don't like
soft-ass shit.

1407
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:55,960
Oh, you... Oh, oh.
Oh.

1408
01:52:56,118 --> 01:52:59,880
Well, I only bring it up
because, uh, it's you.

1409
01:53:00,038 --> 01:53:02,399
You're the Rocket Man.

1410
01:53:04,038 --> 01:53:05,679
No!

1411
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:11,719
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

1412
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:17,359
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1413
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,960
Shit!

1414
01:53:40,198 --> 01:53:42,198
Darrow!

1415
01:53:42,359 --> 01:53:44,238
Open up!

1416
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,519
Come on.

1417
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:50,279
Open up!

1418
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,519
Hey, you mother!

1419
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:55,158
Oh, I'm gonna get you now,
baby.

1420
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:01,078
Okay.

1421
01:55:03,158 --> 01:55:04,679
I got ya.
I got you, baby.

1422
01:55:06,078 --> 01:55:08,158
Come on.

1423
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:24,880
Fucker!

1424
01:55:50,519 --> 01:55:52,399
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

1425
01:55:52,559 --> 01:55:54,760
Time on target:
seven minutes.

1426
01:56:11,399 --> 01:56:14,158
English prick. I tell you
my old man was Irish?

1427
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,559
Maintain air speed
450 knots.

1428
01:56:25,639 --> 01:56:27,599
Fuck!

1429
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:47,198
It's me and you, pal.

1430
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:49,639
I want that fucking chip!

1431
01:56:59,519 --> 01:57:01,439
I love pressure.

1432
01:57:08,439 --> 01:57:11,238
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1433
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:13,639
Now, pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1434
01:57:42,038 --> 01:57:44,279
Increase speed
to 500 knots.

1435
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:47,000
You motherfucker!
Die!

1436
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:55,359
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

1437
01:57:55,519 --> 01:57:58,198
Eat that, you fuck!

1438
01:58:23,158 --> 01:58:25,479
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1439
01:58:30,359 --> 01:58:34,158
Come to course heading
142 degrees.

1440
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:43,599
When he neutralizes
the threat,

1441
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:46,679
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1442
01:58:51,279 --> 01:58:54,760
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1443
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,880
Please don't let this happen. There has
to be something you can do. Please.

1444
01:59:08,198 --> 01:59:11,038
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

1445
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,038
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1446
01:59:26,359 --> 01:59:30,078
This is Red Thunder.
Master armed. Master armed.

1447
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:33,760
Time on target:
12 seconds.

1448
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:39,158
T.O.T.:
ten seconds.

1449
01:59:43,158 --> 01:59:44,920
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1450
01:59:47,479 --> 01:59:49,479
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1451
01:59:49,639 --> 01:59:52,760
This is C.Q. One, C.Q. One! Green smoke!
We have green smoke! Over.

1452
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,960
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

1453
01:59:55,118 --> 01:59:57,679
- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
- Jesus Chri...

1454
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,359
I already dropped them!

1455
02:00:11,078 --> 02:00:14,840
- Oh, goddam it!
- Oh, my God!

1456
02:00:17,519 --> 02:00:20,319
Get out of my way. Let me
through, please. Let me through!

1457
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:28,319
The cells did not get hit.
The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1458
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:55,158
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1459
02:00:55,319 --> 02:00:59,118
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1460
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:04,319
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.
Spend all my money on shrinks.

1461
02:01:05,519 --> 02:01:07,359
Goodspeed, come in.

1462
02:01:07,519 --> 02:01:10,519
Goodspeed, Goodspeed,
do you read me? Come in!

1463
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:13,960
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1464
02:01:16,118 --> 02:01:18,719
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1465
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:27,279
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1466
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:30,000
This is Goodspeed.

1467
02:01:31,639 --> 02:01:35,760
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of 'em.

1468
02:01:38,679 --> 02:01:41,118
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

1469
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:43,840
What about Mason?

1470
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,960
- He's dead, sir.
- How? When?

1471
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:55,599
Just come and get me.

1472
02:01:58,038 --> 02:02:01,038
Womack tore up your pardon,
John.

1473
02:02:01,198 --> 02:02:03,760
But, of course.
I knew he would.

1474
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,840
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1475
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,479
If you can get to the Pan
Pacific Hotel, there's clothes
in my closet, $200 in the Bible.

1476
02:02:11,639 --> 02:02:14,038
Room 26.

1477
02:02:14,198 --> 02:02:18,359
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1478
02:02:20,279 --> 02:02:23,319
But thank you.

1479
02:02:23,479 --> 02:02:29,038
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when we go
our separate ways, huh?

1480
02:02:29,198 --> 02:02:33,479
But, uh, I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name "Goodspeed."

1481
02:02:33,639 --> 02:02:37,559
Yeah, Godspeed: to wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1482
02:02:37,719 --> 02:02:41,238
Well, if you fancy
a journey,

1483
02:02:41,399 --> 02:02:44,158
I recommend
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1484
02:02:45,158 --> 02:02:47,238
I was thinking of Maui.

1485
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:49,479
No.

1486
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,760
Forget Maui.

1487
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,920
St Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1488
02:03:05,078 --> 02:03:07,198
Front pew, right leg.

1489
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:10,038
Hollow.

1490
02:03:10,198 --> 02:03:12,760
Is this what I think it is?

1491
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:17,118
Mason?

1492
02:03:30,038 --> 02:03:33,038
- Congratulations, Dr Goodspeed.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.

1493
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:35,840
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1494
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,198
Well done, son.

1495
02:03:38,359 --> 02:03:39,880
So, where's Mason?

1496
02:03:40,038 --> 02:03:43,920
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1497
02:03:44,078 --> 02:03:46,238
Blown out to sea, huh?

1498
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:48,679
Yeah.

1499
02:03:49,559 --> 02:03:53,599
Poor bastard.

1500
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:58,479
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his
body? I wanna see that son of a bitch!

1501
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:02,038
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1502
02:04:02,198 --> 02:04:06,559
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1503
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:09,679
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely, sir.

1504
02:04:12,439 --> 02:04:16,319
St Michael's Church,
front pew, right leg.

1505
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:18,238
Front pew, right leg.

1506
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:20,279
Vandals! Vandals!

1507
02:04:20,439 --> 02:04:22,519
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1508
02:04:22,679 --> 02:04:26,279
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

1509
02:04:26,439 --> 02:04:29,118
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

1510
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:32,359
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

1511
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:35,559
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1512
02:04:37,559 --> 02:04:40,279
Vandals! Vandals!

1513
02:04:40,439 --> 02:04:45,198
Honey, uh, you wanna know
who really killed J.F.K.?

1514
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,052
