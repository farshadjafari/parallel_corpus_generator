1
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,194
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, mate.

2
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,820
Don't worry about it.

3
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,489
You all right?

4
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,742
Enjoy L.A.

5
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,979
- He did it.
- It's all right.

6
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,852
Can you tell me why
everything is always about you?

7
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,395
Everything is not always about me.

8
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,564
That gearhead with his
pocket protector was being sarcastic,

9
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,316
- and you damn well know it.
- "Sarcastic". You know what?

10
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,610
- I'm sorry, I just didn't see it that way.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

11
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,778
What about the dig about
the makeover? That was really nice.

12
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,281
What do you want me to do?
I work with the man, for Christ's sake.

13
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,659
And you know what? You're perfectly
capable of taking care of your own shit.

14
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,787
You know something? The last time
I checked, you were sleeping with me.

15
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,416
So unless you want to start
fucking him, I suggest...

16
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,058
Pal, where can I catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?

17
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,269
- Back there.
- Thanks.

18
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,117
It was him in that gold Lexus
on the cell phone.

19
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,039
Are they still asking
for a change of venue?

20
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,751
He's enhanceable
because of priors in the early '80s.

21
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,966
- Where to?
- Downtown. 312 North Spring Street.

22
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,551
Downtown.

23
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,809
Look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7 a.m., period, okay?

24
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,855
Hold on.
Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea.

25
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,108
Take La Brea north to Sixth
into downtown.

26
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,861
So what? You'll be up late.

27
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,071
I'm pulling an all-nighter, too,
so save the tears.

28
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,490
I'll take the 105 east to the 110.
That's faster.

29
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,700
What?

30
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,494
I said, the 105 to the 110,
that'll get you there quicker.

31
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,080
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

32
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,251
But once you get to La Brea north
of Santa Monica, then it's jammed.

33
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,627
The 110 north of the 10,

34
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,756
you get people driving to Pasadena,
and they drive slow.

35
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,218
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand, and then I...

36
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,432
Hey, surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.

37
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,772
- Are we taking bets?
- Are we?

38
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,482
But what if you're wrong?

39
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,861
I don't think I'm gonna be wrong,
but if I am, the ride's free.

40
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,159
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

41
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,976
Go ahead, say it.

42
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,603
- Say what?
- Go ahead.

43
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,522
Oh, I got lucky with the lights.

44
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,774
You weren't lucky with the lights.
What you were was right.

45
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,567
I was wrong.

46
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,571
Max.

47
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,040
You mind turning that up?

48
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,503
- You like the classics.
- I do. I used to play in high school.

49
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,005
- Let me guess. Woodwinds.
- No. Strings.

50
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,924
I never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

51
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,344
Could've fooled me by the way
you were unloading on that cell phone.

52
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,346
Different instrument.

53
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,266
You know,
if you had just listened to me,

54
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,435
we'd be all bogged down in traffic
right now.

55
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,520
You would've made yourself
an extra 5 bucks.

56
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,191
Yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks.
Buy you something special. Go wild.

57
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:27,529
Really, it's not that... It's not a big deal.
Nothing big here.

58
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,197
Well, how many cabbies do you know

59
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,199
get you into an argument
to save you money?

60
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,201
There were two of us.
I had to kill the other one.

61
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,203
I don't like competition.

62
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,751
Take pride in being good
at what you do?

63
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,797
What, this? Oh, this is...
This is... No, this is part-time.

64
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,467
This is a fill-in job. Pay the bills.

65
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,637
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

66
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,894
- What else?
- Just shaping up some things.

67
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,021
Like?

68
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,982
Tell me.

69
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,902
Limo company I'm putting together.
Island Limos.

70
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,655
It's gonna be like an island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

71
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,075
When you get to the airport, you're
not gonna wanna get out of my limo.

72
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,245
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases,

73
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,500
staff up, get the right client list.
You know, things like that.

74
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,545
How do you like being a lawyer?

75
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,758
- What are you, psychic?
- Little bit.

76
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,760
There's the dark pinstripe suit.

77
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,012
Elegant, not too flashy.
That rules out advertising.

78
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,098
Plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.

79
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,769
And the purse. A Bottega.

80
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:45,273
Anyway, a man gets in my cab
with a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

81
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,861
You? Clarence Darrow.

82
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,865
Well, no, not quite.
He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor.

83
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,909
- Big case?
- Yeah.

84
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,538
- Got us here fast.
- Of course.

85
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,291
But you didn't answer my question.

86
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,168
Do you like what you do?

87
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,171
Yeah.

88
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,718
But not today.

89
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,014
No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

90
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,601
I love standing in that courtroom.

91
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,186
At the same time, I get this

92
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,690
clenched-up thing
the night before the first days.

93
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,401
Clenched up? How?

94
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,876
I think I'm gonna lose.
I think the case sucks,

95
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,337
my exhibits aren't in order,
I'm not prepared enough,

96
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,464
people are gonna find out
that I don't know what I'm doing

97
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,383
and I've been running some charade
all these years.

98
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,510
I represent the Department of Justice,

99
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,764
and my opening statement is gonna
fall flat at the most important point,

100
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,391
and the jury's gonna laugh at me.

101
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,731
And then I cry. I don't throw up.

102
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,610
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

103
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,906
And then I pull myself together,
I rewrite my opening statement,

104
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,826
work my exhibits, and that's what I do
for the rest of the night.

105
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,745
That's my routine.

106
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,918
In the morning, it starts, and I'm fine.

107
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,921
You need a vacation.

108
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,964
I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

109
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,051
No, no, not in a cab. I mean,
you need to get your head straight.

110
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,638
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic. You know...

111
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,181
When was the last time
you took a break?

112
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,766
I go on a vacation all the time.

113
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,310
- How often?
- A dozen times a day.

114
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,270
My favorite spot.

115
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,315
Maldives Island.

116
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,820
It's my own private getaway.

117
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,698
Things get heavy for me,
I take five minutes out,

118
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,117
and I just go there.

119
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,286
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

120
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,796
- Here. Take it.
- Oh, no. I couldn't do that.

121
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,841
Take it. Take it, because you need it
a lot more than I do.

122
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,510
And it'll help you. I guarantee it.

123
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,151
Thanks, Max.

124
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,570
Go get 'em.

125
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,350
Hey.

126
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,859
I don't know,

127
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:03,281
in case you ever wanna investigate
a Fortune 500 company or

128
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,202
argue cab routes.

129
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,644
Hey.

130
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,443
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hey, yeah. Come on, man, I'm sorry.

131
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,780
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.
I'll take you.

132
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,205
- Where to?
- 1039 South Union Street.

133
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,374
Gotcha.

134
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,851
- How long you think this'll take?
- Seven minutes.

135
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,896
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

136
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,648
Two minutes to get across the 110
to Normandie.

137
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,233
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

138
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,861
Over to Union is one.
Plus one for "shit happens".

139
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,905
- Okay if I time you?
- Knock yourself out.

140
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,740
What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

141
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,618
You get an apology.
I already offered my free ride today.

142
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,703
- To who?
- Some girl.

143
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,248
Did you get a date with her?

144
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,960
- First time in L.A.?
- No.

145
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,298
Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here,
I can't wait to leave.

146
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,842
Too sprawled out, disconnected.
You know.

147
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,887
- That's me. You like it?
- It's my home.

148
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,805
Seventeen million people.
This was a country,

149
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,726
it'd be the fifth biggest economy in the
world, and nobody knows each other.

150
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,271
I read about this guy,
gets on the MTA here, dies.

151
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,149
Six hours he's riding the subway

152
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,194
before anybody notices his corpse
doing laps around L.A.,

153
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,030
people on and off sitting next to him.

154
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,698
Nobody notices.

155
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,623
This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

156
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,251
- Regular ride?
- Yeah, I share it with the day-shift guy.

157
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,213
- Because you prefer nights?
- Yeah, people are more relaxed.

158
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,674
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

159
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,761
- How are the benefits?
- Oh, no. It's not that kind ofjob.

160
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,514
I'm not in this for the long haul.
I'm just filling in, you know.

161
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,975
Just temporary while I'm getting
some things shaped up.

162
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,434
This is just temporary.

163
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,145
- How long you been driving?
- Twelve years.

164
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,730
Really?

165
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,234
What other things you putting together?

166
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,535
You know, I don't wanna talk about it.
Just a little business plan.

167
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,788
- No offense. I just...
- None taken.

168
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,542
You're one of these guys that do
instead of talk.

169
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,127
That's cool.

170
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,763
- Seven minutes. Man, you're good.
- I got lucky with the lights.

171
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,600
Yeah, sure. You probably know
the light schedules, too.

172
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,022
Listen, I'm in town on a real-estate deal,
close in one night.

173
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,358
I got five stops to make.
Collect signatures, see some friends,

174
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,070
and then I got a 6:00 a.m. out of LAX.
Why don't you hang with me?

175
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,281
The car's not for hire, man.
That's against regs.

176
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,616
- Regulations?
- Yeah.

177
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,454
These guys don't pay you sick leave.
How much you pull down a shift?

178
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,330
- How much?
- 350, 400.

179
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,043
Yeah? Well, let me tell you what.
I'll make it 600.

180
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,213
- Man, I don't know.
- Plus an extra hundred

181
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,382
you get me to LAX
and I don't have to run for the plane.

182
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,134
Oh, no, guy. I don't know about this.

183
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,594
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

184
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,804
- Man, I don't know, man.
- Yeah, you do.

185
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,389
Six hundred...

186
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,933
Cool. We got a deal.
Now, here's 300 down.

187
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,685
- What's your name?
- Max.

188
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,521
- Max. I'm Vincent.
- All right.

189
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,986
I can't stay double-parked here, though.

190
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,529
I'll meet you in the alley
behind the building.

191
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,822
All right.

192
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,674
Definitely not from around here.

193
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,612
There you go.

194
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,404
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

195
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,702
What the fuck?

196
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,454
What the hell? Damn it!

197
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,457
My man, you all right?

198
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,501
Oh, shit. Fuck.

199
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,176
He... He fell on the cab.

200
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,972
He fell... He fell from up there
on the motherfucking cab.

201
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,808
- Shit. I think he's dead.
- Good guess.

202
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,234
You killed him?

203
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,613
No, I shot him.
Bullets and the fall killed him.

204
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,742
Oh, man. Fuck this, man.

205
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,453
- Red light, Max.
- Hold on. Hold on.

206
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,122
Put your hands down.

207
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,833
- Put your hands down.
- Okay. Okay.

208
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,422
Okay, help me out. Pop the trunk.

209
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,467
- What?
- Pop the trunk.

210
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,639
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.
What you... What you doing?

211
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,265
I'm gonna roll him off the roof.

212
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,975
- Huh?
- Can't leave him here.

213
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,187
So unless you want him up front
with you, but given the hygiene...

214
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,314
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

215
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,733
It's only a dead guy.

216
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,526
Grab his hands.

217
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,821
- I can't do this.
- Grab his wrists.

218
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,411
- You got it?
- Yeah. He's twitching and shit.

219
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,014
Okay. That's good enough.

220
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,897
- Let's go.
- Hey, why don't you just take the cab?

221
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,941
- Take the cab?
- Yeah, you take it.

222
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,361
I'll chill. I'll just chill.
They don't even know who's driving

223
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,114
these things half the time anyway, man.
They never check or anything.

224
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,325
Okay? So just take it. You, me...

225
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,868
You promise not to tell anybody, right?

226
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,037
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

227
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,915
Promise.

228
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,001
- Get in the fucking car.
- You... You...

229
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,711
Get in the car.

230
00:22:52,996 --> 00:23:02,505
Ramone?

231
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:31,992
Ramone!

232
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,600
Fuck.

233
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,864
- Rampart watch commander.
- This is Detective Fanning, Narcotics.

234
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:14,535
Send two black-and-whites and
a night detective to 1039 South Union.

235
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,123
- And contact SID. I got a crime scene.
- Roger. 1039 South Union.

236
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,637
- What are you doing?
- I got to clean it up. It's a mess.

237
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,183
So? Lady Macbeth, we're sitting here,
and the light's green.

238
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,976
Leave the seats.

239
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,732
Asshole!

240
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,403
You no longer have
the cleanest cab in la-la land.

241
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,115
You gotta live with that.
You focus on the job. Drive.

242
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,705
- 7565 Fountain. You know it?
- West Hollywood.

243
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,292
- How long you figure?
- I don't know, man, 17 minutes.

244
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,253
Why?

245
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,756
Oh, no. No, no, no. Hold on, man.

246
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,633
Now, I told you
we had other stops to make tonight.

247
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,718
No, you said
you had to go visit some friends.

248
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,762
- Well, they're somebody's friends.
- No.

249
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,724
You drive a cab, I make my rounds,

250
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,435
you might make it through the night,
come out 700 bucks ahead.

251
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,230
I'm not trying to piss you off,
or nothing like that, but I can't do this.

252
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,649
I can't drive you around
while you go around killing people, man.

253
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,568
- It ain't my job.
- Tonight it is.

254
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,364
Look, you don't get it.
I mean it. I mean it.

255
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,824
I'm... I'm not up for this.

256
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,911
- Okay, hey, hey, hey. You're stressed.
- Yes, I am.

257
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,330
You're stressed. Now, I understand that.

258
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,959
Now, you just keep breathing
and stay calm.

259
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,835
- Are you breathing?
- Shit.

260
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,003
- Are you breathing?
- Yes.

261
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,547
Okay, good.

262
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,970
Okay, look, here's the deal.

263
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,681
Man, you were gonna drive me
around tonight and never be the wiser,

264
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:03,018
but El Gordo got in front of a window,
did his high dive.

265
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,854
We're into plan B. You still breathing?

266
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,817
Now, we gotta make the best of it.
Improvise. Adapt to the environment.

267
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,445
Darwin. Shit happens. I Ching.
Whatever, man. We gotta roll with it.

268
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,699
I Ching. What are you talking about,
man? You threw a man out of a window.

269
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,285
I didn't throw him. He fell.

270
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,913
- Well, what did he do to you?
- What?

271
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,709
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing. I only met him tonight.

272
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,670
You just met him once,
and you kill him like that?

273
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,006
What, I should only kill people
after I get to know them?

274
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,509
- No, man.
- Max, six billion people on the planet,

275
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,678
you're getting bent out of shape
because of one fat guy.

276
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,015
- Well, who was he?
- What do you care?

277
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,517
- Have you ever heard of Rwanda?
- Yes, I know Rwanda.

278
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,936
Tens of thousands
killed before sundown.

279
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,189
Nobody's killed people that fast
since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

280
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,858
- Did you bat an eye, Max?
- What?

281
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,694
Did you join Amnesty International,
Oxfam,

282
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,031
Save the Whale,
Greenpeace or something? No.

283
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,783
I off one fat Angeleno,
and you throw a hissy fit.

284
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,452
Man, I don't know any Rwandans.

285
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,787
You don't know the guy
in the trunk, either.

286
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,247
Man.

287
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,335
Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
he was a criminal

288
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,171
involved in a continuing
criminal enterprise.

289
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,256
What are you doing?
You just taking out the garbage?

290
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,216
Yeah. Something like that.

291
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,636
- Pull over to the right.
- Shit.

292
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,182
- Get rid of them.
- How?

293
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,393
You're a cabby.
Talk yourself out of a ticket.

294
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,733
Just, please, man, don't do anything.

295
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,861
Then don't let me get cornered.
You don't have the trunk space.

296
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,863
- I can't believe this.
- Believe it.

297
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,074
Don't. I'll talk to them.

298
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,287
He's probably married.

299
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,583
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife's pregnant.

300
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,004
Yeah, I'll take care of it. I got it.
I'll deal with it. Yeah. Just a second.

301
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,924
- How you doing?
- Hey.

302
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,051
Hey, my partner's gonna help you out
on that side over there.

303
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,095
License, registration.

304
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,805
Yeah.

305
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,020
I'm pulling you over
because your windshield's smashed.

306
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,024
- All this current?
- Yes, Officer.

307
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,695
Hey, man, what'd you do,
have a food fight in here?

308
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,657
Yeah, I'll... Pretty messy.
Just clean it up.

309
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,370
Hey, is this blood up here
on your windshield?

310
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,871
Yeah.

311
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,125
Yeah, I hit a deer.

312
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,628
- You hit a deer?
- Yeah, over on...

313
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,049
- I was on Slauson.
- A South Central deer?

314
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,511
Yeah, they out there. They...

315
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,055
It ran right in front of the car
and I couldn't avoid it.

316
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,685
- Why you still carrying a passenger?
- I was on my way to the depot and...

317
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,229
I could just drop him.
His drop is on my way.

318
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,190
Yeah, but your cab's unsafe to drive,
and we have to impound it,

319
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,776
so we gotta do a vehicle inventory
before the tow truck gets here.

320
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,862
So pop the trunk
and step out the vehicle.

321
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,406
Sir, I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to call another cab.

322
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,200
Is that really necessary, Officer?
I'm just a half a mile from here.

323
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,745
Yes, sir, I'm afraid it is.
Please, step out the vehicle.

324
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,831
- You, too. Come on.
- If you open that trunk, they go inside.

325
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,001
You know what, man,
it's been a long night.

326
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,462
Plus, the barn is right up there,
you know.

327
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,922
Just give me a break.
This is my first fare.

328
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,925
Get out the cab. Open the trunk.
Come on.

329
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,764
Step out. You, too, sir. Please.

330
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:32,436
This is Rampart Division dispatch.
Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover.

331
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,522
All available Precinct 26 units respond.
Over.

332
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,358
- Hey, partner, we gotta roll.
- Roger. En route.

333
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,779
Go straight to the garage.
Have a nice night, sir.

334
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,927
Stop here.

335
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,663
Hands on the wheel, 10 and 2.

336
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,082
- Why?
- Because I say so.

337
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,678
- Max. Max.
- Shit.

338
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,305
You out there, you son of a bitch?

339
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,269
- Who is that?
- That's Lenny. Just dispatch.

340
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,148
Max, I know you're out there.
Answer the goddamn call.

341
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,985
- What happens if you don't?
- He just keeps calling me.

342
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,778
Max, answer.

343
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,785
Don't blow it.

344
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,374
- Yeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.
- Just got off the phone with the cops.

345
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:21,336
Desk sergeant called to check
you brought the cab in.

346
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,298
- Yeah, so?
- So aside from I hate talking to cops,

347
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,758
they tell me
you crashed the goddamn cab?

348
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,262
No. No, I got crashed into. I didn't...

349
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,390
Do I care what, where or why?
You're paying.

350
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,608
It was an accident. You're not liable.

351
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,277
It was an accident. I'm not liable.

352
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,196
Bullshit. I'm making you liable.
It's coming out of your goddamn pocket.

353
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,073
You tell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

354
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,326
- I can't do that. That's my boss.
- So?

355
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,828
- I need my job.
- No, you don't.

356
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,790
You still there? I'm talking to you.
Max! Max!

357
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,669
- He's not paying you a damn thing.
- Who the hell is this?

358
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,967
Albert Riccardo,
Assistant U.S. Attorney,

359
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,720
a passenger in this cab,
and I'm reporting you to the DMV.

360
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,889
- Let's not get excited.
- Not get excited?

361
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,515
How am I supposed to not get excited,

362
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,601
listening to you
try to extort a working man?

363
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,394
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

364
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,022
and general-liability umbrella
will cover the damages.

365
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,650
Now, what are you trying to pull,
you sarcastic prick?

366
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,693
- I was just trying to...
- Tell it to him.

367
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,696
Here, tell him he's an asshole.
Go ahead.

368
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,782
You're an asshole.

369
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,408
Tell him he pulls this shit again,

370
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,870
you're gonna
stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.

371
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,416
And next time you pull any shit, I'm...

372
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,253
I'm gonna have to stick
this yellow cab up your fat ass.

373
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,229
Shit!

374
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,524
Things like protective orders,
because you think of domestic stalking

375
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,610
where a husband wants his wife back
or boyfriend-girlfriend kind of thing.

376
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,238
We always hear,
"Get your protective order".

377
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,699
Well, a protective order's
a tool that we use,

378
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,119
but oftentimes, it's just
a piece of paper to the stalker.

379
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,370
Yeah.

380
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,247
Mr. Clarke, there's a notary here
to see you.

381
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,999
Well, did he identify himself
as a notary?

382
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,917
Yes, he did.

383
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,336
All right, sure, send him up.

384
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,256
Or shoots them, you know?
That happens all too often.

385
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,758
- But we use it as a tool.
- Yeah, a lot of times, though...

386
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,096
I say a lot of times... In this situation,
strangers may write or call.

387
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,141
But how often, in fact, are stalkers

388
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,353
people that the recipient
of those attentions knows?

389
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,324
Hey! Hey, I'm in the cab!

390
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,452
Hey!

391
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,622
Shit. Down here in the... In the alley!

392
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,958
Shit!

393
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,300
Hey, hold up.

394
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,684
Oh, man, yeah. Hey, yeah, right there.

395
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,313
I'm in the cab, man, I'm stuck.
Thank you. Thank you.

396
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,984
Hey, man.
Hey, look, I gotta get out of here.

397
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,445
- What's up, man? What's going on?
- Look, I'm tied up in here.

398
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,530
This guy tied me up,
but he's up in this building,

399
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,991
wreaking havoc, doing some wild shit.
I need to get out of here.

400
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,743
- You all tied up in there, huh?
- Yeah, I'm trapped,

401
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,620
so just get me out of here
so we can call the cops.

402
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,330
Why don't you give me
your fucking wallet?

403
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,000
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding you?

404
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,254
Listen, don't you see that my hands
are tied to the steering wheel?

405
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,841
I don't give a damn what they're tied to.
I'll fuck you up.

406
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,761
- Don't shoot, man.
- Then get your ass up.

407
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,346
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

408
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,767
What the fuck else you got in here?
Jackpot.

409
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,021
That was for real.

410
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,906
Yo, homey.

411
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:21,993
That my briefcase?

412
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,705
This your briefcase? Yeah, it is.
Why, you want it back?

413
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,707
How about your wallet?

414
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,878
What else you got for me, huh?

415
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,592
Fuck!

416
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,987
Where's the button? Under the dash?

417
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,578
Mind getting it?

418
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,552
You attract attention, you're gonna get
people killed who didn't need to be.

419
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,304
You understand?

420
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,930
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

421
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:36,151
But, hey, new news.
We're ahead of schedule.

422
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,988
- Like jazz?
- Sorry, what?

423
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,825
- Jazz. You like jazz?
- Not that much.

424
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,288
Guy told me about this place
off Crenshaw.

425
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,957
Leimert Park.
All the West Coast greats played there.

426
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:55,670
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,
Chet Baker. Like that.

427
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,925
Come on, finish up. Buy you a drink.

428
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,480
This informant of yours,
what's his name? Ramone?

429
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,942
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

430
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,653
He doesn't show up,
I roll here, find this.

431
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,405
Yeah, how long
you been working this guy?

432
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,282
Four months. He's a low-level player.

433
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,494
Part of a distribution network
that hooks up to Felix.

434
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,496
Felix Reyes-Torrena?

435
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,082
Feds are all over him.
They don't want us anywhere near it.

436
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,542
Since when's LAPD
working for the Feeb?

437
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,128
If they're into it,
they're just gonna take all our stuff,

438
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,673
build their case, take all the credit.
So what is the point?

439
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,841
The point is, is my guy
flew out a window.

440
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,551
So if my CI flies out a window,

441
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,429
then he's got Felix's handprints
on his ass.

442
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,973
That makes it mine.

443
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,977
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

444
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,730
- I just see a bunch of broken glass.
- And blood.

445
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,067
Down here, in the glass.
Here's some more.

446
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:03,154
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

447
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,365
- Richard?
- Yeah, it's me.

448
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,625
Ramone went through that window,
splat.

449
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,255
Glass here, then tires rolled over it.

450
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,841
- Maybe he jumped.
- Sure.

451
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,428
He's depressed, so he jumps four
stories out of a window onto his head.

452
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,388
"Wow, that feels better".
Picks himself up.

453
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,933
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day".

454
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,978
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Ray! Catch.

455
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,360
- Recent?
- You can still smell the cordite.

456
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,947
Old guy across the alley
watching late-night TV

457
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,033
says he saw a cab parked here
earlier tonight

458
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,577
with two guys walking around the hood.

459
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,245
Description? He see anything?

460
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,290
Kind of saw.
Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.

461
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,917
There are 4,000 taxicabs in L.A. County.

462
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,086
- You got anything else?
- That's it.

463
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,923
Okay. Keep knocking.
Let's keep knocking.

464
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,426
Remember that Bay Area deal?
Oakland?

465
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,054
Cabby drove around all night,
killed three people,

466
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,931
- then put the gun to his head.
- Yeah, the guy flipped out. So what?

467
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,768
So that Oakland P.D. detective,
what's-his-name, he never bought it.

468
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,937
Cabby had no criminal record,
no history of mental illness.

469
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,482
Pops three people, then himself?

470
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:26,571
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

471
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,771
I never learned to listen to jazz.

472
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:05,318
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

473
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,530
- Improvising, like tonight.
- Like tonight?

474
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,390
Most people, 10 years from now,

475
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,892
same job, same place, same routine,
everything the same.

476
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,687
Just keeping it safe
over and over and over.

477
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,605
Ten years from now.

478
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,818
Man, you don't know where you'll be
10 minutes from now.

479
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,903
Do you?

480
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:08,590
- Who is that on the trumpet?
- That's Daniel, baby. He's the owner.

481
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:14,012
He's terrific. Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

482
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,307
- I gotta buy him a drink.
- Sure thing, darling.

483
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,776
No, now, see, I was about 19,
bussing tables right here.

484
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,696
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

485
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,616
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

486
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,284
I mean, take this one night.

487
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,579
July 22nd, 1964.
Who you think walks through that door?

488
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,372
Bye, baby.

489
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,875
Miles Davis. That's right.

490
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,168
- In the flesh?
- That's right.

491
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,630
I'm talking about, through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

492
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,006
Jesus.

493
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,634
Anyway, he had been
at a recording session

494
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,721
up at Columbia, up on Vine.
So Miles comes through that door.

495
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:01,476
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

496
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,187
- Well, it had to be...
- Oh, it was scary.

497
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,814
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

498
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,317
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway, man.

499
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,818
I mean, everybody and their mama knew

500
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,947
that you don't just come up
and talk to Miles Davis.

501
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:18,451
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

502
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,747
This one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

503
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,833
And the guy says,
"Hi, my name is..."

504
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,461
Miles said, "Get the fuck out of my face,
you jive motherfucker.

505
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,089
"Take your silly bitch with you".

506
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,134
You know? That's...
That was Miles, man.

507
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,847
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

508
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,432
But did you get to talk to him?

509
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,101
- Better than that.
- No.

510
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,771
- I played for about 20 minutes.
- Unbelievable.

511
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,773
- How'd you do?
- How'd I do?

512
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,859
Well, you really ain't shit when
you're playing next to Miles Davis.

513
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,153
But he carried my ass.

514
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,532
- What'd he say?
- He said one word, "Cool".

515
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,534
- "Cool"?
- Yeah.

516
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,119
- That's it?
- Yeah.

517
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,496
That meant, "Good, but not ready".

518
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,249
It meant, "Look me up when you are".

519
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,710
- Did you?
- No.

520
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,714
I got drafted
and got into some other things,

521
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:17,260
and by the time I got back to music,
the season had passed.

522
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:21,180
But, you know, I was born in 1945,

523
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,143
but that night was
the moment of my conception.

524
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,354
- Right here in this room.
- Crowd's not here now.

525
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,608
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

526
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,403
What a great story.

527
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:40,158
I gotta tell the people in Culiacàn
and Cartagena that story.

528
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,633
You know the folks in Culiacàn
and Cartagena?

529
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,134
Afraid so.

530
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,347
Man, just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

531
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,892
I am a cool guy,
with a job I contracted to do.

532
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,102
Come on, Vincent,
give the dude a pass.

533
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,687
- I'm working here.
- No, listen. You the one

534
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,564
sitting here talking about improvisation.

535
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,524
You like the guy, you like how he plays.

536
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,152
- Let's just play a little jazz. Come on.
- Improv...

537
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,613
That's funny, coming from you.

538
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,871
How's this? I'll ask a question.

539
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,874
- What question?
- A jazz question.

540
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,086
Now, you get it right, we roll.

541
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,381
You disappear tonight.

542
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,966
If I walk out of here tonight,

543
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:43,054
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

544
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,514
And one more thing.

545
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:48,226
These people and their rep here, Felix,

546
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,728
well, you tell them I'm sorry.

547
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:55,566
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

548
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,778
I was compelled.
It was either play ball or go back inside.

549
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,823
And I'm not going back inside.

550
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,369
Yeah.

551
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,416
Lay it on me.

552
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,335
Where did Miles learn music?

553
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,254
I know everything
there is to know about Miles.

554
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,755
Then let's have it.

555
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,967
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

556
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,886
His father was a dentist, East St Louis.

557
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,888
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

558
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,350
He sent Miles
to Juilliard School of Music,

559
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,769
New York, 1945.

560
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,062
Man.

561
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,370
Dropped out of Juilliard
after less than a year.

562
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,873
Tracked down Charlie Parker
on 52nd Street,

563
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,917
who mentored him
for the next three years.

564
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,902
- Hey.
- No. No, I'm done.

565
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,904
- Find you another cab.
- Max.

566
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,740
Leave me alone. I'm collateral anyway.

567
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,248
I am not playing.

568
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,586
You played him, man.

569
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:44,008
He got the answer right,
would you have let him go?

570
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,598
This is 102. This is 102. Max?

571
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,309
- What is it with this guy?
- Max?

572
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,239
- You hassling my driver again?
- Who are you?

573
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,866
The same guy you talked to last time.

574
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,370
Max's mother's driving me crazy.
Put him on the line, please.

575
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,830
Hang on.

576
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,499
Carefully.

577
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,752
Yeah.

578
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,295
Your mother's calling every 10 minutes.

579
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,756
Why didn't you show?
Are you all right? Where are you?

580
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,424
Show for what?

581
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,636
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

582
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,097
I'm not related to you.
You tell her yourself.

583
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,890
Show up for what?

584
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,978
She's in the hospital.

585
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,564
- You visit every night?
- Yeah. What difference does it make?

586
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,483
- You don't show up, it breaks routine.
- So?

587
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:46,404
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

588
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,950
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

589
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,704
Since when was any of this negotiable?

590
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,754
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

591
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,137
Hey. Flowers?

592
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,516
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

593
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,854
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

594
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,861
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

595
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,238
Excuse me. Keep the change.

596
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,960
Hold that elevator, please.

597
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,673
- Floor?
- Five. Thanks.

598
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,521
- Having a good night?
- Maso maso. You?

599
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,240
Excuse me.

600
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,901
Hey, Ma.

601
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,323
- I've been calling and calling.
- Yeah, well, I got caught up at work.

602
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,492
Why couldn't you call me
on the telephone?

603
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,412
I'm lying here wondering
if something terrible happened to you.

604
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,788
I brought you flowers.

605
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,249
- What am I gonna do with flowers?
- Cheer up.

606
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,625
How?

607
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:09,588
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just gonna wilt and die?

608
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,382
See what I mean?

609
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,551
I didn't buy you the flowers, Mom.
He did.

610
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,885
Who?

611
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,643
Why didn't you tell me
we had company?

612
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:28,274
What's your name?
Sorry my son is rude.

613
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,484
No harm done, ma'am.

614
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,070
You paid for my flowers?

615
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,947
They're beautiful.

616
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,665
Well, Max?

617
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:52,256
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

618
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,678
I'm very happy to meet you,
Mrs. Durocher.

619
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,513
Oh, just call me Ida.

620
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,642
Ida. I was with Max when he got the call.

621
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,853
And you came all the way
over here to see me?

622
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,148
- It's nothing, ma'am.
- Tell my son.

623
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:13,319
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

624
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,781
You must be one of Max's
important clients.

625
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:21,327
Client? I... You know, I like
to think of myself as his friend.

626
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,162
Max never had many friends.

627
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,123
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It's unhealthy.

628
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,667
Mom, how many times I got to ask you?
Please don't do that.

629
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,835
Do what?

630
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,005
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

631
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,381
What's he saying?

632
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:38,052
He says he's standing right here,
in the room here.

633
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,096
Yes, you are.

634
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,057
- He's sensitive.
- I know.

635
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,809
But I'm sure you're very proud of him.

636
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,854
Of course I'm proud.
He started with nothing, you know.

637
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,982
- Look at him today. Here, Vegas...
- Mom. Mom.

638
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,277
Mom. Mom, he is not interested
in hearing about all that, okay?

639
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,738
I came to see you, I saw you.
You look good, let's go.

640
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,283
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

641
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,245
- Limousine companies.
- Is that right?

642
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,664
He drives famous people around.

643
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:11,085
Famous people. Limousine companies.
Now that's quite an achievement.

644
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,170
What did you say your name was again?

645
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,172
My name's Vincent, ma'am.

646
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,510
- Visit again?
- No, I'm just in town tonight.

647
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,971
- When you come back.
- Sure.

648
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,115
Max!

649
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,243
Don't!

650
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:59,443
All of my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

651
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,992
Let's see what else you can do.

652
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,875
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

653
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,966
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

654
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,139
No, next.

655
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,559
Okay, you know, something's funny
about this, though, you know?

656
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,730
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

657
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:41,277
The kid and that last guy,
both done by the same shooter, I think.

658
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,947
- Why do you say that?
- Wound pattern.

659
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,118
Two in the sternum, one in the head.

660
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,579
This guy, he's shooting tight
groups too, all right? Check this out.

661
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,791
Double taps a couple millimeters apart.

662
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,668
Let's see this one.

663
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,929
See what I mean?

664
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,642
- Holy shit. Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

665
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,067
Come on, come on, wake up.

666
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,043
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Fanning.

667
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,503
I'm still down here at the morgue
at Sisters of Charity.

668
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,922
Those John Does didn't pan out,
but you're never gonna guess

669
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,633
- who I got here in the meat locker.
- Who?

670
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:50,846
Sylvester Clarke, criminal attorney
turned lawyer-criminal.

671
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,726
Including Ramone, who he represented,
who's still missing.

672
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,979
The both of whom are in the
exotic-substances business together.

673
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,691
There's something going on,
and I don't think the feds know about it.

674
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,070
Tell you what, stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone.

675
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,322
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.

676
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,573
Good.

677
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,706
You're gonna go to a place
called El Rodeo.

678
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,792
It's on Washington Boulevard
in Pico Rivera.

679
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,628
- Where at on Washington?
- Look it up.

680
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,051
Limos, huh?

681
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,595
Don't start.

682
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,014
Hey, I'm not the one lying to my mother.

683
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,975
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

684
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,311
Yeah, right.
Maybe she hears what you tell her.

685
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,271
Whatever I tell her
is never good enough anyway.

686
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,482
It's always been that way.

687
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,736
- So what's at El Rodeo?
- Just drive.

688
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,615
They project onto you their flaws.

689
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:55,285
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

690
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,496
They rank on you instead.

691
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,251
- How do you know?
- I had a father like that.

692
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,837
Mothers are worse.

693
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,589
Wouldn't know.
My mother died before I remember.

694
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,008
What happened to your father?

695
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,469
Hated everything I did.

696
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:18,058
Got drunk, beat me up, foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

697
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,438
Then what?

698
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,025
I killed him.

699
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,070
I was 12.

700
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,788
I'm kidding.

701
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,835
He died of liver disease.

702
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,923
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

703
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,774
So what is this
"driving a cab temporarily"?

704
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,695
- It's just all bullshit, huh?
- It is not bullshit.

705
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,697
Twelve years isn't temporary, Max.

706
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:17,493
Gotta get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

707
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,369
Gotta staff up, get the right client list.

708
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,539
It's not just simply get the car
and put asses in the seats.

709
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,707
Why not?

710
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:27,336
Because Island Limos
is more than just a ride.

711
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,631
It's a... Like a club experience.
Cool groove.

712
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,010
Don't want it to end.
It's gotta be perfect.

713
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,930
Perfect.

714
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,683
It's up here. Turn right.

715
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,832
- Give me your wallet. Come on.
- Give you my wallet. For what?

716
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,836
I'll hold it for you in case
the people inside search you.

717
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,631
- Who's searching?
- The people inside.

718
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,425
Go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.

719
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,635
- Felix.
- Yeah.

720
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,221
- What does he look like?
- I don't know, I've never met him.

721
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,847
Who is he?

722
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,433
He's connected to the guys
who hired me.

723
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,769
- I don't get it.
- You destroyed my workups.

724
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,396
Number four's due.
What'd you think, night's over?

725
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,523
Called on account of rain?

726
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,817
You go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

727
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,069
They'll be on flash drive or CD.

728
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,154
- Me? How come you don't go?
- I don't meet people.

729
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,823
Risk management. Anonymity.
I protect mine.

730
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,324
You're not gonna screw that up.

731
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,452
I got a contract with their bosses.
These guys don't get to meet me.

732
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,038
They don't know what I look like.

733
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,251
If I don't pull it off, then...

734
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,837
They will kill you.
Now, you got 10 minutes.

735
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,589
At 10:01, I drive to the hospital

736
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,591
and execute your mother
on my way out of town.

737
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,428
- And don't pretend indifference.
- I can't do this. I can't.

738
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,556
What are you talking about?
Sure you can, man. Come on. Hey. Hey.

739
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,976
Look, man, if I do this, I'm just gonna
end up getting other people killed.

740
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,311
Out of options, Max.

741
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,689
Just take comfort in knowing
you never had a choice.

742
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,192
- How long you been doing this?
- Why?

743
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,403
Just in case they ask me.

744
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:20,657
- Private sector, six years.
- Okay. All right, six years.

745
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:25,203
You get benefits?
Or, you know, like, insurance? Pension?

746
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:29,082
No. No paid sick leave. Quit stalling.
Get out of the cab.

747
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,237
- Yeah? Hold up.
- Hold on, man.

748
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,373
Who is this?

749
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,128
Mark the time.

750
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,177
All right, it's cool.

751
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,518
- Qué pasa? What's up, homes?
- Hey. What's up?

752
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,730
I'm here to see Felix.
He has something for me.

753
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,649
Don't know no Felix.

754
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,822
Tell him...

755
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,576
Vince... Say it's Vincent.

756
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,079
I'm Vincent.

757
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,136
Copy.

758
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,141
Let him in. Let him in right now.
Go ahead.

759
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,382
Detective Richard Weidner, LAPD,
Major Narcotics Division.

760
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,176
Detective Ray Fanning, LAPD,
Major Narcotics...

761
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,678
Hi, yeah, okay, how are you?
Agent Frank Pedrosa.

762
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,180
Good. Thanks for seeing us, Frank.

763
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,931
Yeah, you're welcome. How can I help?

764
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,933
What's up? Why do you wanna know
about our case?

765
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,519
- Any unusual activity tonight?
- Like what?

766
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,855
That relates to a murder
or a series of murders

767
01:02:56,939 --> 01:03:00,025
in Wilshire Central or West Hollywood?

768
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,194
All quiet on the western front.

769
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,988
Various people are asleep.
Various people are not.

770
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:08,658
They come and go in cars,
pickups, taxis.

771
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,369
Other than that, we watch air move.

772
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,664
- Your interest in our case?
- Well, our interest...

773
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,792
We got a situation. Two bodies.

774
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,377
Could be a coincidence,
could not be a coincidence.

775
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,796
It doesn't look like one.

776
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,051
- We got an attorney and his client...
- Roof's all beat to shit.

777
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,220
Roof's all beat to shit.

778
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,389
Can you zoom in on this, please?

779
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,308
- On what?
- On that.

780
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,691
- Look at that right there.
- What is it?

781
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:49,533
Yeah. 5-Queen-49974.

782
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,910
5Q49974.

783
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,385
I thought you'd be taller.

784
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,181
So, Vincent.

785
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,563
- What are the two names?
- Ramone Ayala and Clarke.

786
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:04,274
Are you telling me Ramone Ayala
and Clarke were murdered tonight?

787
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,359
- Both killed?
- Sylvester Clarke for sure.

788
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,486
- Ramone, I don't know.
- I got another DOA.

789
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,156
Daniel Baker out of South Central,
Leimert Park.

790
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,449
That's three.

791
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,576
- Three what?
- Witnesses.

792
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:21,541
Vincent meet their people
in Culiacàn or Cartagena.

793
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,045
But he don't meet you. Okay.

794
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,632
Now you're here.

795
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:31,968
Why?

796
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,265
I lost my stuff.

797
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,101
The list.

798
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,440
I want you to listen to me real well.

799
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,153
Special groups put together
the list of dedos.

800
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:52,864
- Dedos?
- Fingers. Informants.

801
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:59,371
Signal interceptions with
voice-recognition software, surveillance.

802
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:03,208
A very expensive counterintelligence
worked up that list.

803
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,836
An important list. Wouldn't you say?

804
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,632
And you lost it?

805
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,469
Yeah.

806
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,971
I'm sorry.

807
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,682
Sorry.

808
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,017
Sorry?

809
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:24,729
Sorry does not put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

810
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,276
- Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
- No.

811
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,321
- Do you believe in Santa Claus?
- No.

812
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,240
Nor do I.

813
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,284
Nor do I, but my children do.
They are still small.

814
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:42,914
But do you know who they like even
better than Santa Claus? His helper.

815
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:47,544
Pedro el Negro. Black Peter. Yeah.

816
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,674
There's an old Mexican tale
that tells of how Santa Claus

817
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:55,385
got so very busy looking out
for the good children

818
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:59,014
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.

819
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,182
So he hired Pedro.

820
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,226
And Santa Claus gave him a list

821
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,771
with all the names
of all the bad children.

822
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,691
And Pedro would come every night
to check them out.

823
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,777
And the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,

824
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,363
that were not saying their prayers,

825
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:19,909
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows,

826
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,911
a little burro.

827
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,872
And he would come back.

828
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,874
And if the children
were still misbehaving,

829
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:29,252
Pedro would take them away,
and nobody would ever see them again.

830
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:34,674
Now, if I am being Santa Claus,
and you are Pedro,

831
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,470
how do you think jolly old
Santa Claus would feel

832
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:42,015
if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, "I lost the list"?

833
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,310
How fucking furious
do you think he would get?

834
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,063
Tell me, Vincent.

835
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:50,565
Tell me what you think.

836
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,402
What?

837
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,656
I think...

838
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:05,121
I think you should tell the guy

839
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,500
behind me to put that gun down.

840
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,378
What did you say?

841
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,340
I said, I think you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away

842
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:19,177
before I take it
and beat his bitch ass to death with it.

843
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,356
I picked up a tail.

844
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,067
- Federal?
- I don't know, you tell me.

845
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,363
That's why I tossed the list.

846
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,199
The workups, all of that shit.

847
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:45,411
To protect, in part, your

848
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,748
Hermès, Façonnable ass.

849
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,923
What do you think,
I like coming in here?

850
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,427
But, hey, shit happens.

851
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:04,597
Gotta roll with it. Adapt.

852
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,433
Darwin. I Ching.

853
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,980
- Has...
- The fat man, the penthouse guy,

854
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,606
the jazz man.

855
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,943
That leaves two.

856
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,620
Can you finish?

857
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,582
In six years,

858
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,295
when have I not?

859
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,881
Say it's Vincent.

860
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,549
I'm Vincent.

861
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,260
Say it's Vincent.

862
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,095
I'm Vincent.

863
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,930
Say it's Vincent.

864
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,058
I'm Vincent.

865
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,852
- Say it's Vincent.
- Vincent?

866
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:53,938
- That's what I'm hearing.
- I'm Vincent.

867
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,671
Your last two.

868
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:26,095
And by the way,
as a token of my appreciation,

869
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,973
I would like to offer you a discount.

870
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:34,103
For all my services, 25%.

871
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,023
- Very generous.
- Hell, make it 35.

872
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,735
And, by the way,

873
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,032
Daniel said he was sorry.

874
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,996
Interesting.

875
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,871
- E-mail me his license.
- All right?

876
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,915
- Right.
- To my cell phone.

877
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,583
No, no, I'll wait.

878
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,461
Hey, is there anybody else in that cab?

879
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,064
Vegas odds would've been against you
walking out of there.

880
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,275
Yeah, I'm very impressive.

881
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:09,449
Sixth Street by Alexandria,
a club called Fever. You know it?

882
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,295
Locate our witness, Peter Lim.
Get him evacuated, get him safe.

883
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,630
- LA 101 to chase units.
- Yeah.

884
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,591
African-American, medium build.

885
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,968
The assault team, when they're
in place, will do the takedown.

886
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,678
- Are you sure?
- Do not spook him before.

887
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,680
I want air support up
and to maintain at 1500 feet.

888
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:33,931
Thank you.

889
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,106
- How long?
- Twelve minutes.

890
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,275
According to the
cab company's dispatch unit,

891
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,569
this guy's been driving that cab
for 12 years.

892
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,404
- So what?
- So you're telling me

893
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,282
the guy walks into a phone booth
and, shazam,

894
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,493
changes into a meat-eater
super-assassin?

895
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,870
What's he do,
squeeze them in between fares?

896
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:58,373
No, the real cab driver
is floating down a storm drain.

897
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,541
The guy who walked out of there
looks like this guy.

898
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,710
'Cause he picked a cab driver
who looks like him.

899
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:06,130
- Yeah, I don't know.
- I do. Zee?

900
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,467
We see private-sector security
companies hiring out to cartels

901
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,719
in Colombia, Russia, Mexico,

902
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,516
hiring ex-Special Forces, Stasi,
ex-KGB, like that, all the time.

903
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:20,812
Guys with trigger time, skill sets, real
tradecraft, like, look like a cab driver.

904
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,897
What are you gonna do?

905
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,650
Take his ass down. Save our witness.

906
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:32,657
What if these guys are wrong?

907
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,118
They got the guy admitting
his name is Vincent.

908
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:38,121
- He's in there talking to the bad guys.
- There is something else going on.

909
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:41,666
Ray, there's nothing else going on.
I thought there was, there isn't.

910
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:44,460
It's their ball, it's their game.
There's nothing in it for us.

911
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,462
- There's nothing in it for you.
- That's right.

912
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:50,049
It's late. I'm going home.
You know what time it is?

913
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,519
They locate Peter Lim yet?

914
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,319
Sheila's on with the wife.
She thinks he's at Fever.

915
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,070
Sixth and Alexandria. Move it.

916
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:57,158
LA 101 to LA 103, LA 105, LA 108.

917
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,869
Witness is in a club called Fever,
Sixth and Alexandria.

918
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:01,370
That's where Vincent is going.

919
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,789
Assault team and remaining unit,
you will take Vincent.

920
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,168
First unit on the scene will get
the witness, Peter Lim. Get him out.

921
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:10,546
LA 105 to LA 101. Copy that.

922
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:47,875
- You gonna call her?
- Who?

923
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,546
You know, your lady friend, the one
who gave you her business card.

924
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,800
- I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.
- What?

925
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,761
Pick up the phone.

926
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:02,515
Life's short. One day, it's gone.

927
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:11,691
You and I make it out of this alive,
you should call her.

928
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,651
That's what I think.

929
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,154
Anyway...

930
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,093
There he is. Hit it.

931
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,167
Let's do it.

932
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,971
Table towards the back
is where he hangs.

933
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:02,319
Wilke, take the right.
Brian, hold the door.

934
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,489
Clean shots. Watch your backgrounds.
Watch your backgrounds.

935
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:06,949
LAPD.

936
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,131
You move 15 feet ahead,
3 feet to the left.

937
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:07,968
Wander, innocent bystanders
get the first rounds. Clear?

938
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:53,490
There's Lim. Second booth from the left.
Get him out of here.

939
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,502
Middle of the dance floor.
Freeze, Vincent!

940
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:09,757
FBI! FBI! Get your hands in the air!
Get your hands in the air, Vincent!

941
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:13,177
- Freeze! Get your hands up!
- FBI. Where's Peter Lim?

942
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,638
FBI! Get your hands in the air!

943
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,848
Drop it!

944
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:21,018
- Freeze!
- Freeze! FBI!

945
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,520
- I'm not Vincent.
- FBI!

946
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,107
Yo, put the gun down!
You got the wrong...

947
01:22:57,555 --> 01:23:00,224
Pedrosa's been shot. Get an RA unit.

948
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,036
No, no, no! Wait, wait!

949
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,445
Hey, hey! Hold on. Hold on.
I'm Detective Fanning.

950
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:55,612
I'm Max! I'm Max!

951
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,948
I'm a goddamn cab driver, man!
I'm a goddamn cab driver.

952
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:02,077
I know. I know. I'm getting you
out of here. I'm LAPD. Come on.

953
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,075
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. You're okay.

954
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,327
Just move it. Keep moving.

955
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:53,754
You're okay.

956
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:57,758
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. You're okay.

957
01:24:57,842 --> 01:25:00,260
You're okay. You're all right.

958
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,646
Let's go!

959
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:14,525
Let's go.

960
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,993
Go! Drive! Drive!

961
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:06,118
Only thing didn't show up
is the Polish cavalry.

962
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:09,663
You're alive. I saved you.

963
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:16,712
Do I get any thanks? No.
All you can do is clam up.

964
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,593
You wanna talk?
Do you want me to fuck off?

965
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,094
Fuck off.

966
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,892
- You had to kill Fanning?
- Who the fuck is Fanning?

967
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,727
Fanning, the cop.

968
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,314
Why'd you have to kill him?

969
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:38,650
He's probably got a family.
Kids are gonna grow up without him.

970
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,652
He believed me.

971
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:42,905
Oh, I should've saved him
because he believed you.

972
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,740
- No, no. Not that.
- Yeah. That.

973
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:46,366
Well, yeah, that.
What's wrong with that?

974
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,911
- It's what I do for a living.
- Some living.

975
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:51,205
- Head downtown.
- What's downtown?

976
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:55,292
How are you at math?
I was hired for five hits. I did four.

977
01:26:57,337 --> 01:27:01,048
Why didn't you just kill me
and get another cab driver?

978
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:03,592
Because you're good.
We're in this together.

979
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:05,677
Fates intertwined.
Cosmic coincidence, you know.

980
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:08,597
- Come on. You full of shit.
- All that crap. I'm full of shit?

981
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:10,766
You're a monument of it.
You even bullshitted yourself.

982
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,310
"All I am is taking out the garbage,
killing bad people".

983
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,521
- Well, that's what you said.
- You believed me?

984
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:20,651
- Then what'd they do?
- How do I know, you know?

985
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:25,948
They all got that "witness for
the prosecution" look to me.

986
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:28,116
Probably some major
federal indictment of somebody

987
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:31,203
who majorly does not
wanna get indicted.

988
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,413
So that's the reason?

989
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,666
That's the why. There's no reason.

990
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,544
There's no good reason,
there's no bad reason to live or to die.

991
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,630
Then what are you?

992
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:43,257
Indifferent.

993
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,511
Get with it.

994
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,846
Millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars

995
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,516
and a speck on one in a blink.

996
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:55,227
That's us. Lost in space.

997
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:59,147
The cop, you, me, who notices?

998
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,367
What's with you?

999
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,495
As in?

1000
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:16,081
As in, if somebody had a gun
to your head and said,

1001
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:18,750
"You gotta tell me what's going on
with this person over here

1002
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:20,877
"or I'm gonna kill you.

1003
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:25,716
"What is driving him?
What was he thinking?"

1004
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,009
You know, you couldn't do it, could you?

1005
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:29,970
Because they would
have to kill your ass,

1006
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,932
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.

1007
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:38,937
I think you're low, my brother. Way low.

1008
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:43,942
Like, what were you? One of those
institutionalized-raised guys?

1009
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,944
Anybody home?

1010
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,865
And... And the standard parts that
are supposed to be there in people,

1011
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:52,701
in you, aren't.

1012
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,500
And why haven't you killed me yet?

1013
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:08,008
Of all the cabbies in L.A., I get Max,
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.

1014
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,969
Answer the question.

1015
01:29:13,222 --> 01:29:15,057
Look in the mirror.

1016
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,727
Paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.

1017
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:21,897
- How much you got saved?
- That ain't none of your business.

1018
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:25,400
Someday?
"Someday my dream will come"?

1019
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:28,737
One night you'll wake up,
and you'll discover it never happened.

1020
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:33,158
It's all turned around on you.
It never will. Suddenly you are old.

1021
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,078
Didn't happen.

1022
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:39,206
And it never will, because you
were never gonna do it anyway.

1023
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:42,417
You'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your Barcalounger,

1024
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:46,922
being hypnotized by daytime TV
for the rest of your life.

1025
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:49,007
Don't you talk to me about murder.

1026
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:53,136
All it ever took was a down payment
on a Lincoln Town Car.

1027
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,306
Or that girl. You can't even call that girl.

1028
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,352
What the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?

1029
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,665
Because I never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?

1030
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,751
Myself. I should have.

1031
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:28,171
I've tried to gamble my way
out from under

1032
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,383
but that was just a born-to-lose deal.

1033
01:30:31,467 --> 01:30:33,510
- Slow down.
- It's gotta be perfect.

1034
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:37,264
It's got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.

1035
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:42,060
I could've done it anytime I wanted to.

1036
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,562
Red light.

1037
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:52,863
But you know what? New news.

1038
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:56,074
It doesn't matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?

1039
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:59,870
We're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.

1040
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:01,913
Twilight Zone shit.

1041
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:10,213
Says the badass sociopath
in my back seat.

1042
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:17,804
But you know what? That's the one thing
I gotta thank you for, bro.

1043
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:21,224
Because until now,
I never looked at it that way.

1044
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:27,189
What does it matter?
It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.

1045
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:30,358
What do we got to lose anyway, right?

1046
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:32,861
- Slow down.
- Why? You gonna shoot me?

1047
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:34,446
You gonna pull the trigger and kill us?

1048
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,406
- Go ahead, shoot my ass.
- Slow the hell down.

1049
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,409
You gonna shoot me? You gonna
shoot me now? You gonna kill us?

1050
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,245
Well, shoot my ass, then.
Huh? Shoot me.

1051
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,456
- Slow down!
- You're right.

1052
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,792
You know what, Vincent?

1053
01:31:48,377 --> 01:31:50,212
Go fuck yourself!

1054
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:26,498
- Well, that was brilliant.
- Didn't have your seat belt on?

1055
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:07,372
1-L-20, show me code 6
at Olympic and Figueroa

1056
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,082
on a TC with injuries.

1057
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:12,836
- Copy your location.
- Sir, are you okay? What happened?

1058
01:33:14,213 --> 01:33:16,506
Sir, you were involved in an accident.

1059
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,925
An ambulance is on its way to help you.

1060
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:23,179
You understand what I'm saying to you?
Sit down and relax, okay?

1061
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,685
Okay. Don't worry about the cab.
They'll get you a new one.

1062
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,230
Relax and breathe.

1063
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:48,038
Put your hands up.

1064
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:51,416
Put your hands up. Face the cab.
Get down on your knees.

1065
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,960
- Go ahead and arrest me.
- Put your hands on top of your head.

1066
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,712
Take me to jail. L.A. County jail's great.

1067
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,882
Don't move!
Put your hands behind your head.

1068
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,973
1-L-20, I need a backup
on a 187 suspect.

1069
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:22,489
- Put your gun down!
- Get back! Put your hands down!

1070
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:24,366
- Look, I gotta go.
- Put down the gun!

1071
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,701
Stop moving! Stop moving!

1072
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:29,120
When did this become a negotiation?

1073
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,667
Clap your hands together.
Hold your hands together.

1074
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:37,128
Listen, somebody's gonna get killed
if I don't go right now.

1075
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,673
Now, cuff yourself.

1076
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:42,717
I'm going to Sixth and Fig.
Call the cops.

1077
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:03,530
- Give me that.
- Hey, hey! Whoa! Fuck!

1078
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:32,225
Come on!

1079
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:04,299
Come on. Go through.

1080
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:08,595
Come on. Come on. Pick up.

1081
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:28,448
Pick up.

1082
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:31,701
Come on, girl.

1083
01:36:32,995 --> 01:36:34,120
Come on, pick up.

1084
01:36:58,187 --> 01:36:59,437
U.S. Attorney's Office.

1085
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:00,772
- Annie!
- Yes.

1086
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:04,734
It's Max. Max, the cab driver.
Listen to me, all right?

1087
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,528
- A guy named Vincent...
- Max.

1088
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:08,696
Listen to me, Annie.

1089
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:12,826
- It's kind of a strange time to be calling.
- Listen. Listen, Annie.

1090
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:16,454
There's a man named Vincent.
He's coming to kill you.

1091
01:37:17,289 --> 01:37:20,291
- He's what?
- Kill you! He's coming to kill you!

1092
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,919
He was scoping out the building
when I dropped you off...

1093
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:25,380
Okay, you know what?
Max, if this is supposed to be

1094
01:37:25,464 --> 01:37:27,423
some type ofjoke, it's not funny.

1095
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,676
It's not a joke. Listen to me.
Annie, listen to me, please.

1096
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,930
Felix hired him. Okay?
Or people that Felix worked for.

1097
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:36,641
Felix Reyes-Torrena.
How do you know about my case?

1098
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:38,434
I don't understand what's going on.

1099
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,645
All I know is that
he's already killed witnesses.

1100
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,856
He's coming to kill you.

1101
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,941
When I dropped you off,
I don't know how it happened,

1102
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:47,277
but he ended up in my cab.

1103
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:07,964
Annie.

1104
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:11,217
Annie, listen. All I want you to do...

1105
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,603
- I don't understand what's going on.
- Annie, listen. Listen.

1106
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:23,646
- Max.
- Please listen.

1107
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:48,087
Get out of the building. Annie.

1108
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:53,635
Okay, I'm leaving the building right now.

1109
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:55,470
No, no, no, wait.

1110
01:38:55,554 --> 01:38:57,430
- Max.
- Wait, wait.

1111
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:01,309
- Max.
- Listen, where are you right now?

1112
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:03,144
- What floor?
- I'm on the sixteenth floor.

1113
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:05,480
I'm in the law library and files.

1114
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:07,941
He's two floors below you, corner office.

1115
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:09,400
In my office?

1116
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:10,944
Listen, he does not know
you're up there.

1117
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:12,528
Just stay right there and call 911.

1118
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,364
Max, are you sure
he's on the fourteenth floor?

1119
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:18,534
Listen, just stay there and just call
the police. Just call the police.

1120
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:19,786
Max?

1121
01:39:23,582 --> 01:39:24,749
Shit.

1122
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:32,799
Max?

1123
01:39:39,264 --> 01:39:40,473
Shit.

1124
01:39:46,605 --> 01:39:50,024
- Max.
- Annie, he knows you're up there. Just...

1125
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:51,484
I can't hear you. Hello?

1126
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:53,736
Annie. Annie, listen to me.

1127
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:56,155
Shit.

1128
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:00,159
Annie. Annie!

1129
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:03,579
Shit.

1130
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:01,471
911. Operator.

1131
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:04,307
Yes. Listen, there is a man
in my building, and he is...

1132
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:10,188
Hello?

1133
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:21,295
Let her go.

1134
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,880
Max?

1135
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,969
Why? What are you gonna do about it?

1136
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,015
Come on.

1137
01:44:46,029 --> 01:44:47,196
Max!

1138
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:11,178
- Oh, God. Felix Reyes-Torrena?
- Yeah. I met him.

1139
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:13,180
What do you mean, you met him? How?

1140
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:16,767
I don't know. Look, when I
dropped you off, there was a fare.

1141
01:45:16,893 --> 01:45:19,687
- He said his name is Vincent.
- Vincent?

1142
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:28,946
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- This is the street.

1143
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,866
This way. Come on.

1144
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,605
Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.

1145
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:05,816
- What we gonna do?
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1146
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:07,651
No, no. This way.

1147
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:32,635
Wait, wait. Wait. Wait.

1148
01:46:56,326 --> 01:46:57,660
Stay down.

1149
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:47,042
Shit.

1150
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:56,760
There's a station.

1151
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:38,886
Shit.

1152
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:15,256
Max!

1153
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,343
I do this for a living!

1154
01:50:30,373 --> 01:50:34,043
We're almost at the next stop.

1155
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,213
Hey, Max.

1156
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:45,888
A guy gets on the MTA here in L.A.
and dies.

1157
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:53,228
Think anybody will notice?
