1
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:06,949
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

2
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,585
Do you speak English?

3
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:10,683
Yeah.

4
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:13,617
No. I'm sorry,
my German is not very good.

5
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,528
Have you heard that
as couples age...

6
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,199
...they lose their ability
to hear each other?

7
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,389
No.

8
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:29,137
Supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear high-pitched sounds...

9
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,331
...and women lose hearing
in the low end.

10
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:34,141
I guess they nullify each other.

11
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:37,507
I guess. Nature's way of allowing
couples to grow old together...

12
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,579
...without killing each other.

13
00:04:41,718 --> 00:04:43,084
What are you reading?

14
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:45,451
Oh, yeah.

15
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:47,488
How about you?

16
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:08,401
I was thinking about going
to the lounge car.

17
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:11,646
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

18
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,846
Okay.

19
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,362
How do you speak such good English?

20
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:38,235
I went to school for a summer
in Los Angeles.

21
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,005
- It's fine here?
- Yeah, this is good.

22
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:44,180
And I spent some time in London.

23
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:48,146
- Wow.
- How do you speak such good English?

24
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,012
Me? I'm American.

25
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:53,290
- You're American? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:57,518
No, I'm joking.
I knew you were American.

27
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,355
And you don't speak
any other language, right?

28
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,829
Yeah, yeah.
I get it, I get it.

29
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,228
I'm the crude, dumb,
vulgar American...

30
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:10,168
...who doesn't speak other languages,
who has no culture. But I tried.

31
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:14,002
I took French in high school.
When I first got to Paris...

32
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,576
...I stood in line
at the metro station.

33
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:17,975
I was practicing.

34
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:23,711
Whatever.

35
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:30,418
And I get up there,
and I look at this woman...

36
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:35,564
...and my mind goes blank. And I say,
"I need a ticket to get to..."

37
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,233
So anyway...

38
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:40,463
So where are you headed?

39
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,735
Well, back to Paris.

40
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,238
- My classes start next week.
- You're still in school? Where?

41
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:48,534
La Sorbonne. You know?

42
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:49,803
Sure.

43
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,340
You're coming from Budapest?

44
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,576
- I was visiting my grandmother.
- Oh. How is she?

45
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,312
She's okay.

46
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,684
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

47
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,024
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

48
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,355
Vienna?
What's there?

49
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:09,759
No idea.
I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

50
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,524
You're on holiday?

51
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:18,098
I don't really know what I'm on.
You know?

52
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:22,606
I've just been traveling around,
riding trains for two or three weeks.

53
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:25,713
You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

54
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,440
I had a friend in Madrid, but...

55
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:31,177
- Madrid, that's nice.
- I got a Eurail pass...

56
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:32,480
...is what I did.

57
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:33,816
That's great.

58
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:38,593
So has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

59
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:41,697
Yeah, sure. It's been...
It sucked.

60
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:43,593
What?

61
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:46,692
It's had its...

62
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:50,540
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end
looking out the window...

63
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,004
...has actually been kind of great.

64
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:56,036
What do you mean?

65
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:58,981
Well, you know, for instance...

66
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:02,619
...you have ideas that you
ordinarily wouldn't have.

67
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,845
- What kind of ideas?
- Want to hear one?

68
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:07,045
- Tell me.
- All right.

69
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:10,192
I have this idea, okay,
for a television show.

70
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:13,089
Some friends of mine
are cable-access producers.

71
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,889
Do you know what that is?

72
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:20,132
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on.

73
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:24,500
I have this idea for a show that lasts
24 hours a day for a year straight.

74
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:25,935
What you do is you get...

75
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:30,476
...365 people from cities
all over the world...

76
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,673
...to do these 24-hour documents
of real time.

77
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:36,477
Capturing life as it's lived.

78
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:40,645
You know, it would start with a guy
waking up in the morning...

79
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,883
...and taking the long shower...

80
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:46,823
...eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee...

81
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,157
...reading the paper...

82
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,423
wait. All those mundane,
boring things...

83
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:53,659
...everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life?

84
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,963
I was going to say,
"The poetry of day-to-day life."

85
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:58,663
You say it your way.
I'll say it my way.

86
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,866
- Think of it like this...
- who's gonna watch?

87
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:05,207
Think about it like this. Why is it
that a dog sleeping in the sun...

88
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:08,073
...is so beautiful?
It is. It's beautiful.

89
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:10,879
But a guy taking money
from a bank machine...

90
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,113
...looks like a complete moron?

91
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:17,522
<i>So it's like a National Geographic
program, but on people.</i>

92
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:18,557
Yeah.

93
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:20,595
What do you think?

94
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:24,666
Yeah, I can see it.
Like, 24 boring hours... Sorry...

95
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:28,326
...and a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after.

96
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,573
Yeah, and that would
be a great episode.

97
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:35,176
People would talk about that episode.

98
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:39,246
You and your friends could
do one in Paris if you wanted.

99
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,250
I don't know. The key, the thing
that haunts me is the distribution.

100
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:48,390
Getting these tapes from town to town
so it would play continuously.

101
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:53,255
Because it would have to play all
the time, or it just wouldn't work.

102
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:55,428
Thank you.

103
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:58,058
Thanks.

104
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:02,738
You know what?
Not service oriented.

105
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:06,706
Just an observation about Europe.

106
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:17,918
My parents never really
spoke of the possibility...

107
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:21,682
...of my falling in love or
getting married or having children.

108
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:24,024
Even as a little girl...

109
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,686
...they wanted me to think as
a future career as a, you know...

110
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:31,095
...interior designer or lawyer
or something like that.

111
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:34,100
I'd say to my dad,
"I want to be a writer."

112
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,033
And he'd say, "Journalist."

113
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,768
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for
stray cats. He'd say, "Veterinarian."

114
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:44,606
I'd say I wanted to be an actress.
He'd say, "TV newscaster."

115
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:48,807
It was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition into these...

116
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,350
...practical moneymaking ventures.

117
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:56,184
I had a good bullshit detector
when I was a kid.

118
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,884
I always knew
when they were lying to me.

119
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:01,120
By high school, I was dead set...

120
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:05,529
...on listening to what everybody
thought I should do with my life...

121
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:07,533
...and doing the opposite.

122
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,302
Nobody was ever mean about it.
I just could never get very excited...

123
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,673
...about other people's ambitions
for my life.

124
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,911
But you know what?
If your parents never...

125
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:23,779
...fully contradict you about anything
and are nice and supportive...

126
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:24,975
Right.

127
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:28,286
...it makes it even harder
to officially complain.

128
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:32,360
Even when they're wrong,
it's this passive-aggressive shit.

129
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:33,961
You know what I mean?

130
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:35,426
I hate it.

131
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,424
I really hate it.

132
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:41,433
Well, you know, despite all that
kind of bullshit...

133
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,298
...that comes along with it...

134
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:46,672
...I remember childhood as...

135
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:49,568
...this magical time.

136
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,716
I do. I remember when my mother
first told me about death.

137
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:59,683
My great-grandmother had died, and my
family had visited them in Florida.

138
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,948
I was about 3, 3 1/2 years old.

139
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:05,592
Anyway, I was in
the back yard playing...

140
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:09,390
...and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose...

141
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
...and do it in such a way that...

142
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:15,730
...it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow.

143
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,105
And so I was doing that...

144
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:22,471
...and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

145
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:25,977
And she was just standing there,
smiling at me.

146
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:29,346
And I held it there for a long time...

147
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,350
...and I looked at her.

148
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:34,820
And then finally, I let go
of the nozzle, you know?

149
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,993
And then I dropped the hose...

150
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:38,921
...and she disappeared.

151
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,491
And so I run back inside
and tell my parents.

152
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:47,201
And they sit me down
and give me this big rap on how...

153
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:52,498
...when people die, you never see
them again, and how I'd imagined it.

154
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:55,234
But I knew what I'd seen.
I was glad I saw that.

155
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:59,404
I've never seen anything
like that since. But I don't know.

156
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:03,677
It just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

157
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:05,320
Even death.

158
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:09,988
You're lucky you can have
this attitude toward death.

159
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:14,860
I think I'm afraid of death
24 hours a day.

160
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,500
I swear. I mean, that's why
I'm in a train right now.

161
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,364
I could've flown to Paris,
but I'm scared.

162
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:23,870
- Oh, come on.
- I can't help it.

163
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:27,475
I know the statistics say,
"Na, na, na, it's safer." whatever.

164
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:30,806
When I'm in a plane,
I can see the explosion.

165
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,312
I can see me falling
through the clouds.

166
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:37,783
And I'm so scared of those
few seconds of consciousness...

167
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:41,389
...before you die.
When you know you're gonna die.

168
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,592
I can't stop thinking that way.

169
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:48,230
It's exhausting.

170
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:49,990
Yeah, I bet.

171
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,996
Really exhausting.

172
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:58,373
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

173
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:02,408
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah, what a drag.

174
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,316
I wish I'd met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

175
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:08,847
Yeah, me too.

176
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,780
It was really nice of you too.

177
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,885
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this...

178
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,115
...it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

179
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:50,053
What?

180
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,028
I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is...

181
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:00,969
...but I feel like we have
some kind of...

182
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:02,604
...connection. Right?

183
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:03,965
Yeah. Me too.

184
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,206
Right. Great.
Here's the deal.

185
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:09,811
Get off here in Vienna
and come check out the town.

186
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:11,673
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun.

187
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,811
- Come on.
- What would we do?

188
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:18,613
I don't know. All I know is I catch
a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

189
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:22,188
...and I can't afford a hotel,
so I was going to walk around...

190
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,256
...and it'd be more fun
if you came with me.

191
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:28,192
And if I turn out to be a psycho,
just get on the next train.

192
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:31,629
All right, all right.
Think of it like this.

193
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,730
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

194
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:37,099
And you're married.

195
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:41,140
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy it used to have.

196
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,341
You start to blame your husband.

197
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:46,481
You think about all those guys
you've met in your life...

198
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:50,346
...and what might've happened
if you'd picked up with one of them.

199
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:52,544
I'm one of those guys.
That's me.

200
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:54,620
So think of this as time travel...

201
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:58,760
...from then to now to find out
what you're missing out on.

202
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,259
What this could be is
a gigantic favor...

203
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:05,094
...to you and your husband to find out
you're not missing anything.

204
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:08,293
I'm just as big a loser as he is.
Unmotivated. Boring.

205
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:11,133
You made the right choice.
You're happy.

206
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,476
Let me get my bag.

207
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:48,274
We should get a locker for all this.

208
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,509
What's your name?

209
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:55,844
My name?

210
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:59,580
Jesse. James, actually,
but everybody calls me Jesse.

211
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,951
You mean, Jesse James, no?

212
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:03,456
No. No, just Jesse.

213
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,683
I'm Celine.

214
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,836
This is a nice bridge.

215
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:22,306
Yeah.

216
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,241
This is kind of weird.

217
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:31,182
Isn't it? I mean,
I feel a little awkward.

218
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:35,186
- But it's all right. Right?
- Yeah, this is great.

219
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:39,157
- Let's go to some places.
- Yeah, let's go to some places.

220
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,852
- Let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

221
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:43,430
Excuse me. Excuse me?

222
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:45,362
<i>Sprechen sie English?</i>

223
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:49,027
<i>- Ja. Of course.
- Do you speak German for a change?</i>

224
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,036
- What?
- No, it was a joke.

225
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,040
We just got into Vienna today, and
we're looking for something fun to do.

226
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:56,973
Like museums, exhibitions...

227
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,615
But museums are not that
funny anymore these days.

228
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:05,116
They are closing right now.
How long are you going to be here?

229
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:06,516
Just for tonight.

230
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,858
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

231
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,059
We're on honeymoon.

232
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:17,355
Yeah, she got pregnant,
we had to get married...

233
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:20,035
I don't believe you.
You're a bad liar.

234
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,911
This is a play we're both in.
We would like to invite you.

235
00:18:30,113 --> 00:18:31,410
You're actors?

236
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:33,809
Not professional.
Part-time for fun.

237
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:37,144
It's a play about a cow and
Indians searching for it.

238
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:39,913
There are also
politicians, Mexicans...

239
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,057
Russians, communists...

240
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:46,221
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, an actor in a cow costume.

241
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,328
- He's the cow.
- Yes, I am the cow.

242
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:51,660
- And the cow's a bit weird.
- The cow has a disease.

243
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,268
She's acting a bit strange.
Like a dog.

244
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:57,098
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it.

245
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:00,538
And she can smoke with hoofs
and everything.

246
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:03,567
- Great.
- As you see, there is the address.

247
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,509
It's in the second district.

248
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,307
Near the Prater. You know it?

249
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:10,451
The big Ferris wheel?
We should go. We should.

250
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:13,179
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play.

251
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,222
It starts at 2130.

252
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,719
- 2130?
- It's at 9:30.

253
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,953
- 9:30.
- Oh, right.

254
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,892
What's the name of this play?

255
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:27,194
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns
of Wilmingtons Cow."

256
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:28,496
I'm wilmington's cow.

257
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:30,471
- All right.
- Great.

258
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:31,766
- You'll be there?
- We'll try.

259
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,771
I'm the cow.

260
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:34,977
Goodbye.

261
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:58,028
I got an idea. Are you ready?

262
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,896
It's Q and A time.
We've known each other a little while.

263
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:05,096
We're stuck together, so we'll ask
each other a few direct questions.

264
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,432
All right?

265
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,711
- We ask each other questions?
- And you have to answer honestly.

266
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:12,676
- Of course.
- Okay.

267
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:14,680
All right, first question.

268
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:17,079
- You.
- Yes, I am going to ask you.

269
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:21,018
Describe for me your
first sexual feelings...

270
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:23,317
...towards a person.

271
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:26,559
My first sexual feelings?
Oh, my God.

272
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:30,527
I know. I know.

273
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,461
Jean-Marc Fleury.

274
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:34,829
Jean-Marc Fleury?

275
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:39,070
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

276
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:42,677
He had bleached-out
chlorine hair and green eyes...

277
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:46,144
...and to improve his times,
he'd shave his legs and arms.

278
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:49,785
- That's disgusting.
- He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

279
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:52,215
My friend Emma
had a big crush on him.

280
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:55,857
So one day, I was cutting across
the field back to my room...

281
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,788
...and he came walking up beside me.
I told him...

282
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:02,395
..."You should date Emma.
She has a big crush on you."

283
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:04,156
And he turned to me and said...

284
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:08,234
..."well, that's too bad, because
I have a big crush on you."

285
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:11,601
So, yeah, it really scared
the hell out of me...

286
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,002
...because I thought he was so fine.

287
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:19,181
Then he officially asked me on a date.
I pretended I didn't like him.

288
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:24,720
You know, I was so afraid of
what I might do, you know.

289
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,825
So I went to see him swim
a few times at the competition.

290
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:33,051
And he was so sexy. Really.
I mean, really sexy.

291
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:37,757
We wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer...

292
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:41,368
...and, you know, promised we would
keep writing forever...

293
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,835
...and meet again very soon and...

294
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,097
Did you?

295
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:46,806
Of course not.

296
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:51,873
Then this is the opportune time
to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

297
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:53,679
- Really?
- Yeah.

298
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,916
- I make note of that.
- Okay.

299
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,587
- So it's my turn. No?
- Yes, your turn.

300
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:01,017
Hit me.

301
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,722
Have you ever been in love?

302
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:07,493
Yes.

303
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:08,823
Next question.

304
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:11,089
- What was the...
- wait a minute.

305
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,666
- So I can give one-word answers?
- Why not?

306
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,737
After I went into detail
about my sexual feelings?

307
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,400
They're different questions. I could
answer the sexual-feelings thing.

308
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:25,307
But, you know, love... I mean,
what if I asked you about love?

309
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:29,280
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

310
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:32,079
Love is a complex issue, you know?

311
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:37,020
I mean, yes, I've told somebody
that I love them, and I've meant it.

312
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:40,458
But was it totally unselfish,
giving love?

313
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,563
Was it a beautiful thing?

314
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:45,826
Not really.
You know, it's like, love...

315
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:48,232
I mean, I don't know.

316
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:49,804
You know?

317
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:54,568
- Yeah. I know what you mean.
- But as far as sexual feelings go...

318
00:22:54,778 --> 00:22:57,644
...it started with
an obsessive relationship...

319
00:22:57,846 --> 00:23:00,873
<i>...with Miss July, 1978.
Do you know Playboy magazine?</i>

320
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:03,415
- I've heard of it.
- You know Crystal?

321
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,345
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

322
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:10,184
Is it my turn now?

323
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,085
Tell me something that
really pisses you off.

324
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:15,855
- Really drives you crazy.
- Pisses me off.

325
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:18,829
- God, everything pisses me off.
- List a couple.

326
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:23,403
Oh, I know. I hate being told
by strange men...

327
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:25,471
...strange men in the street...

328
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:30,476
...you know, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

329
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:32,105
What else?

330
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:33,645
I hate...

331
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:37,342
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,
there's a war...

332
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:39,749
...people are dying,
and nobody knows what to do.

333
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:42,253
Or they don't give a shit.
I don't know.

334
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:46,087
I hate that the media's
trying to control our minds.

335
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:47,923
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

336
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:51,657
It's very subtle, but it's
a new form of fascism, really.

337
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:54,695
I hate...

338
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:59,132
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America...

339
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:03,903
...each time I wear black or lose my
temper or say anything about anything...

340
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:07,378
...they always go,
"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

341
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:10,951
I hate that.
I can't stand that. Really.

342
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:13,078
Is that all?

343
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,846
Well, there's a lot of things, but...

344
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:18,527
- So it's my turn.
- Okay.

345
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:21,057
- You're gonna answer.
- Yes, I'll answer.

346
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:22,992
What's a problem for you?

347
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:25,030
You, probably.

348
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,289
What?

349
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:30,036
I had a thought the other day
that kind of...

350
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,037
...qualifies as a problem.

351
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:33,365
What is it?

352
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:36,545
It was a thought I had
on the train, so...

353
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:38,406
Okay. All right.

354
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:40,479
Do you believe in reincarnation?

355
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:42,708
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

356
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:47,150
A lot of people talk about past
lives and things like that, you know?

357
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:50,815
And even if they don't believe in it
in some specific way...

358
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:53,325
...people have a notion
of an eternal soul.

359
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,427
- Yeah.
- Okay.

360
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,122
This is my thought:
50,000 years ago...

361
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,300
...there's not even a million people.

362
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:03,336
Ten thousand years ago,
there's, like, two million people.

363
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,499
Now there's between five and six
billion people on the planet.

364
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,233
If we all have our own...

365
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:11,345
...individual, unique...

366
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:12,511
...soul...

367
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:14,746
...where did they all come from?

368
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:18,546
Are modern souls only
a fraction of the original souls?

369
00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:22,748
If they are, that represents
a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

370
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:26,690
...in the last 50,000 years, which is
a blip in the Earth's time.

371
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:30,161
So at best, we're these
tiny fractions...

372
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:31,829
...of people walking...

373
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:36,368
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're so specialized?

374
00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:38,131
Wait a minute, I'm not sure...

375
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,798
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's a totally scattered thought.

376
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:44,939
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

377
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,311
I agree with you.

378
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,451
Let's get off this damn train.

379
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:27,849
This place is pretty neat.

380
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:29,046
Yeah.

381
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,590
There's even a listening booth.

382
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:37,661
Have you heard of this singer?

383
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:41,732
I think she's American.
A friend told me about her.

384
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:45,270
Do you want to go see if that
listening booth still works?

385
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:46,669
Yeah, okay.

386
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:28,976
<i>There's a wind that
Blows in from the north</i>

387
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:34,019
<i>And it says that loving
Takes this course</i>

388
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,015
<i>Come here</i>

389
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,819
<i>Come here</i>

390
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:48,032
<i>No, I'm not impossible to touch</i>

391
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:53,105
<i>I have never wanted you so much</i>

392
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:56,237
<i>Come here</i>

393
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:00,278
<i>Come here</i>

394
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:06,654
<i>Have I never laid down by your side</i>

395
00:28:07,723 --> 00:28:12,525
<i>Baby, let's forget about this pride</i>

396
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,691
<i>Come here</i>

397
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,863
<i>Come here</i>

398
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:28,575
Look at this. This is beautiful.

399
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:37,308
Quick. It's leaving.

400
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:03,468
Look, there's a rabbit.

401
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:05,078
Yeah.

402
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:07,704
Hey there, rabbit.

403
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,282
It's so cute.

404
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:15,288
I visited this as a young teenager.

405
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:19,958
It left a bigger impression on me
at that time than the museums.

406
00:29:20,163 --> 00:29:21,960
Yeah? It's tiny.

407
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:23,257
I know.

408
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:26,962
A little old man talked to us.
He was the groundskeeper.

409
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,002
He explained that most
of the people buried here...

410
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:32,730
...had washed up on the bank
of the Danube.

411
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:35,710
How old are these?

412
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:39,978
Around the beginning of the century.
It's called No Name Cemetery...

413
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:42,777
...because they often didn't know
who those people were.

414
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:45,077
Maybe a first name, that's all.

415
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:47,320
Why were all the bodies washing up?

416
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:51,459
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

417
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:54,960
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

418
00:29:56,965 --> 00:30:00,696
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

419
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,961
When I was a little girl,
I thought...

420
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:05,696
...if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead...

421
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:07,875
...then it's like
not really being dead.

422
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:10,978
People can invent the best
and the worst for you.

423
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:16,542
Here she is, I think.

424
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:20,185
Yeah, this is the one
I remember the most.

425
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,752
She was only 13 when she died.

426
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:30,565
That meant something to me.
I was that age when I first saw this.

427
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:39,837
Now I'm 10 years older,
and she's still 13, I guess.

428
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,135
That's funny.

429
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:04,490
That's the Danube over there.

430
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,662
That's a river, right?

431
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:07,892
Yeah.

432
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,435
This is...

433
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:19,077
...gorgeous.

434
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:22,209
Yeah, this is beautiful.

435
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,684
I mean, we got...

436
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:31,583
we got a sunset here.

437
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:34,894
- Yeah.
- We got the Ferris wheel.

438
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:38,796
It seems like...

439
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:41,092
...this would be a...

440
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:44,037
what?

441
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:49,502
You know...

442
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:57,116
Are you trying to say
you want to kiss me?

443
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:07,411
But you know what?

444
00:33:07,623 --> 00:33:10,557
It doesn't matter what
generation you're born into.

445
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,021
Look at my parents.

446
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:16,425
They were angry, young May '68 people
revolting against everything.

447
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:20,397
The government, their conservative
Catholic backgrounds...

448
00:33:20,603 --> 00:33:24,095
Then I was born, and my father
became a successful architect.

449
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:27,332
We traveled around the world
while he built bridges...

450
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,772
...and, you know, towers and stuff.

451
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:32,844
I mean, I really can't
complain about anything.

452
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:35,039
They love me more than anything...

453
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,413
...and I've been raised with all
the freedom they fought for.

454
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:41,646
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

455
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:45,190
We have to deal with the same shit,
but we can't really know...

456
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:47,884
...who or, you know, what the enemy is.

457
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:50,930
I don't know if
there really is an enemy.

458
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,192
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

459
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:56,859
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.
Poor kids', not enough.

460
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,439
Too much attention,
not enough attention.

461
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:02,873
They either left or
taught them the wrong things.

462
00:34:03,078 --> 00:34:06,878
My parents are just two people
who didn't like each other much...

463
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,947
...who got married and had a kid.

464
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,483
And they tried their best
to be nice to me.

465
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:15,655
- Did your parents divorce?
- Yeah, finally.

466
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:18,088
They should have done it sooner.
They stuck together...

467
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:21,956
...for the well-being of my sister
and I. Thank you very much.

468
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:25,699
I remember my mother told me
right in front of my father...

469
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,425
...that he didn't really
want to have me.

470
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:31,936
That he was pissed off when
he found out she was pregnant.

471
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:35,769
That I was a big mistake.
That really shaped the way I think.

472
00:34:35,978 --> 00:34:40,244
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

473
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,438
That's so sad.

474
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,813
Well, I mean, I eventually
kind of took pride in it.

475
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,510
You know, like my life
was my own doing.

476
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:50,851
You know, like I was
crashing the big party.

477
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,085
That's the way to see it.

478
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:56,661
My parents are still married
and I guess they're happy.

479
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:01,795
But I think it's healthy to rebel
against everything that came before.

480
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,505
You know, I've been wondering lately...

481
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:12,713
...do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

482
00:35:14,382 --> 00:35:17,375
Yeah, sure. You know,
I know happy couples.

483
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:20,213
But I think they lie to each other.

484
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,184
Yeah.

485
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,251
People can live their
whole life as a lie.

486
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,360
My grandmother was married...

487
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:30,657
...and I thought she had an
uncomplicated love life.

488
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:34,893
But she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life...

489
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:38,164
...dreaming about another man
she was in love with.

490
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:41,704
She just accepted her fate.
It's so sad.

491
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:45,041
In the same time, I love that
she had these emotions...

492
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:47,579
...and feelings I never
thought she had.

493
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:50,012
I guarantee you
it was better that way.

494
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:53,585
If she'd known him, he'd have
disappointed her eventually.

495
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:56,155
- How do you know?
- I know. I know.

496
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:58,918
People put romantic projections
on everything.

497
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:01,824
It's not based in any kind of reality.

498
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,728
Romantic projections?
Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

499
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:09,233
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.
Oh, it's so beautiful."

500
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:12,929
Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

501
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,588
Check these guys out.

502
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:37,289
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not
wearing underwear underneath this."

503
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:40,161
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

504
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,007
Can I tell you a secret?

505
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:49,400
Yeah.

506
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:50,737
Come here.

507
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,547
- What?
- Come here.

508
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:09,586
Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting looking.

509
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:10,822
Yeah.

510
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,733
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

511
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:15,693
- I made eye contact.
- She's not coming over here.

512
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:17,896
- Yes, she is.
- Oh, shit.

513
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:22,235
Oh, no.

514
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,501
- You want your palm read?
- No.

515
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:26,873
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

516
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:28,572
- Okay.
- Hello.

517
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,481
Oh, here she is.

518
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:42,663
I want your palm read.

519
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,963
Yeah. How much is it?

520
00:37:47,402 --> 00:37:48,893
For you, 50.

521
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:50,262
Okay?

522
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,606
Okay.

523
00:37:58,213 --> 00:38:01,181
So you have been on a journey...

524
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:03,351
...and you're a stranger
to this place.

525
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,021
You are...

526
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,778
...an adventurer.

527
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:09,815
A seeker.

528
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:12,849
An adventurer in your mind.

529
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,099
You are interested
in the power of the woman.

530
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:26,206
In the woman's deep strength
and creativity.

531
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:28,940
You're becoming this woman.

532
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:38,585
You need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

533
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,655
Only if you find peace
within yourself...

534
00:38:43,324 --> 00:38:46,885
...will you find
true connection with others.

535
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:51,865
That is a stranger to you?

536
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:54,032
I guess so.

537
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:02,469
You will be all right.
He's learning.

538
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:04,266
Okay.

539
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,811
Money.

540
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:15,556
You're both stars.

541
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:17,315
Don't forget.

542
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:20,853
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago...

543
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:23,860
...they formed everything
that is this world.

544
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:26,932
Everything we know is stardust.

545
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:31,072
So don't forget, you are stardust.

546
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:37,538
That's very nice and all.

547
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:40,077
I mean, that we're all stardust...

548
00:39:40,282 --> 00:39:42,715
...and you're becoming this great woman.

549
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:45,809
But I hope you don't take that
any more seriously...

550
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,148
...than some horoscope
in a newspaper.

551
00:39:48,356 --> 00:39:52,623
What? She knew I was on vacation
and that we didn't know each other...

552
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:55,728
...and that I was going
to become this great woman.

553
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:58,297
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

554
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,831
That's way condescending, you know?

555
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:03,094
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

556
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:07,637
I mean, if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth...

557
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,902
...it would put them
out of business.

558
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:14,708
Just once, I'd love to see some
little old lady save up all her money...

559
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:19,581
...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd
get there and the woman would say...

560
00:40:21,623 --> 00:40:24,717
..."Tomorrow and all
your remaining days...

561
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,952
...will be exactly like today...

562
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:29,686
...a tedious collection of hours.

563
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:33,128
And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts...

564
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:35,735
...and no new travels.

565
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:38,838
And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten.

566
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:41,275
Fifty schillings, please."

567
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:43,206
That I'd like to see.

568
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:45,711
It's so funny how...

569
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:49,440
...she almost didn't notice you.
It's weird. I wonder why.

570
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:53,815
She was really wise and intense.
I really loved what she said.

571
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:57,856
You pay your money to hear what
makes you feel good about yourself.

572
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,552
Maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna.
We can buy a hit of crack.

573
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:03,286
Would you like that?

574
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,623
You're so...

575
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:08,927
Stardust. Stardust.

576
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,143
There's an exhibition.

577
00:41:21,884 --> 00:41:25,217
I guess we'll miss it.
It doesn't start until next week.

578
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,621
Yeah, I think so.

579
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:32,657
I actually saw this one in a museum.

580
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,896
I stared and stared at it.

581
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:38,396
Must have been 45 minutes.

582
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:40,226
I love it.

583
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:43,536
<i>La voie ferrée.
It's great.</i>

584
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:48,902
I love the way the people are
dissolving into the background.

585
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:51,244
Look at this.

586
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,505
It's like the environments...

587
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:57,110
...are stronger than the people.

588
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:01,722
His human figures are
always so transitory.

589
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:03,983
It's funny. Transitory?

590
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:05,960
Transitory.

591
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:28,039
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

592
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:56,206
I was in an old church like this...

593
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:59,539
...with my grandmother
a few days ago in Budapest.

594
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,483
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing...

595
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,778
...I can't help but feeling for
those people that come here...

596
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,255
...lost or in pain, guilt...

597
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:15,327
...looking for some kind of answers.

598
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:20,494
It fascinates me how a single place
can join pain and happiness...

599
00:43:20,702 --> 00:43:23,034
...of so many generations.

600
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,731
You're close with your grandmother?

601
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:28,567
Yeah.

602
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:34,675
I think it's because I always
have this strange feeling...

603
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:38,876
...that I'm this very old woman
laying down, about to die.

604
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:42,684
You know, that my life is just...

605
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,719
...her memories or something.

606
00:43:48,396 --> 00:43:50,092
That's so wild.

607
00:43:52,134 --> 00:43:55,728
I always think that I'm still
this 13-year-old boy...

608
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:59,030
...who doesn't really know how
to be an adult, pretending to...

609
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,735
...live my life, taking notes for when
I'll really have to do it.

610
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:07,012
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

611
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:10,940
That's funny.

612
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:14,050
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,
it was like...

613
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:18,317
...this very old woman
kissing this very young boy. Right?

614
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,192
Do you know anything about
the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

615
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:28,693
No, not much.

616
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:32,231
Well, I went to
this Quaker wedding once...

617
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,306
...and it was fantastic.

618
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:35,802
What they do is...

619
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,277
...the couple comes in and they kneel
in front of the whole congregation...

620
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:42,005
...and they stare at each other.

621
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:47,143
Nobody says a word unless they feel
that God moves them to speak...

622
00:44:47,356 --> 00:44:49,016
...or say something.

623
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,619
And then, after an hour or so of just...

624
00:44:54,096 --> 00:44:55,927
...staring at each other...

625
00:44:56,398 --> 00:44:57,762
...they're married.

626
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:01,760
That's beautiful. I like that.

627
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,043
This is a horrible story.

628
00:45:21,123 --> 00:45:22,112
What?

629
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,056
It's not the appropriate place
to tell it.

630
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,195
Well, I was driving around
with this buddy of mine.

631
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:30,297
He's a big atheist, you know.

632
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:33,365
And he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

633
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:35,864
My buddy takes out a $100 bill...

634
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,469
...and leans out the window...

635
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:40,936
...and he says,
"Do you believe in God?"

636
00:45:41,777 --> 00:45:45,507
And the guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money.

637
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,681
He says...

638
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:49,710
..."Yes, I do."

639
00:45:49,918 --> 00:45:51,851
My friend says, "wrong answer."

640
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:53,543
We drove away.

641
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:55,878
That's mean.

642
00:46:07,168 --> 00:46:11,003
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train?

643
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:13,134
No, not yet.

644
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,503
What would you be doing?

645
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,371
I'd probably be hanging around
the airport...

646
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:21,947
...crying in my coffee
because you didn't come with me.

647
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:29,820
I'd probably gotten off the train
in Salzburg with someone else.

648
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:31,992
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

649
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:34,094
So I'm just a dumb American...

650
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:38,425
...momentarily decorating
your blank canvas, huh?

651
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,795
- I'm having a great time.
- Really?

652
00:46:42,003 --> 00:46:43,231
Me too.

653
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,007
I'm glad, because
no one knows I'm here.

654
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,199
I don't know anyone
that would tell me...

655
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:51,503
...all those bad things you've done.

656
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:54,045
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

657
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,043
You hear so much shit about people.
I always feel like...

658
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:01,653
...the general of an army
when I start dating.

659
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:03,949
Plotting my strategy
and maneuverings...

660
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,686
...knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

661
00:47:07,996 --> 00:47:09,429
It's horrible.

662
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:15,498
If we were always around each other...

663
00:47:15,704 --> 00:47:19,503
...what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad?

664
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:23,210
No. I'm not going to
answer this question.

665
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:26,505
I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

666
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:28,306
"What about me bugs you?"

667
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:32,213
Finally I said, "I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

668
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,514
She flew into a rage and
broke up with me. That's true.

669
00:47:35,724 --> 00:47:37,851
All she wanted was
to have an excuse...

670
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,755
...to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me.

671
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,190
Is that what you want?

672
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:44,126
Something about me bugs you?

673
00:47:44,632 --> 00:47:47,534
- What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

674
00:47:47,735 --> 00:47:50,204
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

675
00:47:50,572 --> 00:47:54,063
If it had to be something,
if I had to think about it...

676
00:47:54,275 --> 00:47:57,871
...I kind of didn't really like this
reaction at the palm reader.

677
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,445
You were like this rooster prick.

678
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:02,514
What the hell
is a rooster prick?

679
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:04,206
You were like a boy whining...

680
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:07,081
...because all the attention
wasn't focused on him.

681
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:10,382
All right, listen.
This woman robs you blind, okay?

682
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,923
You were like a boy
walking by an ice-cream store...

683
00:48:13,128 --> 00:48:15,891
...crying because his mom
won't buy him a milk shake.

684
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:19,157
I don't care what this charlatan
has to say about...

685
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,494
what?

686
00:48:25,407 --> 00:48:27,840
I understand a little,
but he doesn't at all.

687
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:33,403
May I ask you a question?

688
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,650
So I would like to
make a deal with you.

689
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:44,753
I mean, instead of just asking you
for money, I will ask you for a word.

690
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,559
You give me a word, I take the word,
and then I will write a poem...

691
00:48:49,797 --> 00:48:51,264
...with the word inside.

692
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,967
And if you like it,
if you like my poem...

693
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:57,929
...if it adds something to
your life in any way...

694
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:00,766
...then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

695
00:49:01,443 --> 00:49:03,434
I'll write in English, of course.

696
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,373
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

697
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,041
So?

698
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,449
Pick a word.

699
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:16,414
A word.

700
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,222
- Milk shake.
- Milk shake? Oh, good.

701
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:23,329
I was gonna say "rooster prick."
But great. Milk shake.

702
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,963
"Milk shake"?

703
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,297
Okay, milk shake.

704
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:29,960
- All right, so...
- Good.

705
00:49:41,016 --> 00:49:45,248
I gotta say, I like this
Viennese variation of bum.

706
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:48,547
I like what he said about
adding something to your life.

707
00:49:48,757 --> 00:49:52,556
So, were we having
our first fight back there?

708
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,088
I think so. I think we were.

709
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:59,891
Even if we were, why does everyone
think conflict is so bad?

710
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:02,934
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

711
00:50:03,137 --> 00:50:04,867
Yeah, I guess so.

712
00:50:05,273 --> 00:50:08,503
I always think if I could
just accept the fact...

713
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,646
...that my life was supposed to be
difficult, that's what's expected...

714
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:14,677
...then I might not get so pissed off.

715
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:17,681
And I'd just be glad
when something nice happens.

716
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:19,385
That's why I'm still in school.

717
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:22,077
It's easier to have
something to fight against.

718
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:26,021
Well, we've all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us.

719
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,588
You know, I can be doing
the most nothing thing.

720
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:32,130
Throwing some darts
or shooting some pool.

721
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,166
Then all of a sudden,
I feel it come over me.

722
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,599
I have got to win.

723
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:41,264
Is that why you tried to get me
off the train? Competitiveness?

724
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:42,806
What do you mean?

725
00:50:44,713 --> 00:50:45,907
I got a poem.

726
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,838
Oh, all right.

727
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,211
Will you read it to us?

728
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:56,255
Sure. Okay.

729
00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:02,228
"Daydream delusion

730
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:04,664
Limousine eyelash

731
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,898
Oh, baby, with your pretty face

732
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:13,139
Drop a tear in my wine glass
Look at those big eyes

733
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:15,534
See what you mean to me

734
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:18,744
Sweetcakes and milk shakes

735
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:21,208
I am a delusion angel

736
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,943
I'm a fantasy parade

737
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:28,387
I want you to know what I think
Don't want you to guess anymore

738
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,989
You have no idea where I came from

739
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:33,259
we have no idea where we're going

740
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:35,324
Lodged in life

741
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,088
Like branches in the river

742
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:40,233
Flowing downstream
Caught in the current

743
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:41,992
I carry you

744
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:43,760
You'll carry me

745
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:46,201
That's how it could be

746
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:49,068
Don't you know me?

747
00:51:50,043 --> 00:51:51,875
Don't you know me by now?"

748
00:51:53,114 --> 00:51:54,307
Great.

749
00:51:54,983 --> 00:51:57,213
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

750
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:02,050
Here you go.

751
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:05,552
- Thanks.
- All right.

752
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,954
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

753
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:09,061
Good luck.

754
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:27,041
It was wonderful, no?

755
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:34,380
- What?
- He probably didn't just write that.

756
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:37,251
He wrote it, but he
probably plugs that word in.

757
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,722
You know, whatever, "milk shake."

758
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:41,519
What do you mean?

759
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:43,923
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

760
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:54,197
You know what drives me crazy?
People talking about...

761
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:57,105
...how great technology is,
how it saves all this time.

762
00:52:57,311 --> 00:53:00,304
But what good is saved time
if nobody uses it?

763
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:02,847
If it just turns into more busy work.

764
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:07,487
I never hear anybody say, "with the time
I've saved using my word processor...

765
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:10,590
...Im gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

766
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,951
- You don't hear that.
- Time is so abstract anyway.

767
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:16,789
- Are you looking at this girl?
- What?

768
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:18,362
Nothing.

769
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,432
You wanna go in here?

770
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:24,092
- You wanna go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

771
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:27,195
Wanna go?

772
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:28,500
Hello.

773
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:32,208
Fifty schillings.

774
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:35,313
- Each.
- I got 100. Here, I got it.

775
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,311
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

776
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,530
- You gonna buy me a beer?
- Yeah.

777
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,135
You think Old Milwaukee
is expensive here?

778
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:06,836
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

779
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:11,409
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

780
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:14,409
- No, not right now.
- But you did.

781
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:17,512
We broke up six months ago.

782
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:20,210
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

783
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,150
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
Tell me about it.

784
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,123
No way. I can't.
It's really, really boring.

785
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:29,295
Come on. Tell me about it.

786
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:33,329
I was really disappointed.

787
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:36,559
I thought this one would last
for a while. He was...

788
00:55:37,005 --> 00:55:40,838
...very stupid, ugly,
bad in bed, alcoholic...

789
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:44,336
- You know.
- A real prize winner.

790
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,380
I was kind of giving him a favor.

791
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:50,346
But he left me,
saying I loved him too much.

792
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,284
I was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that.

793
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:58,617
But anyway, I was traumatized
and became...

794
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:01,456
And became totally obsessed with him.

795
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:05,090
So I went to a shrink, and it came up
that I had written...

796
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:09,759
...this stupid story about this
woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

797
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:12,101
...and how she'd do it.

798
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:15,639
It's all the details
of how to do it and not get caught...

799
00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:17,833
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

800
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:24,079
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

801
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:25,547
No, I understand.

802
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:28,585
This stupid shrink believed
everything I told her.

803
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:32,487
It was my first time seeing her.
She said she had to call the police.

804
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:34,592
She had to call the police?

805
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:39,094
She was totally convinced
I was really gonna do it.

806
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,235
Even though I had explained
it was just some writing.

807
00:56:42,436 --> 00:56:45,371
She said, looking into my eyes,
"The way you said it...

808
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:47,438
...I know you are going to do it."

809
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:50,202
She was totally out of her mind.

810
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:53,572
It was my first and last session.

811
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,543
So what happened then?

812
00:56:57,452 --> 00:56:59,510
I totally got over him.

813
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:01,284
But now, I'm obsessed...

814
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:05,983
...that he's gonna die from
an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

815
00:57:06,327 --> 00:57:08,521
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

816
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:13,762
Why is it you become obsessed
with people you don't...

817
00:57:13,967 --> 00:57:15,697
...really like that much?

818
00:57:15,902 --> 00:57:17,268
I don't know.

819
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:20,673
So how about you?

820
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:24,873
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

821
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,547
It's funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long.

822
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:32,514
But now you have to tell me.

823
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,914
Well, I kind of see love...

824
00:57:35,123 --> 00:57:39,355
...as this escape for two people
who don't know how to be alone.

825
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:43,630
It's funny.
People always talk about how...

826
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:46,628
...love is this totally unselfish,
giving thing.

827
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:50,099
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

828
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:52,199
I know.

829
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:54,974
So who just broke up with you?

830
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:58,070
What?

831
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,679
You sound like you just were hurt.

832
00:58:02,884 --> 00:58:04,181
Do I?

833
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:05,713
All right.

834
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:08,320
Big confession.

835
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:11,650
I should've told you this
earlier or something.

836
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,128
I didn't come to Europe just to...

837
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:18,525
...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris
and shit like that.

838
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:22,565
I saved up my money all spring to
fly to Madrid...

839
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:25,329
...and spend the summer
with my girlfriend...

840
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:27,268
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend...

841
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:30,807
...who has been on this art history
program for the last year.

842
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:34,413
Anyway, I got here.
We were reunited at long last...

843
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:38,744
...and we went out to dinner our
first night with six of her friends.

844
00:58:38,952 --> 00:58:41,581
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

845
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,949
...Maria, Suzy from home.

846
00:58:44,157 --> 00:58:47,525
She managed to avoid being alone
with me for the first few days...

847
00:58:47,728 --> 00:58:52,358
...and I stuck around just to let it
sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

848
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:57,900
So I bought the cheapest flight out,
this one leaving out of Vienna.

849
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:01,597
It didn't leave for a couple weeks,
so I bought this Eurail pass.

850
00:59:02,275 --> 00:59:06,405
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

851
00:59:08,315 --> 00:59:11,114
It's when you remember
how little you thought about...

852
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:14,048
...the people you broke up with,
and you realize...

853
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:17,884
...that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

854
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:20,389
You'd like to think
you're both in pain...

855
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:23,586
...but really, they're just,
"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

856
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:26,231
Believe me, I know.

857
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,458
You should look at bright colors.

858
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,036
That's what the shrink told me.

859
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,833
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

860
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,340
...to hear that I
was a homicidal maniac...

861
00:59:37,545 --> 00:59:41,606
...but I could shift my obsession if I
would concentrate on bright colors.

862
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:43,077
Did it work?

863
00:59:46,621 --> 00:59:48,679
- Didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no.

864
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:53,090
Yeah, well, you know,
I haven't killed anyone lately.

865
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:54,625
Not lately?

866
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:56,829
That's good.
You're cured then.

867
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:06,501
There's breeds of monkeys,
and all they do is have sex...

868
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,273
...all the time.

869
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:10,706
And they turn out to be
the least violent...

870
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:13,880
...the most peaceful, the most happy.

871
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:16,572
So maybe fooling around's
not so bad.

872
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:19,911
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I am.

873
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:21,485
- I thought so.
- Why?

874
01:00:21,688 --> 01:00:25,385
I never heard this one.
But it reminds me of this perfect...

875
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:28,027
...male argument to justify them
fooling around.

876
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:31,664
Women monkeys are fooling around too.
Everybody's fooling around.

877
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:37,061
That's cute. I have this awful,
paranoid thought...

878
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:40,467
...that feminism was mostly invented
by men so they could...

879
01:00:40,675 --> 01:00:41,972
...fool around more.

880
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:45,338
"Woman, free your mind,
free your body. Sleep with me.

881
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:50,074
We're all happy and free, as long as
I can fuck as much as I can."

882
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:51,817
All right.

883
01:00:52,018 --> 01:00:55,318
But maybe there's some
biological things at work here.

884
01:00:55,523 --> 01:00:57,047
If you had an island...

885
01:00:57,257 --> 01:01:01,887
...and there were 99 women
on the island and only one man...

886
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:04,893
...in a year, you'd have
the possibility of 99 babies.

887
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:08,398
But if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman...

888
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:13,266
...in a year, you have the possibility
of only one baby. So...

889
01:01:13,574 --> 01:01:14,541
You know what?

890
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:18,905
On this island, I think there
will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

891
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:23,014
They would've killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

892
01:01:23,217 --> 01:01:27,449
And on the other island,
there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

893
01:01:27,655 --> 01:01:29,315
...and no more man.

894
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:32,083
Because they would've all
eaten him alive.

895
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:33,692
Oh, yeah?

896
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:35,623
There's something to that.

897
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:39,994
On some level, women don't mind
the idea of destroying a man.

898
01:01:41,202 --> 01:01:44,068
I was walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend...

899
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:48,764
...and we'd just walked by these four
thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

900
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:52,139
And one of them says,
"Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

901
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:56,009
So I'm like, "No big deal.
I won't get uptight about this."

902
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:57,775
Plus, there were four of them.

903
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,954
Exactly. But she says,
"Fuck you, dickheads!"

904
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:04,351
And I'm like, "Okay.
Wait a minute, here."

905
01:02:04,557 --> 01:02:07,117
They're not gonna come over
and kick her ass.

906
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:10,262
So who just got pushed
to the frontline on that one?

907
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:13,432
Women say they hate it
if you're all protective.

908
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:18,003
But if it suits them, then
they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

909
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:22,335
You know what? I don't think
woman really wants to destroy man.

910
01:02:23,244 --> 01:02:25,610
Even if they want to,
they don't succeed.

911
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:28,007
I'm sure even men are
destroying women...

912
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:31,275
...or are capable of destroying women
much more than women...

913
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:33,782
Anyway, it's depressing.
You know what?

914
01:02:33,987 --> 01:02:36,581
- You wanna stop talking about this?
- I hate it.

915
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:38,349
Men, women, it's...

916
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,050
There's no end to it.

917
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:43,085
It's like a skipping record.

918
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:46,494
Every couple's been having
this conversation forever.

919
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:48,793
And nobody came up with anything.

920
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:07,887
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

921
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:09,554
A birth dance?

922
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,679
Should I give her some money?

923
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:43,188
Everything that's interesting
costs a little money.

924
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,717
So a birth dance, huh?

925
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:49,657
Looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me.

926
01:03:49,864 --> 01:03:52,661
No, but really.
Women used it when giving birth.

927
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:55,266
In part of the world,
they still do it.

928
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:58,972
The woman in labor enters a tent...

929
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:01,766
...and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance.

930
01:04:01,976 --> 01:04:04,273
They encourage her
to dance with them...

931
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:06,775
...so as to make
the birth less painful.

932
01:04:06,981 --> 01:04:10,416
And when the baby is born,
they all dance in celebration.

933
01:04:11,552 --> 01:04:13,815
I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

934
01:04:14,355 --> 01:04:18,552
I like the idea of dancing as something
everybody participates in.

935
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:21,887
I know. I heard about this old guy...

936
01:04:22,096 --> 01:04:24,222
...who was watching
some young people dance.

937
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:25,829
He said, "How beautiful.

938
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:28,967
They're shaking off their genitals
to become angels."

939
01:04:29,168 --> 01:04:30,067
I like that.

940
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:31,465
One question, though.

941
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:35,335
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff...

942
01:04:35,543 --> 01:04:36,635
...where are the men?

943
01:04:36,844 --> 01:04:41,143
Are we out food gathering? Are we not
invited? You all don't need us?

944
01:04:41,347 --> 01:04:43,646
Men are lucky we don't
bite off their heads after mating.

945
01:04:43,851 --> 01:04:46,820
Certain insects do that,
like spiders and stuff?

946
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:49,420
We let you live.
What are you complaining about?

947
01:04:49,623 --> 01:04:53,251
See, you're officially kidding.
But there's something to that.

948
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,586
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

949
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,630
No, no. Wait a minute.
Talking seriously here.

950
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:02,733
I mean, I always feel
this pressure of being...

951
01:05:02,936 --> 01:05:05,565
...a strong and independent
icon of womanhood...

952
01:05:05,773 --> 01:05:07,797
...and not making it look like...

953
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:11,101
...my whole life is revolving
around some guy.

954
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:14,010
But loving someone...

955
01:05:14,213 --> 01:05:17,650
...and being loved
means so much to me.

956
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:20,650
I always make fun of it and stuff...

957
01:05:21,655 --> 01:05:23,679
...but isn't everything
we do in life...

958
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:26,757
...a way to be loved a little more?

959
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,427
I don't know.

960
01:05:32,865 --> 01:05:34,800
Sometimes I dream...

961
01:05:35,001 --> 01:05:38,027
...about being a good father
and a good husband.

962
01:05:38,237 --> 01:05:40,706
And sometimes it feels really close.

963
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,275
But then other times...

964
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:46,369
...it seems silly...

965
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:48,047
...like it would...

966
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:50,211
...ruin my whole life.

967
01:05:50,884 --> 01:05:54,047
And it's not just
a fear of commitment...

968
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:57,382
...or that I'm incapable
of caring or loving because...

969
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,818
...I can.

970
01:05:59,726 --> 01:06:03,856
It's just that, if I'm
totally honest with myself...

971
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,791
...I think I'd rather die knowing...

972
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,525
...that I was
really good at something.

973
01:06:08,735 --> 01:06:11,568
That I had excelled
in some way...

974
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:13,704
...than that I'd just been in...

975
01:06:13,907 --> 01:06:17,206
...a nice, caring relationship.

976
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:26,818
I had worked for this older man,
and once he told me...

977
01:06:27,021 --> 01:06:30,684
...that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career.

978
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:33,188
He was 52,
and it suddenly struck him...

979
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:37,057
...that he had never really
given anything of himself.

980
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:39,831
His life was for no one and nothing.

981
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:43,467
He was almost crying saying that.

982
01:06:46,472 --> 01:06:48,940
I believe if there's
any kind of God...

983
01:06:49,143 --> 01:06:51,134
...it wouldn't be in any of us...

984
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:53,344
...not you or me...

985
01:06:54,114 --> 01:06:57,242
...but just this little space
in between.

986
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:02,280
If there's any kind of magic
in this world...

987
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:06,891
...it must be in the attempt of
understanding someone sharing something.

988
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:12,461
I know, it's almost
impossible to succeed...

989
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,028
...but who cares really?

990
01:07:16,135 --> 01:07:18,570
The answer must be in the attempt.

991
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,805
I think this is a civilization in
decline. Look at the service.

992
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:34,447
Where is the waitress?
In New York, she'd be out of a job.

993
01:08:43,556 --> 01:08:45,717
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

994
01:08:45,893 --> 01:08:49,020
...who I'm supposed to have
lunch with in eight hours.

995
01:08:57,237 --> 01:08:58,465
Pick up.

996
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:00,605
- Pick up the phone.
- All right.

997
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:17,555
I've been working on my English.
You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

998
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,390
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

999
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:25,621
I don't think I'll be able to
make it for lunch today.

1000
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:31,033
I met a guy on the train,
and I got off with him in Vienna.

1001
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,261
Are you crazy?

1002
01:09:34,307 --> 01:09:35,707
Probably.

1003
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:39,202
- He's Austrian? He's from there?
- No, No.

1004
01:09:39,412 --> 01:09:43,109
He's passing through. He's American.
He's going back home tomorrow.

1005
01:09:43,317 --> 01:09:44,681
Why'd you get off?

1006
01:09:45,886 --> 01:09:48,319
Well, he convinced me.

1007
01:09:49,256 --> 01:09:53,021
I mean, actually, I was ready to
get off the train with him...

1008
01:09:53,226 --> 01:09:55,194
...after talking to him a short while.

1009
01:09:55,395 --> 01:09:57,420
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1010
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:01,265
In the lounge car,
he began to talk about...

1011
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:04,561
...him as a boy seeing
his great-grandmother's ghost.

1012
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:08,168
I think that's when I fell for him.

1013
01:10:09,275 --> 01:10:13,109
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

1014
01:10:14,581 --> 01:10:16,207
He trapped me.

1015
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:21,113
And he's so cute.

1016
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,481
He has beautiful blue eyes...

1017
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:25,680
...nice pink lips...

1018
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:28,118
...greasy hair.

1019
01:10:28,828 --> 01:10:30,421
I love it.

1020
01:10:30,796 --> 01:10:33,630
He's kind of tall,
and he's a little clumsy.

1021
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:37,735
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

1022
01:10:42,442 --> 01:10:45,536
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

1023
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:49,306
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

1024
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,344
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

1025
01:10:55,188 --> 01:10:56,814
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1026
01:10:57,024 --> 01:11:00,983
I told him the story about
the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

1027
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:02,962
He must be scared to death.

1028
01:11:03,162 --> 01:11:06,427
He must be thinking I'm
this manipulative, mean woman.

1029
01:11:08,702 --> 01:11:11,193
I just hope he doesn't feel
that way about me.

1030
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:14,373
Because, you know me,
I'm the most harmless person.

1031
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:18,777
The only person I could
really hurt is myself.

1032
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,579
I don't think he's scared of you.

1033
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:23,613
I think he's crazy about you.

1034
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:26,344
- Really?
- I've known you a long time.

1035
01:11:26,552 --> 01:11:29,020
I got a good feeling.
You gonna see him again?

1036
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,225
We haven't talked about that yet.

1037
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:41,595
Okay, it's your turn.
You call your friend.

1038
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:43,702
All right, all right.

1039
01:11:47,106 --> 01:11:49,631
I usually get this guy's
answering machine.

1040
01:11:52,345 --> 01:11:53,972
Hi, dude. What's up?

1041
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:58,748
Hey, Frank. How you been?
I'm glad you're home.

1042
01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:00,385
Cool. Yeah.

1043
01:12:00,587 --> 01:12:02,145
So how was Madrid?

1044
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:04,916
Madrid sucked.

1045
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:08,253
Lisa and I had our
long overdue meltdown.

1046
01:12:08,795 --> 01:12:10,694
Too bad. I told you, no?

1047
01:12:10,896 --> 01:12:14,060
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing
just never works.

1048
01:12:14,266 --> 01:12:16,292
I was only in Madrid
for a couple days.

1049
01:12:16,502 --> 01:12:19,164
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

1050
01:12:21,173 --> 01:12:24,404
You know, it really wasn't
that much cheaper. I just...

1051
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:28,842
I couldn't go home right away.
I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1052
01:12:29,048 --> 01:12:31,813
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

1053
01:12:33,487 --> 01:12:34,818
So are you okay now?

1054
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:38,047
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.
That's the thing.

1055
01:12:38,658 --> 01:12:39,625
I'm rapturous.

1056
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:41,817
And I'll tell you why.

1057
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:44,930
I met somebody
on my last night in Europe.

1058
01:12:45,131 --> 01:12:47,828
- That's incredible.
- I know, I know.

1059
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:51,402
You know how they say we're all
each other's demons and angels?

1060
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:55,805
Well, she was literally
a Botticelli angel...

1061
01:12:56,609 --> 01:12:58,635
...telling me everything
would be okay.

1062
01:13:01,648 --> 01:13:02,807
How did you meet?

1063
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:05,885
On the train.

1064
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:09,515
She was sitting next to
a weird couple that was fighting...

1065
01:13:09,722 --> 01:13:12,886
...so she moved. She sat
right across the aisle from me.

1066
01:13:13,092 --> 01:13:15,027
So we started to talk.

1067
01:13:15,228 --> 01:13:17,422
She didn't like me much at first.

1068
01:13:17,631 --> 01:13:18,791
She's super smart...

1069
01:13:19,466 --> 01:13:21,695
...very passionate...

1070
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:23,462
...and beautiful.

1071
01:13:25,005 --> 01:13:27,496
And I was so unsure of myself.

1072
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,537
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

1073
01:13:32,412 --> 01:13:35,438
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

1074
01:13:36,048 --> 01:13:38,313
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1075
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:41,117
No, and by the way,
she sat next to you.

1076
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,050
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1077
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:44,587
Oh, yeah?

1078
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,161
Us men are so stupid. We don't
understand anything about women.

1079
01:13:53,432 --> 01:13:55,923
They act strange,
the little I know of them.

1080
01:13:56,536 --> 01:13:57,832
Don't they?

1081
01:14:04,877 --> 01:14:08,779
I feel like this is
some dream world we're in.

1082
01:14:08,981 --> 01:14:10,573
Yeah, it's so weird.

1083
01:14:10,984 --> 01:14:13,179
It's like our time together
is just ours.

1084
01:14:13,386 --> 01:14:15,216
It's our own creation.

1085
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:18,981
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine.

1086
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:23,158
And what's so cool
is that this whole evening...

1087
01:14:23,363 --> 01:14:26,854
...all our time together,
shouldn't officially be happening.

1088
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:30,524
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

1089
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:36,234
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1090
01:14:36,976 --> 01:14:38,409
I know.

1091
01:14:39,546 --> 01:14:42,344
But now, you're supposed to
produce the glass slipper...

1092
01:14:42,548 --> 01:14:44,140
...and see if it fits.

1093
01:14:47,287 --> 01:14:48,652
It'll fit.

1094
01:15:07,173 --> 01:15:08,868
<i>This friend of mine had a kid...</i>

1095
01:15:09,074 --> 01:15:12,305
...and it was a home birth,
so he was there helping out.

1096
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,310
But he said at that
profound moment of birth...

1097
01:15:16,783 --> 01:15:20,548
...he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time...

1098
01:15:20,753 --> 01:15:22,688
...trying to take its first breath.

1099
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:26,416
All he could think about was
that he was looking at something...

1100
01:15:26,626 --> 01:15:28,650
...that was gonna die someday.

1101
01:15:28,994 --> 01:15:31,087
He couldn't get it out of his head.

1102
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:35,426
And I think that's so true.
Everything is so finite.

1103
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:38,466
But don't you think that's what...

1104
01:15:38,671 --> 01:15:42,005
...makes our time and specific moments
so important?

1105
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:43,073
Yeah, I know.

1106
01:15:43,443 --> 01:15:45,604
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1107
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:52,244
After tomorrow, we'll probably
never see each other again, right?

1108
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:56,381
You don't think we'll
ever see each other?

1109
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,320
What do you think?

1110
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,189
Actually, I don't know.

1111
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:10,497
I hadn't planned another...

1112
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:14,265
Me too. I live in Paris,
you live in the U.S. I understand.

1113
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:17,238
I'd hate to make you fly.
You'd hate to fly, right?

1114
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:19,670
I'm not so scared of flying.

1115
01:16:20,546 --> 01:16:21,570
I mean, I could.

1116
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,475
Well, if you were gonna...

1117
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,274
...come to the U.S...

1118
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:26,917
...or if, you know, if I...

1119
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:29,554
I mean, I could come back here.

1120
01:16:30,623 --> 01:16:31,783
What?

1121
01:16:32,626 --> 01:16:35,856
No, let's just be rational adults
about this.

1122
01:16:38,797 --> 01:16:40,493
We should try something different.

1123
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:43,930
It's not so bad if tonight
is our only night, right?

1124
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:47,137
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1125
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,172
They end up writing once,
calling each other twice.

1126
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:52,140
Right. Fizzles out.

1127
01:16:52,444 --> 01:16:54,935
Yeah, I don't want that.
I hate that.

1128
01:16:55,948 --> 01:16:57,541
I hate that too.

1129
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:01,449
Why does everybody think
relationships should last forever?

1130
01:17:01,688 --> 01:17:03,780
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1131
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:08,185
But you think tonight's it?

1132
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:11,953
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1133
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:16,025
It's the only way, no?

1134
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:20,470
Well, all right.

1135
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:23,270
Let's do it.

1136
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,942
No delusions, no projections.

1137
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:29,337
We'll just make tonight great.

1138
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:33,246
Let's do that.

1139
01:17:50,737 --> 01:17:52,966
We should do some kind of handshake.

1140
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:54,702
Give me your hand.

1141
01:17:58,177 --> 01:18:01,113
To our one and only...

1142
01:18:01,948 --> 01:18:03,438
...night together...

1143
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,743
...and the hours that remain.

1144
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,386
What?

1145
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:20,496
It's just...

1146
01:18:20,867 --> 01:18:22,663
It's depressing, no?

1147
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:26,434
Now, the only thing
we're gonna think of is...

1148
01:18:26,639 --> 01:18:28,573
...when we'll have to say goodbye.

1149
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:32,368
We could say goodbye now.
Then we won't worry about it.

1150
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:33,904
Now?

1151
01:18:34,713 --> 01:18:35,873
Say goodbye.

1152
01:18:36,082 --> 01:18:37,572
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1153
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:40,118
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1154
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:42,082
- Later.
- Later, yeah.

1155
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:13,476
Here's the plan.

1156
01:19:13,685 --> 01:19:16,984
You're gonna grab the glasses,
and I'm gonna get the wine.

1157
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:19,185
- Red wine.
- Red wine. Right.

1158
01:19:19,391 --> 01:19:22,520
- You think you can do that?
- No problem.

1159
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:29,596
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

1160
01:19:31,537 --> 01:19:32,663
Hello.

1161
01:19:37,176 --> 01:19:38,474
Do you speak English?

1162
01:19:38,677 --> 01:19:40,737
- A bit.
- Yeah? A bit?

1163
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:43,574
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

1164
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:45,579
...which is that...

1165
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:47,853
You see that girl over there?

1166
01:19:52,257 --> 01:19:54,725
Well, this is our only night together...

1167
01:19:55,395 --> 01:19:56,918
...and she...

1168
01:19:58,997 --> 01:20:02,296
The problem is that she wants
a bottle of red wine...

1169
01:20:02,502 --> 01:20:04,662
...and I don't have any money.

1170
01:20:07,073 --> 01:20:09,541
But I was thinking
that you might want to...

1171
01:20:10,577 --> 01:20:14,137
...give me the address of this bar,
and I would promise...

1172
01:20:14,546 --> 01:20:17,983
...to send you the money, and you'd
be making our night complete.

1173
01:20:18,184 --> 01:20:20,118
You would send me the money?

1174
01:20:26,225 --> 01:20:27,488
Your hand?

1175
01:20:43,676 --> 01:20:46,042
For the greatest night in your life.

1176
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:47,940
Thank you very much.

1177
01:21:11,637 --> 01:21:15,233
So often I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments...

1178
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,502
...like traveling or staying up
all night and watching the sunrise.

1179
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,939
And I knew those were special moments.

1180
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,779
But something was always wrong.

1181
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,149
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1182
01:21:30,923 --> 01:21:33,085
I knew that what I was feeling...

1183
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:37,354
...exactly what was so important to me,
they didn't understand.

1184
01:21:42,034 --> 01:21:44,025
But I'm happy to be with you.

1185
01:21:46,773 --> 01:21:49,240
You couldn't know
why a night like this...

1186
01:21:49,442 --> 01:21:51,932
...is so important
to my life right now...

1187
01:21:52,145 --> 01:21:53,543
...but it is.

1188
01:21:56,649 --> 01:21:58,617
This is a great morning.

1189
01:21:59,185 --> 01:22:00,948
It is a great morning.

1190
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:05,554
Do you think we have others like this?

1191
01:22:08,528 --> 01:22:11,655
What about our rational, adult decision?

1192
01:22:11,863 --> 01:22:13,524
Oh, yeah.

1193
01:22:17,904 --> 01:22:21,135
I know what you mean about wishing
somebody wasn't there.

1194
01:22:22,175 --> 01:22:24,109
It's just, usually, it's myself...

1195
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,470
...that I wish I could get away from.

1196
01:22:27,113 --> 01:22:29,012
Seriously, think about this.

1197
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:31,744
I have never been anywhere...

1198
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:33,645
...that I haven't been.

1199
01:22:34,186 --> 01:22:36,519
I've never had a kiss...

1200
01:22:36,722 --> 01:22:38,747
...when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1201
01:22:38,957 --> 01:22:40,823
You know, I've never...

1202
01:22:41,027 --> 01:22:44,257
...gone to the movies when
I wasn't there in the audience.

1203
01:22:44,463 --> 01:22:47,057
I've never been out bowling
if I wasn't there...

1204
01:22:47,265 --> 01:22:48,823
...making some stupid joke.

1205
01:22:49,034 --> 01:22:51,935
That's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

1206
01:22:52,137 --> 01:22:54,265
It's just, they are sick to death...

1207
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:56,738
...of being around themselves.

1208
01:22:57,510 --> 01:23:01,207
Let's say that you and I
were together all the time.

1209
01:23:01,413 --> 01:23:03,644
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms.

1210
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,581
The way...

1211
01:23:05,784 --> 01:23:09,015
...the way every time
that we would have people over...

1212
01:23:09,622 --> 01:23:12,853
...Id be insecure, and I'd get
a little too drunk.

1213
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:17,426
Or the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story...

1214
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,393
...again and again.

1215
01:23:21,134 --> 01:23:23,295
You see, I've heard
all those stories...

1216
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:26,197
...so of course I'm sick of myself.

1217
01:23:30,342 --> 01:23:31,832
But being with you...

1218
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:36,742
...it's made me feel like
I was somebody else.

1219
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:42,447
I mean, the only other way
to lose yourself like that is...

1220
01:23:43,322 --> 01:23:45,551
...you know, dancing...

1221
01:23:45,925 --> 01:23:47,859
...or alcohol...

1222
01:23:48,493 --> 01:23:51,360
...or drugs, or stuff like that.

1223
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:55,162
Fucking.

1224
01:23:56,402 --> 01:23:59,564
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1225
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,682
Do you know what I want?

1226
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:18,185
What?

1227
01:24:21,527 --> 01:24:23,118
To be kissed.

1228
01:24:26,431 --> 01:24:28,059
Well, I could do that.

1229
01:24:42,047 --> 01:24:43,105
Wait.

1230
01:24:47,487 --> 01:24:49,351
I have to say something stupid.

1231
01:24:50,989 --> 01:24:52,014
All right.

1232
01:24:53,493 --> 01:24:55,119
It's very stupid.

1233
01:24:58,264 --> 01:25:00,425
I don't think we should
sleep together.

1234
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:07,229
I want to, but since we're never
going to see each other again...

1235
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,340
...it'll make me feel bad.

1236
01:25:10,243 --> 01:25:12,972
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

1237
01:25:18,384 --> 01:25:20,851
I know. It's not very adult.

1238
01:25:21,052 --> 01:25:23,920
Maybe it's a female thing.
I can't help it.

1239
01:25:24,457 --> 01:25:26,287
Let's see each other again.

1240
01:25:29,028 --> 01:25:33,020
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

1241
01:25:33,565 --> 01:25:37,502
I don't want to just get laid.
I want to... I mean...

1242
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:40,131
I mean, I think we should.

1243
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:43,400
We die in the morning, right?

1244
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,746
- I think we should.
- Then it's like some male fantasy.

1245
01:25:47,947 --> 01:25:51,144
Meet a French girl,
fuck her and never see her again.

1246
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:54,944
And have this great story to tell.
I don't want...

1247
01:25:55,154 --> 01:25:57,884
...this great evening to
just have been for that.

1248
01:25:58,724 --> 01:26:02,251
Okay, we don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

1249
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:15,106
You don't want to see me again?

1250
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:17,804
No, of course I do.

1251
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:20,604
If somebody gave me
the choice right now...

1252
01:26:20,813 --> 01:26:23,713
...of to never see you again
or to marry you...

1253
01:26:23,949 --> 01:26:25,042
...I would marry you.

1254
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:27,412
Maybe that's a lot
of romantic bullshit...

1255
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:30,350
...but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

1256
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:34,622
Actually...

1257
01:26:36,628 --> 01:26:41,362
...I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

1258
01:26:45,003 --> 01:26:47,904
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

1259
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:01,082
Why do we make everything
so complicated?

1260
01:27:01,287 --> 01:27:02,777
I don't know.

1261
01:28:04,582 --> 01:28:08,314
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get back to Paris?

1262
01:28:08,787 --> 01:28:10,345
Call my parents.

1263
01:28:10,588 --> 01:28:11,953
What about you?

1264
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:16,421
I don't know. I'll probably go
pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1265
01:28:16,628 --> 01:28:18,061
You have a dog?
I love dogs.

1266
01:28:18,264 --> 01:28:19,890
- You do?
- Yeah.

1267
01:28:20,231 --> 01:28:22,131
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1268
01:28:23,168 --> 01:28:25,729
I don't know.
We're back in real time.

1269
01:28:26,137 --> 01:28:27,832
I know. I hate that.

1270
01:28:28,173 --> 01:28:29,470
What is that?

1271
01:28:31,543 --> 01:28:33,569
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1272
01:28:34,046 --> 01:28:35,672
Check that out.

1273
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:37,845
Somebody's playing.

1274
01:28:44,622 --> 01:28:45,646
That's cool.

1275
01:29:04,243 --> 01:29:06,506
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

1276
01:29:06,712 --> 01:29:08,077
Of course.

1277
01:29:12,018 --> 01:29:13,042
Oh, wow.

1278
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:19,016
I'm gonna take your picture...

1279
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:22,283
...so I never forget you...

1280
01:29:24,596 --> 01:29:25,859
...or all this.

1281
01:29:26,631 --> 01:29:28,259
Okay, me too.

1282
01:30:26,658 --> 01:30:30,117
"The years shall run like rabbits."

1283
01:30:32,664 --> 01:30:33,791
What?

1284
01:30:35,868 --> 01:30:37,198
Nothing.

1285
01:30:39,104 --> 01:30:40,868
I have...

1286
01:30:41,372 --> 01:30:43,533
...this recording of Dylan Thomas...

1287
01:30:43,809 --> 01:30:45,800
...reading a W.H. Auden poem.

1288
01:30:46,011 --> 01:30:48,672
He's got a great voice.

1289
01:30:50,615 --> 01:30:51,810
It's like...

1290
01:30:53,152 --> 01:30:55,346
"All the clocks in the city

1291
01:30:55,554 --> 01:30:58,351
Began to whirr and chime:

1292
01:30:58,591 --> 01:31:01,082
<i>'O let not Time deceive you</i>

1293
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:03,886
You cannot conquer Time.

1294
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:06,323
In headaches and in worry

1295
01:31:06,664 --> 01:31:09,565
Vaguely life leaks away

1296
01:31:09,768 --> 01:31:11,997
And Time will have his fancy

1297
01:31:12,203 --> 01:31:14,797
Tomorrow or today.'"

1298
01:31:15,373 --> 01:31:17,001
Something like that.

1299
01:31:17,976 --> 01:31:19,171
That's good.

1300
01:31:26,784 --> 01:31:30,653
When you talked earlier
about after a few years...

1301
01:31:30,855 --> 01:31:33,484
...how a couple would begin
to hate each other...

1302
01:31:33,692 --> 01:31:35,659
...by anticipating their reactions...

1303
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,886
...or getting tired
of their mannerisms.

1304
01:31:38,631 --> 01:31:40,997
I think it would be
the opposite for me.

1305
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:46,502
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone.

1306
01:31:47,739 --> 01:31:49,400
The way he's gonna part his hair...

1307
01:31:49,608 --> 01:31:51,734
...which shirt he's gonna
wear that day...

1308
01:31:51,944 --> 01:31:56,176
...knowing the exact story he'd tell
in a given situation.

1309
01:31:57,882 --> 01:32:00,408
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

1310
01:32:22,073 --> 01:32:24,405
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

1311
01:32:24,777 --> 01:32:26,744
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1312
01:32:26,945 --> 01:32:28,173
Play?

1313
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:29,711
The cow?

1314
01:32:29,914 --> 01:32:31,644
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1315
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:34,079
Oh, no. We missed it.

1316
01:32:59,778 --> 01:33:01,769
You know what bus to take
to the airport?

1317
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:02,878
No problem.

1318
01:33:03,082 --> 01:33:06,483
- I should get on this one.
- Right here. You wanna get on there?

1319
01:33:10,288 --> 01:33:12,222
I guess this is it, no?

1320
01:33:13,891 --> 01:33:15,381
I really...

1321
01:33:20,765 --> 01:33:23,097
- You know...
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

1322
01:33:29,742 --> 01:33:33,234
Have a great life. Have fun
with everything you're gonna do.

1323
01:33:33,444 --> 01:33:35,810
Good luck with school and all that.

1324
01:33:37,216 --> 01:33:38,739
I hate this.

1325
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:41,943
Me too.
The train is about to leave.

1326
01:33:49,761 --> 01:33:52,457
You know all this bullshit
we're talking about...

1327
01:33:52,664 --> 01:33:55,225
...not seeing each other?
I don't want that.

1328
01:33:55,434 --> 01:33:56,627
I don't either.

1329
01:33:56,835 --> 01:33:58,393
- You don't?
- I waited for you to say it.

1330
01:33:58,604 --> 01:34:00,162
Why didn't you say something?

1331
01:34:00,372 --> 01:34:02,533
I was afraid
you didn't wanna see me.

1332
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,002
What do you wanna do?

1333
01:34:05,144 --> 01:34:08,113
Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

1334
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:10,509
Five years? That's a long time.

1335
01:34:10,716 --> 01:34:14,152
It's awful. It's like
a sociological experiment.

1336
01:34:14,386 --> 01:34:16,377
- How about one year?
- One year.

1337
01:34:17,288 --> 01:34:19,381
- How about six months?
- Six months?

1338
01:34:20,259 --> 01:34:22,021
It's gonna be freezing.

1339
01:34:22,226 --> 01:34:24,889
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

1340
01:34:28,067 --> 01:34:30,001
Six months from now or last night?

1341
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:35,132
Last night. Six months
from last night, which was...

1342
01:34:35,407 --> 01:34:36,668
...June 16th.

1343
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:41,403
So track nine, six months from now
at 6:00 at night.

1344
01:34:41,613 --> 01:34:42,545
December.

1345
01:34:43,314 --> 01:34:46,681
It's a train ride for you,
but I gotta fly all the way here.

1346
01:34:46,885 --> 01:34:48,351
But I'm gonna be here.

1347
01:34:48,554 --> 01:34:50,851
- Okay, me too.
- All right.

1348
01:34:52,591 --> 01:34:54,149
We won't call, write or...

1349
01:34:54,359 --> 01:34:55,792
No, it's depressing.

1350
01:34:59,097 --> 01:35:00,860
Your train's gonna leave.

1351
01:35:01,065 --> 01:35:02,693
Say goodbye.

1352
01:35:03,402 --> 01:35:04,231
Bye.

1353
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:06,765
Goodbye.

1354
01:35:07,905 --> 01:35:09,100
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1355
01:35:10,576 --> 01:35:11,735
Later.
