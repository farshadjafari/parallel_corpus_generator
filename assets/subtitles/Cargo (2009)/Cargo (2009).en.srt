1
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,400
You were right. Earth won't make it.

2
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,600
Even the last ones who escaped earth arrived.

3
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,011
But there is no more place in here either.

4
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,463
The epidemics are spreading faster.

5
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,047
I'm not able to keep up.

6
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,261
The people are dying in my arms.

7
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,900
I applied as a doctor on a cargo ship.

8
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,400
Four years until we are there and 4 years back.

9
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,370
I'll spend most of the time in hibernation.

10
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,000
This single flight...

11
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
... and I'll have enough money to ...

12
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
... go to Rhea.

13
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,833
Then we'll finally be together again.

14
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,472
Did you hear my dear sister? I have to go.

15
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,600
I want to get to Rhea.

16
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,877
And finally see you and the kids again.

17
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
Dr. Laura Portmann?

18
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Anna Lindbergh, first officer.

19
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,880
Welcome aboard.

20
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Everybody listen.

21
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,500
Miyuki Yoshida, system administrator.

22
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,300
This loudmouth here is Vespucci.

23
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,931
Thankfully Prokoff isn't talking that much.

24
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,738
Dr. Portmann.

25
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:44,700
Station 42 will be upgraded to a transport hub.

26
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,797
It's in the Orth's Cloud, half way to Proxima ...

27
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:57,789
... and is in a stable orbit around RH278.

28
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,607
The autopilot is activated.

29
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,839
Because of all the recent terror attacks ...

30
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,300
... the temporary government ordered to have ...

31
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,596
... a sky marshal on every ship.

32
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,156
Damn snitches.

33
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:17,238
It is said, that the "Maschinen Stuermer" are ...

34
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:20,341
... preparing for major sabotage acts.

35
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:25,000
This ship is already decaying, no one would sabotage anything.

36
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,900
Lt. Samuel Decker. Space Security Agency.

37
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,600
We will seal the cargo compartment in 30 minutes.

38
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,200
If you want to get to know someone, better do it now.

39
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
At 0200 the engines will started.

40
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,790
At 0230 we will meet at the cryo chambers.

41
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,720
Have a good company.

42
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,300
According to resolution 278 of the RBS ...

43
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,300
... from now on there will be sky marshals even on cargo flights.

44
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,637
Just accept me as a part of the crew.

45
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,500
"This is an informational broadcast of the TSA."

46
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,000
"The threat of terror attacks has never been as present since the great collapse."

47
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,730
"Klaus Bruckner is still on the run after his latest terror attack."

48
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,000
"This man is responsible for the latest bombings ...

49
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,500
"... on the stations 20, 23 and 24."

50
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,000
"While he is claiming responsibility for the current attacks, ..."

51
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,721
"... he keeps on propagating the messages of the "Maschinen Stuermer"."

52
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:45,882
"We are living in machines."

53
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:48,883
"What are we producing? Machines."

54
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:51,800
"Our enemy is the TSA."

55
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,893
"There will be no peace as long as technology is ruling us."

56
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,500
"Down with the machines!"

57
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,047
"Down with the stations!"

58
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:05,000
"Because of the latest events, the TSA ordered, ..."

59
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,576
"... to ensure the safety of ship and crew, ..."

60
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:11,000
"... each flight to be accompanied by a security officer."

61
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,838
"Support the sky marshal on his duty and ..."

62
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,167
Listen everybody, this will be the order of shifts.

63
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:19,500
Each shift will take 8 and a half months.

64
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,767
I'll take the first.

65
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:22,800
Then Lindbergh...

66
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
... Yoshida ...

67
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,900
... Vespucci ...

68
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,500
... Prokoff ...

69
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,800
... Portmann.

70
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
At the end to deploy the cargo, Lindbergh again.

71
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,400
And if someone should face any problems, ...

72
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,791
... feel free to knock on Deckers tank.

73
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,000
"Dear Laura,"

74
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,571
"I'm sending you some sunshine from Rhea."

75
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:58,500
"I haven't had you in my arms for such a long time ..."

76
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
"It's not good that you are doing cargo flights."

77
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,800
"We are worried."

78
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,500
"People are telling each other that the "Maschinen Stuermer" ..."

79
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,000
"... are becoming more and more aggressive."

80
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,846
"But what do you expect us to believe from four year's old information?"

81
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:16,200
"I don't even want to think about what could have happened in the mean time."

82
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,826
"I really hope that you are doing well."

83
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:21,547
"Please stay in touch."

84
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,500
"See you soon."

85
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,806
"I miss you."

86
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,847
Dear Arianne,

87
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,627
I miss you too.

88
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:58,500
It is so unbelievable cold in here, you couldn't imagine.

89
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,340
I'll show you some pics of the mess I got myself into.

90
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,972
Well... Just two months left till the end of my shift.

91
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We are four light years away from earth.

92
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,300
And are transporting material to build a station,

93
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,000
so that one day, we will be able to fly to Proxima.

94
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It has been said that there are inhabitable planets too.

95
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,272
I really want to be with you.

96
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:30,000
Please don't worry,

97
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm doing fine.

98
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,920
See you soon.

99
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:28,000
What are you doing here?

100
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Someone opened the cargo compartment.

101
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,906
I was automatically woken up.

102
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,000
Why did you open up the gate?

103
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,999
You know that it is strictly forbidden to enter the cargo compartment.

104
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,800
Something is inside the port.

105
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
That's impossible.

106
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,600
Something is behind the port.

107
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,000
We have to wake the crew now.

108
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,800
No, the hibernation phases must be kept intact.

109
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,200
But why don't you show it to me?

110
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,500
The rules say, that under exceptional circumstances ...

111
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,161
... we have to wake up the captain.

112
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,479
It seems as if Dr. Portmann isn't able to handle loneliness very well.

113
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,658
I'm sorry that we've awakened you.

114
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,182
Let's just hope that you are sure.

115
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,013
The suits have been thrown around because of the over pressure.

116
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,695
The compartment was open for several times throughout your shift.

117
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,678
I hope for you that this was just a technical failure.

118
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,418
Let's go.

119
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:14,508
The cargo compartment is split up into 9 sectors.

120
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:16,411
You take A to C.

121
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:18,000
You take D to F.

122
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
And I'll take the rest.

123
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,521
Shouldn't we stay together?

124
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:24,861
I don't want to stay overnight.

125
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,833
We'll stay in contact...

126
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,100
The containers are all locked.

127
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,313
That is correct, you should know that Decker.

128
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,542
Didn't find anything suspicious 'till now.

129
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:48,000
Except that we are not fully loaded. Answer.

130
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
Me neither.

131
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,500
Roger. Keep searching. Over.

132
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,380
Lacroix, here Laura.

133
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,052
Lacroix!

134
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,300
Fuck!

135
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,500
Decker?

136
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,700
Decker!

137
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,200
"What happened?"

138
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
I think Lacroix has fallen down.

139
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,000
"What? Where are you?"

140
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,685
In sector E4-20.

141
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm going down to sector G.

142
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,649
"I'm coming!"

143
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,800
Lacroix!

144
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,530
Do you hear me?

145
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,213
Lacroix, do you hear me?

146
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,400
Is he alive?

147
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,331
We must get him out of the cold now!

148
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,000
The gate!

149
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,800
According to the regulations, I'll be in command of the ship.

150
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,000
Prokoff, Vespucci fix the gate.

151
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,600
The cargo compartment must be sealed as soon as possible.

152
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,000
Yoshida, you'll verify all entrys in the main computer ...

153
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,801
... and check for suspicious activities.

154
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:23,300
And you will examine Lacroixs corpse.

155
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,530
I want the exact cause of death.

156
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,371
Start recording.

157
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,556
Multiple spline fracture.

158
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Craniocerebral injury.

159
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,236
Supposedly caused by a fall from a severe height.

160
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,746
Time of Death: Some minutes after the impact.

161
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,500
I thought that we were just transporting construction materials.

162
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,200
That's what I was thinking too.

163
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Whats wrong with the gate?

164
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,000
The fuck is. Everything is stuck and the gears seem to be broken too.

165
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,000
It must have been here.

166
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,749
Sealed.

167
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,355
I have Lacroix's batch.

168
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,600
A child.

169
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,489
It's a child!

170
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:17,885
All containers are full of humans.

171
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,211
"Vespucci, Prokoff."

172
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,000
Yes?

173
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,152
"Please come to sector F7-21."

174
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Why the heck do we transport humans to Station 42?

175
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,325
Fuuuuuuuu

176
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,143
Thats really ...

177
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,498
Shit!

178
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,200
Get moving!

179
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Go go go!

180
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,938
Laura!

181
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,075
Laura!

182
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,500
What's going on in here?

183
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
The containers are full of humans.

184
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,600
The cargo is the shipping companies business.

185
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,300
Lacroix was murdered.

186
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,200
Lacroix opened the door and because of the ...

187
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,200
... containers over pressure he had been pushed in to the abyss.

188
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,600
Someone set the containers in motion and we got almost killed.

189
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,300
The containers are moving automatically, to prevent freezing.

190
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,448
That's the reason why it's forbidden to be in the cargo compartment.

191
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:03,200
Somebody is on board of the ship.

192
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
He killed Lacroix and almost us too.

193
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,172
Did you know that there were humans in the containers?

194
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,529
This tank will be returned immediately.

195
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:14,930
This is a human!

196
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,171
As a doctor, I am responsible for the people on board.

197
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:20,857
And I will examine this girl now.

198
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:23,000
Exactly what I was thinking.

199
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,500
And furthermore I am authorized to inspect any incident on this ship.

200
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,500
The containers with the tanks may have something to do with Lacroix's death.

201
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,631
Then do your duty.

202
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:35,405
But you can be sure that I will report this incident.

203
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,438
Inspecting tank. Starting record.

204
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,600
No usable scans from the abdomen retrievable.

205
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,566
Switching to high frequency.

206
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,700
HF scans in the head area possible.

207
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,700
The girl shows some minor brain activity.

208
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,479
I assume a coma caused by hibernation.

209
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,215
Stopping record.

210
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,246
Did you find something?

211
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,500
It will take some time to have precise results.

212
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,000
May I help?

213
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,578
Yes, maybe.

214
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:45,968
The tank is blocking the scanner and it's secured with an electronic lock.

215
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,498
Did you find something?

216
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,000
I need anything you can find on Decker.

217
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,841
Something is wrong with him. He should be on our side.

218
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:26,900
And?

219
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,800
Because of an asymetric RSA encryption.

220
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,523
Could take some time.

221
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,218
What do you know about Station 42?

222
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:53,000
En uninhabited station.

223
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,500
Is officially being upgraded to a transport hub for ships heading to Proxima.

224
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
And inofficially?

225
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,100
Why did you enlist for this mission?

226
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,300
I need money, that's it.

227
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,600
You want to go to Rhea.

228
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,800
Yes.

229
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,900
Why?

230
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,800
My sister lives on Rhea.

231
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,000
She won the visa to Rhea seven years ago.

232
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,868
She is living our dream.

233
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,367
Probably the automatic sorting again.

234
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,500
And if there is really something on board?

235
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,010
Fuck it. Let's just try to fix this mess asap.

236
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,742
Starting record.

237
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,704
The girls brain is marbled with an anorganic tissue.

238
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:12,696
Entry of the tissue into the body.

239
00:46:12,696 --> 00:46:16,034
Cervical C4, neck spline.

240
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,300
Looks like ingrowth.

241
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,737
Or pitted.

242
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,200
A VR connector.

243
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,100
Appearantly a perfected one.

244
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,700
I've never seen something like this.

245
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,100
We could connect her to an external system.

246
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,300
That's too dangerous.

247
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,000
That could lead to irreperable neural damages.

248
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That's the only way to get more information about the access.

249
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,500
Under no circumstances.

250
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
I will not risk this kids life.

251
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,755
Well.

252
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,862
For now, keep this examinations results between us.

253
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:01,705
Ok?

254
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,000
Hi Hanna.

255
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,486
So much stuff is going on in here ...

256
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:22,228
... that I would like to share with you.

257
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,300
Why are we that far away from each other?

258
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,315
And it takes ages for the messages to arrive.

259
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,100
I just don't understand what's happening on board anymore.

260
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,800
We found a girl in the cargo compartement.

261
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,800
I'm trying to help her.

262
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,100
We'll see each other soon.

263
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,266
And then I'll tell you everything.

264
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,600
I was so delighted to receive your message!

265
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,800
It's so good to hear your voice and know that you are alive.

266
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,500
You found a girl?

267
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,500
I don't get it.

268
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,100
I would like to talk to you in person.

269
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,000
Why is it taking so long for our messages to arrive.

270
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,100
Laura listen.

271
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,300
We don't want you to do any more cargo flights.

272
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,800
Come directly to Rhea.

273
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,000
You could stay with us for a while.

274
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,300
We will prepare a room for you and...

275
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,500
I'm anticipating your arrival.

276
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,303
Soon you'll be with us.

277
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,022
I don't get what's happening here.

278
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,502
How is it possible that my sister answers this fast?

279
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,081
Why do you have knowledge about neuronal accesses?

280
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,858
Why shouldn't I tell anybody about the examination?

281
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,258
What do you know about the people in the tanks?

282
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,395
Who the hell are you?

283
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:02,000
Everybody report to the bridge asap.

284
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,400
Yoshida scanned all log entries and compared them with the backup.

285
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:17,279
She discovered that a crew member manipulated the log files of the cryo chambers.

286
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,900
Why didn't you tell us that you have been awakened on a regular basis?

287
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,500
It's part of my duties to check the ship periodically.

288
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,600
So you are not denying that you left the cryo chambers without our knowledge.

289
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,000
No, that is correct.

290
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,700
Where have you been when Lacroix died?

291
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,686
I knew it! Damn Snitch!

292
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,980
I was in sector F5-17.

293
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:49,015
And you can't demand an account for the work I am doing for RBS.

294
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:50,597
Arrest him.

295
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,574
Put your weapon away!

296
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,300
I have immunity. You know that.

297
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,300
Not if you are suspected of murder.

298
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,954
Put your weapon away!

299
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,000
I might have believed you if you hadn't resited.

300
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,800
Vespucci how much more time do you need with the gate?

301
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,777
48 hours.

302
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,500
Dr. Portmann return that tank to the cargo compartment asap.

303
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,900
That's impossible. I gave the patient a drug that regresses the filaments.

304
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,200
She is not stable. She can't be returned.

305
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,000
That's none of my business!

306
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,400
I want that tank returned before the gate is fixed.

307
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,000
This is an order!

308
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,978
Do you understand?

309
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,300
Get him to the cryo chambers.

310
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,000
He must go to the medical station first.

311
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,959
I must treat his wounds or the blood will contaminate the cooling fluid.

312
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,414
You are doing your job well.

313
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,639
Did you receive another message from your sister?

314
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,333
Vespucci, medical station please.

315
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:30,300
Laura!

316
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,172
Laura wait!

317
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,500
We are not flying to Station 42.

318
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,857
Where are we heading then?

319
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,108
To Rhea.

320
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,600
Could you do me a favour?

321
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,765
Would you please take a look if we are really heading for Station 42?

322
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,000
And?

323
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,500
I was on the bridge and locked into the system.

324
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,252
The target coordinates of our flight are well protected, but ...

325
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:36,400
... I can tell you for certain that we are not heading for Station 42.

326
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,500
And it's definite too that ...

327
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,300
... nobody would've been able to change the coordinates while the journey.

328
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,210
Because you can only set them before the departure.

329
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:54,300
I'm trying to spot where else we might fly to.

330
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,800
But that means that Decker wasn't even able to change the coordinates.

331
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,971
How long does it take a message to arrive at Rhea?

332
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,500
Probably half an eternity. As always.

333
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,632
Several years?

334
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,800
My sister answered me within 20 minutes.

335
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,619
If that's true, then Lindbergh lied to us.

336
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:23,900
Only she has the logins for the target coordinates.

337
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,929
Decker told me that we are flying to Rhea.

338
00:58:28,335 --> 00:58:31,000
Hey hey hey, look who's here!

339
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,061
The gate has been fixed.

340
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:36,837
And that's why Prokoff and I are throwing a little party in the squad rooms.

341
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,400
I don't have any time. Got work to do.

342
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,700
And what's with our little party?

343
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,500
Thanks for your help!

344
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,100
But you are coming, right?

345
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,487
We heated the room just for this event.

346
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,000
You won't stay that long too, right?

347
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,000
The last doctor left afterwards for Rhea.

348
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,665
Our lot will never be able to afford that.

349
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,779
Doesn't even taste that shitty!

350
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:14,117
Probably the radiator.

351
01:00:20,488 --> 01:00:21,785
What are you doing?

352
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:24,092
The party isn't over yet.

353
01:00:25,074 --> 01:00:26,748
I'll bring Yoshida some tea too.

354
01:00:29,012 --> 01:00:30,689
Ok... but hurry.

355
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:33,630
And make sure Lindbergh doesn't notice anything.

356
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,544
She'd ruin our party.

357
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,332
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

358
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:03,864
Decker...

359
01:02:03,864 --> 01:02:06,173
That son of a bitch is gone.

360
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:10,779
If I get my hands on him...

361
01:02:12,226 --> 01:02:14,142
He was woken up manually.

362
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:17,019
Someone must have let him out.

363
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:20,135
So we have a stowaway on board after all.

364
01:02:20,135 --> 01:02:21,324
Crap...

365
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:24,583
We'll search the whole ship.

366
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,163
You go with Portmann.

367
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:28,029
I'll go with Prokoff.

368
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:30,408
We'll start on the main section.

369
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:32,093
I'll lock all cargo bay access.

370
01:02:32,093 --> 01:02:34,542
If we don't find anything, we'll check out the rest.

371
01:03:39,725 --> 01:03:41,531
Sick bay is clear.

372
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:42,920
What's your situation?

373
01:03:43,843 --> 01:03:44,760
Nothing so far.

374
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,546
We're at the sluice.

375
01:03:58,632 --> 01:04:00,092
There's something below us.

376
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:08,631
Let's check out the lower deck.

377
01:04:33,089 --> 01:04:35,266
Looks like we have him.

378
01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:37,201
He must be in this duct.

379
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:42,539
Ok... you go in here.

380
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:44,677
I'll come from the other side.

381
01:04:44,677 --> 01:04:45,924
We'll kick his ass.

382
01:04:57,745 --> 01:05:01,576
Once he notices that I'm front of him, he'll have to turn around.

383
01:05:01,576 --> 01:05:03,909
When you see him, you shoot.

384
01:05:03,909 --> 01:05:05,290
Boom, over and done.

385
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,307
That bastard...he killed Yoshida and Lacroix.

386
01:05:09,307 --> 01:05:09,999
Don't forget that.

387
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:10,730
...blow...up...

388
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:12,636
Everythings grows again like it used to.

389
01:09:13,746 --> 01:09:15,894
We've been lied to from the very beginning.

390
01:09:17,099 --> 01:09:18,283
These plants here...

391
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:19,241
they're edible.

392
01:09:20,006 --> 01:09:23,913
The greenhouses keep out the acid rain.

393
01:09:24,882 --> 01:09:28,562
We purify our own water in underground tanks.

394
01:09:28,562 --> 01:09:32,346
We're completely independent from the system.

395
01:09:32,346 --> 01:09:34,728
And we continue to grow stronger.

396
01:09:34,728 --> 01:09:38,032
More people join us every day.

397
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:54,431
Freeze!

398
01:09:57,115 --> 01:09:57,702
Laura..

399
01:09:57,702 --> 01:10:00,000
Thank god, you're alive.

400
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,053
Calm down.

401
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:02,161
Where the hell were you?

402
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:03,867
We have everything under control.

403
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,095
We got him.

404
01:10:05,858 --> 01:10:06,862
Did you shoot?

405
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:12,222
Who is that?

406
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:14,488
Bruckner...

407
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,247
What was your plan?

408
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,775
No point in playing the hero.

409
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:44,802
Bruckner is dead.

410
01:10:44,802 --> 01:10:46,365
Who are you trying to protect?

411
01:10:48,146 --> 01:10:50,895
Rhea...is a simulation, a lie.

412
01:10:53,188 --> 01:10:54,482
The people in the tanks...

413
01:10:54,482 --> 01:10:55,373
Bullshit.

414
01:10:55,373 --> 01:11:00,417
Their brains are beeing used as neural units to create the simulation.

415
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:02,699
We talk to the people on Rhea all the time.

416
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,623
Kuiper is lying to all of humanity.

417
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:06,707
Everything is covered up.

418
01:11:06,707 --> 01:11:07,696
Get him out of here.

419
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:11,737
If people knew that parts of earth are habitable again...

420
01:11:11,737 --> 01:11:14,528
the whole system would break down.

421
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:16,974
You killed him, didn't you?

422
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:20,803
He went nuts.

423
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:21,606
He killed Lacroix.

424
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,543
And Yoshida?

425
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:27,699
Move it.

426
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:38,317
How's your little patient?

427
01:11:38,317 --> 01:11:39,057
Good.

428
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:44,086
I think we can move her back into the cargo hold.

429
01:11:45,226 --> 01:11:46,344
Excellent.

430
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,974
Prokoff and Vespucci will give you a hand.

431
01:11:49,692 --> 01:11:51,602
Then we can finally close the cargo hold and...

432
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:53,535
you'll go into crysleep.

433
01:11:53,535 --> 01:11:55,251
I will handle your shift.

434
01:12:44,005 --> 01:12:46,037
So.. you know about Rhea...

435
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:18,499
The simulation is only temporary...

436
01:13:24,552 --> 01:13:27,330
The colonization of Rhea was a failure from the get-go.

437
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:34,503
Our changes to the planet's ecosystem caused unforeseen consequences.

438
01:13:37,126 --> 01:13:39,154
We will find another planet.

439
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,019
And we won't repeat the mistakes we made on Rhea.

440
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,374
But until then...

441
01:13:45,374 --> 01:13:47,971
people need something to keep them alive.

442
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,536
And that thing is hope.

443
01:13:55,443 --> 01:13:59,259
What happens to those who find out they're living in a simulation?

444
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:08,922
The simulation is perfect...

445
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:10,570
I was in there myself.

446
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:13,663
It's impossible for anyone to notice anything.

447
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,111
Why are you doing all this?

448
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,015
You just don't get it.

449
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,742
Soon we'll be on Rhea.

450
01:14:28,742 --> 01:14:31,547
But you and your.. saboteur.. won't make it there alive.

451
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:35,782
Noone will care about the death of the ones who murdered the captain.

452
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:41,895
Did you know that we were going to Rhea?

453
01:15:11,077 --> 01:15:13,660
But... Rhea is a simulation...

454
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,839
Who cares?

455
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:16,881
Better than staying on this piece of junk.

456
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:22,579
What about all my plants?

457
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:25,942
You idiot, there will be more plants than you ever dreamed of.

458
01:15:26,685 --> 01:15:27,995
On Rhea, there is everything.

459
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:28,737
Everything.

460
01:15:41,601 --> 01:15:43,498
I couldn't tell you the truth.

461
01:15:57,134 --> 01:16:00,211
Laura.. there's many reasons not to trust me...

462
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:10,044
But we are the only ones who can finish this mission.

463
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:13,994
Will you help me?

464
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:18,675
Will you help me get my sister out of there?

465
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,574
We need two people to do this.

466
01:16:22,574 --> 01:16:24,315
It's impossible to enter the simulation on your own.

467
01:16:25,328 --> 01:16:27,817
We'll dock at Station 42 according to plan.

468
01:16:28,536 --> 01:16:31,811
We can delay the cargo unload procedure by 30 minutes.

469
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:33,751
The Kassandra will then unload automatically.

470
01:16:33,751 --> 01:16:36,276
Laura and me will be flying to the station.

471
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:39,434
And log into the system right here.

472
01:16:39,434 --> 01:16:40,863
How's that going to work?

473
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:45,677
The hardware used for connecting is here, in the connection modules.

474
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:57,845
I will connect Laura to the simulation here on the main module.

475
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:01,012
Once she's in, she will send a message to Earth.

476
01:17:01,012 --> 01:17:02,990
Meanwhile, I'll go look for her sister's tank.

477
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,673
When we're done, we'll blow up the transponder of the main antenna.

478
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,778
The station itself stays fully operational.

479
01:17:11,778 --> 01:17:13,095
That means...

480
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:16,194
Everyone will keep living in the simulation.

481
01:17:16,194 --> 01:17:18,036
But they won't be able to send any more messages.

482
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:19,868
Laura's message..

483
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,400
will be the last.

484
01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:24,337
I hope people back home will believe us.

485
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,790
Is the Earth really habitable again?

486
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:08,579
We had 3 expeditions.

487
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:12,660
Nature is rampant.

488
01:18:13,797 --> 01:18:15,105
She's talking everything back.

489
01:18:18,245 --> 01:18:20,992
Whole cities are grown over up to the second floor.

490
01:18:25,352 --> 01:18:27,654
I'll bring Ariane back to Earth.

491
01:18:30,488 --> 01:18:32,296
There's millions of tanks, Laura..

492
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,013
Even if we do find her....

493
01:18:36,013 --> 01:18:39,095
I don't know in what condition she'll be in.

494
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:42,130
She was in the simulation for a long time.

495
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,706
We have to try.

496
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:51,100
I want to show her the Earth...

497
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:50,206
Has this interface been used before?

498
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:52,049
No, it's a prototype.

499
01:19:52,049 --> 01:19:54,841
It works like a neural connection for the simulation.

500
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:04,383
Don't be scared.

501
01:20:10,902 --> 01:20:12,452
27 minutes.

502
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,383
Don't you think we should...

503
01:20:18,383 --> 01:20:20,436
What?

504
01:20:20,436 --> 01:20:23,488
I'm doing this for you, and me. For both of us!

505
01:20:23,488 --> 01:20:24,681
As if I'll let this pass us by.

506
01:20:24,681 --> 01:20:27,724
We'll throw some guys out of their tanks and go in ourselves.

507
01:20:27,724 --> 01:20:29,963
Once the ship is unloaded, we'll be on Rhea!

508
01:20:42,095 --> 01:20:43,630
God damnit....

509
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:24,324
Prokoff.

510
01:22:24,324 --> 01:22:25,055
Do you hear me?

511
01:22:25,055 --> 01:22:27,873
I have Lindbergh's card.

512
01:22:28,549 --> 01:22:32,662
Reprogram the unload timer to 10 minutes, got it?

513
01:22:32,662 --> 01:22:35,226
Otherwise those 2 will make it back....

514
01:22:35,226 --> 01:22:36,674
and the containers won't be unloaded....

515
01:22:36,674 --> 01:22:38,591
and we won't be on Rhea, got it?

516
01:22:46,554 --> 01:22:49,154
We have to hurry.. let's meet in the cargo hold, ok?

517
01:22:54,418 --> 01:22:56,548
Decker? Can you hear me?

518
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:00,571
I have problems with my fuel cell.

519
01:23:07,056 --> 01:23:09,263
The cell is... *garbage*

520
01:23:09,263 --> 01:23:11,980
[scrambled]

521
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:15,510
...under no circumstances..open..gate

522
01:24:12,175 --> 01:24:13,662
Rhea here we come!

523
01:24:38,262 --> 01:24:40,359
...find..cell...

524
01:24:41,312 --> 01:24:42,992
..found nothing...

525
01:24:42,992 --> 01:24:44,944
...coming anyway...

526
01:24:47,443 --> 01:24:49,570
I don't think that's a good ide.....

527
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:49,802
..where you are...

528
01:24:49,802 --> 01:24:53,024
I'm trying to find Ariane's tank.

529
01:24:53,024 --> 01:24:55,246
Laura... copy..?

530
01:25:31,202 --> 01:25:32,349
Decker, can you hear me?

531
01:25:32,349 --> 01:25:33,170
Decker!

532
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:35,624
I can't control my thrusters anymore!

533
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,863
I'm drifting off!

534
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:43,507
Decker! Where are you?!

535
01:26:22,132 --> 01:26:23,317
Decker..where are you?

536
01:26:39,536 --> 01:26:40,587
I see you.

537
01:27:43,315 --> 01:27:44,969
I found Ariane's tank...

538
01:27:46,607 --> 01:27:47,540
Impossible...

539
01:27:49,419 --> 01:27:50,485
I'm sorry.

540
01:27:52,762 --> 01:27:53,647
I want to see her.

541
01:27:55,222 --> 01:27:57,719
Set the module to my sister's simulation.

542
01:27:59,348 --> 01:28:01,156
I'll send the message from there.

543
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:40,611
The Kassandra.

544
01:28:49,112 --> 01:28:51,059
Prokoff and Vespucci...

545
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,144
Those idiots.

546
01:28:52,668 --> 01:28:54,954
That means we have 7 minutes at the most...

547
01:28:54,954 --> 01:28:56,595
then I'll get you out manually.

548
01:28:56,595 --> 01:28:57,768
OK.

549
01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:55,839
Look how beatiful we have it here....

550
01:33:00,048 --> 01:33:02,000
Finally you can actually see it.

551
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,079
Finally...

552
01:33:04,928 --> 01:33:06,743
And your room is almost ready too!

553
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:09,691
You look beatiful.

554
01:33:11,661 --> 01:33:12,247
Come in.

555
01:33:13,123 --> 01:33:14,061
I'll show you everything.

556
01:33:15,369 --> 01:33:17,138
Kids, look who's here!

557
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,004
Laura are you crying?

558
01:33:32,789 --> 01:33:35,555
Ariane, I have to go for a minute.

559
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:37,961
What's wrong?

560
01:33:39,408 --> 01:33:41,145
I love you, Ariane.

561
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:49,776
Laura, where are you going?

562
01:34:47,332 --> 01:34:49,430
My name is Laura Portmann.

563
01:34:49,959 --> 01:34:52,012
This is the last message from Rhea.

564
01:34:52,921 --> 01:34:54,898
Rhea is not paradise.

565
01:34:55,905 --> 01:34:58,094
Rhea is a simulation.

566
01:34:59,095 --> 01:35:00,785
We will bring you proof.

567
01:35:02,425 --> 01:35:04,111
We were all betrayed.

568
01:35:06,588 --> 01:35:09,136
Everything about Rhea is a lie.

569
01:35:10,387 --> 01:35:11,834
We don't need Rhea.

570
01:35:13,183 --> 01:35:15,246
However, we still have Earth.

571
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:18,215
Earth is habitable again.

572
01:35:20,085 --> 01:35:23,709
Nobody will ever have contact with Rhea again.

573
01:35:25,364 --> 01:35:26,611
We're destroying the antennas now.

574
01:35:56,171 --> 01:35:57,035
Do you hear me?

575
01:35:58,163 --> 01:35:58,634
Yes.

576
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:02,335
Good, we must hurry.

577
01:36:02,335 --> 01:36:03,988
The Kassandra could launch anytime now...

578
01:36:05,856 --> 01:36:07,325
and you have to go back on your own.

579
01:36:07,325 --> 01:36:08,665
On my own?

580
01:36:11,336 --> 01:36:11,998
Yes.

581
01:36:14,709 --> 01:36:16,373
I'm not leaving without you.

582
01:36:16,373 --> 01:36:17,598
You have to.

583
01:36:17,598 --> 01:36:20,454
We won't make it far with just one jetpack.

584
01:36:20,454 --> 01:36:22,499
I gave you my fuel cell.

585
01:36:22,499 --> 01:36:25,987
It has enough fuel to get you to the Kassandra.

586
01:36:25,987 --> 01:36:27,477
I'm not leaving without you.

587
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,035
Go back to the girl.

588
01:36:32,035 --> 01:36:34,367
She's our only proof.

589
01:37:04,115 --> 01:37:04,809
Go.

590
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,627
I can't!

591
01:37:09,627 --> 01:37:09,903
You can.

592
01:37:12,591 --> 01:37:13,217
No...

593
01:37:16,965 --> 01:37:18,135
I love you.

594
01:40:02,744 --> 01:40:03,680
Where is the girl!?

595
01:40:27,432 --> 01:40:29,895
Noone will be able to send messages from Rhea now.

596
01:43:28,009 --> 01:43:30,438
My name is Laura Portmann.

597
01:43:30,438 --> 01:43:33,337
This is the last message from Rhea.

598
01:43:34,618 --> 01:43:36,501
Rhea is not paradise.

599
01:43:37,269 --> 01:43:39,786
Rhea is a simulation.

600
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:42,673
We will bring you proof.

601
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:45,592
We were all betrayed.

602
01:43:47,348 --> 01:43:48,714
We don't need Rhea.

603
01:43:50,279 --> 01:43:52,859
However, we still have have Earth.

604
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,218
Earth is habitable again.

605
01:43:57,081 --> 01:44:01,904
Nobody will ever have contact with Rhea again.

606
01:44:03,025 --> 01:44:04,709
We're destroying the antennas now.

607
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,000
Subtitled by

608
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,700
PumpAction

609
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:21,300
Surray

610
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:24,000
and very special thanks to

611
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Zotten

612
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,615
and our fellow humpers!

613
01:44:32,989 --> 01:44:39,610
Sorry Ronhrin that I didn't mention your name specifically, as I already uploaded this subtitle :)

614
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Huh... V1.01 ... fucked the first one a little bit up :D
