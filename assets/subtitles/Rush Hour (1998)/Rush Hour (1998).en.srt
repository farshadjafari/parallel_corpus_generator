1
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,960
Forgive me, Consul Han...

2
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,960
but I believe
we can ill afford...

3
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,880
to lose men
of your high character.

4
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,160
And speaking as a friend...

5
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,560
who's fought side by side
with you for 15 years...

6
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,920
I will sorely miss
the unshakable support...

7
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,760
you've given
the Royal Hong Kong Police.

8
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,960
So, on behalf of all Brits...

9
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,160
who have ever carried the shield
in Hong Kong...

10
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,440
we shall miss you.

11
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,160
We wish you nothing
but happiness...

12
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,640
as you take up your new post
in the United States.

13
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
Consul Han.

14
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,240
Thank you, Thomas.

15
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,760
You know Thomas is not going
to make this evening easy.

16
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
Excuse me.

17
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
Commander Griffin...

18
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,200
I am pleased to be able
to leave you and Hong Kong...

19
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,360
with a special gift tonight.

20
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,840
Earlier this evening,
Detective inspector Lee...

21
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,560
and his special task force
have once and for all...

22
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
crushed the Juntao
criminal organization...

23
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,120
and reclaimed artifacts...

24
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,640
from 5,000 years
of China's heritage.

25
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
Thank you.

26
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,480
This is the kind of legacy
I dreamt about.

27
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
Hong Kong forever.

28
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,080
To Hong Kong forever.

29
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
Soo Yung.

30
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
Stupid fool!

31
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,440
Get the hell out of my way!
Man, are you crazy?

32
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,560
Shoot!

33
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,760
You moron!

34
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,080
Clive, what's up, man?

35
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,160
You're late.

36
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
-I'm late?
-Yeah, you're late.

37
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,280
I've been waiting
in the back for over an hour.

38
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,760
-I was in the diner.
-I told you in the back.

39
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
Think I would do this shit
out front?

40
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,440
-I'm gonna get busted.
-You weren't in the diner.

41
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,720
I said in the back--
It don't even matter.

42
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,080
Let's do this.
What's that, a gun?

43
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,920
How many people
you killed this year?

44
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,400
Stop it, man.
Let's do it. Come on.

45
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't be late again.

46
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
I ain't gonna be late.
What we got?

47
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,920
That's tight.

48
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,520
That's beautiful. That's nice.
What's that?

49
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,560
-That's C-4.
-That's C-4?

50
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,800
-Oh, shit.
-What's the problem?

51
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,360
No problem. I been looking
everywhere for this shit.

52
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
How the hell you find some C-4?

53
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,000
The Iraqis
can't even get this shit.

54
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,640
Where'd you get this from?

55
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
It's a hot ticket.

56
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
You don't know how happy
you made me.

57
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
You got what I want.
Let me get that money.

58
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,600
Step away from the car.

59
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,720
Hey, officers.

60
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,520
Put your hands above your heads.
Just do it now.

61
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,440
Ain't no problem here.
Why y'all messing with us for?

62
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,320
All right, take it easy.

63
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,280
-You don't wanna do that.
-Yes, I do.

64
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,960
-No, he don't. He's playing.
-No, I ain't playing.

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,280
-Yes, he is, officer.
-I'm not playing!

66
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
Drop the gun!

67
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
He's just my cousin.
We're just talking.

68
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Get in your car and leave.

69
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,960
We can't do that.

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,280
I'll blow his head
all over the parking lot!

71
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
Go away and buy some doughnuts!

72
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,000
See? You made him mad.

73
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,120
Let me talk to him.
All right?

74
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,280
Don't move!

75
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,840
All right.
Everything's cool now.

76
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
He down. The gun's down.
Get back in the car and leave.

77
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,120
Hands on your head!

78
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,800
Everything's cool, officer.

79
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
Do it now!

80
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,080
Didn't I tell you?

81
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,640
Stop it! I got C-4 in the trunk!

82
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,000
Clive, guess what, man.

83
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,800
I forgot to tell you.
I'm LAPD.

84
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,160
You under arrest.

85
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,680
Soo Yung, come on,
we're gonna be late.

86
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,440
Let's go.

87
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,280
Excuse me.

88
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,320
What?

89
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Telephone. China.

90
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,520
Soo Yung, I love you.
Have a nice day.

91
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,280
Will you be home after school?

92
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
I am going to pick you up
myself.

93
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,960
When you walk by every night...

94
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,040
talkin' sweet
and lookin' fine...

95
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,880
I become hectic inside.

96
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,800
Baby, I'm so into you.

97
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
Darlin', if you only knew...

98
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,280
all the things
that float through my mind.

99
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
Is there a problem, officer?

100
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,600
No problem.

101
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,040
Just rush hour.

102
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,920
Security's in place?

103
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,840
You're sure all of the exhibits
will be ready by this weekend?

104
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,040
Yes, sir. Your opening remarks
are scheduled for 7:30.

105
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,600
Excuse me, Consul Han.

106
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm Warren Russ with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

107
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
This is Agent Whitney.

108
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,720
We need to speak with you
in private.

109
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
Excuse me.

110
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,120
I know this is a difficult time
for you, Consul...

111
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
but be assured
we'll get your daughter back.

112
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,120
But will you get her back alive?

113
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
We have the best agents
in the world on those streets.

114
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,440
I would like
one of my people to help.

115
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,280
Let me assure you, the FBI
considers this a top priority.

116
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,520
We have plenty of people
on the case.

117
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,280
Mr. Russ, I am not an American.

118
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,280
My daughter is not an American.

119
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
I understand that, sir--

120
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,840
He's already on the plane.

121
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,200
I trust you will treat him
with the same courtesy...

122
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,120
as you have shown me.

123
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,520
Ten people
jumped out of the trunk.

124
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,320
I started handling all of them.
Throwing them everywhere.

125
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Then two stupid cops
came out of nowhere...

126
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,160
messed everything up,
but then I regrouped.

127
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,600
I had to save their life.

128
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,680
It ain't in there.
Anyway, I save their life.

129
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,600
I start runnin',
trying to get the bomb--

130
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
I can't believe
you went without me.

131
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,920
I'll talk to y'all later,
all right?

132
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I'll tell you the best part
after work.

133
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,840
This is why nobody
will work with you...

134
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,000
why you're the only cop in the
department without a partner.

135
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Johnson, look, first of all,
if you want a date with me...

136
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,560
you have to wait on the list
like every other woman, OK?

137
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,560
Second of all, I work alone.

138
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,520
I don't need no partner
and ain't never gonna have one.

139
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,840
-Did Kojak have a partner?
-Yeah. The fat guy.

140
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,960
He wasn't never with him.
Did Columbo?

141
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,880
Captain Diel ordered me
to go with you...

142
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,560
because you needed bomb squad
backup, but once again...

143
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,080
you screwed me and yourself.

144
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,720
Look, Johnson,
it's dangerous out there.

145
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,960
It's safer for you
to be behind the desk.

146
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
We were supposed to be
on the same team.

147
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,760
Team?
Johnson, this is the LAPD...

148
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,840
the most hated cops
in the free world.

149
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,440
My own mama ashamed of me.

150
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
She tell everybody
I'm a drug dealer.

151
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,960
This is a pit stop for me.

152
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,720
I'm on the verge of leaving
you suckers behind.

153
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,360
Actually, you're on the verge
of being suspended.

154
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,560
Have a nice day.

155
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,320
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

156
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,600
Quit playin', girl.

157
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,960
I know you playin'.

158
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,040
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

159
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,760
This is a problem.
That's all I need...

160
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,440
some foreigner
getting his head blown off...

161
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,080
and creating
an international incident.

162
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,240
What can we do?
He's on his way.

163
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,240
Call the field office.
Have them send over a rookie.

164
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,680
We'll have him escort this guy
around a few days...

165
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,040
pretend to follow some leads,
show him some sights...

166
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,440
keep him out of our way.

167
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,640
You want to do that
to one of men?

168
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
What do you suggest?

169
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,360
Well, as long as we're
gonna humiliate someone...

170
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,320
might as well be LAPD.

171
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,040
Even if I had an extra man...

172
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,600
who would want
such a bullshit assignment?

173
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,320
Well, it's a disgrace to me.

174
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,200
It's a disgrace
to my department.

175
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
It's a disgrace to--

176
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,480
Dan, I'm sending someone
right over.

177
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,480
Captain, I know you read
the paper, but they lying.

178
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,880
I wouldn't do nothing like that.

179
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,600
You know how the paper is.
They just want a story.

180
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,360
Two officers were shot.
One man lost a pinkie.

181
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,640
But didn't nobody die.

182
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,360
-You destroyed half a block.
-That block was messed up.

183
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,760
-You lost lots of evidence.
-We got a little left.

184
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,720
What you did was dangerous
and completely against policy.

185
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,480
And not only that...

186
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,120
you did a good job.

187
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,320
What?

188
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,480
Everyone around here
is so image-conscious.

189
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,920
Everybody's so afraid
of their own goddamn shadow.

190
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,040
It's nice to meet
an L.A. detective...

191
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,520
who's willing to lay it
on the line.

192
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,800
Captain,
that's the same way I feel.

193
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,680
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody.

194
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,480
Every so often, we have to let
the general public know...

195
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,240
that we can still blow shit up.

196
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,200
You goddamn right.
That's the only way I work.

197
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,760
So that mean
I ain't gettin' suspended?

198
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
-Are you kidding?
-Don't know why I said that.

199
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,080
I just got a call from the FBI.

200
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
The 10-year-old daughter
of a Chinese diplomat...

201
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,160
was kidnapped this morning,
and they want you on the case.

202
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
FBI want me?

203
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
That's right.

204
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,920
-Stop lying.
-I don't lie.

205
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,600
-Tell the truth.
-I'm telling the truth.

206
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,560
Thank you, Captain.

207
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,640
Congratulations, Carter.
You are going to the show.

208
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,160
I'll look out for you
when I reach the top.

209
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,720
-I'm gonna make you mayor.
-I'd rather you didn't.

210
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,240
Hey, listen up!
lf anybody need me...

211
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm gonna be workin'
a big, big case for the FBI!

212
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,920
Yo. Take care of that for me.

213
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,040
I need one of those earpieces
immediately, all right?

214
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,440
Hey, how you doing?

215
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,200
I want the consul's personnel
records cross-checked...

216
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,600
with that new list
we received from Interpol.

217
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,320
See if you can make
any matches or connections.

218
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,200
OK, boys, what have we got?

219
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,120
Have we checked the consul
personnel records yet?

220
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,480
I want to know
who's he been talking with.

221
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,080
OK, come on. Give me the story.

222
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,600
Any demands? Any fingerprints?
Have we interviewed his staff?

223
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,160
Whitney, who is this?

224
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
Give me a copy of that.

225
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,800
James Carter, FBI.

226
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,560
Warren, he's here
for the special assignment.

227
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,200
I'm Agent-In-Charge Warren Russ.

228
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
It's good to have you onboard.

229
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,000
I waited a long time for this.

230
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,760
You guys sure take a long time
to process an application.

231
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,240
Well, Carter,
your particular assignment...

232
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,640
is considered G-14 classified.

233
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,920
Why don't you and I take a walk
and I'll fill you in?

234
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,160
OK, Warren.

235
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
G-14 classified.

236
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,000
That's good.

237
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,080
You don't understand.
This is my dream.

238
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm very excited
about working with the FBI.

239
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,880
I'm glad.
Listen, his name is Lee.

240
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,440
And the director considers
this a top priority.

241
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,160
No disrespect, but he's only
gonna get in my way.

242
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm not used
to having a partner.

243
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,440
If I'm handling the situation,
I'm gonna have to work alone.

244
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,680
Carter, he is the situation.

245
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,240
Must be a misunderstanding.

246
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
I was sent down here for
the kidnapping. Little girl?

247
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,680
Forget the little girl.
Your assignment is Lee.

248
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,880
Who and what kind of assignment
is that?

249
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,200
Lee is a foreign detective
and a friend of the consul's.

250
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,760
It's your job to keep him out
of sight and away from danger.

251
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Yeah, you want me to baby-sit,
but I don't do that.

252
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,840
I came down here
for the big assignment.

253
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,760
The truth is,
this is an FBI operation...

254
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,560
and I don't need help from LAPD
or some Chun-King cop.

255
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,040
You got it?

256
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
Whoa. Hold it.

257
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,760
Why not use your men
for this top-priority case?

258
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,080
What am I supposed to do,
take him to the zoo?

259
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,200
I don't give a damn.

260
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,920
I don't want to see him
or you till this is resolved.

261
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,320
Now, his plane arrives
in an hour.

262
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,880
We want to make
a good impression, Carter.

263
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,080
It's his first trip to America.

264
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,120
This is bullshit!

265
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,240
Please tell me
you speak English.

266
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm Detective Carter!

267
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,320
Do you speaka any English?

268
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,360
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

269
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
I cannot believe this shit!

270
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,960
First,
I get a bullshit assignment...

271
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
now, Mr. Rice-A-Roni...

272
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,800
don't even speak American.

273
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,840
Come on. My ride's over here.

274
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,920
Put your bag in the back.

275
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
Put your bag in the back!

276
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,400
No. You put your own shit
in the back!

277
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,320
I am not a skycap.

278
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm FBI, you understand?

279
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
What the hell you think this is?

280
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,800
Captain, I don't think
this is funny.

281
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,720
No, I'm serious, Captain.
I ain't playin'.

282
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,600
Tell the FBI you made a mistake.

283
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,120
I can't do that, Carter.

284
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm sure that you and Mr. Lee
will have a nice time together.

285
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,640
You better call the FBI or
I drop his ass at Panda Express.

286
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,720
Drop this case, you're suspended
for two months without pay.

287
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,720
Well, you can forget
about being mayor then.

288
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,360
Congratulations, Carter.

289
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,800
Looks like you finally
got yourself a partner.

290
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,800
One little pinkie get blowed off
and everybody trippin'.

291
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,360
Chinese consul?

292
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,560
That's one of the places
you can't go.

293
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,320
I ain't getting fired.
You gonna pay my bills?

294
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,440
That's the little girl?

295
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
Say something.

296
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,920
Y'all think this is real funny.

297
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,120
Give Carter
the big G-14 classified case.

298
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,040
Gonna show the FBI they don't
know who they playing with.

299
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,880
I'll solve this case myself.

300
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
That's right.

301
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,840
But I wanna show you something
first. Look familiar?

302
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,760
Just like home, ain't it?

303
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,040
I ain't never been to China,
but it probably look like this.

304
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,400
Get your star maps!

305
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,880
Look, John Wayne.

306
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,440
You know John Wayne?

307
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,600
John Wayne.

308
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,800
Yeah, John Wayne, man.
Hang out with the Duke.

309
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,240
I'll be right back.

310
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,000
You might see
one of your cousins here.

311
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,640
Find them and stalk 'em !

312
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,840
Star maps!

313
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,760
Right here! Star maps!

314
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,040
Stucky.

315
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,720
You got the address
to Michael Jackson's house?

316
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,120
You can't come around my job!
That's harassment!

317
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,320
I'm just checking up on you.

318
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,120
I'm fully legit now.
I'm selling star maps.

319
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,280
Yeah, legit my ass.

320
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,840
You and your Asian gang friends
know about a kidnapping?

321
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,280
I don't know nothing.

322
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,920
Give me one of them star maps...

323
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,800
for $45, you understand
what I'm saying?

324
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,240
Don't know nothin'
about no kidnapping...

325
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,600
but this dude's buying firearms,
explosives, and people...

326
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,200
Like he's gonna start a war.

327
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,120
What's his name?

328
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,920
For $45, I don't know his name.

329
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,760
-You better tell me something.
-I don't know nothing for $45.

330
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,840
Stucky, you don't--

331
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,120
I didn't tell you nothin'!

332
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,680
Didn't I tell you
to wait for me?

333
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,560
What the hell you doing
on this bus?

334
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,840
Think I'm playin' with you?

335
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,200
I ain't playin' with you.
Sit down.

336
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,800
OK. All right.

337
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,400
It's OK.

338
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
It's all right. FBI.

339
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,600
Take a picture. It's OK.
Wait a minute.

340
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,160
All right.

341
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,720
What?

342
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,040
Get out of my way!

343
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,040
FBI. Stop this bus.

344
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
Hey, look.

345
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,600
Hey, kids, get back in here.
Sit down.

346
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
Stop! FBI!
I need this motorcycle.

347
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,880
-No way, man.
-Get off!

348
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,040
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

349
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,480
Where you think you're going?

350
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
Didn't I say
to stay by the Duke?

351
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,920
What do you think you're doing?

352
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,280
Mind your own business.
Stay in the car.

353
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,840
Hey. What you doing?

354
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,280
I was trying to find out
where you was going.

355
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,680
You thought
I was gonna shoot you?

356
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,400
What's happening here?

357
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,000
Put the gun down.

358
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,840
I ain't playin' with you!

359
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,160
Think I'm playin' with you?

360
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
Don't move!

361
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,720
Drop your guns.

362
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,200
Hey, man.

363
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,000
Look. FBI.

364
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,440
I'm policeman.

365
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,480
I'm just showing him how
to take a gun from a suspect.

366
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,040
All of a sudden
you speaking English?

367
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,160
A little.

368
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,480
My ass. You lied to me.

369
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
I didn't say I didn't.
You assumed so.

370
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,800
Assume I kick you little
Beijing ass right now.

371
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,240
Man, I ain't scared of you.

372
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,680
I know you know
that tricky shit.

373
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,920
I'm not responsible
for your assumptions.

374
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,440
You full of shit,
you understand that?

375
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,680
Not being able to speak
is not the same as not speaking.

376
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
You seem as if you like to talk.

377
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,480
I let people talk
who like to talk.

378
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,040
It makes it easier to find out
how full of shit they are.

379
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,960
What the hell did you just say?

380
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,800
I like people to talk...

381
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,720
So I'm the one full of shit?

382
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,160
We both full of shit.

383
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
You full of shit.

384
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,280
I'm gonna kick your ass.

385
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,960
Don't nobody do that but me.

386
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,920
You want me to kick your ass,
don't you?

387
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
You must take me to see
Consul Han right away.

388
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,280
Just sit there and shut up.
This ain't no democracy.

389
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,080
-Yes, it is.
-No, it ain't.

390
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,960
This is the United States
of James Carter now.

391
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm the president,
I'm the emperor, I'm the king.

392
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito.

393
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,720
Your ass belong to me.

394
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,080
Why would they not want my help?

395
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,000
'Cause they don't give a damn
about you.

396
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,200
They don't like you.
I don't like you.

397
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,320
I don't care.
I'm here for the girl.

398
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,800
The girl don't like you.
Nobody likes you.

399
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,120
You came all the way
over here for nothing.

400
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
You ain't gonna be--

401
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
Beach Boys.

402
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,880
Oh, hell, no.

403
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,400
You didn't just touch
my goddamn radio.

404
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,720
The Beach Boys
are great American music.

405
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,120
The Beach Boys'll get you
a great ass-whoopin'.

406
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,360
Don't you ever touch
a black man's radio, boy.

407
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,960
You can do that in China...

408
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,360
but you'll get your ass
killed out here.

409
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,280
Let me show you real music.

410
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,640
That's real music.
You hear that?

411
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,480
Now can you do that
to the Beach Boys?

412
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,960
Hell no!

413
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,760
I must get to the consulate.
What are we doing here?

414
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,640
It's called a shakedown.
Very serious police work.

415
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,600
Just watch me handle my business
and patrol this place.

416
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,360
I want to help
with the investigation.

417
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,760
This is my case.

418
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,520
Your case?
Look, you can back me up.

419
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,880
When we get in here,
follow my lead and do what I do.

420
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,200
What's up, my nigger?

421
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,200
What's up?

422
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,640
Is this weed?

423
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,800
What?

424
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,920
You got a prescription for this?
Where is it?

425
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,280
Where is it?

426
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,400
Where?

427
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,720
Where?

428
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,000
Where? Where?

429
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,400
-I should take your ass to jail.
-For what?

430
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,520
For what? Look at this!

431
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,040
-That's nothing but a cigarette.
-This ciga-weed!

432
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,280
Well, it look like cigarette.

433
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,240
-You better have glaucoma.
-I do.

434
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,760
What's up, my nigger?

435
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,360
Hey, check that, baby.

436
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,960
What's happening, Carter?

437
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,160
Put the guns down!

438
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,240
M.C. Hammer there,
put the goddamn gun down.

439
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,320
Now, I got some questions,
and I need some answers.

440
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,560
Put 'em down.

441
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,000
Where the girl?
The little girl.

442
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,000
-What little girl?
-The little Chinese girl.

443
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,640
I don't know nothin'
about no Chinese girl.

444
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Don't act like you don't know.

445
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,160
I'll take your asses in
if I don't get answers.

446
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,720
Carter, put the gun down.

447
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Don't act like you know me.
You don't know me.

448
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,080
I see what's going on here.

449
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,000
Y'all trying to play me
like a fool.

450
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Lee, go outside real quick.

451
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,840
It's gonna get
a little dangerous in here.

452
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,920
I may have ques--

453
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,720
Lee, go and wait by the bar.

454
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,120
Remember what I told you?
Back me up.

455
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,400
I'll take care of everything.

456
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,480
You're sure?

457
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,960
I'm sure. Go on now.

458
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,720
Go on!

459
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,160
Think I'm playing?

460
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,760
Hurry up!

461
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,640
Come here.

462
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,360
Don't come in my business
scaring me like that.

463
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,280
I was just playin'.
Man, give me a hug.

464
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,360
Just schoolin' the rookie,
showing him the ropes.

465
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Why you didn't
come to church Sunday?

466
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,480
I had some things
to take care of.

467
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,400
But I made the night service.

468
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,800
Yeah. Come here,
I wanna holler at you.

469
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,960
What's up?

470
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,440
Who's this guy buying up
these explosives and weapons?

471
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't know nothing
about that.

472
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,640
Luke, I know what you do.

473
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,800
The only reason
why I ain't busted your ass...

474
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,120
'cause you my cousin,
and it'd kill Aunt Bootsy.

475
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,080
Why you gonna put
Aunt Bootsy in this?

476
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,360
Luke, I ain't playin'.

477
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,960
I know she got a bad heart,
but I will bust your ass.

478
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,520
Tell me something.

479
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,560
The word down in Chinatown is
there's this new dude in town.

480
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,520
Bad-ass dude outta Hong Kong
buying up every goddamn thing.

481
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,440
What's his name?

482
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Don't know.
He ain't buying shit from me.

483
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
-You don't know his name?
-No.

484
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,960
Don't nobody know his name.

485
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,400
What's up, my nigger?

486
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,240
What did you just say?

487
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
What's up, my nigger?

488
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,360
Come here!
You better watch your mouth!

489
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,520
What you say, boy?

490
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,200
I don't want trouble.

491
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,960
Please...

492
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,680
I said I don't want trouble.

493
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,040
That's bad for you.

494
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,480
-Where the little girl at?
-What little girl?

495
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,640
You know what girl
I'm talking about.

496
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,520
Man, you better take
your goddamn hands off my suit.

497
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,280
Your mama bought me this
for Christmas.

498
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,080
This is my favorite suit.

499
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,400
I'll see you Thanksgiving.
Appreciate it.

500
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,480
Get your big
Happy-Meal ass over!

501
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,920
Get over in the corner!

502
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,360
I'm still the law around here!

503
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,760
Next time I come here,
y'all better clean this up!

504
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,200
And brush your teeth!

505
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,160
Let's go.

506
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,280
-What are we doing here?
-I'm getting something to eat.

507
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,440
You want anything,
like a Cup O'Noodles?

508
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,440
Carter, stop wasting my time.
I made a promise to Soo Yung.

509
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,760
You're right.
I have been wasting your time.

510
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm sorry. Just let me
go get something to eat.

511
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,720
When I come back out, I'll take
you wherever you want to go.

512
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,920
Shake on it?

513
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,400
Hey, what are you doing?

514
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,160
You ain't the only one
with quick hands, are you?

515
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,760
I'll be right back.

516
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,400
Hey, man, I got you
a beef-and-bean burrito.

517
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,160
We have a taxicab approaching.

518
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,080
A man stepping out--Asian.
About 5'10".

519
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,840
We've got someone
approaching the gate.

520
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,160
Dropped off by a cab.

521
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,440
Tell them to intercept.

522
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,600
Intercept.

523
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,200
We will intercept.

524
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,840
Can I help you?

525
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,520
-Yes. I must see the consul.
-About what?

526
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,760
Please, it's very important.

527
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,760
Why don't you tell us
why you need to see the consul?

528
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,240
We'll tell you
whether it's important.

529
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Do you have identification?

530
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,160
It's about his daughter
Soo Yung.

531
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
Hands above your head!

532
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,960
He asked about
the consul's daughter.

533
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,080
He asked about the daughter.

534
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,880
You don't understand.
I was invited.

535
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,680
Don't move! Throw your gun away.

536
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,880
-He's gonna kill them.
-Is everything all right?

537
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,800
You'll be safer
on the second floor.

538
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,760
I'm sorry.

539
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,520
I'm sorry about this.

540
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,400
He went over.

541
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,520
Let's go!

542
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,120
He's on the grounds! Come on!

543
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,840
Stay away from the window,
please.

544
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,000
Right here.

545
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
Get down! Now!

546
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,080
Don't move!

547
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,640
I think there has been
a misunderstanding.

548
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,560
It's all right. It's OK.

549
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,200
It's him. The guy from China.

550
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,880
What?

551
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,680
Come in, please.

552
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,200
Mr. Russ, I would like you
to meet Detective inspector Lee.

553
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,040
Excuse me very much.

554
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,240
Your gun.

555
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,800
Where the hell is Carter?

556
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Then I gotta put up with this.

557
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,400
Seen a little Asian dude
about this height...

558
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,160
with a steering wheel
on his arm?

559
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,000
Go screw yourself.

560
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,840
What you say?

561
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,240
I said go screw yourself.

562
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,000
You take your sensitive ass
up there and let me in!

563
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,880
Don't make me get up
out of this truck!

564
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,120
Let this putz in.

565
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,560
Man, when I get up in here,
I'm slapping somebody.

566
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,640
What happened, Carter?

567
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
I ain't supposed to be
jumping on buses!

568
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,440
I do not do that!
I am not Carl Lewis!

569
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,120
Who is this man?

570
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,280
Sir, I can explain.

571
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,680
Agent Carter has been helping
with my investigation.

572
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,440
He's upset that we have not
done our job.

573
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,360
Me and Lee are taking care
of the situation.

574
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,520
We have everything
under control.

575
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,200
We'll get your daughter back
safe and sound.

576
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,880
He is very passionate
about finding your daughter.

577
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,080
Well, I owe you my gratitude.

578
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,440
We wanted Detective Lee to have
one of our best men by his side.

579
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,360
Agent Russ,
maybe this is a good time...

580
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,360
to tell him
the details of my assignment.

581
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,600
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

582
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,280
You wanna speak to me?
For a moment?

583
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,520
In private?

584
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,440
Oh, I see!
This must be G-14 classified.

585
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,920
FBI-type stuff.

586
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,560
Let me call my captain
and let him know what going on.

587
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,720
We'll talk in a second.
When a G-14 comes around.

588
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,880
Who's this? Hello?

589
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,840
Am I speaking with FBI?

590
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,640
-Give me the phone.
-Yeah, this is the FBI.

591
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,320
You are FBI?

592
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah, this is the FBI.

593
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,360
If you want the girl back alive,
listen and do not talk.

594
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,800
OK, I'm listening.
Let me get a pen.

595
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,200
All right. Cool.

596
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,400
The drop will be made tonight.
11:00 p.m.

597
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,800
The amount will be $50 million.

598
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,400
Fifty million dollars?

599
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,000
Who you think you kidnapped,
Chelsea Clinton?

600
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,240
Keep him talking.

601
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,640
In used currency.
Nothing bigger than a 50.

602
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,560
All right. Cool.
Fifty million. No problem.

603
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,720
I want 20 million in 50s...

604
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,160
Twenty million in 50s.

605
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,240
Twenty million in 20s...

606
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,720
Twenty million in 20s.

607
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,760
And 10 million in 10s.

608
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,520
Ten million in 10s.

609
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,280
You want any fries with that?

610
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,640
What is your name?

611
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,320
You called us.
Why you want to know my name?

612
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,200
I just want to be able to tell
the consul who is responsible...

613
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,480
for his daughter's death
because he talk too much.

614
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,400
All right, hold up. Calm down.

615
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,760
I'm trying to hook you up.
I'm on your side.

616
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
You will receive instructions
for the drop...

617
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,600
half an hour
before it is to be made.

618
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,600
If it is successful,
the girl will live.

619
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm gonna make sure
you get the money...

620
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,320
and we can spend it
together when you do...

621
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,480
'cause I don't even
really work for them.

622
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,320
We got it.
620 South Broadway. Downtown.

623
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,440
Team one, proceed down 6th
to 6th and Broadway.

624
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,800
Team two, I want you around
the back on 4th and Main.

625
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,240
Set up a perimeter.

626
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,080
Take your team and cover
the building floor by floor...

627
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,760
all the way to the top. Move.

628
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,120
Two men around back.

629
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,560
They must not go
into the building.

630
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,120
Yeah, you right.
Let's go tell them. Come on.

631
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,800
Take positions on the corner.

632
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,240
Mr. Russ, you must pull
your men back.

633
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,120
What the hell
are you doing here?

634
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,960
Where's Carter?

635
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,360
Please, listen to me.

636
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,760
You may be very competent,
but the mere fact...

637
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,760
that you know this girl
compromises your judgment.

638
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,280
Sir, if you were asking
for $50 million dollars...

639
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,920
would you be in a place
like that?

640
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,000
Get this clown away from me.

641
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,200
Take a hike!

642
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,640
Hey, man.

643
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,920
Why were you hiding?

644
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,440
What you talking about?
I wasn't hiding.

645
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,640
You were hiding.

646
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,600
I bent down to tie my shoe.

647
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,560
Sir, the area is secured.

648
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,200
Room's empty.

649
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,520
Damn it!

650
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,400
Everybody pull back!

651
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,560
Goddamn!

652
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Get some paramedics
down here now!

653
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,400
Evacuate the building
right away!

654
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,840
Get fire crews here!

655
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,560
We got an explosion
at 6th and Broadway.

656
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,240
That ain't far enough, man!

657
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,160
I ain't Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!
Push it down some more!

658
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,840
Carter, don't come any--Stop!

659
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,680
What the hell you--

660
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,520
I think I done broke my shit.

661
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
Who was that you was chasing?

662
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,480
His name is Sang from Hong Kong.
Because of you he got away.

663
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,680
Why you ain't tell me
about the bridge?

664
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,000
-I did.
-No, you didn't.

665
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,160
I said stop.

666
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,760
I don't understand
what you be saying.

667
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,360
What?

668
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,040
You see what I'm saying?

669
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,480
What's this in your hand?

670
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,320
He dropped it.

671
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,520
Oh, shit.

672
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,080
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

673
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,440
I messed up my suit.

674
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,400
Fifteen seconds.

675
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,040
Make a decision.

676
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,160
Oh, shit!

677
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,840
Did I come at a bad time?

678
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,120
I got bad news for you, Johnson.
We're all dead.

679
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,960
I was distracted, sir.

680
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,880
Distractions can occur
in the field.

681
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,720
That's why
we call this practice.

682
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,080
If you can't handle
the pressure, then quit.

683
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,240
Yes, sir.

684
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,960
Man, give her a break.
Don't worry about him.

685
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,800
How you doing, girl?
Give me some love.

686
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,400
Why are you tormenting me?

687
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,880
That any way to treat
an old friend?

688
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,920
I came to see how you was doing,
and I need some help.

689
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,680
Help?

690
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,840
I know that you have
strong feelings for me...

691
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,600
but we gotta put that aside.

692
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,200
It's a little girl's life
at stake here.

693
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,600
Since when do care about anybody
but yourself?

694
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,800
Please just take a look at this.

695
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,560
We found this on a kidnapper.
Tell me what this is.

696
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,760
You want me to work with you?
I don't have time for this.

697
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,560
I got enough shit to deal with.

698
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,760
Who are you?

699
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,200
-Sorry we got you in trouble.
-Yeah, he's sorry.

700
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,880
Tell me something
about this I don't know.

701
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,640
A remote. Could be nitro cap,
could be cross-delayed...

702
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,600
definitely not homemade,
definitely not American.

703
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,840
It could open up a garage door,
or blow up some C-4.

704
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,520
C-4?

705
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah, C-4.

706
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,240
This means so much to me.

707
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,080
Hey, and I'm sorry about
spreading all those rumors...

708
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,960
on Christmas about us
sleeping together.

709
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,200
What?!

710
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,640
He's just joking.

711
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,680
Hey, Bobby, what's up, man?

712
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,480
-I need to see Clive Cod.
-No way, Carter.

713
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,400
It's lights out.
They're locked down.

714
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,520
You want me to lose my job?

715
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,040
I got you this damn job.
You better let me in here.

716
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,360
Can't do it.

717
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,920
Didn't I turn my back when
you bought that bag of weed?

718
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,160
I was splitting it with you.

719
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,600
Didn't I give you
the bigger half?

720
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,520
Do me this favor.

721
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,520
Shit. You got five minutes.

722
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,280
Hey, Cod.

723
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,080
Your two brothers
are here to see you.

724
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,560
Clive, how you doing, man?

725
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,560
You got a lot of balls,
coming here.

726
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,480
I was just around the way.
Figured you would be bored.

727
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,680
I came to see how you was doing.

728
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,040
What the hell do you want?

729
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,680
I just came to bring you a gift.

730
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,760
I know you got time to kill.
I brought you a toy.

731
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,560
-I don't want that.
-You don't?

732
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,520
Somebody told me
you like this stuff.

733
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,480
I don't like stuff like that.
I don't even know what it is.

734
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,920
You never sold this to nobody?

735
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,040
How could l,
when I don't know what it is?

736
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,080
-Hold it.
-I don't want to hold it.

737
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,840
-Just touch it.
-I don't want to touch it.

738
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,000
-You scared of it?
-You think I'm stupid?

739
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,120
Stupid enough to get busted.

740
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,120
You want my fingerprints
so you can frame me.

741
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,640
Why would I do something
like that?

742
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,160
Think I would try
tricking you again?

743
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,720
I don't have to frame you.

744
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,160
You'll do life
for killing the little girl.

745
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,720
I don't know anything
about a little girl.

746
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,480
That ain't
what I'll tell everybody.

747
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,120
I don't know anything.

748
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,440
I got a big mouth, Clive.

749
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,600
Let me tell you something.

750
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,480
I don't know anything,
so you can kiss my fat ass.

751
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,840
It'd take me all day
to kiss your fat ass.

752
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,520
You want some of this?

753
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,160
I'll give you all you want.

754
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,680
Give me a name.

755
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,440
I ain't telling you shit.

756
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,760
She's only 11 years old.

757
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,960
I don't want her to die.

758
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,160
Look at the picture.

759
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,200
I don't care about him or you.

760
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,400
I care about the little girl.

761
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,520
Give me the name.

762
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,760
The guy's name is Juntao.

763
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,440
I never seen him.

764
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,720
Where can I find him?

765
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,600
Foo Chow Restaurant.
Chinatown.

766
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,800
Foo Chow Restaurant?

767
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,440
Get rid of this guy.
He'll get you killed.

768
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,000
Clive, thank you, man.
I'm gonna come back.

769
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,280
I'm gonna bring your fat ass
some cookies.

770
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,360
That's it right there.

771
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,000
What are we waiting for?

772
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,440
We scoping the place out, man.
Ain't gonna run up in there.

773
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,560
That's how you get shot.

774
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,200
I'm falling asleep.

775
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,680
Hunh yeah.

776
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,960
What is it good for?

777
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,480
Absolutely nothing.

778
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,920
Sing it again, you all.

779
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,320
War, hunh, yeah.

780
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,200
What is it good for?

781
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,680
Absolutely nothing.

782
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,240
Sing it again, you all.

783
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,360
War, hunh, yeah.

784
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,880
What is it good for?
Absolutely--

785
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,040
You don't know nothing
about no war.

786
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,560
Everybody knows war.

787
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,520
Hunh, yeah.

788
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,640
What is it good for?

789
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,120
Absolutely nothing.

790
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,280
Good God, you all.

791
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,560
It ain't you all, it's y'all.

792
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,320
Man, you sound
like a karate movie. Y'all!

793
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,200
Say it from right here
with some soul. Y'all.

794
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,680
Let me show your goofy ass
how to do this.

795
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,400
What is it good for?

796
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,000
Absolutely nothing.

797
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,320
Come on.

798
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,720
War, hunh, yeah.

799
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,680
What is it good for?

800
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,360
Absolutely nothing.

801
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,760
Listen to me.

802
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,640
War, hunh.

803
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,000
Come on, come on.

804
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,480
Do that again.

805
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,760
Do it again. Like this?

806
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,400
One will be inserted
into the suitcase.

807
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,320
The other will be on you.
Now when you make the drop--

808
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,360
Do we have it?

809
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,800
All right, pick it up.

810
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,320
You have what I asked for?

811
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,400
I do.

812
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,960
I hope now you realize
how serious I am.

813
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,560
Take the money to the alley...

814
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,000
behind the Foo Chow Restaurant
in Chinatown.

815
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,760
You have 29 minutes left.

816
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,920
Damn, Chen,
this is some greasy shit.

817
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,240
You ain't got no better food...

818
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,280
Like some chicken wings,
some baby back ribs...

819
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,000
some fries or something?

820
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,320
Chinese food, no soul food here.

821
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,840
I didn't say soul food.
I said better food.

822
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,000
I don't want that greasy shit.

823
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,320
How you gonna sell
a big box of grease?

824
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,520
I'm chilly a what?

825
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,960
Come on.

826
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,200
I'm no punk bitch.

827
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,560
I ain't no punk bitch neither.

828
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,640
-I'm no punk bitch.
-I'll knock your hat off.

829
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,760
Come on.

830
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,480
Man, what you got me eating?

831
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,720
That's eel.

832
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,920
Is it good?

833
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,240
Very good.

834
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,960
What you got?

835
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,280
Camel's hump.

836
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,520
What?

837
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,480
Camel's hump.

838
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,280
Kinda good.

839
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,960
Need a little hot sauce,
but it's kinda good, though.

840
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,680
-We still waiting?
-Yeah.

841
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,440
How we gonna get Juntao?

842
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,880
How we know he exists?
Ain't nobody seen him.

843
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,200
I know. He killed my partner.

844
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm sorry about that, man.

845
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,920
That's one reason
I don't have no partner.

846
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,480
That's one thing
I learned from my daddy.

847
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,880
Your daddy was a policeman?

848
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,640
Fifteen years LAPD.

849
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,800
My father was also a policeman.

850
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,920
Your daddy was a cop?

851
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,440
Not a cop, an officer.

852
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,240
A legend all over Hong Kong.

853
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,280
My daddy a legend, too.
All over America.

854
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,400
My daddy once arrested 15 people
in one night by himself.

855
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,280
My daddy arrest 25 by himself.

856
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,720
My daddy
saved five crackheads...

857
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,440
from a burning building
by himself.

858
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,160
My daddy once caught a bullet
with his bare hands.

859
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,080
My daddy'll kick
your daddy's ass...

860
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,720
all the way from here
to China...

861
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,120
or Japan or wherever you from.

862
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,680
All up that Great Wall, too.

863
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,040
-Don't talk about my father.
-Don't talk about my daddy.

864
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,080
Hey, that your boy?

865
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,520
Yes. Let's go.

866
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,280
I better go in first.
Ain't nobody gonna recognize me.

867
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,200
I'll wait five minutes.

868
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,640
Hey, you take my ID.

869
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,960
If anything go wrong,
you bust in like you're LAPD.

870
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,720
This won't work. I'm not 6'1".

871
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,840
Yes, it will work.
It's all about attitude.

872
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,320
Flip it open, flip it closed.

873
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,320
Do it fast. Open, close. Fast.

874
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,680
You'll get it. Look.

875
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,480
Take this.

876
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,800
Hey, man, act like
you're from out of town.

877
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,560
I am from out of town.

878
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,760
Don't act like a cop.
Act like a tourist.

879
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,120
Don't be so obvious. All right.

880
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,760
OK, no problem.

881
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,920
-Hi.
-How you doing?

882
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,840
-For one?
-No, for two.

883
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,760
I'm here for a meeting
with Mr. Juntao.

884
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,720
I'm sorry,
I don't know Mr. Juntao.

885
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,960
Maybe you don't understand.

886
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,680
I'm Mr. Juntao's lawyer.
Legal advisor.

887
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,640
He got into some shit again.
I'm a very busy man.

888
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,080
I ain't got time
to be coming down here.

889
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,560
My wife wants me to come home,
baby's shitting all over.

890
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,960
Would you please get Mr. Juntao?

891
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,400
But I have already told you
I don't know--

892
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,120
You think I came here
for nothing?

893
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,560
You gonna give me gas money?

894
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,960
You got $5.00 on you?

895
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,760
Would you please go tell
Mr. Juntao to get his ass here?

896
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,240
Thank you.

897
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,400
Can I sit right here?

898
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,240
Right here? Thank you.

899
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,760
-Hi.
-Y'all got any eel?

900
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,000
Sure.

901
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,760
How's your camel hump?

902
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,480
Excuse me?

903
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,280
Where is Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles?

904
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,200
This way?

905
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,400
I'm sorry.
I'm from out of town.

906
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,600
Thank you.

907
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,480
Welcome.

908
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,880
What's that?

909
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,800
No, wait.

910
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,680
Get the girl out of here.

911
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,000
Make sure those two don't leave.

912
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,320
Juntao will see you.

913
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,600
It's about time.

914
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,200
Stop it!

915
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,000
Let me go!

916
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,400
This is tight.
Ain't nothing like downstairs.

917
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,880
Y'all got it going--

918
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,080
What's up, man?
What y'all watching?

919
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,480
Where Juntao at?

920
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,760
Why y'all so quiet?

921
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,360
That was childish, man.

922
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,000
That wasn't even called for!

923
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,280
Now I came down here
to see Juntao...

924
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,000
'cause he told me
to come down here...

925
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,600
'cause I'm his half-brother
from Beijing.

926
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,920
Me and him got the same mama.
I'm Blackinese.

927
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,360
We all the same. Whoa.
Wait a minute.

928
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,040
OK, you gonna kill me?

929
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,880
OK, put the gun down,
fight me like a man.

930
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,160
That's right,
fight me like a man. Shit!

931
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,520
Anybody can shoot somebody.
That's what I'm talking about.

932
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,480
Back. Give me some room.

933
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,240
You don't know
who you messing with.

934
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,400
I'm gonna knock that yellow--

935
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,040
Which one of y'all kicked me?

936
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,760
Me.

937
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,440
OK. All right.

938
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,640
Hold on. Let's talk about this.

939
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,200
Let's talk about this, man.

940
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,200
No, no. What that mean?

941
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,480
Hey, man,
this is a misunderstanding.

942
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,000
Come on, let's pray about this.

943
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,440
FBI, huh?

944
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,880
No, I ain't FBI.

945
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,120
I'm a security guard,
I work at the mall.

946
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,640
Now wipe yourself off.

947
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,840
You're bleeding.

948
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,160
Oh, hell naw.

949
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,320
He just playing, man.
He ain't mean that.

950
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,080
He meant cut me loose.
Let me go.

951
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,720
No, no!

952
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,880
LAPD.

953
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,920
What you doing?

954
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,160
Watch out!

955
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,400
Behind you.

956
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,800
Freeze!

957
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,840
We kicked y'all ass.

958
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,320
All y'all.

959
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,960
Y'all got your ass kicked.

960
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,640
Oh, shit.

961
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,000
Hey, man!

962
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,040
I'm gonna kill your ass.

963
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,960
Lee! Over here, man!

964
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,440
Move! Move!

965
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,560
Is that my gun?

966
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,280
-It is my gun.
-Let's go.

967
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,320
Why you gotta drop
the goddamn badge?

968
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,400
Then you threw the gun
out the window.

969
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,640
Come on, this way.

970
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,320
I got everything under control.
Don't worry about nothing.

971
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,720
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

972
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,840
It's cool.

973
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,000
Why am I not surprised
to find you here, Carter?

974
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,000
Dan, I want these two back
at the consulate immediately.

975
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,520
Let's take a ride, gentlemen.

976
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,720
You better get your hand off me.
Hey, man, he with me.

977
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,160
Just let me explain.
I'll start from the top.

978
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,560
We were making the drop.
Han was about to get her back...

979
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,400
and you two screwed it up.

980
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,880
What you talking about?
Didn't you hear what Lee said?

981
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,640
Mr. Lee is on his way
to Hong Kong.

982
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,600
Now get out of here
before I file...

983
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,720
obstruction of justice charges
against you.

984
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,920
We was about to solve the case.
All we need to do--

985
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,520
You're no longer
on this assignment, Carter.

986
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,040
Case closed.

987
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,960
-Consul Han!
-Sorry, sir.

988
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,080
It was all my fault.

989
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,360
Lee would never do anything to
jeopardize your daughter's life.

990
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,960
He loves your daughter.

991
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,080
It's a little too late
for apologies.

992
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,560
Consul...you have a call.

993
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,160
We're ready.

994
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,560
OK, pick it up.

995
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,560
The ransom is now 70 million.
I will call with instructions.

996
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,440
You deliver the money or pick up
the body of your daughter.

997
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,760
Please. You must understand.
What happened tonight was not--

998
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:10,080
Soo Yung, please tell them
I will do whatever--

999
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,120
Sorry, man.

1000
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,080
Be sorry for Soo Yung.

1001
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,200
No hard leads.

1002
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,320
None.

1003
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,840
Listen, we're doing
all we can here, all right?

1004
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,320
Tracing everything that's coming
into this compound.

1005
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,600
Excuse me, Consul.
You have a guest.

1006
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,680
Jack, let me get back to you.

1007
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,560
Thomas.

1008
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,120
I'm sorry, my friend.

1009
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,400
I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

1010
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,760
Hey! What's up, baby?

1011
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,640
Man, you got guts calling me.
I'm gonna hang up.

1012
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,440
Hey, wait a minute.

1013
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,240
Don't hang up.
Look, you know what?

1014
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,960
You was right about me,
all right? I'm sorry.

1015
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
-Are you on drugs?
-You was right.

1016
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,320
I was egotistic.
I was inconsiderate.

1017
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,800
-I was self-centered.
-Yeah.

1018
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,760
I ain't used to working
with partners...

1019
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,800
but it ain't about me.
It's the little girl.

1020
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,280
She gonna die without our help.

1021
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,520
You understand what I'm saying?

1022
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,200
Not yet, but keep talking.

1023
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,480
I think something big going down
tonight, all right?

1024
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,600
I need to know
where the consul's gonna be.

1025
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,720
You think you can help me?

1026
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,640
I'll see what I can do.

1027
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,280
No. I don't need you to see.
I need you to do it.

1028
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,040
Can you do it?

1029
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,480
OK, Carter.

1030
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,080
-All right, one other thing.
-Yeah?

1031
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,040
What color panties you got on?

1032
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,640
Consul Han, I want you to go...

1033
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,560
to the Chinese expo
as you planned.

1034
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,840
Have the money
in the upstairs control room.

1035
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,760
Be sure to make no more mistake.

1036
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,000
I understand, but I want
to speak with my daughter!

1037
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,520
Excuse me, miss.
Who's the captain on this plane?

1038
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,240
Look, it don't even matter.
You need to go up there...

1039
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,880
tell the captain we got
a problem on the left side.

1040
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,240
Something wrong with the engine.
You need a new alternator.

1041
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,160
My supervisor said,
"Willy, go on down there...

1042
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,760
"and fix that plane.
Put the alternator on.

1043
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,520
"Don't let it leave
till I come down there."

1044
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,400
I suggest you tell
the proper authorities...

1045
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,000
not to move this plane
before the FAA comes here...

1046
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,000
and we all in some shit. Go on!

1047
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,680
What are you doing here?

1048
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,040
Now get your ass up.
We got work to do.

1049
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,080
Go away. I've disgraced myself.

1050
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,800
Lee, what about the little girl?

1051
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,760
Leave me alone. A man like you
could never understand.

1052
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,560
-A man like me?
-Devoted only to yourself.

1053
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,520
You're ashamed of being
a police officer.

1054
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,040
You dishonor your father's name.

1055
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,840
You don't know nothing
about my father.

1056
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,400
You say your father is a legend.

1057
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,320
My father was a legend.

1058
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,480
He was killed making a routine
traffic stop in daylight...

1059
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,360
by some punk
who didn't want no ticket...

1060
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,560
when his partner supposed
to get out of the car...

1061
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,920
and back him up, he didn't.

1062
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,520
My father was as devoted as you,
and now he's dead.

1063
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,440
And for what?
A traffic ticket and some punk?

1064
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,920
You tell me,
what's the honor in that?

1065
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,840
You believe your father
wasted his life...

1066
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,200
died for nothing?

1067
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,440
Prove me wrong.

1068
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,600
For 15 years until China
resumed control of Hong Kong...

1069
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,360
Juntao was the most powerful
crime lord in Southeast Asia.

1070
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,480
The British tried to close down
his operation, but we failed.

1071
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,560
But why the consul's daughter?

1072
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,160
Detective inspector Lee
helped me raid...

1073
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,920
every known asset
of Juntao's operation.

1074
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,920
We confiscated millions
in weapons and cash...

1075
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,160
and a collection of Chinese art
unsurpassed in the world.

1076
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,760
Then Juntao disappeared.
No witnesses.

1077
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,640
Do you really think
he'll kill the girl?

1078
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,200
My advice to you is...
pay the money.

1079
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,720
Consul, I'm going upstairs
to make the drop.

1080
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,920
I want you to remain calm
as if nothing's wrong...

1081
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,880
and don't leave Agent Whitney's
side even for a moment.

1082
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,520
I understand.

1083
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,360
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1084
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,280
I'm am Consul Han.

1085
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,840
On behalf of the People's
Republic of China...

1086
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,160
thank you for coming.

1087
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,360
I am pleased to present...

1088
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,880
5,000 years of Chinese history
and heritage...

1089
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,280
a collection which,
until recently...

1090
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,200
was thought to be lost forever.

1091
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,760
This some nice shit.

1092
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,760
That Buddha'd go good
in my bathroom.

1093
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,240
Hey. This is the history
of my country....

1094
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,200
priceless pieces
of Chinese culture.

1095
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,240
If anything gets damaged...

1096
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,840
Ain't nothing gonna happen
to none of this stuff.

1097
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,800
And now we can pass them on
to our children.

1098
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,200
Pardon me.

1099
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,880
I seen that guy
at that Chinese restaurant.

1100
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,080
Consul Han has been fighting flu
for the past few days...

1101
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,360
so perhaps I should finish
what he started.

1102
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,520
The first thing we gotta do
is clear out this riffraff.

1103
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,760
If anybody stay behind,
they got something to lose.

1104
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,400
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

1105
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,560
...future between
our two countries.

1106
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,120
The more we see
the differences...

1107
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,240
Hey!

1108
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,360
And similarities--

1109
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,920
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen!

1110
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,040
Goddamn it.

1111
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,640
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD!

1112
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,000
Russ, we got Carter down here.

1113
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,760
What the hell's going on
down there?

1114
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,040
We have just received
a threat on the building.

1115
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,040
We ask that you please exit
the building...

1116
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,640
as soon as possible,
and please do not panic.

1117
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,760
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get your shit and go out!

1118
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,480
Get the hell out!
There's a bomb in the building!

1119
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,440
I don't believe this.
Agents, hold your positions!

1120
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,280
Everybody take care,
but hold your positions.

1121
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,400
What's going on?

1122
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,880
Get your old ass
out the building!

1123
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,680
Lady, put the glass down
and get out of here!

1124
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,920
Woman, the exit over there.
Gonna get your head blowed off!

1125
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,520
Come on, come on!

1126
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,840
Titty, titty, titty.
Get them titties outta here.

1127
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,040
Will somebody grab Carter?

1128
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,640
Consul Han, six blocks of C-4
are wired to your daughter...

1129
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,120
in a car outside.

1130
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,480
Before the changeover,
most of this exhibition...

1131
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,520
was in the hands
of a single private collector...

1132
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,920
Me.

1133
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,720
I worked most of my life
to acquire and catalog...

1134
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,400
these priceless pieces
that you see before you.

1135
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,440
And then, in one fell swoop...

1136
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,400
it was taken away from me.

1137
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,960
But tonight,
I shall be paid in full.

1138
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,920
Don't move!

1139
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,320
She dies if I press this button.

1140
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,400
Just be patient.

1141
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,000
My transportation
will be here shortly.

1142
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,040
Stay calm.

1143
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,040
I was just gonna tell you
you was in a red zone.

1144
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,200
There's cops all over--

1145
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,800
You didn't know I could do that.
Put your hands up!

1146
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,560
I ain't gonna kill you
this time.

1147
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,240
I'm just gonna kick your ass!

1148
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,840
You tell your friends about me.

1149
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,480
Hey, how you doing?

1150
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,960
We've been looking for you.

1151
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,680
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD.

1152
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,720
Everything is OK now.
I'll take you to your daddy.

1153
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,000
And first thing I'm gonna do
is take this vest off you.

1154
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,080
Don't touch it!

1155
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,880
I think it'll be safer
if we take it off.

1156
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,120
No. I heard them say
it will explode.

1157
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,960
I think it'll be safer
if we leave it on, OK?

1158
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,480
Don't--don't move.

1159
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,720
Where are you?

1160
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,040
Don't move!

1161
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,560
Hold your positions, goddamn it!

1162
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,680
Do not draw your weapons.

1163
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,400
Ladies and gentlemen...

1164
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,880
I think we'll call that
an evening.

1165
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,320
Thank you and good night.

1166
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,000
I got something for you!

1167
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,120
Got something you want.

1168
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,880
I got your bomb right here.

1169
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,520
Want to blow something up?

1170
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,800
Come on.

1171
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,080
Push the button. Come on.

1172
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,920
Push the button.

1173
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,720
-What are you doing?
-Play along.

1174
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,360
Come on, push the button.

1175
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,040
Yeah, come on, push the button.

1176
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,120
Blow everybody up.

1177
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,880
Yeah, blow everybody up!

1178
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,760
Push the goddamn button!

1179
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,080
You heard what she said.

1180
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,240
You got everybody excited about
something being blowed up...

1181
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,680
and look at your
little punk British ass.

1182
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,520
Come on! Push the button!

1183
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,480
Deal with it, please.

1184
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,920
Where you going?

1185
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,080
Cover the consul!

1186
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,520
It's OK. She's a professional.

1187
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,280
You must take the vest off.

1188
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,520
Just give me a second.

1189
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,360
There's a trigger on this vest.

1190
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,640
It'll blow if I take it off.

1191
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,040
Haven't you done this before?

1192
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,480
It's a little different
in the practice room.

1193
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,720
Everybody take cover.

1194
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,320
We need more men down here.

1195
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,920
Say again. Dan, do you read--

1196
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,320
Need some help down here,
damn it!

1197
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,080
Roses are red...

1198
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,520
violets are blue.

1199
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,640
Sugar is sweet...

1200
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,400
and so are you.

1201
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,640
The remote can still set it off.

1202
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,520
Get rid of it.

1203
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,680
-She OK?
-Yes.

1204
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,680
I know that ain't the bomb!

1205
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,360
Get that bomb away from me!

1206
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,440
Take the bomb outside!

1207
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,680
Yeah, take it over to Juntao.

1208
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,880
You go that way,
I go that way. Go!

1209
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,960
Don't shoot!

1210
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,400
Shit!

1211
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,120
Where are you going?

1212
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,840
Meet me on the roof.

1213
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,400
Roger.

1214
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,600
Don't move, man!

1215
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:26,360
Yeah, I been looking for your
sweet-and-sour chicken ass.

1216
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,600
Your boys ain't here now.
You all alone.

1217
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,600
I kill him.

1218
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,080
Go ahead. I don't even like him.

1219
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
Put your gun down.

1220
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,760
Fight like a man.

1221
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,120
What you say?

1222
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,600
Fight like a man.

1223
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,040
Fight like a man?

1224
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,840
All right,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1225
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,160
Then I'm gonna
take your ass to jail.

1226
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,200
All right, come on,
put the gun down...

1227
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,520
same time.

1228
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,440
Wipe yourself off, man.
You're dead.

1229
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,320
Thank you, God.

1230
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,320
Oh, shit.

1231
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,160
You know he dead.

1232
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,600
Help! Do something!

1233
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,200
Hey, be cool, man!

1234
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,640
Hang on!

1235
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,920
I can't hold on anymore!

1236
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,800
Hang on for about an hour.
I'm gonna get the ambulance.

1237
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,480
-What are you doing?
-I'll be right back.

1238
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,840
-Carter!
-I was just playing.

1239
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,960
Do something!

1240
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,200
I can't hold on anymore!

1241
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,520
Oh, shit!

1242
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,960
Thank you! Thank you!

1243
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,800
-What the hell you doing?
-I was just being polite.

1244
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,360
Well, next time,
be polite to my nuts.

1245
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,280
I'm sorry.

1246
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,200
Thank you.

1247
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,840
Shit!

1248
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,600
Are you all right?

1249
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,960
I'm fine.

1250
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,640
-I owe you everything.
-Only your friendship.

1251
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,160
Look who's here.

1252
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,080
What took you so long?

1253
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,240
I think this belongs to you.

1254
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,880
I think you should come with me.

1255
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,960
Get on the plane
when you get off work.

1256
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,920
You fly for free.

1257
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,440
I'm just trying
to expand my horizons.

1258
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,480
Travel a little bit.
See the world.

1259
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,400
I'm through with y'all, man.
I'm going on vacation.

1260
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,360
Now, hold on there.
We were just coming by...

1261
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,280
to tell you what a great job
you did yesterday.

1262
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,240
And when you come back...

1263
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,520
there's gonna be
an FBI badge waiting for you.

1264
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,080
You serious?

1265
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,640
-Come on, don't be playing.
-No.

1266
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,600
I don't know what to say.
It's like a dream come true.

1267
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,600
I got an idea, though.

1268
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:05,680
Why don't y'all
take that badge...

1269
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,560
and shove it up your ass?

1270
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,920
All up in your ass. I'm LAPD.

1271
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,440
Bitch.

1272
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,680
First class. I like this.
This is tight.

1273
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,080
Can I take your jacket, sir?

1274
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,960
My jacket? No.
You can take this bag, though.

1275
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,880
How you doing? What's up?

1276
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,320
What's up, man?

1277
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,760
-You ready to go?
-Yep.

1278
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,200
May I offer you some peanuts?

1279
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,960
You never told me
you spoke Chinese.

1280
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,320
I never told you I didn't.
You assumed I didn't.

1281
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,280
This is cool. Han's letting me
go to Hong Kong with you.

1282
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,440
I ain't been on no vacation
in five years?

1283
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,440
We can hang in my crib.
I will show you my hood.

1284
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,720
No, you can show me a couple
of them Chinese girls.

1285
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,120
I want a massage.
I'm gonna get buck wild.

1286
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:59,400
No police work for two weeks?
How long this flight?

1287
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,000
-Fifteen hours.
-Fifteen hours?

1288
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,280
What are we gonna do
for 15 hours?

1289
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,600
War...

1290
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,720
Oh, hell, no! Stewardess!

1291
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,640
What is it good for?

1292
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:16,800
Stewardess, get me another seat!

1293
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,320
Nothing...Listen to me, y'all!

1294
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,480
Stewardess!

1295
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,800
Action!

1296
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,600
It broke.

1297
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,880
Don't move! Don't smile!

1298
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,920
What is this shit
about your daughter?

1299
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,040
Fifty million dollars?

1300
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,880
Who you think you got,
Kelsey Clinton?

1301
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,000
Fifty million dollars?

1302
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,480
Who you think you got,
Kelsey--What's the line?

1303
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,600
Fifty million dollars?

1304
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,760
Who you think you got--
Is it Chelsea or Kelsey?

1305
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,880
Fifty million dollars?

1306
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,280
Who you think you got,
Chelsea Carter?

1307
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,520
Fifty million dollars?

1308
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:12,400
Who you think you got,
Chelsea Grammer--Chelsea--

1309
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,280
Who do you think you got,
Chelsea Clinton?

1310
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,360
Fifty million dollars?

1311
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,400
Who you think you got,
Chelsea Clinton?

1312
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,680
Keep him talking--

1313
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,600
Cut! Go back to the beginning.

1314
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,720
Was that it, Chelsea--
Did I get it?

1315
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,560
Action!

1316
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,520
All right, let me
see your badge, buddy!

1317
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,920
No joke! Show your ass!

1318
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:57,400
Show your ass? Y'all scared--

1319
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,560
Cut!

1320
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,360
You know that other stuff,
but don't know his name?

1321
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,280
Man, people tell me shit.

1322
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,520
What's wrong with you?

1323
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,320
My daddy once caught--
catch a bullet--

1324
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,160
caught a bullet--
catch a bullet--

1325
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,280
caught a bullet.

1326
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,720
My daddy one caught a bullet
by his bare hand.

1327
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,360
No bullshit.

1328
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,600
What's the honor in that?

1329
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,520
You believe your father
wasting his life...

1330
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,440
They must not--

1331
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,400
You're right, man.
Let's go tell them.

1332
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,080
Anything goes wrong...

1333
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,920
you bust in there,
act like you're LA--

1334
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,640
He cannot speak English.

1335
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:46,480
Man, this is cool.
Han sending us to Hong Kong.

1336
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,000
What's that line?

1337
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,600
May I offer you some peanuts?

1338
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:09,120
See, how difficult is that?
My English?

1339
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,160
He even cannot say three words,
Chinese.

1340
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,480
You need some lunch?

1341
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,400
I got it before, Jackie.

1342
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,200
See? Now you know
how difficult I am.

1343
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,720
Look at Jackie.
