Now, Sergeant, I'd like
you to tell me once again...

about your violent urges.

42
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,455
Uh, I must insist
that you extinguish that.

43
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:34,253
And you'll do what,
exactly, if I don't?
Arrest me?

44
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,127
I'm not sure you realize
the gravity of your situation.

45
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,678
Nice pen.

00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,970
Sergeant?

47
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,797
Nice pen, I said.

00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,928
Says a lot about you.

49
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,681
Oh, is that so?
Pray tell.

50
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:55,311
You like a solid phallic
symbol between your fingers.

51
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,986
Sergeant Brant,
in the last year...

52
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,606
you've been
charged with bugging
the Superintendent's office...

53
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,317
beating a felon unconscious
in a billiards hall...

54
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,246
and just last week
you assaulted three
innocent youths...

55
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,574
with a hockey stick.
Shall I go on?

56
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,163
My report will be a
major factor in whether
you remain in the force.

57
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,507
Ser-- Sergeant Brant,
sit down.

58
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,928
The thing is, Doc...

59
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:38,768
this is the only work l
can do, and if I get bounced...

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,358
I'm sure I'll do
something truly reckless.

61
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,361
[incidental music]

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,783

You got a
minute for me?

66
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,015
Yeah. What is it?

67
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,301
I don't know.

68
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,806
I thought two years
undercover on the Drug Squad
would help me out, but...

69
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,391
I don't know.

70
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,770
I thought maybe my past
went against me or...

71
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,065
I failed the
Sergeant’s exam.

72
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,820
Everyone fails
the first time.

73
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,448
Did you?

74
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,370

Now you've only
been out of rehab a few
months. Give it time.

Falls, go grab
some piss poor tea
in the canteen, okay?

76
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,719
[scoffs]
You don't wanna
believe what you read
in the papers, sir.

77
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,051
It's not
what this station
needs right now.

78
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,603
You know we can't afford
any more bad publicity.

79
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,148
Imagine you walk
down the street...

80
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,606
and you bump into
three blokes carrying
carpeting knives.

81
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,819
Nah, they're not
carpet fitters.
They're after your wallet.

82
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,824
Maybe even that gold watch...

83
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,032
that you got for the highest
arrest rate in the Southeast.

84
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,502
One of the rats there even
very kindly offered to carve
their name in your face.

85
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,374
Now, would you be more
worried about whether
you're gonna have a fight...

86
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,048
than how it looks in the papers?

87
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,634
Well, just keep a
low profile until this
little shit storm blows over.

88
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,991
Business is brisk.

89
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,907
Have that, Daniel.

go through with this.

You'll be okay.
It'll be over
in no time.

You think I should've
gone for a burial?

No.

Who got
the flowers?

98
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,904
Owner of a stall
in Streatham owed
me a favor.

00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,195
and temporary head
of the inquiry.

179
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,618
(officer)
Sir?

180
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,445
(Superintendent)
Yes?

181
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,997
Shouldn't we promote
one of our own?
[all laugh]

182
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,996
(Superintendent)
Now, now gents.
I don 't need
to remind you...

183
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,624
that we're already
the focus of a media circus.

184
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,840
Sergeant Nash comes to us
from the prestigious
West London branch...

185
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,920
and it is my opinion that
he will instill a level
of professionalism...

186
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,382
hitherto lacking
in our primitive
Southeast Division.

187
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,180
[incidental music]

188
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,937
[suspenseful music]

189
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,615
[vacuum cleaner]

190
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,196
[knocking on door]

191
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,573
[suspenseful music continues]

192
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,038
I'm coming in.

193
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,088
You look like shit.

194
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,257
Take that hood
off your head.

195
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,925
I'm in trouble.

196
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,173
You got
any beers
or anything?

197
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,925
You know I haven't.

198
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,972
Sit down.

199
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,846
Talk.

200
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,348
[panting]
Well, me, Macky and Bowes were

201
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:21,354
What? Looking for a madness?

202
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,776
I think we killed someone.

203
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,607
Some camel jockey.

204
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,314
Sorry, I mean
an Indian guy.

205
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,401
He weren't moving.
[panting]

206
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,990
Okay.

207
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,996
Okay, I'll look into it.

208
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,577
Thank you--

209
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,378
Shut up.
I ain't finished yet.

210
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,170
If he's dead,
you're on your own.

211
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,219
Yeah? In fact, I’ll
come round your yard
and nick you myself.

212
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,345
Now you go home
and you wait till
you hear from me.

213
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,262
It's choice time, John.
If he lives...

214
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,020
you either quit that gang
or you quit coming round
here, you understand?

215
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,066
Yeah.

216
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,393
Yeah, what?

217
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,320
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,901
[walla]

219
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,953
(Falls)
Brant, can l
have a word?

220
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,828
I just need to
have a quick chat.

221
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,963
(Brant)
So what can l
do for you?

222
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,384
[clears throat]
I need a favor.

223
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:35,598
A friend of mine is in trouble.
I need to get him off the hook.

224
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,141
Someone you're riding?

225
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,937
What?
No, nothing like that.

226
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,098
He's a kid.

227
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,683
There's a DI.
I used to know him
from way back.

228
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,190
We shared a snitch in Brixton.
He'll be able to help.

229
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,361
Name?

230
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,316
Stokes. Craig Stokes.

231
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,741
Thank you.

232
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,989
Now you owe me one.

233
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,412
[street noise]

234
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:05,041
[phone ringing]

235
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,213
Harold Dunlop.

236
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,666
(man over phone)
I read your stuff
in the papers.

237
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,251
I've got some information
on the police killings.

238
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,678
All rig ht.
Hang on.

239
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,312
All right. Fire away.

240
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,310
Aw, have some
fucking manners.

241
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,643
I'm offering you information.
You don't even say hello.

242
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,979
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.
Is that better?

243
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,189
I detest sarcasm.

244
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:38,195
Maybe I'll start
on journalists when
I've finished my cop quota.

245
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,371
[suspenseful music]

246
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,244
Oh, uh, heh...

247
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,041
Listen fellow.

248
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,494
You and me got off to
the wrong start, didn't we?

249
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,204
So let's try again now.

250
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,085
What's your name?

251
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,417
Oh, Christ. I'm not sure
you're even up to the task.

252
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,134
(Dunlop)
What task?

253
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,389
Reporting from inside
the police killings?

254
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,100
[suspenseful music]

255
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,805
(man over phone)
Where are you on
the food chain?
You got any clout?

256
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,399
(Dunlop)
Well, I'm a staff writer
in the crime department, yeah.

257
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,771
(man)
I can make you famous.

258
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,652
(man)
Yo there, copper!
Remember me?

259
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,656
Do you want something?

260
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,612
Thing.

261
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,243
What?

262
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,116
It's 'something'
not somethink. '

263
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,698
You should at least
be able to speak properly.

264
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,499
Look, get lost mate, yeah?

265
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,202
I've got a question, yeah?
What would you do...

266
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,130
if I was
to call you a cunt?

267
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,129
(man over phone)
Which do you prefer?
Seven or eight?

268
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,676
Eight.

269
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,628
Eight it is.
[suspenseful music]

270
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,509
Hang on. What?
Eight what?

271
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,052
Eight more coppers
to kill. Bye.

272
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,102
What--

273
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,055
[suspenseful
music intensifies]

274
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,596
Cup of tea
and a biscuit.

275
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,773
Are you as black
as you're painted?

276
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,226
Are you as Nancy
as they say?

277
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,354
Thing is, Brant,
if there's a problem,
I'm gonna need to know about it.

278
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,360
There's a problem, all right.

279
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,158
Some sick fuck
is killing policemen...

280
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,702
and he's only just started.

281
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,495
I meant between us.

282
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,199
I know what you meant.

283
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:53,501
Problem?
Not unless you
follow me into public toilets.

284
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,379
So I don't get to be
head boy. Big fucking deal.

285
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,502
Less paperwork for me.

286
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,133
[incidental music]

287
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,264
(officer)
There's nothing, sir.

288
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,757
(Nash)
See if you
can get me a possible
match of the bullet.

289
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,308
(officer)
Yes, sir.

290
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,228
(female officer)
[indistinct]

291
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,397
(Nash)
Just keep it open
for me, for now.

292
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:16,189
Move your right and take your
fucking left hand up and over.

293
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,066
[indistinct]

294
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,694
Aw, fuck me.
Not you again, mate.

295
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,532
(Brant)
I'll keep coming back
until you get me
a knife.

296
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,201
Keep your
right hand up.
I keep telling ya.

297
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,903
You're getting
caught with your
left up.

298
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,410
(man)
No, that's not him.

299
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,991
(woman)
[indistinct]

300
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,329
Yeah, please.
That's quite important.

301
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,418
Want me to widen
the area for questioning?

302
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,632
Great, yeah.
Great idea.

303
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,334
(woman)
The gun was a
9mm semi-automatic.

304
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,169
A SIG or a Glock?

305
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,925
(Nash)
I'll go on
to forensics now.

306
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,222
No?

307
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,674
(man)
I don't fucking know.

308
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,100
I don't know!

309
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,973
I wanna know
the name

310
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,975
of every punk
that you sold

311
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,352
a 9 mil semi-automatic
pistol to in the last
few months.

312
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,525
(Nash)
He's got his back
turned every time.

313
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,978
He knows where
the cameras are.

314
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,188
(Brant)
Don't make me
come back

315
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,692
and give me
the same

316
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,323
fucking silly
answers, all right?

317
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,618
I'll ring
you when I've
got something.

318
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,912
(Brant)
I want the name, address
and fucking postal code.

319
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,489
(officer)
Sarge, come have
a look at this?

320
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,793
We've got no
footage of the killing
of the second officer.

321
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,745
(Nash)
There must be more.
Keep looking.

322
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,047
(man)
Sir.

323
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,850
You know what I want...

324
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,929
so spill.

325
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,849
Well, I need paying first.

326
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,446
What do you have in mind?

327
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,531
Serious.

328
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,654
Serious money.

329
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,077
Serious money?

330
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,654
Mmm-hmm.

331
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,331
What, like the time
of benefit?

332
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,203
Yeah.

333
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,537
[patting]
Bony fucker, aren't ya?

334
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,841
You don't have the brains
of a chicken, do you?

335
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,715
[groaning]

336
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,549
I doubt you have any real
Irish blood in you, Radnor.

337
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,932
Me, I'm a wild streak
and a Celt.
Makes me unpredictable.

338
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,893
Them Irish. Did you know
they invented kneecap?

339
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,316
It's a nasty business.

340
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,769
They fix you up
as best they can...

341
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,607
but you'll
always have a limp.
How does that sound?

342
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:30,320
Radnor the gimp.
How does that go down
in your retirement package?

343
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,824
[groaning]

344
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,498
[panting]

345
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,827
A brandy here, Paul.
And a large scotch.

346
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,004
[panting]

347
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,753
Here's what we'll do.

348
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:49,589
We'll have a nice stiff drink.
Ought to fire us off.

349
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,595
[crunching]

350
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,928
Well, go on, Rad.
Pay the man.

351
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,723
Well, l-- I don't
drink brandy.

352
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,439
Yeah, keep
the change.

353
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,989
Okay, tell me.

354
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,408
There's this bloke
at the Peacock Gym.

355
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,119
He set fire
to a police dog.

356
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,377
YouTubed it.
Somebody asked him
why he did it. He said...

357
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,343
"Practice."

358
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,919
Well, that's it?

359
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,925
Seriously, he's a nutter.

360
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,927
Fuck, if we pulled in
every wanker who said that...

361
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,599
we'd be up to our
arse in suspects.

362
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,143
What's his name?

363
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,095
Well, I don't--
I don't-- I don't know.

364
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,852
But I'm meeting a guy
later who's gonna
get it for me.

365
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,231
Don't bother.
I'll go to the gym.
Ask the manager.

366
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,439
But you see, l--
Don't I get something?

367
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,535
I left you the rest of my
crisps, you greedy bugger.

368
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,992
What more do you want?

369
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,198
For fuck's sake.

370
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,500
Are you fucking me?

371
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:03,250
Can I have
my change back, please?

372
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,252
Fuck, I can't walk.

[incidental music]

374
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,852

Are you as black
as you're painted?

375
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,571
[doorbell ringing]

376
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,660
[indistinct]

377
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,167
Disturbing you,
am l?

378
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,873
No, I was just
in the middle
of eating.

379
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,632
Go ahead.
That's your Tex Mex, isn't it?

380
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,050
Christ, what is that?

381
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,057
Hare Krishna food?
[burns out cigarette]

382
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,854
Better put some
meat in you, boy.

383
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,063
A big juicy steak.
Get the blood flowing.

384
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,065
[scoffs]
You know,
the chaps had a word...

385
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,114
for this type of
bare look, didn't they?

386
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,567
Minimalist.

387
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,612
Shy is the word
I had in mind.

388
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,618
Can I get a drink, then?

389
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,826
Over there.
Help yourself.

390
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,214
Jesus, no wonder you
stay at home.

391
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,541
[pouring]
So what are you having?

392
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,719
(Nash)
I've got some
water, thanks.

393
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:20,391
Can I ask you
why you're here?

394
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,011
I need your advice.

395
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:28,566
Look, I don't give
a fuck about you
being a pillow biter.

396
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,813
I don't give a fuck
what people do...

397
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,737
as long as they
keep it to themselves.

398
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,613
[sighs]

399
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,535
I respect you
and there's not many I do.

400
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,322
What's the problem?

401
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,376
I'm losing it.

402
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,587
In what way?

403
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,792
[sighs]

404
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,344
I'm blacking out.

405
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:02,050
Not often, but enough
to be worried.

406
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:07,142
Don't wanna talk, eat.

407
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,941
It's actually a huge effort
to drag myself outta bed.

408
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,986
[sighs]

409
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,611
I just stare at the wall.

410
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,901
Just do nothing, you know?

411
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,078
Absolutely nothing.

412
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,030
It's burnout.

413
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,331
What?

414
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,534
Your brain's on meltdown.

415
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,210
A couple of days
doing nothing...

416
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,878
and you’ll
start to come back.

417
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,956
You sound pretty sure.

418
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,212
Yeah, I am sure.
I've been there myself.

419
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,377
You?

420
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,880
Yeah. I could barely
work the microwave.

421
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,056
I was fucked.

422
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,226
We got this pedophile
on the loose in Holland Park.

423
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,055
He was luring
children into his car.

424
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,391
We knew who he was
but we just couldn't
catch him in the act.

425
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:56,521
These kids were too
traumatized to identify him.

426
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,776
He was this big
showbiz agent, you know.

427
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,279
Major connections.

428
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,076
The guys back
at the nick...

429
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,949
they just about put me
on a par with him...

430
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,905
because I was
a queer, yeah?

431
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,332
Wanked off into condoms
and leave them
in my locker...

432
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,661
scratched the car,
sugar in the petrol tank.

433
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,371
All the usual shit.

434
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,591
It put me
under tremendous pressure.

435
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,545
I was knocking back
Valium, shots at breakfast...

436
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,220
two packs a day.

437
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,889
So I thought, fuck it.

438
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,094
I thought I'd take matters
into my own hands.

439
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,892
And I broke
into the pedophile's
house at 4:00 in the morning...

440
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,725
and I smashed his bollocks
in with a baseball bat...

441
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,811
until they fucking popped.

442
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,770
I took a leave
of absence after that.

443
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,572
I was burnt out.

444
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,025
Came back here,
I shut the curtains.

445
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,205
Pulled the phone out.
Just hid away.

446
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,876
I went back to work
expecting the axe...

447
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,580
but they ended up
transferring me.

448
00:27:55,674 --> 00:28:02,421
[snoring]

449
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,968
Wanker.

[classical music]

451
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,868
Morning.
Want some breakfast?

452
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,992
A coffee,
two sugars.

453
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,838
You had an affair
with me?

454
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,087
I held back.

455
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,215
So any idea who
we're looking for?

456
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:48,094
A psycho.
Whistles while he works.

457
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,016
Showed up
at Peacock Gym yesterday.

458
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,599
I got the name
of a bloke in Nunhead.

459
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,929
Worth a visit?

460
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,643
You want me along?

461
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,770
Sure. See you there
in half an hour.

00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:07,826
Oh, yeah. The other thing,
about you being a good cop.
I meant that.

464
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,074
Thank you.

465
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,498

You're on compassionate leave.

is not easy.

Well, no--

473
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,007
How would you feel
about early retirement?

474
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,756
We'd miss you, sir.

475
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,803
You know who
else would miss you?

476
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,930
Olga, the 250-pound
call girl you see
every Wednesday.

Your wife thinks
you're playing squash.

Well, you are, in a way.

479
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,152
I don't need a fanfare.
I don't need an office.

you waiting for?

00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,240

How about a cuppa, coppers?

I know you.

502
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,993
If we'd met,
I'm sure I'd remember.

503

You know what that is?

were looking for?
Maybe I could help you.

took it down.

I posted it, yeah,
but I wasn't involved.

00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,048
I had a run in with
him about a year ago.

526
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,049
I might have put
him in the hospital.

527
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,256
Welcome to the liberal
Southeast.

528
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,558
It gets results.

529
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,852
Let's just keep
an eye on him.

530
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,555
You just wait and see.

531
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,766
Yeah?

532
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,318
[suspenseful music]

533
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,441
You wait and see.

534
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:00,528
What are you
fucking looking at,
you fucking perv?

535
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:07,139
[humming]

536
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,893
[bottles rolling]
Fuck. Ow!

537
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,279
Weiss. Nice.

538

[humming]

539
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,369
B. Weiss, P-23...

540
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,874
Weymouth Parking.
You little bastard.

541
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,831

[soft knock]

547
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,185
(Roberts)
Who is it?

548
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,888
(Weiss)
Satellite TV.

549
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,144
I've come for your box.

550
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,615
What's the problem?
I just paid the bill.

551
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,823
[chuckles}
That's funny...

552
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,574
because you
are the bill.

553
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,280
You're not
the usual bloke--

554
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,662
Ugh.

555
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,133
[crash]

556
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,026
Ah!

557
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,323
[thump and sound
of wet meat]

558
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,741
Ah!

[retches]

562
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,731
Question two. Which Scottish
music hall comedian--

563
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,354
B! B! B.

564
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,150
A. Jack Milroy

565
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,150
B. Andy Stewart
or C. Sir Harry Lauder?

566
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,074
B.

567
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,574
Come on, you fucking idiot, B.
[chuckles}

568
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,721
Yes.

569
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,182
Sweet.

570
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,867

[sirens continue to wail]

576
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,843
[Weiss over phone]
There 's a fire
at Cerinem Point.

577
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,048
In a flat on the 1 6th
floor, you'll find
cop number three.

578
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,680
Oh, I used a new system.

579
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,135
A new system?

580
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,596
Can you be
a bit clearer?

581
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,682
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

582
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,064
Is that clear
enough for you?
[hangs up]

583
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,396
[turns device on]

584
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,864
(Weiss)
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

585
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,236
[whispering]
Oh, yeah.

586
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,694
[phone ringing]
Oh, shit.

587
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,528
Yeah, I forgot.
I got a name.

588
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,740
A name?

589
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,950
Is there an echo?
Stop repeating
everything I say.

590
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,285
It's getting
on my fucking tits.

591
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,744
I'm sorry.

592
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,673
It's "Blitz"
as in "Blitzkrieg."

593
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,341
You got that?

594
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,295
Yeah. That's good. Yeah.
[phone ringing]

595
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,175
[phone ringing]

596
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,927
[whispering]
Oh, fuck.

597
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,346
Sarge, you need
to see this.

598
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,803
It's the evening edition.

599
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,309
Bastards!

600
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,316
[walla]

601
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:35,940
(Nash)
Where the hell
have you been?

602
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,400
Can't say.

603
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,619
What do you mean
you can't say?

604
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,412
Can't account
for my movements?

605
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,122
Is that
the correct lingo?

606
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,575
You do know another
policeman’s been killed?

607
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,080
Chief Inspector Roberts.

608
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,207
What?

609
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,835
(Nash)
The killer's targets
are in this station.

610
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,713
He used a hammer
to kill Roberts
and he torched his flat.

611
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,920
He contacted some hack
journalist at The Post...

612
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,973
called Dunlop.
Gave him all
the details.

613
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,924
Dunlop you say?

614
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,056
Yeah. Harold Dunlop.
I sent a team over there...

615
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,354
to tap his phone and make
sure his calls are traced.

616
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,601
Do you know him?

617
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,273
I do.

618
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,193
[incidental music]

619
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,895
I'm Harold Dunlop
from The Post.

620
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,855
[shouting]
Hey! Get off!

621
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,113
[Dunlop, shouting]
All right! All right!
Bloody hell!

622
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,409
What was
all that about?

623
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,403
I told you,
I know him.

624
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,077
(Brant)
Bastard put my
picture in the paper.

625
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:29,753

00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,328
Click.

630
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,635
Hello. Hello. Hello.

631
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,135
Bang. Bang.

632
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,692
Yippity-doo-dah-day.

633
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,111
[phone ringing]

634
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,072
Hello? Dunlop.

635
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,870
(man)
Is this Harold Dunlop?

636
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,619
Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,665
The Harold Dunlop?
The crime reporter?

638
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,742
Can you get me a latt?

639
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,749
Yeah. Who's this?

640
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,424
Mr. Dunlop, how would
you like to nail The Blitz?

641
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,793
Yeah, I 'd like
that very much.

642
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:04,548
(man)
Oh-ho! Is that it?
Perhaps I didn't make
myself clear, Mr. Dunlop.

643
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,758
I know the name
of the cop killer.

644
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:10,345
I think you're gonna
have to work a little bit
harder than that.

645
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,805
It'll be an honor to bring
that maniac to justice.

646
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,265
Yeah. Yeah.

647
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,271
Well, you'll have
a little think...

648
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,694
about how much
you'd be willing to pay.

649
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,025
Come now, Mr. Dunlop.

650
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,655
You didn't think this was
a citizen doing his bit
now, did you?

651
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,905
How much do you want?

652
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,033
50k. In cash.

653
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,241
For that, you get
the name of The Blitz...

654
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,166
plus extras.

655
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,040
Extras?
What do you mean extras?

656
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,588
Various assorted
items, Mr. Dunlop.

657
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,088
You'll find out
when I get my 50k.

658
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,967
I'm the master
of the fucking universe.

659
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,931
[humming]

660
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,978
Hello.

661
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,355
Hey.

662
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:04,737
The fire pretty much
destroyed anything
around the body.

663
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,361
(woman)
We found that in the bathroom.
The fire wasn't
so bad in there.

664
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,702
(Nash)
But did the heat or water
damage any DNA
or fingerprints?

665
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,578
I'm afraid so.

666
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,297
Peacock Gym.

667
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,091
(Nash)
Yeah, looks like it.
[dialing]

668
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:27,555
It's B rant.
Check if DI Roberts
was ever a member
of the Peacock Gym.

669
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,021
What are you doing?

670
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,144
I told you to wait
until you heard
from me.

671
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,022
Yeah, well,
I didn't hear from you.

672
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,773
Yeah.
Well, I'm sorting it.

673
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,404
Yeah? I'm trying to.

674
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,740
Look, just go home.

675
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,285
[incidental music]

676
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,839
DI Stokes?

677
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,344
You must be Falls.

678
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,800
Yeah. Yeah.

679
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,305
What'll you have?

680
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,605
Tea, please, sir.
Just tea.

681
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,399
Forget the "sir" stuff.
Craig'll do.

682
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,859
Tea and toast
for two!

683
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,732
(woman)
Coming up, love!

684
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,360
(Stokes)
Okay. Well, we've got
two of the kids...

685
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,361
involved in the assault
of Mr. Azziz.

686
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,612
I thought-- He's not--?

687
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,537
Dead? Incredibly, no.

688
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,205
Let me see.

689
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,160
John Wells,
known as Metal.

690
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,586
This the one
you wanted to discuss?

691
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:41,753
Yes.

692
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,923
What is he? A snitch?

693
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,966
Yeah, well, you know...

694
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,637
and I try to look out
for him.

695
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,807
Thank you.

696
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,760
He's a piece of shit.

697
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:56,844
A thug.

698
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,679
Oh, he's a boy.

699
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,642
Underneath all that,
he's just a scared boy.

700
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,651
So is there
anything you can do?

701
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,234
Anything can be buried.

702
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,321
Will you?

703
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,327
Meet me for a drink tonight.

704
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,749
[incidental music]

705
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,542
That's all?

706
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,760
Hey, Roberts and
the Peacock Gym.
Never a member.

707
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,058
No, of course not.

708
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,760
Have you got a minute?

709
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,061
Yeah.

710
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,059
Can you work that thing?

711
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,186
Brant, you're
such a dinosaur.

712
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,986
I'm surprised you can even
work your own microwave.

713
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:49,985
This is
women's work.
Just like typing.

714
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,816
Right.

715
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,572
So what are
you looking for?

716
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,579
Barry Weiss.
It's the Belfront Towers.

717
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:02,126
(Brant)
Kicked out of Peacock Gym.

718
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,876
(woman)
Oh, wow. This guy's
always in trouble.

719
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:10,630
He's been arrested more times
than you've had WPC's.

720
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,177
You know I'm
not like that.

721
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,095
Right.

722
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:17,926
(woman)
It's petty stuff, though.
What do you think?

723
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,557
No, nothing major.

724
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,888
None of that yet.

725
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,019
Have you got my money?

726
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,356
Yeah. I just had to
pull a few strings.

727
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:35,447
(man)
Pick me up outside
Weymouth Street car park.

728
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,541
Stand there.

729
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,716
All right.

730
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,261
There. Steady. There.

731
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,714
Oh, Jesus.

732
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,649
[click]

733
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,694
Click.

734
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,320
[suspenseful music]

735
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,157
(Radnor)
These are the extras
I was talking about.

736
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,414
Trophies, I believe
is the correct term.

737
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,745
And you know
who these belong to, eh?

738
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,297
Correct.

739
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,923
[shuts trunk]

740
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,967
[suspenseful
music intensifies]

741
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,885
Right, I showed
you mine.

742
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,760
Perhaps we could
have a little look
at yours now.

743
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,593
[humming]

744
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:47,314
[indistinct]

745
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,744
All right.

746
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,624
Aw.

747
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,921
What?

748
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,248
That's not
fifty grand.

749
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,791
Of course
it's fifty grand.

750
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,251
There's no way
that's fifty grand.

751
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,836
When did you
last see fifty grand?

752
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,592
Don't you trust me?
Go and count it.

753
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,762
It's about
500 quid.

754
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,181
Oh. Go on, then.

755
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,930
I'm gonna count
every bit of it.

756
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,516
Good. Buy yourself
a new suit.

757
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:31,852
[suspenseful music]

758
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,688
Fifty, fifty,
fifty, fifty, fifty.

759
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,734
You are a fucking genius.

760
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,568
[door closes]

761
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:45,031
[suspenseful music]

762
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,292
I haven't told him
your name yet.

763
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,378
(Weiss)
Relax. I'm not
gonna hurt you.

764
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:59,925
I only do police. Remember?

765
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,131
How'd you get on to me?

766
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:07,516
I got your address
from the Peacock Gym...

767
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:11,645
and I went
through your rubbish.

768
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,977
I found the receipt
for the parking garage.

769
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,858
That's very impressive.

770
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,066
[whispering]
I haven't told him
your name yet.

771
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,283
I haven't
told him your name.

772
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,990
But you're gonna
have to help me
out, see?

773
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,621
Ah.

774
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,624
I haven't told him
your name yet.

775
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,922
This is a bit
of a tight squeeze.

776
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,091
[groaning]

777
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,214
I haven't told him
your name yet.

778
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:41,796
No, no, no.

779
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,347
[man crying]

780
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:48,394
[drowning
and screaming]

781
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,979
[toilet flushing]

782
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,423
A double Irish.

783
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,221
Can't do, buddy.
I'm closed.

784
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,767
Listen up. I'm only
gonna say this once.
I ain't your 'buddy.'

785
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,027
When I ask
for a drink, you say,
"Ice with that, sir?"

786
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,651
Now let's begin again.
A double Irish.

787
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,069
[background police radio]

788
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,324
You want ice
with that, sir?

789
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,498
Don't be ridiculous.
Who needs ice?

790
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,543
[pouring]

791
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,838
That’ll be five quid, sir.

792
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,790
Like you said...

793
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,501
you're closed.

794
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:06,096
(Dunlop)
He went to the toilet.
When he hadn't come back...

795
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,096
I got concerned.
I thought he fell in.

796
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,382
He did.

797
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,134
(Nash)
Then what happened?

798
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,720
Well, I went in there,
didn't l? I found him.

799
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,098
(Brant)
Well, you didn't
exactly come rushing out
though, did you, Mr. Dunlop?

800
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,809
The man at the bar says
you was with him
for ten minutes.

801
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,611
Had you down as a couple
of George Michael fans.

802
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,564
Hey, I was looking
for the money.

803
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,069
Money?

804
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,696
(Dunlop)
The paper's money.

805
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,993
We were paying him
for an exclusive.

806
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,116
Oh, for fuck's sake.

807
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,617
Can I remind you
that people...

808
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:32,573
are being killed
here, Mr. Dunlop?

809
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,499
Ah, yeah?

810
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,043
Yeah. Human beings,
with families and children.

811
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,838
There's a car. Yeah.
Oh, God, I forgot.

812
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,133
Yeah. A car.
You're not gonna
believe what's inside.

813
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,085
Where is this car?

814
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,592
Weymouth Street car park.
It's a black Jaguar.

815
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,843
Bay 23!

816
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,020
Oy! Am I gonna get
police protection?

817
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,643
Oh, yeah.

818
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,726
We'll be all over you.

819
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,357
Should've been
the other guy
had him killed.

820
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:05,565
[incidental music]

821
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,580
What now?

822
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,049
Murder inquiry.
I want the disc
for the last month.

823
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,421
(man)
Discs are full.

824
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,294
What do you mean
they’re full?

825
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,926
(man)
They haven't recorded
anything for six weeks.

826
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,133
It ran out of memory.
They'll fix it Monday.

827
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,309
I don't believe this.

828
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,763
The cameras are
really turned on.
It's psychological.

829
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,019
(Nash)
You don't give
a shit, do ya?

830
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,602
It's disgraceful.

831
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:48,532
So is you eating it.

832
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,328
[pop music]

833
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,101
[suspenseful music]

834
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,724
(Stokes)
Hey.

835
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,897
You look nice.

836
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,143
(Falls)
Thanks.

837
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,395
Can I take
your coat?

838
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,143
Yeah.

839
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,365
Thank you.

840
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,158
Have a seat.

841
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,953
[suspenseful
music intensifies]

842
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,753
[mouthing silently]

843
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,058
You've gone quiet.

844
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,015
I like
listening to you.

845
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,590
Everything all right?

846
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,542
There's got to be
an easier way to do this.

847
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,343
Fuck, Brant.

848
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,547
So how does it feel
to actually need
us girls...

849
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:39,017
for more
than just cooking
and cleaning and shagging?

850
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:43,814
I was sorting a way
of listing all Weiss'
arresting officers.

851
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,109
I've seemed to pull up
the first one. It's
WPC Sandra Bates.

852
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,436
[incidental music]

853
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,779
You're kidding.

854
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,823
I've had
a really nice time.

855
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,246
Yeah.

856
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,790
[engine continues]

857
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,328
I'll call you.

858
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,051
[clears throat]
When?

859
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,630
When are you
gonna call me?

860
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,511
Tomorrow.

861
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,433
I'll tell you what.
How about this summer...

862
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,224
we'll do a picnic?

863
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:27,354
Don't you think
I know how this goes?

864
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,435
Man says,
"I'll call you"...

865
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,732
and a woman's waiting
and hoping.

866
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,905
She's a slave
to her mobile...

867
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,654
while he's thinking,
"Well, I'll call her...

868
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:41,660
tomorrow, some day,
Monday. Doesn't matter.
Well, here's a hint, yeah?

869
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,708
It matters.
It matters a lot.

870
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,831
Tomorrow. I'll
call you tomorrow.

871
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,378
No, fuck off.

872
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,371
Hey!

873
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:50,623
[shuts door]

Jesus. Look who else.

Fuck. That's Roberts.

880
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,904
(Brant)
And Falls.

881
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,736
[suspenseful music]

882
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,493
Shit. How could l
be that stupid?

883
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,667
Send an armed response
unit round to her flat
straight away.

884
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,119
It's a 1 9.

885
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,580
Come on, Falls.
We're coming.

886
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:34,132
[phone ringing]
Oh.

887
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,925
Oh, shit.

888
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:40,222
[phone ringing]
I'm stupid.
I'm stupid.

889
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,173
[screaming and thump]

890
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,059
[Weiss shouting]
What the fuck?

891
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,234
What the fuck?

892
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,690
Ugh!

893
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,899
[groans]

894
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,154
[screaming]

895
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,360
[loud crack]

896
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,446
[sirens wailing]

897
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,825
Not--

898
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,754
[sirens wailing louder]

899
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,805
[screaming]

900
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,515
[background police radio
and incidental music]

901
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,906
[camera shutter clicks]

902
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,662
Doctors have given her
a sedative. She should
be out for a while.

903
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,584
Did she get a look
at the attacker?

904
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,208
All she could say for sure
is that he's big and white.

905
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,130
Big and white.

906
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:59,335
So it's not
the black kid
from Different Strokes.

907
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,592
It's Barry Weiss.
I know him.

908
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,139
Should you be
taking her booze?

909
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,309
[pouring]
Well, she
won't notice.

910
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,635
Want one?

911
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,595
Yeah.

912
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,851
[sighs]

913
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,859
[panting]
Is she all right?

914
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,902
(Nash)
Who are you?

915
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,650
DI Craig Stokes.

916
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,280
I heard someone
got killed.

917
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,904
It's not Falls.

918
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,575
Cop killer
took a run at her.

919
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,324
Some kid jumped in,
a hoodie.

920
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:29,247
He got his ticket punched.

921
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,541
(Nash)
Were you
with Falls this evening?

922
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,371
Yes. We went
for a drink and
I dropped her off.

923
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,293
You dropped her
in it, you mean.

924
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:41,676
Did it not occur
to you to walk her
to the door?

925
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,596
What agent.

926
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,548
[incidental music]

927
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,936
Taxi!

928
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:56,562
(Weiss)
Can you take me
to Bayswater?

929
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,859
[shuts door]

930
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,356
It's gonna
cost you, mate.

931
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,903
Hey, Bronski Beat.

932
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,731
Do I look like
the kind of cunt...

933
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,317
who thinks
Bayswater is just
around the corner?

934
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:08,028
[suspenseful music]

935
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,790
Hey, stop here.
Stop here, mate.

936
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,588
There. Dean Court.

937
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,718
[Weiss, chuckles]
All right.

938
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:24,965
Yeah, all right.

939
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,546
There you go.
Keep it.

940
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,393
[woman over TV]
1,000 pounds.

941
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:40,607
And question two.
We wanted to know the
post code for BIair Castle.

942
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,154
Don't know how many
of you ever visited
Blair Castle.

943
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,330
Is he dead?

944
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,791
What, the little skinhead?

945
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:06,299
It was a doornail.

946
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,150
What's the story
with you and him?

947
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:25,356
Him risking
his life for ya.

948
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,284
Oh, I've known him
since he was twelve.

949
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:33,865
He used to live
next door.

950
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,585
When I came out of rehab,
he was the only one around
here I wanted to know.

951
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:43,086
He made me tea.

952
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,337
I don't know.
I thought...

953
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,669
I could help him.

954
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:52,224
Oh, my God.

955
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,892
[sobbing]

956
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,767

[blast]

960
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,763
He definitely
did a bunk.

961
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,386
Find anything?

962
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,225
Nothing incriminating, no.

963
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:40,347
(Nash)
Used to be
a good looking boy.
He let himself go a bit.

964
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,434
Let's go public
with Weiss.

965
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,061
Your call.

966
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,863
At least we'll flush
the fucker out.

967
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,744
[man over TV}
Police today released
a picture of the suspect...

968
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,368
they would like to question
regarding The Blitz.

969
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,916
Yeah! I know him!

970
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,336
I dropped the guy off.
He was fucking psycho.

Long time, no see.

(Nash)
Hey.

975
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,145
Jack, this is
Detective Brant.

976
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,346
Hello, mate.

977
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,601
Where's our boy?

978
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,273

He's on the move.

We have him on the Great
Western Road.

01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,511

Head down to Harrow Road.
We 'Il put him off
at the underpass.

What the fuck--
[thump}

1006
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,391
(Nash)
Leave it, Brant.

1007

Get this piece
of shit out of here.

1011

Just calm down.
Calm down.

1012
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,899
Move! Now!

1013
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,575
We've got him.

1014
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,077

him, okay?
We've got him.

1017
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,379
[female on TV]
The Metropolitan Police
have just confirmed...

1018
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,594
the arrest of Barry
Weiss, the prime suspect
in The Blitz killings...

1019
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:25,136
in which three London Police
officers were murdered
in cold blood...

1020
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:28,093
after a dramatic chase
through West London--

1021
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,723
[scream and crack]

1022
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,100

train depot.

1023
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:35,058

to comment any further--

(Falls)
Just selling
records, yeah?

1025
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,573
(Nash)
We're going
to record this.
Okay, Barry?

1026
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:43,301
I want a lawyer
and a sandwich.

1027
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:47,848
Oh, and I want to update
my Facebook status.

1028
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,890
(lawyer)
You have exactly
forty-eight hours.

1029
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,845
In that time,
you either charge
my client or release him.

1030
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:06,317
And he'd like
a different sandwich.
He says the bread is stale.

1031
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,244
(Nash)
Weiss might be crazy
but he's not stupid.

1032
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,366
He's covered
his tracks.

1033
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,415
The fire at Roberts'
flat destroyed any
forensic evidence...

1034
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:17,369
we might have had.
Even the Peacock
Gym link is tenuous.

1035
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,959
(Nash)
Well, he's admitted
the Jag belongs to him.

1036
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,290
It's been
sitting in a car park
for at least six months.

1037
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,172
Anyone could've
had access to it.
There's no CCTT.

1038
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:29,882
(Brant)
I got ahold of the guy
with the dogs, the one that
saw the first murder.

1039
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,888
Now he's saying he can't
make a positive I D.

1040
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,387
All right, de 's too scared.
Same goes for the barman
at the Wellesley.

1041
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,185
(Superintendent)
You didn't find
anything at the hotel?

1042
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,356
Nothing.

1043
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:40,809
What about Forensics?

1044
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,228
Team stripped
it down, but no.

1045
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,779
With what we've got,
he'll be out tomorrow
laughing his head off.

1046
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,403
We need something solid.

1047
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,617
We'd better come up
with something quick.

1048
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,950
Otherwise, the killer
is gonna hop, skip
and jump out of here.

1049
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,747
The only thing he's getting
so far is a caution.

01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,897
All right, Babe?

1053
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:25,354
Yeah. Yeah, no. I've been
away, but...

1054
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,734
I'm back now.

1055
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,316
Do you want to come
to my party?

1056
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:34,700
[exhaling]
Yeah, like old times.

1057
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,749
Can you take care
of me?

1058
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,746
Sweet.

1059
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:44,046
[walla]

1060
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,418
What's this?

1061
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,258
Moonshine.
Irish moonshine.

1062
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,756
Isn't this
stuff illegal?

1063
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,054
I fucking hope so.

1064
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,590
You drink this poison
and then you wonder
why you get blackouts.

1065
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,347
I drink this poison
because I get blackouts.

1066
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,644
Sláinte.

1067
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,096
Cheers.

1068
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:09,447
Say we
can't prove anything.
Say Barry Weiss walks.

1069
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,531
Where are you
going with this?

1070
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,452
Well, you told
me once before
about some pedophile.

1071
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,698
You couldn't
get the bastard through
the regular channels, so...

1072
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,409
you took him out yourself.

1073
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,167
I thought you were asleep
when I told you that.

1074
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,250
I'm not gonna continue
this line of talk.

1075
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,009
I don't like
where it's going.

1076
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,396
Been a busy couple
of days for you, Barry.

1077
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:53,241
Took a ride in a police car.
Got your picture in the paper.

1078
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:57,115
Highlight of your career.

1079
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:00,869
You know, Barry,
if you were smart...

1080
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,542
which I know you're not...

1081
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,416
you'd admit to what you did...

1082
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:10,800
because I'm gonna tell
you now, you'll be a lot
safer in here than out there.

1083
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,549
Were they
friends of yours...

1084
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,381
those cops
that got killed?

1085
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:21,887
[suspenseful music]

1086
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,727
You see...

1087
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,151
I know what this
is about, Barry.

1088
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,322
(Brant)
What did those lads
ever do to you, Barry?

1089
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:41,326
Of course, you knew.
How did you react?

1090
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,908
Fuck you, pig.

1091
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:47,040
(Brant)
They call that
resisting arrest.

1092
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,998
I call it stupid.

1093
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:56,008
[incidental music]

1094
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,680
I know I embarrassed you.

1095
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,594
Since then you've stewed...

1096
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:07,398
and cooked
and simmered over it.

1097
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:10,017
[sighs]

1098
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:14,731
You should've just let it go.

1099
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,082
Personally...

1100
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:30,289
I didn't remember until
I saw you. Didn't give it
a second thought.

1101
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,422
It was so insignificant,
I forgot all about it.

1102
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:39,263
We sure all laughed when
I played the surveillance
tapes at the station.

1103
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:44,219
We all did.
But that stuff's silly.

1104
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,851
[men chuckling]

1105
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,061
Sergeant Brant
to you.

1106
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,393
[groaning]

1107
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,522
[men continue chuckling]

1108
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,107
The point is, Barry...

1109
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,944
you're nothing.

1110
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,373
No one cares.

1111
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,963
No one gives a fuck.

1112
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,883
[suspenseful music]

1113
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,552
Oh, and another thing.

1114
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:22,928
You, The Blitz.

1115
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,351
What the fuck is that?

1116
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:28,521
[scoffs]

1117
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:36,733
[incidental music]

1118
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,632
[door clanks shut
and locks]

1119
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:16,273
[pop music]

1120
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,529
Don't mean to bomb
you out, bro...

1121
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,118
but there's some major
shit going down.

1122
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:29,665
I'm listening.

1123
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,288
A cop's ripped off
a dealer.

1124
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,039
What?

1125
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,212
They're getting
into the products, man.

1126
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,255
This dealer is like
serious folks.

1127
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:41,677
You fuck with him
and he gets difficult,
even with a woman.

1128
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:44,972
Whoa. Whoa.
Back up a second.

1129
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:47,550
A female cop
is ripping off
drug dealers?

1130
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:51,012
She a sister, too.

1131
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,768
This cop
have a name?

1132
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,769
Yeah. Falls.

1133
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,148
[dialing]

1134
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,697
Brant. It's Stokes.
Listen, I need your help.

1135
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,372
I think she's inside.

1136
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,377
[very loud music]

1137
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:18,664
You crashed
a party, man.

1138
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:22,047
"You crashed
a party?" You
fucking-- Get him out!

1139
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,594
Come here.

1140
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,091
[shouting]

1141
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:31,057
[mumbles unintelligibly]

1142
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,308
[loud music continues]

1143
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,981
Do you like me?
If you like me--

1144
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:40,277
[continues mumbling]

1145
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:41,900
Look at this shit.

1146
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:47,156
If you like me,
you can throw me a party.

1147
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,702
[indistinct]

1148
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,280
What are you doing?
I don't wanna go!

1149
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,037
[shouting]
Go back.
He's gonna kill me!

1150
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:57,370
He's gonna kill me!
No! He's gonna kill me!

1151
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,873
[shouting and crying]
No!

1152
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,879
He's gonna kill me!

1153
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,621
What are these?

1154
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,495
Thanks. They’ll
bring you down.

1155
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,749
The shower did that.

1156
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:42,002
Just take 'em, Falls.

1157
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,971
[incidental music]

1158
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,683
I'm messed up,
aren't l?

1159
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:02,310
Even when I was
working undercover...

1160
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,395
I was a cop
pretending to be a junkie.

1161
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:08,115
But really, I'm just a junkie
playing at being a cop.

1162
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,956
He's gonna get away
with it, isn't he?

1163
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,161
If we can't protect our own,
what good are we, Brant?

1164
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,962
What good are we?

1165
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,620
A lot
of press waiting?

1166
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:58,206
Yes, I'm afraid so.
There's quiet a crowd
gathered outside the front.

1167
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,377
But we can leave
through a different
exit, if you prefer.

1168
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,037
Fuck no!

1169
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,839
I hope it's all there.

1170
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,730
Is something
on your mind, Barry?

1171
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:26,060
Well, I guess I'll
see you another day.

1172
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,237
I can't wait.

1173
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:31,282
[crowd exclaiming]

1174
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,859
[curtain music]

1175
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:04,849
Don't worry. We're
having him tailed
around the clock.

1176
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,767
Keep him
out of trouble.

1177
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,740
[suspenseful music]

1178
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:22,200
[mumbling]

1179
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:31,083
(policeman)
We're in position now.
He's going into his flat.

1180
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,089
[knocking]

1181
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,598
[door opens]

1182
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,158
Is Brant still here?

1183
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:59,077
No. No, he left.

1184
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,246
It's Roberts' funeral
this afternoon.

1185
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,870
Every cop in the Southeast
is gonna be there.

1186
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,792
Except you.

1187
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,004
[suspenseful music]

1188
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,148
[rainfall]

1189
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,446
[sad music]

1190
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,817
(priest)
In company with Christ
who died and now lives...

1191
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,742
may the rejoicing
in Your Kingdom...

1192
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,572
where all our tears
are wiped away...

1193
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,158
unite us together again
in one family...

1194
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,790
to sing Your praise
forever and ever.

1195
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,917
Amen.

1196
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,841
Eternal rest grant
unto him, Oh, Lord...

1197
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:02,925
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

1198
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:06,512
[ominous music]

1199
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,644
(priest)
into Your hand,
Father of Mercy...

1200
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:13,728
we commend our brother
in sure and certain hope...

1201
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,317
that together, all who
have died in Christ...

1202
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:19,525
will live with Him one day.

1203
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:23,238
In nomine Patris,
Filii et Spiritu
Sancti. Amen.

1204
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:36,884
Beloved Bruce Roberts,
we give your body
to the earth.

1205
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,552
Earth Mother,
Root Mother...

1206
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,676
Father of soil.

1207
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:46,261
We give You this body
of our beloved Bruce Roberts.

1208
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,142
His eyes will never
greet us again.

1209
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,349
Return to earth.

1210
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,150
We will not kiss these lops.

1211
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,229
Return to earth.

1212
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:59,065
[thunder
and suspenseful music]

1213
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,621
What he has been is gone.

1214
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,418
What he is now
has passed the gate...

1215
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:16,081
leaving his body
to become soil.
[suspenseful music
intensifies]

1216
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,667
This flesh
to nurture flowers...

1217
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:22,675
these bones
to be roots of trees.

1218
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,837
[suspenseful music continues]

1219
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,233
Come on.

1220
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:48,674
[phone ringing]

1221
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:51,226
(Brant)
Yeah, what's the latest?

1222
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,725
(policeman)
Weiss hasn't left
his flat all day.

1223
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,849
[mumbles unintelligibly]

1224
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,320
Fuck.

1225
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:03,943
[suspenseful music continues]

1226
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,903
[clicks]

1227
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:48,984
[suspenseful music
intensifies]

1228
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,889
[sirens wailing
far away]

1229
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,406
[suspenseful music continues]

1230
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:08,196
Brant! Turn around,
you fucker!

1231
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,899
I wanna see your face
as your head explodes.

1232
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,659
Ugh. Agh.

1233
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,334
[groaning]

1234
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,633
[panting]
What? You think
you fooled me?

1235
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:33,384
No chance. I was
just playing along.

1236
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:34,677
Ugh!

1237
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,805
Ugh!
[groaning]

1238
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,273
[growling
and groaning]

1239
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,356
Come on, Barry.

1240
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,986
What are you
gonna do?

1241
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,617
Huh? Call
the cops?

1242
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,049
[spitting]

1243
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:14,004
You stupid fucking pig.

1244
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:17,762
Wait till the papers
get a load of this, hey.

1245
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,844
I'm gonna sue you.

1246
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,303
And you.

1247
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:24,890
And all of you
fucking pig cunts.

1248
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:28,352
I'm gonna make
fucking millions.

1249
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:31,028
[suspenseful music continues]

1250
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,856
You fucking--

1251
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,612
(Nash)
Brant?

1252
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:40,997
You fuck.

1253
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,416
You can't kill me.

1254
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,332
I'm The Blitz.

1255
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,043
Are you talking
about that cop killer?

1256
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:52,046
That can't be you, Barry.

1257
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,550
We tried to convict you
but you were innocent.

1258
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:59,846
The only thing we do know
is he was partial to
people in uniform...

1259
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,678
just like the one
you're wearing.

1260
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:06,640
And he used a weapon
just like this one.

1261
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:36,799
Fucking lucky
he didn't shoot
me in the head.

1262
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:54,317
Something tells me
this one's gonna
remain unsolved.

1263
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,820
You're not supposed
to smoke in here.

1264
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,031
What you gonna do?

1265
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,831
Shoot me?

1266
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:11,998
[Dunlop, chuckling]
I'm just leaving
the office now, darling.

1267
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,834
Yeah, I'll be back at 7:00.
I love you too, Amanda. Yeah.

1268
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:16,509
[dogs growling
and barking]

1269
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:19,212
There he is.
There's Brecky.

1270
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,342
Fuck.

1271
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,048
Bon appétit.

1272
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,850
[shouting and barking]

1273
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:26,849
(Dunlop)
Get out! Get away!

1274
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:30,228
[shouting and barking]
