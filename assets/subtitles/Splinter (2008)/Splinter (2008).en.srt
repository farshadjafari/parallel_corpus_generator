1
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,468
Go on. I ain't got nothin'. Psst!

2
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,431
Sweet Jesus!

3
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,433
Oh, God! No! No! No!

4
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,276
<i>Yeah,
this is definitely our campsite.</i>

5
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,358
- So...
- So we're here. Come on.

6
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,430
Can you help me with this?

7
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,197
Here. Over there, by the fire pit.

8
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,237
- Oh, here, here, here, here.
- Oh, yeah. You need that.

9
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,310
Need the hatchet.

10
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,910
- Thank you for doing this.
- I was made for camping.

11
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,956
- This is, like, my thing.
- Hm-hm.

12
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,634
- What? Oh, really?
- Hm-hm.

13
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,716
- You know what?
- What?

14
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,233
- I think I'm gonna like camping.
- Yeah?

15
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,310
- Hm-hm.
- I told you.

16
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,831
Ow! Wait a minute.

17
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,677
- Did you get the bug stuff?
- Come on. Let's get this tent up.

18
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,750
Come on.

19
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,867
Shit, shit, shit.

20
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,149
- The engine's fucking destroyed.
- This ain't how you talked it, D.

21
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,074
Mexico is just around the corner,
sweetheart. Come on.

22
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,831
It's not.

23
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,833
Well, this truck ain't getting us
any closer, alright? Let's go.

24
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,033
- Mine's in.
- It can't be. I... Hold on.

25
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,680
- Well, just hold that. Just trust me.
- OK.

26
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,478
- Hey, got it.
- OK, mine's in.

27
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,028
Ow! Well, now mine's not.

28
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,792
- Are you OK?
- This is...

29
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,269
- Are you sure you got the right hole?
- OK, is this the right pole?

30
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,069
- Look how short that pole is.
- Yeah, it's... Yeah.

31
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,754
I'm starting to think
we're not wilderness people.

32
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,276
Of course we are.
We can't let this tent beat us, OK?

33
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,908
You always say we have to be smarter
than what we're working against.

34
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,593
You know what I'm definitely
smarter than? A motel.

35
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,911
No. You can't see the stars
from a motel. And that wasn't the deal.

36
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,629
The deal was anniversary sex
under the stars.

37
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,199
OK, that part sounds kind of familiar.

38
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,590
Alright, hold your end.
I'll get this in.

39
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,271
- OK.
- You ready? You got it?

40
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,553
OK.

41
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,588
Oh!

42
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,711
Are you kidding me?

43
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,949
Tell me you remembered the spare tent.

44
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,954
<i>No.</i>

45
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,600
Come here. Come here.

46
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,911
Motel. Motel. Motel.

47
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,230
Come on. Come on!

48
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,036
OK.

49
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,473
What are you doing?

50
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,307
Hey, D. That's all our stuff.

51
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,711
We're getting all new stuff, baby.
All new stuff.

52
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,598
Hey, who's the cowgirl, huh?

53
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,148
I fucking hate it when you call me that.

54
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,156
Hey, there's my cowgirl. There she is.

55
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,639
Let's go.

56
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,838
Just gotta hang on a little while
longer. We're almost fucking there.

57
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,033
Who's my lady Lacey, huh?

58
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,557
There you are, baby. Just gotta hang on
a little while fucking longer, alright?

59
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,556
- Do you realise how old this forest is?
- No. Please tell me.

60
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,350
The whole area mostly sucks for logging,
so these trees are completely untouched.

61
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,828
Some of them are 400 years old,
maybe more.

62
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,150
- Really?
- They just grow older and older.

63
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,471
You know, if you spent half as much time
in nature as you do reading about it,

64
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,677
we'd be cuddling
under the stars tonight.

65
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,750
Cuddling.

66
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,630
Hey, come on.

67
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,350
Now we get to spend our anniversary
basking in the glow of free cable TV.

68
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,716
Next year we're camping.

69
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,312
- Alright.
- OK.

70
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,953
See that tree right there? That's a post
oak, a 300-year-old tree at least.

71
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,837
Baby, could we please
just have a moment of silence,

72
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,558
you know, to mourn the loss of our tent?

73
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,756
OK. Look at the positives here
for two seconds. Just go with me.

74
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,195
- OK.
- We get to stay at a ghetto-ass motel.

75
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,590
There's gonna be bugs everywhere.
The AC will probably be broken.

76
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,308
It's gonna be every bit as uncomfortable
as sleeping in the wilderness.

77
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,870
- So why are you complaining?
- Will there be holes in the sheets?

78
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,519
We won't stop
until we find a place that does.

79
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,229
- Or I'll poke holes in them myself.
- I love you.

80
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,350
Oh! Look at that tree. That's gotta be
at least 400 years old, right?

81
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,953
- Look how big that one is.
- That's an old tree.

82
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,158
I'd say closer to 100 or 200.
See it has stumps halfway up?

83
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,312
You're gonna laugh at me?
You're gonna laugh at me when I'm...

84
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,471
I think you're cute.
It's adorable when you talk about trees.

85
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,153
I'm not gonna talk about 'em any more.

86
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,313
<i>What the?</i>

87
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,948
Did you?

88
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,831
- What's she doing out here by herself?
- She looks... not right.

89
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,154
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- Hm.

90
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,515
- She's coming up here.
- I don't know. I think it's weird.

91
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,794
<i>- It's OK. Go.
- Maybe he's with her.</i>

92
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,518
- No, thank you.
- I don't know.

93
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,750
- Oh, my God, Seth.
- Are you fucking deaf?

94
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,437
- Whoa, whoa!
- Out of the fucking car now. Out.

95
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,875
- Baby, no!
- We're good, baby. We're good.

96
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,951
<i>Turn it off. Get out of the car.</i>

97
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,918
Nice and easy, alright?
Get out of the car.

98
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,913
- Just... Just...
- Get out of the fucking car now!

99
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,955
- Oh, God!
- OK, OK.

100
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,917
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, yeah.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,433
Clear the back seat.
Make room for two more.

102
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,273
No, D, you can't change the plan.
You said no hostages.

103
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,113
I know what I said, baby.
I know what I said. Listen to me.

104
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,634
Plat's 40 miles up the road.

105
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,029
The bank's closed. It don't open
till 8am. Listen to me. Trust me.

106
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,111
We're gonna do this right.
Come here. Come here.

107
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,397
Listen to me. You gotta trust me, OK?
You trust me? You trust me?

108
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,947
OK, give me a kiss.

109
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,991
OK, go get in the front seat.
Let's go, kid.

110
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,110
That's twice.

111
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,191
OK.

112
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,033
- Up.
- Oh, God. God.

113
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,553
- You, around the front. Drive.
- I can drive.

114
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,870
- I wasn't talking to you. Drive.
- What? I can't...

115
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,918
- Drive the fucking car!
- I can't drive stick, OK?

116
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,869
Fuck! Get in the fucking car.

117
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,157
Hands on the wheel,
off the fucking locks.

118
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,958
You, in back, over here.
Lacey's up front.

119
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,394
Go on. Step in there, Lacey.

120
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,072
Get in the fucking car.

121
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,720
Everybody nice and fucking comfy now?

122
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,754
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah. I'm cold.

123
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,673
OK, OK. Just relax, just relax.
Let's go.

124
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,238
- OK, OK.
- What's the problem? Yeah? OK?

125
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,311
OK. Uh-uh.

126
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,870
Wallets and cellphone, give 'em up.

127
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,038
- Same page, friend?
- Seth, just give him the damn thing.

128
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,713
Yeah, just give it to me, Seth.

129
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,957
Jesus. Five bucks?
Don't anybody carry cash any more?

130
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,995
Here, baby. Take that. See if you can
find anything for you in there.

131
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,437
Seth Turner. Polly Watt.

132
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,751
Same address, different names.
Hm. Not married?

133
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,437
- Living together in sin?
- Come on, Dennis.

134
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,715
That ain't your business, now.

135
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,149
Student ID. A little old, ain't you?

136
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,389
- It's a PhD.
- Oh.

137
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,153
- You a doctor?
- Not yet, no.

138
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,437
- But you can do script, huh?
- What?

139
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,116
- Can you write prescriptions?
- No. No, it's a biology PhD.

140
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,998
- Lacey.
- OK. Then you ain't a fucking doctor.

141
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,432
Great.

142
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,077
Not yet.

143
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,389
Where are we going?

144
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,076
Just drive till I say different.
This is a dictatorship from here on out.

145
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,469
If you wanna make life easy,
don't talk no more.

146
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,519
<i>Shit, what was that?</i>

147
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,192
- We hit something.
- What?

148
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,668
Ginger. Ginger.

149
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,638
- Ginger? Ginger's dead, baby.
- We've got a flat tyre.

150
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,190
- What the fuck are you trying to do?
- Relax, Lacey. It's gonna be fine.

151
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,750
- Get the spare. You.
- Er...

152
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,434
- Get the spare!
- I'll get it. It's not his car.

153
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,273
It's not my car.

154
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,911
You know, you suffer from
a severe case of CDS. Can't do shit.

155
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,312
You think Ginger's OK?
She's just a puppy. Huh?

156
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,230
Hurry up.

157
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,033
Here. Hey, if he moves, shoot him.

158
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,399
Hey, let's go.

159
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,990
OK.

160
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,270
Go.

161
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,028
Ginger.

162
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,951
Ginger.

163
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,998
OK. It's OK.

164
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,832
Momma's here now.
It's gonna be OK, Ginger.

165
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,717
OK. You... You gotta help her.

166
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,119
- Please.
- You...

167
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,715
- Come on, Biology. Ginger needs you.
- OK. I'm...

168
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,677
I'm pretty sure it's dead.

169
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,517
Here, make this quick. Fit this tyre.

170
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,030
Grab that.

171
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,354
Ah! Damn.

172
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,151
What the?

173
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,635
You're gonna help her.

174
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,711
- Come on.
- OK. OK.

175
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,273
OK.

176
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,868
It's OK. No, it's OK, lovely.
He's a doctor.

177
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,034
I don't care what Dennis says, OK, baby?

178
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,476
We're gonna take you home, OK?
We're gonna save you.

179
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,676
What is wrong with her?

180
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,834
- I don't know what...
- Hey, fix it.

181
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,671
Alright. Alright.

182
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,517
See these? I don't...

183
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,710
What is that?

184
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,198
Holy shit! Holy motherfucker!

185
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,310
- Seth!
- Get that thing on the ground. Lacey!

186
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,913
- Baby.
- What happened? You OK? Talk to me.

187
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,753
- Shut up!
- Talk to me. Talk to me, Lacey.

188
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,711
<i>- Lacey.
- Get in. Get in!</i>

189
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,268
- Did he mess with you?
- Get in! D, get in.

190
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,429
- Get in the car.
- Seth! Seth!

191
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,112
Ah, fuck!

192
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,228
- What happened?
- We gotta get out of here.

193
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,515
- Drive this fucking car!
- What happened?

194
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,715
- I'm not leaving him.
- Oh, fuck! Drive!

195
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,997
- I'm not leaving him.
- Fuck! Come on. Go!

196
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,196
Go, go. OK. Go, go! Drive!

197
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,509
Speed up.

198
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,557
I will blow a hole in you
big enough to watch TV through.

199
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,676
- Fucking stop!
- Tell me what's happened, Lace.

200
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,228
What happened back there, hm?

201
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,959
She tried to get me.

202
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,030
- Who?
- Ginger.

203
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,516
- She attacked me with her tail.
- It wasn't Ginger, baby.

204
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,955
- Yeah.
- It was some critter from the woods.

205
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,828
Ginger's dead, sweetheart.

206
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,909
You gotta let her go.

207
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,150
God.

208
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,478
Did you see anything back there?

209
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,955
When was the last time
you took a hit, Lace? Huh?

210
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,477
- It's not that, D.
- Tell me.

211
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,789
D, I swear to God, it's not that.

212
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,031
Hey, I saw some crazy shit.
First two days, I saw shit coming...

213
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,634
Baby, it's not that.

214
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:40,234
OK? I ain't had a hit
since day before yesterday.

215
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,628
I ain't seeing a goddamn thing.

216
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,916
She tried to get you with her tail, huh?

217
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,955
Fine. I'm gonna straighten you out.

218
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,919
I promise you, if that's the last thing
I do, I'm gonna straighten you out.

219
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,230
I'm gonna get you to Mexico, get you
drinks with fucking umbrellas in 'em.

220
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,518
Motherfuckin' radiator. Fuck!

221
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,588
One sure thing about luck is,
it will change.

222
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,348
Pull over.

223
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,515
- Hey, where are you going?
- Bathroom.

224
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,160
Just hold it.
It's only 30 miles to Platt.

225
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,638
I need to go.

226
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,153
You told me
you were gonna lay off the stuff.

227
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,515
And you told me fuckin' Mexico.

228
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,353
I just don't want you
getting cockeyed on me.

229
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,718
This whole fucking world is cockeyed.
I'm not gonna make a fuckin' difference.

230
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,790
Leave it.

231
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,755
<i>Turn it off.</i>

232
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,909
Tell me you can pump gas.

233
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,587
Let's go. Polly Watt,
we're going to buy coolant and crackers.

234
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,548
Keep a cool hand, Luke.

235
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,711
Hello?

236
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,631
Come on, come on. Fucking... Come on.

237
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,118
Come on.

238
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,435
OK. Come on, you fucking door!

239
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:22,317
Fuck!

240
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,711
Hello?

241
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,596
Fuck!

242
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,588
Hello?

243
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,189
They're making this easy, huh?

244
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,150
Fuck!

245
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
- Sorry. I didn't...
- Kill me.

246
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,029
Baby? Baby! Baby!

247
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,317
- What's going on?
- There's a man with spikes.

248
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,835
- Spikes?
- No, no, no, no, baby, please.

249
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,433
- Just listen!
- Do you even hear yourself talking?

250
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,593
Baby, in the bathroom, there's a man!
He's fucking...

251
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,628
What the fuck?

252
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,914
Lacey, get back. Lacey, get back!

253
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,751
Lacey!

254
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,238
Run!

255
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,478
Fuck!

256
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,999
Seth! Seth! Seth!

257
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,393
Run! Run! Hurry! Seth!

258
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,551
Get inside!

259
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:39,352
- Lacey!
- Are you OK? What was that?

260
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:45,195
- It just tore right through her.
- Oh, shit! Lacey!

261
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,829
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

262
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,116
No, no, no, no! What are you doing?

263
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,875
Don't think what's happening out there
changes who we are in here.

264
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,795
- You going to prison bothers me?
- I coulďve killed you. I didn't.

265
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,509
Yeah. We see how well
that worked out for you, don't we?

266
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,551
Stupid fuckin' idiot.
Plans don't change.

267
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,431
Hey, man.

268
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,589
You ain't no hero, kid.
We both know that.

269
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,390
<i>- Let me see.
- I'm OK.</i>

270
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,589
Are you OK?

271
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,558
Fuck!

272
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,878
Are you OK? Let me see.

273
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,400
What are you doing? Hey. Stop it.

274
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,710
She's alive.

275
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,268
Are you nuts?
You can't open that door, OK?

276
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,477
She's alive. Look.
I can't leave her out there.

277
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,310
No. She's...

278
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,028
Alright.

279
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,230
We'll watch the monitor, make sure
that thing on the car doesn't move.

280
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,992
You wanna tell me the rest?

281
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,790
Well, if...
if it goes to get you or whatever,

282
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,112
we're gonna shut that door, we're gonna
lock it and it's gonna stay shut.

283
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,314
You're OK.

284
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,314
- We can lock him out.
- He's got a gun.

285
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,710
- He can shoot through glass.
- Yeah, but he's out of bullets.

286
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,836
- It takes six, right?
- I don't know.

287
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,830
The girl shot two.
How many did he shoot?

288
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,398
What if he has more bullets? No.

289
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:53,237
Baby? Are you alright here, baby?

290
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,954
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

291
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,633
There you go. There you go.

292
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,759
- Seth, he's gonna kill us.
- Look, OK.

293
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,671
Just statistically speaking,

294
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:09,911
most people survive hostage situations
if you just stay calm.

295
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,115
Stay calm!

296
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,272
I'm just gonna take you inside,
alright? OK?

297
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,155
Just stay still. Stay still.

298
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,276
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

299
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,510
Jesus. She's dead.
He's completely insane.

300
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,548
OK, alright, I'm just gonna
drag you inside. Here we go.

301
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,228
Oh, my God.

302
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,238
- Come on.
- Polly, here he comes, OK?

303
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,835
Polly, open the door. We're gonna
get through this. Just be calm.

304
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,150
- You don't know that.
- Polly.

305
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,394
- Seth...
- Open the door.

306
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,517
- Open the door!
- Let him in. Polly, let him in.

307
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,989
- She's alive! Open the door!
- It's OK.

308
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,549
Open the door. He's right there!
Open the fucking door.

309
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,233
One!

310
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,311
- Two.
- It's OK. It's OK. No, no, no.

311
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,755
<i>Three.</i>

312
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,876
Don't! It's attacking him!
Don't open it!

313
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,750
<i>No! What is?
Seth, what is? What is that?</i>

314
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,115
Get away from it.

315
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,351
Seth, come on, man.

316
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,472
It's moving.
It's actually moving itself.

317
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,590
It's going for the blood.

318
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,628
- Don't. Come on. Don't.
- Wait.

319
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,073
You see this? It's following me.

320
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,154
It's actually following me.

321
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,991
Look at this.

322
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,592
Do you see that? It's... It's...

323
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,153
It's f...

324
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,994
It's metabolising.

325
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,512
<i>What?</i>

326
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,433
I can't believe this. I think
it's feeding. It's digesting the blood.

327
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,354
See the black stuff right there?
I think that's the waste.

328
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,355
- It was eating her?
- No.

329
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,036
It's absorbing...
the nutrients on a cellular...

330
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,554
It's more like a mould, I think.

331
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,835
What are you saying?
It feeds on people?

332
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,638
No. It probably feeds on any animal.

333
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,518
This is new. I've never seen
anything like this before.

334
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,353
<i>What is it?</i>

335
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,237
<i>I think... I think it's stopping.</i>

336
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,673
<i>What was that?</i>

337
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,750
What was that?

338
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,627
What the fuck?

339
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,237
Er, it's OK.

340
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,109
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Don't.

341
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,996
- Oh, Jesus.
- Don't. Come on. Don't.

342
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,277
I have to, OK? I have to. Just trust me.
Hey. Hey, man.

343
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,958
Look, you can't help her, OK?
It's not her any more.

344
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,155
Look, come on, man. Please.

345
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,355
You should come with us, OK?
Come with us.

346
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,155
You gotta come with me now, OK?
It's not her any more, alright?

347
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,036
Go, baby. It's OK.

348
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,913
<i>- Seth, come on!
- It's not her. We're coming.</i>

349
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,992
It's not her, OK? It's OK. Go. Go.

350
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,550
Help me get this open.

351
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,478
OK. Alright.

352
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,233
Shit! We need keys.

353
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,710
<i>Go. Go.</i>

354
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,552
Jesus.

355
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,958
Where?

356
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,472
Back door key.

357
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:25,318
Door key. Where's that door key?
Door key. Door key.

358
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,840
<i>Back door key.</i>

359
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,387
Where's the fucking key,
the back door key?

360
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,590
Shh. OK.

361
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,034
- Gotta pop the hinges.
- What?

362
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,759
- Screwdriver.
- What?

363
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,596
Seth! Seth, get me a screwdriver.

364
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,789
- Screwdriver?
- Give me a screwdriver!

365
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,594
<i>OK. Where would I be
if I were a screwdriver?</i>

366
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,237
Where...

367
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,911
<i>OK.</i>

368
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,510
The plan was to get her to Mexico,
get her clean.

369
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,188
We both wanted a baby.

370
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,634
We got a name in our minds.

371
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:32,677
It was definitely gonna be a baby girl.

372
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,596
We gotta get out of this gas station.

373
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,748
- I can't get it.
- Let me get it.

374
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,596
Hurry, baby. Hurry.

375
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,556
Are you ready? On three.
One, two, three. Stand back.

376
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,789
<i>- OK. OK.
- Over there.</i>

377
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,871
<i>OK.</i>

378
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,195
<i>- OK.
- What?</i>

379
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,795
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

380
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,436
It's gone.

381
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,318
<i>It's on the roof.</i>

382
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,557
We gotta go. Go, go, go, go.

383
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,478
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

384
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,518
It's stopped.

385
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,349
Let's go.

386
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,907
- No, no, no.
- Don't move! Stay there.

387
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,114
OK.

388
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,795
<i>- Shit.
- Look, you gotta help us.</i>

389
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,713
- There's something out there.
- You're under arrest.

390
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,155
Drop the gun.
Put your hands on your head.

391
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,471
Look, you're not listening.
There's something out there!

392
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,027
Got every state trooper
looking for you, Farell.

393
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,112
None of them would mind
taking you out of here feet first.

394
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,793
Ma'am, you really have to
get in your car, OK?

395
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,358
- Go! Go, please!
- Right now.

396
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,432
It's OK. I'm here now. You two are safe.
He's not gonna try anything stupid.

397
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,273
- It's not safe. Get in your car.
- I'll be alright.

398
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,315
Get in your car!

399
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,393
Jesus!

400
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,309
- Jesus! What did you do?
- Just get in your car.

401
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,474
Listen to me. You're gonna get
in your car right now and call this in.

402
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,791
Wake the whole goddamn state
if you have to.

403
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,429
Tell them you've got
a hostage situation on your hands.

404
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,670
- I'm calling it in.
- Yeah.

405
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,355
But I'm not going anywhere.
5-14, come in.

406
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,398
- Please get in your car. Please!
- 5-14, come in.

407
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,916
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
We're gonna get you out of there.

408
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,275
5-14, come in.

409
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,550
- Boyd!
- It's too late.

410
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,757
Boyd! Are you there?

411
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,672
Run! Run! Get out of there right now!

412
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,914
Get away!

413
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,876
It... It took half of her.

414
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,670
It killed her. It killed her!

415
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,876
- Seth!
- It's OK. It's OK.

416
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,474
It killed her. It killed the other girl.

417
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,789
It killed everything.

418
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,110
And it's gonna get in here.
It's gonna kill us.

419
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,793
- No, it's not.
- It's gonna kill us!

420
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,471
It's gonna kill us.

421
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,759
Her car's just right there.
We should make a run for it.

422
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,628
Shit. That thing's way faster
than we are.

423
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,391
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

424
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,630
But we got a gun and we got a bat.

425
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,871
A gun and a bat ain't gonna do shit.

426
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,278
You got a firecracker
on your hands here.

427
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,391
Lacey was like that.

428
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,157
I'm nothing like your white-trash,
drugged-out girlfriend.

429
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,356
- Firecracker.
- How is this helping exactly?

430
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,829
- Easy, lady. Help can't even help us.
- We have to do something.

431
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,389
OK. Let's, er... Let's just start
with what we know, OK?

432
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,869
We don't know shit, Seth.
We know it attacks you and you die.

433
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,032
No, we know that that thing infected his
girlfriend, so it's a parasite, right?

434
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,396
It... It uses its host for mobility.
It consumes you.

435
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,507
- It's... It's like a fungus or a mould.
- OK, so what are you saying?

436
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,074
I don't know.

437
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,152
So what you're saying is,
it attacks you and you die.

438
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,355
She called it in, right?
So someone's gonna come.

439
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,949
She called it in.

440
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,396
- Nobody's coming.
- How do you know that?

441
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,391
She said they were looking for you.
There's a manhunt on.

442
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,869
Not here, there ain't.
Down south there will be.

443
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,077
- They think I'm headed to Mexico.
- You are going to Mexico.

444
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:29,717
<i>Yeah.</i>

445
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,313
I'm going north. Platt first.

446
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,471
Great.

447
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,351
Wonderful.

448
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,431
<i>It's perfect.</i>

449
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:58,675
- Perfect.
- What? What's perfect?

450
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,275
We're in state forest,
a national treasure, right?

451
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,394
<i>Yeah.</i>

452
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,472
There's ten feet
between the building and the trees.

453
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,757
Oil runs down the steps,
across the dirt, into the trees.

454
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,630
You wanna set the forest on fire?

455
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:20,396
- Light it up and wait for the sirens.
- It won't work. Motor oil won't burn.

456
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,675
But there is lighter fluid
by the barbecue supplies.

457
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,989
- You...
- Firecracker.

458
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,436
Wait. This is insane. You realise
the fire's gonna come right back at us?

459
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,159
- It won't.
- What?

460
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,117
Here.

461
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,594
Give me one more. Thanks.

462
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,590
Just wait. Just wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What if it's outside the door right now?

463
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,831
Can we just stop
and think this through for a second?

464
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,911
This'll work.

465
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,831
Look, any way you slice it,
we're gonna be leaving a trail

466
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,514
of flammable liquid
back into this building.

467
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,831
This is a gas station. We're sitting on
a giant tank of gasoline.

468
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,434
I know. But if we get fire trucks
out here, someone'll kill that thing.

469
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:15,637
<i>Being trapped in
a burning building, I don't like that.</i>

470
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,791
Your parasitic mould theory
isn't really working right now.

471
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,235
So if you've got another idea,
go ahead.

472
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,195
It's working!

473
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:44,394
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

474
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,710
All we have to do is grab it.
Take no more than three seconds.

475
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,268
Yeah, three seconds is all it needs.

476
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,072
OK.

477
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:32,632
OK.

478
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,753
What are you thinking?

479
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,360
Here's what we're gonna do.
Tape these together,

480
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,637
snake it outside, hook the receiver,
bring it up, make the call.

481
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,315
No open doors,
no being outside, no fires, OK?

482
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:01,831
OK.

483
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,398
Right there. Hm-hm.

484
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,547
OK.

485
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,634
<i>I don't think it's long enough.</i>

486
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,719
You OK?

487
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,755
Yeah.

488
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,273
I just cut myself.

489
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,990
<i>- Think he's got it.
- There you go.</i>

490
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,637
<i>You got it.</i>

491
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,630
<i>Fuck.</i>

492
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,831
Hm-hm.

493
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:15,076
<i>You got it right there.</i>

494
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,309
<i>- OK, you got it.
- Grab it. Hold it.</i>

495
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,358
<i>You got it. You got it.</i>

496
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,476
<i>There you go, man.
Keep pulling. There you go.</i>

497
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,911
Pull it up slowly.

498
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,110
There you go.

499
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,994
There you go. Nice and easy.

500
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,114
<i>Come on.</i>

501
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,717
<i>- There you go.
- You got it. Be careful.</i>

502
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,715
Holy fuck! Holy fuck.

503
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,360
You got it. You got it. Hold onto it.

504
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,672
<i>You gotta hold on. Hold on.</i>

505
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,998
<i>Polly!</i>

506
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,277
Polly! Stop! Polly!

507
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,155
Let's go! Come on!

508
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,150
It's breaking in.
It's breaking in. It's breaking in.

509
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,599
It's gone.

510
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:33,873
It took her legs.

511
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:39,918
- Jesus Christ.
- Why would it do that?

512
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:44,789
Where'd he go?

513
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,590
- My God, do you think it got to him?
- I don't see how it would have.

514
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,592
<i>- Hey.
- Seth, I think he made a run for it.</i>

515
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,150
The front door's still locked.
Maybe he's in back.

516
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,358
Seth. Seth.

517
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,318
- He's not back there.
- What is it?

518
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,030
<i>Don't move.</i>

519
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,552
What is it doing?

520
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,989
Run. Run!

521
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,150
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

522
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:44,552
Seth!

523
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,311
Watch the splinters.
Don't let it stick you.

524
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,233
<i>- Go, Polly.
- Come on.</i>

525
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,550
Go! Go!

526
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,512
Fuck off!

527
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,355
Move away from the glass.

528
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,231
It'll forget.

529
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,393
- How did you know that?
- There's nothing smart about it.

530
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,472
- I think he's right.
- Yeah, but it chased us in here.

531
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,554
It tracks us somehow,
but it ain't thinking.

532
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,911
I think it moves on instinct.
It's like at a cellular level,

533
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,277
it's like a plant root
trying to find water.

534
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,032
Yeah, but why can't it track us in here?

535
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,233
I don't know.

536
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,155
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

537
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,199
- It's OK.
- Are you OK?

538
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,068
<i>- It's alright.
- What is it? Did it get you?</i>

539
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:14,273
<i>Goddamn!</i>

540
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,918
Alright, don't let it touch you.

541
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:25,275
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
- Don't touch it!

542
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,510
- Here, let me just see.
- Don't touch it!

543
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,193
- Get away from it!
- Listen...

544
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:36,269
- You gotta...
- Stay away from it!

545
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,677
Oh, God!

546
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,909
Oh, my God!

547
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,795
- Give me the knife.
- Fuck me.

548
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,952
It's spreading.
I'm gonna have to cut it.

549
00:54:57,559 --> 00:54:59,391
Knife.

550
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,552
<i>- Get the knife, OK?
- OK.</i>

551
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,431
- Give me the knife!
- OK.

552
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,192
- Oh, God.
- OK.

553
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,835
- What do we do?
- We have to cut it.

554
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,150
- What?
- Get something to hold his arm with.

555
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,628
Grab that thing right there. Get it.

556
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,557
Try to cover his arm.
Don't let any of those touch you, OK?

557
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,871
<i>OK. OK. OK.</i>

558
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,438
<i>- I'm just gonna tie this off.
- Don't let it touch you.</i>

559
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:47,952
Hurry.

560
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:50,110
- This is it?
- Yeah.

561
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:53,628
- Hurry!
- OK.

562
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,556
It's OK. It's OK.
We're cutting your arm off.

563
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,994
- OK.
- Cut faster.

564
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,391
- Fuck!
- Go!

565
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,469
I can't get through the bone
with this knife.

566
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:19,594
What?

567
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,998
What are we gonna do?

568
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:28,869
Seth? What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

569
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,990
<i>- Alright, on three. One.
- Do it.</i>

570
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:37,275
Two.

571
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,717
Three.

572
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,679
It started with that splinter
I got from the flat tyre.

573
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,833
What we ran over was just the same
as that thing out there.

574
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,911
That's all it took.

575
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:14,036
Looks like I underestimated you.

576
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:18,398
He can't change a tyre,
but fuck if he can't chop off an arm.

577
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,914
Yeah, he's a keeper.

578
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:26,759
This one, she locks me out
and leaves me for dead.

579
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,990
Hell, I never dreamed this thing
would turn into a ménage ř trois.

580
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:36,072
I'd just as soon die with you two
as anybody else.

581
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:39,476
I'll drink to that.

582
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:42,027
I wish we'd have made it to Mexico, man.

583
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:46,750
- I wish we'd never gone camping.
- Shut up. We're not dying in here.

584
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,115
This is not over.
We just gotta get him to a hospital.

585
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:53,396
- There's one in Platt, right?
- Don't know. Never been there.

586
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,994
That's just the place
Lacey was stashing my nest egg.

587
00:57:58,239 --> 00:57:59,831
You two never read about me?

588
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,670
- You shot a cop?
- No.

589
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,510
They shot me.

590
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,317
I was stealing big rigs.

591
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:17,108
Then this last time, I was working
on a five-day straight mid-high.

592
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,637
I asked this guy to give up his keys.
He didn't and I shot him.

593
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,871
Didn't kill him straight away,
just shattered his spine.

594
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,032
He died about a year later, and by then,
him and his old lady had gone bankrupt

595
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:36,318
from all the medical bills
and I was sitting in the penitentiary.

596
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,398
I know how it sounds.

597
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,757
I just figured if I ever got out,
I'd do two things.

598
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,150
I'd get my ass
across the border with Lacey

599
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,231
and make sure his wife
was taken care of.

600
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,157
You were gonna give your nest egg
to that trucker's wife?

601
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,554
I know it sounds foolish, but...

602
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,949
...I figured if I ever got
a second chance, she should too.

603
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,989
Isn't he the strangest one-armed convict
you've ever met?

604
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:27,039
- Baby?
- Temperature.

605
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,797
- I have to check something.
- What?

606
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,518
<i>We gotta chance it.</i>

607
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:53,510
Seth.

608
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:03,833
- I don't see it.
- Stay ready.

609
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:08,108
Maybe it rejoined the big one.

610
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,159
<i>Do you see it?</i>

611
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,952
Seth.

612
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:44,476
Do you see it?

613
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:12,152
Now, watch this.
Now, this has been stuck in my head.

614
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:14,231
<i>Watch out!</i>

615
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,472
Why does it give up on me
and go straight for the car?

616
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:26,077
<i>- Watch out!
- See, it just hits the car.</i>

617
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:29,516
It doesn't turn after me.
I don't think it was ever going for me.

618
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,990
It was going for the car cos the car
was hotter. I think it tracks with heat.

619
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:38,998
It's a simple organism
and it's just looking for food.

620
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:41,195
It goes for the warmest thing
and kills it.

621
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,476
The engine was overheated, right?
So it was way hotter than me.

622
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,755
It can't track us in the refrigerator.

623
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,230
Exactly. It's too cold.
We're invisible to it.

624
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,230
All I have to do is walk to the
sheriff's car and bring it to the door.

625
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,871
No. That thing would be on you
in three seconds. You said so yourself.

626
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,509
Yeah, but not if my temperature
was below the ambient temperature.

627
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:08,954
The human body can drop
to 32 degrees Celsius

628
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,829
before medical emergency occurs,
so that's 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

629
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,876
Thank God for global warming in July.

630
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,110
All we have to do is keep
my body temperature below 93 degrees.

631
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:21,793
I'll be like a fucking ghost
to that thing.

632
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,711
What about the medical emergency?

633
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:42,550
<i>95.</i>

634
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,755
Seth, you're gonna kill yourself.

635
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,990
Not if you keep me above 89.6.

636
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,594
Here, gotta get this hand cold.

637
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,947
You don't have to prove anything to me.

638
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,954
I know.

639
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:21,668
But if we don't get out of here,
I'm never gonna...

640
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,193
We'll never get to show that tent
who's boss.

641
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:34,510
Try it again.

642
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,512
94.

643
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:02,275
You don't wanna do too much of that.
You're gonna warm up my lips.

644
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,070
Shut up.

645
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,550
You're gonna be OK.

646
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,233
<i>Just a couple more degrees.</i>

647
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,989
Almost ready.

648
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,268
We're gonna use these fireworks
to keep that thing off you, OK?

649
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,748
- Got enough?
- Yeah.

650
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,233
Hey, make sure she's ready
when I bring the car around, OK?

651
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,594
She usually takes forever with that.

652
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,876
No, no, no, don't touch me.
You're gonna warm me up.

653
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:48,036
Come back.

654
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,108
You know I will.

655
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,637
I love you.

656
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:56,710
I love you, too.

657
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,039
Next year's gonna be better, I promise.

658
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,710
Next year Hawaii.

659
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,632
Alright, go! Go! Go!

660
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,311
Damn it.

661
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,027
Come on, buddy. You gotta go faster.

662
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,034
He's gonna need more time.

663
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,155
- He's almost there.
- There you go.

664
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,755
Hey, fireworks.

665
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,429
I don't see it!

666
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,594
Where'd it go?

667
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,110
Hello.

668
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:06,829
Hello.

669
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,750
<i>Polly! I don't see it.</i>

670
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,319
Oh, God. Oh, God.

671
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,550
- Seth!
- Polly!

672
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,875
Seth!

673
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,591
<i>Dennis!</i>

674
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,791
Come on! Get up! Get up!

675
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,069
Polly? Come on.

676
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:19,395
Where'd it go? Do you see it?

677
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:20,673
No.

678
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:02,792
Hold it.

679
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:15,395
What? Hey!

680
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:25,074
Hey!

681
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:34,269
Shit!

682
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,149
Seth! Seth!

683
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,268
The fire.

684
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:52,430
We gotta get it in the fire!

685
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,430
Fuck. Polly!

686
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,390
Polly!

687
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,756
Here!

688
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,954
- Are you sure?
- Here!

689
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,189
Go.

690
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:19,270
Go!

691
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,478
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Keep going.

692
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:38,550
Keep running.

693
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:39,679
<i>Fuck it.</i>

694
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,954
Dennis.

695
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:47,030
Go. Go.

696
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,551
Let me see him.

697
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:57,913
- Oh, no.
- What you gonna cut off now, Doc?

698
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,677
Here. Take this.

699
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,557
Take it to the bank in Platt.

700
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,796
Give it all to her.

701
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:23,515
<i>- Now, you two, make it count.
- OK.</i>

702
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,238
<i>Now, get the fuck out of here.</i>

703
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:40,310
Come on.

704
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,835
<i>- Let's go.
- Go on.</i>

705
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,717
<i>- Get out of here.
- Come on, Polly.</i>

706
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:49,475
Polly, come on.

707
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,188
I love you.

708
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:04,547
Fuck it.

709
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,155
Fuck it.

710
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:21,237
Here I come, baby.

711
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,516
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

712
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,159
Now, we're gonna get you warmed up.

713
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,231
<i>Just tell me
if you see any fire trucks.</i>

714
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:51,756
<i>Yeah, OK.
Well, I see a post oak.</i>

715
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,752
<i>- It's gotta be 300 years old.
- It's not a post oak.</i>

716
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,274
<i>- No?
- It's just a tree. Keep walking.</i>

717
01:15:57,359 --> 01:15:59,157
<i>OK.</i>
