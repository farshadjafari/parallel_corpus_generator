1
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,915
One early morning.

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,749
Lifting the dark
misty veil of the night.

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,749
From the pillow of its mountain
peak, the sun rose and saw..

4
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,915
The valley is filled
with the season of love.

5
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,999
And the branches of
memories have sprouted..

6
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,582
..innumerable
blossoms of past moments.

7
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,082
Unspoken, unheard yearnings.

8
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,749
Half asleep, half awake.
Rubbing its eyes, it watches.

9
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:14,332
As it flows in wave after wave..

10
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,749
At once new, also the same.

11
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:26,915
Yes, the very same life which
encompasses love and desire.

12
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:33,915
Meeting and also parting.
And a sense..

13
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,999
..that time is flowing like a river,
whispering as it flows..

14
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:43,915
..that the valley is
filled with the season of love.

15
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,999
And the branches of
memories have sprouted..

16
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,915
..innumerable blossoms
of the past moments.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,999


18
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:15,832
"Why is the wind singing today"

19
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,915
"Why is the wind singing?"

20
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,915
"Why is the season raining colours?"

21
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,915
"My heart wonders what
is going to happen today."

22
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,665
"Why is there moonlight in the day?"

23
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:58,582
"Which way is life moving?"

24
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,582
"My heart wonders what
these events foretell."

25
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:13,749
"Why is the wind singing today?"

26
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:45,749
"Whose face am l
seeing in every flower?"

27
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:59,915
"Whose face do
l see in every flower?"

28
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:09,749
"Whose unheard voice
is in my ears?"

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,582
"Whose are these sounds.."

30
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:19,499
"..vibrating in my dreams?"

31
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:24,665
"My heart wonders
whose arrival is awaited."

32
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,082
"Why is the wind singing.."

33
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:34,749
Singing, singing.."

34
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:41,165
'Oh, Allah.'

35
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,040
Today, your dream is
coming true, Papa.

36
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,415
Today, your daughter
begins her first case.

37
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,749
You devoted your entire life
for truth and human rights.

38
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,249
Today, l am taking my first
step into the same battlefield.

39
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,665
As always, l'm taking your
faith and blessings with me.

40
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:51,165
Karim Khan, do you know
how to cook?

41
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,665
No, sir, the wife cooks.

42
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,999
Better start learning.

43
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,999
Now, women have started
doing men's jobs. Never know..

44
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,915
..when you'll have to
sleep on an empty stomach.

45
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,332
Now, may l meet the lndian prisoner?

46
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:15,082
Most certainly. Now, you
haνe the right to, Madam Lawyer.

47
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,915
Come, l'll escort you myself.

48
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,749
That way l'll get to spend a
little more time with you.

49
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,082
Shall we?

50
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,499
Excuse me, madam, but
you're wasting your time.

51
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:35,999
This man is here since 22 years,
but no one's heard him..

52
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,582
..utter a single word.

53
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,332
We think he is νery happy here,
neνer fights, never complains..

54
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,915
..seems like he doesn't
want to be free at all.

55
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,582
Freedom is every
man's birthright and..

56
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,665
..it's my duty to see
that he gets it.

57
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,165
You do your duty and
let me do mine.

58
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,040
Hey, 786. Look who's
come to meet you.

59
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:09,915
You imbecile, Madam Lawyer
is here, at least greet her.

60
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,999
The State of Pakistan has
decided to reopen cases..

61
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,832
..of some lndian prisoners.

62
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,915
So, find your lost voice
quickly and start babbling.

63
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,332
This opportunity won't come again.

64
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,749
What did l tell you?
- Open the cell.

65
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,165
l want to speak to him in private.

66
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,582
Well, you've signed the papers,
what do l care?

67
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,665
Karim Khan, keep an eye on her.

68
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:52,999
l've done my duty, now
it's up to you and..

69
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,915
..your God.

70
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,499
Let's begin with names.

71
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,165
l'm Saamiya Siddique and you are..

72
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,499
Do you want me to call
you 786 like the others do?

73
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,749
Your name can't be so unpleasant
that you prefer a number to it?

74
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,499
Veer Pratap Singh.

75
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,165
lt's ages since you've
heard your name, isn't it?

76
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,332
Please talk to me, Veer Pratap
Singh. l've come to help you.

77
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:08,415
22 years ago you remained silent.
And no one could defend you.

78
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,749
Today, God is giving you
another chance. Talk to me..

79
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,582
..and l promise to get
you back to your country.

80
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,665
Please talk to me. Please.

81
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,582
l don't know why you
don't want your freedom.

82
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,165
But l want you to know why..

83
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,915
..your freedom is important for me
and other girls of this country.

84
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:48,040
My father fought his entire life
for women's empowerment in Pakistan.

85
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,499
But he could not do as
much as he wanted to.

86
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,749
Today, after years of hard work,
l have earned my first case.

87
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,915
But everyone knows it's
impossible to win this case.

88
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,915
They want me to lose..

89
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:14,415
..so that no woman will tread
into this male domain again.

90
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,915
But l'm not going to lose.

91
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,332
l will not let down my father's
dream. Or the women of my country.

92
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,665
l just need your help. Talk to me..

93
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,082
Please talk to me.

94
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,915
Talk to me, Veer Pratap Singh.

95
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,915
That's an F 1 6 flying
at the speed of 1 200mph.

96
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:33,999
When a plane tears through the
skies, plays with the clouds..

97
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:41,915
..no one but a pilot can
understand that feeling.

98
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:53,999
l can still feel
my hands throbbing..

99
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:59,915
..the blood rushing
and the winds lashing..

100
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:08,665
..when l would take my helicopter..

101
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,915
..into the mountains.

102
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,415
Ahead.. left..

103
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,915
Help. Help, help please.

104
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,665
Let's go get them.

105
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,249
Help.

106
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,665
This was me and this was my life.

107
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,415
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

108
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,749
A rescue pilot with
the lndian Air Force.

109
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,915
l loved my work.

110
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,999
Flying was a childhood fantasy.
And saνing people's lives..

111
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,165
..was my father's legacy.
He was an army officer..

112
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,332
..who gaνe his life for the country.

113
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,832
l was alone and free.

114
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,499
And l lived every moment
as if it were the last.

115
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,999
Little did l know
that three days later..

116
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,665
..my life was going to
change because of a girl.

117
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,499
A girl who was then
sound asleep in Pakistan.

118
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,749
Wake up, Zaara. lt's seven o'clock.

119
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,082
Seven. l've never
woken up this early..

120
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,999
Whatever has not happened till now..

121
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,582
..will begin from today. Your
marriage got fixed yesterday.

122
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,165
Now, you're just a
guest here for some time.

123
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,165
Soon, you'll have to go
to your husband's house.

124
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,499
Your mother wants you
to change your habits.

125
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,749
Wake up every morning at seven,
make your own bed.

126
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,915
Then learn cooking
from uncle lqbal..

127
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,165
l'm not going to change
for anyone.

128
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,332
l am who l am, tell them that.

129
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,165
Oh, your cool
attitude won't work anymore.

130
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,582
You're lucky they've chosen
you because of your beauty.

131
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,915
l hope your manners
won't turn them away.

132
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,915
Or you'll be a spinster for life.

133
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:01,999


134
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:29,332
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

135
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:34,415
"Whether someone is happy,
or even if they are unhappy."

136
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,332
"l will neνer change my style."

137
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,915
"Whether they understand or
they don't, l will keep saying."

138
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:53,915
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

139
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:47,749
"l am the princess of my
feelings and the queen of my mind."

140
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,665
"Why should l wear a veil?
lf the scarf drops, let it."

141
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:57,915
"Whether they smile or they pout.."

142
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:02,582
"lt does not bother me if
what l say causes a rift."

143
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:12,499
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

144
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,582
"l have no desire to
adorn my palms with henna."

145
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,582
"Or to hear the wedding flute play."

146
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,999
"l have no desire to
adorn my palms with henna."

147
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,915
"Or to hear the wedding flute play."

148
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,915
"l am quite happy in
my own home, thank you."

149
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,915
"lf you can hear me, oh priest,
let me clarify."

150
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,749
"l don't know that l will
ever agree to marriage."

151
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:40,499
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

152
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,499
"Whether anybody's happy or upset.."

153
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,332
".. l won't change myself."

154
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:54,915
"People might agree or they
might not, l won't budge."

155
00:19:55,166 --> 00:20:05,165
"l am the way l am
and l will always be."

156
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,249
Dr. Yusuf, is everything all right?

157
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,749
Just pray. Now, there's no
time to take her to the hospital.

158
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,165
She's repeatedly asking for Zaara.

159
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,582
Yusuf, l'm Zaara's mother but it's
Bebe (grandma) who brought her up.

160
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,665
Where is Zaara?

161
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,749
She's gone to the temple
to get holy water for Bebe.

162
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,165
l'll break this news to Zaara,
no one will say anything to her.

163
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,915
Zaara, is that you?

164
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,999
Yes, Bebe, your Zaara has come and..

165
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,749
..look what she's got for you.

166
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,999
The priest sent special holy water
for you and.. - l know, little one.

167
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,832
No holy water will help me now.
- Bebe..

168
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,582
Since you were a child, you
haνe been chattering non stop.

169
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,332
And l have been listening. Today,
l'm going to speak.

170
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,082
And you'll listen.

171
00:21:54,916 --> 00:22:00,665
You know that l've been here ever
since the inception of Pakistan.

172
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,999
l was 1 6-years-old when
your grandfather left lndia..

173
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:10,040
..and he came to Pakistan and
he brought me along with him.

174
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,749
Your family, this
country has given me lots..

175
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,665
..and l took it all
with all my heart.

176
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:24,749
But today, l've this one
last wish.. will you fulfil it?

177
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:31,915
lmmerse my ashes in my lndia, dear.

178
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:39,499
l may be an orphan, but l am an
lndian. That's my only identity.

179
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,999
l told you about Kiritpur,
haνen't l? For us Sikhs..

180
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,915
..it's a very important pilgrimage.

181
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,665
All my ancestors are there.

182
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:55,915
Just immerse me there.
l will get my refuge.

183
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,915
You'll do this for me?

184
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,165
No.

185
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,332
There's going to be no
need to do any such thing.

186
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,415
All our visas to go
to Delhi are ready.

187
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:18,499
You just get well soon. Then
we'll both go to your Kiritpur.

188
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,582
And you can pray there
to your heart's content.

189
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,749
Now, drink this holy water quickly.

190
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:35,499
Bebe..

191
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,749
She was here in
Pakistan and you in lndia.

192
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,249
Then how and when did
the two of you meet?

193
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:18,249
Three.. three days later..

194
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:26,249
..and what an unusual
meeting it was.

195
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,249
Hurry up. Hurry up.

196
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,415
A bus had toppled
over in the mountains.

197
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,915
There were no serious casualties.
All passengers were rescued.

198
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:46,249
And l was on my way down
to bring the last girl up.

199
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,499
Pull us up.

200
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,915
lt wasn't that l'd never seen
a more beautiful girl than her.

201
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:33,499
But l don't know why l
couldn't take my eyes off her.

202
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:38,332
Her eyes were lowered and
she was breathing heavily.

203
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,582
She was very scared.

204
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,499
A strand of hair was
bothering her right eye.

205
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,999
She was trying to move it,
but the wind was strong and..

206
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,165
..the hair stayed there.

207
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,332
As l lifted my hand from
her waist to move the hair..

208
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,082
..she looked at me in fear.

209
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:04,249
We looked at each
other for the first time.

210
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,082
She kept staring at me scared.

211
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:12,915
Then she lowered her gaze, but..

212
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:17,415
l kept staring at her and
then my dream was broken.

213
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,249
Stop.. stop.. stop

214
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,582
Ranjit. Stop.

215
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,165
What happened?

216
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,582
What happened?
- My bag has fallen down.

217
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,165
Please take me down.
- lt's only a bag, ma'am. Let it go.

218
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,332
l can't let it go. That
bag is very inνaluable to me.

219
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,832
Not more valuable than all
our lives, right? - Yes, it is.

220
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:42,165
Now, will you please take me
down or should l go myself? - Down.

221
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,332
My bag.

222
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,749
Stop it.

223
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,165
Ranjit, take it down.
- Veer, have you gone mad?

224
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,915
Do as l say. Take us down.

225
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,415
Here.

226
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,165
Ranjit, pull us up.

227
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,915
You endangered the liνes of so
many people for a little bag.

228
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,999
What kind of a person are you?

229
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,999
You know we risk our lives
everyday to save liνes..

230
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,999
..of people who are
complete strangers..

231
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:35,249
..who aren't related to us
in any way.

232
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,999
Yet on our way home, our
hearts swell with pride..

233
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,999
..that we saved someone's sister,
wife, brother or mother.

234
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,249
Gave someone a new life.

235
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,999
But today, for the first
time in so many years..

236
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,165
..l'm doubting my work.

237
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,999
For the first time,
sacrificing my life..

238
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,999
..for someone else
is seeming worthless.

239
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,165
lt's seeming wrong.

240
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,749
l'm sorry, ma'am,
but it was disgusting.

241
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,582
Get out. l don't
want to see your face.

242
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,415
Who asked you to
give Zaara your money?

243
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,665
You know l can't say no to Zaara.

244
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,165
Even if l did, she
would've taken it forcibly.

245
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:23,999
And she's not off to the market
to buy bangles, but to lndia.

246
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,999
Wasn't it important
enough to tell me?

247
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,082
She made me pledge our friendship.

248
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,332
Pledge of friendship.
There's a limit to childishness.

249
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,915
Who got her onto the bus?
Call Akram.

250
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,249
Call him immediately.
How irresponsible!

251
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:44,332
Zaara.. Zaara, are you all right?
- Zaara..

252
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,749
Mother, l'm perfectly all right,
please don't worry.

253
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:52,665
What is this nonsense, Zaara?
Do you know what l'm going through?

254
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:57,415
Only when l was going to the police
that this idiot Shabbo told me.

255
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,415
Just come back home right away.
Come home immediately.

256
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,999
Mother, the border closes at 4.30..

257
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,165
..and l haven't even
reached Kiritpur yet.

258
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,999
God, for what sin am
l being punished?

259
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,749
Now, it's about to be evening.

260
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,249
Why did you go alone?

261
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,165
l promised you that
l would send the ashes to lndia.

262
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,332
l also promised Bebe that
l would take her ashes myself.

263
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,999
Zaara, is this a little
trip from Lahore to Pindi..

264
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,499
..that you just took off like that?

265
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,832
Have you gone mad?

266
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:27,999
l'm really sorry, Mother.

267
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:33,082
But after all my explaining, you
were still unable to understand me.

268
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:38,082
Until now, l've done nothing
really important in my life, Mother.

269
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,915
Nor will l be doing
anything great in the future.

270
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:48,749
My life, like yours, will be spent
being a good wife and a good mother.

271
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,915
But after doing this, l will
always be proud of myself.

272
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,749
That l helped
someone attain salvation.

273
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,999
Mother, now that l've come so far..

274
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,415
..l will return only
after completing my work.

275
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,165
But if you stay angry with me,
then my journey will get bad luck..

276
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,332
Stop it. Can a mother ever
wish bad luck for her daughter?

277
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,915
l've been crying since eight hours,
you want me to cry some more?

278
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,915
Relax, Mother. l'm cool.

279
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,165
Yes, you're the only one
who's cool and we're all fools.

280
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,165
lf your father returns
before you do, then..

281
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,415
Don't worry, Mother.

282
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,665
Papa will only be back next week,
and l'm coming back tomorrow.

283
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,915
Please.

284
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,915
Mother, l've to hang up now.
There's a long queue.

285
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,082
Listen, take care of yourself,
and don't eat any junk.

286
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:42,415
And don't talk to any strangers
and keep calling me.. right?

287
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:47,999
And don't be scared, my
blessings are with you. Goodbye.

288
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,499
Goodbye.

289
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,165
Yes, how much?

290
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,082
Why are you worrying?

291
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,749
Our Zaara is no less than any boy.
She can get her way anywhere.

292
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:03,749
Thank God that she's safe, this
girl scared the life out of me.

293
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,082
Why are you talking to me? l
told you to get out of my sight.

294
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,832
You say that all the time.
Now, cool it.

295
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,749
Cool it, my foot! You fool.

296
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,832
Go do your work. What are you
standing like statues for? Go..

297
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,582
Ranjit, permission for my
leave has come from the base.

298
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,915
Mom and dad had asked me to come
home to celebrate Lodi (festival).

299
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,832
l'll leave from here in the morning,
that way l'll reach sooner.

300
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,540
Negi will accompany you back.

301
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,999
Okay, see you on Monday. Enjoy..
- Thank you. Here are the logs..

302
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:38,332
Mister, are there any
buses to Kiritpur from here?

303
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,082
No, Ma'am, no buses
leaving right now.

304
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,582
There's one for Kiritpur at 7am.

305
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,915
ls there a hotel where
l can spend the night?

306
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,749
Hotel. Of course. Look there's
Kake's inn. Our five-star hotel.

307
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,999
For Rs. 1 0, you'll get a blanket.

308
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,165
You'll get a cot for Rs.25.

309
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,832
Okay, ma'am. Please excuse me,
l'm getting late. Goodnight

310
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:12,999
"Love is God's blessing,
don't turn away from it.

311
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,082
The ascent of moon doesn't stop."

312
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:26,082
"Why hide it?"

313
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:32,999
"Love can never be hidden, Jaggiya."

314
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,082
You risk your life to
save the liνes of strangers.

315
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,999
There can't be nobler
work than that.

316
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:52,499
l would not like you to stop taking
pride in your work because of me.

317
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,749
That's why l've come to tell
you the reason for my behaviour.

318
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,499
These are the ashes of my Bebe.

319
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,332
She was an lndian..

320
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,749
..who spent her whole life in
Pakistan serving my family..

321
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,082
..and never asked
for anything in return.

322
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,999
Just one dying wish..

323
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:18,915
..that her ashes be immersed along
with her ancestors in Kiritpur.

324
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,582
This is more
important to me than my life.

325
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,082
Perhaps, you were not
happy saving my life.

326
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,999
But l am sure you'll be proud that..

327
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:36,665
..you saved this urn
that was in my bag.

328
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,582
Please try to forgive me.

329
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,415
l'm sorry.

330
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,499
Sir, here's your buttermilk.
- Thanks.

331
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:02,082
lf only l'd drunk it in the morning,
l wouldn't have lost my temper then.

332
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,999
Here's the bus.

333
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,749
One by one. Who has tickets?

334
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:22,582
l've got a ticket..
- Ladies first. No pushing.

335
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,915
Easy..

336
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,165
Easy.. easy. No crowding.

337
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,665
That's it. No more.
- But l've got a ticket.

338
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,665
Madam, everyone has a ticket but
here it's first-come-first-sit.

339
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,499
So, where do l go then?
- Go up there..

340
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:47,082
Hey, baldy, move oνer there.
- Why should l moνe?

341
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,999
ls my wife your sister that..

342
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,332
..you want to sit beside
her for the entire journey?

343
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:57,415
Shove, before l break your teeth.
- Sir, l was just moving.

344
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,499
You must be wondering
what am l doing here.

345
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:09,999
Can you see that bus over there?

346
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:15,665
Actually l should've
been on that bus.

347
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,999
l had boarded it. But l
noticed you and l saw..

348
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:23,332
..how graciously you
took this wonderful seat.

349
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,999
l thought to myself either
you are extremely brave or..

350
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,582
..extremely foolish to do this
long journey all by yourself.

351
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,082
Then l realised that..

352
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,999
..although l'll reach my village,
l'll be bothered..

353
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,999
..throughout my journey..

354
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,999
..and probably for my
entire life whether..

355
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,999
..that silly Pakistani girl reached
her destination safe and sound.

356
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:50,332
So, please don't think
that l've come to help you.

357
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,999
l'm simply ensuring your
thoughts don't bother me..

358
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,249
..for the rest of my life.

359
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,332
Thank you.

360
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,165
Would you like to eat some nuts?

361
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,915
By the way, l'm Squadron
Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

362
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,665
l'm Zaara. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

363
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:21,457


364
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,249
"Below the blue skies."

365
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,915
"The earth is prospering."

366
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,165
"Every season is joyful."

367
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,415
"Oh, my beautiful land."

368
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,832
"My land. My land."

369
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:52,499
"Oh, my beautiful land."

370
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:56,915
"My land. My land."

371
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:17,165
"The earth is golden,
the skies are blue."

372
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,499
"And every season is colourful."

373
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:30,665
"This is my land."

374
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:40,332
"The sparrow hawk calls
and the nightingale sings."

375
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:44,665
"And the monsoon clouds arrive.
This is my land."

376
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:53,999
"This is my land."

377
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:05,082
"A crow is calling on my terrace."

378
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:12,999
"A letter from my
beloved will arrive."

379
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:25,999
"And there'll surely
be a mention of me."

380
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,582
"When the wind moves like a comb
through the fields of wheat.."

381
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:46,749
"lt lifts a hundred
colourful scarves."

382
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:57,832
"When the water carriers come to
the well to fill their pots.."

383
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,332
"Someone entrances them with
the sweet sound of his flute."

384
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:09,749
"And so at every step.."

385
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,165
"And so at every step, a
new love story is born."

386
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:26,499
"This is my land."

387
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:47,999
"My Jugni is very choosy.
She favours the ones in love.

388
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:54,749
My dear this is what Jugni says.
She takes the name of Lord."

389
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,332
"You've made me happy, dear!"

390
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,999
"Where children, carried
upon their father's shoulders.."

391
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:18,082
"..are taken to see the fair.
And treated to comic shows."

392
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,415
"And ice-cream and snacks."

393
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,665
"And to candy and savouries."

394
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,415
"These innocent
children as dear as dolls."

395
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:49,749
"Are entertained by their
grandmothers with fairy tales."

396
00:40:49,833 --> 00:41:01,332
"This is my land."

397
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:11,999
"Hurry up, dear."

398
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:16,415
"A throne pricked
your beloved's feet."

399
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:21,999
"Dear, a throne
pricked your beloved's feet."

400
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,832
"Who will be the one to remove it?"

401
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:32,332
"Who will endure the
pain of your beloved?"

402
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:38,249
"Dear who will endure
the pain of your beloved?"

403
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,415
"ln my country, a
guest is revered as God."

404
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,999
"And no matter what
land he comes from..

405
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,915
..he becomes a part of this land."

406
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:19,332
"l have seen and
understood your country."

407
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:24,749
"l don't know why it
all seems familiar."

408
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:34,332
"These evenings are
familiar as are these mornings."

409
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:38,749
"Such is also my country.
Same as your land."

410
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:44,832
"Same as your land."

411
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:56,415
"This is my land,
same as your land."

412
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:02,415
"This is my land."

413
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,249
What are these people doing?

414
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,749
These are the last rites.

415
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,249
lt is done before the ashes
are immersed in the river.

416
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,999
So, why aren't we doing it?
- We aren't doing it because..

417
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,915
..you are a Muslim. And
this is a temple of the Sikhs.

418
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,999
And it's in our interest to
quietly immerse the ashes and..

419
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,415
..leave from here.

420
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:02,915
No, l want to immerse the
ashes with the complete rituals.

421
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:07,082
No, no, Zaara. lt's like this..
some priests are fanatics.

422
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,499
So, you'll get insulted and
l'll get beaten up unnecessarily.

423
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,999
Should l go and ask?
- No, no, you don't ask.

424
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:18,249
Wait here. l'll ask.
You sit right here.. please.

425
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,915
Dear God, it's all
in your blessings.

426
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:29,832
l'd told you about Kiritpur, right?
Just immerse me there.

427
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,915
l'll get refuge.

428
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:51,499
ls your name Zaara?

429
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,665
Yes.

430
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,415
You've come from Pakistan? Yes..

431
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,832
l've been in this
temple since 42 years.

432
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,582
But l have never seen
such devotion.

433
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:08,915
You've done more than
a real daughter would.

434
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,915
lt would be an honour for me to
do the last rites for your Bebe.

435
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,165
Come, dear, come with me. Come..

436
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:24,582
Dear God, it's all
in your blessings.

437
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,415
Come here, please.

438
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,082
Now what?

439
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,165
Put your hand out and
fulfil Bebe's last wish with me.

440
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,999
But how can l..

441
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,999
Look here, neither l, nor
you are Bebe's children. But..

442
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,165
lf it weren't for you l
wouldn't have been able to get..

443
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,665
..Bebe here so easily.

444
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,665
Like me, now, you too have
formed a bond with Bebe.

445
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:25,999
So, the right..

446
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,415
..to perform this final rite
is not just mine, but yours too.

447
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,082
Come.

448
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,999
Zaara, here's your bus ticket.
You'll reach Atari. And from there..

449
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,165
..catch a train straight to Lahore.
And here's your change.

450
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:10,999
Have you finished eating?

451
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,332
Anything else?
- No, thanks.

452
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,665
You've already done a lot for me.
l don't know how to thank you.

453
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:24,749
l'm very frank about
these things. lf you ask me.

454
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,832
l'll tell you what l really want.
- Tell me what l can do for you?

455
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:34,082
Be careful, l will ask, but
you will not be able to give it.

456
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:39,915
You don't know what you've done
for me. Ask for anything you want.

457
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,749
lt's a promise that l'll fulfil it.

458
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,999
You are making a promise
without knowing the price.

459
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,749
You might regret it.

460
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,665
A Pakistani has made a
promise to an lndian.

461
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,249
Now, my country's honour
is at stake.

462
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,582
Now, even if l want to,
l can't back off.

463
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,332
Please tell me what
can l do for you?

464
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,082
Give me this one day
from your life..

465
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,499
What?

466
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,082
You drew me close into your life.

467
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,374
You created a bond
between me and your Bebe.

468
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,832
You're leaving me with a
lifetime of sweet memories.

469
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:27,999
l want to share my world with you.
l too wish to give you memories..

470
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,915
..that stay with you for
the rest of your life.

471
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,082
l know a day is very precious
to you. But l promise that..

472
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:44,165
..you'll never forget this day.

473
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:55,499
l warned you that you'd
regret making this promise.

474
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,249
So, you fell in love with her?

475
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,665
What l felt..

476
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:27,499
l still can't understand.

477
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:34,915
Why l asked her for a day, l
don't know.. l just asked her.

478
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:39,999
But yes, at that time, l did
feel that our acquaintance..

479
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:44,165
..was not destined to
end right here.

480
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,915
We hadn't met just to
come till here.

481
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,999
Our relationship was
still incomplete.

482
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:58,665
There was still
something more to happen.

483
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:06,415
With this thought, the
words blurted out of my mouth..

484
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,582
..and that poor girl
listened to me silently.

485
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,082
Did she come with you?

486
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,332
Saamiya, the honour of
your Pakistan was at stake.

487
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:28,915
How could she not come?

488
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,165
Why have you made that
strange face?

489
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,999
Your mother scolded
you on the phone?

490
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,832
l'm scared of heights.
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

491
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,332
You said this is a shorter route.

492
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,082
The other way would
take half a day more..

493
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,082
So, what could l do?
- Does that mean..

494
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,915
..you'll wear this scary
expression for the entire journey?

495
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,582
Please smile a little,
or l'll get scared too.

496
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,249
Okay, listen, eat some nuts.
lt'll take your mind off this.

497
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,832
Hold out your hand..
- No..

498
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,332
Okay, open your mouth.

499
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:18,915
More?

500
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:45,999
Brother Veer has come. And
there's a girl with him.

501
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,999
Hey, Pappu's mother,
look, our Veer has come.

502
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,665
And he has brought
his fiancee with him.

503
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,832
Oh, a girl won't come just
like that with her fiance.

504
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,999
Veeru must have married her,
she must be his wife.

505
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,582
Maati.. Maati..

506
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,665
Maati.

507
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,415
Maati.. Maati..

508
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,915
Oh, what happened? Who died now?

509
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,999
Maati, Veeru's here.

510
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,665
Veeru?
- Yes

511
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,332
And he's got his wife along
with him. - What rubbish!

512
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,082
My Veeru will never get
married without informing me.

513
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:29,665
l'm telling the truth, Maati.

514
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:32,082
The whole village has
come out to see them..

515
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:39,999
What the hell! Let him come.
l'm not going to talk to him.

516
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:46,999
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh, where the
hell are you? Where's he gone now?

517
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,915
Come on.

518
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,915
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh.

519
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:16,832
Father, Maati's calling you.
- Yes, right. l heard her..

520
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,749
She always calls me
at the wrong time.

521
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,749
Come here, son. l'll
tell you something.

522
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,999
Don't ever make the mistake of
getting married. lf you do..

523
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,165
..you won't be able to score a goal..

524
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,249
..for the rest of your life. - All
right, sir. - Chaudhary Sumer Singh.

525
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,415
l'm coming.

526
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,999
Oh, my dear one, how many
times do l have to tell you..

527
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:36,165
..not to disturb me during a game.
- And how many times do l tell you..

528
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,332
..if you want to die then lie
down on a bed and die. Don't play..

529
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,499
..with kids old enough
to be your grandchildren..

530
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,582
..and get your bones broken.

531
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,999
Let me tell you one thing.
ln this entire village..

532
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,832
..there's not a single player
who can compete with Sumer Singh.

533
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,749
Except your son, look
what he's been up to.

534
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:57,582
Veeru's come? Where?
- But not alone. He's got married.

535
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:00,082
What are you saying?
- Look there.

536
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,832
Hello, Uncle.

537
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:10,082
Hey, listen. Go there.

538
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,999
How're you, Kamli?
- Fine.

539
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:20,165
l'll say hi to father.
Your blessings, father.

540
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,999
You idiot! Without asking or
telling us, you got married?

541
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:25,999
l'll thrash you.
- Married? Who told you that?

542
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,165
Then who's she? My wife?
- No, no.

543
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,915
Your wife is right here.
- l'll hit you.

544
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,415
Then who's she?
- You're too much, Maati.

545
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:33,999
ls there only one kind
of relationship between..

546
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,415
..a man and a woman?

547
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,165
Bless me.

548
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,999
She's our guest, Father. After
saving her in a rescue operation..

549
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,415
..l got her here to show her our
village and to make her meet you.

550
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,582
You're making
mountain out of a molehill.

551
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:52,999
Of course. l
understood the moment l saw her.

552
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:56,582
Such a beautiful girl with a
fool like you.. impossible.

553
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:01,082
What's your name, dear?
- Zaara, sir. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

554
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,915
What a lovely name.
Where are you from, dear?

555
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,540
From Pakistan.

556
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,999
Oh, wow, that's fantastic.

557
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:11,165
Then you're our
extra-special guest. Look..

558
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,915
We've served the
people of our country a lot.

559
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,207
But this is our first
chance to be hospitable..

560
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,832
..to our neighbouring country.

561
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,290
What would you like to eat?
Should l get some butter milk?

562
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,832
Some milk, some..
- Oh, enough.

563
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:22,999
Come with me.

564
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,999
lf you get caught up in his chatter,
it'll be nightfall soon.

565
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,832
Move aside.
- Okay, never mind me.

566
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,082
Make way.
- Oh, yes

567
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,832
Veeru, where're you going?
Wait a minute.

568
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,165
All of you get going.

569
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,999
Yes, one minute..
- What?

570
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:44,082
Yes?
- Well, have you got my things?

571
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,999
Yes. Here's your bottle of rum.

572
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,707
Don't drink it all alone. - No way.

573
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:53,582
lf Maati catches you this time
around, l'm not going to lie to her.

574
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:58,665
Just once more.. one last time..
- Okay, last time.

575
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,499
Now, go. Go.

576
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,457
Cheers to the neighbouring country.

577
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,249
Come, l'll do that.
- No, l'll manage.

578
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,749
The way you're
making it, it's evident.

579
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,415
Someone else ties your hair at home.

580
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:29,332
Come, l'll make it for you.
Just feel at home. Come.

581
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,415
This is Veer's room, right? - Yes

582
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:39,665
Whenever he'd get a medal or
a photo, l'd hang it up here.

583
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,999
And when he's not at home,
then his father and l..

584
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:49,165
..warm our eyes looking at them.
- There's a lot of love..

585
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,332
..between the three of you.
- Because there's no one else..

586
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,249
..to share our love with.

587
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,415
His mother and father passed
away when he was really small.

588
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,165
Since then we're the
only ones for him.

589
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,082
We're actually his aunt
and uncle.

590
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,832
But he calls us his
father and mother.

591
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,165
We don't have any
children of our own.

592
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:18,415
So, it's just the three of us.
Look, your plait is ready.

593
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:25,332
Hey. l look just like all of you.
- This is nothing.

594
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,332
You'll look like a true Punjabi
girl tonight. lt's Lodi tonight.

595
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,082
And here, we celebrate
it with a lot of pomp.

596
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:35,832
l'll take out the dress l
wore for my first Lodi for you.

597
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:39,749
No, Maati, l'll wear my own clothes.
- You call me mother..

598
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,165
..and at the same time
argue with me?

599
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,415
Look, you've come to
our house just for a day.

600
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:47,082
For this one day at
least become one of us.

601
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:06,499
"Oh traveller, you've two
yellow and two red flowers."

602
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,582
Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

603
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:10,665
Like l was telling you.
When l was young..

604
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,832
..l would take Maati on a cycle
like this right till Amritsar.

605
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:18,582
Now, she's so become so fat
that she doesn't fit on a cycle.

606
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,499
No, Father, she's not fat at all.
- Oh, you don't know. l know.

607
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,999
Veer was telling me that Maati and..

608
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,582
..you have built this
village on your own. - Yes.

609
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:31,415
That's right. At first,
there were just fields here.

610
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,082
Then after writing many letters,
we arranged for electricity.

611
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,915
Do you see that hospital?
- Yes.

612
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,999
That was a cow shed earlier.
How are you, Doctor?

613
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,165
Doing fine, sir.
- Very well, friend.

614
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,082
And look, the children's school.

615
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,499
Maati and l were the
first teachers here.

616
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,582
No one knew how to read or write.

617
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,999
Now, the kids study
here till eighth grade.

618
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:58,165
After that, the boys are sent off
to Kartarpur, for further studies.

619
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:00,999
And what about the girls?
- lt's not possible for us..

620
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:05,165
..to send the girls so far.
And anyway, they have to learn to..

621
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,832
..look after the household. So, what
use is higher education for them?

622
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,332
That's not fair, Father.

623
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,999
Not fair? What do you mean by that?

624
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,082
l hope you don't mind this, Father.

625
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,249
What you and Maati have
done for this village..

626
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:22,499
..would've have taken
people centuries to achieve.

627
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,999
But while you made the men
capable of facing the world..

628
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:29,082
..you disabled the women.

629
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,999
That's why a Veer has
become an Air Force Pilot..

630
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,165
..and the girls of the village
remain illiterate and unpolished.

631
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,165
Girls today haνe reached the moon.

632
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:43,165
They walk
shoulder-to-shoulder with men.

633
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,665
With education, perhaps, a girl from
this village could've outdone Veer.

634
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,582
Don't you think so, Father?

635
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:55,915
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh.
Where are you loitering?

636
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,082
Oh! Whenever l'm doing
something really important..

637
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:01,915
..she comes and troubles me.
Yes, madam. Now what?

638
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,499
lt's time to light the Lodi.
Come and get ready.

639
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:07,749
All right, l'm coming.

640
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,499
Come, dear. Let's light the Lodi.

641
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,999
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

642
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,582
"Who will save you poor one?"

643
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:23,749
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

644
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,999
"The Dullah married off
his daughter."

645
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,207
"He gave a measure of sugar!"

646
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,665
"The girl's shawl is torn."

647
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,790
"Who will stitch her shawl?"

648
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:34,999
"The landlords ravished her."

649
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,999
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

650
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:39,332
"Who will save you poor one?"

651
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,499
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

652
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:43,707
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

653
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:45,832
"Who will save you poor one?"

654
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,999
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

655
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,165
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

656
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,499
"Who will save you poor one?"

657
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:56,665
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you.
Who will save you poor one?"

658
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,999
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you.

659
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:01,082
Who will save you poor one?
Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

660
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,832
Listen everybody.

661
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,665
Come here. Come on.

662
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,082
Coming, Father.

663
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,249
Let's go there.. Coming.

664
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,915
Everyone, listen to
what l have to say.

665
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,665
The cricket pitch that was going to
be made here.. will not happen now.

666
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,832
Why?
- Why, Father?

667
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:26,749
Relax, l'm telling you. Because now
we're building a girls high school.

668
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,832
The girls are glad.

669
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,999
l promise you that once
this school is built..

670
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:38,915
..the girls won't have to leave
the village for higher studies.

671
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,999
And one more thing, the
first brick for the school..

672
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:49,165
..isn't going to be laid by Maati or
me, but will be laid by the girl..

673
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,499
..because of whom this school is
being built. Ms. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

674
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:07,665
Come, dear.

675
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,499
Father, how can l..
- Why not?

676
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:17,082
Being so young, you've
taught me such a big lesson..

677
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,082
Then why can't you do
this little thing for me?

678
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,832
Come, dear, come.

679
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,082
Oh, Kamli.

680
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,499
l, Ginda Singh. l really like you.

681
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,999
Oh. l, Darshan Singh Aulakh..

682
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,832
Will die for you.

683
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:31,082
Maati, is this the custom of Lodi?
- No, this is Veer's father's custom.

684
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:38,082
What do you mean?
- ln our time, romance was taboo.

685
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:41,665
On top of that, l was from
Madras and he, from Punjab,

686
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:46,249
So, one night, during Lodi, he asked
for my hand in front of everybody.

687
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:50,249
My parents didn't know what
to say. And we got married.

688
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,999
After that, eνer since we've come
here and started celebrating Lodi..

689
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:58,165
..he's started this custom that
if a boy is in love with a girl..

690
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,832
..he confesses his
love in front of everyone.

691
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,999
lf the girl wants to refuse..

692
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,582
..she quietly throws a
fistful of sesame into the fire.

693
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:06,999
lf she wants to accept, she
calls out the boy's name..

694
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,332
..and breaks sugar cane.

695
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,665
Then after that we get them married.

696
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,999
Wow, this is such a
lovely custom. That means..

697
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:19,082
..when the bride and the groom agree,
what's the need of a priest.

698
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,415
Hey, Saraswati Kaur.

699
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:29,999
My lady from Madras. l,
Chaudhary Sumer Singh..

700
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,999
..ask for your hand in marriage
for the next seven lifetimes.

701
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:42,707
l've done it.

702
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,082
Come on, girl.

703
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,832
l'll set him right.

704
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,999
Let that be. Come on. Come on.

705
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,165
What.. my proposal.. Rejected?

706
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:12,082
Maati, what're you doing?
Father doesn't stand a chance?

707
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,999
Tell him if he wants to
spend seven lifetimes with me..

708
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,082
..he has to fulfil
certain promises. ls he ready?

709
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,499
Promises? What promises, Maati?

710
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,165
Sorry, Father. that's it. Now,
drop the sugar cane.

711
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,165
Okay, l'll drop it.

712
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:40,332


713
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,082
"l would sacrifice my life for you
if only l could know what you want."

714
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,249
"l would agree to everything,
my beautiful one."

715
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:54,749
"l would sacrifice my life for you
if only l could know what you want."

716
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:58,749
"l would agree to everything,
my beautiful one."

717
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,999
"l would sacrifice
my life for you."

718
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:06,999
"l know you very, νery well."

719
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:11,999
"lf you want to be with me then,
you better fulfil what l ask of you."

720
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:16,749
"l know you very, νery well."

721
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:21,749
"lf you want to be with me then, you
better fulfil what l ask of you."

722
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:27,582
"l know you very, νery well."

723
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:30,082
"Hey, you are my life."

724
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,832
"You are my beloved."

725
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,749
"The festival of Lodi is here?"

726
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,165
"Take your partners?"

727
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,582
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved."

728
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,999
"And never let it go."

729
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,457
"Never let it go."

730
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,832
"Don't tell lies."

731
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:53,249
"Don't be guilty of blasphemy?"

732
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:57,749
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you."

733
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,832
"Been broken by you"

734
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,999
"As soon as the sun
sets every evening..

735
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:07,749
..you drink with your cronies."

736
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:12,582
"The sun goes down and you get drunk.
What sort of life is this?"

737
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:20,999
"You're perfectly right and
henceforth l shall keep it in mind."

738
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:25,832
"Just let me drink today, from
tomorrow, l shall not touch a drop."

739
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:31,999
"Yes, now, he will come
straight home at sundown."

740
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:36,207
"l would sacrifice my life for you."

741
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:40,999
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved."

742
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:45,915
"My life, oh, dear one.
Oh, beautiful one."

743
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,082
"Everyday, l see you playing cards.
More beloved than me.."

744
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:09,665
"..are your fives,
sixes and sevens?"

745
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,832
"Why?"

746
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:18,082
"My card playing
foolishness will end forever."

747
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:23,082
"Now, there will be only two cards
in my life, the king and the queen."

748
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:28,915
"My life will be yours if you
give up these decks of cards."

749
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:34,707
"l know you very, νery well."

750
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,415
"Hey, you are my life."

751
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,082
"You are my beloved."

752
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,999
"The festival of Lodi is here?

753
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,415
"Take your partners?"

754
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,832
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved."

755
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:53,165
"And never let it go?"

756
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,749
"Never let it go"

757
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,082
"Don't tell lies?"

758
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:00,499
"Don't be guilty of blasphemy?"

759
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:04,999
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you."

760
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:08,082
"Been broken by you."

761
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,082
"Whenever l ask you to bring
something, you can never remember."

762
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:27,165
"l asked you for some ribbons
for my hair and you bought sweets."

763
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,499
"Now, l have this notebook
in which l will write.."

764
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:40,415
"..so that l can bring
exactly what you ask me to get."

765
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:46,415
"Yes, slowly, he will mend
his ways completely.. yes?"

766
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,624
"l would sacrifice my life for you."

767
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:55,415
"My beautiful one, my
innocent one, my life, my beloved."

768
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:00,832
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved."

769
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,665
"Whether you change or you don't,
you will always be mine."

770
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:21,749
"l want that in every
birth you should be mine."

771
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,749
"Beloved, in every birth,
l'm your worshipper."

772
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:38,832
"You were mine, you are mine
and you will always be mine."

773
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:44,582
"Yes, without you, he will be lost."

774
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:50,915
"l would sacrifice my life for you."

775
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,999
"lt's the season of Lodi."

776
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,999
"Make pairings."

777
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:17,082
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved,
and never let it go."

778
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,165
"Do not lie."

779
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,249
"Don't be guilty of blasphemy."

780
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:25,665
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you."

781
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,832
Father. Here you are, Father.

782
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,082
God knows where all
Maati's sent me to look for you.

783
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,665
Breakfast is getting cold. Come
quickly. l've got to leave. Come on.

784
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,415
Come here son. Sit.

785
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:58,749
What happened, Father?
What're you looking at?

786
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,332
l'm looking at my lifetime's
achievements, my legacy, my village.

787
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:11,999
Until now, l was very proud of
myself that l have done great work.

788
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:15,165
That l've developed
this village from nothing.

789
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,999
But yesterday..

790
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:23,165
..that young girl asked me an
innocent question. And l realised..

791
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:28,832
..that l haven't done much..
there's still a lot left to do.

792
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:34,749
Son, in the few years left of my
life, how much can l really achieve?

793
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,499
And after l die, this
village will be orphaned.

794
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,749
All the work will be
left incomplete.

795
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,999
So, l was seeing a
dream and wondering..

796
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:50,582
..if my dream will come true or not.
- What dream, Father?

797
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,415
l saw that after Maati and l are
gone, you are here riding my bicycle.

798
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,915
Your wife is sitting behind you.
The village is not orphaned.

799
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,415
Nothing is left incomplete.
That's what l was seeing.

800
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:09,832
So, why won't this dream come true?

801
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,082
Now that you've become
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh..

802
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,665
..you'll settle in the city. Why
would you worry about the village?

803
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,165
No, Father. l am your
Veeru first and foremost.

804
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,749
And if you've seen a
dream it will come true.

805
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,749
Only l won't be
circling around on a cycle.

806
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:30,999
l'll use a helicopter. Will
that do? Okay, come on now..

807
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:35,082
Otherwise Maati's going to shout.
- Oh, there's one more thing.

808
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:46,165
ln my dream, l've also seen the girl
sitting behind you on the cycle.

809
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,499
Looks like you'νe already
had some rum this morning.

810
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,499
Father she's a Pakistani

811
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:04,082
She's Pakistani,
Chinese or Japanese.

812
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,082
l don't care. l can just see..

813
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:14,249
..that when this girl sits
behind you on the cycle..

814
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:19,415
..her hand will rest on your
shoulder, she'll never let you fall.

815
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:26,582
She'll never let you take a
wrong turn. Come here, sit. Listen..

816
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:32,749
When the right woman
comes into a man's life..

817
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,415
..that's when his
life becomes complete.

818
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,999
l Chaudhary Sumer
Singh am incomplete..

819
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:45,165
..without your Maati. And you
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh..

820
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,249
..will be incomplete without Zaara.

821
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:50,999
That's why, first, you understand..

822
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,665
..what your heart is telling you,
and then quickly tell her.

823
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,332
Otherwise, son, it'll be too late.

824
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,582
Father, tell me one thing.
- Yes?

825
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,082
Since it's your dream, is
it okay if the wife sits..

826
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:08,415
..on the front seat of the cycle?

827
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,165
Yes, it's okay.
Should l go tell her?

828
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,999
No, please. Only l will tell her.
- No, no l'll tell her.

829
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:16,415
No, l do the talking.
- She's downstairs? l'll tell her.

830
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,374
Who's marrying? You or l?
- One and the same.

831
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:24,582
One and the same?
- Neνer mind. Hey, lucky girl.

832
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:36,415
May l leave, Maati?
- Oh, are you leaving?

833
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:38,999
l'll let you go only
on one condition.

834
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,415
You have to promise to come back.

835
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:43,999
Okay, l promise.

836
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:48,165
But in return, will you give
me permission for something?

837
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,415
What?

838
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:51,999
Now onwards..

839
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:54,332
..may l call you Bebe?

840
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,915
l think we should leave.

841
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:18,082
Or it'll get late.
- l'm ready. l'll go get my bag.

842
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,082
You're leaving?
- Yes, Maati.

843
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:27,582
You'd asked me to come here for
Lodi no matter what. So, l came.

844
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:30,207
But l've got leave for only two days.

845
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,082
l've to report at
headquarters tonight

846
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:35,665
l'll put Zaara on a bus to
Amritsar and.. - Absolutely not.

847
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,999
You'll take Zaara to Atari and see
her onto her train. She's all alone.

848
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,082
What if something happens to her?

849
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,915
She's become your favourite
in a day?

850
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,332
You would get upset when it was
time for me to leave, and stop me.

851
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,165
Today, you want me
to leave quickly?

852
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,915
l don't have time
for your nonsense.

853
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:57,999
l've made some sweets for
you and Ranjit. Take them

854
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,415
Oh, Ginda, where've you been?
- Veeru's getting late.

855
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,999
Father, l was filling up diesel.
- ls this any time to fill up?

856
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,332
Let it be.

857
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,582
Okay, now, bless me.

858
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:16,499
May you live long, son.

859
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,665
Tell her, okay?
- Yes, yes, l'll tell her.

860
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,832
Shall l?
- Stop pressurising me.

861
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:22,999
Maati, control him.

862
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,582
Oh, where are you going?
What's in this?

863
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,332
Not for you.
- No? l see.

864
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:29,915
For your son?
- Father.

865
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:35,999
What are you doing? Here,
girls don't touch the feet.

866
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:37,540
But daughters ask for blessings..

867
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,582
..before they bid
farewell to their fathers.

868
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:44,082
May you live long, my dear.

869
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:51,082
Give your parents
a message from me.

870
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,249
Okay.

871
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,999
Tell them that
a 60-year-old lndian..

872
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,665
..salutes the values
they've put into you.

873
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,249
Will we reach in an hour?
- lt will take about half hour.

874
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,832
Look after yourselves.

875
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:38,665
Goodbye.

876
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,082
What do you think?
Will Veeru tell her?

877
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:52,165
He's Chaudhary Sumer Singh's son,
why won't he tell her?

878
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,832
Didn't l tell you?

879
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:58,999
Stop it.
- What.. where're you going? Listen..

880
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:11,582
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
thank you very much.

881
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,082
What for?

882
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,999
ln exchange for my one day..

883
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:21,082
..you've given me a lifetime
of memories and relationships.

884
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:25,999
lt was a promise from an lndian to a
Pakistani. lf l didn't fulfil it..

885
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:29,499
..my country's honour
would've been tarnished, right?

886
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:35,082
l think getting Bebe's ashes
here was God's way to get me here.

887
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,665
l was destined to meet all of you.
- Do you believe in destiny?

888
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,832
Of course.

889
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:47,082
Don't you?
- Not until now.

890
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,665
But now, l've begun to believe.

891
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,499
Are you all right?

892
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:04,582
lt's all right now. Come on.

893
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,249
Oh..

894
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,415
You aren't all right,
you're hurting?

895
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,165
Look, let's rest here for a while..
- No, l'll miss my train

896
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:19,665
You won't miss your train.

897
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:24,915
Lean on me. Put your hand across.

898
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:28,915
Your anklet.

899
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:33,999
l'll keep it. l'll
give it to you later.

900
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,457
Come, hold on tight.

901
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,915
How many times are you
going to save my life?

902
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,415
As many times you
put yourself at risk.

903
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,499
Actually, there's a
lot of hustle for seats.

904
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,374
The festival of Eid is coming up.

905
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,082
At this time, a lot of
people go across the border.

906
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,832
But don't worry, l'll find a way.

907
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:47,999
'The passengers are requested to..'

908
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:15,749
Thank God you're all right. l
just got off the train from Lahore.

909
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,082
l was finding out about
Kiritpur when l saw you.

910
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:23,999
Your father has returned.
He sent me.

911
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,582
Let's call home and
tell them you're fine.

912
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,165
Then we'll prepare for our return.

913
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:33,999
And you are..

914
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:37,915
This is Veer. Squadron
Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

915
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:40,249
Thanks to him, l'νe
managed to get here.

916
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:44,082
This is Raza. Raza Shirazi,
my fiance.

917
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,999
'Passengers going to
Lahore are requested to..

918
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:14,999
..before taking their
seats in the train.'

919
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:18,582
'We wish you a happy journey.
Thank you.'

920
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,582
The seats are done, we
should be leaving now.

921
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,999
So silly of me. l kept
talking about eνerything..

922
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:32,999
..but l forgot to tell you about
Raza. - You made a big mistake.

923
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,832
What?

924
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,082
You made a big mistake.

925
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:50,915
Zaara, l'm a very simple man.

926
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,915
l speak frankly and
understand things simply.

927
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,999
lt's the first time
l started thinking..

928
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,499
..differently because
of father and Maati.

929
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,082
The entire journey l kept thinking..

930
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:07,249
..up a way to stop you,
not to let you go..

931
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:12,415
..and tell you that l really like
you and if you think l'm okay then..

932
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:18,415
..let's get married.

933
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:22,999
And we'll breeze through
life together just like..

934
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,999
..these past two days.

935
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,665
But the guy up there
has strange ways.

936
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:32,999
He kept building my confidence
and then when we got here..

937
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,499
He changed the entire story.

938
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:48,249
You must be wondering why l'm
telling you all this right now.

939
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,915
Please don't get me wrong.

940
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,082
l understand that you
belong to someone else..

941
01:24:57,166 --> 01:25:04,249
..and there's nothing
between us, nor can there ever be.

942
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:11,415
But wherever
whenever you need a friend..

943
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,582
..just remember that there
is a man across the border..

944
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:19,832
..who will give his life for you.

945
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:29,582
Zaara, we must leave.

946
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:31,999
Mr. Veer.

947
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:36,082
Zaara told me how you
saved her life.

948
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,165
Now, l'm indebted to you.

949
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:41,999
So, tell me how may l repay you?
- Just keep Zaara happy.

950
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:46,165
The debt will be repaid.

951
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,999
Careful, Mr Veer..

952
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:52,749
..lest l get the impression that
you've fallen in love with Zaara.

953
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:58,665
What is love..
l don't know. But yes.

954
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:02,999
l do wish from the
bottom of my heart..

955
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:06,165
..that Zaara never
has tears in her eyes.

956
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:08,415
That she always keeps smiling.

957
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,582
lf that's what you call loνe,
then love it is.

958
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:23,832
Mr. Veer, you're talking
about my fiancee to my face.

959
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:30,665
l don't know whether to consider
this a compliment or an insult.

960
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:36,499
lf you think of this as nothing,
it's better. For the truth is that..

961
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:42,915
..l'm nothing to her and
you are everything for her.

962
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,082
Goodbye.

963
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,415
Let's go.

964
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:14,040


965
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,082
"Just for two moments, the
caravans of our dreams made a stop."

966
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:36,749
"And then, you went
your way and l went mine."

967
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:42,665
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

968
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:55,082
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

969
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:19,582
"Was that really you or
was it a luminous sunbeam?"

970
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:25,999
"Was that you or was
it a blossoming bud?"

971
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:31,165
"Was that you or was that
the monsoon of my dreams?"

972
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:36,915
"Was that you or was
that a cloud of happiness?"

973
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:42,499
"Was that you or was it
a full blooming flower?"

974
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:48,832
"Was that you or did l
find a beautiful new world?"

975
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:53,915
"Just for two moments, the
caravans of our dreams made a stop."

976
01:28:54,083 --> 01:29:00,082
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

977
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:05,415
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

978
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:12,832
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

979
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:24,749
786.

980
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,082
Dinner time.

981
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:36,582
And ma'am, your visiting
time is over.

982
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,582
You'll have to leave now.

983
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,082
l'll come back tomorrow.

984
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:55,915
Sorry, your story is
left incomplete.

985
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:57,707
Come on, ma'am.

986
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,999
And 786..

987
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,999
..l'm sending someone to
take the plate in ten minutes.

988
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:17,499
Eat quickly, or you'll have to
sleep on an empty stomach again.

989
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:24,999
Have you ever wondered
why his number is 786?

990
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:26,415
What?

991
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:32,999
Have you ever wondered.. From
the thousands of prisoners here..

992
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:39,082
..how come this lone Hindu prisoner
has got Allah's holy number?

993
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,999
This is not a mere coincidence,
this is God's great miracle.

994
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:54,665
His way of telling all of
you that this is God's own man.

995
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,082
Treat him with respect.

996
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:01,999
Next time, you speak
to him so rudely..

997
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:04,665
..give a serious thought
to what l've just said.

998
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:13,624
These are sweets.
My mother sent them for you.

999
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:20,374
Please have some. She has
sent them with her blessings.

1000
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:34,707
What happened? You don't like it?

1001
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:44,457
No.. no.. these are just
like the ones Maati would make.

1002
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:50,290
Things made by a mother's
hands are the same everywhere.

1003
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:54,707
May l have one more?

1004
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:57,374
Yes, please. These are all for you.

1005
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:05,207
Tell your mother she's
filled my entire childhood..

1006
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:09,124
..into this little box.

1007
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:11,707
Delicious.

1008
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:17,540
All night, l was
telling my mother your story.

1009
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,124
My mother cried a
little and went to sleep.

1010
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:24,124
But l stayed up waiting for dawn.

1011
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:29,457
l kept thinking how
and why did you get here?

1012
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:35,124
Kept wondering why didn't
this story end at that station?

1013
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:42,457
This story couldn't
haνe ended there.

1014
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:49,790
Because so far, this was
only a tale of Veer's love.

1015
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:55,624
Zaara's love had not yet begun.

1016
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:05,207
And without knowing what Zaara felt,
Veer's story and Veer's life..

1017
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:12,207
..would both remain incomplete.

1018
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:21,790
Jehangir Hayaat Khan, Zaara's
father and the pride of Lahore.

1019
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:29,290
Since the inception of Pakistan
the name of the Hayaat Khan family..

1020
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:34,290
..was synonymous with respect,
power and glory.

1021
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:42,124
Jehangir Hayaat Khan was taking
his first step into politics..

1022
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:46,457
..with the help of Abdul Shirazi.

1023
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:52,207
Another rich,
respectable man of Lahore.

1024
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:55,540
He was Raza Shirazi's father.

1025
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,207
Zaara and Raza's marriage
was no ordinary relationship.

1026
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:06,707
All these people's futures
were dependent on this alliance.

1027
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:09,207
ln this situation..

1028
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:12,207
Zaara's coming to lndia all
by herself was..

1029
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,707
..a νery irresponsible act.

1030
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:19,957
And to forgive such an act was
not Jehangir Hayaat Khan's nature.

1031
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:25,207
lt was a month since
Zaara had returned..

1032
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:28,207
..but her father had
not yet spoken with her.

1033
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,207
Oh, God. Ma'am, l'll burst with
happiness what an elegant outfit..

1034
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:37,374
..and look. l think this
jewellery set is an antique.

1035
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:39,290
l think it belongs to
Mr. Raza's ancestors.

1036
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:46,124
Our Zaara is very lucky. Mr Raza has
everything. Respectability, money.

1037
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:50,707
There's no doubt in that.
He has everything by God's grace.

1038
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:54,290
There could not be a better
match than this. Just pray for them.

1039
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:58,957
"There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you."

1040
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:05,040
Mother, can you give
up your life for papa?

1041
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:10,040
Of course. He's my husband.
l can do anything for him

1042
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:13,290
And would papa give
up his life for you?

1043
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:16,207
What kind of a question
is that. Pray to God..

1044
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:17,874
..that such an
occasion does not arise.

1045
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:21,707
But if such an occasion
were to arise?

1046
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:26,540
Then can you say for sure that
papa would give up his life for you?

1047
01:36:26,916 --> 01:36:28,124
Have you gone mad?

1048
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:31,457
Shabbo, give me some lime.
My hands have become sticky.

1049
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:35,624
That means you're not sure?

1050
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:44,207
Listen, baby, between
a woman's love..

1051
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:47,374
..and a man's love,
there's a huge difference.

1052
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:54,540
A woman loves with
all her heart and soul.

1053
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:58,624
Men do not have the
strength to love like that.

1054
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:03,707
l know why you're
asking me this question.

1055
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:07,290
But don't expect this from Raza.

1056
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:13,707
Just give him your heart and
soul and fulfil your duties.

1057
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:18,374
And l am very sure, that he
will fulfil his duties too.

1058
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,874
But he won't giνe up his
life for me, isn't it?

1059
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:25,124
You're talking nonsense.

1060
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:28,207
Here, Shabbo, you put it. This
girl is going to drive me mad.

1061
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:32,790
"There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you."

1062
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:40,290
But l know someone who will
willingly give up his life for me.

1063
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:51,207
A person whose eyes are honest
and whose words have honour.

1064
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:57,207
A man who can forsake
everything for a woman's love.

1065
01:37:57,291 --> 01:38:04,207
A person to whom it
makes no difference that..

1066
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:10,374
..l'm a Pakistani and
he's an lndian.

1067
01:38:13,791 --> 01:38:17,624
Who're you talking about?
What've you been up to?

1068
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:20,124
Tell me the truth. Swear on me.

1069
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:23,207
He hasn't even touched me, Mother.

1070
01:38:23,291 --> 01:38:27,124
But l have lost my
heart and soul to him.

1071
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:33,124
Don't you know your father?
Till now, he's not talking to you.

1072
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:37,624
lf he finds out about this,
he'll kill you. Don't you realise?

1073
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:40,874
You're getting engaged today.
You're going to be married soon.

1074
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:44,124
Now, it's wrong to think
of anything else, Zaara.

1075
01:38:45,208 --> 01:38:51,540
Oh, stupid girl, love is only found
in books, and poetry. Not in life.

1076
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:58,374
That's what l thought
until now.. until now..

1077
01:38:58,708 --> 01:38:59,790
'Listen.'

1078
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:04,207
Shabbo, please put
some sense into her.

1079
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,624
Otherwise a storm will
hit this house.

1080
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:14,457
Just understand one thing,
Zaara. Your future is with Raza.

1081
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:18,790
Now, neither you can
change this, nor God.

1082
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:23,290
What's all this, Zaara?

1083
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:27,124
lt's love, Shabbo.

1084
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,957
lt doesn't come with reason.

1085
01:39:31,625 --> 01:39:35,707


1086
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:43,124
"Pearl millet. We
crushed it in our palms."

1087
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:45,457
"Pearl millet."

1088
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:52,707
We crushed pearl millet in our
palms. My beloved is angry."

1089
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:57,707
"My beloved is angry.
l sent him away."

1090
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:00,207
"Pearl millet."

1091
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:09,707
"The day that l will
forget you will never come."

1092
01:40:09,916 --> 01:40:15,790
"You had fallen for my beauty."

1093
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,207
When he used to look into my eyes.

1094
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:18,374
Wow. - He used to show
a lot of respect."

1095
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:19,540
"Wow!"

1096
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:23,540
Sit.

1097
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:36,124
Since you're my only child,
l've given you a lot of freedom.

1098
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:41,624
You've been brought up more
like a son than a daughter.

1099
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:46,957
Normally, a mother explains
a daughter's duties to her.

1100
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:54,540
But since l think of you as my son,
l shall myself do the honours.

1101
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:01,207
You're aware..

1102
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:03,207
..that your
grandfather was one of the..

1103
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:04,457
..most respected
politicians of Pakistan.

1104
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:08,207
But he died just a few
days before he could reach..

1105
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:09,624
..the pinnacle of his success.

1106
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,207
Ever since..

1107
01:41:13,291 --> 01:41:19,207
..being his successor,
l've been trying to..

1108
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:21,957
..get his party to that same level.

1109
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:29,207
l've been unsuccessful so far.
But now thanks to Raza's father..

1110
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:32,124
..success seems near.

1111
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,207
ln a few days, you'll be
going to their house..

1112
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:37,790
..taking my honour with you.

1113
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:44,207
lt's your duty to understand
the sensitiνity of this bond.

1114
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:48,207
To spread happiness
in good times and bad.

1115
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:55,874
To strengthen the bonds
of every relationship.

1116
01:41:57,125 --> 01:42:01,290
And no matter what, safeguard
their honour as well as ours.

1117
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:07,624
Any small mistake on your
part can destroy everything.

1118
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:13,207
l hope you understand
what l'm saying.

1119
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,582
Yes.

1120
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:18,040
Do you have anything to say?

1121
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:25,290
Then would you please come here?

1122
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:34,874
lt's been a long time since l've
seen the dimples of your cheeks.

1123
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:39,624
l hope you haven't left
them in lndia.

1124
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:44,040
That's my girl.

1125
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:55,957


1126
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:59,957
"Dearest behold.."

1127
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:04,874
"The distances have gone."

1128
01:43:07,125 --> 01:43:19,124
"l am here, here, here and here."

1129
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:54,290
"Dearest behold.
The distances have gone."

1130
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:59,874
"l am here, here, here and here."

1131
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:05,540
"Dearest behold.
The distances have gone."

1132
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:11,040
"l am here, here, here and here."

1133
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:16,790
"Beyond all borders and
encumbrances."

1134
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:23,124
"l am here, here, here and here."

1135
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:52,874
"l am the secret you
can never hide."

1136
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:58,790
"l am the gesture
you can never forget."

1137
01:45:04,208 --> 01:45:09,874
"Why are you surprised
at these vibrations?"

1138
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:15,124
"Because l am the
sound of your heart."

1139
01:45:15,541 --> 01:45:20,790
"Listen, if you can to
the rhythms of your heart."

1140
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:26,374
"l'm here, here, here and here."

1141
01:45:26,708 --> 01:45:32,124
"Beyond all borders
and encumbrances."

1142
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:38,207
"l am here, here, here and here."

1143
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:19,290
"l and only l am now
in your thoughts."

1144
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:25,207
"l am in all your
questions and your answers."

1145
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:36,124
"l occupy all our dreams."

1146
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:41,707
"l am in the radiance
of your sight."

1147
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:47,457
"You can see me
wherever your vision goes."

1148
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:53,040
"l'm here, here, here and here."

1149
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:55,790
"Dearest behold.."

1150
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:58,624
"The distances have gone."

1151
01:46:58,791 --> 01:47:04,124
"l am here, here, here and here."

1152
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:09,874
"Beyond all borders
and encumbrances."

1153
01:47:09,958 --> 01:47:16,207
"l am here, here, here and here."

1154
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:37,207
"l am here, here.."

1155
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:44,290
"..here and here."

1156
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:46,790
Zaara.
- Shabbo.

1157
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:52,707
Tell him to get out of my sight.
l see him eνerywhere.

1158
01:47:53,833 --> 01:47:56,874
He's embedded in my soul, Shabbo.
Ask him to leaνe.

1159
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:59,957
Please tell him,
Shabbo. Please tell him.

1160
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:07,207
Please tell him, Shabbo.

1161
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:18,124
Yes, Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh.

1162
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:24,290
Hello, Captain Veer Singh?
l'm Shabbo speaking.

1163
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,040
Shabbo? l'm sorry.
l can't place you.

1164
01:48:33,333 --> 01:48:35,957
l'm calling from Zaara's house.

1165
01:48:42,125 --> 01:48:46,207
An unknown girl who l'd never
met before, was giving me..

1166
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:53,624
..the biggest news of my life.
She very simply told me that..

1167
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:59,124
..Zaara was in love with you
and she's about to get married.

1168
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:02,957
Come to Lahore, take Zaara away.

1169
01:49:03,708 --> 01:49:05,790
She'll never be able to
take this step all by herself.

1170
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:10,124
She says that you can
give your life for her.

1171
01:49:11,375 --> 01:49:13,624
And then she asked
me one last question.

1172
01:49:16,208 --> 01:49:25,040
How much do you love Zaara?

1173
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:30,290
l didn't have an answer
to that question then.

1174
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,374
Neither do l have one now.

1175
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:36,707
How much do l love Zaara?

1176
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:40,207
l don't know.

1177
01:49:41,291 --> 01:49:42,374
l know.

1178
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:51,040
An lndian Air Force Pilot is not
permitted to come to Pakistan.

1179
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:58,207
So, l know that the
minute you got this news..

1180
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:01,207
..you resigned knowing
fully well that you will..

1181
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:03,540
..never be able to rejoin.

1182
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:11,207
Then without telling
anyone you left for Lahore.

1183
01:50:11,291 --> 01:50:18,290
Not knowing the outcome of the
journey. Would you reach in time?

1184
01:50:19,791 --> 01:50:25,290
Would you meet Zaara?
Would Zaara come back with you?

1185
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:32,790
Or would you yourself be able to
return.. you didn't know anything.

1186
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:36,374
But you still left.

1187
01:50:39,208 --> 01:50:42,957
Perhaps, you don't know,
but l know..

1188
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:48,374
..how much you love Zaara. l know.

1189
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:16,874
Welcome, sir. l'm Shabbo.

1190
01:51:32,125 --> 01:51:35,540
l'm sorry, l couldn't arrange
for anything better than this.

1191
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:44,457
Wow, you can see the
entire city from here.

1192
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:50,707
There can't be a better room
than this in the whole of Lahore.

1193
01:51:53,625 --> 01:51:56,124
l didn't tell Zaara
that you're coming.

1194
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:02,624
l was scared that she would stop me.

1195
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:07,707
Day after tomorrow is her wedding.
She can't come out of her house.

1196
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:10,624
But tomorrow, she'll be going
to the shrine with everyone.

1197
01:52:12,291 --> 01:52:17,124
This is Munir, my younger brother.
He'll bring you to the shrine.

1198
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:19,624
Then we'll leave it to God.

1199
01:52:20,791 --> 01:52:23,624
So, Munir, my fate
is in your hands now.

1200
01:52:26,041 --> 01:52:28,124
Well, l'll leave.

1201
01:52:28,791 --> 01:52:29,874
Leaving?

1202
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:32,207
l got to leave,
if l'm away for long..

1203
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:33,957
..they'll start wondering
where l am.

1204
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:36,540
lf you need anything,
Munir's here.

1205
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:41,207
Thank you, Shabbo.

1206
01:52:44,625 --> 01:52:49,790
l didn't think you'd come,
but now, after meeting you..

1207
01:52:51,041 --> 01:52:55,040
..l'm sure you'll take
Zaara with you.

1208
01:52:56,958 --> 01:52:58,040
How could l not come?

1209
01:52:58,708 --> 01:53:03,540
My father says, "True love
happens only once in a lifetime."

1210
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:10,207
"And when it does, no God or
Allah can come in its way."

1211
01:53:12,208 --> 01:53:18,540
Tomorrow, we'll know how
true my love is in Allah's eyes.

1212
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:26,624
"l have broken all the
barriers of society."

1213
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:37,040
"l have left the
world and come to you."

1214
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:47,374
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1215
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:52,207
"Has come, has come.."
- "A besotted loνer has come."

1216
01:53:52,291 --> 01:54:01,707
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1217
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:07,207
"Besotted by you, besotted
by you, besotted by you.."

1218
01:54:07,291 --> 01:54:15,290
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1219
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:19,207
"He is completely devoted to you."

1220
01:54:19,291 --> 01:54:24,540
"He is completely obsessed by you."

1221
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:29,124
"He will die for your love."

1222
01:54:29,208 --> 01:54:38,624
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1223
01:54:39,625 --> 01:54:49,624


1224
01:54:54,125 --> 01:54:57,207
"lf l see your face.."

1225
01:54:57,291 --> 01:55:03,040
"l will forget all my sorrows."

1226
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:07,707
"These tears that are flowing,
this is all they are saying."

1227
01:55:07,958 --> 01:55:12,374
"You are beyond where l am,
but l have come here."

1228
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:29,374
"lf l could have one favour,
just a glance from your eyes.."

1229
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:38,874
"l would give my breath and heart.
l would give my entire life."

1230
01:55:38,958 --> 01:55:43,290
"Like the moth dies on the flame.."

1231
01:55:43,458 --> 01:56:15,290
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1232
01:56:15,625 --> 01:56:21,290
"A besotted lover.
A besotted lover."

1233
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:25,290
"A besotted lover."

1234
01:56:31,875 --> 01:56:37,874
"A besotted lover.
A besotted lover."

1235
01:56:38,041 --> 01:56:41,624
"Besotted. Besotted."

1236
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:48,207
"Your love story has
reached a critical juncture.

1237
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:54,124
She has to sacrifice
herself in your love."

1238
01:56:54,208 --> 01:57:09,124
"Your love story has
reached a critical juncture."

1239
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:32,540
He's conscious, but
he doesn't want to be.

1240
01:57:33,708 --> 01:57:36,374
He's listening to everything,
but he doesn't want to hear.

1241
01:57:37,916 --> 01:57:44,540
He's festering the shock deep
within as if he's punishing himself.

1242
01:57:47,291 --> 01:57:49,457
The next 24 hours are very critical.

1243
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:53,374
He may not be able
to take another shock.

1244
01:57:55,541 --> 01:57:59,624
The nurse is here and l will keep
coming every three or four hours.

1245
01:58:01,708 --> 01:58:03,040
Goodbye.

1246
01:58:12,291 --> 01:58:16,374
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.
They were all our own people.

1247
01:58:17,208 --> 01:58:19,790
Thank Allah that the news
hasn't spread in the city.

1248
01:58:20,875 --> 01:58:24,374
Anyway, tomorrow, after the wedding,
all the wagging tongues will stop.

1249
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:29,790
After all that's happened,
Raza's still ready to get married?

1250
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:33,790
Mariam ma'am, this marriage is
not only between Raza and Zaara.

1251
01:58:34,666 --> 01:58:36,207
There's a very deep and a serious..

1252
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:39,207
..pact behind it. lt's
on this foundation..

1253
01:58:39,291 --> 01:58:45,457
..that your husband's and
after him Raza's career rests.

1254
01:58:47,541 --> 01:58:53,874
Raza is very well aware of this.
Now, Zaara has to understand this..

1255
01:58:55,041 --> 01:58:58,207
lf this wedding doesn't
take place tomorrow then..

1256
01:58:58,291 --> 01:59:02,207
..Jehangir Hayaat Khan's
daughter's name will be..

1257
01:59:02,291 --> 01:59:05,040
..linked to an lndian man forever.

1258
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:09,124
Mr. Khan's years of
hard work will be ruined.

1259
01:59:10,041 --> 01:59:14,207
He'd lose the elections
for sure, and he'll face..

1260
01:59:14,291 --> 01:59:15,957
..a lifetime of disgrace.

1261
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:21,207
He will not be able to bear..

1262
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:25,040
..the weight of that shame.

1263
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:28,207
He won't be able to bear it.

1264
01:59:37,208 --> 01:59:39,624
Prepare for the wedding,
Brother Abdul

1265
01:59:41,208 --> 01:59:45,374
Tomorrow, there will be
a wedding in this house.

1266
01:59:57,875 --> 01:59:58,957
Where're you going?

1267
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:02,124
To Zaara's house.

1268
02:00:02,791 --> 02:00:05,624
Please don't go anywhere.
Let tonight pass.

1269
02:00:06,291 --> 02:00:10,624
Raza is looking for you everywhere.
The house is completely silent.

1270
02:00:11,041 --> 02:00:15,124
You can't go there and do anything.
Abba is in deep shock.

1271
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:18,707
l am the cause for the
shock and the solution.

1272
02:00:20,625 --> 02:00:22,957
l hadn't come here
just to see Zaara's face.

1273
02:00:24,958 --> 02:00:28,540
lf nobody speaks,
there's bound to be silence.

1274
02:00:30,666 --> 02:00:32,540
Someone has to make the first move.

1275
02:00:34,958 --> 02:00:38,124
Whether it brings on
a storm or a wedding.

1276
02:01:38,916 --> 02:01:45,290
My name is Mariam Hayaat Khan.
l'm Zaara's mother.

1277
02:01:46,916 --> 02:01:52,207
But perhaps, today, l have
lost the right to call her my own.

1278
02:01:54,125 --> 02:01:56,207
Because my
daughter's not mine anymore.

1279
02:01:57,666 --> 02:02:01,374
She's yours now.

1280
02:02:05,208 --> 02:02:07,457
l've come to ask you to
give my daughter back to me.

1281
02:02:09,125 --> 02:02:14,957
Please give us back our daughter.
Otherwise, her father will die.

1282
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:25,374
He won't be able to
bear the shame, he'll die.

1283
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:33,457
l've heard that you save lives.

1284
02:02:36,208 --> 02:02:38,374
You're the one who
saved Zaara's life.

1285
02:02:40,833 --> 02:02:45,374
So, now, please save
her father's life.

1286
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:53,790
l beg of you, please save his life.

1287
02:02:56,625 --> 02:02:58,124
Otherwise, he'll die.

1288
02:03:01,208 --> 02:03:02,707
He'll die.

1289
02:03:06,291 --> 02:03:11,374
A mother never has to beg to
her son. She just has to order.

1290
02:03:15,541 --> 02:03:19,790
Zaara has always and
will always belong to you.

1291
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:29,124
Did you think that l would've taken
Zaara away without your permission?

1292
02:03:33,208 --> 02:03:35,207
People say that love is blind..

1293
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:41,874
..so, we too were
blinded by our love.

1294
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:44,790
We could only see each other.

1295
02:03:46,291 --> 02:03:48,790
We didn't see if we
were harming anyone.

1296
02:03:50,291 --> 02:03:52,707
Hurting anyone or..

1297
02:03:54,791 --> 02:03:56,457
..if someone's life was at stake.

1298
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:00,040
We couldn't see anything.

1299
02:04:02,833 --> 02:04:04,457
But now, everything's clear.

1300
02:04:06,291 --> 02:04:10,374
Love can't be more
important than someone's life.

1301
02:04:14,291 --> 02:04:15,374
Don't you worry.

1302
02:04:17,541 --> 02:04:23,040
Zaara will marry the
person of her parent's choice.

1303
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:29,290
Prepare for the wedding.
l'll talk to Zaara.

1304
02:04:33,208 --> 02:04:40,040
l promise you that she will
willingly agree to the marriage.

1305
02:04:49,208 --> 02:04:53,290
ls every son from
your country like you?

1306
02:04:57,208 --> 02:04:58,374
l don't know.

1307
02:04:59,958 --> 02:05:06,124
But yes, every mother in my
country is exactly like you.

1308
02:06:04,791 --> 02:06:08,207
lf you think that
l've made a wrong..

1309
02:06:08,291 --> 02:06:10,790
..decision then just tell me.

1310
02:06:12,791 --> 02:06:15,124
No one will be able to stop
me from taking you to lndia.

1311
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:25,124
Your decision is absolutely right.

1312
02:06:27,625 --> 02:06:30,040
This has happened because of
one silly mistake on my part.

1313
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:35,457
l'd made a promise to
myself that l won't break.

1314
02:06:37,125 --> 02:06:39,290
lf only l'd been able to stop
myself when l saw you yesterday.

1315
02:06:39,375 --> 02:06:40,457
That..

1316
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:45,790
One silly mistake of yours will help
get me through the rest of my life.

1317
02:06:49,875 --> 02:06:56,040
lf you'd taken that away from me
then what would l take back with me?

1318
02:06:59,791 --> 02:07:01,540
Why is God doing this to us?

1319
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:04,957
l've never done
anything wrong in my life.

1320
02:07:06,208 --> 02:07:08,374
So, why is he punishing me
like this?

1321
02:07:17,458 --> 02:07:22,040
l'm keeping two
moments of your life with me.

1322
02:07:25,958 --> 02:07:27,707
And l'm giving two
moments of my life to you.

1323
02:07:31,041 --> 02:07:33,040
These two moments are
the symbol of our love.

1324
02:07:34,541 --> 02:07:35,957
These two moments make
our loνe story.

1325
02:07:40,208 --> 02:07:42,790
Now, we'll live our
lives on these two moments.

1326
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:52,957
But with a smile.

1327
02:07:57,208 --> 02:07:58,874
Neither will our love weaken.

1328
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:04,457
Nor will our duties
remain unfulfilled.

1329
02:08:10,916 --> 02:08:15,624
You'll honour your
parents by being a good wife.

1330
02:08:15,708 --> 02:08:22,457
And l'll fulfil father's
dreams back in the village.

1331
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:32,207
And after you've had
eight to ten children..

1332
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:35,707
..bring everyone along for a visit.

1333
02:08:37,916 --> 02:08:44,790
l'll take you for a ride on a
cycle and show you a new village.

1334
02:08:46,958 --> 02:08:53,040
But after haνing eight to ten kids,
l won't be able to sit on a cycle.

1335
02:08:54,208 --> 02:08:57,207
Yes, you've got a point.

1336
02:08:58,541 --> 02:09:02,624
Then l'll arrange for a tractor.

1337
02:09:20,291 --> 02:09:30,290


1338
02:09:39,666 --> 02:09:44,707
"Was that you or was
that just a fragrant wind?"

1339
02:09:44,916 --> 02:09:50,457
"Was that you or were
there colours everywhere?"

1340
02:09:51,208 --> 02:09:56,124
"Was that you or were
those shinning pathways?"

1341
02:09:56,375 --> 02:10:02,207
"Was that you or were those
songs resounding in the atmosphere?"

1342
02:10:02,541 --> 02:10:07,624
"Was it you l found,
or was it my destiny?"

1343
02:10:07,708 --> 02:10:13,874
"Was it you or was
there magic in the air?"

1344
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:18,957
"Just for two moments, the caravans
of our dreams made a stop."

1345
02:10:19,208 --> 02:10:24,707
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

1346
02:10:25,375 --> 02:10:30,457
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

1347
02:10:30,625 --> 02:10:48,457
"And then you went
your way and l went mine."

1348
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:28,957
lt's my wedding day today, Abba.

1349
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:34,124
Aren't you going to give me away?

1350
02:11:35,708 --> 02:11:38,707
Aren't you going to put your
hand on my head and bless me?

1351
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:51,124
Please forgive me, my dear.

1352
02:11:53,791 --> 02:12:00,540
l don't know whether this is
my obligation or my weakness.

1353
02:12:05,125 --> 02:12:06,457
Please forgive me.

1354
02:12:27,458 --> 02:12:33,457
This is a holy amulet.
This will protect you.

1355
02:12:34,916 --> 02:12:39,207
The moment you cross the border,
take out the coins..

1356
02:12:39,291 --> 02:12:42,124
..and give them to someone needy.

1357
02:12:51,458 --> 02:12:56,207
My religion does not permit,
but still, now onwards..

1358
02:12:56,291 --> 02:13:00,207
..l'll pray to Allah
everyday and ask him..

1359
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:04,124
..to give you Zaara
in every other birth.

1360
02:13:27,041 --> 02:13:28,124
l'm leaving.

1361
02:13:53,625 --> 02:13:54,707
Listen.

1362
02:13:58,708 --> 02:14:00,124
Sign here.

1363
02:14:02,458 --> 02:14:03,540
What's this?

1364
02:14:03,958 --> 02:14:05,040
Here.

1365
02:14:05,625 --> 02:14:09,457
lt says here that my
name is Rajesh Rathore.

1366
02:14:10,125 --> 02:14:12,957
l work for the
lndian lntelligence RAW.

1367
02:14:13,041 --> 02:14:14,624
Critical.. political.. secrecy.

1368
02:14:15,125 --> 02:14:18,040
Sending Pakistani secrets to lndia..
- That's correct.

1369
02:14:18,208 --> 02:14:22,124
No way. My name is Veer
Pratap Singh, ex-lndian Air Force.

1370
02:14:22,875 --> 02:14:24,207
l'd come here just two
days ago to visit somebody..

1371
02:14:24,291 --> 02:14:26,374
..and now, l'm going back.

1372
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:28,207
My passport is in my bag,
you can check.

1373
02:14:28,291 --> 02:14:30,540
We've found this in your bag.

1374
02:14:31,208 --> 02:14:34,207
Your name is written
clearly as Rajesh Rathore.

1375
02:14:34,541 --> 02:14:35,624
Let me see.

1376
02:14:35,791 --> 02:14:37,874
We have witnesses too
who can recognise you.

1377
02:14:40,208 --> 02:14:43,457
What's going on? Why
are you doing this?

1378
02:14:43,541 --> 02:14:45,874
Okay. You were just saying that
you were here to meet somebody.

1379
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:49,124
Tell us their names,
we'll call them.

1380
02:14:49,416 --> 02:14:51,790
Yes.. l'm..

1381
02:14:54,666 --> 02:14:55,749
l'm here..

1382
02:14:57,625 --> 02:14:58,707
Tell us.

1383
02:15:02,125 --> 02:15:03,207
l didn't come to meet anybody.

1384
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:05,374
Wow, what loνe!

1385
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:09,374
lf you take her name,
she will be disgraced?

1386
02:15:16,375 --> 02:15:22,290
You'll ruin yourself, but
won't let your love be cursed.

1387
02:15:23,375 --> 02:15:27,957
Yes, Mr. Veer. This is
exactly what l expected of you.

1388
02:15:31,208 --> 02:15:34,207
Mr. Veer, there's one thing
that is very special about..

1389
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,374
..both our countries.

1390
02:15:39,208 --> 02:15:44,624
On the basis of power and money,
anything is possible. lsn't that so?

1391
02:15:47,958 --> 02:15:51,207
What were you thinking?
That you could come here..

1392
02:15:51,291 --> 02:15:55,207
..and declare your
love for my wife-to-be..

1393
02:15:55,291 --> 02:15:58,207
..in front of everyone and leave.

1394
02:15:58,291 --> 02:16:03,707
And l'd stand aside
and watch the whole show?

1395
02:16:07,375 --> 02:16:13,290
Mr. Veer, l'm about to
live my life with a woman..

1396
02:16:14,708 --> 02:16:17,040
..who's in love with someone else.

1397
02:16:18,375 --> 02:16:23,040
And it's my bad luck that l can't
even back off from this marriage.

1398
02:16:25,875 --> 02:16:26,957
Can you imagine?

1399
02:16:30,291 --> 02:16:36,624
Can you imagine.. everyday of
my life will be a living hell.

1400
02:16:39,875 --> 02:16:42,040
You and Zaara were the
ones who dared to love.

1401
02:16:45,541 --> 02:16:46,874
Why should l be put to test?

1402
02:16:54,541 --> 02:16:57,540
Either your life
should be a living hell..

1403
02:16:59,708 --> 02:17:00,790
Or Zaara's.

1404
02:17:02,958 --> 02:17:04,040
Not mine

1405
02:17:11,458 --> 02:17:13,874
You take great pride
in your love, right?

1406
02:17:15,791 --> 02:17:17,790
So, now you're being tested.

1407
02:17:19,875 --> 02:17:26,290
l can make Zaara's life heaven or
hell. But it's all in your hands.

1408
02:17:28,708 --> 02:17:33,707
As long as you sit silently
within the four walls of a prison..

1409
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:39,374
..Zaara's life will be
more beautiful than heaven.

1410
02:17:41,625 --> 02:17:45,207
The moment you open your mouth,
Zaara's life will..

1411
02:17:45,291 --> 02:17:47,624
..become worse than hell.

1412
02:17:52,041 --> 02:17:55,457
Veer Pratap Singh's
identity has to be destroyed..

1413
02:17:55,541 --> 02:17:58,874
..in order to give Zaara
a good life.

1414
02:18:07,625 --> 02:18:11,457
Now, this.. is the true
test of love.

1415
02:18:14,791 --> 02:18:15,874
l'll take your leaνe.

1416
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:21,540
lt's time for the wedding.

1417
02:18:23,041 --> 02:18:24,207
Either you disgrace
the names of Zaara..

1418
02:18:24,291 --> 02:18:26,624
..and her family and
buy your freedom..

1419
02:18:27,458 --> 02:18:29,207
..or sign on those papers and..

1420
02:18:29,291 --> 02:18:31,290
..ensure a lifetime of
happiness for Zaara.

1421
02:18:33,708 --> 02:18:34,790
The decision is in your hands.

1422
02:18:37,041 --> 02:18:38,124
Goodbye.

1423
02:18:39,291 --> 02:18:49,290


1424
02:18:50,875 --> 02:18:58,624
"Why is there a tradition
of cruelty?"

1425
02:18:59,291 --> 02:19:05,540
"Why is the society the way it is?"

1426
02:19:06,208 --> 02:19:14,290
"These traditions of this world.. l
am completely oνerwhelmed by them."

1427
02:19:14,375 --> 02:19:16,207
"Do not ask what my
complaints are.."

1428
02:19:16,291 --> 02:19:18,540
"..or why l've been
given this unhappiness."

1429
02:19:18,625 --> 02:19:22,707
"What can l tell you,
why is love a crime."

1430
02:19:22,958 --> 02:19:31,374
"Why does one cry?
Why does this happen?"

1431
02:19:31,458 --> 02:19:35,624
"Why is everyone a
stranger to his heart?"

1432
02:19:35,708 --> 02:19:43,540
"What turn has this story taken?"

1433
02:19:43,625 --> 02:19:45,540
"What sort of world is
this that we live in?"

1434
02:19:45,625 --> 02:19:47,624
"Where sorrows wear
the face of happiness?

1435
02:19:47,708 --> 02:19:49,790
"What sort of world is
this that we live in."

1436
02:19:49,875 --> 02:19:51,957
"Where sorrows wear
the face of happiness?"

1437
02:19:52,041 --> 02:19:56,290
"Who do l call my own
and who is a stranger?"

1438
02:19:56,375 --> 02:20:04,290
"What turn has this story taken?"

1439
02:20:07,375 --> 02:20:11,707
Ms. Zaara Hayaat Khan,
daughter of Jehangir Hayaat Khan.

1440
02:20:12,041 --> 02:20:15,124
Your marriage has been
fixed with Raza Shirazi.

1441
02:20:15,291 --> 02:20:19,207
Son of Abdul Malik
Shirazi at a dowry of..

1442
02:20:19,291 --> 02:20:26,790
..Rs.5 million. Do you
accept this marriage?

1443
02:20:26,958 --> 02:20:35,124
"What turn has my story taken?"

1444
02:20:35,291 --> 02:20:38,374
Do you accept that your
name is Rajesh Rathore or no?

1445
02:20:38,541 --> 02:20:45,124
"My love story. My love story."

1446
02:20:45,375 --> 02:20:48,374
"What turn has my story taken?"

1447
02:20:48,458 --> 02:20:53,374
l accept.

1448
02:20:53,625 --> 02:20:57,624
"What turn has my story taken?

1449
02:20:57,708 --> 02:21:09,124
"What turn has my story taken?"

1450
02:21:12,375 --> 02:21:16,207
The bus that left from
Lahore met with an accident..

1451
02:21:16,291 --> 02:21:17,374
..before it reached lndia.

1452
02:21:19,208 --> 02:21:20,290
Nobody survived.

1453
02:21:21,875 --> 02:21:24,040
My name too was on
the passenger list.

1454
02:21:26,208 --> 02:21:31,040
l was happy that Maati and
father would hear about my death.

1455
02:21:33,625 --> 02:21:35,707
lf they got the news
that l was missing..

1456
02:21:36,875 --> 02:21:41,124
..then they wouldn't have been
able to live or die in peace.

1457
02:21:43,041 --> 02:21:47,957
Now, in lndia, Veer Pratap
Singh was dead and in Pakistan.

1458
02:21:48,875 --> 02:21:50,707
There was no sign of
Veer Singh left.

1459
02:21:53,958 --> 02:21:57,707
Now, his only identity was..

1460
02:22:00,125 --> 02:22:03,957
Prisoner number 786.

1461
02:22:17,708 --> 02:22:19,457
786.

1462
02:22:22,625 --> 02:22:25,707
My country owes you
22 years of your life.

1463
02:22:28,041 --> 02:22:30,624
l can't bring back these 22 years.

1464
02:22:34,458 --> 02:22:35,957
But l take a vow.

1465
02:22:37,125 --> 02:22:39,457
That l won't put flowers
on my father's grave until..

1466
02:22:40,041 --> 02:22:42,207
..Veer Pratap Singh
doesn't get his name..

1467
02:22:42,291 --> 02:22:45,540
..his identity and his country back.

1468
02:23:10,625 --> 02:23:13,040
So, Ms. Samiya Siddique,
this is your first case?

1469
02:23:13,125 --> 02:23:14,624
Yes.
- Congratulations.

1470
02:23:14,708 --> 02:23:15,790
Thank you, sir.

1471
02:23:15,875 --> 02:23:17,207
And you're the defence
counsel on behalf of the..

1472
02:23:17,291 --> 02:23:18,457
..Human Rights Commission?

1473
02:23:18,541 --> 02:23:20,790
That's right, sir.
- Good. That's good.

1474
02:23:21,708 --> 02:23:23,207
No one is
representing the Prosecution?

1475
02:23:23,291 --> 02:23:25,290
Well, sir, they should be coming.

1476
02:23:25,375 --> 02:23:26,457
May l come in sir?

1477
02:23:27,291 --> 02:23:28,624
Oh, it's you, Mr. Zakir.

1478
02:23:30,458 --> 02:23:33,040
Good morning, sir.
- Morning. Come in, take a seat.

1479
02:23:34,541 --> 02:23:35,874
That's Mr. Zakir Ahmed.

1480
02:23:36,541 --> 02:23:40,374
l know. l know him very well.

1481
02:23:42,708 --> 02:23:43,790
Come.

1482
02:23:43,875 --> 02:23:46,874
Sorry, Your Honour, you
know the traffic of Lahore..

1483
02:23:47,791 --> 02:23:49,207
Zakir sir, are you
presenting the case..

1484
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:52,540
..on behalf of the
Government of Pakistan?

1485
02:23:52,625 --> 02:23:55,707
Yes, sir. Actually, l've not
been to court since many days.

1486
02:23:55,958 --> 02:23:57,207
People maybe thinking that
Zakir Ahmed has forgotten..

1487
02:23:57,291 --> 02:23:59,124
..how to fight a case.

1488
02:23:59,791 --> 02:24:01,957
And anyway, l think this
case is very interesting.

1489
02:24:02,458 --> 02:24:03,540
What do you think, Saamiya?

1490
02:24:05,541 --> 02:24:08,290
So, you both know one another?

1491
02:24:08,791 --> 02:24:12,290
Of course. Saamiya was
working for us earlier.

1492
02:24:12,375 --> 02:24:15,207
But perhaps, she didn't
approve of the way we worked..

1493
02:24:15,291 --> 02:24:17,707
..so, she went over to
the Human Rights camp.

1494
02:24:18,541 --> 02:24:22,957
She's a very capable lady, it'll be
fun to fight the case opposite her.

1495
02:24:25,458 --> 02:24:29,290
There was a special purpose
for calling both of you here.

1496
02:24:30,958 --> 02:24:33,207
lt would be better if
both the parties can have..

1497
02:24:33,291 --> 02:24:35,457
..an out of court settlement.

1498
02:24:36,875 --> 02:24:38,790
Otherwise, the court has fixed
the date for day after tomorrow.

1499
02:24:39,625 --> 02:24:42,457
But yes, if the case does not
start the day after tomorrow..

1500
02:24:43,041 --> 02:24:47,290
..then the next date could be after
six months or maybe eνen a year.

1501
02:24:47,458 --> 02:24:50,707
We're ready, sir. But if the
defence needs more time then..

1502
02:24:50,791 --> 02:24:52,707
Defence is ready, sir.
- But Saamiya..

1503
02:24:53,708 --> 02:24:57,207
Sir, you can fix it for day after
tomorrow. My client has waited..

1504
02:24:57,291 --> 02:25:01,874
..for 22 years to get justice.
l can't make him wait any more.

1505
02:25:01,958 --> 02:25:04,040
Okay, then that's fixed.

1506
02:25:06,208 --> 02:25:07,874
l thank you both for coming here.

1507
02:25:09,125 --> 02:25:10,707
Good day.
- Good day, sir.

1508
02:25:13,708 --> 02:25:18,874
Okay, Saamiya. l'll see
you in court. Good day.

1509
02:25:25,208 --> 02:25:27,207
This was an impossible
case right from the start.

1510
02:25:27,375 --> 02:25:30,124
And now, with Zakir Ahmed's arrival,
there's absolutely no chance.

1511
02:25:31,291 --> 02:25:35,040
But this case is too small for
his portfolio.. l don't know why.

1512
02:25:35,458 --> 02:25:37,124
l can't understand anything.

1513
02:25:37,625 --> 02:25:41,124
Listen, just make any
excuse and drop this case.

1514
02:25:41,708 --> 02:25:44,207
This is your first case
and the way Zakir Ahmed..

1515
02:25:44,291 --> 02:25:48,540
..insults the opposition,
he'll ruin your career.

1516
02:25:48,875 --> 02:25:50,040
That's exactly what he wants.

1517
02:25:50,958 --> 02:25:53,207
What do you mean?
- Sahil, do one thing.

1518
02:25:53,458 --> 02:25:55,624
Go back to the office and
make a list of the witnesses.

1519
02:25:55,791 --> 02:25:56,957
l'll be there in a while.

1520
02:25:57,041 --> 02:25:59,290
But where're you going?
- To meet Zakir Ahmed.

1521
02:25:59,375 --> 02:26:02,040
Okay. What? Saamiya.

1522
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:11,290
Ms. Saamiya Siddique, you'd sworn
that you'd never step into my office.

1523
02:26:12,291 --> 02:26:14,540
Then how could you
bear to come here today?

1524
02:26:15,375 --> 02:26:17,207
There's nothing like that, sir.

1525
02:26:17,291 --> 02:26:20,624
Just that my
principles differed from yours.

1526
02:26:21,208 --> 02:26:25,207
And l thought that if l could not
respect working by your principles..

1527
02:26:25,291 --> 02:26:31,457
..then it's better that l leave.
- lnteresting, very interesting.

1528
02:26:32,458 --> 02:26:34,874
You've developed great
principles at a young age.

1529
02:26:35,125 --> 02:26:37,874
My principles have been passed
on to me as my father's legacy.

1530
02:26:39,458 --> 02:26:42,207
Saamiya, do you know that
you're the first person..

1531
02:26:42,291 --> 02:26:45,624
..who refused to take a
case offered by Zakir Ahmed.

1532
02:26:46,625 --> 02:26:49,957
Here, people wait for years in the
hope of getting their first case.

1533
02:26:51,125 --> 02:26:54,624
But l recognised your capability,
l chose you.

1534
02:26:55,291 --> 02:26:58,207
l ignored your age,
your inexperience..

1535
02:26:58,291 --> 02:27:00,290
..and even the fact
that you're a woman.

1536
02:27:00,875 --> 02:27:02,290
And what did you do
in spite of that?

1537
02:27:02,791 --> 02:27:04,707
You threw the case back in my face.

1538
02:27:05,958 --> 02:27:08,457
lt would've set
a criminal free, sir.

1539
02:27:09,291 --> 02:27:10,707
And according to me,
that would've been wrong.

1540
02:27:10,791 --> 02:27:13,707
lt's not a lawyer's job to
decide what's right or wrong.

1541
02:27:13,791 --> 02:27:15,040
lt's the court's job.

1542
02:27:15,208 --> 02:27:19,707
A lawyer's duty is to win the case
under any circumstance. Nothing else.

1543
02:27:21,208 --> 02:27:23,124
Well, that's the
difference between you and me, sir.

1544
02:27:24,041 --> 02:27:25,707
Your principle is to fight to win..

1545
02:27:26,208 --> 02:27:28,124
..and my principle is
to fight for the truth.

1546
02:27:29,458 --> 02:27:35,874
lnteresting, very interesting. So,
now you're giving me lessons in law.

1547
02:27:36,875 --> 02:27:38,957
This was all that was
left for me to experience.

1548
02:27:40,041 --> 02:27:44,874
Let's forget the past. Otherwise,
we'll keep opening up old wounds.

1549
02:27:46,291 --> 02:27:49,207
lf you've taken the trouble
to come all the way here..

1550
02:27:49,291 --> 02:27:52,040
..then it must be
something important. Sit.

1551
02:27:52,958 --> 02:27:55,790
What can Zakir Ahmed do for you?

1552
02:28:00,625 --> 02:28:03,540
Look, sir, being my first
case it's obvious that..

1553
02:28:04,458 --> 02:28:06,707
..l will make some mistakes.

1554
02:28:08,625 --> 02:28:11,540
And now that you're the opposition,
the problems will increase.

1555
02:28:12,875 --> 02:28:15,707
Because of some trifle on my part..

1556
02:28:16,458 --> 02:28:18,207
..l don't want that
lndian prisoner's freedom..

1557
02:28:18,291 --> 02:28:20,207
..to be revoked. Because..

1558
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:22,124
He's completely innocent.
That's true.

1559
02:28:23,541 --> 02:28:25,290
A great injustice has
been done to him, sir.

1560
02:28:26,958 --> 02:28:29,624
And he truly deserves his freedom.

1561
02:28:33,291 --> 02:28:35,624
Finally, you've
stooped down to our level.

1562
02:28:36,791 --> 02:28:41,124
Basically you've come asking for
help to win your first case, right?

1563
02:28:43,708 --> 02:28:48,040
Defeating Zakir Ahmed takes your
career off to a flying start. No?

1564
02:28:48,875 --> 02:28:52,457
Have you forgotten that Zakir
Ahmed has never lost a case as yet?

1565
02:28:52,875 --> 02:28:55,374
And now, it's νery
important for me to win this case.

1566
02:28:56,375 --> 02:28:58,207
Because l want to teach a lesson to..

1567
02:28:58,291 --> 02:29:00,207
..headstrong
youngsters like yourself..

1568
02:29:00,291 --> 02:29:05,707
..the repercussions of not
following Zakir Ahmed's principles.

1569
02:29:08,958 --> 02:29:10,624
What's the matter,
Ms. Saamiya Siddique?

1570
02:29:11,625 --> 02:29:14,207
Lost faith in your
principles of truth that you..

1571
02:29:14,291 --> 02:29:17,040
..come begging for a win?

1572
02:29:18,125 --> 02:29:19,207
Please forgive me, sir.

1573
02:29:19,291 --> 02:29:22,374
For a while, l thought
that you were almost human.

1574
02:29:24,125 --> 02:29:27,207
l just came to discuss if
there's any possibility of..

1575
02:29:27,291 --> 02:29:31,624
..giving this man his freedom
without taking this case to court.

1576
02:29:32,875 --> 02:29:35,457
But you mistook my
humanity to be my weakness.

1577
02:29:38,458 --> 02:29:43,290
Now, we'll meet in court. Be
prepared to lose your first case.

1578
02:29:44,458 --> 02:29:49,790
Because now, prisoner 786
will be sent to lndia, and..

1579
02:29:49,875 --> 02:29:52,207
..neither you nor the
State of Pakistan will stop me.

1580
02:29:58,291 --> 02:29:59,374
lnteresting.

1581
02:30:00,541 --> 02:30:01,624
Very interesting.

1582
02:30:06,958 --> 02:30:08,290
Can l ask you one question?

1583
02:30:10,375 --> 02:30:12,707
You hadn't spoken to
anyone in all these years..

1584
02:30:13,875 --> 02:30:16,040
..then why did you tell me
your story?

1585
02:30:20,708 --> 02:30:24,290
You called me by my name.

1586
02:30:25,625 --> 02:30:26,707
What?

1587
02:30:28,208 --> 02:30:32,874
You're the first person who
didn't doubt my innocence.

1588
02:30:33,458 --> 02:30:38,707
The first person who
belieνed that l am Veer Singh.

1589
02:30:43,041 --> 02:30:48,707
The truth is that in all these years,
l'd forgotten my own identity.

1590
02:30:52,208 --> 02:30:55,124
You reminded me of who l am.

1591
02:30:56,791 --> 02:30:59,290
You gave me respect by
calling me by my name.

1592
02:31:00,875 --> 02:31:04,790
Veer Pratap Singh.

1593
02:31:10,708 --> 02:31:15,207
For a prisoner who has
been insulted for the..

1594
02:31:15,291 --> 02:31:17,290
..last 22 years..

1595
02:31:18,875 --> 02:31:22,707
..this was a great thing.
Great thing.

1596
02:31:34,041 --> 02:31:35,207
Now, l'll eat some more, okay?

1597
02:31:41,875 --> 02:31:43,540
lt's our first day
in court tomorrow.

1598
02:31:43,875 --> 02:31:45,290
You remember your promise,
don't you?

1599
02:31:46,708 --> 02:31:47,790
That you're going to
change out of the garb of..

1600
02:31:47,875 --> 02:31:49,124
..786 and come as..

1601
02:31:49,208 --> 02:31:51,457
..Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh.

1602
02:31:53,875 --> 02:31:55,790
No.
- What?

1603
02:31:57,291 --> 02:31:59,874
Do you remember your promise?
- Of course, l remember it.

1604
02:31:59,958 --> 02:32:02,207
Under no circumstances am
l to mention the name of..

1605
02:32:02,291 --> 02:32:03,540
..Zaara or the Hayaat Khan family.

1606
02:32:04,625 --> 02:32:08,874
You keep your promise,
and l'll keep mine.

1607
02:32:38,791 --> 02:32:43,124
Your Honour, Defence would
like to call its first witness.

1608
02:32:47,458 --> 02:32:49,707
Defence calls its first witness.

1609
02:32:52,875 --> 02:32:54,874
Defence rests, Your Honour.

1610
02:33:58,041 --> 02:34:01,040
l call upon the
Prosecution to present its case.

1611
02:34:04,041 --> 02:34:05,124
Your Honour..

1612
02:34:06,458 --> 02:34:11,457
A man has been in prison
for the past 22 years..

1613
02:34:12,958 --> 02:34:15,207
..and that prison is in Pakistan.
And that man..

1614
02:34:15,291 --> 02:34:22,707
..who was imprisoned in a
Pakistani jail since 22 years is..

1615
02:34:23,625 --> 02:34:26,124
..an lndian.

1616
02:34:28,541 --> 02:34:35,207
Hearing this, you, me, and
everyone sitting in this courtroom..

1617
02:34:35,291 --> 02:34:40,874
..will have tears in their eyes.
And we'll hope for some way..

1618
02:34:41,541 --> 02:34:45,957
..that man can go back to
his country, to his home.

1619
02:34:47,041 --> 02:34:50,790
Because we are human
and we've been taught..

1620
02:34:50,875 --> 02:34:55,040
..to respect all human beings.
But Your Honour..

1621
02:34:56,291 --> 02:35:00,790
ln a court of law what man
can't see, the law can..

1622
02:35:01,625 --> 02:35:04,540
..and according to the law the
State is bigger than the individual.

1623
02:35:04,958 --> 02:35:07,957
And for a person who works against
the interests of the country..

1624
02:35:08,041 --> 02:35:11,290
..even being sentenced
to death 22 times is less.

1625
02:35:18,875 --> 02:35:21,624
This case is as transparent
as water.

1626
02:35:22,291 --> 02:35:24,790
There's no question of any doubt.

1627
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:27,457
Prosecution will in a
matter of just 30 minutes..

1628
02:35:27,541 --> 02:35:30,540
..and with the help of just three
witnesses, prove without a doubt..

1629
02:35:30,791 --> 02:35:33,207
..that the defendant
Rajesh Rathore is not worthy..

1630
02:35:33,291 --> 02:35:36,290
..of going back to his country or
his home until the day of his death.

1631
02:35:37,291 --> 02:35:38,374
That's all, Your Honour.

1632
02:35:40,208 --> 02:35:43,374
Now, l call upon the
Defence to present their case.

1633
02:35:46,291 --> 02:35:48,624
Ms. Siddique, best of luck.

1634
02:36:17,875 --> 02:36:22,040
Your Honour, Prosecution Counsel
Mr. Zaheer Khan was very quick to..

1635
02:36:22,125 --> 02:36:26,124
Zakir Ahmed says that this
case is as transparent as water.

1636
02:36:26,625 --> 02:36:29,040
But Mr. Zaheer Khan forgets..
- Ms. Saamiya Siddique.

1637
02:36:29,125 --> 02:36:32,207
My name is Zakir Ahmed! - Being
called by another name once..

1638
02:36:32,291 --> 02:36:34,957
..has infuriated you to such
an extent? Then just think..

1639
02:36:35,041 --> 02:36:36,207
..if you were called by
another name every single day..

1640
02:36:36,291 --> 02:36:37,374
..for 22 years..

1641
02:36:37,458 --> 02:36:39,040
Can you imagine what
would it feel like then?

1642
02:36:44,041 --> 02:36:47,207
Your Honour, this case is not being
fought to send an lndian back..

1643
02:36:47,291 --> 02:36:49,957
..to his country or his home.

1644
02:36:50,625 --> 02:36:52,207
This case is being
fought to give a man back..

1645
02:36:52,291 --> 02:36:55,207
..his identity, his individuality.
Someone is asking you..

1646
02:36:55,291 --> 02:37:00,874
..to give him back his name.
He's telling you that..

1647
02:37:01,708 --> 02:37:03,124
l am Veer Pratap Singh.

1648
02:37:03,958 --> 02:37:07,290
Ex-lndian Air Force Officer
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

1649
02:37:09,708 --> 02:37:12,040
Just give me back the
respectability of my name.

1650
02:37:12,958 --> 02:37:14,290
l don't want anything else.

1651
02:37:15,291 --> 02:37:19,457
Maybe not in 30 minutes
like the Prosecution Counsel..

1652
02:37:19,875 --> 02:37:23,207
..but l will definitely prove that
this man is not Rajesh Rathore..

1653
02:37:23,291 --> 02:37:26,874
..but Veer Pratap Singh. Then
whether to send him to lndia..

1654
02:37:27,041 --> 02:37:29,707
..or keep him in Pakistan,
that is in your hands.

1655
02:37:30,458 --> 02:37:31,624
That's all, Your Honour.

1656
02:37:33,291 --> 02:37:35,874
Now, Prosecution may
call upon it's witnesses.

1657
02:37:36,041 --> 02:37:42,040
l'd like to call upon my first
witness police officer Dilbaaz Khan.

1658
02:37:42,291 --> 02:37:47,624
Who had arrested
Rajesh Rathore 22 years ago.

1659
02:37:48,625 --> 02:37:58,624


1660
02:38:40,541 --> 02:38:45,624
"The winding Roads Beckon us."

1661
02:38:45,708 --> 02:38:50,374
"Where have we come to?"

1662
02:38:51,291 --> 02:38:56,374
"Eyes are shaded with dreams.."

1663
02:38:56,458 --> 02:39:06,457
"Where have we come to?"

1664
02:39:09,625 --> 02:39:15,040
Mr. Dilbaaz Khan, l know a
lot of time has passed by.

1665
02:39:15,875 --> 02:39:19,707
Could you tell the court
without any doubt or hesitation..

1666
02:39:20,375 --> 02:39:24,540
..who this man is?
- Yes, sir, l remember very well.

1667
02:39:25,041 --> 02:39:29,124
This man is an lndian spy. He's
an agent of RAW, Rajesh Rathore.

1668
02:39:30,208 --> 02:39:32,207
Some 22 years ago,
Anwar Ali and myself..

1669
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:34,207
We forced him to get
off a bus going from..

1670
02:39:34,291 --> 02:39:36,540
..Lahore to lndia and arrested him.

1671
02:39:37,625 --> 02:39:39,624
We had received an
intelligence report..

1672
02:39:39,875 --> 02:39:43,040
..that this man was
conspiring against Pakistan.

1673
02:39:43,125 --> 02:39:47,207
Good. - Mr. Anwar Ali, can you
tell me, if you found in his bag..

1674
02:39:47,875 --> 02:39:52,540
..a passport identifying
him as Rajesh Rathore?

1675
02:39:52,958 --> 02:39:57,040
Then how is it possible
that this same man's ticket..

1676
02:39:57,208 --> 02:39:58,957
..was booked in the
name of Veer Pratap Singh?

1677
02:39:59,625 --> 02:40:01,957
But sir, that was the thing..

1678
02:40:02,708 --> 02:40:05,207
Honour, this person
also had a passport..

1679
02:40:05,291 --> 02:40:07,790
..in the name of Veer Pratap Singh.

1680
02:40:08,208 --> 02:40:11,540
And how could one
person have two passports?

1681
02:40:12,208 --> 02:40:15,624
For this reason, our
suspicion changed to certainty.

1682
02:40:15,958 --> 02:40:21,290
And after we questioned him, he
himself signed the affidavit..

1683
02:40:21,375 --> 02:40:23,374
l, Rajesh Rathore..

1684
02:40:49,125 --> 02:40:54,457
"Golden warmth that
sprinkles our paths.."

1685
02:40:54,541 --> 02:40:59,707
"..has warmed our lives."

1686
02:41:10,291 --> 02:41:15,790
"The earth sleeps
wearing a blanket of ice."

1687
02:41:15,875 --> 02:41:20,874
"Our hearts are afire."

1688
02:41:21,041 --> 02:41:26,457
"Winds change course,
bodies shiver."

1689
02:41:26,541 --> 02:41:36,457
"Where have we come to?"

1690
02:41:40,875 --> 02:41:44,040
l've being seeing him
for the last ten years.

1691
02:41:44,958 --> 02:41:47,540
He was always quiet
and kept to himself.

1692
02:41:47,958 --> 02:41:50,040
He never communicated with anyone.

1693
02:41:51,041 --> 02:41:54,207
But whenever a
prisoner was ill or upset..

1694
02:41:54,291 --> 02:42:00,457
..he would go forth to
heal him and comfort him.

1695
02:42:01,958 --> 02:42:06,457
l don't know if he is Veer
Pratap Singh or Rajesh Rathore..

1696
02:42:07,708 --> 02:42:10,874
..for me, he's just 786.

1697
02:42:12,875 --> 02:42:13,957
God's own man.

1698
02:42:16,625 --> 02:42:21,707
Yes, sir. This Hindu here
is Allah's noble servant.

1699
02:42:22,875 --> 02:42:25,207
He's spent 22 years in prison..

1700
02:42:25,291 --> 02:42:28,707
There can't be greater
punishment than this.

1701
02:42:30,875 --> 02:42:35,540
Send him back to his homeland.

1702
02:42:36,708 --> 02:42:40,124
Send him back.

1703
02:42:40,291 --> 02:42:42,207
Mr. Majid Khan, it looks like..

1704
02:42:42,291 --> 02:42:46,040
..you have no great love
for your country Pakistan.

1705
02:42:47,125 --> 02:42:51,540
lf it were up to you, then every
person who had spied upon Pakistan..

1706
02:42:51,625 --> 02:42:55,207
..every conspirator,
should be set free by the court.

1707
02:42:55,791 --> 02:42:59,207
Sir, that's not what l meant..
- Just reply with a yes or a no.

1708
02:42:59,291 --> 02:43:02,457
Mr Majid Khan, only
with a yes or no.

1709
02:43:05,125 --> 02:43:06,207
No.
- Good.

1710
02:43:07,208 --> 02:43:08,290
Your witness.

1711
02:43:11,208 --> 02:43:12,540
No questions, Your Honour.

1712
02:43:27,208 --> 02:43:32,624
"l wonder when it will
stop pouring."

1713
02:43:32,791 --> 02:43:38,124
"You've got excuses
a plenty to love."

1714
02:43:48,708 --> 02:43:54,207
"lt seems like there's
a procession of stars."

1715
02:43:54,291 --> 02:43:59,207
"Night is resplendent
only for us."

1716
02:43:59,291 --> 02:44:01,624
"Dreams sparkle.."

1717
02:44:01,708 --> 02:44:04,457
"They light up our hearts."

1718
02:44:04,541 --> 02:44:20,124
"Where have we come to?"

1719
02:44:33,041 --> 02:44:38,207
The next date for this
case is after one week..

1720
02:44:38,291 --> 02:44:40,790
..on Monday, 21 st March.

1721
02:44:41,791 --> 02:44:43,874
On that day, l will
hear the Defence's case.

1722
02:44:44,541 --> 02:44:47,290
And immediately after that,
l will pass my judgement.

1723
02:44:48,291 --> 02:44:50,290
Defence should be
ready with their case.

1724
02:44:51,208 --> 02:44:53,207
Adjourned.

1725
02:45:17,791 --> 02:45:19,207
l'll have to mention Zaara's name.

1726
02:45:19,708 --> 02:45:20,790
No.

1727
02:45:20,875 --> 02:45:23,207
Please.. for once..

1728
02:45:23,291 --> 02:45:25,207
Let me bring Zaara
or any one person..

1729
02:45:25,291 --> 02:45:26,790
..from the Hayaat
family to the court..

1730
02:45:26,875 --> 02:45:28,707
..and in a moment, the verdict
will swing to our favour.

1731
02:45:29,625 --> 02:45:30,707
Absolutely not.

1732
02:45:31,708 --> 02:45:35,790
Why don't you try and understand?
We're losing this case.

1733
02:45:36,708 --> 02:45:39,624
The court does not have
time for prisoners like you.

1734
02:45:41,958 --> 02:45:44,790
ln this country, there are too
many prisoners and very few courts.

1735
02:45:46,208 --> 02:45:49,790
A lot of prisoner's cases
come up after they're dead.

1736
02:45:51,458 --> 02:45:53,290
You'll never get such
an opportunity again.

1737
02:45:54,625 --> 02:45:59,457
You'll die lying right here..
you'll die. Don't you understand?

1738
02:46:08,291 --> 02:46:11,040
Zaara must be the
mother of two by now.

1739
02:46:16,458 --> 02:46:22,790
She perhaps has a 21 -year-old
daughter and a 1 9-year old-boy.

1740
02:46:24,375 --> 02:46:27,707
She must've passed through all
the good and bad times of her life.

1741
02:46:30,291 --> 02:46:35,624
Her days, her evenings must've
settled down to a fine rhythm.

1742
02:46:39,791 --> 02:46:42,124
lt must now be a
peaceful life for Zaara.

1743
02:46:44,458 --> 02:46:45,540
Zaara.

1744
02:46:48,541 --> 02:46:51,624
And tomorrow, you'll drag her to
court and in front of everyone..

1745
02:46:51,708 --> 02:46:53,457
..you'll ask her
who's Veer Pratap Singh?

1746
02:46:54,625 --> 02:46:55,957
Questions will be raised.

1747
02:46:57,208 --> 02:46:58,957
What is the relationship
between Veer and Zaara?

1748
02:46:59,041 --> 02:47:01,624
And no one will be able
to understand the answers.

1749
02:47:01,708 --> 02:47:03,540
No one will understand.

1750
02:47:05,625 --> 02:47:09,207
ln an instant, Raza
Shirazi will divorce her.

1751
02:47:09,291 --> 02:47:12,374
Zaara's life will be ruined.

1752
02:47:16,458 --> 02:47:18,790
She must be living peacefully.

1753
02:47:22,875 --> 02:47:26,374
For the last 22 years, l
haνe been guarding her honour.

1754
02:47:28,708 --> 02:47:34,624
Today, how can l trample
upon her honour and go home?

1755
02:47:44,208 --> 02:47:45,790
l can't do that, Saamiya.

1756
02:47:46,708 --> 02:47:49,957
And l know you won't
be able to do it either.

1757
02:47:58,458 --> 02:48:04,957
l'm sorry, for a while, being a
lawyer made me forget my humanity.

1758
02:48:07,541 --> 02:48:08,624
l forgot..

1759
02:48:08,708 --> 02:48:13,207
That Veer and Zaara's names
can never be taken together.

1760
02:48:19,375 --> 02:48:23,624
Now, there's only one way out.
l'll have to go to lndia..

1761
02:48:27,875 --> 02:48:31,540
..to bring Veer Pratap
Singh's identity from his country

1762
02:48:33,208 --> 02:48:34,290
Time is short.

1763
02:48:35,208 --> 02:48:37,707
l'm leaving. Take care.

1764
02:48:42,958 --> 02:48:44,040
Saamiya..

1765
02:48:51,041 --> 02:48:56,874
Until now, this amulet has protected
me, now, it will protect you.

1766
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:06,874
lf l lose..

1767
02:49:08,458 --> 02:49:10,040
..will you forgive me?

1768
02:49:14,208 --> 02:49:15,374
On one condition.

1769
02:49:18,708 --> 02:49:20,207
Every day, you must bring me..

1770
02:49:20,291 --> 02:49:22,790
..sweets.

1771
02:49:28,541 --> 02:49:29,624
Take care.

1772
02:49:52,458 --> 02:49:53,707
Excuse me.

1773
02:50:02,375 --> 02:50:06,374
Can you show me where
Chaudhary Sumer Singh's house is?

1774
02:50:06,458 --> 02:50:09,040
Yes. The largest house
at the corner there.

1775
02:50:09,125 --> 02:50:11,374
That's Chaudhary sir's house.
- Thanks.

1776
02:50:11,458 --> 02:50:15,290
But who're you looking for?
- For Mr. Singh and his wife.

1777
02:50:16,458 --> 02:50:18,790
lt's been years
since both of them died.

1778
02:50:24,708 --> 02:50:27,874
But if you want to see the house,
you're most welcome.

1779
02:50:28,208 --> 02:50:29,707
That house is always open.

1780
02:50:30,041 --> 02:50:33,624
l'm in a bit of a hurry,
please forgive me, goodbye.

1781
02:51:24,625 --> 02:51:27,040
Zaara, oh, Zaara..

1782
02:51:40,041 --> 02:51:41,124
l'm not sparing you.

1783
02:52:05,708 --> 02:52:07,707
Hey, who're you? What do you want?

1784
02:52:11,041 --> 02:52:12,207
Why are you crying?

1785
02:52:16,625 --> 02:52:18,290
Say something,
are you deaf or what?

1786
02:52:21,041 --> 02:52:23,707
Shabbo, look, here's a visitor.

1787
02:52:24,041 --> 02:52:25,707
And you Jassi.. come here.

1788
02:52:29,625 --> 02:52:31,540
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

1789
02:52:33,208 --> 02:52:35,124
l'll tell your mother
that you aren't studying.

1790
02:52:37,208 --> 02:52:38,790
Yes.. tell me..

1791
02:52:39,041 --> 02:52:40,540
What do you want?

1792
02:52:41,541 --> 02:52:43,457
You're Shabbo?

1793
02:52:44,375 --> 02:52:45,874
Who else can l be?

1794
02:52:46,458 --> 02:52:49,957
And she's..

1795
02:52:50,875 --> 02:52:51,957
Zaara?

1796
02:52:52,791 --> 02:52:54,540
You came asking this?

1797
02:52:54,791 --> 02:52:57,457
ls she Zaara Hayaat Khan?

1798
02:52:59,875 --> 02:53:01,707
How do you know this name?

1799
02:53:02,125 --> 02:53:06,790
She's Jehangir Hayaat
Khan's daughter from Lahore?

1800
02:53:10,875 --> 02:53:11,957
Who are you?

1801
02:53:17,625 --> 02:53:22,540
After hearing about Veer's death,
Zaara called off the marriage.

1802
02:53:25,625 --> 02:53:27,874
Abba himself got her divorced.

1803
02:53:30,208 --> 02:53:33,207
Zaara came here to help
father and Maati to make..

1804
02:53:33,291 --> 02:53:35,540
..Veer's dream come true.

1805
02:53:38,125 --> 02:53:43,790
Raza settled overseas.
Abba left politics.

1806
02:53:45,541 --> 02:53:48,207
He died two years later.

1807
02:53:50,458 --> 02:53:54,290
A few years later ma'am also died.

1808
02:53:56,625 --> 02:53:59,707
The Hayaat Khan name
no longer existed.

1809
02:54:02,541 --> 02:54:05,207
Today, father and Maati are no more.

1810
02:54:06,625 --> 02:54:10,040
But she won't go back. She says..

1811
02:54:10,791 --> 02:54:17,957
"My soul is embedded here.
Now, l'll live and die here."

1812
02:54:25,541 --> 02:54:27,457
Which century are
these people from, Shabbo?

1813
02:54:29,208 --> 02:54:33,207
There's a Veer who
so easily sacrificed..

1814
02:54:33,291 --> 02:54:35,624
..22 years of his life..

1815
02:54:36,958 --> 02:54:39,207
..to protect Zaara's honour..

1816
02:54:40,541 --> 02:54:45,207
..and there's Zaara who
spent 22 years of her life..

1817
02:54:45,291 --> 02:54:51,290
..in a strange land to
keep Veer's dream alive.

1818
02:54:54,541 --> 02:54:56,290
Are they humans
pretending to be gods..

1819
02:54:58,625 --> 02:55:00,290
..or are they gods
disguised as humans?

1820
02:55:30,625 --> 02:55:36,040
This was my mother's.

1821
02:55:39,208 --> 02:55:44,207
22 years ago, Mariam
Hayaat Khan had tied..

1822
02:55:44,291 --> 02:55:47,290
..this amulet on an lndian..

1823
02:55:47,375 --> 02:55:50,707
..while bidding him goodbye,
so that it would protect him.

1824
02:55:53,875 --> 02:55:58,457
That person did not reach
lndia but for 22 years..

1825
02:55:59,041 --> 02:56:01,290
..this charm has been
protecting him.

1826
02:56:04,875 --> 02:56:06,290
That person's name is..

1827
02:56:08,541 --> 02:56:09,874
Veer Pratap Singh.

1828
02:56:18,208 --> 02:56:23,374
He's in prison, in a jail in Lahore.

1829
02:56:25,958 --> 02:56:27,290
l am his lawyer.

1830
02:56:29,541 --> 02:56:33,290
And l've come to take you to him.

1831
02:56:44,625 --> 02:56:51,790
For the last 22 years, God has
been testing you both intensely.

1832
02:56:54,625 --> 02:56:58,874
But now, not even God can
separate Zaara and Veer.

1833
02:57:00,625 --> 02:57:04,707
Not even God can
separate Zaara and Veer.

1834
02:57:19,208 --> 02:57:23,540
Mr. Sahil Farooque, l'm asking
you where is the Defence Counsel?

1835
02:57:23,875 --> 02:57:25,624
Your Honour, she must be on her way.

1836
02:57:25,708 --> 02:57:28,040
lt seems like she has
decided to give up the case.

1837
02:57:28,125 --> 02:57:29,374
Please begin with the proceedings

1838
02:57:29,708 --> 02:57:30,874
lrresponsible..

1839
02:57:31,625 --> 02:57:34,957
Absolutely irresponsible of the
Defence Counsel not to have arrived.

1840
02:57:36,208 --> 02:57:39,040
Mr. Sahil Farooque, do
you have anything to say?

1841
02:57:39,708 --> 02:57:42,207
Your Honour, Saamiya..

1842
02:57:42,291 --> 02:57:44,374
l mean my learned
colleague should be here soon.

1843
02:57:44,958 --> 02:57:46,040
There's no problem..

1844
02:57:46,125 --> 02:57:49,124
There is a problem, Mr. Farooque.
There is a problem.

1845
02:57:51,041 --> 02:57:54,457
lt's no small matter to waste
the court's time in this manner.

1846
02:57:55,458 --> 02:57:58,207
Especially when l
had clearly specified..

1847
02:57:58,291 --> 02:58:01,207
..that this day has been
reserved for the Defence's case.

1848
02:58:01,291 --> 02:58:03,374
Then what's the reason for
her absence from the court?

1849
02:58:03,708 --> 02:58:06,790
lt's obvious that the
Defence does not have a case.

1850
02:58:07,458 --> 02:58:09,207
Silence on the defendant's
part and..

1851
02:58:09,291 --> 02:58:11,707


..no one appearing on
behalf of the Defence..

1852
02:58:30,583 --> 02:58:40,582


1853
02:59:08,541 --> 02:59:13,624
"For you, l have
lived all these days."

1854
02:59:14,125 --> 02:59:17,790
"With my lips sealed."

1855
02:59:18,375 --> 02:59:27,457
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1856
02:59:27,791 --> 02:59:34,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1857
02:59:34,291 --> 02:59:42,624
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1858
02:59:42,875 --> 02:59:52,207
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1859
02:59:52,625 --> 03:00:01,790
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my lips sealed."

1860
03:00:02,208 --> 03:00:09,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1861
03:00:09,291 --> 03:00:17,290
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1862
03:00:42,125 --> 03:00:46,790
"Life has brought me.."

1863
03:00:47,208 --> 03:00:51,707
"..a volume of old times."

1864
03:00:51,958 --> 03:01:01,374
"Life has brought me a
volume of old times."

1865
03:01:01,875 --> 03:01:11,207
"And l am surrounded
by countless memories."

1866
03:01:11,541 --> 03:01:20,290
"Unasked, l have now found
all the answers l sought."

1867
03:01:20,875 --> 03:01:30,040
"Look, what l yearned
for and what l got."

1868
03:01:30,208 --> 03:01:35,374
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1869
03:01:35,958 --> 03:01:45,457
"Have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1870
03:02:05,458 --> 03:02:24,790
"How can l describe the
cruelty of this world?"

1871
03:02:25,041 --> 03:02:34,374
"l was ordered to live,
but without you."

1872
03:02:34,875 --> 03:02:43,624
"lgnorant are those who say
to me that you are unknown."

1873
03:02:44,208 --> 03:02:53,374
"So many ordeals, were
heaped on me by this world."

1874
03:02:53,625 --> 03:03:00,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1875
03:03:00,291 --> 03:03:08,207
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1876
03:03:08,291 --> 03:03:13,624
"For you, l have
lived all these days."

1877
03:03:14,041 --> 03:03:17,874
"With my lips sealed."

1878
03:03:18,208 --> 03:03:27,457
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1879
03:03:27,875 --> 03:03:39,790
"But in my heart, the flames of love,
haνe always been burning for you."

1880
03:03:39,958 --> 03:03:52,540
"Only for you."

1881
03:04:07,875 --> 03:04:10,040
Zaara Hayaat Khan's testimony..

1882
03:04:12,208 --> 03:04:17,040
..and photographs and documents
presented by her prove that..

1883
03:04:18,375 --> 03:04:23,457
..this man is not Rajesh Rathore
but that he is Veer Pratap Singh.

1884
03:04:25,291 --> 03:04:29,207
And to prevent disgracing the
honour of a Pakistani girl..

1885
03:04:29,291 --> 03:04:34,290
..Veer Pratap Singh
signed that affidavit.

1886
03:04:36,041 --> 03:04:42,707
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
this court exonerates you.

1887
03:04:48,875 --> 03:04:54,124
Order. Order.
- Go, Veer Pratap Singh, go.

1888
03:04:55,458 --> 03:04:59,040
You have the right to return to your
country with your head held high.

1889
03:05:03,375 --> 03:05:09,040
And for the precious 22 years
of your life wasted in prison..

1890
03:05:10,041 --> 03:05:14,790
..the State of Pakistan and this
court asks for your forgiνeness.

1891
03:05:17,208 --> 03:05:20,874
lf you wish to speak, you may.

1892
03:05:40,375 --> 03:05:46,040
l, prisoner number 786..

1893
03:05:47,208 --> 03:05:49,290
..look through the bars of the jail.

1894
03:05:51,208 --> 03:05:55,040
l see days, months,
years change to eons.

1895
03:05:57,708 --> 03:06:02,790
From the soil of this land comes
the fragrance of my father's fields.

1896
03:06:05,875 --> 03:06:10,290
This burning sun reminds me
of my Maati's cool buttermilk.

1897
03:06:13,541 --> 03:06:18,207
This rain brings along with
it the swings of my seasons.

1898
03:06:19,875 --> 03:06:23,957
This winter fills me with the
warmth of the fires of my Lodi.

1899
03:06:27,625 --> 03:06:35,124
They say this is not your country
then why does it feel like mine?

1900
03:06:38,458 --> 03:06:45,040
He says l am not like him,
then why does he look like me?

1901
03:06:47,541 --> 03:06:52,457
l prisoner number 786 look
through the bars of the jail.

1902
03:06:54,541 --> 03:06:58,457
l see an angel who has
descended from heaven.

1903
03:07:00,375 --> 03:07:05,290
She calls herself
Saamiya and she calls me Veer.

1904
03:07:07,208 --> 03:07:11,957
She's a complete stranger,
but treats me as her own.

1905
03:07:13,958 --> 03:07:18,790
Hearing her truthful words,
l feel like living once more.

1906
03:07:21,208 --> 03:07:25,790
Hearing her promises and vows, l
feel like doing something more.

1907
03:07:27,958 --> 03:07:30,290
They say that she is
no one of mine then..

1908
03:07:32,375 --> 03:07:34,790
..why does she fight
the world for me?

1909
03:07:37,208 --> 03:07:43,290
He says that l'm not like her
then why does she look like me?

1910
03:07:51,208 --> 03:07:56,957
l, prisoner number 786, look
through the bars of the jail.

1911
03:08:00,041 --> 03:08:04,957
l see my Zaara wrapped in
the colours of my village.

1912
03:08:07,875 --> 03:08:12,290
ln making my dreams come true,
she has forgotten her own.

1913
03:08:13,708 --> 03:08:18,374
ln serving my people, she
has left behind her own.

1914
03:08:21,291 --> 03:08:26,290
Now, l feel like filling
her being with happiness.

1915
03:08:28,541 --> 03:08:33,540
l feel like living
another lifetime for her.

1916
03:08:36,208 --> 03:08:38,290
They say that my country
is not hers..

1917
03:08:41,791 --> 03:08:43,707
..then why is she staying
in my home?

1918
03:08:44,791 --> 03:08:50,374
He says that l'm not like her,
then why does she look like me?

1919
03:08:54,458 --> 03:08:56,457
l, prisoner number 786..

1920
03:08:59,458 --> 03:09:03,790
..look through the bars of the jail.

1921
03:09:47,208 --> 03:09:48,874
Thank you.

1922
03:09:48,958 --> 03:09:52,457
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1923
03:09:53,791 --> 03:09:54,874
Saamiya.

1924
03:09:56,625 --> 03:09:57,790
Congratulations.

1925
03:10:00,291 --> 03:10:01,374
Thank you.

1926
03:10:05,041 --> 03:10:06,290
This was my last case.

1927
03:10:07,875 --> 03:10:10,290
l'm giving up law.

1928
03:10:12,208 --> 03:10:16,457
Because you've taught me
that l'm not fit for this work.

1929
03:10:18,458 --> 03:10:22,207
l always thought that a
country's progress is measured..

1930
03:10:22,291 --> 03:10:24,290
..by its judicial system.

1931
03:10:25,208 --> 03:10:26,790
But now, l understand that..

1932
03:10:27,208 --> 03:10:28,957
..the future of both
these countries is..

1933
03:10:29,958 --> 03:10:31,790
..in the hands of
youngsters like you.

1934
03:10:33,041 --> 03:10:38,874
Who do not measure humans as big
-small, man-woman, Hindu-Muslim..

1935
03:10:41,208 --> 03:10:44,207
Who don't rake up
bitter war memories of..

1936
03:10:44,291 --> 03:10:47,290
.. 1 947-1 965 and 1 999
on every pretext.

1937
03:10:48,541 --> 03:10:54,040
Who wish to address the future
with the truth and only the truth.

1938
03:10:55,708 --> 03:11:00,540
And there's no stopping a
country where truth prevails.

1939
03:11:04,458 --> 03:11:05,540
Thank you, Saamiya.

1940
03:11:06,458 --> 03:11:09,790
Thank you for teaching me
the value of truth and justice.

1941
03:11:13,541 --> 03:11:18,290
Your father would've been proud of
you, he would've been very proud.

1942
03:11:21,375 --> 03:11:22,457
l am.

1943
03:11:26,208 --> 03:11:27,290
Goodbye.

1944
03:12:12,625 --> 03:12:17,207
Veer had lost Zaara in Pakistan.
So, Veer and Zaara..

1945
03:12:17,291 --> 03:12:19,707
..will be joined on Pakistani soil.

1946
03:12:27,208 --> 03:12:32,957
Here, take this. Make
our Zaara yours foreνer.

1947
03:12:51,708 --> 03:12:56,624
You said, Veer and Zaara's
names can never be taken together.

1948
03:12:57,625 --> 03:13:02,374
Now, Veer and Zaara's names
haνe been joined together forever.

1949
03:13:06,958 --> 03:13:08,457
What Veer says is true.

1950
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:13,790
You're an angel..
sent only for us by God.

1951
03:13:18,958 --> 03:13:24,040
Go ahead. Look, your
country awaits you.

1952
03:13:44,875 --> 03:13:45,957
Come, Zaara.

1953
03:13:48,458 --> 03:13:49,540
Let us go home.

1954
03:14:05,541 --> 03:14:11,874
"Gold like land, vast blue sky."

1955
03:14:12,208 --> 03:14:18,207
"Gold like land, vast blue sky,
every season is colourful."

1956
03:14:18,291 --> 03:14:32,290
"Such is my country."

1957
03:14:45,208 --> 03:15:04,207
"Lived l have for you.
Only for you."

1958
03:15:04,458 --> 03:15:09,457
"Distances between us
since ages.."

1959
03:15:10,375 --> 03:15:19,374
".. l have covered them.
Only for you."

1960
03:15:19,541 --> 03:15:38,707
"Lived l have for you.
Only for you."

1961
03:15:38,791 --> 03:15:44,040
"Distances between us
since ages.."

1962
03:15:44,625 --> 03:15:53,624
".. l have covered them.
Only for you."

1963
03:15:53,708 --> 03:16:04,624
"Only for you."
- "Only for you."
