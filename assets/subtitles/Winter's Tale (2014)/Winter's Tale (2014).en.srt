1
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,766
<i>What if, once upon a time,
there were no stars in the sky at all?</i>

2
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,927
<i>What if the stars are not what we think?</i>

3
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,122
<i>What if the light from afar doesn't come
from the rays of distant suns..</i>

4
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,363
<i>but from our wings
as we turn into angels?</i>

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,088
<i>Destiny calls to each of us.</i>

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,044
<i>And there is a world behind the world
where we are all connected.</i>

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,443
<i>All part of a great and moving plan.</i>

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,287
<i>Magic is everywhere around us.</i>

9
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,204
<i>You just have to look.</i>

10
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,606
<i>Look.</i>

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,444
<i>Look closely.</i>

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,566
<i>For even time and distance
are not what they appear to be.</i>

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,246
Next.

14
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,451
Sir, you're next.

15
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,401
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

16
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,846
You'll have to go back.

17
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,121
What?

18
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,405
No. No. Why? We..

19
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,004
It's pulmonary.

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,402
Ah.. what about the baby?
Is there place for him?

21
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,802
If we have to go back, we leave him.

22
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,921
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,162
No. You do not understand.

24
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,683
<i>We are all connected.</i>

25
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,290
<i>Each baby born carries a miracle inside.</i>

26
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,406
<i>A unique purpose.</i>

27
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,769
<i>And that miracle is promised
to one person and one person alone.</i>

28
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,245
<i>We are voyagers,
set on a course towards destiny..</i>

29
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,643
<i>to find the one person
our miracle is meant for.</i>

30
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,325
<i>But be warned:</i>

31
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,528
<i>As we seek out the light..</i>

32
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,841
<i>darkness gathers.</i>

33
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,601
<i>And the eternal contest between Good and
Evil is not fought with great armies..</i>

34
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,688
<i>but one life at a time</i>

35
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,525
Stop right there! Get back here, Pete!

36
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,208
- Get back here!
- Unh!

37
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,885
Pete, them was just orders!

38
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,041
No. Not like that.

39
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,091
We have him now.

40
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,810
Let's do it slowly..

41
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,571
with the knives.

42
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,090
Get him!

43
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,725
Horse. Horse.

44
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,401
Horse.

45
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,485
Go, go, go!

46
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,687
Go on. WV!

47
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,888
Whoa. Whoa, whoa! Whoa.

48
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,088
Horse! Come on! Other away!

49
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,601
Other way!

50
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,807
Horse!

51
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,881
What are you?

52
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,928
He's got the goddamn horse.

53
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,490
Good afternoon.

54
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,211
The butler told me
I should leave my coat on.

55
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,771
Mm.

56
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,242
We have fever in the house.

57
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,045
Is it your wife that needs spectacles,
Mr. Penn?

58
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,247
Dead.

59
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,686
I'm sorry.

60
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,450
It's eight years ago.

61
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,687
Still, you never stop missing them.

62
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,645
It's for my daughter.

63
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,090
She'll be finished soon.

64
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,970
It is nice, isn't it? Brahms.

65
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,246
Beverly..

66
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,291
this man has come
to make you some new glasses.

67
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,241
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

68
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,966
No, no.

69
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
My sister..

70
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,891
she had it.

71
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,085
Oh, I'm sorry.

72
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,167
Better this way..

73
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,040
or this way?

74
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,805
How old was she?

75
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,366
Your sister?

76
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,846
Twenty..

77
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,525
when she died.

78
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,729
You never think you're as old
as you're ever going to get.

79
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,366
No.

80
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,485
I suppose not.

81
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,046
This way..

82
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,966
or this?

83
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,521
First.

84
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,520
The fever,
it can make things wonderful.

85
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,691
Even now..

86
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,889
I can see winter as it turns around
the room on the light..

87
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,848
darting from white lances..

88
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,810
to rays..

89
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,605
to silver crosses..

90
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,367
to the optical glass..

91
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,769
to the flames,
to the reflective windows.

92
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,164
And illuminating each of us.

93
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,289
The sicker I become..

94
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,966
the more clearly I can see
that everything is connected by light.

95
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,729
Do you have glasses for that?

96
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,721
Hey, Cecil.

97
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,485
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

98
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,085
Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

99
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,730
And, boy, can he jump.

100
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,131
I want a saddle, oats..

101
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,761
and I want a nice blanket for him.
Cashmere.

102
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,488
He's the best duff you ever stole, Pete.

103
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,290
Oh, he ain't duff, Cecil.

104
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,411
He's me new partner.

105
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,000
Aren't you, horse?

106
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,246
- You can't keep hiding out up in the attic.
- Why?

107
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,961
Word went out, Pearly's tripled the reward.
He's got his guys looking everywhere.

108
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,726
Ugly son of a bitch.
He found me this morning.

109
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,245
Horse saved my life.

110
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,249
I think I'll get out of town till summer,
you know? Me and horse.

111
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,882
Steal enough to get us by. Just let
this whole thing blow over, you know?

112
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,204
I don't see Pearly much
as the blowing-over kind.

113
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,041
Yeah.

114
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,568
- That's because you worry too much, Cecil.
- Heh.

115
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,684
Just board him for me, will you?

116
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,441
Thanks.

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,001
Pete!

118
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,971
You forgot your..

119
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,600
change.

120
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,968
I was wondering when you'd get here.

121
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,204
<i>May I have your attention please</i>

122
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,449
<i>Train number 43..</i>

123
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,246
<i>is now boarding on Track Number 4.</i>

124
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,481
Enter!

125
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,966
The fire at St. Paddy's is set
for Sunday Mass.

126
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,565
That's not what matters to me.

127
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,291
We got the word out to everyone:
500 for his head.

128
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,451
- And the horse?
- The same. Seems like a lot for a horse.

129
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,849
Well, that's because it's not a horse.

130
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,806
- It's a dog.
- You just said it was a..

131
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,321
As far as we can tell,
he hasn't left the city.

132
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,166
Woola boys are watching all the bridges.
New York's not that big. We'll find him.

133
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,084
- You better.
- I know, boss.

134
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,806
People are scared and unhappy
all over the city.

135
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,884
Miracles are down by half.
More if you count Brooklyn.

136
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,643
What's so special about Peter?

137
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,724
You used to like him.
Never met me a better thief.

138
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,407
- Why all of a sudden, we gotta kill him?
- Romeo, Romeo.

139
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,525
Do you spend time..

140
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,330
wondering about the world?

141
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,490
The workings of things.

142
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,561
- No, sir.
- Right. Well..

143
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,770
better not to start now.

144
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,329
Do you think I, uh, steal gold and gems
for wealth?

145
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,001
No.

146
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,162
What makes these most precious..

147
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,329
it's the way they accept the light.

148
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,844
Peter Lake is human.

149
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,491
But that horse..

150
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,328
That horse might leave a trail.

151
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,645
And Yahtzee!

152
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,643
Grand Central Station.
Let's go and kill him.

153
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,406
And while we're at it,
let's try and grab that horse.

154
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,005
You just said it was a dog.

155
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,331
Go and get the boys.

156
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,401
Hi.

157
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,921
Hey.

158
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,809
Everybody's all packed
to go up to the lake tomorrow.

159
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,481
I'll come up the next day,
sweetheart.

160
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,842
Daddy just has to get my tent ready.

161
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,286
So you can stay cold?

162
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,169
So I can stay cold.

163
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,841
You can't die, Bev.

164
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,411
Sweet girl..

165
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,369
it's not up to me.

166
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,364
Tell me again.

167
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,082
There's this great dance..

168
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,006
and we all have our part.

169
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,009
And when we're done here..

170
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,005
if it's after one life, or a thousand..

171
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,687
we rise up into the sky
and we become stars.

172
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,848
Tell me their names again.

173
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,446
Castor..

174
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,006
Pollux..

175
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,206
Capella..

176
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,926
It's a great night's work, my friend.

177
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,409
We head south to Florida.

178
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,050
Or Maryland, maybe.

179
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,646
That sounds like the kind of place
you might like.

180
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,723
All right, let's go.

181
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,890
Horse.

182
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,490
Horse.

183
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,801
Come on.

184
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,370
Horse, it's gonna be light soon.
We need to get out of town.

185
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,488
Pearly's got a hundred eyes
looking after us.

186
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,006
Come on.

187
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,560
Come on.

188
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,286
Hor..

189
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,484
You're just getting greedy now.

190
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,127
Fine.

191
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,646
But this is our last score.

192
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,130
Don't know who's a bigger fool:

193
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,921
A horse who won't listen to his master,
or a master who listens to his horse.

194
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,930
God, make me cold.

195
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,926
Hello, you beauty.

196
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,840
James..

197
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,963
James the Lesser, Bartholomew..

198
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,846
Squeaks.

199
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,841
What?

200
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,806
It squeaks.

201
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,521
Age.

202
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,441
You have a gun.

203
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,321
Right.

204
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,881
What are you doing here?

205
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,202
I was just robbing the place,
you know.

206
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,961
Or that was the idea, anyway.

207
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,564
Is that still your intention?

208
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,324
Uh..

209
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,241
No.

210
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,280
No, it isn't.

211
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,601
Well, then..

212
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,929
I suppose the polite thing to do
would be to offer you a cup of tea.

213
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,001
Wow.

214
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,007
You did understand the part about me..

215
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,682
coming here to steal from you, yeah?

216
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,169
It's my father, technically.

217
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,810
I broke in.

218
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,961
Where?

219
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,647
He takes epic measures to bar entry.

220
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,247
Well, actually, you left the door
to the roof wedged open. So I just..

221
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,528
- Did I?
- Yeah.

222
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,249
I must stop doing that.

223
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,401
Yeah.

224
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,528
I mean, you should be scared.

225
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,361
Well, I'm not.

226
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,249
No, I can see that.

227
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,848
The tea is lovely.

228
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,209
It's called Lapsang Souchong.

229
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,363
It's black and from China.

230
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,205
It's too hot for me to drink..

231
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,086
but the smell always reminds me
of London.

232
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,963
I've never been to London.

233
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,487
I didn't think so. No. Heh.

234
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,570
I was born there.

235
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,961
What's wrong with you,
if you don't mind me asking?

236
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,485
Consumption.

237
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,404
I'm 21 and I've never been kissed
on the mouth.

238
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,283
Sorry, that came out wrong.

239
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,568
I don't know anyone, you see.

240
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,481
I can't go out. I can't dance.

241
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,201
I sleep in a tent on the roof
to keep my body temperature within reason.

242
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,921
I have maybe..

243
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,286
according to one doctor who came up
from Baltimore, a year and a half.

244
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,887
In Boston, they said six months.

245
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,323
But that was eight months ago..

246
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,451
so really, I'm already two months dead.

247
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,371
I'm Peter Lake.

248
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,483
And where are you from, Peter Lake?

249
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,881
A boat.

250
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,645
- A boat?
- Yeah.

251
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,884
I never knew my parents.
Boat washed up ashore in Brooklyn.

252
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,891
So I was told.

253
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,281
And you steal things.

254
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,363
I do steal things.
Yeah, from time to time.

255
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,924
It wasn't always that way, though.

256
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,687
I always wanted to be a mechanic.
You know, I always had a knack..

257
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,522
for fixing things,
getting to the insides of things.

258
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,451
Like safes.

259
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,404
Well, that's how it ended up, anyways.

260
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,563
Lately, I've been having a bit
of a disagreement with an old boss.

261
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,809
I should imagine disputes
in your line of work are hard to settle.

262
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,450
Challenging, yeah.

263
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,731
What's the best thing you've ever stolen?

264
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,047
I'm beginning to think
I haven't stolen it yet.

265
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,249
Aren't you the charmer.

266
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,531
It's been lovely.

267
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,004
Lovely to meet you, Peter Lake.

268
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,130
Listen, I have to leave New York.

269
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,805
A few months at most.

270
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,288
Let that disagreement blow over.

271
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,921
But maybe when I get back,
I was wondering if..

272
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,003
I'm going to the country myself.

273
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,247
And by the time you get back..

274
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,884
I'll already be dead.

275
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,291
Please don't steal anything
on your way out.

276
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,450
Horse.

277
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,643
What have you gotten me into, horse?

278
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,249
Table! That one.

279
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,250
Mr. Soames, sir.
How many are you going to have?

280
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,004
Just keep them coming.

281
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,122
I'll tell you what they're trying to do.

282
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,648
What they're trying to do
is to fill the whole sky with stars.

283
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,568
They got little spots all picked out
up there for each and every virtuous soul.

284
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,247
Ain't no room in the heavens
for the likes of us, though, boys. Heh.

285
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,643
No room for Pearly Soames.
No room at all.

286
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,211
I wonder how they choose
the color of their wings.

287
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,923
I've always wanted wings.

288
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,243
I'd like a pair of wings myself,
you know?

289
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,401
Anything more, sir?

290
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,847
Oh, yes, please.

291
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,086
I would like to have
a South African spotted eagle owl..

292
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,288
uh, if you could butterfly it,
thank you..

293
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,011
and pan-fry it, uh,
with some potatoes would be lovely.

294
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,642
A little bit of parsley on top.
Take off the beak and the feet, please.

295
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,689
I'm sorry, sir. Don't got no owl.

296
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,646
Find her.

297
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,206
You find her, and you're gonna find him.

298
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,807
- Find who?
- The girl.

299
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,167
- What girl?
- The red-haired girl.

300
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,367
Which red-haired girl?

301
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,362
That one. You see, Romeo?
That red-haired girl.

302
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,768
The one who is his destiny.

303
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,410
That all of it, miss?

304
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,205
All of it? Heh.

305
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,806
No, not even close.

306
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,521
What?

307
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,685
I just remembered the day we
pulled you out of the drink in
that silly little boat.

308
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,205
I need some friendly advice. I meta girl.

309
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,203
- Oh, I see.
- We've nothing in common.

310
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,566
<i>Hmm.</i>

311
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,449
- She's dying.
- Well, aren't we all?

312
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,888
Well, not just dying. She's consumptive.

313
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,486
- Ah.
- Near death.

314
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,530
We've only just met.

315
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,363
- I feel like I've known her a thousand years.
- Hmm.

316
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,720
Pearly's on top of me. If I don't get out
of town, I'm as good as killing myself.

317
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,531
Peter, is there a question here?

318
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,245
What should I do?

319
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,930
When I think of her..

320
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,044
I've never felt this way before.

321
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,361
Why now?

322
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,408
Peter, our people have 10 songs.

323
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,929
The songs tell us
that inside of each of us is a miracle.

324
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,204
And that miracle is meant for one person,
and one person alone.

325
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,763
And when we're close,
the universe reaches down..

326
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,605
and helps us fulfill our destiny.

327
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,360
And the universe helps us?
How, exactly?

328
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,966
Well, the universe sends us spirit guides.

329
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,084
Sometimes they speak to us
through small children.

330
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,641
They often appear as animals.

331
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,531
One is Athansor. He's the Dog of the East.

332
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,691
He sometimes appears as a white horse.

333
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,286
Perhaps this girl is the person
that your miracle is for.

334
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,889
But if so, know this:

335
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,850
- Chaos has agents too.
- What are you talking about?

336
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,525
God and the devil?

337
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,400
Angels and demons?

338
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,842
Those are some of the newer names, yes.

339
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,286
All I know..

340
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,491
is that I'm pulled to her..

341
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,088
like air when I'm under the water.

342
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,484
So, what are you standing here
talking to me for?

343
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,770
Driver?

344
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,411
I'm afraid he's become indisposed.

345
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,281
Suddenly come into a small fortune
by his standards, I imagine.

346
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,450
Pearly Soames.

347
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,486
And you might be?

348
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,881
Beverly Penn.

349
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,645
Beverly Penn.

350
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,690
Well..

351
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,003
Peter does like to reach above
his station, doesn't he?

352
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,249
And you've got a touch of the fever,
haven't you, button?

353
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,968
Already only half here.

354
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,725
Interesting.

355
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,405
You know Peter?

356
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,321
Peter Lake?

357
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,925
Know him? Oh, yes.

358
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,008
We're associates, you might say.

359
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,401
Well..

360
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,649
past tense, anyway.

361
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,002
The boy had such potential.

362
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,170
Could he steal.

363
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,802
Like art, like physics.

364
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,762
I raised him as my own.

365
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,123
I had him pegged to inherit the keys
to the kingdom.

366
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,803
But little Peter..

367
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,247
he started to having ideas.

368
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,370
There's how to steal a diamond brooch
without spilling blood.

369
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,410
Here's how to take a ring
and leave the finger.

370
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,610
But, you see, Beverly Penn..

371
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,491
in my line..

372
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,731
it's the ripples that
give the work meaning.

373
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,611
Ideas..

374
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,442
they can do more good than harm.

375
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,163
And that would be the opposite
of the plan, you see.

376
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,247
It's doing harm that is the very point.

377
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,368
I might not go upstate until tomorrow.

378
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,283
- Hmm.
- No bother at all.

379
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,647
- I'd be very happy to pay you.
- Beautiful.

380
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,327
Sick.

381
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,763
- Too young to die.
- I'm not afraid of you.

382
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,888
I'll bet that you're who
his miracle is for.

383
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,281
My father has a strict policy
when it comes to kidnappers.

384
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,681
He has to save you.
If you can't be saved by him..

385
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,641
job's done.

386
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,730
Mission accomplished.

387
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,051
I love blood on the snow, Beverly Penn.

388
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,842
Especially virginal blood.

389
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,691
Unspoiled.

390
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,281
Unmolested.

391
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,921
Beverly!

392
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,321
No!

393
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,609
- Hold on.
- Peter Lake.

394
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,602
- Go fast!
- Yes, clearly.

395
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,770
We can't outrun them forever.

396
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,002
I know! We have to get above the city.

397
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,048
Go north along the river.

398
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,009
- Peter! That's way too far down!
- Hold on!

399
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,446
- Hold on?
- Hold on!

400
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,885
Peter. Peter, wait!

401
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,409
How is that even possible?

402
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,847
I don't know. This horse.

403
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,291
We can't follow them up there.

404
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,802
- Why not?
- The rules.

405
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,248
A little dispute a couple hundred years ago.
Shortsighted.

406
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,404
Well, we almost had him.

407
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,041
Almost is not good enough, Romeo.

408
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,609
Do you want the job or not, Dingy?

409
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,124
I need to see the Judge.

410
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,001
Are you all right?

411
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,890
All the excitement..

412
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,966
and your condition.

413
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,845
I'm perfect.

414
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,126
Good.

415
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,251
Head upriver.

416
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,246
Beverly!

417
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,126
Thank you.

418
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,203
- Okay?
- Yeah.

419
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,249
Hello, little one.

420
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,211
Mm.

421
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,080
I've only known the city.

422
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,568
It's called the Lake of the Coheeries.

423
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,927
I've been coming here
since I was a little girl.

424
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,448
My father says nothing happens here
that isn't supposed to.

425
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,881
Hello.

426
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,122
Hi. I'm Willa.

427
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,363
Willa. How are you, Willa?

428
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,649
Are you Beverly's boyfriend?

429
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,284
Let's go inside.

430
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,444
I'm sure Father will have something to say
about the matter.

431
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,922
Do you take wine with your meals?

432
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,006
Sometimes.

433
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,161
That's good.

434
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,329
We'll have wine tonight.

435
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,481
Okay.

436
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,240
- Would claret be all right with you?
- Anything.

437
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,201
But, uh, don't you pronounce it..

438
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,887
"claret"?

439
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,441
No. Claret.

440
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,321
You pronounce the T. Just as in fillet.

441
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,681
Fillet?

442
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,444
I always thought it was "fillet."

443
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,170
No, it's fillet.

444
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,007
Just as in wallet. You don't say
"wallet," do you? You say wallet.

445
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,801
<i>I see.</i>

446
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,489
- You know what?
- Sir?

447
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,363
You look like a crook.

448
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,042
Who are you? What do you do?

449
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,602
What is your relationship to Beverly?
Are you aware of her special condition?

450
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,127
What are your motivations,
intentions and desires?

451
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,362
Tell the absolute truth. Don't elaborate.

452
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,241
Stop if a neighbor,
child or servant comes in. And be brief.

453
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,448
Be brief?
These are complicated questions.

454
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,331
If you were one of my journalists,
you'd be finished by now.

455
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,006
God created the world in six days.
Ape him.

456
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,527
- Heh. I'll try.
- It's unnecessary.

457
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,920
- All right.
- Unnecessary.

458
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,121
My name is Peter Lake.

459
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,170
You're right, I'm a thief,
and I'm a damn good one.

460
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,367
I love Beverly.

461
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,045
Our relationship goes by no name.

462
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,770
I have no intentions.

463
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,687
I desire her, and I am moved by love.

464
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,881
Do you understand?

465
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,050
How do I know that you're not moved
by vanity or curiosity?

466
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,885
How do I know you're not here
for the money in this family?

467
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,247
I was an orphan.
Orphans don't have vanity.

468
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,887
I'm not sure why,
but one needs parents to be vain.

469
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,765
And the money?

470
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,404
I wouldn't take a penny from you,
for a start.

471
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,963
I would accept no favors,
not even a kind word said on my behalf.

472
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,929
And of her condition?

473
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,608
I've never loved much before.

474
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,006
So death..

475
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,202
hasn't been something to be avoided.

476
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,363
But now when I think of losing her..

477
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,247
Is it possible to love someone
so completely they simply can't die?

478
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,361
No.

479
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,005
But I'm a thief..

480
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,202
as you so keenly observed.

481
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,726
Can't I steal just one life?

482
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,809
Well, we'll see about you.

483
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,047
Does that mean
I might try some of that claret now?

484
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,089
Let's both, shall we?

485
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,491
One more thing:

486
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,967
She sleeps in her tent on the roof.

487
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,325
And you do not.

488
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,731
Some locals found me
while they were digging up clams.

489
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,168
I spent a few years on the bounce
from orphanage to orphanage.

490
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,482
Just got on better
on the streets, I suppose.

491
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,926
What did you do?

492
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,685
To live, I mean.

493
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,605
I danced and sang
in the streets for coins.

494
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,604
Picked pockets.
I lived with two girls for a while.

495
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,049
- Two?
- Two.

496
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,531
Aren't you the playboy.

497
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,364
Ah, it wasn't like that.

498
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,766
Mostly.

499
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,610
I was young.
And then Pearly scooped me up.

500
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,331
He said I had talent.

501
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,687
I take it it wasn't for your singing.

502
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,527
It's not working, is it?
You're not getting any cooler.

503
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,407
No.

504
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,603
Here, let me try something.

505
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,321
Come here.

506
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,244
Actually, this isn't helping.

507
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,925
Can you hear your heart?

508
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,449
When the fever comes,
it's about the only thing I can hear.

509
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,209
When you crack your first safe, your heart
beats so loud you can't hear the tumblers.

510
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,083
You have to learn to quieten it, slow it
down, so you can work between the beats.

511
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,603
The trick to it is lists.

512
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,890
Meaningless words..

513
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,965
you say, as you exhale
to slow down the breath.

514
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,524
Inhale quietly..

515
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,531
exhale and say the words
until the breath is gone.

516
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,283
- Got it?
- I think so.

517
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,121
Do you need a list?
Animals are good. Colors. Saints.

518
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,241
Castor.

519
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,766
Pollux.

520
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,160
Capella.

521
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,165
Ursa Major.

522
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,725
Ursa Minor.

523
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,966
Polaris.

524
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,491
Peter..

525
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,642
- Huh.
- It's working.

526
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,326
Go on.

527
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,931
Pleiades.

528
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,126
Perseus.

529
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,725
Cassiopeia.

530
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,641
Hello.

531
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,330
Those are mine.

532
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,207
The paper too.

533
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,850
Yeah, I figured as much.

534
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,205
I couldn't sleep.

535
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,924
I like to draw by the moon.

536
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,811
See, I'm not very good
and the light helps hide it.

537
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,006
Is it Beverly?

538
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,242
I don't know anyone else with red hair.

539
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,850
Do you love her?

540
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,091
With all my heart.

541
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,765
Do you swear?

542
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,885
I swear.

543
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,326
Okay.

544
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,246
Come with me.

545
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,450
It's a princess bed.

546
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,050
I made the neighbor boys make it for her.

547
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,370
They listen to me.

548
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,371
Daddy told me a story
about a princess who died..

549
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,161
and a kiss that made her
not dead anymore.

550
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,370
If you kiss her here..

551
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,124
she won't die.

552
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,046
I know it.

553
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,401
Okay?

554
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,405
Say okay.

555
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,767
Okay.

556
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,841
Okay.

557
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,003
You can put me to bed now.

558
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,330
Pearly Soames.

559
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,004
I have an appointment.

560
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,929
Hello, Pearly.

561
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,368
Ah. Hello, Your Honor. Sir.

562
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,361
Oh, of course.

563
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,565
Eh..

564
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,083
I'm here to request special dispensation
regarding the boundaries of jurisdiction.

565
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,241
Proceed.

566
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,851
I'd like permission to travel north
of the city, Your Honor.

567
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,166
Wow, that is quite a request, Pearly,
considering what happened last time.

568
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,051
Well, you know,
it was a misunderstanding.

569
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,321
Yeah.

570
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,002
Well, demon, let's get this over with.

571
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,242
Pearly Soames, Warden of Manhattan
and the Five Boroughs..

572
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,641
on what grounds
do you make this request?

573
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,247
I've come to believe that a human
is on the verge of using his miracle..

574
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,971
which would be a formidable
advancement for the other side.

575
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,329
- Evidence?
- Presence of guardian angels, Your Honor.

576
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,324
Both the White Dog of the East
and Cecil Mature.

577
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,130
- What else?
- Well, I've had a vision.

578
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,087
A red-haired girl I've drawn in a fugue
with the blood of a virgin.

579
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,291
Pearly, that could be anyone.

580
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,365
Okay, Lu, I mean, he's already been seen
with a girl matching that exact description.

581
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,406
Uh..

582
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,051
She's dying.

583
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,321
And he loves her?

584
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,843
Purely, entirely, and with all his heart.

585
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,401
So you believe it is his miracle
to save her.

586
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,483
I do, sir. Yes, Your Honor. I do.

587
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,722
A man's destiny is often
not what it seems.

588
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,167
I understand that, sir, I do. I do.
I understand that.

589
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,402
But I.. uh. I, uh..

590
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,688
I have a feeling about this one,
you know?

591
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,003
You trained him.

592
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,967
Picked him up off the street.

593
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,487
The son you never had.

594
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,165
Embarrassing, no?

595
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,691
Shit happens.

596
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,287
Your Honor..

597
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,401
I just need the permission to go north.

598
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,687
Denied.

599
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,804
This one is too personal.

600
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,531
Your prohibition
from the northern territories is upheld.

601
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,966
Lucifer!

602
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,721
I need to stop this one, now!

603
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,601
Now?

604
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,482
You have no idea what "now" is.

605
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,401
Now, I was flying.

606
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,561
Now, I breathed fire
and I ate them as they fled.

607
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,725
Now, I whipped my tail
and the winds trembled.

608
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,168
Now, I am hidden
in this pale shade of flesh and bone.

609
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,011
Now, I am witness
to man's eternal salvation.

610
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,924
Now, I am witness to his demise.

611
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,970
Do not speak to me of time, demon.

612
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,489
Its simplest ebbs and turns
elude your meager understanding.

613
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,768
Find another way! Now!

614
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,049
Let me take you dancing.

615
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,530
How about New Year's Eve?

616
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,569
Can you? Dance, I mean.

617
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,927
I have done. A bit.

618
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,127
Some.

619
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,850
Well, I know them all.

620
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,210
From books, anyway.

621
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,251
It seems wonderful.

622
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,845
So it's sorted, then.

623
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,320
I can't, Peter.

624
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,451
Is it me? Because I'm not a gentleman
with a driver and the right clothes?

625
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,011
You know it's not that.

626
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,641
What, then?

627
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,971
Well, my father says
that dancing will kill me.

628
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,485
Ah.

629
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,044
Fathers are overprotective.

630
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,524
Coat stays on.

631
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,761
We're all to go next door
for an afternoon peppermint.

632
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,921
What is it? What's wrong?

633
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,083
It's been happening all afternoon.

634
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,608
Has something to do with the furnace.

635
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,081
Your father's been down there
for an hour with the mechanic.

636
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,642
He sent the rest of the staff to the
Gamelys' and asked that you join them.

637
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,962
Now, Willa, please.

638
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,127
Go on next door, Bev. I'll, uh,
see if I can help them out downstairs.

639
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,770
Miss. The little one.

640
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,290
Miss.

641
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,244
She's jammed up.

642
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,607
Let me take a look.

643
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,411
We're in the red already.
You should go next door.

644
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,404
What about you? This sounds like
it's about to blow sky-high.

645
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,528
Go down with the ship, as it were.

646
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,330
Yeah, it's a house, not a ship.

647
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,204
My wife made this place.

648
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,442
She picked every stitch of furniture.

649
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,251
Every pillow,
every sconce and window frame.

650
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,125
Wouldn't do to leave it.

651
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,769
Listen, you should go now.

652
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,644
Winston, go, go.

653
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,847
Now, you.

654
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,050
The steam can't come.

655
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,403
- Are you mad?
- Wait.

656
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,606
I have a sympathy for complex systems.

657
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,649
How things go together and come apart.

658
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,851
Like locks.

659
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,691
Aah!

660
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,168
Just need to feel for the connection.

661
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,846
That pipe's too hot, avoid it, avoid it.

662
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,725
This one's blocked.
Means the problem's before it.

663
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,846
It's stuck.

664
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,769
- Uh..oh.
- Uh..oh?

665
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,528
- Oops.
- Oops?

666
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,411
Am I light or heavy?

667
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,688
Heh. Light as a feather.

668
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,570
Good night, Peter Lake.

669
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,085
Good night, little Willa.

670
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,931
My father says you saved all our lives.

671
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,041
He's overstating things.
It was just him and the furnace man's.

672
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,051
And yours.

673
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,569
Yeah, mine too, I suppose.

674
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,563
Thursday is New Year's Eve.

675
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,169
I'd like to go dancing.

676
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,841
You take great risk coming to me for this.

677
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,047
You owe me, angel.

678
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,605
And this is me calling in my marker.

679
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,641
You know I cannot directly intervene.

680
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,565
Relax, flyboy.

681
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,327
It just makes the heart
beat a little faster.

682
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,048
Someone would have to be real excited
to experience any deleterious effects.

683
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,641
You know the rules.

684
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,242
Debts must be paid.

685
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,403
And then ours is settled.

686
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,040
Then we're square. Yes, indeed.

687
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,089
You're a good man yourself. Well done.

688
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,645
I've been wondering.

689
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,410
With all these trying to go up..

690
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,050
and you come down.

691
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,044
Was it worth it, becoming human?

692
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,009
Or was it an impulse buy?

693
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,000
You must miss the wings, right?

694
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,325
Oh, come on. You must.

695
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,050
You look good in that suit.

696
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,845
You..

697
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,362
are impossibly beautiful.

698
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,166
So are you.

699
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,600
Stop it.

700
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,202
Or I'll melt all the snow I'm standing on.

701
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,245
Give me a chance
and you'll melt all the snow in the world.

702
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,241
Come on.

703
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,164
My mother always said that it was bigger
on the inside than it was on the outside.

704
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,330
- Shall we?
- Yes.

705
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,000
You're late.

706
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,806
I'm sorry.

707
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,682
If you don't make love to me now,
no one ever will.

708
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,008
Well, that's exactly what I'll do, then.

709
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,886
Places.

710
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,886
What, love?

711
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,690
Places we've been.

712
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,611
What do you mean?

713
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,286
Beverly?

714
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,086
Beverly?

715
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,406
Beverly?

716
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,486
Beverly.

717
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,040
Bev..

718
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,811
No, no, no.

719
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,291
No. Beverly.

720
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,767
Baby.

721
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,091
This isn't right.

722
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,961
This isn't right.

723
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,891
Beverly. Beverly. Beverly!

724
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,566
Don't leave me.

725
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,446
Please don't go.

726
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,366
I'm sorry.

727
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,171
<i>They spotted him. Otter did.</i>

728
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,289
Peter Lake, I mean. He's back.

729
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,441
Where?

730
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,523
He was at a graveyard in Queens
burying some girl..

731
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,682
then went back to Grand Central
for his horse.

732
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,887
Do they still have him?

733
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,202
Well, that's just the thing.
They can't lose him.

734
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,203
- They're just walking.
- Just walking?

735
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,481
Let's go for a little walk ourselves.

736
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,244
With little Peter Lake.

737
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,561
Shh.

738
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,051
It's all right, horse.

739
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,769
I know they're coming for us.

740
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,206
A fight will do us good.

741
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,010
You failed.

742
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,364
You couldn't save her.
Your beloved red-haired girl.

743
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,046
Ha, ha. Was she gonna be
somebody important?

744
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,929
The president? The pope?

745
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,651
The great-grandmother
of the first man on Mars?

746
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,770
Or was it something simpler?

747
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,684
That she was capable of great love?

748
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,126
The kind of love that makes the world
all warm and light.

749
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,884
And gives the others hope.

750
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,602
The kind of love that tilts the scales.

751
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,890
Well, it doesn't matter.

752
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,607
She's dead.

753
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,163
Cold. Dead.

754
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,845
And already in the ground.

755
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,041
Quit me?

756
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,483
You don't quit me, boy.

757
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,926
I've been blackening souls..

758
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,924
and crushing miracles
for longer than I can remember.

759
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,523
Do you ever ask yourself why
the universe goes to all this trouble..

760
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,969
to help you fulfill your destiny
and then throws me in your path?

761
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,727
Maybe it's because God
is just as bloodthirsty as the rest of us.

762
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,327
Maybe he doesn't like
eternal benevolence and light.

763
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,051
Maybe he just likes a good fight.

764
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,204
I have no idea what you're talking about.
But I'll tell you one thing:

765
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,842
It's a shame your daddy didn't
do a better job on your neck with
that soda bottle.

766
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,525
Is that right, little Peter Lake?

767
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,967
Well, let's see
what we're gonna do with you.

768
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,803
Come on. Move! Move it!

769
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,204
Stop right there!

770
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,002
- Come on, Pete!
- How are you, lads?

771
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,563
- Skin that white dog alive.
- No!

772
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,721
Bring in the net!

773
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,487
- Get him!
- I want you to go.

774
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,081
Horse, go!

775
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,961
Hold, boys.

776
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,481
Horse!

777
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,366
Horse.

778
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,807
Go.

779
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,364
Go.

780
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,801
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

781
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,489
Well, well, well.

782
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,850
Hey, pal.

783
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,288
You looking for someone in particular?

784
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,681
I..

785
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,331
I don't know.

786
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,610
I can't remember.

787
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,889
I can't remember anything.

788
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,802
<i>When true love is lost..</i>

789
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,601
<i>life can bleed of all meaning.</i>

790
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,489
<i>We are left blank.</i>

791
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,450
<i>But the possibility of destiny remains.</i>

792
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,764
<i>What we are meant for
may yet be discovered.</i>

793
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,082
<i>And once in a very long while..</i>

794
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,848
<i>that journey to find our destiny
may defeat even time itself.</i>

795
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,405
Who are you?

796
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,009
Pete, here's your change.

797
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,564
I smashed into you.

798
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,722
You did. Are you all right?

799
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,449
Am I light or heavy?

800
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,161
Light as a feather.

801
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,647
I'm Abby. What's your name?

802
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,486
I don't know.

803
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,404
Everybody knows their name.

804
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,521
Not me.

805
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,330
You're silly.

806
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,961
Look. There's a star.

807
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,843
Even the stars have names.

808
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,081
- What?
- The stars.

809
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,242
I just can't remember them.

810
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,006
Castor.

811
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,564
Abby.

812
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,366
Nice to meet you.

813
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,681
Sorry.

814
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,884
That son of a bitch.

815
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,522
He can't still be alive.

816
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,762
- Romeo, find this man.
- Cesar.

817
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,442
Romeo was my grandfather.

818
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,727
Cesar..

819
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,650
drop everything else.

820
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,445
Find this man.

821
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,283
Boss, this is like a hundred years old.

822
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,726
Do I, uh, strike you as a man
who wouldn't know that?

823
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,810
No, sir. I didn't..

824
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,247
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't..

825
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,922
Remember I told you
howl killed your grandfather?

826
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,561
Sorry, sir.

827
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,006
Find that man.

828
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,847
Find him.

829
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,888
We may have killed the wrong redhead.

830
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,120
Isaac Penn, please.

831
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,248
The woman out front
said he was back here.

832
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,004
This is the Isaac Penn Reading Room.

833
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,561
Yeah, I mean,
I'd like to speak with him if I could.

834
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,045
Be a neat trick.

835
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,404
Peon's been dead 90 years.

836
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,600
Heh. There's a theater on Hudson Street
called the Theater of the Coheeries.

837
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,850
Could you, uh, tell me
if you have any information on it, please?

838
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,650
Isaac Penn donated it.

839
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,723
Nope. I see it here..

840
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,362
but the information on it
hasn't been cataloged from the microfiche.

841
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,807
Okay, might I see them, please?
These micro fish.

842
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,091
Sure. Two forms of ID, fill this out,
two-week approval period..

843
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,368
and you can search
to your heart's delight.

844
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,726
Can I just..? I mean..

845
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,450
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

846
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,728
There's so many regulations these days.

847
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,607
- Hi, I'm Virginia Gamely.
- Hi, Peter Lake.

848
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,171
- Hi.
- Hi.

849
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,850
Do I know you from somewhere?

850
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,923
I don't think so, no. No.

851
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,445
Although I can't be sure.

852
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,330
I've had no memory..

853
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,801
- for as long as I can remember.
- Oh.

854
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,170
Maybe there was once a blow on the head,
although I can't find a scar.

855
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,441
And the whole world has seemed like
a deep fog that's just now beginning
to lift.

856
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,602
Although not fast enough for my liking.

857
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,604
I've become convinced..

858
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,402
that if I could just learn
what this Coheeries is..

859
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,324
it may help jog my memory.

860
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,966
But now they're telling me
I have to wait two weeks..

861
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:40,170
and I have to have two forms of ID that
I don't have just to even get back there.

862
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,767
But I have a growing suspicion that I
may be able to get what I need faster..

863
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,127
as soon as everybody goes home
for the night.

864
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,841
If only I knew what a
micro fish looked like.

865
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,164
You know, places like this
have all sorts of security systems.

866
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,080
Well, somehow I find myself undaunted.

867
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:02,601
Well, you're in luck. I work here,
so I don't need any approvals.

868
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,921
Isn't that right, Jack?

869
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,242
Reporters come and go as they please,
Ms. Gamely.

870
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,289
- There you go.
- I appreciate the help.

871
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,129
I wasn't having any luck anyway.

872
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,645
What were you looking for?

873
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,968
A cure for cancer, I suppose.

874
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,440
So..

875
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,889
this should go..

876
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,201
here.

877
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,286
And..

878
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,325
Aw.

879
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,200
Wait a sec.

880
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,926
Let me see.

881
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,646
Thought you didn't even know
what microfiche were.

882
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,723
I just got a knack with machines.

883
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,761
Try it now.

884
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,409
Well, that's not a theater.

885
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,450
Damn. Guess it's mislabeled.

886
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,049
Coheeries isn't a theater.

887
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,411
It's a town.

888
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,760
Ch..

889
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,690
That's old man Penn.

890
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,009
She played Brahms.

891
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,200
Beverly.

892
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,811
Her name was..

893
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,564
Her name was Beverly.

894
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,520
That's..

895
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,885
It can't be.

896
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,845
Your father?

897
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,770
What's happening here?

898
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,525
She's dead.

899
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,610
She's long gone.

900
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,649
They're all dead a hundred years.

901
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,764
Not all of them.

902
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,041
Yes?
Hi. Um..

903
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,170
My name is Virginia Gamely.
Uh, I work here.

904
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,687
- Yes?
- I write the food column.

905
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,605
- Yes?
- Is she in?

906
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,762
Do you have an appointment
I'm not aware of?

907
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,129
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. I'm glad
we could come to an understanding.

908
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,400
I think I'll have a milkshake
for lunch, Marge.

909
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,244
Do you think Dr. Levi would kill me?

910
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,324
Chocolate with whipped cream.

911
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,931
Ms. Penn?

912
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,327
Willa.

913
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,131
Little Willa.

914
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,965
Peter Lake.

915
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,525
It's right up there.

916
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,130
Where did you find him?

917
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,565
I think he found me.

918
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,722
How is this really possible?

919
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:43,770
Well, in a life this long,
you do see things.

920
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:49,131
Things that don't always add up
to the world we think we know.

921
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,520
<i>Hmm.</i>

922
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,885
I've always held on to that table.

923
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,767
Nothing special, can't say why.

924
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,167
He loved my sister terribly.

925
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,842
She was like a bright light.

926
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,804
How did she die?

927
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,406
Consumption.

928
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,484
The night she died..

929
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,169
The night she died..

930
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,847
I searched the sky for her.

931
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:28,809
And I found her there in Orion's Belt,
I think.

932
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,970
She used to say
that when we finished our work on Earth..

933
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,566
we would fly up and become stars.

934
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,766
What work?

935
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,690
She was 21.

936
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,327
How could she have possibly been finished?

937
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,891
Why am I still alive?

938
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,647
Well, I look at you, Peter,
unchanged after all these years.

939
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,525
Maybe there's something
you are still meant to do.

940
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,081
What?

941
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,604
I have no idea.

942
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,843
May I make you some tea?

943
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,566
Please.

944
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,806
Thank you for bringing me back here.

945
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,646
I have a feeling
we won't see each other again, will we?

946
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,522
It's poor manners to talk back
to your elders.

947
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,329
Technically, I think I'm older than you.

948
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,529
No, I have a feeling we won't.

949
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,004
Goodbye, Peter Lake.

950
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,531
Goodbye, little Willa.

951
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,087
I'm looking forward
to your next recipe, young lady.

952
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,248
I rather like pecans.

953
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,487
I have to pick up my daughter at 3:30.

954
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,361
So, um..

955
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,169
I live down on 12th Street.

956
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,481
I've got a chicken..

957
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,365
if you like chicken.

958
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,764
I would like that, but, um..

959
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,726
- Well, I have a few things I need to..
- Okay.

960
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,130
- Okay.
- Hey.

961
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,211
- Take care.
- Thank you.

962
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,682
Tell the boss that we found him.

963
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,449
How is he still alive?
What are we talking about here, Lu?

964
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:44,446
We're talking about what we are always
talking about: Stars in the sky.

965
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,211
Miracles.

966
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,171
- I stopped him from saving her.
- Pearly.

967
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,491
Not his miracle.

968
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,880
Hers.

969
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,761
What?

970
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,207
You were so fixated on stopping him..

971
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,204
you missed her entirely.

972
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,689
She made him love her so much
that he could not die.

973
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,810
He was her miracle.

974
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,646
I want to kill him,
and I want him to stay dead.

975
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,690
I want him turned into snow
and scattered to the four winds.

976
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,126
Mm.

977
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,489
Older rules would apply.
You would be fighting as a mortal.

978
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,608
That's rather extreme, don't you think?

979
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,646
I'll tell you something
that should chill your blood.

980
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,404
No matter how far
we tip the scales our way..

981
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,131
no matter how many of them
we turn dark..

982
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,245
nothing seems to break
their capacity for hope.

983
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,450
They pass it back and forth
like the flu at a preschool fair.

984
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,890
We're losing, Lucifer.

985
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,881
One bright star at a time, we're losing.

986
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,247
You will have to say the words, Pearly.

987
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,446
Right.

988
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,050
I, Pearly Soames..

989
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,168
Demon Enforcer of the Five Boroughs..

990
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,561
Black Knight of the Armies
of the Fallen..

991
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,486
and faithful and willing servant
to Lucifer, your good self..

992
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,882
hereby request
that the loser of the fight..

993
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,441
between the human, Peter Lake,
and myself..

994
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,729
die the one true death.

995
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,446
Reconsider.

996
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,801
No.

997
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,209
Last chance, Pearly.

998
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,521
Granted.

999
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,801
Pearly.

1000
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,569
Watch out for the starlight.

1001
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,130
What are you talking about, Lu?

1002
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,410
Be careful. I would hate to lose you.

1003
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,361
Why?

1004
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,804
You get used to people.

1005
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,529
Did you try the Brussels sprouts yet?

1006
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,602
I'm not really that hungry, Mom.

1007
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,324
Just try to eat something, baby, okay?

1008
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,481
Okay.

1009
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,801
Here you go.

1010
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,131
- Mama?
- Yes, baby?

1011
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,081
Where do you think we go when we die?

1012
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,526
Come here.

1013
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,521
Hello?

1014
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,126
You said 12th Street, and you're
the only Gamelys on 12th Street.

1015
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,850
And I do like chicken.

1016
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:03,002
- You floated here? In a boat?
- That's what I was told.

1017
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:07,249
We have chocolate, strawberry..

1018
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,209
and pistachio.

1019
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,931
Pistachio. Pistachio?

1020
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,969
- She hates vanilla.
- I hate vanilla.

1021
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,761
Mama.

1022
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,601
Lay her down.

1023
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,607
Hey, baby. All right.

1024
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,650
Relax. Relax, relax. Mama's here.

1025
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,326
It's all right. It's all right, darling.
Mama's here.

1026
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,649
She gets seizures.

1027
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,970
She'll sleep now.

1028
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,809
Abby has red hair.

1029
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,690
We have to go. Now.

1030
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,722
No. There's nowhere to go.

1031
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,405
The girl in the pictures..

1032
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,370
the girl I've been drawing..

1033
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,891
it was her all along.

1034
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,485
She has cancer, Peter.

1035
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,329
Her doctors say she's dying.

1036
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,724
I think I know how to save her.

1037
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,445
They said only a miracle.

1038
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,286
Me.

1039
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,484
That's why I stayed alive.

1040
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,846
For her.

1041
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,970
I'm her miracle.

1042
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,445
This is crazy.

1043
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,841
I can save her. I know I can.

1044
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,241
We have to go.

1045
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,882
There are men coming who mean to harm me.
I think they mean to harm Abby too.

1046
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,565
Trust me, please.

1047
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,411
There's a horse on the roof.

1048
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,240
There is.

1049
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,010
Hello, my old friend.

1050
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,486
It's been a very long time.

1051
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,569
Here. Give her to me.

1052
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,361
Come on.

1053
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,650
- You know where to go, horse.
- What?

1054
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,609
Shh. Let him do the math.

1055
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,201
Okay.

1056
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,248
- How is she?
- Still sleeping.

1057
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,966
Hey.

1058
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,891
Coheeries.

1059
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,965
It looks forgotten.

1060
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,360
Come on, this way.

1061
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,964
What about those, uh..?
Whoever they were. Christ.

1062
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,527
I don't think they can follow us up here.

1063
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:37,047
You don't think. That's reassuring.

1064
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,089
No, I'm fairly sure.

1065
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,525
Rules change.

1066
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,081
Little Peter wants to save someone.

1067
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,969
But I want to fight.

1068
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,290
Good to see you, Peter.

1069
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,402
In fairness, I can't say
the same thing about you, Pearly.

1070
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:21,769
Well, it seems I got my redheads mixed up.

1071
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,891
Honest mistake.

1072
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,326
I'll fix it.

1073
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,004
There's 20 of us.

1074
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,450
And there's just the one of you.

1075
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,969
There'll be no miracles tonight.

1076
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:37,569
And her destiny is getting skewered.

1077
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,766
Horse.

1078
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,523
I suppose you know what to do, horse.

1079
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,761
Always a coward, that White Dog!

1080
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,046
Boys.

1081
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,489
Why do you do it, Pearly?

1082
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,371
Do you even know?

1083
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,609
I know my destiny.

1084
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,207
And it's high time you met yours.

1085
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,121
Off the ice!

1086
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,487
Right, then.

1087
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,481
Abby?

1088
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,761
Abby.

1089
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,490
Oh, Jesus. No.

1090
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,201
A bed of wishes made 100 years ago
by a little girl who's now an old woman.

1091
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:32,081
A bed made to save a girl with flaming
red hair from dying too young.

1092
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,724
A place made for a miracle.

1093
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,209
Now, I'm just a mechanic,
but what are we if not machines?

1094
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,804
Machines that need a little help
from the universe to run.

1095
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,201
Abby.

1096
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,763
Is this why we love at all?

1097
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,566
To save?

1098
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:03,202
You were always the one, weren't you?

1099
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,684
Please, you were always the one
I was meant to save.

1100
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,440
Come back.

1101
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,290
Please come back.

1102
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,046
No.

1103
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,686
Mama?

1104
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:14,841
Why is everybody crying?

1105
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,881
Did I get sick and pass out again?

1106
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,451
Yes, Abby.

1107
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,210
But you're better now.

1108
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,528
<i>Why would so many things
conspire to save one little girl's life?</i>

1109
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,927
<i>But what if it wasn't just Abby?</i>

1110
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:02,404
<i>What if she is no more or less special
than any of us?</i>

1111
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,204
<i>What if we are all unique..</i>

1112
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,170
<i>and the universe loves us all equally?</i>

1113
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:12,287
<i>So much so that it bends over backwards
across the centuries..</i>

1114
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,562
<i>for each and every one of us.</i>

1115
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:18,721
<i>And sometimes,
we are just lucky enough to see it.</i>

1116
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,770
<i>No life is more important than another.</i>

1117
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,602
<i>And nothing has been without purpose.</i>

1118
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:32,886
<i>Nothing.</i>

1119
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:38,282
<i>What if we are all part of a great pattern
that we may someday understand?</i>

1120
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:48,004
<i>And one day, when we have done
what we alone are capable of doing..</i>

1121
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:52,770
<i>we get to rise up and reunite
with those we have loved the most..</i>

1122
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,080
<i>forever embraced.</i>

1123
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,964
<i>What if we get to become stars?</i>

1124
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
