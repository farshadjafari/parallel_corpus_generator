1
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,178
'What the fuck? '

2
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,891
Fucking touch it,
I'll fucking kill you!

3
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,983
Fucking wankers!

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,778
You want it?

5
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,822
Fucking cunts! Fucking money!
My fucking money!

6
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,914
Fucking cunts!

7
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,202
I'll fucking tear yous apart
by your fucking throats!

8
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,210
Cunts! They take your fucking money!

9
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,089
Come on, you!

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,547
Shut the fuck up!

11
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,885
Oh, fuck.

12
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,478
- I've got a present for you.
- Oh, yeah?

13
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:22,108
Home-made. Covert.
In fact, I've got it on me just now.

14
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,401
Could be in my shoe.

15
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,529
Might go off at any minute.

16
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,664
Can you hear it?

17
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,456
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

18
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:38,457
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Boom!

19
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,962
Look, do you want your money,
or shall I call the police?

20
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,634
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,762
You keep coming here,
giving me your shit, mate.

22
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,599
No, don't... Don't phone the police.

23
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,601
I'm sorry. Just...

24
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,645
Give me the money, please.

25
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,412
Don't come here again, OK?

26
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,421
OK.

27
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,388
Right, I'll tell you what,
if you miss this shot,

28
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,223
you've got to suck my dick.

29
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,809
You're going to get my dick,
and go...

30
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,107
And I want you humming on my balls.
And then I want...

31
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,476
You can suck this dick, mate.

32
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,819
I'll suck your dick!
Give it here!

33
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,950
Will you shut the fuck up?
Shut the fuck up!

34
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,165
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- Nowt, mate. Just a private joke.

35
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,706
Well, do you want to share it?
Wanna give me a fucking laugh?

36
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,330
- Not really.
- Right, well, fuck up then!

37
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,717
- Doing my fucking head in!
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

38
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,259
- Leave it, Dan.
- Watch. Oi, what you staring at?

39
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,594
Hey, what the fuck you staring at?

40
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,560
Want this pool cue
wrapped round your fucking head?

41
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,475
Fucking answer me!

42
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,191
Do you want this pool cue
wrapped round your fucking head?

43
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,775
- No.
- Right, then.

44
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,271
Well, drink your drink, and
keep your fucking nose out. Prick!

45
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,066
Dan, watch it!

46
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,282
- Do you think I'm fucking a poof?
- No.

47
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,626
- Do you think I'm a fucking poof?
- No.

48
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,746
- Want to suck my cock?
- No. We've just come in for a drink.

49
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,544
- You want to suck my cock?
- No!

50
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,634
- Suck this!
- I don't know why you're doing this!

51
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,068
Hello?

52
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,285
Are you all right in there?

53
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,543
Are you hiding from somebody?

54
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,214
- Can I move this rail?
- No!

55
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,050
OK.

56
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,512
I can't just leave you there, though.

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,854
What's your name?

58
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,777
Robert De Niro.

59
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,360
Would you like a cup of tea?

60
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,289
Fuck off.

61
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,839
Would you like me
to pray for you, Robert?

62
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,788
Father, God, I'm asking you now
to touch this man,

63
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,911
and to reach into his heart.

64
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,958
He's in pain, Lord.

65
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,630
I believe you've brought him to me
to help him find his way.

66
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,716
He seems lost, Lord.

67
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,269
Give him the strength to find a way.

68
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,896
And let him know
that whatever is troubling him,

69
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:34,192
he can confide in you
and ask for your forgiveness.

70
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,322
OK.

71
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,153
All right.

72
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,637
Do you feel better now?

73
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,856
Bye.

74
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,381
- What you doing out at this time?
- Waiting for my mum.

75
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,426
Has she gone out
and left you out here?

76
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,474
No. She's in with her boyfriend.

77
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,269
Where's Bluey?

78
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,151
He died, son.

79
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,816
How?

80
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,568
Got run over.

81
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,742
Are you sad?

82
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,829
Yep.

83
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,699
Are you gonna kill the man
that did it?

84
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,294
It was a hit-and-run.
They never caught the guy.

85
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:18,383
- It's a shame. I liked that dog.
- Yeah, me too.

86
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,213
- Why did he sleep in the shed?
- Wife didn't like him in the house.

87
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:29,265
Your wife's dead. Could've put him in
the house. She wouldn't have known.

88
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,853
Old habits.

89
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,268
Sam. In. Now!

90
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,905
- Night, son.
- Night, Joseph.

91
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,906
All right, fucko!

92
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,782
Hey, he's not gonna bite you.
He's just gonna fucking eat you!

93
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,161
What you looking at, you old cunt?

94
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,932
Hello.

95
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,597
Sorry.

96
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,224
You're on my shutters.
Just I need to open up.

97
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,400
Do you want to come in?

98
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,529
I'll open up.

99
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,247
Here you go.

100
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,642
So, what happened to you?

101
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,054
Fell off my bike.

102
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,648
OK. Well, you look like
you need to go to the hospital.

103
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,731
Nah. I'll heal myself.

104
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,115
I prayed for you last night.

105
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,160
Yeah, well, it didn't fucking work.

106
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,032
I think it did.

107
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,251
Don't think he heard you, love.

108
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,796
Why did you come here?

109
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,758
I was just passing.

110
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:35,056
There must be a reason. Do you want
God to forgive you for something?

111
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,808
I don't want anything from that fuck.

112
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,811
- God loves you.
- Does he now?

113
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,154
You're a child of God.

114
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,649
God ain't my fucking daddy.

115
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,778
My daddy was a cunt,
but he knew he was a cunt.

116
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,701
God still thinks he's God.
Nobody's told him otherwise.

117
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,997
- Why are you so angry at God?
- Why are you so fucking stupid?

118
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,920
I've met people like you
all my fucking life.

119
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,210
Goodie goodies.

120
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,550
Make a charity record.

121
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,796
Bake a cake. Save a fucking soul!

122
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,888
You've never eaten shit.

123
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,762
Don't know what it's like out there.
You haven't a clue!

124
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,850
- Where do you live?
- What?

125
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,320
I asked you where you lived.
Simple fucking question. You deaf?

126
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,198
Manors Estate.

127
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,864
Manors fucking Estate!

128
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,744
How is Manors Estate?

129
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,620
How are the five-bedroomed,
double-garaged, nicely trimmed lawn,

130
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,669
fondue, coffee-morning
fucking lifestyle Manors Estate?

131
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,713
How is it up there? Swimming, is it?

132
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,302
What the fuck
are you doing down here, huh?

133
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,555
What are you doing
running this shop?

134
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,303
You're a young woman.
You have a family? Got kids?

135
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,394
No. We can't have them.

136
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,063
Can't or won't?

137
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,949
This fills a gap, doesn't it?

138
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,615
You reckon you do enough good deeds,
God's gonna fix your insides?

139
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,240
Please.

140
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,918
Or is your man a jaffa?

141
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,313
Thanks for the tea.

142
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,945
I'll pray for you.

143
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,176
What the fuck is wrong with you?

144
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,938
I'm a fucking arse.

145
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,860
You're a fucking...

146
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,153
You all right, Joseph?

147
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,822
Yeah, I'm all right.

148
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,350
Ready? Woo!

149
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,317
Hannah?

150
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,621
Hannah.

151
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,246
Hannah.

152
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,038
Hannah!

153
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,459
Hannah!

154
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,627
- Why didn't you come to bed?
- I conked out on the sofa.

155
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,134
- Well, come up now, then.
- I'm all cleaned up now.

156
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,597
- Get dirty again.
- Don't. I've lots to do before work.

157
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,590
- It's not work.
- Don't!

158
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,066
Well, I'll go and have a wank, then.

159
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,260
Hi, Joseph.

160
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,879
Cheers.

161
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,628
When you were wee, me and your dad
used to take you to the...

162
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,810
What you saying?

163
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,359
I'm fucked.

164
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,233
I've fucked it.

165
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,702
- Marie hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.

166
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,536
Aye, she does. She hates me.

167
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,783
She loves you. She loves you, man.
We all love you.

168
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,875
I'm going to hell, Joseph.

169
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,837
- No, no, no, no.
- I am.

170
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:32,260
- Done some bad things.
- We've all done bad things, mate.

171
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,879
Aye. Aye, but...

172
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,567
- Do you want a hand?
- No, it's OK.

173
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,386
Listen, sweetheart,
I came to say...

174
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,051
My name is Hannah.

175
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,473
I wanted to say that
I'm sorry for yesterday.

176
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,813
Some of the things I said.
It got personal.

177
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,852
Shall we just get out of this place?

178
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,632
So, is that not
against your religion?

179
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,976
- The lager thing?
- Supposedly.

180
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,388
I won't tell the big man.

181
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,600
So this is your world.

182
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,153
Pretty much.

183
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,986
What about your family?

184
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,203
- Not got any.
- There must be somebody.

185
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,787
Nope. Best friend's dying of cancer.

186
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,001
I killed my dog. So I'm fucked.

187
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,121
You killed your dog?

188
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,420
Kicked his ribs in. My buddy.

189
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,963
Why kick your buddy?

190
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,635
Some cunt annoyed me in the bookies.
Came out, took it out on him.

191
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,554
My Bluey.

192
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,233
Joseph, what's the story
in Balamory?

193
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,817
All right, Tommy.

194
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:42,654
Listen, I heard what you done
to those Pakis.

195
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,492
And what they done to you.

196
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,659
We are, as we speak,
getting a mob together

197
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,622
to ku-klux-klan the bastards.

198
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,662
I fight my own battles, Tommy.

199
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:56,164
It's not just you they've offended.
They have also offended me.

200
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,794
The way they fucking leer at you.
I've got a pig's head.

201
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,547
- I'm gonna post it to the bastards.
- Fucking leave it. Let it go.

202
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,345
No, them pack animals,
they stick together.

203
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,061
And us Celts, we've got
to stick together too, yeah?

204
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,273
If a baby was on fire,
they wouldn't piss on it.

205
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,141
A white baby, that is.

206
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,860
And yet, correct me if I'm wrong,

207
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,651
but we're doing all this
for their fucking kids

208
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,775
with their tsunamis, monsoons
and what have you,

209
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,652
natural fucking disasters!

210
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,653
Am I right, or am I right, huh?

211
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,412
- You going to the bookies later?
- Aye.

212
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,751
- Yeah?
- An accumulator.

213
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,130
If they all come in,
I'm gonna be a very rich man!

214
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,379
Gonna buy myself a zoo.

215
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,970
That's my fucking thing.
I love fucking animals, yeah?

216
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,182
I'd fill the place
with exotic creatures, yeah?

217
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,472
Like off the Blue Planet.

218
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,438
Not your fucking
run-of-the-mill common or garden,

219
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,227
or fucking diddly fucking zoo.

220
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,980
No way. There'd be a lion,
a tiger and a pink panther.

221
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,942
He knows! A pink fucking panther!

222
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,196
- Can I buy yous a drink?
- No.

223
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,700
- An advance on me future fortune.
- No, we'll finish this and go.

224
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,961
Sorry. Did he offend you?

225
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,638
You offended me more.

226
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,681
I've got to go.

227
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,770
Would you do me a favour?

228
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,852
I pray, Father, God, that you
take this man's soul into your hands,

229
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,775
and be at his side.

230
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,201
Be his guide, Lord.
Embrace him with your love.

231
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,696
Take away his fear of the unknown,
Lord, and embrace him.

232
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,831
Let him know
he need not fear anything, Lord.

233
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,831
Life is just a part of existence
and death is eternal.

234
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:07,007
Lord, I ask in your wisdom,
if you see fit to intervene,

235
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,098
then help this man
on the road to recovery, Lord.

236
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,514
Lord, we know
you see the bigger picture.

237
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:19,686
If, Lord, you think it's his time,
then we just ask you to embrace him.

238
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,731
Welcome him with love...

239
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,099
- Hey there!
- Hi. What you doing?

240
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,470
Getting a drink and thinking
about getting something to eat.

241
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,313
- Have you eaten?
- Yeah.

242
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,228
OK. I'll get something light...

243
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,444
I came by your shop today.

244
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,818
And you wasn't there.

245
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,818
No. My friend's husband's dying,
so she asked me to pray for him.

246
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,409
Couldn't you pray in the shop?

247
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,578
Yeah, but he's only got a couple of days,
and she was upset,

248
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,997
so she wanted me
to be in the room with him.

249
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,333
You were spotted with a man.

250
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,802
What? That's rubbish!
Who'd make up that?

251
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,842
- Family fortunes.
- What?

252
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,847
The wheel of fortunes.

253
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,899
Are you on something?

254
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,908
- You don't dance with me any more.
- You should take me out, then.

255
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,824
You don't fuck me any more.

256
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,947
James.

257
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,125
Do I smell like a dead animal?

258
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,003
What?

259
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,248
You fuck like a dead animal.

260
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,466
What do you want me to say to that?

261
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,231
Joseph, what you doing, man?

262
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,904
Knocking down the shed.

263
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,572
- Why, son?
- It reminds me of Bluey.

264
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,993
- That's a nice thing, man.
- It's all the bad things, son.

265
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,039
All the stuff that's gonna rot
in my fucking head!

266
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,666
Oi, fuckhead.

267
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,168
Do you want to keep
the fucking noise down?

268
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,927
Fucko, I'll stick that thing
up your fucking arse!

269
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,846
Right, you fucker!

270
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,111
Oi, silly cunt!

271
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,079
Samuel, get away from there!

272
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,454
Can you not fucking hear me, hey?

273
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,372
I told you to stop making a racket!

274
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,871
Banging that shed
like Captain fucking Caveman!

275
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:34,968
Man, do that once more, and I swear
I'll let this fucker off the leash!

276
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,337
It'll rip your fucking throat out!

277
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,939
- He's a beautiful dog.
- Aye.

278
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,239
You won't be saying that when
he's hanging off your fucking face!

279
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,738
It's not your fault, buddy.

280
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,159
It's not your fault.

281
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,171
There's a good boy!

282
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,643
You fucking pussy!

283
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,183
Sam, I've told you!

284
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,853
You, stay away
from that weird bastard!

285
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,442
I fucking told you!

286
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,405
- Get in there.
- Hurry up.

287
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,574
Get in!

288
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,535
There's these fresh lovely flowers
that they planted in the park.

289
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,205
Some sort of mural they were making.

290
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,330
Welcome to Buckingham.
Fuckingham!

291
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:59,135
Welcome to Fuckingham Palace.
It was for the Queen's visit, yeah?

292
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,676
The thing is, Joseph,

293
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,346
they stopped the fucking buses
on account of that cow.

294
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:10,017
That's my mode of transportation.
My A to fucking B.

295
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,892
I missed Superman because of her.

296
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:16,486
My little boy is crying his eyes out.
I promised him the Man of Steel.

297
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,028
He says to me, "Fuck the Queen.
I want to see Superman.

298
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,492
"I want to see the Man of Steel."

299
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,205
"Fuck the Queen," says he.
My own boy. Paddy.

300
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,037
Fuck the Queen!
I nearly would at this stage.

301
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,207
Jesus Christ!
It's an awful state of affairs.

302
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,672
It's dog all together.

303
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,713
It's dog.

304
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,468
- Good night!
- Bye, mate.

305
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,308
Don't say good night to me
whatever you do.

306
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,736
Freedom!

307
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,698
Good night, Joseph,
you fucking bastard.

308
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,917
Oi, you cunts! I'm here!

309
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,452
What happened to you?

310
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,831
I fell over. I forgot to put
the mat down in the bath.

311
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,179
Sorry. Did you want to say something?

312
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:52,676
- I thought I might say something.
- What?

313
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,891
Doesn't matter.

314
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,266
What, you haven't come to rage at me?
Swear at me? Depress me?

315
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,519
Question my beliefs?
Make assumptions about my cosy life?

316
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,989
- No.
- Well, that's kind of you. Bye.

317
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,076
- Morning!
- Hi!

318
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,792
Hey! Hello!

319
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,287
Oh, Hannah love,
what happened to you?

320
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,038
I slipped over in the bath.

321
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,961
Oh, silly you! It looks sore.

322
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,551
It is. It is sore.
But it looks worse than it is.

323
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,968
- You need a bath mat, love.
- Good idea!

324
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,718
- Adults in here. Kids in here.
- Brilliant. Thank you so much.

325
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,391
- You take care.
- Yes, I will. I promise.

326
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,309
- See you soon.
- Lovely to see you.

327
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,557
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

328
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,969
He's gone, Joseph.

329
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,374
Joseph!

330
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,703
Please, Joseph!
He'll get the dog on you!

331
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,128
Joseph!
He'll get the dog on you, man!

332
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,759
Please!

333
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,969
Look, I know you're sad,
but, please! He'll kill us both!

334
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,121
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hannah.

335
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,546
I don't know what happened to me.

336
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,260
I don't know what's wrong with me.

337
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,139
I'm ill, Hannah.

338
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,482
I don't deserve you.

339
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,523
It's OK. It's OK.
I'm here for you. I forgive you.

340
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,194
I pray to God,
but he doesn't hear me.

341
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:21,444
- It's OK.
- And I can't take it any more.

342
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,947
It's OK. I'm here for you.

343
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:31,292
I'll keep praying... Hannah.

344
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:35,793
I'll just keep praying...
because it's not the real me.

345
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:39,386
- It's not. It's not the real you.
- Do you remember the real me?

346
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,803
Yeah, I remember the real you.
It's OK. I pray for you.

347
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,551
- I'll pray for you, James.
- You'll pray for me?

348
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,681
I don't deserve you.

349
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:54,231
- And I do love you so much.
- It's OK. I'm here for you. It's OK.

350
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,604
- I don't deserve you.
- It's OK.

351
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,371
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

352
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,284
I love you.

353
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,545
I love you.

354
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,797
It's OK.

355
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,819
My friend died yesterday.

356
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

357
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,996
- I miss the cunt.
- I'm sure he misses you too.

358
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,706
Who hit you?

359
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,839
I had a fall.

360
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,844
Anyway, I need a suit
for the funeral.

361
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,228
Wondered if you had something
that might fit.

362
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,102
Yeah, we've got a couple of suits
you can give a go.

363
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,071
- What do you think?
- It looks very smart.

364
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,913
Aye?

365
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,374
Trousers are a bit big, but fuck it.

366
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,582
- Can I use your mirror?
- Yeah.

367
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,004
Oh, aye?
Still a handsome bastard.

368
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,301
You are.
This will finish it off nicely...

369
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,095
- Hey.
- Sorry.

370
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,313
No, I'm... I'm sorry. Go ahead.

371
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,603
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Right.

372
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,624
Hey!

373
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,886
Hi, Hannah.

374
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,425
Hey.

375
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,799
- How's your day?
- Yeah, good.

376
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,520
This is Joseph. His friend's died.
I'm helping him to get a suit.

377
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,138
Sorry to hear that.

378
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,817
Yeah, when was the funeral, Joseph?

379
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,647
- Wednesday, I think.
- Well, you'd better make sure.

380
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,151
Don't want to turn up
on the wrong day!

381
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,037
- I'll change in there, eh?
- Yeah. Great.

382
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,838
Hey, how was your morning? What?

383
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,882
- I saw you.
- You saw me what?

384
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,144
- What does that mean?
- I'll talk to you later.

385
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,265
You fucking slag!

386
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,893
I haven't done anything.
It's not like that.

387
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,241
You OK?

388
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,536
Yeah. Sorry.
Could you leave, please?

389
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:04,936
What are you fucking looking at?
Fuck you!

390
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,505
'Hello. Neither I nor James can
come to the phone right now.

391
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,127
'Please leave a message.'

392
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:35,054
James, I didn't do anything.
Please pick up the phone.

393
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,051
Can I get a gin and tonic, please?

394
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:46,773
'Hello. Neither I nor James... '

395
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:50,740
James, it's Hannah. Please listen.
I didn't do anything wrong.

396
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,404
It's not what you think.

397
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,465
James, it's Hannah.
Please pick up the phone.

398
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:13,054
I want to explain to you.
Please pick up the phone!

399
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,468
Pick up the phone.

400
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,092
'Hello? Hello? '

401
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,470
Please don't hurt me any more,
James.

402
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,222
'Where are you? Hannah? '

403
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,150
I don't want you to hurt me any more.

404
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,442
'Are you drunk? Where are you?
Tell me where you are.'

405
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,029
Don't hurt me any more.

406
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,449
'Hannah? Hannah? '

407
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,368
- Hello?
- 'You with my wife? Where are you? '

408
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:47,918
We're just at the...
We're just at the Exchange now.

409
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,506
Yeah. She's on the floor.

410
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:53,298
Come on.
You'll get piles sitting there!

411
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,756
- That's it.
- Come on.

412
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,680
There we are.

413
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:10,695
- Hey, that looks posh.
- Do you think he'll give us a lift?

414
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,275
- He's here now.
- You go home.

415
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,447
You'll be home soon.

416
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,038
You'll be home soon. Hi!

417
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,623
- Thank you.
- Hiya.

418
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,709
- She's good.
- Bye, love.

419
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,170
- See ya.
- It's OK. All right.

420
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,679
Watch your head.

421
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,345
I'm going to stick you!
You fucking slag!

422
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,023
What's so funny?

423
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,814
- You been out selling your fanny?
- Yeah.

424
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,024
- What?
- Yeah, I've been selling my fanny.

425
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:43,037
I need all the men I can fuck,
because you're a useless bastard.

426
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,622
And I can't stand
the sight of you any more.

427
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,662
You're a little fucking coward!

428
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:50,377
Pretends he believes in God
and is ill in the head.

429
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,919
You're an evil little boy with
an evil little cock. Go on! Hit me!

430
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,009
Go on! Right on the chin!
Bruise me up some more!

431
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,378
Bruise my whole fucking head!
Come on!

432
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,427
Want to smell my fanny?
You normally do, don't you?

433
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,429
I fucking hate you! Get off me!
I fucking hate you!

434
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,306
Hate you!

435
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,116
Evil little cock, huh?
Evil little cock, hey?

436
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:07,034
How about I just slice your tits off
and stick them on the wall, hey?

437
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:11,284
I gave you a chance, Hannah.
I gave you a fucking chance!

438
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,332
I gave you a chance
and you fucked it up!

439
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,967
Do you want some little cock, hey?
Do you want some fucking cock?

440
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,644
- Can I help you, love?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Joseph.

441
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,228
Joseph?

442
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,144
Yes, I came here with him
to pray for your father.

443
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,649
Erm... come in.

444
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,950
Where is he now?

445
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,993
I've left him.

446
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:21,297
You have any family or friends
or someone you can go to?

447
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,462
They won't believe me.

448
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,965
They think he's perfect.

449
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:33,638
I'd say there was enough evidence
on your face to suggest otherwise.

450
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,018
I don't have anybody.

451
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,319
Marie...

452
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,864
What do I do with her?

453
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,123
Does it bring back memories, Joseph?

454
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,402
- All right, Sam?
- Where have you been, man?

455
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,241
I've been around, son.

456
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,031
Is this your girlfriend?

457
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:38,164
- This is Hannah.
- Whoa! What happened to you, girl?

458
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,158
Would you believe,
she fell off a bus.

459
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,875
- What? From top?
- Aye.

460
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,749
Oh, that's bad luck.

461
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,591
I hope she's all right.

462
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,053
- See ya.
- See ya, fella.

463
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,560
Come on through.

464
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,064
Grab a seat.

465
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,575
Can I get you something?

466
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,457
- Do you have any aspirin?
- Yeah.

467
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:25,000
I can get you something stronger,
but it might knock you out.

468
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,588
Aspirin would be great.

469
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,799
- Want a tea?
- Yes, please.

470
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,963
- What do you take?
- Just milk.

471
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,730
- Just milk, yeah?
- Yes, please.

472
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,960
Who's the woman in the picture there?

473
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:13,131
- That's the wife.
- She's got a lovely face.

474
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,634
Yeah. She did have.

475
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,633
She was a good woman.

476
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,511
She's dead, is she?

477
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,138
Five years now.

478
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,775
How did she die?
If it's all right to ask.

479
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,519
Sorry, I'm prying.

480
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,692
Heart attack.

481
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,655
She was diabetic.

482
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,536
She was always a big girl,

483
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,828
but she would not stop
eating the shit that was killing her.

484
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,789
In the end, they cut off her legs.

485
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,834
She was fucking blind.
She was just a carcass.

486
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,513
The Tyrannosaur.

487
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,467
Sorry. What did you say?

488
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,936
Fucking dogs
are driving me fucking nuts!

489
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:08,228
Can you hear that barking?
It's fucking killing me!

490
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,941
What are you doing?

491
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,727
Oh, sorry!

492
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,710
Morning.

493
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,635
- You can't stay here.
- OK.

494
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:06,179
I can't cope.
Can't cope with someone in the house.

495
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:12,398
You brought your shite to my door
and I don't want it. I'm no Samaritan.

496
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,016
Right.

497
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,858
It's nothing personal.

498
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,320
I'm trying to turn my life around
and you're fucking it up.

499
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,941
Now, if you want help to go and get
some gear, then I'll help you.

500
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,615
But if your old man's gonna
keep bartering the fuck out of you,

501
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,204
go to family or friends
or your Christian buddies.

502
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:32,201
- You've no business with me.
- I understand.

503
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,079
I'll take you home
and I'll help you get some gear.

504
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,331
After that, we're done.

505
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,586
Yeah.

506
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,573
Is it this one?

507
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,862
- Right, come on.
- Erm...

508
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,784
- Hannah, come on.
- I'm not ready.

509
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,626
- I'm not ready.
- It's OK.

510
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,121
- Look, I'll go in. I'll sort it.
- No, I can't!

511
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,249
- Hannah, I'll sort it.
- No.

512
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,797
- Come on. Hannah!
- No!

513
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,057
Hannah!

514
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,298
- How's it going?
- How did you get on?

515
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,385
- I think I did OK, Captain.
- Superb.

516
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,003
How much do I owe you?

517
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,722
Do I look like the Chancellor
of the fucking Exchequer?

518
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,809
There's no fucking way!
I help my buddy, yeah?

519
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,974
And the lady? Damsel in distress.

520
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,939
OK, you're a good man.
You're a good man. I'll see you.

521
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,980
OK, what we got?

522
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,977
- Shirt.
- Great.

523
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,820
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

524
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,611
These are all clean.

525
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:30,986
Yeah. Jeans. Your size?

526
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,578
- Hm.
- OK. Good.

527
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,868
I could have bought them myself.
I have some money.

528
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,992
No, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine.

529
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,119
Here. Summery, eh?

530
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,212
Hair. Is that hair?

531
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,085
- Hair bands.
- Hair bands.

532
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:49,884
- I don't really have hair.
- OK. What else we got?

533
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,426
Ah, he's a fucking wank... Sorry.
It's Tommy.

534
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,974
His idea of a joke. Sorry, sorry.

535
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,854
Ah, fuck.

536
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,441
You all right?

537
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,484
I've got to go
to my friend's funeral tomorrow.

538
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:17,749
Thank you.

539
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,655
What you doing stood way over here?

540
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,787
Thought I'd stay out the way.

541
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,533
A pity you couldn't have done that
a few years ago.

542
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,544
It's not your fault, Joseph.

543
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:15,174
Dad had a mind of his own, you know.
You just didn't fucking help matters.

544
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,602
Will you come for a drink with me?

545
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:24,683
- No.
- Yes, you fucking will.

546
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,810
# Easy and free

547
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,564
# When you're drinking with me

548
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:35,865
# I'm a man you don't meet every day

549
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:39,330
# So I took out my dog

550
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:42,121
# And him I did shoot

551
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:46,872
# Down in the County Kildare

552
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,466
# So be easy and free

553
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,007
# When you're drinking with me

554
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:58,683
# I'm a man
you don't meet every day #

555
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:08,356
Well, we don't want to sit around
going boo-hoo-hoo all day.

556
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,321
Are we going to give Jack
a proper send-off or what?

557
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,821
# Hey, Jack, who ran away

558
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,287
# We miss you, we want you back

559
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,204
# You don't just touch our hearts

560
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,452
# Oh, no, you steal 'em

561
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,379
# You were all right,
you came for the night

562
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,345
# And you loved, you loved to fight

563
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,681
# And you don't just shake our hands

564
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,766
# Oh, no, you feel 'em

565
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:48,692
# So do a little something
like call my name

566
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,356
# Jack, I want you back

567
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:55,949
# So do a little something
like call my name

568
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,193
# See your soon, Jack

569
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,366
# Show me love

570
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,364
# I'll do the same #

571
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,395
# Mary loves the Grouse

572
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,811
# Hides the bottles round the house

573
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,185
# She watches chat shows
and the soaps

574
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,819
# Broken-hearted but she copes

575
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:40,193
# Michael's out of work

576
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,663
# Feels he's sinking in the murk

577
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,409
# He's unshaven and a mess

578
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,753
# Finds it hard some days to dress

579
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,586
# Stevie smashed the delf

580
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,303
# Cos he can't express himself

581
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:02,299
# He's consumed by rage

582
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,347
# Like his father at his age

583
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,306
# Rita's little child

584
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,809
# Has a lovely little smile

585
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:16,905
# But this means nothing
to her father

586
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,150
# Because he's never even seen her

587
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:24,154
# We sing

588
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:30,661
# Sing all our cares away

589
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:35,878
# We'll live

590
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:42,381
# To fight another day

591
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:46,931
# Yeah, we sing

592
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:53,184
# Sing all our cares away

593
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:57,858
# Yeah, we'll live

594
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:05,033
# To love another day

595
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:16,131
# We grow strong from it all

596
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:19,717
# We grow strong

597
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,304
# Or we fall

598
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:28,427
# We grow strong #

599
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,526
Mum!

600
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,785
Mum, they stole my bunny!

601
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:59,541
Sam! Come here in here! Sam!
Sam, come in here now!

602
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,134
I'm going to kill you!

603
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,426
I hate you, Bod!
You're a fucking bastard!

604
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,924
Give me him!
My dad gave me him!

605
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,768
I'm going to kill you!

606
01:09:58,486 --> 01:09:59,896
Hannah.

607
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,519
It's OK. Sorry.

608
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:05,194
- OK? Sorry.
- It's all right.

609
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,484
It's 11 o'clock.

610
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,951
- You want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

611
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,870
How's your head?

612
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,744
It's not great. I'll survive.

613
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:20,789
- Just milk?
- Mm. Yes, please.

614
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:53,621
- We'll fix it or get you another.
- He's my bunny. I want to keep it.

615
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,914
Sam, I'm sorry.

616
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,002
Why Tyrannosaur?

617
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,208
What?

618
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:08,552
About your wife.
Tyrannosaurus or something?

619
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,974
Oh, Tyranno... Right, yeah.

620
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:19,814
It was...
It was just a joke. A joke name.

621
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:24,148
Seen 'Jurassic Park'?
You know, the movie?

622
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,862
Do you remember
there's a scene in the car,

623
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:30,108
the kids are scared
and they're looking at the glass

624
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,451
and you hear the Tyrannosaur coming?

625
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:36,869
As it thumps its way towards them,
the glass starts to ripple.

626
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:44,715
So, my wife was a big lady.
You'd hear her going up the stairs.

627
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,800
And it was like
boom, boom, boom, boom.

628
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:50,636
And I swear if I put a cup of tea
on the sideboard,

629
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:54,349
you'd see the same ripples in my tea.

630
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,513
So I called her the Tyrannosaur.

631
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,478
I thought it was funny.

632
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,306
I was being a cunt.

633
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,313
- Did you love her?
- Mm-hm.

634
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,150
And I hated her as well.

635
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,950
She was a simple lady.

636
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,284
Had this naive faith in people.

637
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,964
Would forgive anyone for anything.
Used to drive me fucking nuts.

638
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:31,253
So full of forgiveness and love...

639
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,514
And I stomped the love out of her.

640
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,265
I'm not proud of it.

641
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:46,233
I thought she was dumb.

642
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,569
But she wasn't. She was beautiful.

643
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,785
- Do you wish she was still here now?
- No.

644
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,581
- I'd still treat her like a dog.
- Why?

645
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,994
Cos I'm not a nice human being.

646
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,841
I don't agree.
I think you're a good person.

647
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,052
You don't know anything, girl.

648
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,670
I feel safe with you.

649
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,093
Nobody's safe with me.

650
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,821
Hey there! How you doing?
Hope you don't mind.

651
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,535
I wanted to cook something for you

652
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,531
to say thank you
for looking after me.

653
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,663
And, erm, I've got something in here.

654
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:16,230
Just to brighten the place up a bit
and to say thank you.

655
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,483
Are you OK?

656
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:26,240
Sorry. I didn't want to force it on you.
I just wanted to say thanks.

657
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,449
You're fucked.

658
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,039
Sorry?

659
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:39,461
I took your keys.
I went to your house.

660
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,832
I wanted to sort this shit out.

661
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:47,299
I saw him.

662
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:54,431
Yeah. Was he there? What did he say?

663
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:58,055
A load of lies.
Did he lay on the charm?

664
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,938
What have you done, girl?

665
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:09,074
What... what's wrong?

666
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,413
What are you looking at?

667
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:19,001
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
You know nothing about me!

668
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:22,087
You don't know
what that bastard did to me!

669
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:37,762
He... He raped me.

670
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,605
Oh, God...

671
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,607
He put things inside me.

672
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:51,067
He put glass inside me.

673
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,786
I wanted to have babies.

674
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:04,380
All I wanted was to have babies
and to be a mummy.

675
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,342
Oh, God! Help!

676
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:27,353
Please help.

677
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,235
Will you hold me?

678
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,287
Will you hold me, please?

679
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,536
No...

680
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:50,130
Please... Heavenly Father, help me.

681
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:11,818
'Dear Hannah.
