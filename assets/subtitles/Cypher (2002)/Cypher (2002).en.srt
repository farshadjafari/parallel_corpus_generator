1
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:39,550
Planning a vacation, Mr. Sullivan?

2
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:46,056
No. No. Just - just some
reading to pass the time.

3
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,272
Step ahead, Mr. Sullivan.

4
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:57,026
You're expected in Room 102.
Down the hall and to the right.

5
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,944
Thank you.

6
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:18,172
- What is your name?
- Um- Morgan Sullivan.

7
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:24,929
- Where were you born?
- Madison, Wisconsin.

8
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:29,892
- Are you a spy?
- No.

9
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,895
Are you an undercover
operator for Sunways Systems?

10
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,063
No.

11
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,856
Were you paid by Sunways Systems

12
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,901
to steal data from
Digicorp Technologies?

13
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:40,110
No.

14
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,157
Have you ever worked at any
capacities at Sunways Systems?

15
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:46,325
No.

16
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:49,745
This is a technology firm, Mr. Sullivan.

17
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:52,665
If we choose to employ you
as an agent of Digicorp,

18
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:54,750
you will spy on other corporations,

19
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,919
inform us of their business plans,

20
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,297
research programs, and
counter-intelligence operations.

21
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:04,510
Thus far, your determination
has been very impressive.

22
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:09,640
Well, if there is anything more
I can tell you about myself,

23
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,435
anything that has not been
already checked by Digicorp.

24
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:16,814
Your personal records are fine. You've
passed our neuro-graph five times.

25
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,275
I'll take the test again
if you'd like me to.

26
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:20,985
You've been married four years.

27
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:23,195
You live in a respectable neighbourhood.

28
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,406
You've always had stable jobs.

29
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:27,575
You have an excellent credit history.

30
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:30,703
No drug habits. No drinking problems.

31
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,830
- You don't smoke?
- No.

32
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:35,708
No other vices to speak of?

33
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:39,670
Is there anything else
we should know about you?

34
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,049
Well -- It might
have taken me

35
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,802
quite a while to get to
this point, Mr. Finster,

36
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:52,433
but now that I'm here, I'm
going to make the most of it.

37
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,898
This is who I am

38
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:04,153
and this is what I want to do.

39
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:14,079
The stakes in this line
of work are very high.

40
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,081
Yes, I understand.

41
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,583
It will be like nothing
you've ever done before.

42
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,210
Oh, I'm prepared for that.

43
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,962
You will be sent to
conventions across the country.

44
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,048
You will record the speeches.

45
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,633
That's been made very clear.

46
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,636
You'll have to deceive other people
about what you do for a living.

47
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,639
- Yes.
- Even your own wife.

48
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:33,641
Yes.

49
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,893
You don't mind lying to your wife?

50
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:40,189
No.

51
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,944
No, I don't mind.

52
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:51,951
That was a good one. Move
on ahead to the next station.

53
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:00,626
- Hello, Mr. Sullivan.
- Hello.

54
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,086
Keep it out of view

55
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:04,213
until the convention
speeches actually start.

56
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:05,422
Press the back notch.

57
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,883
You see the flash? It's now on.

58
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:09,885
Press it again. It's now off.

59
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,637
Easy, isn't it?

60
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:13,889
And the transmissions are really clear?

61
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:14,974
Within fifty yards.

62
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:17,142
Just keep up front for good reception.

63
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,769
Where do the signals go?

64
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:22,314
Up to our satellite systems,
then back down to our data banks.

65
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,735
I guess the speeches
must be pretty important.

66
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:29,405
The speeches are not your
concern, Mr. Sullivan.

67
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:30,865
Just do your job.

68
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:34,159
Follow our instructions,
nothing else. Do you understand?

69
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,495
Yes, Mr. Finster.

70
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,289
Ready!

71
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,970
Jack Thursby? That's what
you'll be called from now on.

72
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:56,932
As far as Digicorp concerns,
Morgan Sullivan doesn't exist.

73
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,310
We've never met him. We never will.

74
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:03,772
- What's he like?
- Pardon?

75
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,277
What's his personality?

76
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,907
He's whoever you want him to be.

77
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:33,028
Buffalo? Why do they need you
to go all the way to Buffalo?

78
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:35,197
They want me to tutor them

79
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,784
on that spreadsheet software
I was using at my last job.

80
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:40,327
And you'll be paid freelance for this?

81
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,873
Sure. Independent contract.

82
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:50,713
You know, if things work out, there
could be more trips down the road.

83
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,091
I thought we agreed you
weren't going back to work yet.

84
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:57,678
Not until that position at
my father's firm opened up.

85
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,471
I can do this in the meantime, can't I?

86
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:02,183
I really need you at
home right now, Morgan,

87
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:03,976
with me being so busy
with the Williams case.

88
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:09,523
It's only temporary, honey.
I won't be gone for long.

89
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,965
Hello.

90
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,051
After the convention, you will confirm

91
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:39,094
the transmission on
your returning flight.

92
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:40,179
Yes.

93
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,723
Do you remember the
location of the briefcase?

94
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,849
Uh, yes.

95
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,684
Good luck, Mr. Thursby.
We're counting on you.

96
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,144
Thank you.

97
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:28,269
I left it in the stall.

98
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,264
Something to drink, sir?

99
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,437
I'll have a ginger ale.

100
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:21,447
- Actually, I'll have a scotch.
- Scotch?

101
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:24,825
Hmm. Single malt.

102
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,622
- On the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:42,301
Welcome to Buffalo, Mr. Thursby.

104
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:35,479
This is our new mascara line.

105
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:39,275
- It's hypoallergenic and it's
vitamin enriched. - Really? Mr-

106
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:46,532
- Fred Garfield.
- Hi. Hi. Jack Thursby.

107
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:49,827
Fairway Fragrance. Where
are they located exactly?

108
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:53,247
Uh
- Tulsa. Tulsa, Oklahoma.

109
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,375
You don't say? I've
got family from Tulsa.

110
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,710
You don't have much of an accent.

111
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,173
- I didn't grow up there.
- Oh, where did you grow up?

112
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,888
- I said, where'd you grow up?
- South Pacific.

113
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:12,725
- I'm sorry, where?
- The South Pacific Islands.

114
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:17,646
The Tuamotu Archipelago. French
Polynesia. Tahiti. Papeete.

115
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,191
Wow. That's pretty unusual.

116
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:24,278
Yeah, I plan to go back
there someday when I retire.

117
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:25,821
Water, sir?

118
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:32,745
- Thanks.
- Well, see you around, Jack.

119
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:37,082
Sure thing, Fred.

120
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:42,379
The conference room will
be open in five minutes.

121
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,431
Good morning, everyone.

122
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:56,018
My name is Robert Tuttle.
I'll be your first speaker.

123
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,355
I will first discuss shaving
cream distribution outlets

124
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:00,940
in North American markets.

125
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,568
Let me begin by acknowledging
what has become axiomatic

126
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,946
in the field of shaving
cream distribution.

127
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:09,073
Mainly that shaving cream,

128
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:11,784
indeed almost all personal
hygiene products for men,

129
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:16,247
is what we call fashion resistant.

130
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:19,250
The overwhelming majority
of shaving cream users

131
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,210
will adopt a brand
and remain loyal to it.

132
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,878
It is especially interesting to note,

133
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:25,965
the difference in methods
used to penetrate that market.

134
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:29,468
Because these two methods employed
by the respective companies

135
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:33,222
really illustrates the essential
strategic choice that faces-

136
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:37,268
- The Mediterranean.
- Yes.

137
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:41,897
The Mediterranean is beautiful, of
course; but if it's real sailing you want,

138
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:47,152
I recommend the Sunda Islands in the Banda
Sea. I was there on a trip last spring.

139
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:51,323
- Your cigarettes, sir.
- Thank you very much.

140
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:58,455
Hmm, Cohibas, my
favourite brand. Thank you.

141
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:04,670
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

142
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,722
Would you excuse me?

143
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,429
Good evening, sir. What'll it be?

144
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:58,599
Give me a scotch. Single
malt, on the rocks.

145
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,725
You got it.

146
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:07,316
Haven't we seen each other before?

147
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,530
You'll have to come up with
something more original than that.

148
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,003
I'm here for the convention.

149
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:31,590
That's fascinating.

150
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:35,678
- You're in marketing, right?
- Uh-uh. Sales.

151
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:40,140
- Is there a difference?
- What about you?

152
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:43,519
I do health inspections
of hotel restaurants.

153
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,397
- That sounds interesting.
- No, it doesn't.

154
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:51,735
- Do you have an answer for everything?
- Yes.

155
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:02,454
Rita Foster.

156
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,836
Jack Thursby.

157
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,159
So what do you do besides
travel to dull cities

158
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,161
and talk to women in hotel bars?

159
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:47,833
- I- - uh- play golf.
- Are you any good?

160
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:54,882
- No.
- Honesty. I like that.

161
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:00,262
What else do you like?

162
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,350
No commitments. No bullshit.

163
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:11,941
- And no rings.
- No rings?

164
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:13,943
You might want to take yours off?

165
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:19,657
Oh, I'm sorry.

166
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:27,331
I'll leave you alone now.

167
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:35,798
Your transmission came
through, Mr. Thursby.

168
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:37,550
The signal was clear.

169
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,635
I can do something else on my next trip.

170
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:42,555
I think I'm ready to
handle a bigger assignment.

171
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,266
We'll be sending you
to Omaha next Wednesday.

172
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:46,684
Omaha?

173
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:49,687
You'll perform the same job
that you did in Buffalo.

174
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:31,395
Omaha? Why can't they
find someone in Omaha?

175
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,319
Why do they need to fly you all the
way out there? It doesn't make sense.

176
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,154
Morgan.

177
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,908
Morgan, are you listening to me?

178
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:51,999
Since when did you ever care about golf?

179
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,630
You're not going on this
trip, Morgan. I'm sorry.

180
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:00,508
What do you mean, I'm not going?

181
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,303
My father wants you to
come to his office tomorrow.

182
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,262
Getting a position with his company

183
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:08,140
is more important than
a silly freelance job.

184
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,100
I said I'd go.

185
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,812
You're not going,
Morgan. End of discussion.

186
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:18,859
You're staying here. I'll call
my father tonight and we'll-

187
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:22,363
Tell your father to go fuck himself.

188
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:30,871
What did you just say?
Say you're sorry, Morgan!

189
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,207
Morgan!

190
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,294
If you don't apologize, I
want you out of this house.

191
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:42,007
Morgan! Are you listening to me?

192
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,343
What in God's name has gotten into you.

193
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:48,806
Since when did you
start smoking? Morgan!

194
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:53,269
Morgan, what's going on? I
think I deserve an explanation.

195
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:02,987
Your scotch, Mr. Thursby.

196
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,293
Turn around slowly, please.

197
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,220
What is your transmission device?

198
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,806
I thought you were a health inspector.

199
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,852
I'll ask you again:

200
00:21:57,852 --> 00:22:00,479
what is your transmission device?

201
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:04,400
The pen, in my jacket pocket.

202
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,376
Do not turn the pen on.

203
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:23,627
What?

204
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,881
When you're inside the convention
room, keep the pen turn off.

205
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:29,258
Do not send the
transmission to Digicorp.

206
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:33,095
If you tell Digicorp you
met me, they'll kill you.

207
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,348
Take two every six hours,

208
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,517
it will get rid of the
nightmares you've been having.

209
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:43,772
Your headaches will go away, too,
and the pain in the back of your neck.

210
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:46,400
How do you know
that I'm having nightmares?

211
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:47,860
We'll be in touch in Boise.

212
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:51,447
What will they do if
I don't turn on my pen?

213
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:58,954
Just remember who you are. You are
Morgan Sullivan. You are not Jack Thursby.

214
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,842
Wait!

215
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:29,777
Good morning, everyone. I'm Alex
Chen. I'll be your first speaker.

216
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:33,197
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
here to address the controversy

217
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:34,990
that's been raging around new techniques

218
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,576
in the preparation of process cheese.

219
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:40,204
Now at the risk of oversimplifying

220
00:23:40,204 --> 00:23:44,834
the question facing the average
manufacturer of process cheese is this:

221
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,794
Given an increased consumer prejudice

222
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:48,379
against chemical additives,

223
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:49,964
how do we stem the tide away

224
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:52,550
from natural or organic based products
and instil in the cheese buyer.

225
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:57,096
I'm glad to hear that there were no
problems at the convention, Mr. Thursby.

226
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:01,225
I'll call down to the lab to make
sure the transmission went through.

227
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:07,106
Excellent work, Mr. Thursby.

228
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:09,775
Thank you.

229
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,652
Your transmission
came through perfectly,

230
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,529
just as clear as the last time.

231
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:17,324
I want you to take
another trip. Boise, Idaho.

232
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:19,535
Boise?

233
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:22,955
We scheduled a connecting flight
for you to board when you landed.

234
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:26,292
You won't have time to go home.
That's not a problem, is it?

235
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,670
No. No problem.

236
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:34,068
Room 1493, Mr. Thursby.

237
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:36,362
The convention room
will be open in an hour.

238
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:38,030
Thank you.

239
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:41,700
Mr. Thursby! One last thing:

240
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:46,413
the first letter from each word
is the phone number to call her.

241
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,780
Hello, Mr. Sullivan.

242
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,450
You dialled a special number that
can't be traced or monitored.

243
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,077
Now, listen carefully.

244
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,663
Take the service elevator at the end
of the hall down to the basement level.

245
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:29,707
You'll be clear for
the next five minutes.

246
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,792
Wait a minute, wait!

247
00:26:49,852 --> 00:26:51,395
Keep moving.

248
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:14,293
Roll up your sleeve, please.
We don't have much time.

249
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:25,721
Are you insane? You're
not sticking that into me!

250
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,057
He has medical training, Mr. Sullivan.

251
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:30,768
I don't care if he's a
fucking brain surgeon!

252
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:31,977
You're not gonna drug me.

253
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:33,103
We're undrugging you.

254
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:35,439
The shot will block out
the Digicorp narcotic.

255
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,524
What?

256
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:39,485
The chemical they're putting in
your bloodstream at every convention.

257
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:42,821
Do you normally drink something
inside the convention room?

258
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:45,032
Mineral water.

259
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:48,536
The drug is tasteless and
odourless. You wouldn't have known.

260
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,120
Did you take the pills I gave you?

261
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:53,541
Had the noises in your
head started to go away?

262
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:57,253
- And the recurring dreams?
- Jesus, what is this?

263
00:27:57,461 --> 00:28:01,048
W-w-why didn't Digicorp check
my transmission in Omaha?

264
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:03,133
There was no transmission in Omaha.

265
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:05,719
Or in Buffalo. Or anywhere else.

266
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:08,097
Why do they send me
to these conventions?

267
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:11,517
- The conventions are charades.
- Charades?

268
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:16,438
You and the other convention guests
all work for Digicorp. You're all spies.

269
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:19,483
You're given phoney
assignments, phoney identities.

270
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:22,027
You think your pen
is a transmitting device,

271
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:25,072
another guest thinks it's
his tie clip or her watch.

272
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:27,783
The whole thing is just a ploy
to keep you all distracted,

273
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:30,452
to not realize what's really going on.

274
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,414
What is really going on?

275
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:39,211
If you want answers, take the shot.

276
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,516
When you're inside the
room, act as you always act.

277
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:54,935
Order the mineral water. Drink it.

278
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,520
Don't make them suspicious.

279
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,606
The shot we gave you should protect you.

280
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:02,443
It should protect? What'd
you mean? What if it doesn't?

281
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,778
Listen to me carefully.

282
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,031
Whatever happens in that room,

283
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,619
show no reaction, no
emotion, no surprise.

284
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:16,624
No matter what you see, do not move.

285
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:21,170
What will I see?

286
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:29,512
- Who sent you?
- A friend.

287
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,848
I don't have any friends.

288
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:37,853
- When will I see you again?
- Soon.

289
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:41,315
I promise.

290
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:50,699
There are several points of interest
here. First of all, the fact, that

291
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:54,078
by an impressive margin,
new home purchases

292
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,997
took most of the brunt of that decline.

293
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:00,709
By this I mean that sales of older homes

294
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,419
are done on an individual basis

295
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:05,214
where there's considerably
more room for negotiation.

296
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:09,426
Therefore, in those sales
we're more likely to find

297
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,264
that the official rise in
mortgage rates has been offset

298
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:17,643
somewhat by the ...rates of
return on high tech investment,

299
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:21,021
which led to a surge in
business capital spending

300
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:25,776
and significantly increased the
underlying growth rate of productivity.

301
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:29,989
The capitalization of these
higher than expected returns

302
00:30:29,989 --> 00:30:31,824
boosted equity prices

303
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:37,621
generally beyond even that expected
by the enhanced rise in real incomes.

304
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:40,457
The elevated level of light
vehicle sales, for example,

305
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:45,087
has put more vehicles on the road
than the industry could sustain.

306
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:48,048
And even though demand for
the number of high tech products

307
00:30:48,257 --> 00:30:50,301
was doubling or tripling annually,

308
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:54,054
in many cases new supply
was coming on ever faster.

309
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,974
Overall capacity in high
tech manufacturing industries

310
00:30:56,974 --> 00:31:00,227
rose nearly 50 percent last year,

311
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:03,147
well in excess of its
rapid rate of increase.

312
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:08,861
Accordingly the slowdown in the economy that
began in the middle of last year intensified,

313
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:12,907
perhaps even to the point of growth
stalling out around the turn of the year.

314
00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:17,203
As the economy slowed,
equity prices fell,

315
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:20,122
especially in the high tech sector,

316
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:24,126
where previous high evaluations
were being re-evaluated,

317
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:27,963
resulting in significant
losses in some investors.

318
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:31,383
Clearly some slowing in the
pace of spending was necessary,

319
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:36,305
if the economy was to progress along
balanced and sustainable growth.

320
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:44,897
<i>With the process likely to intensify
with the rise in the cost of energy</i>

321
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,109
<i>that has strained business
and household purchasing power,</i>

322
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:51,946
<i>purchases of durable
goods and investment</i>

323
00:31:52,154 --> 00:31:55,115
<i>in capital equipment
declined in the fourth quarter.</i>

324
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:59,495
<i>Because the slowdown
was not anticipated by business,</i>

325
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:07,044
<i>it induced some backup in inventories,
despite more advanced technologies...</i>

326
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:15,511
<i>Inventory sales ratios
rose only moderately,</i>

327
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:19,807
and even after the policy
actions taken in January,

328
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:23,727
<i>the risk continue skewed toward
the economies remaining on a path</i>

329
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:27,940
<i>inconsistent with satisfactory
economic performance.</i>

330
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:30,609
<i>Crucial to the assessment
of the outlook and the understanding</i>

331
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:32,611
<i>of recent policy options,</i>

332
00:32:32,945 --> 00:32:36,115
<i>is the role of the technological
change in productivity</i>

333
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,617
<i>in shaping near-term transcyclical forces</i>

334
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:41,036
<i>as well as long term
sustainable growth,</i>

335
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:45,291
<i>perceptible for sustaining
slow advances in quality...</i>

336
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,854
Just a reflex.

337
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:14,904
<i>...Managers appear to be more generally
sanguine about the potential for innovation.</i>

338
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,215
You are not Morgan Sullivan. You are Jack
Thursby. You are not married to Amy Sullivan.

339
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:20,177
Your wife is Diane Thursby.

340
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:53,919
Your wife is Diane Thursby.

341
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:58,424
You live in Redmond, Washington.

342
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:24,200
<i>Accordingly to foster

344
00:35:29,955 --> 00:35:35,377
and in conclusion, a cautious
approach is always the best strategy.

345
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:40,508
Thank you for your attention.

346
00:35:56,732 --> 00:36:00,861
Excuse me, do you have the time?

347
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:07,868
- The time? Your watch?
- Yeah, it's 3:30.

348
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:11,205
Already? Gosh, the last
speech just flew by.

349
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:12,373
Yeah.

350
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:15,376
Did you enjoy it?

351
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:18,754
Oh, yeah. Very much.

352
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:57,543
Hello?

353
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:02,006
It's for you.

354
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:09,430
Digicorp will approach you at the
airport. Tell them you are Jack Thursby.

355
00:37:09,638 --> 00:37:11,724
Tell them you've never
heard of Morgan Sullivan.

356
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,434
Make them think you're brainwashed.

357
00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:16,145
If you're exposed, they'll kill you.

358
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:17,897
What happened back there?

359
00:37:18,147 --> 00:37:21,066
You're feeling the side effects of
the neutralizing agent in your system.

360
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,945
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

361
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:08,739
Mr. Sullivan. There's been a
change of plans, Mr. Sullivan.

362
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:11,951
You need to come to Digicorp's
local office right away.

363
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:14,245
Mr. Sullivan?

364
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:16,872
Mr. Sullivan?

365
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:25,381
Are you all right?

366
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:30,970
I think you're mistaken.
My name isn't Sullivan.

367
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:35,432
You're not Morgan Sullivan?

368
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:40,563
- You don't work for Digicorp?
- No. My name is Thursby. Jack Thursby.

369
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:45,067
I think you're looking
for somebody else.

370
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:50,823
I'm sorry, Mr. Thursby. My mistake.

371
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:54,326
That's okay.

372
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:17,766
Hello, sir. How are you?

373
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:21,687
I just need to see your
boarding pass, please. Thank you.

374
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,165
Thank you.

375
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,209
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

376
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:50,508
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

377
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:19,847
Your turn. There's not
much hot water left. Sorry.

378
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,543
Could you make dinner a
half hour earlier tonight?

379
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:51,795
Sure.

380
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:54,507
I wrote down a list of
errands I need you to do today.

381
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,217
Okay.

382
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:58,719
Your car keys are in the
foyer next to your briefcase,

383
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:00,554
right where you left them.

384
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:55,693
Planning a trip?

385
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:57,945
Just some reading to pass the time.

386
00:42:58,154 --> 00:43:00,030
You're expected in
reception, Mr. Thursby.

387
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:02,324
Down the hall and to the left.

388
00:43:12,334 --> 00:43:16,547
- What's your name?
- Jack Thursby.

389
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:38,027
My name's Frank Callaway. I'm head
of security for Sunways Systems.

390
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,367
According to your
neuro-graph, you're lying.

391
00:43:45,576 --> 00:43:48,621
You're lying when you say
that your name is Jack Thursby.

392
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,458
You're lying when you say that
you are not an undercover agent.

393
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:57,463
You are lying when you say that
you do not work for Digicorp.

394
00:44:01,592 --> 00:44:06,180
And I cannot tell you
how happy that makes us.

395
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:10,809
No way. I am not going
back to that house.

396
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:13,062
You are in a unique
position here, Morgan.

397
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,732
Digicorp thinks that you're
brainwashed as Jack Thursby.

398
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:18,984
They think that you passed
our neuro-graph

399
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:21,362
and they want us to hire you
as one of our agents.

400
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,655
I don't care what they want.

401
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:26,325
Your counter intelligence work
for Sunways will be very simple.

402
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:29,453
Digicorp will never suspect
that you're working for us.

403
00:44:29,578 --> 00:44:32,665
So they won't watch you too
closely while you're in the house.

404
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:36,710
All you have to do is to
place one bug in each room.

405
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,340
You don't fucking understand. I'm
going home. I'm going to my real home.

406
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:43,092
Your real home is gone, Morgan.

407
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:44,635
What are you talking about?

408
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,137
Your wife put your house up for sale.

409
00:44:47,304 --> 00:44:51,267
Her lawyer has been trying to
contact you for the last few days.

410
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:54,103
She filed for divorce three days ago.

411
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:57,022
I'm sorry, Morgan.

412
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:02,486
- Look, Morgan, I know this is hard.
- I want to see Rita.

413
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:05,197
- Who?
- Rita Foster.

414
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:08,868
- She pulled me out of the brainwashing.
- No, Morgan. You cannot see her.

415
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:12,538
- Why not? She works for you.
- She does not work for us.

416
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:15,040
But you sent her to find me
at the hotels, right?

417
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:16,500
No.

418
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:20,838
But you know who she works for?

419
00:45:22,673 --> 00:45:24,884
Who does she work for?

420
00:45:24,884 --> 00:45:29,388
- She works for Sebastian Rooks.
- Who's Sebastian Rooks?

421
00:45:29,597 --> 00:45:33,642
Sebastian Rooks is a freelance
operative who we hired

422
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:36,729
to find out how Digicorp was getting
their agents past our neuro-graph.

423
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:40,399
Then we asked him to send us
an agent who wasn't brainwashed.

424
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:42,067
He delivered you.

425
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:47,281
He's the best in the business, but he's
also very dangerous and very ruthless.

426
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,076
I advise you to stay away from him.

427
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:55,164
Stay away from him and her.

428
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:05,090
Look,

429
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:09,720
we are offering you
a very good deal here.

430
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:15,351
When your work for us is finished,
we'll give you a new identity

431
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:21,273
and a new home, somewhere very
far away and safe from Digicorp.

432
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:24,401
I'm sorry, Mr. Callaway,

433
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:28,030
but you'll have to find
someone else for your job.

434
00:46:32,827 --> 00:46:35,496
You won't last long out there.

435
00:46:35,704 --> 00:46:37,414
Anywhere you go outside this complex,

436
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,959
Digicorp will have agents watching you.

437
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:43,754
If you try to run,

438
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:48,342
if you behave like Morgan
Sullivan instead of Jack Thursby,

439
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:50,761
they will eliminate you.

440
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:56,642
Quick. Efficient. Ruthless.

441
00:47:04,984 --> 00:47:09,321
You're fortunate, Morgan. If we hadn't
interrupted the brainwashing process

442
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,366
you'd be like the
other convention guests:

443
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:16,245
programmed with a new identity and
sent to companies across the globe,

444
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:20,875
disposed of when you're
no more useful to Digicorp.

445
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:25,629
You have a chance to fight back.

446
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:32,720
So, are you ready to be a spy, Morgan?

447
00:47:48,486 --> 00:47:51,989
I'm gonna get some more broccoli.

448
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:04,645
Phone lines are tapped.

449
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,943
We've got visual in all the rooms.

450
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:18,284
There they are in the dining room.

451
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:22,913
The salt shaker gives a
nice angle, doesn't it?

452
00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:25,040
Very well. He believes
he's Jack Thursby.

453
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:27,710
He believes I'm his wife.
He's adjusted to this house.

454
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:31,714
- Who's she talking to?
- Digicorp agents.

455
00:49:31,922 --> 00:49:34,633
She's giving them a report on you.

456
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:37,636
He spends much of his time indoors.

457
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:41,056
Of course he has no friends and he has
little contact with the outside world.

458
00:49:41,056 --> 00:49:44,310
We've got the internet lines tapped too.

459
00:49:44,518 --> 00:49:48,355
Excellent work, Morgan. Excellent.

460
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:51,567
My God.

461
00:49:52,568 --> 00:49:56,197
My life is the same as it ever was.

462
00:49:56,405 --> 00:50:00,117
That's because Digicorp monitored
your old life and then duplicated it.

463
00:50:00,326 --> 00:50:02,870
It helps ease the transition
of becoming another person.

464
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:06,332
That's not who I am anymore.

465
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:14,215
I
- I smoke cigarettes.

466
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:17,718
I like to drink scotch.

467
00:50:17,718 --> 00:50:18,719
I play golf.

468
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,681
I'm not supposed to live in the suburbs.

469
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:26,477
I'm not supposed to be like that.

470
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:29,271
I'm sorry if you're
disappointed, Morgan.

471
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:32,107
But that is your vision of Jack Thursby.

472
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:36,320
It's not Digicorp's.

473
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:42,743
Can you guys clean up the
camera reception in that hallway?

474
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:32,001
Yes, Jamison?

475
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:37,256
This isn't Jamison. It's
Morgan Sullivan. Bitch.

476
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:46,557
- What do you want, Mr. Sullivan?
- I need your help.

477
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,935
I want to hire Sebastian Rooks.

478
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:55,024
- Are you still there?
- Goodbye, Mr. Sullivan.

479
00:51:55,232 --> 00:51:57,568
- I'll pay him for his service.
- He doesn't work for individuals.

480
00:51:57,776 --> 00:51:59,403
Ask him to make an exception.

481
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:02,406
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're on your own, I'm sorry.

482
00:52:02,615 --> 00:52:05,326
No. No!

483
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:08,954
- Listen, you gotta help me.
- There's nothing I can-

484
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:10,206
You gotta help me, please.

485
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,295
You said I could trust you. I
believed you when you said that.

486
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:21,383
Meet me at the carwash at Fourth
and Jefferson in three hours.

487
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:33,187
Morgan! We'll be sending you on
your first assignment next week.

488
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:36,315
Our surveillance of your
house has already paid off.

489
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:39,568
We know exactly what sort of data
Digicorp is trying to steal from us.

490
00:52:40,194 --> 00:52:44,865
So tonight you will say that you're
going out of town on a business trip.

491
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:48,160
Now, you know how to
tell her that, right?

492
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:52,998
- Morgan?
- Yes.

493
00:52:57,962 --> 00:53:00,214
You will stick
to the script, Morgan.

494
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:04,218
You won't try anything risky,
do you understand me?

495
00:53:07,304 --> 00:53:10,474
Sebastian Rooks has agreed to help you.

496
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:15,563
- When does he want to meet me?
- Not yet. He's in the car behind us.

497
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,989
- How much money does Rooks want?
- He's not interested in your money.

498
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:27,908
It's your situation. He thinks
he can use it to his advantage.

499
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:31,620
- How?
- I'll be in touch with you in Wichita.

500
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,622
Wichita?

501
00:53:33,664 --> 00:53:35,833
That's where Sunways will be
sending you for your last assignment.

502
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:39,336
How do you know that?
They haven't even told me.

503
00:53:39,545 --> 00:53:42,631
Rooks knows. He knows everything.

504
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:46,802
- Can I trust Rooks?
- I can't give you guarantees.

505
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:51,974
But he has the resources to provide
you with a new life, a new identity.

506
00:53:52,183 --> 00:53:54,435
It's your choice, Mr. Sullivan.

507
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,063
What do I have to do?

508
00:53:59,106 --> 00:54:01,400
Sunways will send you on
a series of assignments.

509
00:54:03,235 --> 00:54:06,071
You'll receive a courier
disk on each trip.

510
00:54:06,697 --> 00:54:10,159
Digicorp agents will be
following you wherever you do.

511
00:54:10,493 --> 00:54:13,454
Let them, that's what Sunways wants.

512
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:24,590
At each destination you'll
be met by a Sunways contact.

513
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:28,010
They'll download data onto your disk.

514
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:35,559
Digicorp's agents will assume you're
receiving valuable information.

515
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,273
As you travel to more cities,

516
00:54:41,273 --> 00:54:43,359
collect more data, and
complete more assignments,

517
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:45,903
your agent status will rise.

518
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:47,238
Digicorp will then assume you

519
00:54:47,238 --> 00:54:49,740
have become one of
Sunways top company men.

520
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,546
Jack?

521
00:55:04,797 --> 00:55:08,175
Each disk you bring home will
seem more important than the last.

522
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:15,349
As they copy the Sunways files,
Digicorp will think they have won

523
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,102
a major victory against
their greatest rival.

524
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:22,231
In reality, Digicorp is the loser.

525
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:26,652
Sunways is feeding them corrupt data
that will sabotage their operations.

526
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:30,406
But make no mistake, Mr. Sullivan.

527
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:33,450
Sunways is just as ruthless as Digicorp.

528
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:38,497
Once this operation is complete,
they will eliminate you.

529
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:43,169
Rooks will protect you.

530
00:55:46,338 --> 00:55:48,924
Please. You can trust me.

531
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:55,556
We're sending you to Kansas. Wichita.

532
00:55:57,308 --> 00:55:59,935
It's almost over, Morgan.

533
00:56:00,144 --> 00:56:04,440
After this trip to the vault,
your work for us will be finished.

534
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:07,568
- The vault?
- It's our data warehouse.

535
00:56:07,776 --> 00:56:11,739
It's completely isolated from the outside
world, but we send in agent couriers

536
00:56:11,947 --> 00:56:14,074
if we need to retrieve or add a file.

537
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:19,121
You will be our next courier.

538
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:26,212
And Digicorp will they
have hit the mother lode.

539
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:06,627
Shh! We need to keep our voices down. Switch
this disk with the one in your briefcase,

540
00:57:06,836 --> 00:57:11,382
before you go to the
vault. Take off your ring.

541
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:15,803
- What?
- Your ring.

542
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:26,897
This is a tracking device. We'll know
your precise location at all times.

543
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:32,903
Does this mean we can
see each other again?

544
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:35,906
I pick you up after you leave
the vault, deliver you to Rooks.

545
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:41,412
- I mean, after that?
- We can never see each other again.

546
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,292
It would compromise your identity.

547
00:57:53,424 --> 00:57:57,595
I'm never getting out of this, am I?

548
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:24,431
500 Horse Creek Road, please.

549
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,518
I know where to go.

550
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:35,317
Settle down, Mr. Sullivan. We
have a long ride ahead of us.

551
00:59:55,588 --> 00:59:59,341
You don't have to pretend to be Thursby.

552
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,678
I know you're not brainwashed.

553
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:08,100
I know that Sunways has been using
you as a double agent against Digicorp.

554
01:00:10,853 --> 01:00:13,606
Are you going to kill me?

555
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:17,067
Not if you turn your loyalties to me

556
01:00:17,276 --> 01:00:22,781
instead of Sebastian Rooks. Oh,
yeah. I know that you work for him.

557
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:30,623
As a matter of fact, we both do.
I'm Rooks' inside source at Digicorp.

558
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:35,961
- His what?
- He paid me to hire you

559
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:41,759
so you could be his pawn once
you were sent off to Sunways.

560
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:46,222
You didn't think I hired you because
I was impressed by you, did you?

561
01:00:49,934 --> 01:00:52,561
It's a good plan, really.

562
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:56,732
Rooks knew that you'd end up here in
Kansas on the way to the Sunways vault.

563
01:00:56,941 --> 01:01:00,277
He knew he could convince you
to switch their disk with his.

564
01:01:00,486 --> 01:01:05,157
- That was his scheme from the very start.
- It's not possible.

565
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:09,453
Rooks' disk contains a search program.

566
01:01:09,662 --> 01:01:12,623
It penetrates the vault's secure network

567
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:16,460
and quietly steal a data file
without triggering any alarms.

568
01:01:16,752 --> 01:01:19,171
What data file?

569
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,676
Who knows? But if Rooks has gone
through all this trouble to get it,

570
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:26,887
it must be extremely valuable.

571
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,474
The plan was foolproof.

572
01:01:30,683 --> 01:01:34,687
Except for one factor
he failed to consider:

573
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:37,231
me.

574
01:01:37,439 --> 01:01:38,858
What do you want?

575
01:01:38,858 --> 01:01:42,528
When you come out of the vault,
deliver the disk to me, not Rooks.

576
01:01:42,528 --> 01:01:44,572
I've been loyal to Digicorp all along.

577
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,033
Why should I trust you or Digicorp?

578
01:01:48,242 --> 01:01:51,495
Because we'll let you live and
Rooks won't. It's as simple as that.

579
01:01:51,704 --> 01:01:55,708
No one sees his face and
lives to tell about it.

580
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:57,501
No one sees his face?

581
01:01:57,501 --> 01:02:00,629
He's a deep cover operative.
A Yuri in cyberspace.

582
01:02:00,713 --> 01:02:05,509
He's a phantom. Companies hire him
without actually knowing who he is.

583
01:02:05,718 --> 01:02:08,637
If they did, they'd kill him.

584
01:02:08,846 --> 01:02:15,060
The moment you give that disk to
Rooks is the moment he eliminates you.

585
01:02:17,062 --> 01:02:21,567
There's only one person Rooks
trusts with his identity:

586
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:26,280
Rita Foster, his lover.

587
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:32,536
She's completely loyal
to him. No one else.

588
01:02:33,662 --> 01:02:38,083
I'm the only person you can trust now.

589
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,468
I'll be nearby when you come out.

590
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:52,723
Just in case we get separated.

591
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:58,145
No charge for the ride.

592
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:35,659
Good evening, Mr. Thursby.

593
01:04:45,544 --> 01:04:48,255
My name's Virgil Dunn.

594
01:04:49,548 --> 01:04:52,551
Welcome to the vault.

595
01:05:12,029 --> 01:05:13,447
Your first time?

596
01:05:15,574 --> 01:05:19,537
Hope you didn't have a big dinner.

597
01:05:44,436 --> 01:05:46,605
Step ahead, please.

598
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:17,928
Now that we know you are bug free,

599
01:06:18,137 --> 01:06:21,891
I can call you by
your real name, Morgan.

600
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:28,189
Dunn, Virgil C.

601
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:45,683
I need your disk now, please.

602
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,984
Good, good.

603
01:08:33,105 --> 01:08:36,525
Digicorp will cream in their pants

604
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:39,320
when they copy the bogus data
that I just cooked up for them.

605
01:08:40,654 --> 01:08:42,323
You wouldn't believe
the number of times

606
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:45,034
they tried to jack
into the systems down here.

607
01:08:45,784 --> 01:08:48,370
- Have they ever succeeded?
- Hell, no.

608
01:08:49,663 --> 01:08:54,710
This place is tighter
than a nun's asshole.

609
01:09:05,095 --> 01:09:08,891
Uh, snort while we wait?

610
01:09:09,099 --> 01:09:10,976
Sure.

611
01:09:11,185 --> 01:09:15,898
I distilled it myself down here. One
of my little hobbies to pass the time.

612
01:09:26,242 --> 01:09:30,538
- Thanks.
- Here's to the information agent.

613
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:43,467
I used to be an agent like you once.

614
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:46,846
I was the best mole
spotter in the business.

615
01:09:47,054 --> 01:09:49,431
You put me in a room with
a possible double agent,

616
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:51,725
let me ask him a couple of questions,

617
01:09:51,934 --> 01:09:55,187
and I could tell you right there
whether he was a spy or not.

618
01:09:55,813 --> 01:10:00,901
That was before Sunways sent me
down here. That was three years ago.

619
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:05,281
- What happened?
- Those fucking machines is what happened.

620
01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:10,411
They said the neuro-graphs were
100% accurate, but I wasn't.

621
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:16,041
That a really good spy, a really
good liar, could trick me every time.

622
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,837
It's bullshit, I told them.

623
01:10:20,045 --> 01:10:22,464
But they wouldn't listen.

624
01:10:22,673 --> 01:10:30,598
You see, there are things that only a person
can know about another person, Mr. Sullivan,

625
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:34,143
things that a machine
could never pick up.

626
01:10:34,351 --> 01:10:37,646
For example, let me ask you
a couple of questions.

627
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:39,023
Excuse me?

628
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:44,195
What is your favourite drink? Go ahead.
Answer. I just want to prove my point.

629
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:48,032
What is your favourite drink?

630
01:10:51,202 --> 01:10:54,955
Er, scotch, single malt, on the rocks.

631
01:10:55,956 --> 01:10:59,168
You're telling the truth.

632
01:10:59,376 --> 01:11:02,880
- Are you married?
- Yes, I am.

633
01:11:04,089 --> 01:11:09,470
Truth again. See, you're very
- very easy to read.

634
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:15,851
Now
- Are you in love with your wife?

635
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:28,447
- Yes.
- There, you just lied. Am I right?

636
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:36,539
Yes, I lied.

637
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:46,423
It's more than just questions, however.

638
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:55,474
For instance, I'm sensing
a kind of tension in you.

639
01:11:58,394 --> 01:12:03,607
It's been evident ever since
I put your disk in my computer.

640
01:12:03,816 --> 01:12:08,487
Now why would that be? We both
know the disk is from Sunways.

641
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:13,576
That's nothing that
should make you uneasy.

642
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:24,003
- One last question, all right?
- Sure.

643
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:29,300
Are you a double agent?

644
01:13:12,176 --> 01:13:15,221
Where's Mr. Dunn?

645
01:13:16,555 --> 01:13:19,308
He decided to stay in his office.

646
01:13:21,477 --> 01:13:25,856
- Right. You can go ahead, Mr. Sullivan.
- Thank you.

647
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:44,750
Open the door!

648
01:14:21,787 --> 01:14:24,415
Emergency crews are on their way.

649
01:14:24,623 --> 01:14:28,711
For your safety, please
remain inside the elevator.

650
01:14:35,217 --> 01:14:38,679
For your safety, please
remain inside the elevator.

651
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:42,975
Emergency crews are on their way.

652
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:48,272
For your safety, please
remain inside the elevator.

653
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,633
Jump!

654
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:07,309
Now!

655
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:29,874
I told you I'd know where you'd be.

656
01:16:30,082 --> 01:16:33,043
- Is this Rooks?
- I can take the disk now.

657
01:16:33,252 --> 01:16:38,465
Jamison, one of our operatives.
Rooks is back at the hotel.

658
01:16:38,674 --> 01:16:42,136
He's looking forward to seeing you.

659
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:31,060
The car's waiting downstairs.
Call me when you get to the lab.

660
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:38,943
- This is where Rooks lives?
- For now. He moves around a lot.

661
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:44,949
- But you know where he is at all times?
- We have a special relationship.

662
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:52,581
Your assignment is nearly
finished, Mr. Sullivan.

663
01:18:14,895 --> 01:18:18,566
I'll be back in a moment.

664
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:52,892
Finster.

665
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:57,229
- It's Morgan Sullivan.
- Sullivan! What happened to you?

666
01:18:57,438 --> 01:19:00,858
I'm in the penthouse suite of an old
building. I don't know where it is.

667
01:19:01,066 --> 01:19:04,028
We're tracing the call. We'll
be there shortly. Where's Rooks?

668
01:19:04,236 --> 01:19:07,781
- I'm just about to meet him.
- Get off the phone before he sees you.

669
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:13,621
He will kill you, understand? Hold
on to the disk. We're on our way.

670
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:26,217
- Don't come any closer.
- Put the gun down, Mr. Sullivan.

671
01:19:26,425 --> 01:19:30,805
I'll break it. You come
any further, I'll break it.

672
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:36,769
I gave you the Sunways disk. This
one is yours. The one Rooks wants.

673
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:43,943
Stop!

674
01:19:44,235 --> 01:19:50,032
- You really don't want to do that.
- You used me. You and Rooks.

675
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:54,703
- You used me from the very start.
- Wait, let me explain.

676
01:19:54,912 --> 01:19:57,581
No. Finster already
explained everything.

677
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:01,460
- When did you talk to Finster?
- He's on his way. I just called him.

678
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:04,255
If Rooks wants this disk
before Finster arrives,

679
01:20:04,255 --> 01:20:06,298
you better unlock that
door and let me go.

680
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:12,721
Listen to me. Sebastian Rooks is
not the person you think he is.

681
01:20:13,806 --> 01:20:16,308
Sebastian Rooks is a ruthless spy

682
01:20:16,517 --> 01:20:18,269
- and so are you.
- No, you're wrong. He's-

683
01:20:18,477 --> 01:20:20,813
I know about you.

684
01:20:21,021 --> 01:20:25,860
I know about the two of you. I know
about your special relationship.

685
01:20:26,068 --> 01:20:27,194
Please, just hear me out. I-

686
01:20:27,403 --> 01:20:31,073
I don't want to hear any more lies!
I don't want to hear any more lies!

687
01:20:34,702 --> 01:20:40,916
God! I can't believe I thought
you actually cared about me.

688
01:20:43,878 --> 01:20:48,257
- I can't believe I was such a fool.
- I do care about you.

689
01:20:56,891 --> 01:20:59,268
No, no.

690
01:21:00,478 --> 01:21:05,900
Just go see Rooks. It'll be okay.

691
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:18,204
Hurry. Find him.

692
01:23:31,795 --> 01:23:37,343
I tried stopping you, but you insisted.

693
01:23:37,551 --> 01:23:42,389
You said it was the only way to
steal the data from the vault.

694
01:23:42,598 --> 01:23:46,560
Welcome home, Mr. Rooks.

695
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:00,282
Come on. Finster will
be here any minute.

696
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:05,454
No, no. No more lies. You
can't trick me anymore.

697
01:24:05,663 --> 01:24:09,416
Listen to me. You are
not Morgan Sullivan.

698
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:13,128
You created him out of
your own imagination.

699
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:17,091
Your life in the suburbs, your
miserable marriage-- Your wife, Amy,

700
01:24:17,299 --> 01:24:18,926
was one of your own
operatives playing a part

701
01:24:18,968 --> 01:24:21,554
you assigned her.

702
01:24:21,762 --> 01:24:25,432
The more you fight the
truth, the more it'll hurt.

703
01:24:27,643 --> 01:24:29,103
It's not possible.

704
01:24:29,103 --> 01:24:31,939
You used the same brainwashing
technique Digicorp uses.

705
01:24:32,148 --> 01:24:34,900
You were the one who sold them
the technology to begin with.

706
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:37,528
- This makes no sense!
- It makes perfect sense!

707
01:24:38,571 --> 01:24:40,239
By turning yourself into Morgan Sullivan

708
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:43,117
was the only way you could pass
Digicorp's neuro-graph.

709
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:46,912
It was the only way you could get hired
to be their spy and get sent to Sunways.

710
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:50,332
- Why would anyone do this?
- For this.

711
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:54,420
- What's on it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

712
01:24:55,421 --> 01:24:56,672
You don't know?

713
01:24:56,881 --> 01:25:00,217
I've put a lot of faith
into this assignment.

714
01:25:09,268 --> 01:25:11,604
Clear! Freeze! Don't move!

715
01:25:21,071 --> 01:25:25,367
Sunways Security! Identify
yourself! Digicorp Security!

716
01:25:38,923 --> 01:25:42,176
- You're following me, Callaway?
- I'm here for Rooks, not you.

717
01:25:42,384 --> 01:25:45,805
That's who I am here for.

718
01:25:53,771 --> 01:25:58,400
- You've flown this before?
- No, never.

719
01:25:58,609 --> 01:26:03,781
You know how to fly it. You designed it.

720
01:26:12,623 --> 01:26:15,209
- I don't know what to do.
- Sebastian Rooks knows.

721
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:20,297
- I can't remember Sebastian Rooks!
- You remembered that you loved me.

722
01:26:27,263 --> 01:26:30,432
Just think.

723
01:27:25,905 --> 01:27:29,867
We're out.

724
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:41,837
Did you get a look at him?
Did you see Rooks' face?

725
01:27:42,046 --> 01:27:44,215
Just Morgan Sullivan, our pawn.

726
01:27:57,353 --> 01:28:01,273
Jesus! He's Rooks.

727
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:51,091
Is it what you want?

728
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,053
Yes.

729
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:02,353
Yes. It's you.

730
01:30:10,945 --> 01:30:16,158
The file in the vault was
erased. And this is the only copy.

731
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:29,713
Now there's no copy at all.
