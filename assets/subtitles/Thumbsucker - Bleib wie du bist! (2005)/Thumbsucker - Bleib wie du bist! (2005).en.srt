1
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,444
You're good at stuff like this.

2
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,709
I have to find something
distinctive about myself.

3
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,899
-You're beautiful, Audrey.
-Seriously.

4
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,164
He's a cheeseball.

5
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:02,053
I don't think so.

6
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:04,690
Besides, that's just the role
he plays.

7
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:12,434
Maybe we could work
on this together later?

8
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:18,294
Hey.

9
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:30,936
The ocean contains 97 percent
of the Earth's water...

10
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,243
...and generates over 70 percent
of the Earth's oxygen...

11
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:37,047
...and replenishes our fresh water
through the clouds.

12
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:40,019
If our oceans are failing,
then so will we.

13
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,289
Well done. Justin, rebuttal.

14
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:49,354
-Justin?
-Actually, I....

15
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,028
I agree with Rebecca.

16
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,954
I saw this show on Animal Planet...

17
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:56,303
...about how they were giving
depressed male baboons Prozac.

18
00:03:56,512 --> 00:04:01,242
Justin, this isn't Agree Club.
It's Debate Club.

19
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,130
If you had done your research...

20
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:07,228
...you'd have the confidence
to have an opinion.

21
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:11,498
And if you have an opinion that's based
on facts gathered from your research...

22
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:14,009
...then you are confident to speak.

23
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,856
And speaking confidently
does what, class?

24
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,121
Speaking confidently...

25
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:23,051
-Wins minds.
-...that's right, wins minds.

26
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:27,781
Justin...

27
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:32,721
...if you wanna admire Rebecca,
you can do that during recess.

28
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,948
If you wanna compete here,
you're gonna have to apply yourself.

29
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,762
You can have a seat, Rebecca.

30
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:44,483
Sasha, Lewis. Well done, have a seat.

31
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,464
I like the Animal Planet,
though, Justin.

32
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:52,060
Great channel.

33
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,450
Perry is ready for you, Justin.
Come on back.

34
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,250
Open.

35
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,050
Close.

36
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:35,636
Justin, do they teach you about
the subconscious at school?

37
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:39,821
-A little.
-Ever heard of subconscious pressure?

38
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:43,714
-Involuntary behaviours?
-Like a serial killer.

39
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,017
Perhaps.

40
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:51,500
Justin, all of us carry
a certain weight.

41
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,430
A weight we don't recognise.

42
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:57,654
Some of us have heavy loads.

43
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:02,300
-In our minds?
-Yeah. A force from inside.

44
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:07,239
We don't know its name,
but it makes us do things.

45
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,667
Things we don't...

46
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:12,891
...like to admit.

47
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,425
-Your dad still in the six-K?
-Yeah.

48
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,402
He's very attached to the idea
of winning.

49
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:27,039
He was gonna be
a pro football player.

50
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,220
-He didn't get picked up?
-He injured his knee.

51
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,741
I don't think he likes me
always beating him.

52
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,834
It's just for fun.

53
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:15,136
The Oregon State application
came in.

54
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,401
-So?
-So...

55
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,373
...there's nothing wrong
with staying close to home.

56
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,926
-What about New York?
-You don't have those grades.

57
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:27,694
You just haven't applied yourself in
a way admissions people recognise.

58
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,959
You apply to some fancy,
far-off school...

59
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:34,600
-...you might be disappointed.
-Whatever.

60
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:46,028
Plate, honey. Okay....

61
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:49,293
<i>--the front for the liberation
of Palestine. Natalie.</i>

62
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,851
<i>And, Charles, this bombing comes
just one day after the Palestinians...</i>

63
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,279
<i>...paved the way
for a U.S.-back ed peace plan...</i>

64
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:59,298
<i>...by appointing that new cabinet.
How much of a setback could this be?</i>

65
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:01,516
What is that? You're doing it.

66
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,907
-Mike.
-What?

67
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:08,842
-What--?
-What? It's pathetic.

68
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:11,897
-Come on. Go easy on this, Audrey.
-Hey, hey, hey. Listen.

69
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,046
-Maybe you could give yourself a break.
-Come on, stop with the feel-good shit.

70
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:44,004
<i>Hold on a second, now.</i>

71
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,892
<i>-What about T.J. ?
-Well...</i>

72
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,366
<i>...you know I love him. It's just
the drugs. He can't beat them.</i>

73
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:52,083
<i>But he needs you, especially now.</i>

74
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,306
<i>After all these years,
you gotta know...</i>

75
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,901
<i>... under all those problems,
he's good people.</i>

76
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,543
<i>-What about you?
-I don't need love.</i>

77
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:04,975
<i>I'm looking for something else.</i>

78
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,459
Why didn't we bring Joel?

79
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:15,147
Isn't this nice, just the two of us?

80
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,031
Hey, Justin, come here.

81
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:32,017
What do you think?

82
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:34,110
When are you gonna wear that?

83
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,830
I have to take my picture
for the Health Valley contest.

84
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,137
-It's the Matt Schramm thing.
-God, Audrey.

85
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:43,193
You're very good at thinking
things are stupid.

86
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:46,207
I just wanna see if I can win.

87
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,179
Do I look stupid in this?

88
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:53,114
You're my mother.

89
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:58,179
-You're married to my father.
-Who I love. It's just a bit of fun.

90
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,649
Not for me.

91
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:05,588
Well.... Tragically, darling, you lost
your sense of humour at the age of 17.

92
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:23,295
How did you fall in love?

93
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,890
God, I don't know, Justin.

94
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:28,904
When he hurt his knee, though,
right?

95
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:34,471
Well, he was sort of an asshole
before he did.

96
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,745
But I was a brat too. I let everybody
believe I was so upset...

97
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,755
...because he wasn't
gonna play anymore.

98
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:44,852
But I kind of think
that's when I fell for him.

99
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,745
It's nice to be needed.

100
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:52,722
I don't know. It's complicated.

101
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,103
Can you help me?

102
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,629
There's a little button on this one.

103
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:01,889
Okay.

104
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:06,117
What about that?

105
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,545
You think someone like Matt
would like that?

106
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:10,847
Matt Schramm is not
gonna look at the pictures.

107
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:15,787
Justin, it's just a little fun.
It's just a little silly, ridiculous fun.

108
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,061
<i>You never even had a girlfriend.</i>

109
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:23,614
So what?

110
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:27,340
You don't even hang out with girls. You
just hang out with your nerdy friends.

111
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,768
<i>No, I do hang out with girls.</i>

112
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:32,028
<i>-Really?
-Yes.</i>

113
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,372
<i>But how come you never
bring any over here?</i>

114
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,637
<i>Or I never, lik e, see you walking
with any or anything.</i>

115
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:40,316
<i>-I see you walking by yourself.
-Why do you care, Joel?</i>

116
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:42,953
<i>I don't know, because I'm bored.</i>

117
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:47,097
Creeps. They can't take
anything seriously.

118
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,814
Yeah, I know.

119
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,916
Guys in your grade have fucked girls.
You haven't even kissed one.

120
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,186
-Leave.
-No.

121
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,413
You like that book?

122
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:02,879
Oh, yeah.

123
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,055
It's got great stuff on Greenpeace.

124
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,237
Yeah, it's a good introduction.

125
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,627
Those Greenpeace guys
are really brave.

126
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:15,813
-I wish I could do something like that.
-What?

127
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:19,288
-Be brave?
-Yeah.

128
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,473
Maybe you already are.

129
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,678
Are you gonna fuck me now?

130
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,152
When you gonna clean all your
old stuff from the garage like you said?

131
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:56,752
Right. Sorry.

132
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,142
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

133
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:19,858
Justin.

134
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,291
This is stupid.

135
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,021
Why " MFC"?

136
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,798
Michael Forrest Cobb.

137
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,016
Why your name?

138
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:40,997
I don't think you're in a position
to be asking the questions right now.

139
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:43,676
You should stop.

140
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,355
I want to.

141
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:48,448
I'm trying.

142
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,253
Well....

143
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:54,434
Don't you think I want to?

144
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,779
Things are gonna be different.

145
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,504
Why can't you trust me?

146
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,843
The Sierra Club made them
turn this back into a refuge...

147
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,439
...because it was going to be
used for a development.

148
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:16,076
How do you know so much
about the environment?

149
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:18,043
My parents were activists.

150
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:22,062
See, humans think that we're the centre
of the universe, but we're not.

151
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:24,783
I guess we're trained
to think that way.

152
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,252
Yeah. It causes a lot of problems.

153
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,392
Yeah.

154
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,741
-It's hot today.
-Yeah.

155
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:37,717
Think I'm gonna take my shirt off.

156
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,601
Yeah?

157
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,410
-Go ahead.
-You should too.

158
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:47,638
What are you trying, Justin?

159
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:50,275
No, really. We're so uptight
in our clothes.

160
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:54,503
It's just like wearing
a bathing suit at the beach.

161
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,196
No. My stomach would get sunburned
and my mom would get mad.

162
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:02,205
Your mom looks at you naked?

163
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:05,303
Well, yeah.
I mean, don't your parents?

164
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,149
Audrey? Mike? No.

165
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:11,247
Why do you call your parents
by their first name?

166
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:16,061
Mike says when I call him " Dad,"
he feels old...

167
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,907
...and I sound like a child
or something.

168
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:22,256
And when I call Audrey " Mom,"
she seems old to him.

169
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:27,614
So are you gonna
take your shirt off?

170
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,288
You?

171
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,051
Yeah.

172
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:36,766
What's " MFC"?

173
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,626
Justin?

174
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,175
Justin?

175
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,142
Nothing.

176
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:48,696
It's nothing?

177
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,672
Well, then why don't you
just tell me?

178
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,449
-Justin.
-" Motherfucking cocksucker."

179
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,602
Why you acting like this?

180
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,998
What's the point of us spending time
together if it can't lead to openness?

181
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,840
I'm sorry.

182
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,491
Maybe you should go.

183
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:21,263
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:30,807
-Should I call you?
-When you're ready to be open.

185
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,062
You don't think it's okay for me
to be worried about this?

186
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:53,118
We spent a fortune on the braces
to try and fix what he did.

187
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,132
-He's 17.
-Yeah, but he's sucking his thumb.

188
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,104
Let's see you fix it.
You seem to have all the answers.

189
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,992
I think we need to get this thing
under control, that's all.

190
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:04,085
Yeah, that's all.

191
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:30,358
It's time we were honest
with each other.

192
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,953
Yeah?

193
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,678
I don't wanna fix your teeth
all over again.

194
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:39,441
It's time to confront
the underlying issue.

195
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,371
What do you mean?

196
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:47,436
I know what your problem is.
It's an understandable habit.

197
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,199
In fact, what's strange
is that people ever quit.

198
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:52,794
It's nature's substitute
for your mother's breast.

199
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,269
How were you fed as a baby?

200
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:59,576
-From a bottle?
-I can't remember.

201
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:04,682
Any tension at home? Anxiety?

202
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:06,734
Any bad memories?

203
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:10,585
-Justin.
-Justin.

204
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,678
No conscious ones.

205
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,152
We never remember
the big things anyway.

206
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:23,184
Some babysitter holds your mouth
shut so she can watch...

207
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:27,831
...her soap operas in peace. At 40, you
wonder why you can't stay married.

208
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:32,728
There's only so much I can do
with traditional orthodontics.

209
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:34,654
Justin.

210
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:36,286
Justin.

211
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:41,184
Are you ready to let go
of your thumb?

212
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:46,082
-Why are you talking like that?
-Answer my question.

213
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,686
-What are you gonna do?
-I wanna try hypnosis.

214
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,626
-No way.
-Yeah. Really, I've seen it do wonders.

215
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,272
You just try and relax.

216
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,263
The more relaxed you are,
the deeper we can go.

217
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,448
Focus on the moon
in the painting.

218
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,658
A sense of peace...

219
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,509
...like a white light
fills your body.

220
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:29,574
Imagine the white light
filling your feet...

221
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,043
...then your legs.

222
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,639
Then your torso.

223
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:38,615
Then your head.
Imagine you're on a path.

224
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,629
You're deep in the forest.

225
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,815
A shaft of light
illuminates a wild animal.

226
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,959
This is your power animal.

227
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:51,969
See it.

228
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,894
Study it.

229
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,368
When you feel like
sucking your thumb...

230
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,424
...I want you to call on
your power animal.

231
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,350
Call it now.

232
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,275
Come here.

233
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,619
Do it in your mind.

234
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:14,029
<i>Whenever you feel afraid, alone...</i>

235
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:16,080
<i>... call on your power animal.</i>

236
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:20,098
You're not alone.
You're not afraid.

237
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:23,112
You don't need your thumb.

238
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,707
And your thumb doesn't need you.

239
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:34,582
Justin, from now on, your thumb
will taste like echinacea.

240
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:40,819
What's your power animal?

241
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:43,288
That's personal.

242
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:12,716
The mark of a secure nation is not
that conflicts are resolved quickly...

243
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,478
...but that conflicts do not arise.

244
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:18,241
Very nice, Ashley, thank you.

245
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:21,213
Next is Justin...

246
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:23,474
...with an introductory statement.

247
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,943
The North American Free Trade
Agreement.

248
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,943
All right, look over your notes.
I'll be right back.

249
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:57,505
-Mr. Cobb.
-I have to go.

250
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:59,766
-No, you have a speech to give.
-I can't stay.

251
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:02,277
-Look, what's going on?
-Don't touch me.

252
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:29,737
The Sierra Club website said
clear-cutting was up 15 percent.

253
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:31,914
Justin.

254
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,765
I think we should
write a letter together.

255
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,988
What happened in Mr. Geary's class?

256
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,923
I was just....

257
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:45,728
I had to go.

258
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:50,374
-Do you wanna write the letter?
-Why don't you just write one?

259
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:53,890
Why are you all of a sudden
so interested in this anyways?

260
00:24:54,518 --> 00:24:56,695
Because it's important.

261
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:01,174
Because people
should know this stuff, right?

262
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:02,681
Yeah.

263
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,202
So you're into getting the truth out,
being honest and open?

264
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:09,337
Yeah.

265
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:12,309
So why can't you tell me
what MFC means?

266
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:15,322
Why can't you tell me
what happened in class?

267
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,253
Because that's nothing.

268
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,620
Nothing, right.

269
00:25:29,471 --> 00:25:31,313
Goodbye, Justin.

270
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,075
Perry.

271
00:25:43,536 --> 00:25:45,964
<i>-It work ed.
-That's wonderful.</i>

272
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:50,819
No, I didn't think it would be like this.
Can you put it back or something?

273
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:53,959
Your subconscious
has taken its course.

274
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,219
Please, I really feel crazy.

275
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,894
<i>Stick with it, Justin.</i>

276
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:01,284
Call on your power animal for help.

277
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:20,456
-I'm sorry.
-What's going on, Justin?

278
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:22,884
I don't know.

279
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:25,228
It's okay. You're okay.

280
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:27,363
I'll get this.

281
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,214
This is gonna be stupid.
I thought you liked that guy.

282
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:42,851
He just pretended
to be my friend, Joel.

283
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,609
If you're scared, you can go home.

284
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,204
All right.

285
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:49,423
Joel.

286
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:54,488
I'm sorry, okay?

287
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:56,916
Perry fucked me up.

288
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:01,939
How?

289
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:03,446
He said he'd help me...

290
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,502
...and then he just
fucked me up, okay?

291
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:11,483
Joel. Just this once.

292
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,827
Please.

293
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,092
Goddamn it.

294
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,654
Mr. and Mrs. Cobb, Justin's
always shown a lot of promise.

295
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:11,300
But I feel that something comes
between him and his potential.

296
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,393
And with college just ahead...

297
00:28:13,602 --> 00:28:16,658
-...Justin needs to maximise right now.
-Yes.

298
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:22,560
-Well?
-Well, I feel that...

299
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,997
...in light of recent behaviour,
that Justin needs an adjustment.

300
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:30,597
Justin, have you ever suspected...

301
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:33,904
...that you were different
from other teenagers?

302
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:38,425
Not as patient,
can't finish what you've started.

303
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,611
Terrified of being left alone,
but angry when you feel crowded.

304
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,960
-A little.
-It's classic hyperactive teen.

305
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:49,811
Attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder. ADHD.

306
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,578
We'd like you to think about
a stimulant drug treatment for Justin.

307
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:56,341
-You mean, like Ritalin?
-That's one of the many drugs...

308
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,150
...that a doctor could prescribe.
There's Adderall, Clonidine, Tenex.

309
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,708
If this is all just coming down
to medication--

310
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:07,559
Look, I think that my son can
handle this if he puts his mind to it.

311
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,159
Mr. Geary, don't you feel that Justin
could do much better?

312
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,885
Justin has exhibited...

313
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:18,527
...some of the behaviour
that fits this particular profile.

314
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:23,968
Excuse me, these symptoms
they have here, they're pretty vague.

315
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:27,443
" Ignores information.
Makes mistakes.

316
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,419
Seems restless.
Avoids, dislikes or is reluctant...

317
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:35,145
...to engage in work that requires
sustained mental effort."

318
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:43,015
What'd you think, Justin?

319
00:29:46,154 --> 00:29:48,624
So my problems are
just because I'm hyper?

320
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:57,749
It says I'll have more confidence
and self-control.

321
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:02,395
-I'll have better relationships.
-Is that how you feel? Out of control?

322
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:05,702
It just all sounds too easy to me.
You know, take a pill, change.

323
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:07,335
What if Mrs. Wood is right?

324
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:10,726
What if the trouble was, all along,
I just can't concentrate...

325
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:13,446
...I can't focus on anything?

326
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:15,958
It just still seems too easy.

327
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:18,553
Haven't you ever wanted to change?

328
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:22,907
-Yes, I have. But it's not that simple.
-Maybe it is.

329
00:32:23,504 --> 00:32:24,760
Amazing.

330
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,644
Joel.

331
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:29,365
What happened?

332
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,504
I changed.

333
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:40,457
-What do you mean, you've changed?
-I mean, it works.

334
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,257
It really works.

335
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:45,355
<i>-Your pills?
-Yeah.</i>

336
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:48,201
<i>I never thought that I
would feel so clear.</i>

337
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:52,094
-Who'd like to talk on whiteness?
-Whiteness stands for eternity.

338
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,062
The blankness
of uninterrupted time.

339
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:57,327
It represents both innocence
and extinction.

340
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:59,001
The beginning and the end.

341
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:01,471
How are you doing
with the medication?

342
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,275
<i>-I read Moby Dick straight through.
-That's great.</i>

343
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:07,080
-But how do you feel?
-I feel...

344
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:11,015
...like me.
I never really did before.

345
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:15,159
Have you had any other breakthroughs
besides the book?

346
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,968
It used to be kind of a hassle
to put on underwear in the morning.

347
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:21,061
But now it's kind of easy.

348
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:26,419
I listened to the words
to the Pledge of Allegiance today...

349
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:28,261
...and they gave me chills.

350
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:33,075
I've always felt that you have a real
sensitivity when it comes to language.

351
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:36,968
And I know that you're smart.
I think that you see a lot more...

352
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,605
...than you take responsibility for.

353
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:42,912
That kind of perception you have,
that can't be taught by anyone.

354
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:46,386
Rebecca left the debate team.

355
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:49,274
Did she say anything to you
about why or...?

356
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,200
No.

357
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:54,758
Well, I need somebody to step up
and take her place.

358
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,065
I'd like for you to compete with us.

359
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:02,711
You think I could do it?

360
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:05,935
Yes, I do.

361
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:11,334
-What happened to Mike?
-He tried his best. He couldn't make it.

362
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:13,134
The door's up there.

363
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,437
-I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

364
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:20,711
Nervous?

365
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,055
-Something.
-Completely understandable.

366
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:26,111
This isn't a classroom situation.
And that's a whole other...

367
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,455
...new thing for you to process.

368
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,385
I wish I was bald.

369
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:34,232
-Bitch.
-Your hair seems fine.

370
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,585
-Okay, now you're making it worse.
-I'm sorry.

371
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:41,306
-Did you see the girls?
-Yeah. I saw Rene in the hall.

372
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:43,650
Okay, go round them up.
Bring them in here.

373
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,366
-It's a men's room.
-That's okay.

374
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,710
I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher.

375
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:50,766
Nothing you can do.

376
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,566
<i>Butterflies are understandable.</i>

377
00:34:52,817 --> 00:34:56,375
What I wanna do is go back to the
basics. Let's remember our posturing.

378
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,138
Breathing.

379
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,822
Rene, I really want you to use
your eye contact today.

380
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:06,798
Let me emphasise your eyes. I got
some mascara. Lose the windows.

381
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:10,189
Let's do some impromptus:
Maintenance.

382
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,036
It is important in any system
to ensure that all pieces...

383
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:17,305
...particularly the most important ones,
are working and properly maintained.

384
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:19,817
Stop on a dime. Rebuttal.

385
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:22,873
The Bill of Rights was intentionally
made by our forefathers...

386
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:25,635
...to be useful for themselves
and posterity...

387
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:28,314
-...as it says in the Declaration--
-You're a killer.

388
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:30,533
You're a stone-faced killer.

389
00:35:30,742 --> 00:35:32,919
-What's not debatable?
-Our debating.

390
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:35,179
-Line them up.
-And knock them down.

391
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:36,895
You guys are gonna do great.

392
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,207
<i>Okay. Today's topic
for spar is the media...</i>

393
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,384
<i>... with an emphasis on TV violence.</i>

394
00:35:52,928 --> 00:35:54,477
Elise Burns.

395
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:58,704
It's just sick. TV violence kills morality,
particularly among teens.

396
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:01,928
Studies prove it. Day after day,
kids watch shows with gunfights.

397
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,272
And the next thing you know,
someone's dead.

398
00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:06,783
Television is a Trojan horse
in our homes.

399
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:09,295
It claims to give us education
and entertainment...

400
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:12,769
...but it really just takes the
imaginations of today's youth hostage.

401
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,997
I agree. Media conglomerates say they
wanna change, but it's all double talk.

402
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:19,885
I mean, accountability
needs to be enforced.

403
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,811
I concur. But let's go further.

404
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,322
TV contributes to the decay
of the American family.

405
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:27,420
And once the family goes,
down goes our institutions...

406
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:30,769
...and up goes our drug abuse.
Ditto, gambling and pornography.

407
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:32,820
You have no evidence
to support that claim.

408
00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:36,755
Images aren't reality.

409
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:40,062
Violence in art goes back to Egypt.

410
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,201
What's important is teaching people
to be sceptical.

411
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:48,182
To draw a line. To distinguish
between images and life.

412
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:51,280
Lisa, what's your opinion?

413
00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:54,336
Well, you're right. TV's not real.

414
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,517
Hold on. Reality is not the point here.
Social decline is.

415
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:00,322
-Kate, reaction?
-Oh, no, go ahead.

416
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:03,210
Mark, I understand the spirit
of your refutation.

417
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:08,233
But society and its conception
of reality are inextricable.

418
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,545
Well?

419
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,470
-Did we live or die?
-You were right.

420
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,731
-I was good.
-That's great, Justin.

421
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,321
That's good to hear.

422
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:20,121
You were....

423
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:24,768
Yeah. I'd never seen you
look that way before. Yeah.

424
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,237
You grew up.

425
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,730
Passive acceptance of the impact
of genetic engineering...

426
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,488
...is itself an act of aggression.

427
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:39,586
But that's the problem.
Passive acceptance of the impact...

428
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:43,060
...of genetic engineering
is itself an act of aggression.

429
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,576
No, you should see him.

430
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:49,172
And he wears this tie.

431
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:54,488
It's important to be supportive.

432
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:57,711
And seen.

433
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:05,371
You know, it was almost easier
when he was always fucking up.

434
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:07,464
Yeah.

435
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:15,418
It's like he thinks
he's smarter than me.

436
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,371
Well, maybe that's the way it goes.

437
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:32,831
My worthy opponent.
My worthy opponent.

438
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:34,757
Isn't isolationism a bankrupt policy?

439
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,101
Isn't isolationism a bankrupt policy?

440
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:39,780
Nations no longer exist independently
of one another.

441
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:42,375
-And the name of this cell part?
-Mitochondria.

442
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:45,557
The very existence
of weapons of mass destruction...

443
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:48,319
...is in contradiction
to our idea of diplomacy.

444
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:50,412
<i>Thank you for seeing me.</i>

445
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:55,770
Well, I have a background in med surg,
but I've floated in orthopaedics.

446
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:59,705
I've always had a great interest
in psych and rehab nursing.

447
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:03,012
I think my RN skills
would be useful here.

448
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:07,282
And I've taken continuing ed.
in psych and rehab.

449
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,589
It's a thing that's
always interested me.

450
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,282
You're angry, and that's human.
But it's not a solution.

451
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:19,547
We have to overcome the idea
that everyone is the same.

452
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:25,407
Andy Smalley said
your old girlfriend's a stoner now.

453
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:27,165
Rebecca?

454
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:29,677
She hates stoners.

455
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:51,276
-Hi.
-Hello.

456
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:52,741
-Last name is Geary.
-Okay.

457
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:54,918
G as in Gerald, E-A-R-Y.

458
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:57,388
-Here it is. Two rooms.
-Great.

459
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,899
One for the boys
and one for the girls.

460
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,997
Don't you think
we should do this by age?

461
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:06,011
It's against school policy.
You can't have males with females.

462
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,811
-Thank you.
-I'll say I sneaked in.

463
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,239
-I'll take the blame.
-What's this about?

464
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,792
I just wanna be with people
my own age.

465
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:15,094
We can prepare better.

466
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:21,122
Oh, my God.

467
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:27,778
-I call my own bed.
-Which one of you is on the couch?

468
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:28,992
-You.
-You.

469
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,754
-Boys get the couch.
-Amen, sister.

470
00:40:32,006 --> 00:40:34,140
<i>And now our shocking
Access Hollywood exclusive:</i>

471
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,824
<i>TV star Matt Schramm
check ed into drug rehab today.</i>

472
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:42,177
<i>Schramm was suffering from
a $1000-a-day cocaine habit.</i>

473
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:45,777
<i>On Friday, producers of his hit show,
The Line, staged an intervention...</i>

474
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:48,331
<i>... with some of Matt's
closest family and friends.</i>

475
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,801
<i>Schramm was receptive
to their pleas....</i>

476
00:40:50,968 --> 00:40:54,024
-Anybody want any peach schnapps?
-I only drink beer.

477
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:56,577
-Yeah, me too.
-Come on.

478
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:59,800
-Maybe we can order room service.
-We're minors.

479
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:03,107
Why don't you ask Geary to get it.

480
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,205
Yeah, Justin. He'll get it if you ask.

481
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:10,935
<i>Are you putting me in a position
to buy alcohol for minors?</i>

482
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:12,651
People do it all the time.

483
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:16,126
Yes, I can understand
that you guys wanna unwind a little.

484
00:41:16,293 --> 00:41:17,591
You've worked hard...

485
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,605
...and you'd like to enjoy yourselves.

486
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:22,530
<i>But I am a teacher.</i>

487
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:26,674
We think of you more as a peer.
A friend.

488
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:31,111
<i>That's the line you're gonna use?
I hope your head's better tomorrow.</i>

489
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:34,083
<i>Don't k eep me on.
You'll talk yourself out of a six-pack.</i>

490
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:39,400
I thought about it.
I don't think it's a good idea.

491
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:43,209
You should be doing your impromptus
and getting ready for the meet.

492
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,925
What?

493
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:50,074
-Here's your six-pack.
-That's messed up.

494
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:52,962
One is gonna go a long way
with the pills you're on.

495
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:57,148
-So go slow, okay? Have fun.
-I understand. Thank you.

496
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:02,380
-Line them up.
-And knock them down.

497
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,534
Make room. Okay.

498
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:11,464
It's all wet now. Take it off.

499
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:13,976
Where did this go?

500
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,813
Oh, my.

501
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:27,412
Wait, I think that's your--

502
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,561
Guys. Oh, guys.

503
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,701
-Are you okay?
-Shit.

504
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:39,677
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

505
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:40,933
Oh, my God. Shit.

506
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,738
Why am I getting a call
from the front desk?

507
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,082
We were just having a normal time.

508
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:48,175
Do you think I'm stupid?

509
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:50,477
You're not stupid.

510
00:42:50,686 --> 00:42:53,658
You just feel left out,
and I can understand that.

511
00:42:53,868 --> 00:42:55,668
You see us having fun
and you feel alone.

512
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:58,389
But that doesn't mean that we were
doing anything wrong.

513
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:00,858
Look, Kevin.

514
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:04,249
Your pro-disarmament views
do not reflect the international climate.

515
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,430
They just reflect your need
for everything to be nice.

516
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,853
To be friendly.

517
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:11,951
-But humans are inherently hostile.
-You're missing my point.

518
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:14,504
I don't think you know
what your point really is.

519
00:43:14,714 --> 00:43:17,267
If we're to take disarmament seriously,
I propose that...

520
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,695
...we look at the real weapons.

521
00:43:19,904 --> 00:43:21,537
Our minds.

522
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,672
How do you feel?

523
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:37,318
Tired. But good.

524
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:39,578
Why do you feel good?

525
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:42,132
Because I'm winning.

526
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:46,192
-What about learning?
-I'm learning how to win.

527
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:50,755
You're so hungry, Justin.

528
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,559
I never really took that into account.

529
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,680
Here he goes, Mr. Lightning Dealer.

530
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,648
-Hey.
-Hey.

531
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:07,499
Yeah. Another Cobb success story
on our hands.

532
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,675
Let me see that thing.

533
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:14,238
-First.
-It's something, huh?

534
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:16,164
That is something.

535
00:44:20,936 --> 00:44:23,824
How would you know?
You don't even show up.

536
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,712
I work.

537
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:33,326
Actually, I have some news.

538
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:37,135
I'm being transferred
to the Maple Glen facility.

539
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:38,935
-The celebrity rehab place.
-Yeah.

540
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,531
I went today
for the introduction session.

541
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,707
-This was in the works?
-Yeah.

542
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:46,261
It's actually a pretty big promotion.

543
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,270
So did you see any celebrities?

544
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,907
-It's not just for celebrities.
-Right.

545
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:54,340
-Well, you seem happy.
-Yeah.

546
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:56,516
Yeah? That's great.

547
00:44:56,726 --> 00:45:00,409
So who'd you see? Matthew Perry?
Whitney Houston? Robert Downey Jr.?

548
00:45:00,619 --> 00:45:03,465
You know, I signed an agreement.
I'm can't leak names.

549
00:45:03,674 --> 00:45:08,237
-But you can tell us. We're your family.
-Well, I can't. I'm sorry.

550
00:45:08,488 --> 00:45:09,786
Come on.

551
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:13,846
They're my patients, people with
problems. I'm there to help them.

552
00:45:15,353 --> 00:45:18,744
So now these celebrities
are more important than your family.

553
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:21,716
Justin.

554
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:25,692
I think working at Maple Glen
is a bad idea.

555
00:45:27,785 --> 00:45:30,255
Well, I don't think I asked you.

556
00:45:30,674 --> 00:45:32,139
I just won the regionals.

557
00:45:32,348 --> 00:45:35,278
I come home, you can't say
what celebrities you're working with?

558
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:38,041
-Hey, easy.
-I'm done.

559
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,111
-I'm out too.
-Where you going?

560
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:11,110
I'm just afraid places like that
pamper to those big star egos.

561
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:15,422
I mean, statistics show most addicts
don't recover anyway.

562
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:17,222
What statistics?

563
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:21,449
-I read it.
-Well, we're not having a debate.

564
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:23,333
This is my life.

565
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,301
You found something
to make you happy.

566
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,142
Let me be happy.

567
00:46:28,147 --> 00:46:30,198
What happened
to that Health Valley contest?

568
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:32,752
God, Justin. Nothing.

569
00:46:35,138 --> 00:46:36,937
You must have heard by now.

570
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:39,282
You know,
it's none of your business.

571
00:46:39,491 --> 00:46:42,882
It was just a distraction.
It was something to do.

572
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:13,690
My grades...

573
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:16,955
...are below your standards.

574
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:20,639
But I see this as....
As a strength.

575
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:22,774
Not a weakness.

576
00:47:23,025 --> 00:47:25,285
I've had to overcome....

577
00:47:25,536 --> 00:47:27,336
Overcome. Overcome...

578
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:29,011
...unusual obstacles.

579
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:34,453
Both my parents....

580
00:47:36,546 --> 00:47:38,429
Both my parents...

581
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:44,080
...suffer from mental illness.

582
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,392
It's made my life difficult.

583
00:47:48,643 --> 00:47:50,317
Mental illness.

584
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,461
This has made my life difficult.
But also...

585
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,517
...given me a valuable perspective.

586
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:00,531
I would like...

587
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:05,010
...to apply this sensitivity
to a career in TV journalism.

588
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:09,238
I wanna show the world
what's really happening...

589
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:12,838
...the way I've had to with my family.

590
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:17,066
I just can't deal with him right now.

591
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:18,740
<i>Well, you two are arguing.</i>

592
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:21,084
Oh, he can be such
a little shit sometimes.

593
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:22,717
<i>Easy.</i>

594
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:24,977
He doesn't need anybody to go.

595
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:29,163
<i>-Isn't it the state finals or something?
-He'll be fine.</i>

596
00:48:30,796 --> 00:48:33,935
<i>-Oh, I'll go.
-No, you don't have to do that.</i>

597
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:36,907
No, I wanna see him.

598
00:48:37,158 --> 00:48:41,386
-Really?
-God. Yeah, I'll go.

599
00:48:52,814 --> 00:48:55,200
That's $3.20. Thanks a lot.

600
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:00,432
Perry.

601
00:49:02,483 --> 00:49:03,823
You look different.

602
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:07,632
-Nice tie.
-Debate team.

603
00:49:07,883 --> 00:49:10,395
I've been meaning to call you.
I owe you an apology.

604
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:14,413
I've been meaning to call you too.
I wanted to thank you.

605
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:16,506
Really?

606
00:49:16,716 --> 00:49:20,441
I was lost in a cloud
of hippie psychobabble.

607
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:23,580
You helped bring me
back down to earth.

608
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,097
I've rewritten my whole philosophy
of life.

609
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:30,948
Found new answers
to my questions.

610
00:49:32,245 --> 00:49:34,087
Yeah, me too.

611
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:37,603
There's no try. There's only do.

612
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:40,743
That's something that I've learned.

613
00:49:40,952 --> 00:49:42,041
What do you think?

614
00:49:46,227 --> 00:49:47,482
How's your dad?

615
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:52,045
-He's fine. Same.
-Your mom?

616
00:49:53,008 --> 00:49:56,984
She's got a new job
working with drug addicts.

617
00:49:58,031 --> 00:49:59,412
And what about your thumb?

618
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,263
Have you been sucking it?

619
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,691
Actually, I was diagnosed
with attention deficit disorder.

620
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,040
It's a real problem.
Now I'm on medication.

621
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:20,258
I was just concerned.

622
00:50:21,263 --> 00:50:22,896
Well, I'm better.

623
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:28,170
I'm leading the team
at the state debates tomorrow.

624
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:30,263
Medication, huh?

625
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:32,230
Yeah, I feel great.

626
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:34,700
Euphoric, even?

627
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,225
Aren't you just my orthodontist?

628
00:50:40,895 --> 00:50:43,239
I like to think of myself...

629
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:45,249
...as more than that.

630
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,811
Take care, Justin.

631
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:08,439
-What are you doing?
-No wonder. This stuff's just speed.

632
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,490
-It calms me down.
-That's what they say.

633
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:13,462
But you focus. Three molecules
different than cocaine.

634
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:14,885
A doctor gave it to me.

635
00:51:15,094 --> 00:51:18,150
I saw the special on PBS.
Teachers are overmedicating kids--

636
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:21,415
TV is a great source
for our information, isn't it?

637
00:51:22,043 --> 00:51:23,927
Whatever, speed freak.

638
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,336
<i>I think you're confusing tone
and content.</i>

639
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:35,145
I mean, tone has tone,
but content is silent.

640
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:37,866
Silent?

641
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:41,675
It's not quite silent.
It's just that the tone is muted.

642
00:51:41,926 --> 00:51:44,438
A tone that you shouldn't hear
in the content.

643
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:48,498
-You're missing the point.
-Look, if silence is neutral...

644
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:51,136
...then the tone...

645
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:52,977
...will be quieter.

646
00:51:53,187 --> 00:51:57,163
And the content
would be neutral but heard.

647
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,963
What are you saying?

648
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,461
Hey.

649
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,679
-Finally got to see you.
-Don't patronise me.

650
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:12,861
Come on, I'm just trying to say
something, you know?

651
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,037
I think I'm gonna quit
the debate team.

652
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:17,005
-You were doing well.
-Too much pressure.

653
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:18,554
-It's no reason to quit.
-Mike.

654
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:20,144
What?

655
00:52:21,442 --> 00:52:23,200
You're not helping.

656
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:28,014
Well, you should....

657
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:31,195
-What am I supposed to say?
-I don't know.

658
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:36,051
All right, come on. Let's go home.
Come on.

659
00:52:37,474 --> 00:52:38,730
Come on.

660
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,000
<i>Justin, it's...</i>

661
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:47,102
...in my professional opinion
that you've become a monster.

662
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:49,572
What?

663
00:52:50,744 --> 00:52:54,930
-You used to love me.
-Don't get grandiose with this.

664
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:57,064
What was that all about my gift?

665
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,948
And you told me--

666
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:01,753
You built it up.
You told me I had a talent.

667
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:03,971
Yeah, you do.
You have a real intensity.

668
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,818
You have a great understanding
of group dynamics.

669
00:53:07,027 --> 00:53:09,999
But there's also a lot of things
that you need to work on, Justin.

670
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:14,269
Like glibness,
arrogance, self-control.

671
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:16,529
Shall I go on?

672
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:18,580
At least I still have a dream.

673
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,013
Well, that's great.

674
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:25,068
Is that how you see me?

675
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:28,836
That's what we've come to, Justin?

676
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:31,682
I already decided.
I'm quitting the debate team.

677
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:38,087
That's my fault.

678
00:53:42,356 --> 00:53:44,198
Thank you very much.

679
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:49,263
Good luck to you.

680
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,187
You look terrible.

681
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:14,029
You okay?

682
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:18,508
-I'm not sick.
-Let me see.

683
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,196
I stopped taking my pills.

684
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:25,875
They're just speed.

685
00:55:27,884 --> 00:55:31,359
They're just three molecules
different than cocaine.

686
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:37,052
You know, it's not good for you
to quit cold turkey.

687
00:55:37,303 --> 00:55:38,852
But I can.

688
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,539
What?

689
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:13,218
I need to talk to you.

690
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:16,483
Come in.

691
00:56:22,176 --> 00:56:23,558
What's up?

692
00:56:28,372 --> 00:56:31,344
How did you feel
when you had to quit football?

693
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,664
Horrible.

694
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:41,641
-How did you deal with it?
-You have to, you know, tough it out.

695
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:44,320
You know, tough it out.

696
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:46,204
-Mike.
-What?

697
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:51,269
-I just thought you could help for once.
-Hey, I help.

698
00:56:51,478 --> 00:56:52,901
Then how did you do it?

699
00:56:55,957 --> 00:57:00,143
Why can't you ever tell me anything
about how you deal with things?

700
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,719
-Hey, Justin.
-Hey. How's it going?

701
00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:29,989
-So I hear you're the debate star now.
-Not anymore.

702
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:34,133
-You look the same.
-You don't.

703
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:36,184
Not really.

704
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:39,449
-I need to talk to you.
-Look, Justin, I'm sorry.

705
00:57:39,658 --> 00:57:41,877
-I just don't wanna--
-No, not that.

706
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:44,891
Did you ever feel like...?

707
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,863
Like you really wanted to...

708
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:50,626
...I don't know, change?

709
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:55,147
Maybe.

710
00:57:55,523 --> 00:57:57,616
Why are you telling this to me?

711
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:02,263
Do you have any pot?
I heard you were doing it.

712
00:58:02,472 --> 00:58:04,104
Gossip.

713
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,532
It's true, though, right?

714
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:10,132
What, you want me to get you high?

715
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,686
Yeah. Maybe.

716
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:15,783
Really?

717
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:33,239
-Hey.
-Hi.

718
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,839
I finally found this.
I didn't know which house it was.

719
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,318
Are you stoned right now?

720
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:45,545
You don't make a big deal out of it.

721
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:48,811
You still want some, right?

722
00:58:49,648 --> 00:58:51,322
Yeah.

723
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,210
You're not still all weird, are you?

724
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,596
I wasn't weird.

725
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:58,648
Really?

726
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,289
Suck.

727
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,508
Suck.

728
00:59:11,122 --> 00:59:12,838
It gets easier.

729
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:20,875
Did you just give that to him
for free?

730
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:25,270
I would've made him pay.

731
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:31,340
Do you want some?

732
00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:33,642
Yeah.

733
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:36,865
Tell me the boys...

734
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,168
...who have assne.

735
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,651
-Have what?
-Assne.

736
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:47,498
Ass acne.

737
00:59:47,707 --> 00:59:50,888
I'm sure that you've seen them
in your P.E. class.

738
00:59:56,665 --> 00:59:58,381
Billy Rydell.

739
01:00:02,693 --> 01:00:04,576
Mike Green.

740
01:00:05,707 --> 01:00:08,553
Rian Stevenson. Brent Bregman.

741
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:16,004
Brent.

742
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:49,952
" I will not compare my insides
to others' outsides."

743
01:01:02,845 --> 01:01:04,645
-What's that?
-Nothing.

744
01:01:04,854 --> 01:01:08,454
-No, it's something. What is it?
-It's nothing. Don't hassle me.

745
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,719
You better get moving.
Audrey's working nights now--

746
01:01:11,928 --> 01:01:14,314
She's sleeping.
She doesn't even care.

747
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:23,231
I don't know what
the two of you are thinking.

748
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:32,021
What's your problem?

749
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:35,119
-Nothing.
-Right.

750
01:01:38,844 --> 01:01:41,230
I think my mom's having an affair.

751
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,532
Are you sure?

752
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:46,337
Pretty sure.

753
01:02:01,323 --> 01:02:03,374
You could see it coming.

754
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:06,806
Anybody could see it coming.

755
01:02:07,058 --> 01:02:08,983
Don't be so serious.

756
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:11,537
Here.

757
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:13,295
What?

758
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:19,239
-We're gonna play a game.
-What kind of a game?

759
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:22,336
You'll see.

760
01:02:23,132 --> 01:02:25,476
Well, actually, you won't.

761
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,033
No, no, no.

762
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:58,419
Just touch, don't look, okay?

763
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:00,638
Why?

764
01:03:01,768 --> 01:03:04,782
Because those are the rules,
all right?

765
01:03:23,786 --> 01:03:25,586
How was work?

766
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:31,112
How was work?

767
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:34,293
It was really good, actually.

768
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:37,098
It was really good.

769
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:40,028
Doesn't it get depressing?

770
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:44,088
Seeing all those people who have
everything just throw it all away?

771
01:03:44,297 --> 01:03:47,144
No. It's humbling.

772
01:03:48,148 --> 01:03:50,995
Last night, this guy said to me:

773
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,590
" I was born...

774
01:03:53,799 --> 01:03:56,102
...addicted to fantasy."

775
01:04:03,846 --> 01:04:06,064
<i>Doing great, ma'am.
Push, okay? Push.</i>

776
01:04:06,315 --> 01:04:07,822
<i>We gotta ditch this wetback.</i>

777
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:10,501
<i>Hey. There are no wetbacks out here.
Just people.</i>

778
01:04:15,232 --> 01:04:18,245
<i>-At least fire back.
-You know I don't use my gun.</i>

779
01:04:29,087 --> 01:04:31,808
-No.
-Just do it.

780
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:34,320
Let me tell you something.

781
01:04:47,045 --> 01:04:49,222
Do you think Justin's had sex?

782
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:52,152
That's just the image
I want in my head right now.

783
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:55,835
Because we weren't much older
when we got married.

784
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,161
How old do you feel?

785
01:05:10,947 --> 01:05:14,212
You have to tell me.
What's her pussy feel like?

786
01:05:14,421 --> 01:05:17,602
-That's gross, Joel.
-You're such a prude.

787
01:05:17,854 --> 01:05:21,579
-No. I care about her.
-I heard it's the softest thing ever.

788
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,523
-I French-kissed a girl once.
-Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

789
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:33,676
-That's not French-kissing a girl.
-Yeah? Then what is it?

790
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:35,686
A guy and a girl take their tongues...

791
01:05:35,895 --> 01:05:38,155
...and they put them inside
each other's mouths...

792
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:40,332
...and they move them around
just like this.

793
01:05:49,165 --> 01:05:50,964
This thing bugs me.

794
01:05:51,174 --> 01:05:52,764
Justin.

795
01:05:53,602 --> 01:05:55,527
No, seriously.

796
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:58,248
Why can't I see you?

797
01:05:58,499 --> 01:06:01,262
Because I told you,
those are the rules.

798
01:06:02,811 --> 01:06:04,862
But why do you get to make up
all the rules?

799
01:06:06,118 --> 01:06:09,550
Why don't you tell other people
that we're in a relationship?

800
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:13,150
We're not in a relationship, Justin.

801
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,080
Why not?

802
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,340
Rebecca...

803
01:06:28,806 --> 01:06:30,061
...I love you.

804
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,866
God, you always have to make
everything so serious.

805
01:06:33,075 --> 01:06:36,298
This was just a teenage experiment,
that's all.

806
01:06:36,508 --> 01:06:38,433
An experiment?

807
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:44,419
I needed to educate myself, Justin.

808
01:06:46,428 --> 01:06:48,019
So...

809
01:06:51,368 --> 01:06:55,135
...I decided to pick someone
like you.

810
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:57,772
Like me?

811
01:07:00,535 --> 01:07:03,172
Someone I'd never get hurt by.

812
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:09,660
That's just so fucked up.

813
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,479
Yeah, I'm sorry.

814
01:07:17,195 --> 01:07:20,544
I'm really, really sorry.

815
01:07:22,177 --> 01:07:24,521
But maybe you should just go.

816
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,167
Go, Justin.

817
01:08:03,743 --> 01:08:05,250
Hey.

818
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:06,841
There you are.

819
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,687
You're supposed to help me
clean the garage. Come on.

820
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:11,864
Come here.

821
01:08:12,073 --> 01:08:13,873
You missed dinner.

822
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:23,878
Why you acting so strange?

823
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:29,236
She just pretends to like us.

824
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:34,008
-What are you talking about?
-She just wants to have fun.

825
01:08:34,217 --> 01:08:38,654
-You wanna be so serious.
-Oh, I make everything so serious?

826
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:43,091
She's not happy.

827
01:08:45,184 --> 01:08:46,942
You know, fuck--

828
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,700
I know.

829
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:53,389
-Then why don't you do something?
-What can I do?

830
01:08:54,519 --> 01:08:58,161
The whole fucking world
expected me to go pro.

831
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,091
She doesn't care about that.

832
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:05,151
Well, she'd never admit it,
but how could she have...?

833
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:07,579
Not been disappointed.

834
01:09:07,788 --> 01:09:09,714
Everybody was.

835
01:09:10,844 --> 01:09:14,402
-You hurt your knee.
-Yeah, right.

836
01:09:16,076 --> 01:09:20,388
But what if it wasn't that bad, huh?
What if I could've kept on playing?

837
01:09:20,597 --> 01:09:23,276
What if your mother
was more important?

838
01:09:28,634 --> 01:09:30,560
Pizza in the kitchen.

839
01:09:30,769 --> 01:09:32,737
Go have your dinner.

840
01:09:37,592 --> 01:09:40,815
You know why she
got that job, right?

841
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,401
What are you doing?

842
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,387
I found a picture.

843
01:10:16,187 --> 01:10:18,238
A picture of that guy.

844
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,791
Do you know about this?

845
01:10:28,117 --> 01:10:29,791
I'm sorry.

846
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:39,335
You'd think she'd have better taste
than this Matt Schramm guy. Jesus.

847
01:10:44,233 --> 01:10:46,158
Dresses well.

848
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:50,637
Well, you know...

849
01:10:52,437 --> 01:10:54,405
...it's all out there...

850
01:10:55,786 --> 01:10:57,921
...in picture land.

851
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:01,521
You know, I can't reach that.

852
01:11:02,735 --> 01:11:04,660
I can't.

853
01:11:11,232 --> 01:11:15,083
The only way somebody like me
could ever get her attention...

854
01:11:15,293 --> 01:11:17,679
...was by being her kid.

855
01:12:54,918 --> 01:12:57,765
Stay away from the window, man.

856
01:12:59,607 --> 01:13:02,202
You're gonna get us busted
for curfew.

857
01:13:06,304 --> 01:13:09,109
Can't even smoke in peace
around here, huh?

858
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,625
Hey, a guy can only kick
one thing at a time, right?

859
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:14,383
Come on.

860
01:13:16,978 --> 01:13:18,443
So, what, you in juvie?

861
01:13:19,657 --> 01:13:21,248
Yeah.

862
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:23,425
What's your poison?

863
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:26,690
-Dope.
-What flavour?

864
01:13:26,899 --> 01:13:29,118
I don't know. Everything, I guess.

865
01:13:29,327 --> 01:13:33,094
Welcome to the fucking club.
Never met a drug I didn't like.

866
01:13:35,648 --> 01:13:37,155
Yeah, she's a tough one.

867
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,680
In fact, I consider her
my guardian angel.

868
01:13:43,224 --> 01:13:45,066
Are you friends?

869
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:49,168
It's deeper than that.

870
01:13:49,336 --> 01:13:52,559
A month or so ago, I fly in here.
I work in TV.

871
01:13:52,768 --> 01:13:54,568
My studio commits me.

872
01:13:54,778 --> 01:13:57,247
<i>Maybe you've seen my show.
The Line?</i>

873
01:13:58,545 --> 01:14:01,182
You know, sometimes
you gotta cross it.

874
01:14:01,391 --> 01:14:02,689
I don't know.

875
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:07,461
Anyway. So, naturally,
I smuggle in a stash, right?

876
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,512
Tucked up my ass.

877
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:12,903
But it's too high up.
I can't get to it. So...

878
01:14:13,531 --> 01:14:15,498
...I take a spoon.

879
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:17,800
Something goes wrong.
There's blood everywhere.

880
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:18,972
That's a lot of blood.

881
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,228
And there's Cobb there.

882
01:14:20,814 --> 01:14:22,237
<i>She runs into my room.</i>

883
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:23,410
Okay.

884
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:27,972
<i>Sticks her hand in there.
No Vaseline, just my blood.</i>

885
01:14:28,182 --> 01:14:29,647
There it is. There it is.

886
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:36,428
-That's heavy, right?
-That's sick.

887
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:38,312
Yeah.

888
01:14:42,372 --> 01:14:44,507
<i>She saved my life, though.</i>

889
01:14:45,218 --> 01:14:48,316
And that was the moment
I finally got real about myself.

890
01:14:49,321 --> 01:14:50,786
I'm Matt.

891
01:14:50,995 --> 01:14:52,962
And I'm an addict.

892
01:14:55,432 --> 01:14:58,027
The other night she said to me,
"We're all addicted--"

893
01:14:58,237 --> 01:15:00,874
--to something. Maybe an idea...

894
01:15:01,586 --> 01:15:05,018
...of ourselves or our lives.

895
01:15:05,185 --> 01:15:10,836
Maybe some idea of success
or failure.

896
01:15:11,046 --> 01:15:12,595
What, you're scared too?

897
01:15:13,641 --> 01:15:16,027
Being the mother of a 17-year-old
is a trip.

898
01:15:16,236 --> 01:15:18,455
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

899
01:15:19,376 --> 01:15:23,101
You're supposed to have all the
answers, and you don't have one.

900
01:15:25,194 --> 01:15:30,217
Even the idea that once you have a
family, you'll never be lonely again.

901
01:15:31,264 --> 01:15:32,813
Heavy, huh?

902
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,878
We don't like to admit it...

903
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:40,473
...but we're all just...

904
01:15:41,394 --> 01:15:43,654
...scared little animals.

905
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,482
Hey, it was good to share.

906
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:00,398
-You okay?
-Yeah.

907
01:16:03,914 --> 01:16:04,961
That's patchouli.

908
01:16:07,138 --> 01:16:08,561
Cool.

909
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:11,658
So I'll leave you here.

910
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:13,751
-You okay?
-Yeah.

911
01:16:15,426 --> 01:16:17,351
You sure? You okay?

912
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:19,068
Yeah.

913
01:16:49,876 --> 01:16:51,551
What?

914
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:54,272
Nothing.

915
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:56,616
Ass.

916
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:58,709
Be quiet.

917
01:17:04,109 --> 01:17:05,281
Joel.

918
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,755
Yeah?

919
01:17:11,392 --> 01:17:15,536
I always kind of thought
Audrey was gonna leave Mike.

920
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,634
They couldn't be apart.

921
01:17:20,559 --> 01:17:22,443
But is that love?

922
01:17:22,903 --> 01:17:24,620
I don't know.

923
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,680
Well, don't you ever think about this
stuff? Doesn't it ever freak you out?

924
01:17:28,889 --> 01:17:31,192
Everything freaks you out.

925
01:17:32,573 --> 01:17:34,624
You don't even care.

926
01:17:35,043 --> 01:17:37,303
You have it so easy, Joel.

927
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:42,159
-I hate it when you say shit like that.
-Like what?

928
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,252
Like you're the only one
with problems.

929
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:46,722
You ever think
maybe you're so busy being weird...

930
01:17:46,931 --> 01:17:48,898
...that I have to step up
and be normal?

931
01:17:49,777 --> 01:17:51,577
Everyone's worried about you.

932
01:17:51,787 --> 01:17:54,884
All the bullshit
you get yourself into.

933
01:17:56,307 --> 01:17:59,070
Why didn't you ever
just say anything?

934
01:18:05,558 --> 01:18:07,275
I'm sorry.

935
01:18:18,577 --> 01:18:19,916
<i>Justin.</i>

936
01:18:20,084 --> 01:18:23,098
-Yeah?
-Can you come here a minute?

937
01:18:36,744 --> 01:18:38,753
-Oh, no way.
-What?

938
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:42,353
I got in.

939
01:18:42,772 --> 01:18:44,362
You applied?

940
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,399
Yeah.

941
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:59,892
Well, you didn't tell us
about this, huh?

942
01:19:01,232 --> 01:19:03,492
I thought you'd talk me out of it.

943
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,259
Oh, honey, I wouldn't have
talked you out of it. I just....

944
01:19:07,511 --> 01:19:10,273
I thought your grades....

945
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:17,348
I'm happy.

946
01:19:22,036 --> 01:19:23,585
Are you?

947
01:19:23,794 --> 01:19:26,975
Am I happy? You kidding?

948
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:37,147
Well, what does it mean?

949
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,533
It means I wanna go.

950
01:19:42,212 --> 01:19:43,635
Just like that?

951
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,273
They want me to go
to their summer-school thing.

952
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:51,924
They want me to make up some math
and language credits this summer.

953
01:20:04,272 --> 01:20:07,998
I was just getting used to you.

954
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:23,653
I gotta go deal with this shipment.

955
01:20:58,397 --> 01:21:01,076
You know I'm happy for you.

956
01:21:02,876 --> 01:21:06,392
I am. It's just....

957
01:21:08,192 --> 01:21:09,950
I don't know.

958
01:21:13,382 --> 01:21:16,731
If it was Belgium...

959
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:20,247
...or Chile...

960
01:21:20,457 --> 01:21:22,382
...or Mars.

961
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:26,568
Somewhere I couldn't picture you.

962
01:21:26,777 --> 01:21:29,122
You'd just vanish.

963
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:32,638
But New York...

964
01:21:33,182 --> 01:21:35,317
...I can see you.

965
01:21:37,075 --> 01:21:40,675
Justin in Central Park
by the fountain.

966
01:21:42,307 --> 01:21:45,070
Justin in a taxi on Fifth Avenue.

967
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:49,214
Justin at Times Square.

968
01:21:49,423 --> 01:21:53,819
Justin eating a fucking hot dog
from a street vendor.

969
01:21:56,288 --> 01:21:58,423
You can always come to visit me.

970
01:22:00,642 --> 01:22:02,316
Yeah.

971
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:05,581
Yeah.

972
01:22:06,921 --> 01:22:09,139
You're already gone.

973
01:22:10,228 --> 01:22:13,576
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

974
01:22:21,948 --> 01:22:24,334
I know you, Justin.

975
01:22:26,385 --> 01:22:29,651
I've been watching you
your whole life.

976
01:22:31,869 --> 01:22:33,041
You have?

977
01:23:01,589 --> 01:23:03,138
Justin.

978
01:23:03,348 --> 01:23:05,147
Perry.

979
01:23:05,775 --> 01:23:07,492
You found me.

980
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:10,003
Yeah, in the phone book.

981
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,268
To what do I deserve this honour?

982
01:23:13,603 --> 01:23:15,110
I'm leaving.

983
01:23:15,277 --> 01:23:18,584
-New York.
-Big city.

984
01:23:22,812 --> 01:23:25,952
-What happened?
-What do you mean?

985
01:23:26,538 --> 01:23:29,677
This place,
it looks a little depressing.

986
01:23:30,263 --> 01:23:32,231
I don't know, I....

987
01:23:32,859 --> 01:23:35,747
I guess I stopped trying
to be anything.

988
01:23:35,956 --> 01:23:39,849
I accepted myself
and all my human disorder.

989
01:23:44,328 --> 01:23:46,588
You might wanna do the same.

990
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:54,081
Remember when you were
like 13 or something, you were....

991
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:57,723
You were always doing an impression
of a newsman.

992
01:23:57,932 --> 01:23:59,774
I did?

993
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,286
You were quite good.

994
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:05,593
-Sorry.
-No.

995
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,895
If that's what you wanna do...

996
01:24:08,314 --> 01:24:11,034
...New York is the perfect place
for you.

997
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:15,053
Make the contacts, knock on doors.

998
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:19,951
Get the right haircut,
take voice lessons.

999
01:24:20,285 --> 01:24:22,127
Might work.

1000
01:24:22,964 --> 01:24:24,513
But then again...

1001
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:28,197
...you'll have to deal
with a lot of fear.

1002
01:24:29,285 --> 01:24:31,378
I just came here for a check-up.

1003
01:24:32,885 --> 01:24:34,434
Really?

1004
01:24:38,955 --> 01:24:41,676
Justin, I'm sorry if I contributed
to feelings of shame...

1005
01:24:41,885 --> 01:24:44,145
...you may have had
about your thumb.

1006
01:24:45,485 --> 01:24:47,662
I've been reading up on it.

1007
01:24:47,955 --> 01:24:51,555
Medically, psychologically...

1008
01:24:51,806 --> 01:24:55,113
...there's nothing really
wrong with thumbsucking.

1009
01:24:55,364 --> 01:24:58,252
-I don't think I can agree with that.
-No, really.

1010
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:01,350
Look, Justin...

1011
01:25:01,559 --> 01:25:03,945
...there was nothing wrong with you.

1012
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,336
It felt like everything
was wrong with me.

1013
01:25:09,345 --> 01:25:11,773
That's because we all
want to be problemless.

1014
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:15,959
To fix ourselves. We look for some
magic solution to make us all better.

1015
01:25:16,168 --> 01:25:19,056
But none of us really know
what we're doing.

1016
01:25:19,559 --> 01:25:22,028
And why is that so bad?

1017
01:25:22,489 --> 01:25:24,917
That's all we humans can do.

1018
01:25:25,545 --> 01:25:26,758
Guess.

1019
01:25:26,968 --> 01:25:28,475
Try.

1020
01:25:28,684 --> 01:25:30,484
Hope.

1021
01:25:33,582 --> 01:25:35,884
Justin, I just pray
you don't fool yourself...

1022
01:25:36,051 --> 01:25:38,521
...into thinking
you've got the answer.

1023
01:25:41,074 --> 01:25:43,209
Because that's bullshit.

1024
01:25:44,674 --> 01:25:46,642
The trick...

1025
01:25:47,102 --> 01:25:49,572
...is living without an answer.

1026
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,223
I think.

1027
01:26:01,921 --> 01:26:03,176
I think.

1028
01:26:51,985 --> 01:26:56,547
There is new evidence indicating
that the North Koreans have....

1029
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:49,081
Hi.

1030
01:27:50,462 --> 01:27:52,179
Hi.

1031
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:54,941
I'm Justin.

1032
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,783
Hi.
