1
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:21,007
I always worry that maybe people
aren't gonna like me when I go to a party.

2
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:23,443
Isn't that crazy?

3
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:29,982
Do you ever get kind of a sick feeling in the
pit of your stomach when you dread things?

4
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:33,488
I wouldn't wanna miss a party,
but every time I go to one...

5
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:37,526
...I keep feeling like
the whole world's against me.

6
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:41,029
See, I've spent my whole life
in military academies.

7
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:44,134
My mother doesn't have a place for me
where she lives...

8
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:46,827
...and she doesn't know
what else to do with me.

9
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:51,772
You mustn't misunderstand about my mother.
She's really a lovely person.

10
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:56,505
I guess every boy thinks his mother
is beautiful, but my mother really is.

11
00:01:56,681 --> 00:02:01,311
She tells me in every letter she writes how
sorry she is that we're not together more...

12
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:04,683
...but she has to think of her work.

13
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:08,815
One time we were together, though.
She met me in San Francisco once...

14
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:13,897
...and we were together for two whole
days, just like we were sweethearts.

15
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:17,899
It was the most wonderful time I ever had.

16
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,563
Then I had to go back
to the military academy.

17
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:27,041
Every time I walk into that barracks,
I get a kind of...

18
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,381
A kind of a...

19
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,925
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:51,901
Kind of a depressed feeling.

21
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,006
It's got hard, stone walls.
You know what I mean?

22
00:02:56,608 --> 00:03:00,237
I guess I've bored you enough,
telling you about myself.

23
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,441
Thank you.

24
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:07,915
Sorry about that. I goofed up the last
couple of lines. I guess I'm nervous.

25
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,120
That's okay. You did very well.

26
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,565
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:52,392
Thank you. You play very well.

28
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:57,763
Now Mrs. Tossoff's gonna play some notes
for you. Sing them back to us. Like so:

29
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:06,333
- It's too low for me.
- You're a tenor? You want to start here?

30
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:11,312
Louder, please.

31
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:51,288
I'm so nervous.

32
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,822
- I'm not singing.
- But you have to.

33
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,290
- But I came to dance.
- You have to sing too.

34
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,895
- And act, and play an instrument.
- All three?

35
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:02,124
- It says "performing arts," doesn't it?
- You don't have to do everything.

36
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:08,239
- Sure as shit helps, baby.
- Thank you. The next group, please. Hurry.

37
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,466
- Oh, I like your nose ring.
- I'm into culture.

38
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:15,806
- Does that hurt, or is that ethnic?
- Music, please, Mrs. Snell.

39
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:19,781
Please pay attention.
We have a lot to do today.

40
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:25,756
- I hate my legs.
- Yeah. Me too.

41
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:29,893
- I've tried every diet in the whole world.
- Really? Me too.

42
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:34,925
But you can't help your glands.
I'm sorry! I'm just so nervous.

43
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,160
Relax! Come on, use your body.

44
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:51,543
- Careful. That's 7000 worth of machine.
- Dollars or pounds?

45
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:55,243
Don't touch the rotary pods.
I got it set on saw-tooth.

46
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,050
Why can't he play the piccolo? Something
sensible. Or the accordion, like Papa did.

47
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:03,956
Same reason you drive a checker and
not a Roman chariot. It's progress.

48
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,190
My son's head is into the future.
And Papa could never play the accordion.

49
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:17,067
- Do you think you're talented?
- You swine! You coward! You cad!

50
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,766
You dare judge me in my misfortitude?

51
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:23,744
You dare to ask me the question
who is the father of my child?

52
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:28,579
- You! You! I point to you, Nigel!
- Next, please.

53
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:34,291
The next group of musicians can
go to the fifth floor now, please.

54
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,370
- Name?
- Excuse me, miss.

55
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,341
You don't need his name. He's not here
for the audition. He's my partner.

56
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,638
- What school's he from?
- He ain't into school.

57
00:06:55,814 --> 00:07:00,911
He's just helping me out with my dancing.
But it's me who's auditioning.

58
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:05,079
Mulholland, Shirley. I'm all fixed up.
I filled in all your papers and all.

59
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:07,486
He doesn't go upstairs
without filling in his name.

60
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:12,823
Leroy's his name, but I'm auditioning.
Shirley Mulholland. That's two L's.

61
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:17,593
- And don't ask him to do no writing.
- Doesn't he talk, even?

62
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:20,464
He ain't into conversation
until you get to know him.

63
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:25,066
- Leroy what?
- Johnson. Leroy Johnson. Can we go up now?

64
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,408
He's not going up
until he checks his knife.

65
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,811
We ain't staying long enough for no trouble.
He's just helping a friend.

66
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:35,383
He's not helping out anyone
unless he checks his knife.

67
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:39,182
This is the High School for Performing Arts.
We don't cut each other up here.

68
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,021
- You want it?
- I want it.

69
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,793
- You sure you want it?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

70
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,124
- Promise you won't steal it, now?
- I promise.

71
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:54,003
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Name?

72
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:57,641
Don't worry, baby. I got lots of knives.

73
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,570
- What are you going to do for us?
- I was gonna sing.

74
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:05,146
- You don't have to sing, honey.
- We know our rights.

75
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:09,514
- You can't refuse her an audition.
- She's not supposed to sing her audition.

76
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:14,750
Please, excuse me, if you don't mind.
See, honey, you don't have to sing for us...

77
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:18,692
...because this is the drama department.
- When she sings, it is drama.

78
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,591
- What's your name, honey?
- Finsecker.

79
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:25,433
Doris Finsecker.

80
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,469
- Hi.
- How do you do?

81
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:36,739
- What's your name?
- Ralph Garci.

82
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:41,279
- Who was your teacher?
- Well, my father taught me.

83
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:46,219
He's doing some work for the government.
I'm actually not supposed to talk about it...

84
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:52,693
...but my father played some of the
most beautiful symphonies...

85
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:55,560
...in the whole world once.
- What did he play?

86
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,736
Trombones.

87
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,103
And French horns.

88
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,697
English horns.

89
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,870
- Saxophones.
- Anything else?

90
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,411
Yeah.

91
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:16,877
- Bongos, maracas, that sort of stuff.
- What did he teach you?

92
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,528
Try the dance department.

93
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:32,429
Yeah, tell him.

94
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:35,535
We can't afford a professional
children's school.

95
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:39,539
Okay, sing and then act.

96
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:45,343
I'm a little nervous.

97
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:50,316
Don't be shy, Sheila. Come over here.
What are you going to do?

98
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,580
- I'm doing The Towering Inferno.
- What?

99
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:58,021
- You know, the movie?
- Oh.

100
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:01,625
All right, I'm playing O.J. Simpson.
I'm in this building.

101
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,428
There's fire all around, right?
So I go to the elevator.

102
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:09,629
Think of it as a concentration exercise.
Just sing to Michael...

103
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,301
...and don't worry about anybody else.
- I don't think I can do that. I can't just stare.

104
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:17,139
He won't mind.

105
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:24,850
- Waiting for the elevator.
- Press the button, Doris.

106
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,122
Her brother Harvey.

107
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,685
Doesn't come, so now I'm getting mad.

108
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,554
Finally it comes, so I get in.
Okay, and there's people all around.

109
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:43,256
And they're looking right at me.

110
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:33,774
Yeah, my father taught me. I'm not
supposed to talk about him right now.

111
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,749
He's doing a little bit of work
for the government, but...

112
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,152
My father is very, very famous.
He danced with the Rockettes.

113
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,751
Sure. Would you begin, please?

114
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:48,264
- I'll be doing "Swanee River" for you.
- Okay.

115
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,992
And...

116
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:56,105
Hon? "Swanee River," please.
Hit it.

117
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:04,110
Doris, what would you do
if you don't make it?

118
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:05,773
We'll make it.

119
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:08,510
Next, please.

120
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,954
But I that am not shaped
for sportive tricks...

121
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:15,023
...nor made to court
an amorous looking glass...

122
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:18,389
...I that am... Cheated of...
Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,075
Why don't you try
the drama department.

124
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:42,548
If again "it was not well cut,"
he'd answer, I spake not true:

125
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:45,085
This is called the Reply Churlish.

126
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,414
Nobody talks about it,
but there's a quota system.

127
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:53,495
Your chances are better if you're black,
Puerto Rican or everything, like me.

128
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:57,964
- I am Puerto Rican.
- Not on your paper you ain't, Ralph Garci.

129
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:01,901
- Your daddy doing government work.
- That's the truth.

130
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:06,370
And he left you his tap shoes, right?
Does he work for Pepsi-Cola too?

131
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,168
Be careful.

132
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:11,073
- To the left. Left.
- Come the other way.

133
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:12,908
All right.

134
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,711
Easy, now. Straight back, Bruno?

135
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:20,546
- Where do you want this at?
- Far corner.

136
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,891
How do you do?

137
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:26,925
Okay. Fine.

138
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:31,363
Great. Look, I'll do that. You just go
and get the rest of the stuff, okay?

139
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:33,594
Oh, Martelli. Bruno Martelli.

140
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:37,304
Would you like to set up
your equipment, Mr. Martelli?

141
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,204
Who taught you?

142
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:50,115
Who taught me? My father, he taught me.
He's in Spain. He makes Italian Westerns.

143
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,620
- Why do you want to go to school here?
- Because Freddie went here.

144
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:58,851
- Freddie?
- Freddie Prinze. He's great. He's the best.

145
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,760
- So you want to be an actor, huh?
- Yeah, sure, I want to be an actor.

146
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:05,458
Judy, Judy, Judy.
Top of the world, Ma.

147
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:10,335
We don't want you to perform. We want
to see who you are. You understand?

148
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,905
- Right.
- Use your own experience.

149
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:16,246
Be simple, be honest,
but most of all, be yourself.

150
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,782
- Be honest. Be simple. Be yourself?
- Be yourself.

151
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:26,655
I'm God, see?
And God is Puerto Rican, you got that? Now.

152
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:31,421
God works in a casa de steam, you know.
It's a steam bath, right?

153
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:37,727
And he's talking to this angel. This angel is
a computer. Right? An electronic computer.

154
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:42,736
I'm God, see? That's why I'm standing
on this chair, you got that? Good.

155
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,674
Does he wanna be a musician
or an airline pilot?

156
00:15:56,787 --> 00:16:00,723
Mr. Martelli. We are ready when you are.
Would you care to begin?

157
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:03,518
Oh, okay. Sure.

158
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:29,541
Mr. Martelli.

159
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,990
Mr. Martelli.

160
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:39,221
Mr. Martelli!

161
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,927
Thank you. One instrument
at a time will be quite sufficient.

162
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:47,933
I could do it in 4/4
if you prefer a disco beat.

163
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,356
She's a disaster.

164
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:28,300
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

165
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:31,339
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...

166
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:36,377
...and then I'll no longer be a Capu...
Capu... Capu-something.

167
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:40,778
- Capulet.
- Capu... Like Cappelletti, the football player?

168
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,112
- Something like that.
- That's what I mean.

169
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:50,585
- Where's his application?
- He doesn't have one.

170
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,955
Well, get him one.

171
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:14,083
- What do you call that?
- Wicked.

172
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:28,196
Thou art thyself.

173
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,596
Thou art not a Montagoo...
Montagazz... Who knows?

174
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:37,502
Okay. This is the last day of auditions.
We've seen a lot of students. We're punchy.

175
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:43,202
We're gonna take a break. Go next door
to Mrs. Shime. Have her audition you.

176
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,508
- Right next door.
- I tell her that you sent me?

177
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,583
- Yeah.
- All right.

178
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,184
By the way...

179
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:54,517
...you were reading the girl's part.
- Shit.

180
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:59,618
- You're not into high school, remember?
- I'm into dancing.

181
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:05,132
You're into ass, you mean.
You don't have to go to high school for that.

182
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:10,296
- I was doing you a favor, remember?
- Some fat fucking favor.

183
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:17,140
Green. Take your things to the third floor.
Give your forms to the senior on the door.

184
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,144
Okay, you go downstairs,
change in the girls' room and wait for him.

185
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,618
I'm through?
I don't have to dance anymore?

186
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:28,814
Where you going, Leroy?
He's in and I'm out, right?

187
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:35,055
Well, fuck you, Leroy! This was my audition,
remember? You're not into high school.

188
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:40,795
We were rehearsing to get me into this
school, not you, you fucker! It's not fair!

189
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:44,735
I didn't want to come here anyway.
This school sucks.

190
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,171
You've done me a favor, shithead.

191
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:51,609
You saved me four fucking years
from this ass-licking school!

192
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:55,148
You looking at one happy lady!

193
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:00,185
Who wants to go to a fucking school
to learn to dance, anyway?

194
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,653
Yeah, hello?

195
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:09,322
No, it isn't. This is Naomi Finsecker
speaking. Her mother. Who is this?

196
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:23,535
Replacement?
What do you mean, replacement?

197
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:30,280
So is she in or is she out?

198
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:36,621
I got in! I got in!
I got into Performing Arts!

199
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:44,060
Doris, we're in!

200
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:36,944
Get her out of there!

201
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:44,123
- Hey, later on.
- All right. All right!

202
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,590
See y'all later.

203
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,559
- Hello.
- Hey, mama, get in the car!

204
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:57,997
Come on, baby, come on.
Don't go to school.

205
00:22:58,173 --> 00:23:01,631
- Martelli, Bruno.
- Bruno. Come on.

206
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,573
Garcia, Raul.

207
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:08,110
- Garcia, Raul?
- It's Ralph.

208
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:12,651
- It says Raul.
- I don't relate to that.

209
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:16,824
- Garcia, Ralph.
- It's Garci.

210
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:21,052
Ralph Garci. I think they
spelled it wrong on the application.

211
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:23,789
- Garci, Ralph.
- Here.

212
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:28,834
- MacNeil, Montgomery.
- Here.

213
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:32,498
- Monroe, Lisa.
- Yes?

214
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,134
Johnson, Leroy.

215
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:38,743
Johnson, Leroy?

216
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:45,952
In future, Mr. Johnson, I'd like you to
leave your ghetto blaster at home, please.

217
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:49,983
I'd have left it home
if it wasn't so goddamn boring in here.

218
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:56,597
This is a classroom, Mr. Johnson. You're
going to be here for the next four years...

219
00:23:56,765 --> 00:24:00,223
...with your eyes open,
homework done, pencils sharpened...

220
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:06,203
...and all food, cigarettes and radios
outside. Do you understand me?

221
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,977
- Why are you here, Mr. Johnson?
- Because I's young and single...

222
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:15,275
...and I loves to mingle.
- Speak English.

223
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,944
- I speak like I likes.
- This is my homeroom. You'll speak as I like.

224
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:24,649
I teach English. Now, if that's
a foreign language, you're gonna learn it.

225
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:31,994
This is no Mickey Mouse school. You won't
get off easy because you're talented.

226
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,330
- I don't care how well you dance...
- Bitch run her fucking mouth.

227
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:40,668
...or how many colored tutus you have.
If you don't give academic subjects...

228
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:44,710
...equal time, you're out.
- Bullshit.

229
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:48,405
You have to arrive earlier
to get dressed and warmed up.

230
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,848
You have to take outside classes
in your major field...

231
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,889
...and study ballet, modern, folk,
jazz, tap and historical dance here...

232
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:59,856
...as well as dance history,
supported adagio...

233
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:05,394
...variation class, makeup, hairstyling
and even acting for dancers.

234
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,970
50,000 people call themselves actors,
and maybe 500 are making a living at it.

235
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:15,303
Most of those do commercials to
pay the rent. The rest wait tables...

236
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:19,879
...clean other people's apartments,
living on welfare and hope.

237
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:22,414
Don't think talent's enough
to get you through.

238
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:27,112
You gotta have a strong technique,
a good agent, and most of all, a thick skin.

239
00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:31,554
Now you're part of an underprivileged
minority, and you're going to suffer.

240
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,128
Pulled tendons, shin splints,
swollen toes, smelly tights...

241
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:39,733
Cattle calls, the humiliation,
the rejection...

242
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:45,305
Melodic dictation theory, keyboard harmony,
elementary piano, piano literature...

243
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:51,469
...music history, orchestration, conducting,
dance band, symphonic band, ensembles...

244
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:55,275
- When do we have lunch?
- Lunch is at 11:30. One half-hour...

245
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:58,646
...and then you'll have everything else.
- What's everything else?

246
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,122
Biology, chemistry, algebra, English,
French, physics, history, et cetera.

247
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:07,722
Dance is not a way
of getting through school.

248
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:12,230
It's a way of life, plus school.
The school part is easier.

249
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:16,836
So you better like yourself a lot.
Because that's all you got to work with.

250
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:21,032
Use yourself.
Your voice, your experiences.

251
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:26,146
You wanna accumulate some experiences?
I got plenty of experiences to spare.

252
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:31,445
You know what?
I live with two chicks.

253
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:34,622
Dance is the hardest
department in the school.

254
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:37,416
Acting is the hardest
profession in the world.

255
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:43,257
Music is the hardest profession of them all.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Tossoff?

256
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:44,489
Indeed.

257
00:27:40,455 --> 00:27:42,082
Okay.

258
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:47,551
No fighting. Stay in line, please.

259
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:50,289
Who's next?

260
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,472
Excuse me.

261
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:08,176
- I'll be doing my scene Thursday...
- I'll be right back.

262
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:16,047
Get out of my seat!

263
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:18,463
- Hi.
- Hi. That's too wild for me.

264
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:22,364
- I'm in your acting class.
- I know.

265
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:24,696
Montgomery MacNeil.

266
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:28,432
- Doris Finsecker.
- Hi. Wanna sit down?

267
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:33,238
All right. Is your mother really
Marsha MacNeil, the actress?

268
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:35,608
- That's right.
- She does wonderful work.

269
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:38,645
- Have you seen her?
- But I've heard.

270
00:32:40,987 --> 00:32:44,821
- I didn't know she lived in New York.
- She doesn't. Officially, she does...

271
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:49,451
...but she's been on the road forever.
She gets paid to stay in hotels...

272
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:53,690
...but she stays with friends. Sends her
per diems home to me and Dr. Golden.

273
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:57,664
- Is that your stepfather?
- My analyst.

274
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,269
What's wrong with you?

275
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:05,041
It's pretty technical, really.
I have problems.

276
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:12,216
- What kind of problems?
- With women.

277
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:23,023
Fine. Swaying with a nice humming
sound, please. And:

278
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:26,625
Let the arms go.

279
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:34,904
Good, good, good.
And chew.

280
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:38,710
Faster.

281
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:41,337
Speed.

282
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:44,176
Tongues out.
Down.

283
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:45,942
Side. Side.

284
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:49,087
And round, round.
Come on.

285
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:01,761
More energy!

286
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:07,472
Do it together, please.
Keep moving.

287
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:11,877
Much better.
Much, much better now.

288
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:20,245
Reach for the jete!

289
00:34:21,054 --> 00:34:23,716
And:

290
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:27,053
Impulse to impulse.

291
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:04,996
Relax.

292
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:07,665
Relax.

293
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:11,729
Sense the floor against your bodies.

294
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:15,770
Feel it against
the backs of your legs.

295
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:17,936
Your arms.

296
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:20,474
Your shoulders.

297
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:23,610
Let your senses remember...

298
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:27,412
...this feeling of heaviness.

299
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:31,548
Relax and breathe.

300
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:36,351
Relax and breathe.

301
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:43,635
All right, let's go. Thank you.
Don't be late. Come on. Don't be late.

302
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:09,261
- Should you be on this floor?
- I have a note.

303
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:12,557
- Miss Berg wants a tambourine.
- Fine.

304
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:20,133
Excuse me? Excuse me?
You speak English?

305
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:22,467
- Bruno Martelli?
- He's across the hall.

306
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,234
Thanks.

307
00:36:29,082 --> 00:36:31,676
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:36,684
- What kind of music notes are those?
- Laser beams.

309
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:40,792
- It's a requiem for Buck Rogers.
- Great.

310
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:45,430
- You ever thought of doing some real music?
- This is my music.

311
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:48,590
- I mean a band.
- I don't like bands. They crowd me.

312
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:53,205
- I prefer my basement, no people.
- There's money though, like in summer trade.

313
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:56,399
- Lf we get together in time.
- I'm really not interested.

314
00:36:56,576 --> 00:37:00,410
There's tea dances and parties,
weddings and bar mitzvahs.

315
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,539
Those things are steady. People always
get married and grow up.

316
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:07,811
- I don't need the hassle.
- I'll take care of everything...

317
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,114
...just like a regular business manager.

318
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,727
I'll look after the bookings, travel,
costume designs, for 10% off the top.

319
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:17,055
Then a straight split
of the performing cut.

320
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,360
- What costume designs?
- Nothing fancy, just sequins and stuff.

321
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:24,970
See-through for me, maybe low-cut.
We gotta give them visuals.

322
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:30,508
The sound might be wicked, but when
you get right down to it, tits book bands.

323
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:34,579
- I think I'll stay in my basement.
- Bruno, this is our chance.

324
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:40,310
- Don't you want success?
- Sure. I just don't think our tits are up to it.

325
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:47,587
Why?

326
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:51,291
Oh, why?

327
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:57,167
God will punish you, Yuri.

328
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:01,871
What crime is this unborn
child guilty of...

329
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:05,067
...that it should not drink of
the milk of paradise?

330
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:09,112
You warned me, Elena.
Not one ruble have I lost, not one.

331
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:18,018
- Can we try this again? It sounds phony.
- I don't wanna try this again.

332
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:22,252
- There's nothing wrong with you.
- Yeah, I know. That's what's wrong with me.

333
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:28,230
Everybody else here is colorful or eccentric
or charismatic, and I'm perfectly ordinary.

334
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:34,169
My nose is ordinary. My body's ordinary.
And my voice, it's...

335
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:37,471
- I don't know why I'm here.
- You wanna be an actress.

336
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:42,104
Yeah, but actors and actresses
are colorful, flamboyant beings.

337
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:45,680
I'm about as flamboyant as a bagel.

338
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:47,480
Hi.

339
00:38:47,654 --> 00:38:49,713
- Hi.
- Hi.

340
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:53,586
- Some people like bagels.
- Some people don't.

341
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,991
- Some people are too old for you.
- He smiles at me.

342
00:38:57,163 --> 00:39:00,257
- He smiles at everyone.
- Yeah, but he winks too.

343
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:03,732
- I think it's a nervous habit.
- He talks to me, often.

344
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:06,870
- Really? What's he say?
- Hi.

345
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:10,370
That's serious. Have you set the date?

346
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:15,671
I'm sorry.

347
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:19,049
- I'm sorry.
- I feel stupid.

348
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:20,310
So get into it.

349
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,818
Study it. Try to remember it
so you can...

350
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:23,978
Hey, M and M.

351
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,988
Seen your shrink lately?

352
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:28,955
- Yesterday.
- You got a special delivery?

353
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,159
How you doing? How are you?

354
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:35,262
Oh, good. That's very good.
You're a good man.

355
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:38,798
They're not for me.
They're for a friend of mine.

356
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:42,063
Who's the lucky fella, huh?

357
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:46,076
Looks like somebody finally
corked up old Finsecker.

358
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:49,142
It can't be Gloria over here.
He's not into chicks.

359
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:54,485
Shut my mouth.

360
00:39:56,155 --> 00:39:57,144
Bye.

361
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:01,015
I hate Ralph Garci, I really do.

362
00:40:01,461 --> 00:40:04,157
I must remember this feeling
and use it in my acting.

363
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,662
I'm scared.

364
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:13,465
I'm scared I won't be able to live up
to their expectations of me.

365
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,275
Flashing images of passion...

366
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:25,677
- and hurl you to the ground
and make mad, passionate love.

367
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:28,643
- I forgot it!
- For two weeks?

368
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:31,847
- I told you, I done it and I forgot it.
- My hearing's fine.

369
00:40:32,024 --> 00:40:36,256
It's your homework that's missing.
And these pages are unintelligible.

370
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:40,259
It's a secret language.
It ain't meant for whiteys.

371
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:42,765
- This isn't a joke.
- I got lots of jokes.

372
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:45,627
- This is garbage!
- My pen broke.

373
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,864
- It's in pencil.
- That broke too.

374
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,771
You can't learn to read,
you can't learn to dance.

375
00:40:52,011 --> 00:40:54,343
You're flunking out.

376
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:55,640
I can read.

377
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:58,784
Terrific! Go ahead, surprise us.
Give him your book.

378
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:01,317
Pay attention. Mr. Johnson is gonna read.

379
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,688
- I said I can read!
- Then read.

380
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:07,382
- No.
- Read!

381
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:09,024
- No!
- Read!

382
00:41:09,195 --> 00:41:10,594
No, you fucking bitch!

383
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:15,359
What the fuck you want me to do,
asking me to read all the fucking time?

384
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:18,026
I hate your guts. You read,
you fucking bitch!

385
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:28,366
It's not natural.

386
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,702
Get off my case, huh, Papa?

387
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:35,770
When I was your age, Bruno,
I had a lot of girlfriends.

388
00:42:35,948 --> 00:42:38,974
- I had a different girlfriend every day.
- I got music.

389
00:42:39,952 --> 00:42:41,943
Same to you, pal! Go ahead.

390
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:46,615
Go ahead! Oh, sure, you got music, okay.
But for what? For yourself.

391
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:47,781
For your headset.

392
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,621
I mean, do I hear it anymore?
Does your mama hear it?

393
00:42:51,797 --> 00:42:53,128
Do your friends hear it?

394
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:55,559
Bruno, do you have friends? Huh?

395
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:59,671
- I don't have time. I told you.
- You told me. You told me.

396
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,808
It's not natural. When I was your age,
I'm telling you...

397
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:05,967
You're not my age. Nobody's my age.
I'm ahead of my time.

398
00:43:06,145 --> 00:43:08,238
Maybe I don't think
people will like my stuff.

399
00:43:08,414 --> 00:43:13,078
How do you know what people will like?
How do they know if they don't hear it?

400
00:43:13,252 --> 00:43:16,983
Bruno, how do they recognize your talent
and give you scholarships...

401
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:19,522
...and record contracts, son,
and awards?

402
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:23,420
Maybe I die undiscovered,
and my ghost gets the Grammy.

403
00:43:23,596 --> 00:43:28,158
Maybe! Look, did I build you a studio
in the basement for a ghost?

404
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:31,997
Did I spent $ 7000 on equipment
for a ghost?

405
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:37,334
Does your mama cook and clean and wear
old clothes for a ghost? A ghost, Bruno?

406
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,946
Elton John's mom has got six mink coats.

407
00:44:53,085 --> 00:44:59,081
"Wel... Wel... Welcome to...

408
00:44:59,258 --> 00:45:03,092
...the wo... Won...

409
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:07,596
Wonderful...

410
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:12,101
...world of...

411
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:18,039
...Ma... Maytag...

412
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,442
...wash... Wash... Washing...

413
00:45:22,615 --> 00:45:25,709
...mach... Ma...

414
00:45:25,885 --> 00:45:28,115
Machines."

415
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:08,857
Talk about Shorofsky.

416
00:46:09,028 --> 00:46:14,898
Mr. Shorofsky does not understand any
music written past Mozart when he was 2.

417
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,194
They're all the same.
What do you expect?

418
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:22,833
Graduating from P.A. Is no
Academy Award. You know what I mean.

419
00:46:23,008 --> 00:46:27,502
It is better than real school. It's free,
and you don't get raped in the hallways.

420
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,342
But it's still small change.

421
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:33,849
I'm just killing time here,
waiting for my opportunity.

422
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:36,783
It might be a movie
or a Broadway musical.

423
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:39,618
But it's coming. I keep my eyes open.

424
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:42,955
I read Back Stage, Show Business
and Variety.

425
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:45,359
You see, I do the whole thing.

426
00:46:45,531 --> 00:46:48,864
Dancing's just the tip
of this iceberg.

427
00:46:49,034 --> 00:46:52,470
A friend of my sister,
she tells fortunes and stuff.

428
00:46:52,638 --> 00:46:56,130
She says I'm doing my last dance
on this dark little planet.

429
00:46:56,308 --> 00:46:58,606
So it's gotta be spectacular, you know?

430
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:01,473
How bright our spirits
go shooting out into space...

431
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:05,947
...depends on how much we contributed
to the earthly brilliance of this world.

432
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:09,986
And I mean to be a major contributor.

433
00:47:11,157 --> 00:47:13,421
A sure-as-shit major contributor.

434
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:23,163
- Can someone just...?
- She's cleaning her cleavage.

435
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:27,829
She's taking out the lint.
Oh, that's beautiful. I wish I had a camera.

436
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:31,306
There she is. Get out of the way.
She's gorgeous.

437
00:47:31,477 --> 00:47:33,775
Oh, now turn around, please.

438
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,671
Oh, please.

439
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:37,440
Oh, look at those tits.

440
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,342
Oh, you could drown in those.

441
00:47:39,518 --> 00:47:44,922
I want you to observe yourself
doing ordinary, everyday things.

442
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:48,086
You'll be asked to duplicate
those here in class.

443
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,660
An actor must develop
an acute sense memory...

444
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:55,266
...so concentrate on how you deal
with things in your world...

445
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:59,700
...how you wash your face
or hold your fork or lift your cup...

446
00:47:59,872 --> 00:48:05,367
...comb your hair. Observe and study
your own mechanicalness.

447
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:10,379
See if you can catch yourself in
the very act of doing or saying something.

448
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:16,453
See if your actions and reactions fall
into patterns and what those patterns are.

449
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:20,388
And in particular, pay close attention
to the physical world.

450
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,723
Isolate and concentrate on the details.

451
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:39,135
Oh, mamacita!

452
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:45,241
Ay, caramba!

453
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:56,252
No! No! No! Give me that!

454
00:48:56,427 --> 00:48:59,055
You must hold your bow like this,
not like that.

455
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,704
Like your dick?

456
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:10,102
Shut up. Again.

457
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:44,299
Watch your plie, Coco.

458
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:49,139
Turn out the arch, Leroy.

459
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,137
Nice, Neisha.

460
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,845
I want to see the leg, Patrick.

461
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:58,318
And stretch.

462
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:01,919
Good.

463
00:50:03,327 --> 00:50:05,056
Keep it together now.

464
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:14,060
Where's the sweat, Lisa?
You're not even trying.

465
00:50:29,253 --> 00:50:32,188
- Michael, congratulations. I heard.
- Oh, thank you.

466
00:50:32,356 --> 00:50:35,519
Don't thank me. You deserved
the award and the scholarship.

467
00:50:35,693 --> 00:50:38,093
You are the best actor in the school.

468
00:50:38,262 --> 00:50:41,197
Well, you were the best actor
in the school.

469
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:43,595
I mean, we'll miss you.

470
00:50:43,768 --> 00:50:45,133
Well, I'll miss you too.

471
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:46,700
- You will?
- Yeah, sure.

472
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:49,203
- We'll keep in touch, I guess, huh?
- Yeah.

473
00:50:49,607 --> 00:50:51,040
Would you sign my yearbook?

474
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:54,770
Yeah, all right. Do you
want me to sign my picture?

475
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:57,574
- That'd be great.
- Oh, okay.

476
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:00,276
- I forgot. What's your name?
- Doris Finsecker.

477
00:51:00,451 --> 00:51:02,612
- Oh, right. Doris.
- But Doris is enough.

478
00:51:02,787 --> 00:51:03,776
Oh, okay.

479
00:51:03,955 --> 00:51:06,549
- Have you decided where you're going?
- California.

480
00:51:06,724 --> 00:51:09,784
- I mean to college, the scholarship.
- I can't use it.

481
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:12,725
- How come?
- William Morris has got big plans for me.

482
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:15,661
- They saw me in that Senior Day show.
- You're kidding?

483
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:18,893
- They wanna represent me.
- They're the biggest agents.

484
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,163
- Yeah.
- Well, that's great!

485
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,965
There's a couple of series
they think I'm right for.

486
00:51:25,142 --> 00:51:28,908
I've had a lot of really good meetings.
Everyone's very excited.

487
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,742
That is so great!
I mean, Hollywood, that's like...

488
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:37,479
Yeah. Well, here I go, off into the sunset.

489
00:51:37,655 --> 00:51:39,919
Hey, good luck. Oh, sorry.

490
00:51:40,091 --> 00:51:43,822
I mean, break a leg,
or whatever they say.

491
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,922
See you.

492
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,831
Hey!

493
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:52,825
We'll see you at Schwab's.

494
00:51:57,008 --> 00:51:58,600
Oh, God, Doris!

495
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:14,617
She's new. I saw her arrive in a limousine.

496
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:17,124
A limousine? No kidding?

497
00:52:18,462 --> 00:52:21,795
- Man, I hope to fuck she's in drama.
- No way. Dance department.

498
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:24,457
She's too beautiful. Look at that ass.

499
00:52:24,635 --> 00:52:28,799
- I don't know about her tits.
- What do you mean? What kind of tits?

500
00:52:31,475 --> 00:52:33,909
- Tits... Pointy ones?
- She looks kind of flat.

501
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:35,306
She's fucking gorgeous!

502
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:37,709
Little-bitty ones
with nips like raisins?

503
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:40,316
She's turning around. Look at that ass.

504
00:52:40,484 --> 00:52:43,476
- Oh, she is a dancer.
- Let me up. Let me up!

505
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,550
Let me see, you fuckers.

506
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:02,839
Last year, we worked
on simple observations.

507
00:53:03,074 --> 00:53:07,670
This year, we're going to turn
that observation inward...

508
00:53:07,845 --> 00:53:10,678
...and work on re-creating
emotional states:

509
00:53:10,848 --> 00:53:14,750
Fear, joy, sorrow, anger.

510
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:20,152
And it'll be more difficult because you'll
have to expose more of you...

511
00:53:20,324 --> 00:53:23,088
...what's on the inside of you.

512
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,195
For your first acting exercise
this year, I want you...

513
00:53:26,364 --> 00:53:29,697
...to re-create a difficult memory...

514
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:34,531
...a painful moment when you first learned
something about yourself that hurt.

515
00:53:34,705 --> 00:53:38,106
And I mean really hurt.

516
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:40,368
And reach.

517
00:53:41,212 --> 00:53:44,272
And through. And drop.

518
00:53:44,448 --> 00:53:46,882
And back.

519
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,085
Hi, I'm Lisa Monroe.

520
00:53:56,293 --> 00:53:57,658
Hilary van Doren.

521
00:53:57,962 --> 00:53:59,293
I love your coat.

522
00:53:59,463 --> 00:54:01,090
I saw that in Bendel's window.

523
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:05,964
- My stepmother bought it for me.
- Really?

524
00:54:06,137 --> 00:54:09,129
I wouldn't mind that kind of stepmother.

525
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:13,641
She didn't do it for me.
She wants my father to think she cares.

526
00:54:13,811 --> 00:54:16,575
Besides, she loves shopping.

527
00:54:16,747 --> 00:54:20,012
She gets multiple orgasm
every time she buys something.

528
00:54:20,484 --> 00:54:22,645
Sounds great. I think I like her.

529
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,151
You can have her.

530
00:54:24,588 --> 00:54:28,080
- Where's all the sweat, Lisa?
- I'm working on it.

531
00:54:28,592 --> 00:54:30,924
You're not working on it hard enough.

532
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:33,120
Get rid of the gum.

533
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:45,966
Watch me.

534
00:54:48,512 --> 00:54:50,503
Lift the bow off the string, Martelli.

535
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:53,108
Mozart wouldn't do this today.

536
00:54:53,284 --> 00:54:55,445
- Do what?
- This bowing business.

537
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:57,587
He'd plug his keyboard into an amp...

538
00:54:57,755 --> 00:55:00,952
...and he'd have string quartets
coming out of his fingers.

539
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:04,523
And who would play all these
science-fiction symphonies?

540
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:07,359
- He would.
- All by himself?

541
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:11,461
He'd overdub and mix, of course.
He wouldn't make the same old noise.

542
00:55:11,635 --> 00:55:13,569
- Noise?
- He'd sound electric.

543
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:18,003
He'd have spacier strings and horns
and computerized bassoons.

544
00:55:18,476 --> 00:55:21,502
- One man is not an orchestra.
- Who needs orchestras?

545
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,979
You can do it all with a keyboard,
an amp and enough power.

546
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:28,950
You're going to play all by yourself?

547
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,586
You don't need anybody else.

548
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:34,583
That's not music, Martelli.
That's masturbation.

549
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,222
See, I'm not naturally graceful.

550
00:55:39,563 --> 00:55:41,690
Grace doesn't run in our family.

551
00:55:41,866 --> 00:55:45,825
It's our genes. I've had to work
so hard to come this far.

552
00:55:46,003 --> 00:55:48,904
- God, I've been at it since I was 4.
- Me too.

553
00:55:49,073 --> 00:55:51,064
I started out with tap and stuff.

554
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:55,269
Then my mom kept buying me pretty
ballet tutus, and I got hooked on it.

555
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:58,244
Less lip, Monroe! More sweat!

556
00:55:58,849 --> 00:56:01,181
- She's just a bitch.
- She hates me.

557
00:56:01,352 --> 00:56:05,049
This is a dance class, Lisa,
not the Charles Atlas plan.

558
00:56:05,356 --> 00:56:08,689
- Shut your mouth.
- Where are your tights?

559
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:11,019
I told you I got them.
I just forgot them.

560
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:12,856
What's he talking about?

561
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,191
Tights. He won't wear them.

562
00:56:16,534 --> 00:56:21,267
Look, Leroy, I told you, if you don't have
tights, you don't dance. Now go!

563
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:27,237
Oh, I love your accent. What did you say?

564
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:29,038
I dig his black ass.

565
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:33,707
- It's taken, Goldilocks.
- Don't count on it.

566
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:45,559
A painful memory.

567
00:56:45,729 --> 00:56:48,459
What does he mean by a painful memory?

568
00:56:48,632 --> 00:56:51,066
I don't know. I can't find
a painful memory.

569
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:52,634
I know I have them.

570
00:56:52,803 --> 00:56:55,738
I mean, my pain's as good
as anybody else's.

571
00:56:55,906 --> 00:56:59,137
I have lots of them. You can borrow
one of mine if you want.

572
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:03,974
Like, I used to wet my bed. There, that
was painful. You can have that memory.

573
00:57:04,148 --> 00:57:05,479
No, thank you.

574
00:57:05,649 --> 00:57:09,642
Then there was the last time my father
packed his bags and left us.

575
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,754
That really was painful.

576
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:17,656
Or the first time my mother flew to L.A.
And didn't come back for six weeks.

577
00:57:17,928 --> 00:57:20,761
Or the first time I fell in love.

578
00:57:20,931 --> 00:57:23,331
Where'd that come from?

579
00:57:23,934 --> 00:57:26,027
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

580
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:04,427
You're gonna tell everybody that?

581
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:07,593
It's the most painful memory
I can think of.

582
00:59:07,771 --> 00:59:10,535
He didn't say the most painful.
He just said painful.

583
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:14,701
- We're supposed to expose ourselves.
- Imagine what Ralph Garci will say.

584
00:59:15,045 --> 00:59:19,539
A pie in the face comes with the job.
That's what my mom says, and she knows.

585
00:59:19,717 --> 00:59:20,945
I don't get it.

586
00:59:21,118 --> 00:59:25,179
A real artist must never be afraid of
what other people will say about him.

587
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:28,119
It was a time when I realized
something about myself.

588
00:59:28,392 --> 00:59:31,225
- Maybe you didn't realize it right.
- What do you mean?

589
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:35,262
Well, I mean, everybody falls in love
with their analyst.

590
00:59:35,566 --> 00:59:38,228
There's a word for that, isn't there?

591
00:59:38,402 --> 00:59:40,893
Homosexual.

592
01:00:36,794 --> 01:00:39,285
That's my music.
That lunatic stole my tape.

593
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:51,772
Wow, that's me.

594
01:00:54,376 --> 01:00:56,310
That's my son's music!
My son Bruno Martelli!

595
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,976
He wrote the music.
Today, 46th Street...

596
01:01:03,151 --> 01:01:06,450
...tomorrow, Madison Square Garden.

597
01:01:11,927 --> 01:01:14,862
- Papa, what are you doing?
- Bruno!

598
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:18,397
You've lost your mind. You're crazy.
Those tapes aren't ready.

599
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:21,900
Look at the people.
They don't know it's not ready.

600
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:26,131
Look at it, they like it!
Bruno, they like it! Bruno!

601
01:01:55,637 --> 01:01:58,572
- Hey, yo!
- Huh?

602
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,642
Move your fucking parade!
What do you think this is, 5th Avenue?

603
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:04,608
Back it up!

604
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:10,912
I'll get your ass, buddy!
Who do you think you are?

605
01:02:17,959 --> 01:02:20,860
You're next, you hear me?

606
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,759
Get away from there.
What are you doing?

607
01:02:23,932 --> 01:02:25,456
How do you like that?

608
01:02:25,634 --> 01:02:27,932
Pick that up, you son of a bitch!

609
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:07,954
I thought I was just
going through a stage.

610
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:11,523
That's what everyone told me.

611
01:03:11,695 --> 01:03:14,721
And it never
worried me when I was 10.

612
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:20,466
Except they told me the same thing
at 12 and 14.

613
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:28,573
So finally, my analyst
leveled with me.

614
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:32,407
He said it was probably a life choice.

615
01:03:38,355 --> 01:03:40,289
It's funny.

616
01:03:42,226 --> 01:03:47,289
"Gay" used to mean
such a happy kind of word once.

617
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:54,402
Not that it bothers me.
I'm pretty well-adjusted, really.

618
01:03:56,373 --> 01:03:58,398
I mean...

619
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:04,179
...never being happy...

620
01:04:04,548 --> 01:04:08,006
...isn't the same as being unhappy.

621
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:10,413
Is it?

622
01:04:12,823 --> 01:04:16,156
Dr. Golden explains it real well.

623
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:19,293
He explains everything well.

624
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:24,991
I've had a lot of help.

625
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:40,509
Hey, Doris, you wanna go to
The Rocky Horror Show tomorrow night?

626
01:04:40,684 --> 01:04:41,946
That sounds great.

627
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:46,351
It starts at midnight, so you better
check it out with your mom.

628
01:04:46,557 --> 01:04:50,391
Calling Montgomery MacNeil.

629
01:04:50,561 --> 01:04:53,621
Oh, Montgomery.

630
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:03,198
I suppose that a fuck
is out of the question?

631
01:05:03,373 --> 01:05:06,342
There he is, Ralph Garci,
right on the button.

632
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,637
- Nice.
- Get off!

633
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:13,875
- I warned you this would happen.
- It's your case, man. I don't give a fuck.

634
01:05:14,051 --> 01:05:17,145
- It's a joke, that's all. It just came out.
- Like me.

635
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:21,655
Yeah. Hey, Doris, listen,
I meant to tell you.

636
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:26,057
There's an open call for a movie
at the Diplomat Hotel.

637
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:29,631
- Oh, yeah?
- They're looking for your type.

638
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,530
- What's my type?
- You know, your type.

639
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:37,072
- Irishy, Jewishy, paranoid.
- What's the name of this movie?

640
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:41,575
- I Was a Teenage Fag Hag.
- You shit!

641
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,138
Stop it!

642
01:05:46,316 --> 01:05:49,149
I never knew it would
be like this, Doris.

643
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:53,346
Oh, come closer, sweetheart.
Oh, my, such embrace.

644
01:05:58,896 --> 01:06:01,956
The Silvermans know
some very important people.

645
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:05,966
They really have connections.
They're mishpoche with Soupy Sales.

646
01:06:06,136 --> 01:06:08,969
Oh, listen.
Your nice white blouse is ironed.

647
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:12,540
Or you could wear your pink dress
with the ribbons.

648
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:15,735
- You look so pretty in that.
- I hate that pink dress.

649
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:18,746
- So don't wear your pink dress.
- I'm not going, Mama!

650
01:06:18,949 --> 01:06:20,917
- Then gargle.
- I'm going out to dinner!

651
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:23,951
- It's a catered affair.
- It's not the food!

652
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:26,553
This is an opportunity to perform.

653
01:06:26,723 --> 01:06:29,715
- Take advantage of it.
- I promised Montgomery!

654
01:06:29,893 --> 01:06:32,885
Well, I promised the Silvermans!

655
01:06:35,899 --> 01:06:39,733
It's a party, Doris.
They need a singer.

656
01:06:39,903 --> 01:06:44,772
And you, you need exposure.
So you're going.

657
01:06:45,275 --> 01:06:47,266
I'm not!

658
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:37,424
Very good, Doris.
What did you realize about yourself?

659
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:43,460
I don't like birthday parties.
Or pink dresses.

660
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:47,767
Or the Silvermans. Or Brooklyn.

661
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,429
Or even being Jewish.

662
01:07:50,707 --> 01:07:52,402
I mean, it's not bad...

663
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,601
...but it's not all I am.

664
01:07:55,779 --> 01:08:00,148
I don't know who I am,
and I never will if I don't assert myself.

665
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:04,811
I'm 16 years old.
I've got to assert myself sometime.

666
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:08,986
Don't I?

667
01:08:09,393 --> 01:08:11,520
Okay, Doris. Ralph?

668
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,397
I was coming home from
school one day.

669
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:17,828
As usual.

670
01:08:18,568 --> 01:08:23,528
I had a couple of pieces of business
to attend to in the neighborhood.

671
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,869
It was January.

672
01:08:27,377 --> 01:08:29,811
It was snowing like crazy.

673
01:08:32,582 --> 01:08:35,745
Santa Claus just ripped
everybody off.

674
01:08:36,253 --> 01:08:39,347
He split for Toy Town or Igloo City...

675
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:42,754
...or the North Pole
or wherever the hell he goes.

676
01:08:45,429 --> 01:08:47,556
So anyway...

677
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,791
I was going home, and...

678
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,063
I found this note.

679
01:08:56,506 --> 01:08:59,066
It said my two chicks were in church.

680
01:08:59,242 --> 01:09:02,643
What the hell are my two chicks
doing in church?

681
01:09:03,947 --> 01:09:06,279
Somebody die or something?

682
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:13,520
That was... That was a joke.
That was supposed to be a joke.

683
01:09:20,297 --> 01:09:23,858
Anyway, I went home.

684
01:09:26,737 --> 01:09:31,936
I dropped a little incense like
I always do, just to unwind a little bit.

685
01:09:34,511 --> 01:09:37,139
And I put on the TV set.

686
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:43,246
And there was
this guy on the TV.

687
01:09:46,456 --> 01:09:49,084
And he was talking
about Freddie.

688
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:56,365
He... He said that...

689
01:09:58,034 --> 01:10:03,802
He said that Freddie Prinze
put a gun to his head...

690
01:10:03,974 --> 01:10:08,104
...and he killed himself.

691
01:10:11,648 --> 01:10:14,981
You know, it was an accident, man.

692
01:10:16,586 --> 01:10:20,352
Shit, I mean, he was fucking...
He was very gifted.

693
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:26,624
You always laughed at him
because he was very fucking talented.

694
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:33,801
And sometimes you didn't even
wanna laugh at him...

695
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,029
...and you laughed at him anyway.

696
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:39,033
But those motherfuckers...

697
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:42,042
...they had to say that
he was depressed...

698
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:45,807
...and he was suicidal,
and that he was fucked up.

699
01:10:45,982 --> 01:10:50,749
They wanted his fucking ass, man.
They wanted to nail his ass.

700
01:10:50,921 --> 01:10:55,017
Because he didn't think living
was such a happy trip, you know?

701
01:10:56,693 --> 01:11:00,220
We can't have happy people
walking on this planet.

702
01:11:00,397 --> 01:11:03,457
Everybody's gotta be
so goddamn serious.

703
01:11:03,633 --> 01:11:06,067
Everyone's gotta stay in business...

704
01:11:06,236 --> 01:11:10,730
...and suffer so the fucking witch doctors
and the deodorant-spray people...

705
01:11:10,907 --> 01:11:14,172
...and plastic surgeons
could stay in business.

706
01:11:14,344 --> 01:11:18,246
And we can all go fucking pray
to the asshole God up there...

707
01:11:18,415 --> 01:11:21,475
...that fucked it up
in the first place!

708
01:11:26,089 --> 01:11:30,116
Does all this make you
realize anything about yourself?

709
01:11:30,393 --> 01:11:33,920
- What?
- How does it affect you?

710
01:11:35,065 --> 01:11:37,397
How does it affect me?

711
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:41,302
I'm here,
and I'm in this fucking school.

712
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:44,497
And I'm fucking everybody back
for Freddie!

713
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:46,505
Take it easy, Ralph.

714
01:11:46,676 --> 01:11:50,009
You want them laughing
with you, not at you.

715
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,440
I don't want them laughing.

716
01:12:04,794 --> 01:12:06,386
Leroy?

717
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:08,121
Ma'am?

718
01:12:08,632 --> 01:12:10,896
What are you wearing, Leroy?

719
01:12:11,334 --> 01:12:14,303
- A hat.
- On your feet, Leroy.

720
01:12:14,471 --> 01:12:18,669
Oh, those. You like them? They get me
to class quicker, get more learning in.

721
01:12:18,842 --> 01:12:21,640
- What about your book report?
- I done it.

722
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:24,974
- You did it.
- 1000 words. I counted them too.

723
01:12:25,148 --> 01:12:28,640
- The Best of Playboy isn't a book report.
- It's reading, ain't it?

724
01:12:28,818 --> 01:12:33,778
So is 1984, Huckleberry Finn,
Great Expectations. You heard of those?

725
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:35,822
I seen a couple of the movies.

726
01:12:35,992 --> 01:12:39,189
If you don't read,
you're missing so much.

727
01:12:39,362 --> 01:12:45,130
- I don't like reading. It's not my style.
- Then try Othello. He's black.

728
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:48,667
- 1000 words in two weeks.
- Or what?

729
01:12:48,872 --> 01:12:52,638
Or you'll skate right out of
this school, Mr. Johnson.

730
01:13:09,275 --> 01:13:11,004
Come in.

731
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:14,207
- You wanted to see me?
- Sit down.

732
01:13:23,489 --> 01:13:26,219
You're not working hard enough, Lisa.

733
01:13:26,726 --> 01:13:29,456
Well, I've been sick.

734
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:32,330
Dancers don't get sick.

735
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:34,795
Well, my doctor told me...

736
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:38,630
...to take it easy
for a week or two until I feel okay.

737
01:13:38,804 --> 01:13:43,104
- So now it's the doctor's fault?
- Don't you believe me?

738
01:13:43,276 --> 01:13:44,766
I believe you, Lisa.

739
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:48,879
But I don't have room
for you in this class anymore.

740
01:13:49,048 --> 01:13:51,448
But I brought a doctor's note.

741
01:13:51,617 --> 01:13:55,519
There are too many other girls
who take dance seriously...

742
01:13:55,688 --> 01:13:58,953
...to waste time and space
on someone who isn't dedicated.

743
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:03,289
- But I am dedicated.
- I'm sorry, Lisa. I don't see it.

744
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:06,860
I got into this school, didn't I?

745
01:14:07,033 --> 01:14:10,662
We made a mistake.
Sometimes it just doesn't work out.

746
01:14:10,836 --> 01:14:14,067
- You'll get over it.
- I'll work harder.

747
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,004
- Maybe.
- I promise I'll be better.

748
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:19,337
Better isn't good enough.

749
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:23,812
I don't think you'll ever
be good enough. You don't have it.

750
01:14:23,983 --> 01:14:29,285
That's a hard thing to hear, and it's not
a pleasant thing to say, but it's the truth.

751
01:14:29,455 --> 01:14:33,323
I'm saving you a lot of time and pain
by saying it now.

752
01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:36,624
I don't wanna be the best.

753
01:14:37,396 --> 01:14:40,559
- Well, you won't be.
- I just wanna dance.

754
01:14:41,867 --> 01:14:47,134
- Well, you'll never be a Mikhail, Lisa.
- I can't fail, Miss Berg.

755
01:14:47,306 --> 01:14:51,538
- I only ever wanted to be a dancer.
- You'll get over it.

756
01:14:51,711 --> 01:14:56,944
- What do I tell my mother?
- Have her call me and I'll explain.

757
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:29,802
Fuck it. If I can't dance,
I'll change to the drama department.

758
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:33,641
I tell you,
you're a fucking good actress.

759
01:16:40,286 --> 01:16:43,687
I heard the bitch came down
on her real hard.

760
01:16:43,856 --> 01:16:47,451
- So? Life comes down hard.
- She just took a real bad dump, kid.

761
01:16:49,528 --> 01:16:53,658
Better she realizes it now
than OD in some motel room at 30.

762
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:56,597
You might show
a little more sympathy, dear.

763
01:16:56,936 --> 01:17:00,064
- I'm not "dear."
- Evidemment.

764
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,571
You're not tres sensitive either.

765
01:17:02,842 --> 01:17:04,104
I'm a professional.

766
01:17:04,276 --> 01:17:07,973
A few unkind words aren't
going to bother me none.

767
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:13,180
- I know it won't all be standing ovations.
- Certainly not for you, my dear.

768
01:17:13,853 --> 01:17:16,378
Look, I'm not "my dear."
You can fuck "my dear."

769
01:17:16,555 --> 01:17:20,787
Well, thank you. That might be fun.

770
01:17:23,662 --> 01:17:27,962
And that might be impossible.
He's not into vanilla.

771
01:17:28,133 --> 01:17:30,158
Might be a nice change
from black cherry.

772
01:17:30,336 --> 01:17:33,703
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, honey.

773
01:17:33,873 --> 01:17:37,502
Yes, but who wants diabetes?

774
01:17:42,014 --> 01:17:45,541
I mean, you don't understand.
Listen to me, man.

775
01:17:45,718 --> 01:17:49,245
Diction. Watch your diction, Ralph.
You're slurring your words.

776
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:54,256
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Marlon Brando slurred his words.

777
01:17:54,426 --> 01:17:57,691
Montgomery Clift and
James Dean slurred their words.

778
01:17:57,863 --> 01:18:01,993
They were the greatest actors in the world
and nobody could understand them.

779
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:05,534
Wait a second. What's so funny?

780
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:20,851
Hey, it's Raul.
Where's my two chicks, huh?

781
01:18:28,427 --> 01:18:32,193
Look at you! You got so big!
Where is Mom? Is she home?

782
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,590
Hey, cupcake. Come here, cupcake.

783
01:19:03,762 --> 01:19:07,596
Faggot.
That's what you are now, man.

784
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,901
What you doing? Whoa! Damn, man.

785
01:19:55,481 --> 01:19:58,814
Martelli! Bruno Martelli!

786
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,349
Shit!

787
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:12,519
In the beginning
she's not in love with him...

788
01:20:12,698 --> 01:20:14,893
- God, you live here, Montgomery?
- Yeah.

789
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:17,501
- This is a great pad.
- You like it?

790
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:21,231
It's great. What happened to all
your furniture? You get ripped off?

791
01:20:21,407 --> 01:20:24,001
- It closed in Cincinnati.
- What's that mean?

792
01:20:24,176 --> 01:20:27,737
My mom kept saying she was gonna
fix it up when she got into a long run.

793
01:20:27,913 --> 01:20:30,575
- She's got a lousy choice in plays.
- It's perfect.

794
01:20:30,749 --> 01:20:35,413
We don't need nothing for rehearsal.
Ready when you are, Mr. Director.

795
01:20:35,587 --> 01:20:40,047
- All right, page one, Act 1.
- All right, page one, Act 1.

796
01:21:14,793 --> 01:21:17,057
Raul?

797
01:21:42,955 --> 01:21:45,116
Raul?

798
01:21:59,471 --> 01:22:04,135
If you're kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

799
01:22:04,309 --> 01:22:08,245
I know how you feel.
But I'm having a real good time now.

800
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:09,971
I'm enjoying myself.

801
01:22:10,182 --> 01:22:13,174
So you see, you're not such
a dog as you think you are.

802
01:22:13,352 --> 01:22:15,479
I'm having a very good time too.

803
01:22:15,654 --> 01:22:19,488
So there you are. I'm not such a dog
as I think I am.

804
01:22:19,658 --> 01:22:21,819
I think you're a very nice guy.

805
01:22:21,994 --> 01:22:25,555
I don't know why
a girl hasn't grabbed you.

806
01:22:25,731 --> 01:22:30,225
Yeah, I don't either. I am a nice guy.

807
01:22:30,469 --> 01:22:33,302
I'm also a real smart guy too.

808
01:22:41,446 --> 01:22:45,849
Wait. There's a whole speech yet.
You're not supposed to kiss yet.

809
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:53,387
Ralph. Doris. Ralph, you have a whole
other speech here you haven't even done.

810
01:22:53,559 --> 01:22:56,323
Ralph, you're not supposed to kiss yet.

811
01:23:03,535 --> 01:23:06,402
My mother was French
and very beautiful.

812
01:23:06,572 --> 01:23:12,238
Straight out of some chateau.
She danced every night for hours.

813
01:23:12,411 --> 01:23:16,370
Daddy was in Washington
or out to dinner with clients...

814
01:23:16,548 --> 01:23:20,040
...while Mom was with Tchaikovsky,
Ravel, Mantovani.

815
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:23,950
You'll meet my stepmother, Claudia.
Trainee witch.

816
01:23:24,122 --> 01:23:27,751
No cracks about being Chinese.
She's had her eyes fixed.

817
01:23:27,926 --> 01:23:31,418
She recuperated in Palm Springs,
where she had her purse stolen.

818
01:23:31,597 --> 01:23:34,327
She lost all her credit cards.

819
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:39,531
Dad doesn't want to report it, though.
The thief is spending less than she did.

820
01:23:47,312 --> 01:23:49,212
Hi, Daddy.

821
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,315
Hi.

822
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:56,115
Oh, this is Leroy. Homework.

823
01:27:14,052 --> 01:27:17,544
That was nice. Really.

824
01:27:17,989 --> 01:27:20,719
Sentimental shit.

825
01:27:21,626 --> 01:27:24,151
That was beautiful!

826
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:28,493
That was beautiful.

827
01:27:28,867 --> 01:27:31,131
It was beautiful.

828
01:27:38,743 --> 01:27:42,338
- Yeah, this is it here.
- You live here?

829
01:27:42,514 --> 01:27:45,347
My sister lives here.
I'm always welcome.

830
01:27:45,517 --> 01:27:47,041
- Very nice place.
- Yeah.

831
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:51,155
They're very fancy, huh?
I'll wait till you get inside.

832
01:27:51,323 --> 01:27:53,553
No. It's okay. Really.

833
01:27:53,725 --> 01:27:56,057
- Okay.
- It's a good neighborhood.

834
01:27:56,228 --> 01:28:00,460
- It's not much, but...
- Please, come on. That's not necessary.

835
01:28:00,632 --> 01:28:02,099
I should pay you.

836
01:28:02,267 --> 01:28:06,601
You know, I play your tapes
for my customers, you know.

837
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:12,300
They love that stuff.
My tips go up 20%, at least.

838
01:28:13,178 --> 01:28:17,046
- And my son is happy.
- He's writing some good shit too.

839
01:28:17,215 --> 01:28:20,878
We're gonna be all over the charts
one of these days.

840
01:28:21,052 --> 01:28:25,648
- You make him happy, you know that?
- We're a hot team, you know.

841
01:28:25,824 --> 01:28:30,523
- You make him hotter. Know what I mean?
- Sure.

842
01:28:30,695 --> 01:28:35,632
I seem to have that effect on people.
What can I do? Thanks again.

843
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,394
- Good night, Bruno.
- Night. Take it easy.

844
01:30:04,389 --> 01:30:05,879
You're crazy.

845
01:30:06,324 --> 01:30:07,484
You call a doctor?

846
01:30:07,826 --> 01:30:08,986
I don't think she's hurt.

847
01:30:09,261 --> 01:30:11,388
Since when are you
in the thinking business?

848
01:30:11,763 --> 01:30:12,923
She's frightened.

849
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:16,462
- She's 5 fucking years old!
- Please keep your voice down.

850
01:30:18,503 --> 01:30:22,030
- You're in a church, my son.
- You're in the Dark Ages!

851
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:24,737
You kiss my ass, Padre.

852
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:30,109
She needs a doctor! A doctor!
Not the goddamn Holy Ghost!

853
01:30:54,906 --> 01:30:56,965
Is she all right?

854
01:31:01,146 --> 01:31:04,047
You're not attacked by a creep
at 5 years old and all right.

855
01:31:04,482 --> 01:31:06,143
I'm sorry.

856
01:31:06,451 --> 01:31:09,181
Doris, I wasn't there!
I wasn't fucking there!

857
01:31:09,654 --> 01:31:10,814
What about your father?

858
01:31:11,356 --> 01:31:13,688
I happen to be between
fathers right now.

859
01:31:13,858 --> 01:31:15,189
What does that mean?

860
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,953
You got to understand something.

861
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:21,499
You got to understand
the Puerto Rican woman.

862
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:25,064
She thinks about
the kids...

863
01:31:25,236 --> 01:31:29,332
...how they gotta have a father.
Love has nothing to do with it.

864
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:32,472
My mom has an extra room.
She rents it out.

865
01:31:32,644 --> 01:31:35,579
Next thing you know,
I've got a new father.

866
01:31:41,419 --> 01:31:44,855
They're all right, mostly.
They may stay a day...

867
01:31:45,323 --> 01:31:48,292
...or a week or a month,
if we're lucky.

868
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,224
Sometimes they even pay the rent.

869
01:31:53,398 --> 01:31:55,229
They keep out all the rats.

870
01:31:56,134 --> 01:31:59,126
Not animal-type rats.
I'm talking about real rats...

871
01:31:59,304 --> 01:32:00,999
...the junkies and the winos...

872
01:32:01,172 --> 01:32:04,699
...and the shitheads
and the people who beat up...

873
01:32:08,546 --> 01:32:11,140
...little 5-year-old kids.

874
01:32:14,853 --> 01:32:16,878
I got three sisters, see?

875
01:32:18,656 --> 01:32:22,717
One of them, Maria, she's
in kind of a special place.

876
01:32:24,028 --> 01:32:28,055
We see her a couple times a year.
She's got a birth defect.

877
01:32:31,202 --> 01:32:34,000
That's a goddamn lie.

878
01:32:35,707 --> 01:32:38,369
That's a goddamn lie!

879
01:32:40,044 --> 01:32:42,808
Want to know about my father?
My first fucking father?

880
01:32:42,981 --> 01:32:45,108
He ain't no special shit.

881
01:32:46,484 --> 01:32:49,942
He's in New York State Penitentiary.
He's doing time.

882
01:32:51,256 --> 01:32:54,316
I remember this one night
he got bothered...

883
01:32:54,492 --> 01:32:57,984
...because I was making her laugh.
I was telling her stories.

884
01:32:58,430 --> 01:33:01,957
It was just kid stuff.
Flying carpets and dragons.

885
01:33:02,133 --> 01:33:05,227
And he got mad because she was laughing!

886
01:33:05,804 --> 01:33:08,398
And he said I was telling her lies.

887
01:33:08,706 --> 01:33:10,264
And this one night...

888
01:33:11,576 --> 01:33:13,271
...he got bothered.

889
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:16,913
He's beating me and coming down on me...

890
01:33:17,081 --> 01:33:18,571
...I said, "I make her laugh."

891
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,913
That's not a lie, that's a gift, goddamn it.

892
01:33:23,154 --> 01:33:25,281
He can't do it.

893
01:33:26,524 --> 01:33:30,790
He said if he can't do it,
he sure as shit's gonna stop it.

894
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,864
And he went for me, and...

895
01:33:35,733 --> 01:33:38,702
...she got in the way
all of a sudden, and...

896
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:42,967
...he put her head inside a fucking wall.

897
01:33:43,842 --> 01:33:47,141
If it was my fucking head,
it would've been all right...

898
01:33:47,312 --> 01:33:49,507
...but it wasn't. It was hers!

899
01:33:49,881 --> 01:33:54,011
If it was my fucking fat head,
it would've been all right.

900
01:33:55,687 --> 01:33:59,054
She's a beautiful kid.
She's 5 fucking years old.

901
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:04,387
She's got a pretty little laugh.
She still laughs, as a matter of fact.

902
01:35:06,224 --> 01:35:08,385
Barbra Streisand didn't
change her name.

903
01:35:08,626 --> 01:35:12,255
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I'll call you Doris, like always.

904
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:13,590
I won't answer.

905
01:35:13,765 --> 01:35:17,599
- It's a perfectly good name.
- For a perfectly good person.

906
01:35:17,769 --> 01:35:21,227
A skinny, boring, nondescript,
perfectly good person.

907
01:35:21,573 --> 01:35:26,977
I have a lot of friends named Doris,
and they are none of those things.

908
01:35:27,211 --> 01:35:29,372
- Yeah, but they're all...
- What?

909
01:35:29,614 --> 01:35:31,775
No, no, no. Say it. Go ahead. Say it!

910
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:36,387
I would like to know what my daughter
thinks is wrong with my friends.

911
01:35:36,554 --> 01:35:40,081
I don't want a middle-aged name.
I can't relate to it.

912
01:35:40,391 --> 01:35:41,881
You can call me Dominique.

913
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,220
Dominique.

914
01:35:43,394 --> 01:35:45,726
- That's ridiculous.
- It's French.

915
01:35:45,897 --> 01:35:50,357
- I know what it is, but it's not you.
- I'll grow into it.

916
01:35:50,635 --> 01:35:54,093
- Dominique Finsecker?
- No. Dominique Dupont.

917
01:35:54,706 --> 01:35:56,833
- Sounds like a hooker.
- Oh, Mama.

918
01:35:57,008 --> 01:36:00,910
I don't know what's happening to you.
Tell me what's happening to you.

919
01:36:01,312 --> 01:36:03,507
Where did my Doris go?

920
01:36:03,815 --> 01:36:07,808
Something wonderful is happening
to me, Mama. I'm growing up.

921
01:36:09,053 --> 01:36:11,248
You're becoming somebody else.

922
01:36:11,556 --> 01:36:15,959
- I'm becoming an actress.
- I want you to be the Doris that I know.

923
01:36:16,127 --> 01:36:19,096
That I love. That helps
me with the groceries.

924
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:22,089
Makes me birthday cards...

925
01:36:22,266 --> 01:36:24,700
...out of Cheerio packets, huh?

926
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:26,770
Not Dominique...

927
01:36:27,105 --> 01:36:29,130
...who stays out all night.

928
01:36:29,307 --> 01:36:30,706
Oh, Mama.

929
01:36:30,908 --> 01:36:32,705
And gets pregnant.

930
01:36:33,211 --> 01:36:35,577
Or has an abortion, God forbid.

931
01:36:37,348 --> 01:36:40,579
Now, Dominique, she'd be smart.

932
01:36:41,486 --> 01:36:43,181
But my Doris...

933
01:36:43,755 --> 01:36:45,780
...she's dumb enough to get knocked up...

934
01:36:46,157 --> 01:36:48,455
Mama, it was just one night!

935
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:51,987
That's all it takes.

936
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:06,808
We'd like to welcome everyone to
The Rocky Horror Picture Show...

937
01:37:06,978 --> 01:37:09,378
...here at the 8th Street Playhouse!

938
01:37:14,552 --> 01:37:17,544
And our regulars would
like to wish a warm welcome...

939
01:37:17,722 --> 01:37:20,247
...to all you virgins!

940
01:37:23,961 --> 01:37:26,691
We have some special occasions tonight.

941
01:37:27,098 --> 01:37:29,658
Tonight is Gail's birthday.

942
01:37:33,905 --> 01:37:37,898
We have a special button
for a special young lady.

943
01:37:38,076 --> 01:37:42,308
Tonight is Christine's 150th time!

944
01:37:53,224 --> 01:37:55,249
Let's hear it for her! Come on!

945
01:38:01,933 --> 01:38:05,027
Now, we have a special warning
from the management.

946
01:38:05,203 --> 01:38:08,229
No lit candles. No throwing
food at the screen. Understand?

947
01:38:08,506 --> 01:38:09,803
Get on with the show!

948
01:38:10,341 --> 01:38:12,935
This is the fucking show!
If you don't like it...

949
01:38:13,111 --> 01:38:15,443
...you can go see the movie
in Staten Island!

950
01:38:15,646 --> 01:38:18,809
Boy, is he in for a surprise tonight.

951
01:38:19,183 --> 01:38:20,844
All right, for the cheers!

952
01:38:21,018 --> 01:38:22,747
- Give me an R!
- R!

953
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,544
- Give me an O!
- O!

954
01:38:24,756 --> 01:38:26,121
- Give me a C!
- C!

955
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:28,190
- Give me a K!
- K!

956
01:38:28,359 --> 01:38:29,724
- Give me a Y!
- Y!

957
01:38:29,994 --> 01:38:31,586
- What's it spell?
- Rocky!

958
01:38:31,763 --> 01:38:33,993
- I can't hear you!
- Rocky!

959
01:38:34,232 --> 01:38:36,291
- One more time!
- Rocky!

960
01:38:36,467 --> 01:38:37,593
- Give me an E!
- E!

961
01:38:37,769 --> 01:38:39,293
- Give me an A!
- A!

962
01:38:39,470 --> 01:38:42,234
- What kind of time we gonna have tonight?
- E-A!

963
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:57,303
Where did that
motorcyclist come from?

964
01:40:57,475 --> 01:40:59,204
I guess we'll have to turn back.

965
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:08,651
- What was that bang?
- Must have a blowout.

966
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,551
Damn it!

967
01:41:10,721 --> 01:41:14,782
- I should have gotten that spare fixed.
- Asshole!

968
01:41:14,959 --> 01:41:17,223
Stay here and keep warm.
I'll go for help.

969
01:41:17,395 --> 01:41:19,795
Where will you go in the middle of nowhere?

970
01:41:19,964 --> 01:41:23,456
What's white and sells hamburgers?

971
01:41:23,668 --> 01:41:26,637
Didn't we pass a castle down the road?

972
01:41:26,938 --> 01:41:29,031
Maybe they have a telephone.

973
01:41:29,206 --> 01:41:30,798
I'm going with you.

974
01:41:35,346 --> 01:41:37,576
Kick it!

975
01:41:41,652 --> 01:41:46,487
Hey, Janet! How about fries
to go with that shake?

976
01:41:50,728 --> 01:41:53,253
Take the risk!

977
01:42:00,204 --> 01:42:03,867
Hey, Riff, show us your mother!

978
01:42:21,859 --> 01:42:23,656
Watch the film.

979
01:42:54,859 --> 01:42:57,123
How's it go?

980
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:15,972
Oh, my God.

981
01:43:25,656 --> 01:43:27,681
- You did what?
- I got stoned.

982
01:43:28,392 --> 01:43:30,792
She took her top off.
She played with her bongos.

983
01:43:31,228 --> 01:43:33,287
- I did not!
- It was incredible!

984
01:43:33,464 --> 01:43:35,489
It was more than incredible, it was fun.

985
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:39,397
I felt naked when people looked at me
before. But they weren't looking at me...

986
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:42,698
...they were looking at someone
I put on. Like a costume.

987
01:43:43,074 --> 01:43:47,636
If I don't have a personality, so what?
I'm an actress.

988
01:43:47,845 --> 01:43:50,473
I can put on
as many personalities as I want.

989
01:43:50,648 --> 01:43:53,378
- To schizophrenia!
- Abso-fucking-lutely!

990
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:57,517
- Abso-fucking-what?
- You kids ready to order now?

991
01:43:58,155 --> 01:43:59,918
- Michael?
- Yeah.

992
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,187
You don't remember?

993
01:44:02,827 --> 01:44:04,988
Two years ago. I'm Doris Fin...

994
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:08,825
I was Doris Finsecker, when
you were a senior at P.A.

995
01:44:09,366 --> 01:44:13,359
- Yeah. Around the corner.
- You remember Montgomery MacNeil...

996
01:44:13,537 --> 01:44:15,835
...and Ralph Garci.
- Sure. Good old days.

997
01:44:16,407 --> 01:44:17,431
How was Hollywood?

998
01:44:17,908 --> 01:44:19,068
Slow.

999
01:44:19,343 --> 01:44:22,176
I met some people,
went to some parties.

1000
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:25,981
- I did a pilot for a series.
- I didn't see it.

1001
01:44:26,217 --> 01:44:27,650
Nobody saw it.

1002
01:44:28,052 --> 01:44:29,144
Sorry.

1003
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,153
- I did a couple of days as a male nurse.
- Did you?

1004
01:44:33,491 --> 01:44:35,391
On a soap.

1005
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,022
- I didn't like L.A. Too much.
- It sucks out there.

1006
01:44:39,396 --> 01:44:42,923
- Are you studying?
- I catch a class when I can.

1007
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,795
Hard times, you know?

1008
01:44:45,703 --> 01:44:48,228
- I read for a showcase.
- Oh, really?

1009
01:44:48,405 --> 01:44:50,373
I got a callback next week.

1010
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:52,539
- Hope you get it.
- Hey, good luck.

1011
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:53,968
Yeah.

1012
01:44:54,578 --> 01:44:55,670
Yeah.

1013
01:44:57,548 --> 01:44:58,913
What you kids having?

1014
01:44:59,216 --> 01:45:01,480
Got a special today on fried clams.

1015
01:45:01,785 --> 01:45:05,050
- Fried clams sound great.
- Yeah, that's fine.

1016
01:45:05,956 --> 01:45:09,790
- Fried clams is great.
- Yeah, sounds good.

1017
01:45:14,031 --> 01:45:16,124
Welcome to Catch a Rising Star.

1018
01:45:17,468 --> 01:45:19,902
Did anybody know it was Monday night?

1019
01:45:20,171 --> 01:45:23,937
Monday night is audition night.
Anybody from anywhere...

1020
01:45:24,108 --> 01:45:26,269
...can come up here and do
what they want.

1021
01:45:26,443 --> 01:45:28,968
You should see what walks in the room.

1022
01:45:29,146 --> 01:45:32,377
Some of the people that started here
were David Brenner...

1023
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:33,778
...Jimmie Walker...

1024
01:45:33,984 --> 01:45:38,444
...Gabe Kaplan, Freddie Prinze.
Maybe this next young man might...

1025
01:45:38,856 --> 01:45:40,551
...watch them on television.

1026
01:45:41,225 --> 01:45:44,786
Please welcome the comedy stylings...

1027
01:45:45,029 --> 01:45:48,021
...of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1028
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:55,031
Yay, Ralph!

1029
01:45:55,906 --> 01:45:56,895
Thank you.

1030
01:45:57,675 --> 01:46:00,576
Like Richard said, my name is Ralph Garci.

1031
01:46:00,744 --> 01:46:02,644
I'm a professional asshole.

1032
01:46:05,983 --> 01:46:09,441
I see we have a few
amateurs in the audience.

1033
01:46:11,088 --> 01:46:12,214
I have some...

1034
01:46:12,389 --> 01:46:17,088
Some. I have all of my friends here tonight.
From P.A. Graduating class.

1035
01:46:21,565 --> 01:46:24,056
It's very important to have friends.

1036
01:46:24,868 --> 01:46:26,631
I live in the South Bronx.

1037
01:46:28,372 --> 01:46:31,933
That's the country just north of Harlem
and west of Puerto Rico.

1038
01:46:32,109 --> 01:46:34,236
It's a very tough neighborhood.

1039
01:46:34,411 --> 01:46:36,072
The dogs carry knives.

1040
01:46:38,148 --> 01:46:40,946
Did you ever see a baby
with a zip gun?

1041
01:46:41,685 --> 01:46:46,122
You gotta have friends. You can't
alienate anybody up there. I mean nobody.

1042
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:49,953
Black people, white people, Chicanos,
Puerto Ricans, cockroaches.

1043
01:46:50,561 --> 01:46:53,394
You gotta respect cockroaches.
They got a good union.

1044
01:46:53,764 --> 01:46:58,167
Last week, 15,000 marched down my
block demanding better housing.

1045
01:47:00,304 --> 01:47:04,172
But I love the South Bronx.
Everywhere you go from there is up.

1046
01:47:05,209 --> 01:47:10,044
Everybody has dreams in the
South Bronx. I had dreams.

1047
01:47:10,414 --> 01:47:13,906
Stop your average boy
on a South Bronx street...

1048
01:47:14,718 --> 01:47:17,118
...and ask him
what he wants to be.

1049
01:47:17,521 --> 01:47:20,615
"I want to be an ex-junkie, man."

1050
01:47:21,725 --> 01:47:23,590
You can see them every day.

1051
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:28,095
You can't drive because of the dreams
on the streets being seen by cokeheads.

1052
01:47:28,265 --> 01:47:33,293
The minute that white line's laid down
the street, you got somebody going:

1053
01:47:34,538 --> 01:47:35,630
It's true.

1054
01:47:37,207 --> 01:47:39,835
And then there is sex.

1055
01:47:41,045 --> 01:47:42,444
Oh, yeah.

1056
01:47:42,813 --> 01:47:45,543
Kids are into sex earlier in South Bronx.

1057
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:48,177
Like about 6 a.m.

1058
01:47:52,623 --> 01:47:54,250
- You were wonderful.
- No.

1059
01:47:54,425 --> 01:47:57,394
- Really.
- I was good. I felt more than good.

1060
01:47:57,561 --> 01:47:59,620
- The guy wants me back.
- You're kidding!

1061
01:47:59,797 --> 01:48:01,492
He wants to book me regularly.

1062
01:48:01,665 --> 01:48:03,098
- Great!
- That's not great...

1063
01:48:03,267 --> 01:48:05,428
...it's fantastic! It's like electricity.

1064
01:48:05,602 --> 01:48:09,163
You're out there. Those faces are
out there, staring at you...

1065
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:12,776
...and you draw them in, then
you hit them with the juice.

1066
01:48:12,943 --> 01:48:17,141
And bam! They fucking explode!
And that power goes back and forth.

1067
01:48:17,314 --> 01:48:19,805
Next thing you know,
you're making them laugh.

1068
01:48:19,983 --> 01:48:23,612
That is the meanest high there is.
That beats dope. That beats sex.

1069
01:48:24,021 --> 01:48:27,286
I love fucking acting!

1070
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:30,983
With my money, we can get
a place. We can get married maybe.

1071
01:48:31,161 --> 01:48:35,427
I'll have $20,000 a week, a hit
TV series, my face on TV Guide!

1072
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:36,691
- Wait!
- What?

1073
01:48:36,867 --> 01:48:40,633
- What about me? Don't I get a career?
- A career? I'll give you a career.

1074
01:48:40,838 --> 01:48:46,003
How about Shakespeare in the Park
and you get to win 17 Tony awards?

1075
01:48:46,276 --> 01:48:49,177
- All right. Bye.
- All right. Okay. Bye.

1076
01:48:50,948 --> 01:48:52,575
Don't mug anybody.

1077
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:56,076
- Don't rape anybody.
- I'll rape you.

1078
01:48:56,253 --> 01:48:57,652
Don't rape anybody, okay?

1079
01:48:57,821 --> 01:48:59,448
I'll see you later. Take care.

1080
01:49:04,628 --> 01:49:05,856
You see...

1081
01:49:07,064 --> 01:49:10,465
...Ive been offered this place
with the San Francisco Ballet.

1082
01:49:10,634 --> 01:49:13,694
I haven't told anyone yet,
but I'm gonna take it.

1083
01:49:13,871 --> 01:49:15,998
I don't care what they think.

1084
01:49:16,573 --> 01:49:19,007
I'm a good dancer. Better than good.

1085
01:49:19,243 --> 01:49:21,711
Maybe even the best in the school.

1086
01:49:22,579 --> 01:49:26,015
That's not conceit.
It's just simple honesty.

1087
01:49:27,184 --> 01:49:31,712
If I stay in New York, everybody will think
I bought my way into ABT.

1088
01:49:32,022 --> 01:49:37,119
I'm not starving myself to death
for Balanchine's City Ballet.

1089
01:49:38,295 --> 01:49:41,731
Not that I mind doing
the corps de ballet bullshit.

1090
01:49:42,332 --> 01:49:44,823
I'd sooner do it out of town.

1091
01:49:46,437 --> 01:49:49,031
I'll pay my dues on the West Coast.

1092
01:49:49,873 --> 01:49:52,637
Come back to New York as a star.

1093
01:49:55,446 --> 01:49:56,674
You see...

1094
01:49:57,481 --> 01:50:00,075
...Ive always had this crazy dream...

1095
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:04,016
...of dancing all the classical
roles before I'm 21.

1096
01:50:05,689 --> 01:50:09,648
I want Giselles and Coppelias
coming out of my feet.

1097
01:50:10,227 --> 01:50:12,252
And Sleeping Beauties...

1098
01:50:12,729 --> 01:50:14,720
...and the Swan.

1099
01:50:16,333 --> 01:50:19,393
I want bravos in Stuttgart and Leningrad...

1100
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:21,128
...and Paris.

1101
01:50:22,406 --> 01:50:25,864
Maybe even a ballet
created especially for me.

1102
01:50:29,179 --> 01:50:30,669
You see...

1103
01:50:31,348 --> 01:50:34,181
...there's no room for a baby.

1104
01:50:35,152 --> 01:50:38,679
Will this be Master Charge
or American Express, honey?

1105
01:50:47,498 --> 01:50:48,795
Excuse me.

1106
01:50:50,033 --> 01:50:51,796
You're an actress, aren't you?

1107
01:50:52,169 --> 01:50:53,534
I might be.

1108
01:50:54,371 --> 01:50:56,202
A Chorus Line, right?

1109
01:50:56,640 --> 01:51:00,337
Aren't you the one that does that
hot, smoky number in the red dress?

1110
01:51:00,911 --> 01:51:03,675
I'm right, ain't I? I knew it.

1111
01:51:04,214 --> 01:51:08,150
Boy, let me tell you, you are
the best thing in that show.

1112
01:51:09,786 --> 01:51:13,517
I guess you get tired of hearing that.
Excuse me.

1113
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:15,214
No, I don't.

1114
01:51:16,727 --> 01:51:18,524
You don't belong there.

1115
01:51:18,862 --> 01:51:21,262
If you don't mind my
saying so, you're a star.

1116
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:23,194
You need a show all to yourself.

1117
01:51:23,433 --> 01:51:27,733
- You've got a lovely face, a delicious figure.
- I sing too.

1118
01:51:27,905 --> 01:51:29,429
- No.
- And play the piano.

1119
01:51:29,706 --> 01:51:32,470
That's what I mean. But it's
more than just talent...

1120
01:51:32,643 --> 01:51:34,702
...it's a certain quality.

1121
01:51:34,945 --> 01:51:37,880
You're the kind of girl that
stands out in a room.

1122
01:51:38,115 --> 01:51:41,141
This might sound a little
presumptuous of me...

1123
01:51:41,985 --> 01:51:44,044
I should probably
just call your agent.

1124
01:51:44,688 --> 01:51:48,988
- I don't really relate to agents.
- Don't blame you. Don't blame you at all.

1125
01:51:49,226 --> 01:51:52,627
Listen, my name is Francois.
Francois Lafete.

1126
01:51:52,996 --> 01:51:54,020
Coco.

1127
01:51:54,398 --> 01:51:57,663
Coco? Coco? That's terrific!

1128
01:51:57,968 --> 01:52:02,029
Listen, Coco, I'm doing this picture
down in the south of France, you know?

1129
01:52:02,739 --> 01:52:05,299
I was wondering if...

1130
01:52:06,109 --> 01:52:08,703
...maybe you'd like to do
a screen test for me.

1131
01:52:12,583 --> 01:52:14,050
Are you serious?

1132
01:52:20,657 --> 01:52:22,147
Bunsky.

1133
01:52:22,526 --> 01:52:23,925
Hey, Bunsky.

1134
01:52:25,028 --> 01:52:26,086
You seen Sherwood?

1135
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:28,423
She's with her husband.

1136
01:52:28,599 --> 01:52:31,295
- I didn't know she had a husband.
- He's sick, Leroy.

1137
01:52:31,702 --> 01:52:33,499
He'd have to be to be her husband.

1138
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:36,366
He's quite bad.
In the hospital, anyway.

1139
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:38,405
- Hospital?
- Apparently.

1140
01:52:38,942 --> 01:52:40,603
Okay, Schlepstein.

1141
01:53:08,405 --> 01:53:10,498
Leroy. What are you doing here?

1142
01:53:13,877 --> 01:53:15,606
You ever heard of Alvin Ailey?

1143
01:53:15,812 --> 01:53:17,109
Alvin Ailey?

1144
01:53:17,614 --> 01:53:18,740
He's a...

1145
01:53:19,383 --> 01:53:20,850
He's a choreographer?

1146
01:53:24,685 --> 01:53:26,619
I'm sorry, Leroy, but this isn't the time...

1147
01:53:30,891 --> 01:53:33,519
- I have to pass.
- Should've thought of it four years ago.

1148
01:53:33,661 --> 01:53:35,629
Where I'm from
it don't pay to read and speak white.

1149
01:53:38,265 --> 01:53:39,630
You been hard on me since day one.

1150
01:53:42,336 --> 01:53:44,600
Whatever you say,
Leroy. Go home.

1151
01:53:44,772 --> 01:53:47,969
I stopped going home!
You never knew that, did you?

1152
01:53:48,142 --> 01:53:52,511
You people make a big deal about pulling us
out of the gutter, yet you won't eat with us.

1153
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:55,342
You know where that leaves people
like me? Nowhere!

1154
01:53:55,516 --> 01:53:59,680
- This is not the time. I don't want to hear it.
- You're going to hear it!

1155
01:53:59,853 --> 01:54:03,789
- I'm gonna be a good dancer!
- Just get out of here, please!

1156
01:54:04,024 --> 01:54:07,050
- You will not keep me down...
- Leave me alone!

1157
01:54:07,227 --> 01:54:12,324
...because I can't read stories I see on TV!
- Don't you kids think of anyone but yourself?

1158
01:54:32,386 --> 01:54:33,375
Hey.

1159
01:54:34,054 --> 01:54:35,988
How's your old man doing?

1160
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:37,679
Shit.

1161
01:54:42,262 --> 01:54:43,251
Here.

1162
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:46,791
Thank you.

1163
01:55:49,163 --> 01:55:53,566
Coco. Bonjour. You made it. Come on in.

1164
01:55:56,904 --> 01:55:59,930
- Am I early?
- Don't be silly. Let me take your coat.

1165
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:02,601
- Where's the crew?
- You're looking at him.

1166
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:05,973
I must have total control of
the creative product.

1167
01:56:06,146 --> 01:56:07,579
Like Godard.

1168
01:56:08,515 --> 01:56:11,746
- Jean-Luc Godard? Ever hear of that guy?
- French?

1169
01:56:14,288 --> 01:56:16,722
- You ever see any of his pictures?
- Sure.

1170
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:18,881
Then you know what I'm talking about.

1171
01:56:19,927 --> 01:56:24,387
You see, I belong, sort of, to the
auteur school of filmmaking.

1172
01:56:24,565 --> 01:56:26,089
It's like the...

1173
01:56:26,266 --> 01:56:29,633
It's like the Mediterranean
approach, you know what I mean?

1174
01:56:30,971 --> 01:56:33,371
- Do you want a beer?
- No, thanks. I'm okay.

1175
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:37,237
- It might relax you.
- It's all right. I have a lot on my mind.

1176
01:56:37,411 --> 01:56:38,708
I understand.

1177
01:56:40,647 --> 01:56:42,478
- What?
- Come here.

1178
01:56:43,851 --> 01:56:47,218
That's it. I want you to sit right here.

1179
01:56:47,387 --> 01:56:52,347
We're gonna do a lovely close-up
of that beautiful face.

1180
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,761
I get nervous at first with cold readings,
but then I'm all right.

1181
01:56:56,930 --> 01:57:00,093
Don't worry about that.
We'll get to the dialogue later.

1182
01:57:00,868 --> 01:57:05,567
- So, you like art movies, huh, Coco?
- Antonioni and those people? Sure.

1183
01:57:05,739 --> 01:57:08,173
It beats watching Laverne & Shirley.

1184
01:57:08,342 --> 01:57:11,641
Coco, you don't know
what you're doing to my lens.

1185
01:57:14,114 --> 01:57:16,378
You have a natural rapport
with the camera.

1186
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:19,849
It's unbelievable. Some performers
can make love to the camera.

1187
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:21,419
Garbo did.

1188
01:57:21,855 --> 01:57:23,447
Monroe did.

1189
01:57:24,825 --> 01:57:26,019
So could you.

1190
01:57:26,393 --> 01:57:28,418
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

1191
01:57:28,862 --> 01:57:31,023
Could you take your top off, please?

1192
01:57:34,801 --> 01:57:37,895
- What?
- Could you take your blouse off?

1193
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:42,038
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

1194
01:57:43,176 --> 01:57:46,077
What's the matter?
You're acting like some dumb kid.

1195
01:57:46,246 --> 01:57:48,680
- I thought you were a professional.
- I am.

1196
01:57:48,849 --> 01:57:50,783
Well, then what's the problem?

1197
01:58:03,297 --> 01:58:05,094
I can't.

1198
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:16,505
That's better.

1199
01:58:18,045 --> 01:58:19,478
That's lovely.

1200
01:58:21,348 --> 01:58:23,009
Oh, yeah.

1201
01:58:24,851 --> 01:58:28,912
Yeah. Could you arch your back?
Arch your back a little, Coco.

1202
01:58:32,492 --> 01:58:34,722
Smile for me, Coco.

1203
01:58:35,062 --> 01:58:39,965
Come on, Coco. Smile, smile.
Smile for me.

1204
01:58:41,134 --> 01:58:42,931
Now take your thumb...

1205
01:58:43,103 --> 01:58:44,798
...and put it in your mouth...

1206
01:58:44,972 --> 01:58:47,497
...like a little schoolgirl.

1207
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:52,340
You ever notice that
black news reporters...

1208
01:58:52,512 --> 01:58:55,345
...get hired because
they have white accents?

1209
01:58:55,515 --> 01:58:58,916
They should hire a more natural guy,
a dude from the street.

1210
01:58:59,319 --> 01:59:00,911
"This is Rufus X with the news..."

1211
01:59:03,323 --> 01:59:04,847
I need something.

1212
01:59:05,025 --> 01:59:06,390
Sleep.

1213
01:59:07,094 --> 01:59:09,654
- Something to keep me flying.
- Like what?

1214
01:59:10,097 --> 01:59:12,895
Like by way of your witch doctor.

1215
01:59:13,166 --> 01:59:15,566
I don't see Dr. Golden anymore.
You know that.

1216
01:59:16,036 --> 01:59:17,936
Anyway, you've been taking too much.

1217
01:59:18,105 --> 01:59:20,869
- Thanks, Marcus Welby.
- I know what I'm talking about.

1218
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:23,441
Why don't you get off my fucking case?

1219
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:26,408
- I'm your friend.
- You're my friend? Really?

1220
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:30,243
I know what you've been
after, you goddamn faggot.

1221
01:59:34,421 --> 01:59:36,286
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1222
01:59:38,558 --> 01:59:39,786
Good. You do that.

1223
01:59:44,564 --> 01:59:45,258
- Hi. You got a problem?
- Yeah, I do.

1224
01:59:45,698 --> 01:59:47,529
We never see you anymore.

1225
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,267
You see me plenty.

1226
01:59:52,105 --> 01:59:53,504
After the show is important.

1227
01:59:55,575 --> 01:59:57,702
You meet people. That's what counts.

1228
01:59:57,877 --> 02:00:00,744
I hate drinking. I'm doing this
for my future. For our future.

1229
02:00:00,914 --> 02:00:04,179
You're doing this for some image,
for Freddie because he did it.

1230
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:06,784
- Yeah? Maybe.
- Yeah? Well, he died doing it.

1231
02:00:07,053 --> 02:00:09,214
- He could have been a real actor.
- He was!

1232
02:00:09,389 --> 02:00:13,155
He was funny and charming
and he made people laugh. That's it.

1233
02:00:13,326 --> 02:00:16,762
- That's plenty!
- That's not enough! Not for you!

1234
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,795
- Jesus Christ!
- You are good, Ralph.

1235
02:00:18,965 --> 02:00:21,433
- You're seriously really good.
- Jesus.

1236
02:00:21,601 --> 02:00:26,436
You're full of rage and pain and love.
Not just jokes. You're an original.

1237
02:00:26,606 --> 02:00:28,540
The original Ralph Garci.

1238
02:00:28,808 --> 02:00:32,471
- You don't have to be somebody else.
- You're bringing me down!

1239
02:00:32,645 --> 02:00:35,239
- You're bringing me fucking down!
- I'm sorry!

1240
02:00:35,415 --> 02:00:39,476
I gotta go make people laugh, and
you're talking about rage and pain.

1241
02:00:39,652 --> 02:00:42,177
- I said I'm sorry!
- It takes fucking wings.

1242
02:00:42,355 --> 02:00:45,620
Miss Seriously, let me tear flypaper, huh?

1243
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:48,093
Give me a fucking break, honey!

1244
02:00:48,261 --> 02:00:51,924
Give me a fucking break.
Okay, pal? Thank you.

1245
02:00:54,934 --> 02:00:58,836
- What's happening to you?
- What's happening to me? Success.

1246
02:00:59,005 --> 02:01:03,032
Now, you either hang on or hang up.
All right?

1247
02:01:08,681 --> 02:01:12,447
It's a great pleasure to introduce
a young man who's funny and loud.

1248
02:01:12,619 --> 02:01:13,950
Especially during my act.

1249
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:18,079
Please welcome the comedy stylings
of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1250
02:01:20,593 --> 02:01:25,860
That's right. My name is Ralph Garci,
and I'm a professional asshole.

1251
02:01:29,836 --> 02:01:35,069
That's right. I see we have a couple
of amateurs in the audience tonight.

1252
02:01:35,508 --> 02:01:37,135
Don't we?

1253
02:01:38,544 --> 02:01:41,274
I see. How about sign language?

1254
02:01:41,447 --> 02:01:45,008
We have a standing ovation
over there.

1255
02:01:45,418 --> 02:01:48,683
That's great. Hon, where you from?

1256
02:01:49,622 --> 02:01:53,991
Okey-dokey. That's my best friend.

1257
02:01:55,528 --> 02:01:57,428
Yeah, friends are important.

1258
02:01:58,898 --> 02:02:03,028
I live in the South Bronx, and up there,
you got the Harlems of...

1259
02:02:03,336 --> 02:02:07,238
Shit! I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Fuck it.

1260
02:02:07,674 --> 02:02:09,198
That was supposed to be...

1261
02:02:09,709 --> 02:02:13,805
The north... The countries north
of Harlem and west of Puerto Rico.

1262
02:02:14,247 --> 02:02:16,943
That's what it was supposed to be.
Yes, indeed it was.

1263
02:02:17,116 --> 02:02:19,175
Anyway, there's lots of things there:

1264
02:02:19,352 --> 02:02:23,220
Rats, cockroaches,
and, you know, little bugs.

1265
02:02:23,389 --> 02:02:27,052
You know what cockroaches are?
Little things that crawl in the night.

1266
02:02:29,062 --> 02:02:33,692
Listen, I don't mean to alarm you,
but if you don't laugh, you'll get cancer.

1267
02:02:35,868 --> 02:02:40,032
Sorry. That was probably in bad taste,
and I didn't really...

1268
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:48,542
Excuse me. Fuck it.
Thank you very much.

1269
02:03:09,769 --> 02:03:10,895
What do you want?

1270
02:03:11,637 --> 02:03:13,798
Pizza sounds good.
You wanna eat?

1271
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:17,373
Could you give me a break, all right?

1272
02:03:17,844 --> 02:03:20,779
We could split a special,
with anchovies, maybe.

1273
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:26,347
Anchovies? Fuck anchovies. I died out there
tonight, you're talking about fucking pizzas?

1274
02:03:26,519 --> 02:03:32,082
- No, I'm talking about eating pizzas.
- Oh, that's very funny. You're a howl.

1275
02:03:32,258 --> 02:03:35,352
You should have been out there.
The audience hated me.

1276
02:03:35,528 --> 02:03:39,862
- You had a bad night, man. That happens.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

1277
02:03:40,032 --> 02:03:43,297
What do you want? Insurance?
You're in the wrong business.

1278
02:03:43,469 --> 02:03:46,404
Performers aren't safe.
We're pie-in-the-face people.

1279
02:03:46,572 --> 02:03:49,905
Look, don't lecture me.
All right, Sir Laurence?

1280
02:03:50,076 --> 02:03:54,012
All anyone ever promised you
was seven classes a day and a hot lunch.

1281
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:55,947
The rest is up to you.

1282
02:03:56,115 --> 02:04:00,677
Back in the Middle Ages, actors,
they didn't even want to bury us.

1283
02:04:01,687 --> 02:04:03,416
Well, they do now.

1284
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:06,784
Not if you're good.

1285
02:04:08,561 --> 02:04:10,290
How do you know?

1286
02:04:11,264 --> 02:04:13,994
How do you know if you're good?

1287
02:04:14,167 --> 02:04:16,294
Maybe you never know.

1288
02:04:21,674 --> 02:04:25,132
You just hang in, I guess.

1289
02:04:29,515 --> 02:04:31,449
You know the weirdest thing...

1290
02:04:32,285 --> 02:04:34,116
...is Freddie.

1291
02:04:34,987 --> 02:04:39,185
When he made it, he realized
it was everything he hated.

1292
02:04:39,759 --> 02:04:41,818
Cadillac Eldorado.

1293
02:04:41,994 --> 02:04:44,087
Pocketful of Quaaludes.

1294
02:04:44,263 --> 02:04:45,730
Johnny Carson.

1295
02:04:45,898 --> 02:04:48,025
It was no special shit.

1296
02:04:48,334 --> 02:04:50,564
You're not Freddie, Ralph.

1297
02:04:50,736 --> 02:04:53,227
I know that. I know.

1298
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:58,909
Know something else about Freddie?
Freddie didn't even want to be Freddie.

1299
02:04:59,078 --> 02:05:03,208
- No?
- No. He wanted to be Joe Namath.

1300
02:05:05,551 --> 02:05:06,813
You laughed.

1301
02:05:06,986 --> 02:05:09,648
- Guess I'm funny.
- Let's get out of here.

1302
02:05:22,201 --> 02:05:23,395
5'7"?

1303
02:05:30,343 --> 02:05:32,971
Okay, you're finished.
Stand over there.

1304
02:05:33,145 --> 02:05:35,773
Go on. Keep the line moving.
Come on.

1305
02:13:33,583 --> 02:13:34,572
{{{the end}}}
