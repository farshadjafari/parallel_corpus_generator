516
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,884

of the word "zombie"</i>

529
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,410

530

<i>We haven't had contact with them since.</i>

531
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,684
<i>But this could lead us to the origin.</i>

532
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,523
<i>If we knew where this thing started,</i>

533
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,682
<i>then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.</i>

534
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:45,604

<i>You want to tell me why?</i>

682
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,085

695
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,286
<i>Yeah. Sound draws them.</i>

696
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:40,041
<i>Body shots only seem
to slow them down.</i>

697
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,599

<i>If the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?</i>

709
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,762
<i>There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.</i>

710
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,320
<i>It had the word "zombie" in it.</i>

711

<i>Do you know anything about it?</i>

<i>Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.</i>

716
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,764
<i>Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten</i>

<i>trying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.</i>

718
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,489
