2
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,163
Stop!

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,596
You're supposed to stop
for people who need help.

4
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,335
Uh-uh, not so fast, Barry Allen.
Forget about them.

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,132
You can't change other people.
Just a waste of energy.

6
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:31,740
- But…
- Barry…

7
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,606
When I was a little girl,
Grandma taught me a prayer:

8
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,975
Accept the things you cannot change.

9
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,378
Have the courage
to change the things you can,

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,383
and have the wisdom
to know the difference.

11
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,445
I don't totally get that.

12
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,319
Heh, you will.

13
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,618
Now, all we need is a phone.

14
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,262
There's a gas station.

15
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,960
- Race you.
- Barry!

16
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,203
Mom.

17
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,692
And we may never know
exactly what happened...

18
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:05,837
A break-in gone wrong,
a disturbed mind.

19
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:10,235
But we do know that this was a crime
and a tragedy.

20
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:14,468
And as we commit Nora
to the care of our Lord,

21
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:19,413
we know her son, Barry, will need
all our prayers and help to see him

22
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,414
<i>through this terrible loss.</i>

23
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:28,920
Happy birthday, Mom.
I'm so sorry.

24
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,391
- I should've been there.
- What?

25
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,430
If I just ran a little faster,
I'd have been there.

26
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:38,728
Barry, you were just a boy.
There was nothing you could've done.

27
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,098
We don't know that.

28
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,002
If I'd been there,
maybe I could’ve stopped it.

29
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,362
I could’ve saved her.

30
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,206
Come on, stop doing this to yourself.

31
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:48,106
What was that saying your mother had?

32
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,942
About accepting the things
you can't change?

33
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,586
Well, this is something I can change.

34
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:04,659
A break-in at the Flash Museum.

35
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,661
- See you later?
- You better.

36
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,284
Well, Flash.

37
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:38,896
Once again, it looks like you're the bottom
and I'm the Top.

38
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,103
Mirror Master and Heat Wave.

39
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,106
Going to a lot of trouble
to steal my old junk, aren't you?

40
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,096
Exhibit's closed, Top.

41
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,939
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

42
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,803
Captains Boomerang and Cold.

43
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,177
The gang's all here.

44
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:10,845
And I thought you forgot about us
as soon as you sent us off to prison.

45
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,250
So this little reunion is about revenge?

46
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,656
Not really.
Offing you is just a bonus part of the job.

47
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,557
Job? Who hired you?

48
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,165
No offense, heh, none of you clowns
are smart enough to pull this off.

49
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,562
You're quite right, of course, Flash.

50
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,273
I knew using these morons
would put you off your guard.

51
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,273
- Hey.
- They're motivated by greed.

52
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,776
They lack the commitment,
the absolute focus...

53
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,108
- To kill me.
- Erase you.

54
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,411
I'm gonna bring this shrine to your ego
down on your head.

55
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,454
Along with 10 square blocks
of Central City and everyone around.

56
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,057
What? What are you talking about?
We didn't bring any bombs.

57
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,956
Oh, but I did.

58
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,168
- What is this?
- Something I attached to your belts

59
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,769
as I made my entrance.

60
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,437
I wouldn't unbuckle if I were you.
You'll just set them off.

61
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,870
It's me you want, Thawne.

62
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,944
You don't have to kill
thousands of innocents to bring me down.

63
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,673
No. No, I don't.

64
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:17,220
But I choose to, knowing it will
make your last moments pure agony.

65
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,576
Good bye.

66
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,353
You can't escape, Flash.

67
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:28,896
The adhesive will never completely liquefy,
regardless of speed.

68
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm counting on that. Unh.

69
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,470
Now you got no choice, Thawne.

70
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,302
Disarm the bombs
or you blow up with us.

71
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Very well.

72
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,471
If it means shattering
your golden throne in history,

73
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,981
linking your name forever
to this city's darkest hour,

74
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,677
then my life is a small price to pay.

75
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,180
I agree.

76
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,490
Your lives aren't worth much.

77
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:04,197
But Flash's life is.

78
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:16,042
- You called them.
- You've got your posse, I've got mine.

79
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,613
Clearly, you should never do this stuff
without me.

80
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,613
You end up with crap all over yourself.

81
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,454
Focus, GL. Bombs. Batman?

82
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,021
It's future tech.

83
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,059
Difficult to disarm without
setting them off, even for me.

84
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,819
I could try to vaporize the bombs.

85
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,930
Yes, but you'd be vaporizing
the Rogues as well.

86
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:38,000
Diana's right. What's plan B?

87
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,240
How do we shut off these charges?

88
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:47,403
You can't. We'll all be dead, shortly.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,673
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

90
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,076
We're out of options.

91
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,514
Each of you take one of the Rogues
as far from Central City as you can.

92
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:57,745
We'll attempt to disarm the devices
once sufficiently isolated.

93
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,322
I'm not going to just leave you here.

94
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,358
Lantern, we're running out of time.

95
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,860
Hal, go.

96
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,250
- I'd suck it in if I were you.
- Uh?

97
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,335
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- I am.

98
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,802
I've got a million microbes
eating the bomb's wiring.

99
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,746
Waiting is the worst part.

100
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,503
You may have minimized
the destruction,

101
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,732
but the final bomb will still turn
this monument to your ego

102
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,466
into your own tomb.

103
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,780
What are you doing?
You can't escape.

104
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:41,884
You can't reach the bomb to disarm it.
You're going to die.

105
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,044
You may have my powers, Thawne,

106
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:50,388
but you have almost zero imagination
about using them.

107
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,025
Lacks like 25th-century technology
is pretty delicate.

108
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:14,143
I've notified S.T.A.R. Labs to ready a
cozy little cell for you, Professor.

109
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,581
I understand the food's not great there,
Zoom.

110
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,881
Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash.

111
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:24,791
But no matter how fast you run,
you can't save everyone.

112
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,556
Not the ones that matter to you.

113
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,533
Best to keep your mouth shut
if you don't want bugs in your teeth.

114
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,633
Thawne's a classic sociopath.

115
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,802
They have a knack for knowing
just what will get under your skin.

116
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,504
Yeah. They do.

117
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,116
You okay?

118
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,514
Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine.

119
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,951
Nothing I can't run off.

120
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:10,013
Subripped by Reef
addic7ed.com

121
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:17,213
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

122
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:23,509
I don't mean to interrupt your beauty
sleep, Lord knows you need it,

123
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,623
but the Elongated Kid murderer
isn't gonna catch himself.

124
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:30,317
- Elongated Man was murdered?
- Elongated <i>Kid.</i>

125
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,523
What?

126
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:37,326
Director Singh wants us pulling
all-nighters until we close this case.

127
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,690
Hey, what's going on?

128
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,102
<i>We interrupt our programming
to bring breaking news.</i>

129
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,898
We're live outside the Cold Museum.

130
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,042
<i>Citizen Cold
is battling Captain Boomerang.</i>

131
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,667
<i>Reportedly, the confrontation began
inside the museum moments ago.</i>

132
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,370
Cold is on the loose already?

133
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,981
Do we really have to learn
this stuff on TV?

134
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,176
Doesn't anyone call the cops anymore?

135
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,251
Looks like a power struggle
in the Rogues.

136
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,389
- Who are the Rogues?
- The Rogues.

137
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:00,750
Flash's worst enemies…?

138
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,826
Bent on Flash's destruction,
so they can take over Central City?

139
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,056
Okay, we'll continue
this hilarious leg-pulling later.

140
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,995
After the Flash has taken care
of Citizen Cold.

141
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,076
Barry, are you all right?

142
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,701
<i>Mom?</i>

143
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,217
Mom.

144
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,482
Oh, that was a nasty spill,
even for you.

145
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,059
Let me see your head.

146
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:42,495
I'm fine. Mom.

147
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:46,532
It's you. You're here.

148
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,534
Heh, well, of course I'm here.

149
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:51,334
You promised me
you'd take me to dinner on my birthday.

150
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:55,411
It's my birthday.
The end of the world can't stop that.

151
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,615
You forgot. Heh, it's okay, Barry.

152
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:05,619
It's easy for a busy young man
to forget his old mom.

153
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,620
I could never forget you.

154
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,062
Oh, heh. Oh, my.

155
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:21,296
Barry, what's gotten into you?
Are you all right?

156
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,533
People have been acting so strangely with
this terrible war hanging over their heads.

157
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:28,576
War? What? No, Mom, I'm fine.

158
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,341
But everything else has changed,
and I have to find out why.

159
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,643
It probably has something
to do with me being...

160
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,116
- Gay?
- What? No.

161
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,653
It's okay. I lave you no matter what.

162
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:44,488
Mom, it's not that. It's something else.

163
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,461
Brace yourself for a shock.

164
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,230
I'm the Flash.

165
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,498
What's "the Flash?"

166
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,734
You know, the Flash.
Fastest man alive?

167
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,606
Fights crime?
Very famous superhero?

168
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:07,409
A superhero?
Heh, you mean like Batman?

169
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,927
Where's the Joker? Unh.

170
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,822
Where, Yo-Yo?

171
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,036
Tell me where the Joker's funhouse
is this time.

172
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:35,763
While you can still talk.

173
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,767
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. Ow.

174
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,769
Let me help you get it off.

175
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,985
Judge Dent was kidnapped last night.
Where did the Joker take him?

176
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,620
Even if I did know,
it wouldn't do you any good, Bats.

177
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,784
- He's probably already dead.
- Then so are you.

178
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:13,440
Cyborg? I surrender.

179
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,306
To you.

180
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,809
Smart.

181
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,548
- Batman.
- You should have let her hit the pavement.

182
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,314
- You shouldn't have thrown her.
- She slipped.

183
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,184
- Aren't you wondering how I found you?
- Thermal vision.

184
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,547
Cybernetic hearing.

185
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,594
And total access to every camera
on the grid.

186
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,061
Must be a nice perk for being
in the president's back pocket.

187
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,029
I've told you it's not like that.

188
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,670
As national security adviser,
I can help more people.

189
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,067
Like that murdering psychopath?

190
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,935
Maybe you should go help people
in some other town.

191
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,873
We're trying to help all the people,

192
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:50,411
while there's still a world left.
We need you.

193
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,377
We...?

194
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:57,115
Hologram party. Ingenious.

195
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,153
Saves a fortune on snacks.

196
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:06,023
Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold,
Shade, Sandman, The Shazam Kids.

197
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:10,326
It's Batman. Seriously, Batman.

198
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,163
- He's older than I thought.
- But I'm not hard of hearing.

199
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,369
You know why we're here, Batman.
War.

200
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,771
Over 100 million people died

201
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:25,143
when Atlantis sank
Western Europe into the ocean.

202
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,442
Another 32 million slaughtered,

203
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,882
when the Amazons
invaded the United Kingdom

204
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,884
and renamed it New Themyscira.

205
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,250
We have to take down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman

206
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,552
before their war destroys
what's left of the world.

207
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,329
- We can do it.
- That's exactly what Captain Atom said,

208
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,798
before he flew over there and vanished.

209
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,426
He went in without a plan or backup.
That's where you come in.

210
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:52,132
If we want to win this thing, we need
the best tactician on the planet.

211
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,242
You.

212
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,881
You can't just turn your back on this.

213
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,107
Not when we've got a chance to stop
this war and save the world.

214
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:05,346
War's over, soldier.
You just don't know it yet.

215
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,387
Everybody lost.

216
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:24,231
- Can I help you, sir?
- Sir? Doris, it's me.

217
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:33,641
No, I don't need help.
Everything's fine now.

218
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,647
<i>Mommy.</i>

219
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:42,080
- How is my little angel?
- Awesome.

220
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,421
Daddy took me out to lunch
and we had chicken wings,

221
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:50,431
and I told him about the invasion drill
we had at school today.

222
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:24,462
Bruce? Alfred?

223
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,552
What happened to you, Bruce?

224
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:47,247
You were the James Bond
of superheroes.

225
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,584
What turned you into the Unabomber?

226
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,763
Who are you?

227
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:02,098
I said who the hell are you?

228
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,871
Bruce, wait. You have to remember.
It's me. It's Barry.

229
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,104
Barry Allen. Bruce?

230
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,713
- Bruce?
- Bruce.

231
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:14,680
Bruce is dead. I watched him die.

232
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,443
My God.

233
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,487
He's the one who died
that night in the alley.

234
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:24,115
Bruce died and you lived.
You're his father.

235
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,657
You're Thomas Wayne.

236
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,361
Pilgrim to Mayflower, do you copy?

237
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:38,236
Where the hell are you?
I'm at the rendezvous point.

238
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,640
There's no sign of the package
or any other members of the resistance.

239
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,711
And I'm up to my neck in Amazons.

240
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,340
You're an American.

241
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,136
But you're going to tell me
a little more about yourself.

242
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,837
- Who are you?
- No. Ugh.

243
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,711
He's resisting the Lasso of Truth.

244
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,182
How is that possible, Queen Diana?

245
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,116
It's not.

246
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,189
Who are you, and what are you doing
in New Themyscira?

247
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,859
My name is Colonel Steve Trevor
of the United States Special Forces.

248
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:41,596
- I'm here to retrieve Lois Lane.
- Who is Lois Lane?

249
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,104
Lois Lane is a Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist

250
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:47,038
who's been embedded
in New Themyscira for three months,

251
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,108
gathering intel
on your Amazons for Cyborg.

252
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:52,613
She's, unh... She's also one of the most
beautiful woman I've ever met.

253
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,971
Until now, you mean.

254
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,855
Our information was correct.

255
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:59,012
Cyborg is amassing the outside
world's super-humans,

256
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:01,123
in an attempt
to interfere with our war.

257
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:05,125
He will fail.
Now, find me this Lois Lane.

258
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:10,028
Yes, my Queen.
May I deal with the prisoner for you?

259
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,387
No.

260
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,996
The Queen of the Amazons
is a servant to her people.

261
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:21,236
Nothing is beneath her.

262
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,926
I told you, everything changed.

263
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,119
You have nine more fingers.

264
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,130
I suggest you tell me
how you found out about me.

265
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,935
In my world,
I'm a hero named the Flash.

266
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,164
Bruce took me here, showed me...

267
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,867
I used to be a doctor.

268
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,773
Mention my dead son again and I will
break out my surgical instruments.

269
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:12,786
My ring. Let me show you
that I'm telling the truth.

270
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,295
My uniform is in that ring.

271
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,291
I'll humor you.

272
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,037
See? I told…

273
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:33,094
Not what you were expecting?

274
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,715
- No. Thawne.
- Who?

275
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,822
The man this uniform belongs to.

276
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,424
My opposite, the Reverse-Flash.
Eobard Thawne.

277
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:47,086
- What kind of name is <i>Eobard?</i>
- The 25th-century kind.

278
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:50,721
He replicated the accident that allowed me
to tap into the Speed Force,

279
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:52,993
became a criminal,
Professor Zoom.

280
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:54,357
"Speed Force?"

281
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:59,134
The Speed Force allows both of us to bend
the laws of physics using super speed.

282
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,334
He can travel through time.

283
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,508
You're suggesting that he changed
something in the past...

284
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,344
That changed everything. It's crazy.

285
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,249
My mom's alive. You're Batman.

286
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,255
And Diana and Arthur
are about to start World War Ill.

287
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,750
But why give me this?

288
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:22,259
He hates you.

289
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,026
So much he'll destroy everything
to kill you.

290
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,830
But his psychosis requires
that you know he's responsible.

291
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:31,634
Could anyone, even Thawne,
be that deranged?

292
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:39,375
You'd be amazed the monsters
this world can create.

293
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,717
We have to stop this, Dr. Wayne.

294
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,750
Catch Thawne,
find out what he changed,

295
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,480
and change it back before Aquaman
and Wonder Woman

296
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:48,521
kill everyone on the planet.

297
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,651
Not saying I believe you,
but in your reality...

298
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,798
- Is my son...?
- Bruce is alive.

299
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,900
He's Batman.

300
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,269
If I were to help you,
what exactly would we need?

301
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:07,136
Just what's over there
and unbelievably bad weather.

302
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,577
Welcome to Gotham.

303
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,342
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

304
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:25,794
I am smart, captain. Very smart.

305
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,590
Unfortunately,
having the greatest intellect on Earth

306
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:30,993
doesn't always help one
do the impossible.

307
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:33,692
You better be able to pinpoint
that son of a bitch.

308
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:36,599
Aquaman's doomsday device
should be easy for me to find,

309
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,832
simply by locating the power source.

310
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,375
A weapon capable
of wiping out continents

311
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:43,979
would require an astonishing
amount of energy.

312
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,978
Based on my analysis
of the shockwave,

313
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:48,777
our course should take us
right over the origin point.

314
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,352
And there's nothing. Not a blip.

315
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,011
I'm taking a big risk
coming this close to his waters.

316
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,318
- How close are we?
- See for yourself.

317
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,731
That's a lot of death.

318
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,093
Even for me.

319
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,471
I suggest if you want to prevent further
tragedies of this magnitude...

320
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:38,862
Battle stations!

321
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,266
A bit too late for that, I think.

322
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,013
Surface-dwellers, my lord.
Not Amazons.

323
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,386
Meddlers, Orm. They're in my way.

324
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,689
Well, at least I know I was right.

325
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,332
No survivors.

326
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,143
This is crazy. You ought to be in Arkham.

327
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,805
Maybe so, but I need to recreate
the conditions of the accident

328
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,473
that turned me into the Flash.
Strap me in.

329
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:20,090
You know, they say that lightning
doesn't strike the same place twice.

330
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,230
"They say" a lot of things.

331
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,491
Now why don't we pull the switch
and find out?

332
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,305
Come on.

333
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:54,295
Come on, I'm here.

334
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,795
I'm right here!

335
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,119
Oh, my God.

336
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,940
<i>I wish you had better news for me, Cyborg.</i>

337
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,573
<i>This cloud of war grows ever darker,
and I fear we've run out of options.</i>

338
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,848
l just need a little more time,
Mr. President.

339
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:58,256
<i>Victor, there is no more time.
Lex Luthor is dead.</i>

340
00:31:58,415 --> 00:31:59,759
<i>His mission failed.</i>

341
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:03,330
<i>But at least we know the estimated
location of Aquaman's WMD.</i>

342
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,366
Sir, let my team take
out the Atlantean device.

343
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:11,029
<i>Cyborg, you did your best recruiting
meta-humans to help us end this conﬂict,</i>

344
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:15,439
<i>but our top analysts say without
the Batman, you have no team.</i>

345
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,875
<i>It's time to send in
the real heroes, son.</i>

346
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,344
The military?

347
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:22,883
The Atlantean tech will see them coming
from half a world away.

348
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,713
<i>Let our boys worry about that.</i>

349
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,755
<i>Thank you for everything
you've done for this country, Victor.</i>

350
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:31,621
<i>But as of now, you're relieved of duty.</i>

351
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:30,177
<i>War, war, war!</i>

352
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,954
No…

353
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,400
No!

354
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:47,246
Lie down.
You have third-degree burns.

355
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,610
You're lucky to be alive.

356
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:56,358
Somehow I remember things
from this timeline.

357
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,400
How Aquaman destroyed
most of Europe.

358
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:01,695
Maybe that lightning jagged
your memory.

359
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:04,304
But I can remember my world as well.

360
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:08,000
A world where Aquaman would die
before harming innocent people.

361
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,911
My memories are changing, realigning
with this new history Thawne's created.

362
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,949
Soon I'll forget my timeline
and everyone in it.

363
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,918
My wife, your son.

364
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,717
- We're getting that world back.
- Huh. How?

365
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,889
We try again.

366
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:33,128
Try again.

367
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,793
But, sire, the device is too dangerous.

368
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,429
Our attack on New Themyscira
destroyed an entire continent,

369
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,373
but still left the Amazon's
new homeland untouched.

370
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:48,608
More unholy magic from those witches.
Next time we will level their island.

371
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,384
Please, my Emperor.

372
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,717
We tried to use only a fraction
of the power,

373
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,722
and now it is even less stable.

374
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,260
I fear we could sweep clean the ocean floor
as well as the surface world.

375
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:02,619
I see.

376
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,960
Then we will take the witches' island
by force.

377
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:07,500
Inch by bloody inch, if necessary.

378
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,297
They will pay
for what they did to Queen Mera.

379
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,371
I told you never to speak her name.

380
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,240
Yes, my liege.

381
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,746
Prepare the armadas
for surface invasion.

382
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,579
The Amazons' judgment is at hand.

383
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:39,797
Because of you, I'll be responsible
for the deaths of millions.

384
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,331
The odds against recreating exact
variables in the original accident are...

385
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,947
Then just try to douse the flames
a little faster this time, okay?

386
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:54,938
Told you I was fast.

387
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,746
This is Lois Lane of <i> The Daily Planet</i>.

388
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:06,980
My battery is about to die
and l will likely be joining it soon.

389
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:26,132
Earlier today the Amazons captured
some of Aquaman's advance scouts.

390
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,905
Wonder Woman's lasso made them
spill their guts, literally.

391
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:51,822
Aquaman is leading his army through
the English Channel tomorrow.

392
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,764
The Amazons are worried
that if he gets his secret weapon

393
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,268
past their shield,
they'll be vulnerable.

394
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,110
They remain defiant in the face of...

395
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,050
If there is an afterlife...

396
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,693
A cushy anchor job
would not be out of line.

397
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:38,369
Amazons, be ready for...

398
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,985
Who are you? What are you?

399
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:54,224
Don't worry, hot legs.
We're on your side.

400
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,893
Yes, fear not, good lady.

401
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,898
Though our appearance
is somewhat frightful, we're...

402
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:01,467
The Resistance, I know.

403
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,163
Grifter, Godiva, Mrs. Hyde,
Canterbury Cricket.

404
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,313
And some kind of demon from hell?

405
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:18,181
To my share of chaos I make my claim
and Etrigan is my name.

406
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,117
Oh, great, he rhymes.
That's not going to get old fast.

407
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:24,815
Heh, Lois Lane's famous mouth.

408
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,552
I can't believe you didn't get
an arrow shot through it.

409
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:31,563
I would have, if it weren't for whichever
one of you can run at super-speed.

410
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,394
So who do I thank?

411
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:37,505
I don't know what you think just happened,
but there ain't no speedster on this team.

412
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,141
Now, let's get out of here
while we still can.

413
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,947
Never seen anything like it.

414
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:52,119
Your burns are healing.
You should be dead.

415
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:54,255
Your bedside manner sucks.

416
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,858
If I didn't have the Speed Force
helping me heal, I'd find another doctor.

417
00:41:58,715 --> 00:41:59,989
I run a casino.

418
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,221
Haven't been a doctor in 20 years.

419
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:06,425
Here. You need a suit,
and I'm not about to loan you one of mine.

420
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,434
What? It's friction-proof, isn't it?

421
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,974
I had to at least make some
last-minute alterations.

422
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,641
Very snazzy.
I suggest you take it for a test run,

423
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:26,083
and make sure you can break
that time barrier.

424
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:27,744
Once we know that...

425
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:36,494
So I'm finally on the other end
of that trick.

426
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,284
Come on, Barry. Faster.

427
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,887
Faster.

428
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:27,938
If you would just slip these
over your shoes, Mr. Jordan.

429
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,778
Sure. Cleaning bill here must be murder.

430
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,476
What's your name?

431
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,318
I'm afraid we don't have time
for introductions, Captain Jordan.

432
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,427
- Pity.
- I was warned about you.

433
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:43,621
But the president wanted the best pilot,
so you're stuck with me.

434
00:43:43,786 --> 00:43:46,333
Why don't you show me
what you've got hidden away here,

435
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:48,460
and I'll show you what
I can do with it?

436
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:52,798
Holy crap…

437
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,840
I was hoping this would shut you up.

438
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:57,740
Crashed in the California Desert
eight years ago.

439
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,813
Our scientists have been
piecing it back together since then.

440
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:06,717
Its handling capabilities are,
well, beyond anything that we have.

441
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:10,085
May be a little tricky to get the hang of.

442
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:14,592
Ooh, and who's this handsome devil?

443
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,253
- Pilot.
- Died on impact?

444
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,297
Kicked off just as my men found him.

445
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:20,525
Report said he muttered
something in English:

446
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,465
"Beware my power."

447
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:26,733
Then a glowing ring floated off his finger
and shot into space.

448
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:28,706
His ring flew away?

449
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:31,311
You're about to fly
a dead alien's spaceship,

450
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:33,971
and that's the part
you have trouble believing?

451
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:35,338
Tauché.

452
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:39,342
You understand, Jordan,
this mission is no cake walk. In fact...

453
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,717
In fact, in all likelihood,
it's a one-way trip.

454
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:45,724
And if I'm afraid, if I want to back out,
no hard feelings, something like that?

455
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:47,521
Something like that.

456
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:50,597
General Lane, all my life,
I felt like something

457
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:53,030
really special was waiting for me.

458
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,032
Something nobody else
on earth could do.

459
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,697
I think l just found it.
So the last thing I am is afraid.

460
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:05,311
This thing is unbelievably slow,
just like me.

461
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,346
You move pretty fast to my eyes.

462
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:10,916
Not fast enough to break the time barrier,
which I need to do.

463
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:15,217
The only thing I can figure is that another
speedster is co-opting the Speed Force,

464
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:18,155
keeping me from accessing
enough energy to time-travel.

465
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:23,161
But there is no other speedster.
Not in the real world. My world.

466
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,923
So it has to be Zoom.

467
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:27,193
He's the only one
who could’ve done this.

468
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:30,132
He's deliberately preventing me
from changing things back.

469
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:31,795
Then nothing can be done.

470
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:35,670
Even if we knew the trigger point, there's
no one to go back in time and fix it.

471
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,778
Superman could.

472
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:42,315
I already told you, there's no meta-human
that fits that description in this reality.

473
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:43,952
I'm not so sure.

474
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:48,614
In my new memories of this timeline,
I saw something.

475
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:52,248
- A meteor. It hit a city.
- Metropolis.

476
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,615
Thirty years ago.

477
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,097
The same day Superman's rocket
crashed in my reality.

478
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,431
So this never happened in your world?

479
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,007
- It must be a paradise.
- It's not.

480
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:09,472
But at least there was hope.

481
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:12,112
What makes you think
your space baby survived?

482
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:13,469
He's a tough cookie.

483
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,143
- Where's your contact?
- Don't worry. He's always on time.

484
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,449
I have to admit, I didn't expect your call.

485
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,813
Cyborg?

486
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,030
- Vic? You look different.
- Have we met?

487
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,896
No, he's new. Super-speed.
Goes by the Flash.

488
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:36,333
You still need a strategist
for your little army?

489
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,028
Someone to put together a team

490
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,333
to shut down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman?

491
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:43,376
- I... Yes.
- I'll do it.

492
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:47,414
But my way, and I pick the team.
Starting with the Flash.

493
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,744
Then we want to find the alien
who crash-landed here in Metropolis.

494
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:52,818
Alien? What are you talking about?

495
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,175
The meteor.

496
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,018
It's not what your pals
at the Pentagon said it was.

497
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:02,356
Classified information.
We need it and you can get it.

498
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,373
Why aren't you telling him
about me and the timeline?

499
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:15,442
- I'm not lying.
- You're misleading him.

500
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,943
He has a right to know
what our real plan is.

501
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,809
Don't preach to me.
I got enough misplaced morality

502
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,884
to handle with the big metal
Boy Scout on our hands.

503
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,385
He wants to stop the war.
So do we.

504
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,851
That's all he needs to know.

505
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:31,791
There's something there,
but it's above even my clearance.

506
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:36,253
I don't hack into government systems,
Batman.

507
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,728
You do now.

508
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:40,231
If you want me
on your little suicide squad.

509
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:10,731
I'm cycling the motion sensors
and security cameras,

510
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,889
but the loop won't go unnoticed
for long.

511
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,762
Early morning skeleton crew.

512
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,030
Well, do your thing.

513
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,652
I'm trusting
that this is <i>absolutely</i> necessary.

514
00:48:37,813 --> 00:48:40,260
That's why we're here.

515
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,396
Listen, I don't know
what changed your mind or why,

516
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:47,364
but with you on board,
we can save the world from this war.

517
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:48,730
Thank you.

518
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:50,802
Focus on the mission at hand, Stone.

519
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,052
Sir, are you okay?

520
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,467
Is that Clark?

521
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,865
This is the most powerful being
on the planet?

522
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:00,235
Help me.

523
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:04,242
Whoa, easy there, friend.
Everything's going to be fine now.

524
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,610
- Friend?
- That's right.

525
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,378
Cyborg here is your friend.
I'm your friend too.

526
00:50:19,682 --> 00:50:21,356
This must be some kind of mistake.

527
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,590
- A rogue division of the government…
- Keep telling yourself that.

528
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,599
We should have left him where he was.
He'd be safer.

529
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:29,704
He needs the sun.

530
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,239
Don't know if you can understand me,
but what happened to you was wrong.

531
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:35,740
- Most humans aren't like them.
- They're worse.

532
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:37,673
No. People are good.

533
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:40,780
In fact, some of them risk their lives
for the greater good.

534
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:43,815
- They're called heroes.
- Heroes?

535
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,045
Don't worry, friend.
Everything is going to be okay.

536
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,780
I thought heroes never lied.

537
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:59,527
Cyborg, stand down!
You have exceeded your authority.

538
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:03,000
Return the stolen government property
or face immediate fire.

539
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:06,630
You don't understand.
They were using this man as a lab rat.

540
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,639
I don't think they care, Vic.

541
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,778
So beautiful.

542
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:17,442
I have orders from the president
of the United States.

543
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,577
- Maybe I can end this peacefully.
- Yeah, maybe.

544
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,619
No!

545
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,494
Friends.

546
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,985
Superman, close your eyes!

547
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,726
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a seizure.

548
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,123
Memories collapsing in on each other.
We gotta get him out of here.

549
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:11,425
Fight it, Allen. Don't forget my son.

550
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,760
Hell, yeah!

551
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,771
<i>Highball, this is Papa Bear.</i>

552
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:22,248
<i>- Cut the chatter.</i>
- Oh, did I say that out loud?

553
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:23,565
I didn't know.

554
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,554
<i>You're only 1000 miles from drop zone.</i>

555
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:27,775
<i>- Commence radio silence.</i>
- Happily.

556
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,438
<i>One last thing, Jordan.
On behalf of all humanity…</i>

557
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,163
Oh, shut your hole already.
You're ruining this for me.

558
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,724
There you are, baby.
Hold still for Highball.

559
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,759
"Beware my power", asshole.

560
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,454
Continue invasion preparations.

561
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,159
- Who the hell is this?
- He's with us.

562
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,028
Now shut up. What's the story?

563
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,297
Some kind of failed kamikaze attack
on Aquaman's weapon.

564
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,375
- The pilot was Hal Jordan.
- Hal's dead?

565
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,737
That's not all.

566
00:54:29,898 --> 00:54:32,708
The president sent a coalition fleet
to New Themyscira.

567
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,576
The Amazons decimated it.

568
00:54:34,737 --> 00:54:36,809
Troops are being ordered
to Washington D.C.,

569
00:54:36,972 --> 00:54:39,385
to protect the President
and members of Congress.

570
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:42,920
Yeah, as our fearless leaders
make a mad dash for the bunkers.

571
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,278
What does it mean?

572
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,557
It means the final battle between Atlantis
and the Amazons has begun.

573
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,824
But we haven't even started yet.

574
00:54:51,987 --> 00:54:53,523
There's nothing we can do now.

575
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,295
Enjoy the things you love
with the time we have left.

576
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,802
There's bound to be looting
in Gotham by now.

577
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:00,972
I don't want to miss that.

578
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,634
You're just gonna give up
and wait for the inevitable?

579
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,643
Is that what your heroes do here?

580
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,146
Look, you guys may not know me.

581
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,911
But all of us have powers,
skills and abilities.

582
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:14,715
Where I come from,
heroes use those powers

583
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,849
to fight to make the world a better
place, whether it's their world or not.

584
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:22,427
But Superman...
You said he was our last, best hope.

585
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,724
We're alive, Vic.
And where there's life, there's hope.

586
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,088
We'll go to London,

587
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,036
fight both sides
and save the world in the process.

588
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:34,204
Okay. Then we go. Now.

589
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:37,208
I'll signal the others.
Maybe they can meet us there.

590
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,512
Bruce would have come.

591
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:42,905
What the hell. Let's do this.

592
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:45,452
Is the Batplane big enough
for all of us?

593
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,849
The what?

594
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,722
Bruce's Batplane was a little more stoic.

595
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:59,092
Your Batman
didn't have to ferry high rollers

596
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,461
with deep pockets
in and out of his casino.

597
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:04,400
So he wouldn't need
a fully stocked bar aboard.

598
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,268
Everything is top shelf.
Help yourself.

599
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:09,534
I don't drink.

600
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,077
Shocking.

601
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,737
I'm glad I could persuade you
to come along.

602
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:16,103
You didn't.

603
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,585
Ever since I told Cyborg I'd help, I've been
scanning for intel coming out of Europe.

604
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,746
During your little Braveheart speech,

605
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:26,382
l heard an intercepted message
you may find interesting.

606
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:27,789
What?

607
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,041
Lois Lane was an embedded
reporter turned resistance fighter.

608
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,123
She saw something in New Themyscira.

609
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,929
A super being who could move
in the blink of an eye.

610
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,291
Thawne.

611
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,603
If it was him, why let Lane live,
much less help her?

612
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:44,074
- And if he's as fast as you...
- Why let himself be seen?

613
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:46,235
Incoming!

614
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,422
Sire, the aircraft has
been intercepted and nullified.

615
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,688
Would that all our shots be so lucky.

616
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:05,695
We have more than luck, Orm.

617
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,923
Death to the under-dwellers! Unh.

618
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,422
Kill them. Kill them all.

619
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,403
Behold man's final mad disgrace.

620
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:32,177
He chops his nose to spite his face.

621
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,525
You've got to put an end to this.

622
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,530
You're going to destroy the only world
we've got.

623
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:49,431
You won't have it much longer,
surface-dweller.

624
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,481
Plan B. Take down
as many on both sides as you can.

625
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,141
Maybe we can kill enough of them
to call off this war.

626
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,978
Fight your way to the leaders.

627
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:39,847
Once we have Aquaman
and Wonder Woman, this war is over.

628
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:13,818
You murdered my wife, Diana.

629
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:17,356
She tried to assassinate me, Arthur.
I was protecting myself.

630
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:19,686
Yet you wear her helmet like a trophy.

631
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,226
No. A warning.

632
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:34,572
I can't believe I ever loved you.

633
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,005
You never did.

634
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,871
Now!

635
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,760
Shazam!

636
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,867
Captain Thunder.

637
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:06,268
I'm happy to see that a real man is here
to watch the end of man's world.

638
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,405
Fall, damn it, fall!

639
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,313
Sweet.

640
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:39,858
I like your style, Batman.

641
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:44,067
A pity we never teamed up
when the world still existed.

642
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:46,764
Batman and Grifter, the boy idiot.

643
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,773
Take your team up the right flank and...

644
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,860
Don't worry, Batman.
I'll stop the blood flow.

645
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,621
You'll be as good as new.

646
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:11,231
Don't be stupid, Allen.

647
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:16,565
I may not be a very good doctor, but
even I know a dead man when I see one.

648
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,143
- They're gonna die.
- We're dead already.

649
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,713
Find the speedster.

650
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,349
Flush him out.

651
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,077
Change all this.

652
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:33,442
No.

653
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,422
I won't stand by while people are...

654
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:44,652
Hello, Barry.

655
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:46,391
Thawne.

656
01:03:47,856 --> 01:03:51,327
- I love what you've done with the place.
- This is all your fault.

657
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,956
This has worked out so well.

658
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:16,324
That's why I let Lois Lane see me,
you know.

659
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,965
I knew it would bring you.

660
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:25,231
Not that you wouldn't have ended up here
anyway, you hero, you.

661
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,438
What did you do to the world?

662
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,273
Oh, Barry.

663
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,677
That's the beauty of all this.

664
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,840
I didn't do any of it.

665
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,815
You did.

666
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:53,188
Think, Barry.

667
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:57,195
Isn't there some little thing, some little
good deed you might have done?

668
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:02,228
- I saved someone.
- Yes.

669
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:07,530
I saved her. I saved Mom.

670
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:12,811
- That's right.
- No. No.

671
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,744
It wouldn't have changed all this.

672
01:06:14,903 --> 01:06:17,543
It wouldn't have changed
what happened before her murder.

673
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:19,686
Bruce's parents, Clark's landing.

674
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:22,880
Oh, but it did.

675
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,155
Break the sound barrier
and there's a sonic beam.

676
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,990
You broke the time barrier, Flash.
Time beam.

677
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,623
Ripples of distortion radiated out
through that point of impact,

678
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,532
shifting everything just a tiny bit.

679
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:37,893
But enough.

680
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,201
Enough for events to happen
slightly differently.

681
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,769
I just wanted to save her.

682
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:50,179
Her hero. How noble. Oh, wait.

683
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,548
You didn't stop JFK
from getting assassinated,

684
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,213
or made sure Hitler stayed
in Art School.

685
01:06:56,378 --> 01:07:00,418
You saved your mommy.
You missed her.

686
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:05,692
And in a supreme act of selfishness,
shattered history like a rank amateur,

687
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,701
turned the world into a living hell
moments away from destruction.

688
01:07:09,858 --> 01:07:11,463
And I'm the villain?

689
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:16,224
No!

690
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,961
This form is not your own.

691
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,828
How is the enchantment broken?

692
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,993
With a word.

693
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,900
Speak the word.

694
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:56,898
Shazam!

695
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,395
The era of the land-dweller
is at an end, hero.

696
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:29,032
Your metal skull
will decorate my great hall.

697
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:44,056
Hero.

698
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,194
Friend.

699
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:22,951
Submit.

700
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:26,390
You are beaten.

701
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,756
Surrender?

702
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,171
Then what?

703
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,671
You'll let the men of Atlantis
live as your slaves?

704
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,030
The men? No.

705
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:39,908
You are a pestilence the mother Gaia
has suffered for too long.

706
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:45,677
- But perhaps Atlantis' daughters...
- There will be no glorious victor, Diana.

707
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:47,042
No prize.

708
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:52,655
What I do now,
I do for the good of all.

709
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:55,085
As do I.

710
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:22,489
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of here, before he...

711
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:29,328
It's too late.

712
01:11:40,662 --> 01:11:42,233
Good job, Barry.

713
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:46,106
The world is about to end, thanks to you.

714
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:48,715
I hope your mother has a good view of it.

715
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,976
You can't let this happen, Thawne.
You'll die too.

716
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,055
- As you say in this era, totally worth it.
- Unh.

717
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:04,456
As long as I can siphon off the Speed
Force, you can't escape this timeline.

718
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:07,301
I'm afraid there just isn't enough
Speed Force to go around.

719
01:12:16,364 --> 01:12:17,900
There is now.

720
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:19,768
You killed him.

721
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,405
Not necessarily.

722
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,614
Not if you go back in time and fix this.

723
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:41,127
The only way to save the world
is to keep this world from ever happening.

724
01:12:41,289 --> 01:12:43,360
Take this.

725
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:46,502
Run.

726
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:55,699
Barry!

727
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,605
Stop, you'll kill everyone!

728
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:16,625
Barry! Stop! You have to stop!

729
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,560
What the hell?

730
01:14:19,387 --> 01:14:20,587
Get away.

731
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,520
Mom, I'm so sorry.

732
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,399
- Barry.
- Ah!

733
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,675
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

734
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,873
Gotta run, James.

735
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:15,085
You don't finish the files by Friday,
you'll be stuck here all weekend.

736
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:18,488
Well, it's not the end of the world.

737
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,956
I think I finally got it, Mom.

738
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,603
The things you were trying to teach me.

739
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:33,069
- Barry?
- Iris?

740
01:15:42,904 --> 01:15:46,351
Well, heh, that's my kind of hello.

741
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:50,787
- Is everything all right?
- It is now, honey.

742
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,220
It is now.

743
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:58,323
Just to review,
you brake the <i>chronal</i> barrier,

744
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,161
went back in time,
prevented your mother's murder

745
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,564
and completely changed
the time stream.

746
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,399
Nearly destroying
the entire world along the way.

747
01:16:06,561 --> 01:16:07,869
Yes.

748
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:10,135
There's still something
I don't understand.

749
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:11,801
I remember all of it.

750
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:16,439
Not just what happened after
I wake up there, but my whole other life.

751
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:19,551
I remember every birthday cake
my mother ever baked me.

752
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,279
My room, everything.

753
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,516
Perhaps some kind of temporal
after-effect?

754
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:29,728
Or perhaps it was a gift.

755
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:36,659
Yes. A gift.

756
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,666
This is my father's handwriting.

757
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,493
You're one hell of a messenger.

758
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,396
Thank you.
