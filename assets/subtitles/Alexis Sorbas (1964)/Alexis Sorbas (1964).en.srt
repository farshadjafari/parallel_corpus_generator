1
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,942
Be careful.

2
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:49,682
Crete.

3
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,015
Excuse me.

4
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:59,765
He says, "Big storm. Ship must wait."

5
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:03,483
- How long?
- I don't know.

6
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:52,627
You're traveling.

7
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,502
Where to, with your permission?

8
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:58,376
Crete.

9
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,087
And you stay there long, no?

10
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,631
How do you know?

11
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:08,134
I watch you with all the boxes
in the rain. Very funny.

12
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:13,139
I like you.

13
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:17,603
Take me with you. Will you?

14
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,560
Take..?

15
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,853
- Why?
- Why?

16
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:27,987
Will no man ever do something without
a "why?" Just like that. For the hell of it.

17
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:32,204
All right, take me as a cook.
I make soups like...

18
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,199
You like soups, no?

19
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,031
- Well...
- Of course you do. You're English, no?

20
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,332
- Half.
- Half?

21
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:42,588
My father was Greek,
but I was born in England.

22
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,417
Same thing.

23
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,502
With your permission.

24
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:53,761
Hey...

25
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,601
"Virginia."

26
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:06,648
- No. No, thank you.
- Please.

27
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,442
Keep the packet.

28
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,194
Only one.

29
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,968
Are you a cook?

30
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,380
If you need one, I am.

31
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:44,011
What I meant was,
what work do you do?

32
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:48,682
Listen to him. I got hands,
feet, head. They do the jobs.

33
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,896
Who the hell am I to choose?

34
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,394
Well then, what was the most recent?

35
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:59,194
In a mine. I am a good miner.
I have a clever nose for the metals.

36
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,701
But I beat up the boss,
and they kicked me out.

37
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm getting awfully nervous
about the boat. I think I'll...

38
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,543
If you like, I go ask.

39
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:21,290
No, thank you. It's... It's all right.

40
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,434
Well, maybe we could go together
and then you could ask for me.

41
00:06:31,605 --> 00:06:36,016
- Sure. Give me.
- No. Thank you, I can manage.

42
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:51,654
He says 10:00.

43
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,701
Well, that's three whole hours. Damn.

44
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,877
- Are you in big hurry?
- No.

45
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:00,500
Then it's all right. Come.

46
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,052
<i>Roumi.</i> That's "rum."

47
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:14,261
- I'll have some tea, if you don't mind.
- Tea?

48
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,901
And you, mister, what do you do?

49
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,519
Me? Well, I'm a writer.

50
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,490
Excuse me, but you look it.

51
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,569
What do you write? Love stories?

52
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:36,906
No. Poetry. Essays.

53
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,449
What's that?

54
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,540
Essays.

55
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,168
No. You think too much.
That is your trouble.

56
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,459
Clever people and grocers,
they weigh everything.

57
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:54,002
Me? If I was you, I would look
at me straight and I would say:

58
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:57,096
"Zorba, come." Or, "Zorba, don't come."

59
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:58,682
Zorba?

60
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,550
That's me: Alexis Zorba.

61
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:07,639
- I have other names, if you are interested.
- Oh, I am.

62
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:10,184
"Spaghetti," because I am long.

63
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,278
And "California,"
because I have been to America.

64
00:08:13,822 --> 00:08:17,569
And "Epidemic," because every place
I go, people say I louse things up.

65
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:19,651
Your health.

66
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,634
Listen to that bitch, the sea.

67
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,974
That maker of widows.

68
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,730
What have you got in there?

69
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,434
Clothes?

70
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,653
You ask such sensible questions.

71
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,365
- It's my <i>santouri.</i>
- Your what?

72
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,192
My <i>santouri.</i>

73
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,533
Makes the best music.

74
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:12,450
It goes with me always.

75
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:20,245
And you, what are you go to
do in Crete? With your permission.

76
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,048
I have some land there.
It belonged to my father.

77
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:26,543
And you go to write?

78
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:29,513
Not exactly.

79
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:31,966
What, exactly?

80
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:35,144
I haven't written anything in months.

81
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:44,600
On this land, there's an old mine.

82
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:48,315
- Lignite.
<i>- Lignitis</i>! I know!

83
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:51,113
It's been idle for years.

84
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,528
Why?

85
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,120
Because I let it.

86
00:09:56,998 --> 00:10:00,830
And now you want to make it work.

87
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,205
If I can.

88
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,082
Yes.

89
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:09,378
I must.

90
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:35,232
Which way is it going?

91
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:39,447
- What?
- The weighing machine.

92
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,740
Zorba up, or Zorba down?

93
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,577
Well. I was thinking...

94
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,168
That mine...

95
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:54,249
I'm not very rich, and I will need
someone with experience.

96
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,790
- So I...
- And so?

97
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:00,596
Well, although I...

98
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:03,880
I don't really know you very well...

99
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,644
And what I'm doing is probably mad.

100
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,731
It's yes.

101
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,067
Yes?

102
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:17,695
Yes.

103
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:22,152
Shake.

104
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,912
Mister, you are a lucky man.
When Zorba goes to work...

105
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,370
...no mine stands a chance.

106
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:34,868
Be wonderful to get down
to some real work.

107
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:38,710
Also, it'll be good for the village.
I understand it's rather poor.

108
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,455
We make everybody happy.

109
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,759
And we'll have fun too.

110
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,386
We'll swim. And we'll drink wine.

111
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,181
And you'll play the <i>santouri.</i>

112
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,813
What's the matter?

113
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,309
It's about the <i>santouri.</i>

114
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,735
We make a bargain, or I cannot come.

115
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:08,403
In work, I am your man.

116
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:14,489
But in things like playing
and singing, I am my own.

117
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,081
How do you mean?

118
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,706
I mean free.

119
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:22,663
You...

120
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:24,918
...you sign?

121
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:28,793
I sign.

122
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:35,837
- Here.
- But I don't drink rum.

123
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:39,801
This time you will.
Why start with the wrong foot?

124
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:42,768
Well, Zorba, God bless.

125
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,639
And the devil too, boss!

126
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:00,506
You like her, boss?

127
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,086
No.

128
00:14:49,427 --> 00:14:50,923
Are you all right?

129
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:52,424
Sure.

130
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:55,845
Here.

131
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:00,010
Thanks, boss.

132
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,770
Your friend in there
will be looking for you.

133
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:13,610
Incidentally, you never told me.
Are you married?

134
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:19,326
Am I not a man?
And is not a man stupid?

135
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:24,081
I'm a man. So I married.

136
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:29,162
Wife, children, house. Everything.

137
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,875
The full catastrophe.

138
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,336
What happened?

139
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,719
Be a pal, boss.

140
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:41,383
Don't make me talk.

141
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,726
And you?

142
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,263
No, I'm single.

143
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:51,347
I guess too many books.

144
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,524
Look! Look! A dolphin.

145
00:15:58,198 --> 00:15:59,312
Why, yes.

146
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:05,075
What kind of a man are you?
Don't you even like dolphins?

147
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:41,746
- I hope we find somewhere to stay.
- Sure.

148
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,407
Have you never heard
of Cretan hospitality?

149
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:22,366
Now, Mr. Epidemic, you behave yourself.
We don't want to start another war.

150
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:27,079
Boss, if there is a widow around,
don't worry.

151
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:56,356
- What are they all saying?
- They all want us to stay with them.

152
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,034
Madame Hortense.

153
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,529
Who is that?

154
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:10,075
- Who's Madame Hortense?
- A French woman.

155
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:12,412
She has hotel.

156
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,834
I am Mavrandoni.

157
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,250
So you come at last. I welcome you.

158
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,255
- I'm glad to meet you. You got my letter?
- Yes.

159
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:24,292
Mr. Mavrandoni has been
looking after our land.

160
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,423
This Madame. She's a widow?

161
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:31,003
How many hairs on my head?

162
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:35,180
She's a widow of the same number
of husbands.

163
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,140
<i>Bonjour.</i>

164
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,271
<i>Bonjour.</i>

165
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,309
Welcome, gentlemen.

166
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:36,279
This is a great pleasure, Madame.

167
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:46,155
Two beds, Madame.

168
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:48,415
Without bugs.

169
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:53,040
Monsieur, Madame Hortense
has not the bugs.

170
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,424
You have to admit, boss. It is big.

171
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:01,836
But she shakes it well.

172
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:07,392
This way.

173
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:51,136
They say it was my grand success.

174
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:57,137
You may not believe it, monsieur,
but I was a very famous artiste.

175
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,770
I appear in all the most chic cabarets.

176
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:10,031
I slept in the silk sheets with real lace.

177
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:13,944
- Boss, ask her to dance.
- What?

178
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:17,165
- Make a pass. Pinch her.
- No.

179
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,205
It's only polite.

180
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,334
What?

181
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:24,287
He would like to dance with you.

182
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:27,334
But he is shy.

183
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:30,210
Perhaps Madame is tired.

184
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:32,051
She is not.

185
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:33,761
Are you?

186
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,469
Come on.

187
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:48,869
These Cretans. They are so ungrateful.

188
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:52,201
Don't cry, my little <i>chouchou.</i>

189
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:57,416
They would be dead, all dead,
if there was not me.

190
00:23:57,588 --> 00:23:59,132
I know, I know.

191
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,586
- No hands.
- Madame.

192
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:05,882
Hey.

193
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,894
Boss. Match?

194
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:24,108
Madame.

195
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:35,413
You know how I came to Crete?

196
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:40,701
With the British fleet. Yes, monsieur.

197
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:44,330
I was in love with the admiral...

198
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:47,672
...and where he go, I go.

199
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:51,505
It was here that I met the other three.

200
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:53,798
What other three?

201
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,631
Admirals, of course.

202
00:24:57,351 --> 00:25:02,178
The French, the Italian
and the Russian.

203
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,276
How lovely they was,
my four admirals...

204
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:11,690
...with their golden epaulets
and all those feathers.

205
00:25:11,864 --> 00:25:14,780
Like big, beautiful cockerels!

206
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:20,575
And what beards.
So soft, and curly and perfumed.

207
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:25,953
Fortunately, each has different
perfume, so it was no mistake...

208
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,535
...even in the dark.

209
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:37,675
My little <i>chouchou.</i> Here, here.

210
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:44,642
- My darling queen, please continue.
- Yes.

211
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:52,066
Me and my admirals...

212
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,440
...we sit on the deck...

213
00:25:54,611 --> 00:25:57,646
...dressed very informal...

214
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:01,699
...and we discussion politics.

215
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:04,240
Very serious.

216
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:12,282
All the time they pour champagne
over me to make me fresh.

217
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:16,203
It was summer, you know, very hot.

218
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:20,505
And in this time, in Crete...

219
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:23,676
...it was big trouble.

220
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:26,549
Revolution or something.

221
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:33,018
With my binoculars I could see
the poor little Cretans...

222
00:26:33,188 --> 00:26:37,136
...running in mountains
with their flags.

223
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:38,976
My four admirals...

224
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:42,362
...they want to open the fire.

225
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,778
But I throw myself in the middle.

226
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:48,521
I pull the Italian by the beard...

227
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:51,073
You know, I was
more familiar with him.

228
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,072
And I cry:

229
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:57,326
"Stop it, you can't kill them!

230
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,042
Please, Canavaro, Canavaro <i>mio,</i>
no boom-boom!"

231
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:05,380
Canavaro? What the hell is that?

232
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:07,875
What you think it is?

233
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:11,799
Himself. Canavaro.

234
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:14,593
Canavaro <i>mio.</i>

235
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,925
Go on, my <i>chouchou.</i>

236
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:23,096
Again and again I stopped
the boom-boom.

237
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:25,979
- And what do you think I get in the end?
- What?

238
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:28,441
What? Tell me.

239
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:30,521
Tell me what.

240
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,987
Nothing! No medals!

241
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,907
- Nothing!
- Please, no more boom-boom.

242
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:48,584
- You are laughing.
- No.

243
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:54,008
- At me.
- No, of course not.

244
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:56,835
Don't... Don't go.

245
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:07,310
That was a very bad thing
we did, boss.

246
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:11,224
A poor, weak creature.

247
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,154
Where are you? Bouboulina?

248
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:21,233
Where are you?

249
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,951
My Bouboulina.

250
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,335
Bouboulina.

251
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,997
Go away.

252
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:48,097
It's me, your Canavaro.

253
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,807
Fine Canavaro you are.

254
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,477
No feathers.

255
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:57,104
No beard.

256
00:28:57,817 --> 00:29:02,644
Here. Blow, my Bouboulina.

257
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,951
What's that, "Bouboulina"?

258
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,076
She was a big hero in the war
against the Turks. Huh, boss?

259
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:17,748
Yes, Madame. She was like you.

260
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,827
A great sea dog.

261
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:21,664
You see?

262
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:24,714
Yes.

263
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:29,130
Me too. I fought breasts to breasts.

264
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:34,255
But then came the bad times.

265
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,722
They make the peace...

266
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:41,557
...and the ship must go away.

267
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:45,352
"And me...

268
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:49,310
...what will become of me?" I cry.

269
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:53,655
Four times a widow.

270
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,531
They laughed, monsieur.

271
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:02,907
You men are so cruel.

272
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:09,247
In the end, they was sorry for me,
so they undress me...

273
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:12,424
...they fill the bath with champagne...

274
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:16,637
...and they drop me.

275
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:20,423
Then they sit all around.

276
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:24,729
You understand that now that
we was all very familiar.

277
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,476
And they drank all the champagne.

278
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:34,897
AII, from the top to the bottom.

279
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:41,482
Then...

280
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:46,903
And then they put out the light.

281
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,991
When I waked up...

282
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:54,333
...I smelled so good.

283
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:58,342
All their perfume...

284
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:01,260
...one on top of the other.

285
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:08,259
But they was gone.

286
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:13,230
Men are so cruel.

287
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:18,148
Canavaro.

288
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,311
Hello?

289
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:25,075
Canavaro.

290
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:33,991
What is it?

291
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,199
Look.

292
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:17,931
Boss, a big, beautiful, wild widow.

293
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:17,123
Pavlo!

294
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,327
Look at Mavrandoni.

295
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:10,630
He is burning.

296
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:12,797
Why?

297
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:17,599
His son is crazy in love
with the widow.

298
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:21,137
But she spits him in the eye.

299
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,815
The more she spits...

300
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:27,849
...the more he wants her.

301
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:31,320
Look.

302
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,153
Look at the faces of all these.

303
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:38,153
They all want her.

304
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:43,614
And they hate her
because they cannot have her.

305
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:49,206
Only one man here...

306
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:52,255
...can.

307
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,003
Who?

308
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,135
You.

309
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:05,429
Rubbish.

310
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:09,731
I saw her eyes
when she looked at you.

311
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:13,356
- Zorba, don't start.
- Listen.

312
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:19,190
God, who is a clever devil, today put
in your hands a gift from paradise.

313
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:24,358
- Don't be silly.
- Boss. Why did God give us hands?

314
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:27,413
To grab. Well, grab.

315
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:03,440
- Boss.
- Yes.

316
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:05,688
Boss, listen. You go, you knock.

317
00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:09,114
You say,
"I have come for my umbrella."

318
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:11,692
- She will say, "Please, please come in."
- No.

319
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:14,704
Boss. Boss, don't make me mad.

320
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:16,782
I don't want any trouble.

321
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:21,371
Boss. Life is trouble,
only death is not.

322
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:25,673
To be alive is to undo your belt
and look for trouble.

323
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:27,336
Well?

324
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:30,130
No.

325
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,083
Zorba!

326
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,764
What?

327
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:05,197
For God's sake, boss.
Will you go back to your papers?

328
00:43:23,722 --> 00:43:25,181
Zorba?

329
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:44,487
Get out.

330
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:47,865
Get out!

331
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:16,637
Zorba!

332
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:36,152
You bastard mountain!

333
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:38,570
I'll eat your guts!

334
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,382
What is it, Zorba?

335
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:52,166
They left axes inside,
that's what.

336
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:57,420
They are so brave, every time they
hear a noise, they mess their pants!

337
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:02,393
Zorba, leave them alone!

338
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:04,887
- Axes cost money.
- I know, and I don't care!

339
00:45:05,188 --> 00:45:08,639
Right now I'm just glad
that nobody's hurt. That's all.

340
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:13,070
And what's more, I think you should
let them go for today.

341
00:45:15,032 --> 00:45:16,358
Boss.

342
00:45:17,074 --> 00:45:23,576
You better make up your mind. Are you
or are you not a gosh darn capitalist?

343
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:31,295
I'm hungry.

344
00:45:53,398 --> 00:45:55,556
We've got to find some strong trees...

345
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:58,059
...to make beams for the galleries.

346
00:50:25,268 --> 00:50:26,679
Hello.

347
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:55,253
You're late.

348
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:08,472
What is it, Zorba?

349
00:51:16,648 --> 00:51:18,521
Out with it.

350
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:22,813
Boss...

351
00:51:27,282 --> 00:51:28,612
Do you trust me?

352
00:51:30,244 --> 00:51:31,572
Yes, I do.

353
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:33,989
Why the hell do you?

354
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:39,204
- Because you are you.
- But you don't understand.

355
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:41,619
My brain is not the right weight.

356
00:51:41,795 --> 00:51:45,923
It... It gives me such crazy ideas.

357
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:50,211
I might ruin you.

358
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:52,463
I'll take that chance.

359
00:51:57,518 --> 00:51:59,760
Say that again, boss.

360
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:01,724
Give me courage.

361
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,851
I'll take that chance.

362
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,650
Boss.

363
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:17,568
- Boss.
- What?

364
00:52:18,204 --> 00:52:22,498
- Do you dance?
- Dance? No, no.

365
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:27,335
Then get out of the way.
I... I may knock you down.

366
00:54:39,998 --> 00:54:41,742
Zorba!

367
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,826
That's enough!

368
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:49,746
Stop. Stop.

369
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:52,083
Go!

370
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:26,570
Zorba. Zorba!

371
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:28,623
Are you all right?

372
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:33,039
Now...

373
00:55:36,257 --> 00:55:38,166
Now, I can...

374
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:40,751
I can talk again.

375
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:43,170
What on earth came over you?

376
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:48,423
When a man is full...

377
00:55:49,603 --> 00:55:51,760
...what can he do?

378
00:55:52,606 --> 00:55:53,719
Burst?

379
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:02,565
When my little boy, Dimitri, died...

380
00:56:04,826 --> 00:56:07,233
...everybody was crying.

381
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:10,371
Me?

382
00:56:12,248 --> 00:56:14,157
I got up...

383
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:16,875
...and I danced.

384
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:20,670
They said:

385
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:23,456
"Zorba is mad."

386
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:28,751
But it was the dancing...

387
00:56:30,097 --> 00:56:35,007
...only the dancing
that stopped the pain.

388
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:39,141
You see, he was my first.

389
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:46,228
And he was only 3.

390
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,199
When I'm happy...

391
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,952
...it's the same thing.

392
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:11,793
Come inside. You'll catch cold.

393
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,405
With your permission.

394
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:43,788
Now...

395
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:48,530
...will you tell me
what this is all about?

396
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:53,376
- I got a plan.
- What plan?

397
00:57:53,547 --> 00:57:55,505
A great, big, crazy plan.

398
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:57,251
Well, what?

399
00:57:59,427 --> 00:58:01,052
- I cannot tell you.
- Why?

400
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:05,467
I got many things to be figuring:
trees, monks, machines.

401
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:08,139
Tomorrow, maybe.

402
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:10,802
Tonight we celebrate.

403
00:58:14,817 --> 00:58:18,315
Come on! Don't be delicate.

404
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:35,952
- Boss.
- What?

405
00:58:38,045 --> 00:58:39,838
Come and see.

406
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,802
Do you remember that plan
I could not tell you about?

407
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:53,510
- Here it is.
- What is it?

408
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:58,646
It's a mountain. That one.

409
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:00,356
Oh, yes.

410
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:03,817
Look.

411
00:59:05,278 --> 00:59:08,030
That's the way
we'll get the trees down.

412
00:59:08,197 --> 00:59:11,233
An overhead cable? You're mad.

413
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:12,737
Why?

414
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:15,996
Well, to begin with
that forest doesn't belong to us.

415
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:20,742
Well it doesn't, and it does.

416
00:59:20,918 --> 00:59:22,329
What does that mean?

417
00:59:22,503 --> 00:59:26,416
It belongs to the monastery.
The monastery belongs to God.

418
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:30,005
And God belongs to everybody.
You agree?

419
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:32,884
No, I certainly don't.

420
00:59:33,054 --> 00:59:35,295
All right,
you will pay them something...

421
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:37,429
...but not much.
- How do you know?

422
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,759
They are friends of mine.

423
00:59:41,228 --> 00:59:44,643
If it works, we will bring down
the whole forest.

424
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:48,563
First we get the mine going.
Then open a timber factory.

425
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:54,856
We get stinking rich, then make our
own ship and sail around the world.

426
00:59:57,744 --> 01:00:00,530
Aren't you going a little too fast?

427
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:02,905
Do you know how old I am?

428
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:04,989
Never mind, that's a secret.

429
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:08,617
But I have got to go fast.

430
01:00:09,086 --> 01:00:15,588
You know, they... They say that
age kills the fire inside of a man.

431
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:18,210
That he hears death coming.

432
01:00:18,387 --> 01:00:21,969
He opens the door and says,
"Come in. Give me rest."

433
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:25,467
That is a pack of old damn lies!

434
01:00:25,643 --> 01:00:29,059
I've got enough fight in me
to devour the world.

435
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:32,480
So I fight.

436
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:39,523
Well? Do we?

437
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,650
Or do we let the mountain win?

438
01:00:45,286 --> 01:00:46,661
Tell me what you need.

439
01:00:47,538 --> 01:00:51,487
I will need some strong wire,
hooks and... And things.

440
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,659
I will have to go to town.

441
01:00:53,835 --> 01:00:57,251
I still have to figure out the angle.

442
01:00:57,422 --> 01:01:01,833
If it's not perfect,
it will be catastrophe.

443
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,005
How long will it take you?

444
01:01:09,141 --> 01:01:12,510
The way things are going,
it had better be soon or not at all.

445
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:21,273
I'll give you until Christmas.

446
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:26,672
Hey, boss.

447
01:03:31,143 --> 01:03:33,052
Rose water.

448
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:50,490
- Boss?
- Well? What news?

449
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:54,867
I made a great discovery.

450
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:58,909
Stones are alive.

451
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,663
Well, that's fine.

452
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:05,253
Well, I wish instead you'd discover
your famous angle.

453
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,547
I'm trying, boss.

454
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:21,311
- Look, your umbrella.
- Never mind.

455
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:26,942
Just let me remind you
that tomorrow's Christmas.

456
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,195
I know.

457
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:40,905
Wh..? Where are you going?

458
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,159
I need some wire.

459
01:04:57,097 --> 01:04:59,586
Where the hell did I put it?

460
01:05:01,182 --> 01:05:03,306
Won't this string do?

461
01:05:06,228 --> 01:05:08,186
Excuse me.

462
01:05:12,693 --> 01:05:14,402
Look.

463
01:05:14,987 --> 01:05:16,695
A melomakarouna.

464
01:05:16,864 --> 01:05:19,402
- A what?
- A Christmas cookie.

465
01:05:19,574 --> 01:05:22,065
Well, what's so strange about that?

466
01:05:22,911 --> 01:05:24,653
Nothing.

467
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:29,784
But many melomakarouna inside
an empty trunk is very strange.

468
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,206
- An umbrella under a bed is also strange.
- All right, all right.

469
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:39,047
- She came here?
- No. She sent them.

470
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:43,460
Now you have the proof.
Now, it is very simple.

471
01:05:43,762 --> 01:05:48,222
- Tonight, after Bouboulina's party...
- Get on with your work.

472
01:05:52,688 --> 01:05:56,103
Boss, you want me
to beat you an egg?

473
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:58,266
It's good for the strength.

474
01:06:00,445 --> 01:06:03,231
Boss, now I can tell you a secret.

475
01:06:03,405 --> 01:06:06,192
All these days I couldn't work,
I couldn't sleep.

476
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:09,284
And you know why?
Because of the widow.

477
01:06:10,286 --> 01:06:13,619
Don't get me wrong, I know
she's too good for these old bones.

478
01:06:13,789 --> 01:06:16,956
But to think of her without anybody...

479
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:18,833
...that was too much.

480
01:06:19,503 --> 01:06:24,248
All right, laugh, but remember this.

481
01:06:24,425 --> 01:06:29,251
If a woman sleeps alone,
it puts a shame on all men.

482
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:31,422
God has a very big heart...

483
01:06:31,597 --> 01:06:34,967
...but there is one sin
he will not forgive:

484
01:06:35,143 --> 01:06:40,219
If a woman calls a man to her bed
and he will not go.

485
01:06:40,398 --> 01:06:44,692
I know, because a very wise,
old Turk told me.

486
01:06:46,695 --> 01:06:50,822
A Turk? And you,
a Greek, believed him?

487
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:04,329
I'm going to wash.

488
01:07:06,003 --> 01:07:09,206
I thought the Greeks
and the Turks never talked.

489
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:10,918
They just fought.

490
01:07:15,804 --> 01:07:18,376
Don't tell me you never went to war.

491
01:07:18,556 --> 01:07:21,094
I don't like that kind of stupid talk.

492
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:22,596
What's so stupid about...

493
01:07:22,768 --> 01:07:25,722
...fighting for your country?
- Excuse me, boss.

494
01:07:25,896 --> 01:07:30,273
You talk like a teacher.
You think like a teacher.

495
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:32,684
How can you understand?

496
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,900
Of course I can.

497
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:37,230
With your head, yes.

498
01:07:38,157 --> 01:07:40,612
You say, "This is right.

499
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:42,987
This is wrong."

500
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:45,911
But when you talk...

501
01:07:46,206 --> 01:07:47,998
...I watch your arms...

502
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:51,202
...your legs, your chest.

503
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,628
They are dumb.

504
01:07:53,797 --> 01:07:55,422
They say nothing.

505
01:07:55,632 --> 01:07:59,842
- So how can you understand?
- You're just making up excuses.

506
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:03,461
I don't believe you give
a damn about your country.

507
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:06,260
Don't you talk to me like that!

508
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,342
Look, here, and here and here.

509
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,844
Nothing on the back!

510
01:08:15,817 --> 01:08:20,524
I have done things for my country
that would make your hair stand.

511
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:25,157
I have killed, burned villages,
raped women.

512
01:08:25,326 --> 01:08:27,068
And why?

513
01:08:27,243 --> 01:08:30,529
Because they were Turks
or Bulgarians.

514
01:08:30,704 --> 01:08:33,409
That's the rotten damn fool I was.

515
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:41,126
Now I look at a man, any man,
and I say, "He is good. He is bad."

516
01:08:41,298 --> 01:08:43,337
What do I care if he's Greek or Turk?

517
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:49,213
As I get older,
I swear by the bread I eat.

518
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:55,509
I even stop asking that.
Good or bad, what is the difference?

519
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,390
They all end up the same way...

520
01:09:01,442 --> 01:09:04,810
...food for worms.

521
01:09:08,572 --> 01:09:12,521
And as for women,
you make fun of me that I love them.

522
01:09:12,701 --> 01:09:14,739
How can I not love them?

523
01:09:14,911 --> 01:09:17,782
They're such poor, weak creatures.

524
01:09:18,873 --> 01:09:20,782
And it takes so little.

525
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,787
A man's hand on their breast...

526
01:09:24,212 --> 01:09:26,287
...and they give you all they've got.

527
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:39,010
Where are you, Bouboulina?

528
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:42,176
Canavaro is here.

529
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:50,315
<i>Chouchou</i>!

530
01:09:50,694 --> 01:09:53,065
Look what I brought you.

531
01:09:53,237 --> 01:09:55,989
<i>- Merci.</i>
- Happy Christmas!

532
01:09:56,865 --> 01:09:59,024
I made it myself
to make her feel good.

533
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:13,836
- It's me?
- Yes.

534
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:17,671
- Merry Christmas, Madame.
- And also for you.

535
01:10:17,842 --> 01:10:21,841
What is that extraordinary smell
coming from the kitchen?

536
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:25,881
- It is a big fat Turkish.
- A Turkish.

537
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:31,729
- I hope he's not burning.
- Do not worry. Sit down.

538
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:35,479
We will start from the center,
the belly.

539
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:39,101
Then we will take care
of the other parts, later.

540
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:41,689
Yes.

541
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,623
<i>Merci.</i>

542
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,707
Aren't you feeling well?

543
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:12,472
In my age, monsieur,
one is never well.

544
01:11:13,476 --> 01:11:16,264
Especially on the holidays.

545
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:24,225
I drink to your health,
my beautiful <i>chouchou</i> mermaid.

546
01:11:24,403 --> 01:11:27,024
May you grow new teeth...

547
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:29,734
...and new skin...

548
01:11:29,908 --> 01:11:35,114
...and throw away these stupid ribbons
you wear to hide your neck.

549
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:40,908
May the Great Powers
come back to Crete.

550
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:44,536
And when you rise out
of the waves to greet them...

551
01:11:44,712 --> 01:11:47,796
...may all their damn ships crash...

552
01:11:47,966 --> 01:11:53,470
...on these round, hard rocks.

553
01:11:55,972 --> 01:12:00,301
I wish it could happen, what you say.

554
01:12:00,478 --> 01:12:04,261
- But it is too late.
- No, it is not!

555
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:18,784
Please, no!

556
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,960
Are you all right?

557
01:12:38,052 --> 01:12:42,512
You see, it is too late.

558
01:12:52,606 --> 01:12:57,731
Oh, don't be sad, my little Bouboulina.

559
01:12:57,904 --> 01:13:00,395
I have heard of a new doctor in Europe.

560
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:03,527
He makes miracles.

561
01:13:03,952 --> 01:13:07,533
You take what the hell ever
he gives you, drops or powders...

562
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:10,034
...and you become 20 again.

563
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:12,614
Maybe 25.

564
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:15,829
I will get you some.

565
01:13:16,962 --> 01:13:19,336
- You will?
- Sure.

566
01:13:19,715 --> 01:13:25,503
- A big bottle?
- A whole barrel.

567
01:13:26,889 --> 01:13:28,382
Here.

568
01:13:34,145 --> 01:13:36,682
What are you thinking?

569
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:42,479
Alexandria, Beirut, Istanbul.

570
01:13:42,653 --> 01:13:44,645
How they loved me.

571
01:13:44,947 --> 01:13:46,405
Who?

572
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:49,823
Everybody.

573
01:13:50,868 --> 01:13:54,202
Ali Bey, Mustafa Nahas Pasha.

574
01:13:54,454 --> 01:13:59,412
Suleiman Pasha. Especially Suleiman.

575
01:14:08,551 --> 01:14:11,088
Those damn cats.

576
01:14:33,448 --> 01:14:34,859
Well, I...

577
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:37,451
What?

578
01:14:38,703 --> 01:14:41,787
- She's asleep?
- Yes.

579
01:14:43,707 --> 01:14:45,286
Let her.

580
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,248
She's 20 again.

581
01:14:48,755 --> 01:14:53,332
She's strolling
around Alexandria, Beirut.

582
01:14:54,384 --> 01:14:57,255
Look at her, smiling.

583
01:14:58,887 --> 01:15:02,220
Silly old bitch. Come on.

584
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,382
We can't go and just leave her alone.

585
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,100
She's not alone. She is with
Suleiman Pasha, having hell of a time.

586
01:15:10,523 --> 01:15:12,729
Dirty old cow.

587
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:31,240
She is in.

588
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:33,251
Go.

589
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,542
And God bless you.

590
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:45,631
- Where are you going?
- To church.

591
01:15:45,805 --> 01:15:48,344
- I've never been to a Greek Christmas.
- Boss!

592
01:15:48,516 --> 01:15:53,722
- No. Don't you understand?
- You're young, full of energy.

593
01:15:53,895 --> 01:15:56,302
I don't understand
what you're doing with it.

594
01:15:57,483 --> 01:16:00,436
I've had enough of this.
Why don't you leave me alone?

595
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:02,769
I love you,
and I want the best for you.

596
01:16:02,945 --> 01:16:05,104
- Don't shout!
- Who's shouting!

597
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:10,030
There she is. She is waiting.

598
01:16:10,578 --> 01:16:12,570
- Cigarette.
- This is ridiculous.

599
01:16:12,747 --> 01:16:15,582
- I'm not going to stand here arguing.
- But, boss...

600
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:19,746
...she is waiting for you.
- Let's just say that I'm different...

601
01:16:19,918 --> 01:16:22,671
...and I've got to go my own way.

602
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,631
If God went your way,
there would be no Christmas.

603
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,128
He didn't go to church, he went to Mary.
And Christ was born.

604
01:16:30,304 --> 01:16:34,135
He went that way. Mary is the widow.

605
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:50,810
On a deaf man's door,
you can knock forever!

606
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,197
Ever.

607
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,340
- Now, here's the money.
- Thank you.

608
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:02,426
And remember, it's all I can afford.

609
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:06,510
- Poor boss, I know.
- Just buy what we need for the cable...

610
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:08,805
...and come straight back.
- Of course.

611
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:12,972
- Don't get stuck anywhere on the way.
- I will be quick like the wind.

612
01:18:13,145 --> 01:18:17,643
- Five days. You promised.
- Boss, I promise.

613
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,318
Goodbye, boss.

614
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:25,113
Zorba. Zorba!

615
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:29,283
What do you want?

616
01:18:29,453 --> 01:18:31,159
Don't forget me.

617
01:18:31,328 --> 01:18:34,780
Yes. Goodbye.

618
01:18:40,796 --> 01:18:44,545
Don't be sad. He's coming back.

619
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:49,088
They all say that.

620
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:31,152
Garçon! Champagne.

621
01:23:41,443 --> 01:23:45,770
"I shall not describe you...

622
01:23:45,945 --> 01:23:48,981
...the continuation.

623
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:51,529
Except to say...

624
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:57,573
...that it was long and very wild."

625
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:05,500
Very, very wild.

626
01:24:10,927 --> 01:24:13,216
Next afternoon...

627
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:16,922
Next afternoon...

628
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:19,466
...I wake up.

629
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:21,845
And...

630
01:24:23,064 --> 01:24:24,556
...what do I see?

631
01:24:25,606 --> 01:24:28,893
Next to me, in bed...

632
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:36,237
...the female sex...

633
01:24:37,076 --> 01:24:39,114
...in person.

634
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:44,990
Soft...

635
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:49,371
...and warm...

636
01:24:49,546 --> 01:24:53,376
...and sweet-smelling.

637
01:24:54,382 --> 01:24:57,337
So I say to myself:

638
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,378
"Zorba...

639
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:06,176
...you are in paradise.

640
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,104
Enjoy it.

641
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:13,149
Don't move."

642
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:18,646
<i>Imagine what luck.</i>
<i>There's a restaurant opposite...</i>

643
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:24,064
<i>... and they sends us food,</i>
<i>splendiferous food. Caviar...</i>

644
01:25:24,827 --> 01:25:28,409
<i>... steaks, baklava, everything.</i>

645
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:34,666
<i>We eat and back to work,</i>
<i>and back to sleep and so on, et cetera.</i>

646
01:25:36,421 --> 01:25:38,377
Antoni!

647
01:25:39,881 --> 01:25:44,127
<i>This is my good news, boss. And don't</i>
<i>worry, I think of your business also.</i>

648
01:25:44,302 --> 01:25:49,261
<i>But I ask you, why push things?</i>
<i>Every day my head becomes more clear...</i>

649
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,141
<i>... and I shall be able</i>
<i>to make the best deals.</i>

650
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:57,474
<i>I kiss you friendly. Me, Zorba.</i>

651
01:26:12,537 --> 01:26:17,493
<i>P.S., I forgot to tell you.</i>
<i>Her name is Lola.</i>

652
01:26:36,182 --> 01:26:37,926
Monsieur.

653
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:44,805
Pardon. They told me you had a letter.

654
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:48,689
It's from him?

655
01:26:49,112 --> 01:26:51,150
It's from him.

656
01:26:56,826 --> 01:26:58,819
What does he say?

657
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:05,497
Read it yourself.

658
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,680
I cannot.

659
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:27,270
My eyes.

660
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:34,226
He says...

661
01:27:35,485 --> 01:27:37,563
...he's very busy.

662
01:27:41,073 --> 01:27:44,323
There is something for me?

663
01:27:44,536 --> 01:27:46,279
Of course.

664
01:27:47,663 --> 01:27:49,372
Read it.

665
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:52,369
Please.

666
01:27:57,381 --> 01:28:01,627
"Please tell Bouboulina
that I miss her."

667
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:07,805
Go on.

668
01:28:11,644 --> 01:28:13,387
"Tell her...

669
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:17,935
...that every night I go back
to my little room...

670
01:28:18,943 --> 01:28:22,725
...and I pray to God
to send me back to her...

671
01:28:22,987 --> 01:28:24,648
...quickly.

672
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:32,994
For without my Bouboulina...

673
01:28:33,456 --> 01:28:36,574
...I feel so damn miserable...

674
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:40,162
...that when I see her again I...

675
01:28:41,296 --> 01:28:43,038
...I'll..."

676
01:28:45,091 --> 01:28:46,206
What?

677
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,460
"I'll kneel before her...

678
01:28:52,596 --> 01:28:55,088
...and ask her to be mine forever."

679
01:28:59,561 --> 01:29:02,729
Forever?

680
01:29:02,899 --> 01:29:06,895
Yes, forever. That's what he says.

681
01:29:10,947 --> 01:29:12,738
All right.

682
01:29:13,573 --> 01:29:17,618
Tell him that I accept.

683
01:29:17,828 --> 01:29:22,076
And please, write that he brings me...

684
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:25,085
...5 meters of white satin...

685
01:29:25,252 --> 01:29:28,252
...and voile.

686
01:29:28,462 --> 01:29:32,211
You see, I cannot find here.

687
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:35,463
I understand.

688
01:29:35,677 --> 01:29:37,884
You are very kind.

689
01:29:41,015 --> 01:29:43,257
One thing more.

690
01:29:46,188 --> 01:29:47,515
You know...

691
01:29:47,689 --> 01:29:52,729
...Zorba and me,
we like you very much.

692
01:29:53,109 --> 01:29:57,274
Will you be our witness?

693
01:29:58,114 --> 01:30:00,190
It will be an honor.

694
01:36:15,997 --> 01:36:17,740
I'm sorry.

695
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:57,845
Mr. Zorba.

696
01:42:00,265 --> 01:42:02,007
Boss!

697
01:42:04,770 --> 01:42:08,185
Oh, boss.

698
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:13,435
You stink of perfume, Mr. Zorba.

699
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:18,900
Yes, I know. I scrubbed my skin for
two hours, but it still smells. It's funny.

700
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:21,234
Isn't it?

701
01:42:27,331 --> 01:42:28,990
Well, what's all this?

702
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:31,123
- Presents.
- Presents!

703
01:42:31,293 --> 01:42:34,792
- Who the hell for?
- Barba Antoni, Yianni.

704
01:42:34,962 --> 01:42:36,421
This...

705
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:41,333
...is for poor little Bouboulina.
- I hope it's a wedding dress.

706
01:42:41,511 --> 01:42:42,838
A what?

707
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:45,427
Well, you heard me.

708
01:42:48,184 --> 01:42:49,890
Boss...

709
01:42:50,726 --> 01:42:53,217
...what have you been cooking up?

710
01:42:55,606 --> 01:42:58,608
Well she was here
when your letter came.

711
01:42:58,775 --> 01:43:02,274
I couldn't very well read to her
what was in it.

712
01:43:02,445 --> 01:43:03,774
Could I?

713
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:08,069
That was not a very good joke, boss.

714
01:43:15,792 --> 01:43:18,198
What about the stuff
for the overhead cable?

715
01:43:18,377 --> 01:43:20,251
I got everything.

716
01:43:20,421 --> 01:43:21,618
Don't worry.

717
01:43:23,047 --> 01:43:25,125
A gift for you.

718
01:43:26,051 --> 01:43:30,000
A box of English chocolates.

719
01:43:32,347 --> 01:43:33,724
Thank you.

720
01:43:33,891 --> 01:43:35,515
It's all right.

721
01:43:38,228 --> 01:43:41,893
Hey, no more fooling around.

722
01:43:42,064 --> 01:43:43,606
Not in this place.

723
01:43:43,774 --> 01:43:47,641
Now we pull up our pants and we make
some money, a pile of money.

724
01:43:49,572 --> 01:43:52,572
You are incorrigible.

725
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,525
I don't know what that means,
but here.

726
01:43:56,744 --> 01:43:59,152
With my compliments.

727
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:02,873
Good God.

728
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,207
What have you done to your hair?

729
01:44:05,461 --> 01:44:07,786
- I painted it.
- Why?

730
01:44:08,338 --> 01:44:13,215
For pride. So I could go out with Lola,
without making her ashamed.

731
01:44:16,887 --> 01:44:20,967
He laughs. But listen, you know what?

732
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:24,760
I became young like my hair.

733
01:44:24,938 --> 01:44:26,845
Stronger than a bull.

734
01:44:27,023 --> 01:44:29,015
You ask Lola.

735
01:44:30,067 --> 01:44:32,818
And you know that pain
in my kidneys?

736
01:44:32,985 --> 01:44:34,266
That's gone.

737
01:44:35,195 --> 01:44:37,154
Figure that out!

738
01:44:43,996 --> 01:44:45,407
By the way, boss...

739
01:44:45,581 --> 01:44:48,867
...I come in last night,
and you were out.

740
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:52,128
Where the hell are you?

741
01:52:50,018 --> 01:52:51,595
I...

742
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,805
...couldn't help.

743
01:53:07,699 --> 01:53:09,323
Why do the young die?

744
01:53:10,953 --> 01:53:14,322
Why does anybody die? Tell me.

745
01:53:15,873 --> 01:53:17,783
I don't know.

746
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:21,792
What's the use
of all your damn books?

747
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:26,126
If they don't tell you that,
what the hell do they tell you?

748
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:30,045
They tell me...

749
01:53:31,512 --> 01:53:34,217
...about the agony of men...

750
01:53:34,932 --> 01:53:37,886
...who can't answer
questions like yours.

751
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:46,265
I spit on their agony.

752
01:54:38,698 --> 01:54:40,572
Who's that?

753
01:54:40,742 --> 01:54:42,650
It's me.

754
01:54:44,037 --> 01:54:47,203
- Boss.
- Get her inside, quickly.

755
01:54:50,292 --> 01:54:51,323
Hey.

756
01:55:02,136 --> 01:55:04,212
Did you get drenched?

757
01:55:08,391 --> 01:55:10,515
You are cruel.

758
01:55:12,311 --> 01:55:14,802
Why you abandon me?

759
01:55:15,523 --> 01:55:16,934
I will make some coffee.

760
01:55:20,569 --> 01:55:24,567
The whole village,
they're laughing at me.

761
01:55:25,992 --> 01:55:28,944
Where is my white satin?

762
01:55:29,953 --> 01:55:32,823
Where is my wedding dress?

763
01:55:35,457 --> 01:55:36,917
In Crete...

764
01:55:37,085 --> 01:55:40,536
...you don't find the real good satin.

765
01:55:40,712 --> 01:55:42,207
No!

766
01:55:43,215 --> 01:55:44,756
So...

767
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:47,506
...I ordered some.

768
01:55:47,969 --> 01:55:49,511
From Athens.

769
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,006
Yes.

770
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:54,430
Also some white candles...

771
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,260
...with silk ribbons.

772
01:55:56,435 --> 01:56:00,385
And pink bonbonničres.

773
01:56:05,568 --> 01:56:07,774
Our wedding, my dear Bouboulina...

774
01:56:07,945 --> 01:56:10,021
...will be so splendiferous...

775
01:56:10,198 --> 01:56:13,317
...it will blind the world with glory.

776
01:56:15,743 --> 01:56:18,614
I can no longer keep it a secret.

777
01:56:21,416 --> 01:56:24,998
I have engaged
the best tailors in Athens...

778
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:29,747
...to make for you a dress
like nobody has seen in the East.

779
01:56:29,923 --> 01:56:32,378
Or the West.

780
01:56:33,051 --> 01:56:37,001
Twenty meters of white satin
covered in pearls.

781
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:41,757
With the sun on one breast
and the moon on the other.

782
01:56:41,934 --> 01:56:44,305
In pure gold.

783
01:56:50,233 --> 01:56:51,894
Me too.

784
01:56:53,987 --> 01:56:56,738
I have a secret for you.

785
01:57:10,877 --> 01:57:12,454
What's that?

786
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:15,587
Open it.

787
01:57:17,632 --> 01:57:20,502
- I'll have some coffee first.
- No.

788
01:57:20,677 --> 01:57:22,088
Now.

789
01:57:27,475 --> 01:57:29,431
You see what you've done.

790
01:57:36,442 --> 01:57:38,600
Where the hell did you get these rings?

791
01:57:38,777 --> 01:57:41,065
I had them made for us.

792
01:57:41,238 --> 01:57:46,113
From two golden sovereign
the English admiral gave me.

793
01:57:46,783 --> 01:57:50,033
I was keeping them for my...

794
01:57:51,329 --> 01:57:52,658
For what?

795
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:56,498
My funeral.

796
01:58:01,838 --> 01:58:03,547
Zorba?

797
01:58:03,716 --> 01:58:06,386
Please. We become <i>fiancés.</i>

798
01:58:06,552 --> 01:58:08,130
Now.

799
01:58:08,595 --> 01:58:10,967
- But...
- We have the witness.

800
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:13,465
We have the rings.

801
01:58:13,643 --> 01:58:15,386
Please?

802
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:16,887
But we have no priest.

803
01:58:17,061 --> 01:58:19,269
I don't mind.

804
01:58:19,605 --> 01:58:21,764
God is watching.

805
01:58:22,774 --> 01:58:24,150
No?

806
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:28,149
All right.

807
01:58:28,323 --> 01:58:31,737
We go outside
where God can see us better.

808
01:58:32,951 --> 01:58:35,323
You, you get ready.

809
01:58:35,494 --> 01:58:37,572
Witness, come on.

810
01:58:50,634 --> 01:58:52,542
What do we do?

811
01:58:53,427 --> 01:58:55,052
Can you sing?

812
01:58:55,221 --> 01:58:57,592
- Certainly not.
- Never mind, I can.

813
01:58:57,806 --> 01:59:00,807
Weddings, baptisms, funerals,
I know them back to front.

814
01:59:00,976 --> 01:59:03,135
I was a boy chanter.

815
02:00:04,074 --> 02:00:05,698
It's nothing.

816
02:00:05,868 --> 02:00:07,859
Just a cold.

817
02:00:08,912 --> 02:00:11,582
Tomorrow you'll feel better.

818
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:17,291
Next Sunday we go out,
have a hell of a time.

819
02:00:18,255 --> 02:00:20,293
It's Easter, you know.

820
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:22,756
Yes.

821
02:00:23,175 --> 02:00:24,800
Yes.

822
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:33,177
You need some sun to cheer you up.

823
02:00:53,994 --> 02:00:56,118
Now, my beautiful.

824
02:00:56,288 --> 02:00:59,039
We pull everything away.

825
02:00:59,625 --> 02:01:01,083
Listen to that...

826
02:01:01,251 --> 02:01:03,743
...beautiful noise.

827
02:01:09,551 --> 02:01:11,377
Like kissing.

828
02:01:16,597 --> 02:01:18,507
Very sexy.

829
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:23,976
I'm jealous.

830
02:03:07,364 --> 02:03:09,238
- I don't want...
- No.

831
02:03:09,408 --> 02:03:12,740
- I don't know what...
- It's all right.

832
02:04:47,037 --> 02:04:48,496
Canavaro.

833
02:04:52,251 --> 02:04:53,413
Canavaro.

834
02:05:32,829 --> 02:05:35,913
It's me, Zorba.

835
02:05:36,957 --> 02:05:38,832
Don't be afraid.

836
02:08:13,765 --> 02:08:16,552
He asks us to drink to her soul.

837
02:09:28,792 --> 02:09:32,042
Zorba, what about the funeral?

838
02:09:32,378 --> 02:09:34,537
There will be no funeral.

839
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:36,547
Why?

840
02:09:36,716 --> 02:09:38,671
She was a Frank.

841
02:09:38,841 --> 02:09:41,962
She crossed herself with four fingers.

842
02:09:44,055 --> 02:09:46,131
But I don't understand.

843
02:09:47,016 --> 02:09:50,302
The priest will not bury her
like everybody else.

844
02:09:50,728 --> 02:09:53,184
- But that's dreadful.
- Why?

845
02:09:53,355 --> 02:09:55,395
She is dead.

846
02:09:55,565 --> 02:09:57,807
It makes no difference.

847
02:11:12,469 --> 02:11:14,341
Hey, boss!

848
02:11:14,511 --> 02:11:15,887
Boss!

849
02:11:16,055 --> 02:11:18,011
Come on. We are nearly ready.

850
02:11:18,181 --> 02:11:20,886
Hey, Canavaro,
you want to come and watch too?

851
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:27,724
Come on.

852
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:50,003
It's nothing. It's nothing!

853
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:53,051
The first time it always does that.

854
02:13:46,024 --> 02:13:47,766
Boss, where are you, boss?

855
02:13:47,942 --> 02:13:49,270
It's nothing.

856
02:15:49,592 --> 02:15:53,341
Hey, Canavaro. How are you?

857
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:58,427
- The lamb!
- What?

858
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:00,345
It will burn!

859
02:16:46,936 --> 02:16:48,431
You know...

860
02:16:48,604 --> 02:16:51,391
...people tell the future from this.

861
02:16:52,483 --> 02:16:54,108
Can you?

862
02:16:54,943 --> 02:16:56,603
Everything's fine.

863
02:16:56,779 --> 02:16:59,566
We will live a thousand years.

864
02:17:00,615 --> 02:17:03,154
Oh, I see a journey.

865
02:17:03,326 --> 02:17:05,995
A big journey to a city.

866
02:17:06,163 --> 02:17:08,533
With big houses.

867
02:17:15,296 --> 02:17:17,204
How soon, boss?

868
02:17:18,215 --> 02:17:20,005
I don't know.

869
02:17:20,549 --> 02:17:21,879
A few days.

870
02:17:24,094 --> 02:17:25,886
What will I do...

871
02:17:26,055 --> 02:17:27,513
...without your company?

872
02:17:27,724 --> 02:17:29,300
Cheer up.

873
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:32,342
We'll get together again.

874
02:17:32,727 --> 02:17:34,056
No.

875
02:17:34,228 --> 02:17:36,637
You'll go away and stay.

876
02:17:36,815 --> 02:17:38,972
With your books.

877
02:17:40,610 --> 02:17:42,317
Your health.

878
02:17:43,654 --> 02:17:45,941
Yours, Zorba.

879
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:54,986
Damn it, boss,
I like you too much not to say it.

880
02:17:55,164 --> 02:17:56,742
You've got everything...

881
02:17:56,916 --> 02:18:00,782
...except one thing:
madness.

882
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:04,081
A man needs a little madness,
or else...

883
02:18:04,924 --> 02:18:06,252
Or else?

884
02:18:06,424 --> 02:18:10,173
He never dares cut the rope
and be free.

885
02:18:20,478 --> 02:18:22,470
Are you angry with me?

886
02:18:32,406 --> 02:18:34,362
Teach me to dance.

887
02:18:35,243 --> 02:18:36,819
Will you?

888
02:18:38,287 --> 02:18:40,112
Dance?

889
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:45,707
Did you say dance?

890
02:18:48,962 --> 02:18:50,872
Come on, my boy.

891
02:18:59,181 --> 02:19:00,888
Together.

892
02:19:09,815 --> 02:19:11,522
Let's go.

893
02:19:19,615 --> 02:19:21,407
Again.

894
02:19:30,834 --> 02:19:32,459
Down.

895
02:19:41,176 --> 02:19:42,718
Boss...

896
02:19:42,886 --> 02:19:44,796
...I have so much to tell you.

897
02:19:46,807 --> 02:19:50,506
I never loved a man more than you.

898
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:04,941
Hey, boss...

899
02:20:05,114 --> 02:20:09,407
...did you ever see
a more splendiferous crash?

900
02:20:22,713 --> 02:20:24,209
You can laugh too, huh?

901
02:20:24,381 --> 02:20:26,956
Hey, you laugh!

902
02:20:29,262 --> 02:20:33,011
You saw... You saw how they all ran.

903
02:20:33,849 --> 02:20:37,051
Especially the monks.

904
02:20:39,104 --> 02:20:40,895
The second time...

905
02:20:41,064 --> 02:20:43,733
