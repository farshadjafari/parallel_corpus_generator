1
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,384
- Si.
- No, no.

2
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,230
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee:

3
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,189
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the...

4
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,701
No virgin, me

5
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,411
For I have sinned

6
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,288
I sold my soul

7
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,790
For sex and gin

8
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,709
Go call a priest

9
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,670
All meek and mild

10
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,672
And tell him Mary

11
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,298
Is no more a child

12
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,805
It's raining stones

13
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,973
It's raining bile

14
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,850
From the luxury

15
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,851
Of your denial

16
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,853
I press alarms

17
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,731
Place bets on truth

18
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:59,403
I'm so up and down

19
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:04,992
And now I'm growing old disgracefully

20
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,161
Whatever happened to Mary?

21
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,208
Whatever happened to Mary?

22
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,254
Whatever happened to Mary?

23
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,423
Whatever happened to Mary?

24
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,427
Whatever happened to

25
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,350
I'll spit on floors

26
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,351
And do more drugs

27
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,353
Burn every bill

28
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,355
Get drunk on love

29
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,483
Wear next to nothing...

30
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:41,778
Hey, Frankie, sweetheart! Hey, Frankie!

31
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,113
Let's get out of here.
I got work in the morning. I'm trashed.

32
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,615
Are you too tired to go home with me?

33
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,492
I might be tired, but I'm not dead.

34
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,870
I'll be uncareful

35
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,497
I'll cause such scenes

36
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,582
And I'll never talk

37
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,584
Of used-to-bes

38
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,754
Tattoo my face

39
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,880
I won't go grey

40
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,423
Be a dancing queen

41
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,593
I'm growing old disgracefully

42
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,846
I'm so up and down

43
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,559
And I love what's not allowed

44
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,560
I was lost

45
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,146
Now I see

46
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:22,903
And now I'm growing old disgracefully.

47
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,423
Oh, hi, Mom.

48
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,799
How do you do that?
How did you know that was me?

49
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,009
Of course it's you.

50
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,220
You have the most persistent
ring I know.

51
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,806
Well, I just wanted to say hi
while I'm near a phone.

52
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,267
- How are you?
- Where are you anyway?

53
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,768
Belo Quinto, near Rio.

54
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,977
- It's beautiful...
- Mom, hold on.

55
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,187
I'm getting another call.

56
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,398
Hello?

57
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,774
It's about time. Where you been, baby?

58
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,610
Ha, ha. I hate it when you just leave.

59
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,111
You could at least say good-bye.

60
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,364
- Why?
- "Why"?

61
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,657
Forget it.

62
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,243
Look, I got my mom on the other line
long distance.

63
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,413
- I'll see you tonight.
- All right, I'll see you later.

64
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,125
Mom? Hi, I'm back.
So how do you like Rio?

65
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,586
It was great. Did you get my package?

66
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,296
Yeah, I got it yesterday.

67
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,005
Well, what did you think?
Did you like it?

68
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,967
- Did you open it yet?
- Hold on, I'm gonna change phones.

69
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,100
Well, what do you think?

70
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,643
Did you get a chance
to look at everything?

71
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,519
- I'm opening it now.
- Uh-huh, and?

72
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,815
- Ooh! Ah, pretty postcards.
- Aren't those pretty?

73
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,192
- Cute brush.
- I saw a lady make that.

74
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,985
- A little hat.
- The ha... isn't that cute?

75
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,404
- It's for a little doll or something.
- A necklace.

76
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,616
Well, no, it's not really a necklace.
It's a rosary.

77
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,826
Where'd you get it?

78
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,452
This little village called Belo Quinto.

79
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,581
- I didn't even know you went there.
- I took a little side trip over here.

80
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,582
So what do you think of the presents?
Do you love 'em?

81
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,668
I'm so glad I got a chance
to talk to you.

82
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,836
I'm going on that cruise.
I'm not gonna talk to you for a month.

83
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,880
- And I have to run.
- Okay, have fun. I love you.

84
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,259
- I love you, too, sweetie, bye-bye.
- I'm glad you called, Mom. Bye.

85
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,279
Can I get two lattes, please? Low-fat.

86
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,533
- Yeah, got it.
- Just one. You know, I'm okay.

87
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,576
Let me get
a bacon and egg sandwich, too.

88
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,245
- To go.
- Coming up.

89
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,788
What's up? You're not eating today?

90
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,874
I threw up this morning
from the smell of tea.

91
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,292
Oh, God.

92
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,543
Late?

93
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,921
- Like, a week.
- A week?

94
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,798
I don't know, a few days.
Kinda feel weird.

95
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,509
You're so dramatic.

96
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,596
I think you're just
psyching yourself out.

97
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:41,078
I feel like my heart
went to go live in my stomach.

98
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:43,269
Okay, it's not dramatic.

99
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,355
- What if I'm having a baby?
- With Steven?

100
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,231
What if I'm bringing a person
into this world?

101
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,567
Man, what if? You've got options.

102
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,818
You know what?
I don't want to think about it.

103
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,736
- It's making me cranky.
- Here's your to-go.

104
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,447
You know what,
let's get our tired asses to work...

105
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,408
- Thanks. Hold this.
- ...'cause we are late.

106
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,409
You're always late. There's nothing new.

107
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,514
Father Andrew Kiernan, welcome back.

108
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,890
Cardinal Houseman.

109
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,351
These are interesting. What's the trick?

110
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,895
Well, to be honest, I don't know.

111
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,230
They probably made a fortune out of her.

112
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,817
And, uh, what's... what was this?

113
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,402
Infrared photographs of tears.

114
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,863
The statue is made of stone,
therefore room temperature.

115
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,573
But the tears show up
as white because, um...

116
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,659
because they're warm.

117
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,913
- Warm tears?
- Yes.

118
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,414
My lab report and analysis confirm

119
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:31,378
that the blood from the statue
is not only warm, but human.

120
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,091
I know what you're thinking.

121
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,884
But with all due respect, Daniel,
this isn't a fake.

122
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,720
It's a freestanding mass of solid stone.

123
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,514
And there is no scientific explanation.

124
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,015
Andrew, it's my understanding
you were sent to Brazil

125
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,601
in order to investigate the appearance
of the Virgin Mary

126
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,894
on the side of a building.

127
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,980
Yes, but while I was in Sao Paulo,
I heard about the statue,

128
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,692
- so I decided to go and investigate.
- And?

129
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,984
And what?

130
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,485
The face of the Virgin Mary
on the building.

131
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:00,740
It's an oxidation stain
caused by rainwater

132
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,575
running down untreated side walls,

133
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,077
causes an optical illusion
of a veiled woman.

134
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,746
Good.
We'll consider the matter closed, then.

135
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,958
Father Dario has your next assignment.

136
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,671
I was hoping that perhaps
you could send me back to, um...

137
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,297
to Belo Quinto.

138
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,506
Why?

139
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,592
Because I need to do
some more tests on the statue.

140
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,388
You're telling me you left the statue
in Belo Quinto?

141
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,972
Yes.

142
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,640
I was going to take it back, obviously,

143
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,309
but when I saw the effect that it had
on the people... it's amazing.

144
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,938
It's become almost like
a cornerstone of their faith.

145
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,400
Andrew, the cornerstone
of their faith is the Church,

146
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,110
not a crying statue.

147
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,696
When you're in the field,

148
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,822
you're a representative
of the Catholic Church

149
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,991
and the Congregation
of the Causes of the Saints.

150
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,744
Yes, I'm very well aware
of that, Daniel.

151
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,955
I am also a scientist
and I observe the facts.

152
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,667
And the facts are that this statue
has tears of blood.

153
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,794
Well, if that's the case,
you know the policy.

154
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,130
The statue is brought back
to the Vatican.

155
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,923
We conduct expert tests...

156
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,135
geologists, engineers,
medical examiners.

157
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,307
We've examined 50 or 60 crying statues
in the last 12 months.

158
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,807
Not a single one of them
has turned out...

159
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,852
Yes, I'm very well aware of that,
but I just wanted you to know

160
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,774
that in my opinion,
I think that this is different.

161
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,317
I'm not going to allow you
to go back to Brazil.

162
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,111
We'll get a geologist down there,
and if he sees fit,

163
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,530
we'll get the statue sent back
for further tests.

164
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,491
Father Dario, get me
all the information you can

165
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,994
on this church in Belo Quinto,
would you?

166
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,413
Thank you, Andrew.

167
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,625
Thank you.

168
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:45,302
I have never seen him this way before.

169
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,681
Andrew's problem is he can't decide
if he's a scientist or a priest.

170
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,269
Frankie, come on.

171
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,148
- You are gonna drive yourself crazy.
- No.

172
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,649
If you're worried about being pregnant,

173
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,485
why don't we go to the store
right now and get a test?

174
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,278
Well, let's just give it
a couple of days, okay?

175
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,572
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

176
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,115
And stop mothering me. Yes.

177
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,784
All right, girlfriend.
I'll call you later.

178
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,995
Okay, bye. Drive safe.

179
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,606
- Late?
- Like, a week.

180
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:42,902
You're always late. There's nothing new.

181
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,153
What if I'm bringing
a person into this world?

182
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,323
Frankie, you've got options.

183
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,286
Nurse, somebody needs
to tell me what's going on.

184
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:59,663
- I don't understand.
- Get out of the way!

185
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,208
Frankie, can you hear me?
I'm right here with you.

186
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,750
Let's go!

187
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,211
I don't understand
why there's so much blood.

188
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,755
- Get me a clamp right now.
- Frankie!

189
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,883
All right, CBC, electrolytes,
UA, tox screen.

190
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,721
Get me a pulse ox, STAT!

191
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,557
- Get me a tox screen and a STAT CT.
- Right away.

192
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,974
Heart rate is irregular.

193
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,185
Blood pressure's off the map.
195 over 120.

194
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,396
- Let's change cuffs.
- Where's the IV?

195
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,657
I'm calling it, code blue!
Get the paddles.

196
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,201
Get some gel. Okay, ready?

197
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,121
- Mark, get the paddle.
- All right, clear!

198
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,623
Temperature and blood pressure
are back to normal.

199
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,251
Who are you?

200
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,422
I'm Dr. Reston.
Do you know what your name is?

201
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,257
What happened? Where am I?

202
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,842
You're in the emergency room.

203
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,010
You were found unconscious
in your apartment.

204
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,262
- Do you remember anything?
- No.

205
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,516
Oh, Jesus.
Can I get some more help over here?

206
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,685
We need some four-by-fours.
We have a very deep laceration here.

207
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,271
Oh, my God, it's gone right through.

208
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,731
Miss, you can't go in there.

209
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,442
- I'm sorry, Doctor, I just need to...
- Please have a seat.

210
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,109
I just need to know
what's going on with her.

211
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,321
She'll be fine.
Please have a seat. Thank you.

212
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,326
These are puncture wounds, Frankie,
caused by the entry of a sharp object.

213
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,952
Are you in any pain?

214
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,873
No. That's weird, isn't it?

215
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,460
Wow, will you look at that?
It only bleeds when I touch it.

216
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,086
Maybe you should not touch it.

217
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,006
Both wounds are identical...
the same size, same shape.

218
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,009
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimeter.

219
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,346
You keep saying "she,"
but I didn't do this.

220
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,432
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

221
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,351
Do you have a lot of stress at work?

222
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,185
I cut hair.

223
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,189
Do you have any trouble
with a significant other?

224
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,607
- Yes.
- And that is?

225
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,652
I'm not very significant.

226
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,072
Look, how long is this gonna take?
I wanna go home.

227
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,740
I think you should stay here
at least 24 hours for observation.

228
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,368
- We need to get a handle on this.
- There's nothing to get a handle on.

229
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,621
Frankie, I'm not gonna kid you...
with wounds like this,

230
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,915
it's pretty obvious
that they were self-inflicted.

231
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,417
You think I did this?

232
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,003
It would never happen.

233
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,799
I love being me. Ask anyone.

234
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,195
Frankie, turn the light off, honey,
and come to bed.

235
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:47,664
Do you smell flowers
in here or something?

236
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,876
No.

237
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,088
Smells like jasmine
or hyacinth or something.

238
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,592
I don't smell anything.

239
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,471
Mmm. You need anything?

240
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,015
No.

241
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,478
- Good night.
- Good night.

242
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,503
Grazie, signore.

243
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,924
Duty-free.

244
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,596
- Welcome back, Andrew.
- Gianni, come stai?

245
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,723
Sto bene. Ah, God is good.

246
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,726
So how was Belo Quinto?

247
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,645
How do you know about Belo Quinto?
I was sent to Sao Paulo.

248
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,065
God lives here, remember?
We know everything.

249
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,817
- Oh, yes, I forgot.
- So how are you doing?

250
00:22:57,616 --> 00:22:59,528
I don't know.

251
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:01,739
I don't know.

252
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:06,535
I travel round the world
investigating miracles.

253
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:08,119
And then I disprove them.

254
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,580
The real miracle
is anybody believes anything.

255
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,334
I don't know what I'm doing,
to tell you the truth.

256
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,544
None of us know what we are doing.

257
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,172
- So what are you working on?
- I have no idea.

258
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,478
Well, how can you translate something
if you've no idea?

259
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:23,094
I'm a linguist, Andrew.

260
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,596
I translate words, not their relevance.

261
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,307
But this one is a second century gospel.

262
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,017
How many is that you're up to now?

263
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,894
I've helped translate about 15.

264
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,522
That only leaves 20 still to go.

265
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,984
So there are, what, 35 gospels?

266
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,487
Everyone had a different experience
of Jesus,

267
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,780
so they all wrote different stories.

268
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,117
You see, all the gospels,
they're interpretations.

269
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:51,329
They're memories, dreams, reflections.

270
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,000
And there's no one gospel
in Jesus' actual words?

271
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,877
We're all blind men in a cave

272
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:02,173
looking for a candle
that was lit 2,000 years ago.

273
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:03,968
So what's in this text?

274
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,596
- I was only given every third page.
- Why?

275
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:12,058
The most sensitive documents are always
divided into threes among us...

276
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,061
one-third to the Dominicans,
one-third to the Franciscans,

277
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,355
and one-third to us Jesuits.

278
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:22,403
The truth of any document
is only known to a very powerful few.

279
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,905
That's typical of this place, isn't it?

280
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,868
We live in a highly competitive
world, Andrew.

281
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,830
- The Church is no exception.
- Hmm.

282
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:36,709
Nothing ever gets out of here, does it?

283
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,586
Unless, of course, they want it to.

284
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,760
Both wounds are identical...
same size, same shape.

285
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,262
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimeter.

286
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,097
You think I did this?

287
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,351
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

288
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,109
So, Jen, tell us about your date.

289
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,862
It was with a tax lawyer.

290
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,030
- A tax lawyer?
- Yeah.

291
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,824
But when I first met him,
he seemed really cool.

292
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:11,493
- Hey.
- Hey, hi, guys.

293
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:12,787
- Hey, Frankie.
- How you feeling?

294
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,330
Fine.

295
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,460
Really okay or just okay?

296
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,378
I'm fine.

297
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,712
So how's my day looking?

298
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,633
Well, I started your first client,
and you're booked solid until 7:00.

299
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,093
Thanks.

300
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,385
Wanna come over here?

301
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,304
Okay, well, go back to Jen
and dish the dirt.

302
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,102
So, uh, he seemed pretty cool.

303
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,105
Divorced, but no kids.

304
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,566
But he left the table
in the middle of dinner

305
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,777
to call his mother in Oregon.

306
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,238
Major points for the long-distance mom.

307
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,865
Yeah. You know,
I thought I'd give him a shot.

308
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:53,451
But you won't believe what he did.

309
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:57,288
Every single time he took
a bite of his steak...

310
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:58,790
he growled.

311
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,250
He growled!

312
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:56,307
Shit!

313
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,183
Stop! There's a baby!

314
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:00,519
Frankie!

315
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,688
- Stop! Wait!
- Hey, lady!

316
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,107
- There's a baby! Stop!
- Crazy bitch!

317
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,609
Frankie, what are you doing?!

318
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,487
- What's your problem?
- You crazy or what?

319
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,990
Where's the baby?

320
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,910
- Frankie!
- Watch it, lady!

321
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,746
- Frankie!
- Where's the lady? Did you see her?

322
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,830
- Frankie.
- She dropped her baby!

323
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,000
- Frankie, there's no baby, honey.
- Jeez.

324
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,170
There's no baby and there's no lady.

325
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,672
- What's happening?
- No, honey, it's...

326
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:31,424
It's okay, honey.

327
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:33,844
Take the night off, okay?

328
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,471
There was a lady. I saw her!

329
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,848
- There was not a lady.
- She dropped her baby.

330
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,935
I swear. I swear.

331
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,271
I just wanna get you home, okay?

332
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,660
You all right?

333
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,163
We'll be home in a minute.

334
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,128
- Frankie...
- Hey, you!

335
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,257
- Are you speaking to me?
- Are you Andrew Kiernan?

336
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,510
Andrew Kiernan?
No. My name's Father Durning.

337
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,016
May I help you?

338
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,103
No one can help me now. I'm fucked.

339
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,107
All passengers, please exit the train.

340
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,609
Wait on the platform for assistance.

341
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,945
Somebody help!

342
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,678
- Ah!
- Frankie Paige?

343
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,182
We're gonna schedule some more tests
for this afternoon around 4:00.

344
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,351
Did you run a pregnancy test?

345
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,561
Um... yes.

346
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,314
Am I pregnant?

347
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:15,773
No.

348
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,736
- Was I?
- I don't know.

349
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,430
Take this, all of you,
and drink from it,

350
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,807
for this is the cup of my blood,

351
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:52,769
shed for you and for all men
so that sins may be forgiven.

352
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,189
Do this in memory of me.

353
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,567
This is the blood of Christ.

354
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,366
This is the blood of Christ.

355
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,417
This is the blood of Christ.

356
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,118
Well, am I psychotic or dying or both?

357
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,197
Well, none of the above.

358
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,740
Actually, I think that
you're quite rational,

359
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,037
and despite the wounds you suffered,
you're in very good health.

360
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,874
There is another possibility
that is of concern.

361
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,210
Epilepsy.

362
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,170
Epilepsy?

363
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,713
We've run some preliminary tests,

364
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,384
and all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

365
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,887
But that seems impossible.

366
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,807
How can you just wake up one day
and have that?

367
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,936
Well, you can't, but, uh, you've
described blunt trauma to the head,

368
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,980
disturbing hallucinations.

369
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,317
You're hearing voices.
These could all indicate epilepsy.

370
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,902
So what do we do now?

371
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:28,990
We're going to insert some electrodes
into the upper neocortex.

372
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,867
Wait a minute, wait.

373
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,703
You want to put wires inside my head?

374
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:38,625
Frankie, we're gonna do whatever we can
to find out what's causing this.

375
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:40,336
You hang in there.

376
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,855
Epilepsy? They don't know
what they're talking about, Frankie.

377
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,565
I think you should get a second opinion.

378
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,401
Miss Paige? I'm Father Durning.

379
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,444
You spoke to me on the train?

380
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,070
Oh. Yeah?

381
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,072
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened.

382
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,282
Why?

383
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,327
Do you know what the stigmata are?

384
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:16,954
Uh, Father, I gotta
get Frankie home, thanks.

385
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:21,083
I understand how you feel, but please
call me if you change your mind.

386
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,545
Okay.

387
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,717
Ah, Andrew, come in.

388
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,929
I think we've found
your next assignment.

389
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,931
I was hoping that perhaps
you'd changed your mind

390
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,681
about sending me to Belo Quinto.

391
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,768
We have no record
of a church in Belo Quinto.

392
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,938
What?

393
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,190
That's impossible.
There must be some mistake.

394
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,568
No mistake, Father.
I have checked into it myself.

395
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,072
If there is a church in Belo Quinto,
it is not one of ours.

396
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:53,324
And no record of a priest
assigned to that village either.

397
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,202
This was sent to us
by a Father Durning in Pittsburgh

398
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,163
from the train's security camera.

399
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,583
What, uh... what are we supposed
to be looking for?

400
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,043
Watch.

401
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,380
Stop.

402
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,092
Obviously it is some sort of attack.

403
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,052
Maybe possession.

404
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,637
The wrists are bandaged.

405
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,306
According to Father Durning,

406
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:20,726
she was whipped repeatedly
by an unseen force.

407
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,438
How important is this really, Daniel?

408
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,731
We don't know yet.

409
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:27,317
Then why are you sending me?

410
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,612
Because of this clipping
from the "Pittsburgh Globe."

411
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,449
"20 terrified witnesses,
unexplained wounds,

412
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,284
Catholic priest."

413
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,786
The publicity is unfortunate,

414
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,956
but I'm sure by the time I get there,
it'll be completely blown over.

415
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,168
We're investigating this one.

416
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,690
You know what I heard?

417
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,318
Catholic priest in the paper said
that it was some like...

418
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,072
- Hey, Frankie!
- Hey, Frankie.

419
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,532
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

420
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,161
Hey, I feel like I should do
a monologue or something.

421
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:22,289
Hey, Cheryl.

422
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,208
Come on over here and have a seat.
I'll just be a second.

423
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:28,838
Um, you know what?
I think I'm just gonna wait for Donna.

424
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,007
Oh. Okay.

425
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,059
- What's going on with her?
- She wants to get a second opinion.

426
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,436
They think she might have epilepsy.

427
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,938
Epilepsy? She doesn't look too good.

428
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,152
Why is she even at work?

429
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,364
Hey, would you guys stop whispering
like this was a goddamn church?

430
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,539
- Hi.
- Hello.

431
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,373
You have an appointment or...?

432
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,418
No, I... I don't.

433
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,588
Well, would you like a haircut,
a manicure,

434
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,215
or maybe you'd like
to have your nipples pierced?

435
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,010
Well, maybe if we just start
with a trim,

436
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,304
we could go from there?

437
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,891
- Thank you.
- Come on. Have a seat.

438
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,436
All right, here we go.

439
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,106
I'm gonna put this cape on
so you don't get a scratchy neck.

440
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,692
Ah, thank you.

441
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,445
So where are you from?

442
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,197
I live in Rome, actually.

443
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,949
Ooh, cool.

444
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,867
- And you?
- I'm from Naples.

445
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:44,121
- Ah, Naples.
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,206
Naples, la citta piu bella del mondo.

447
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,668
Naples, Florida.

448
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,045
- I moved here to go to school.
- Which school?

449
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:56,632
Claudia's University of Cosmetology.

450
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:00,429
- See? I'm accredited.
- Oh. Cool.

451
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,891
Am I going crazy
or is Frankie hitting on a priest?

452
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,143
What do I call you?

453
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,936
I feel kind of weird calling a guy
I could date "Father."

454
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,775
I mean, I couldn't date you,
but... you know.

455
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,469
Oh, no, no, no. You just made my day.

456
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:19,739
Thank you. You can call me Andrew.

457
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,284
Andrew Kiernan, that's my name.

458
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:28,940
Donna.

459
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:38,382
I know this is gonna sound
kinda strange, but...

460
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,302
I've sorta been expecting you.

461
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,311
So you live in Rome?

462
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,063
Yes, but I travel a great deal,
so I'm rarely there.

463
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,606
- Thank you.
- Coffee, honey?

464
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,650
No, thanks.
So what brings you to Pennsylvania?

465
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,445
Well, Father Durning asked us
to come and speak to you, Miss Paige.

466
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,364
Us? Who's us?
I thought you were a priest.

467
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,576
Well, I am a priest,
but I'm also an investigator.

468
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,327
I work for a division in the Vatican

469
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:10,414
called the Congregation
for the Causes of the Saints.

470
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,500
Do you mind if I switch this on?

471
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,585
- No, go ahead.
- Thank you.

472
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,005
What is... what is your full name?

473
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,423
Frankie Paige.

474
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,010
- And your age?
- 23.

475
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,262
And which church do you attend?

476
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,097
I don't attend church.

477
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,224
But you are Catholic.

478
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,603
No, I don't go to church
because I don't believe in God.

479
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,693
Well, that's... gonna be it for me.

480
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,028
That's all I need to know, Miss Paige.

481
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,864
- That's it?
- Yes.

482
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,036
You see, stigmatics
are deeply religious people.

483
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,871
- And there's no exceptions?
- No.

484
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,791
Well, why do they get stigmata?

485
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:58,003
When Christ died on the cross, he...
he died with five wounds.

486
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:00,215
His back was scourged by whips.

487
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:04,094
There were gashes in his forehead
from a crown of thorns.

488
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,389
There were nails driven
through his hands and feet.

489
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,811
And finally, a spear
driven through his side.

490
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,775
Throughout history,
only deeply devout people

491
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,862
have been afflicted with these wounds.

492
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:24,572
Well, why?

493
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,367
There really is no satisfactory
scientific explanation.

494
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:31,621
All stigmatics are haunted
by such intense spiritual pain,

495
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,914
in some ways it affects them physically.

496
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,293
They're assaulted
by their own visions of evil,

497
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:39,128
and they manifest this battle
in their bodies.

498
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,465
The Church, on the other hand,
regards it as a gift,

499
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,009
a gift from God.

500
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,340
A gift? Can I give it back?

501
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,476
Listen, Father...

502
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,438
ahem, can I show you these,
and you could tell me what you think?

503
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,525
Yes. Yes, of course.

504
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,724
Coffee, honey?

505
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,518
Well, what do you think?

506
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:38,103
Well, it doesn't really matter
what I think, Miss Paige.

507
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,481
What does that mean?

508
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:42,358
It means officially,
this is not a case for the Church.

509
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:47,112
To say that a self-confessed atheist
exhibits the wounds of Christ

510
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,405
is a contradiction in terms.

511
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,701
Look, you know what? Here. Read that.

512
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,786
I found that on my kitchen table
the other morning.

513
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,289
Now, I don't know what that says,
but that handwriting is mine.

514
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,000
It's Italian.

515
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,838
It says, "Split a piece of wood,
and I'm there.

516
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,715
Lift a stone, and you will find me."

517
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,344
It's quite beautiful, actually.

518
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,054
This isn't beautiful. This is a warning!

519
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,806
- It means no matter what I do...
- Miss Paige!

520
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:16,101
...no matter where I go,
I can't escape this.

521
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,978
Miss Paige,
I would really like to help you...

522
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,938
You know what? You know what?
This is not going anywhere.

523
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,608
You don't know what this is.
You can't give me any kind of answer.

524
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,610
Coffee's on me. Here.

525
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,936
There really is no satisfactory
scientific explanation.

526
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:06,652
Stigmatics are deeply religious people.

527
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,572
We're gonna do whatever
we can to find out,

528
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,284
but, all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

529
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:19,496
Throughout history, only people
who believe deeply in God

530
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,498
have been afflicted with these wounds.

531
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,501
The nearer they come to God,

532
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,547
the more open they are
to the torment of their demons.

533
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,677
The Church regards it as a gift,
a gift from God.

534
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,728
Whoo-hoo!

535
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:46,442
- Here's to Friday night!
- Yeah, Friday night, honey.

536
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,739
Frankie!

537
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,117
Don't worry about it.
Just order another drink.

538
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,369
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check it out.

539
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,163
But you just can't tell

540
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,333
Don't hold your breath, but the pretty
things are going to hell...

541
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,460
- Hey, girlfriend. What's up?
- Hey.

542
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,170
I thought you were staying home
to get some rest.

543
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,463
Have you seen Steven?

544
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,632
Man, forget about Steven.
What's up with that priest?

545
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:16,304
Believe me, he's all business.
Hey, can we get two doubles each?

546
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,931
Hey, you know what's scarier
than not believing in God?

547
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,432
Believing in Him.

548
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,268
I mean, really believing in Him
is a fucking terrifying thought.

549
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,478
It's Friday night.

550
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,231
I think you're taking things
a little too seriously.

551
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,150
'Cause If there is a God,
then He hates me

552
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,610
'cause He's ruining my life.

553
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,528
Come on, Frankie,
it's gonna be all right, man.

554
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,739
- Relax.
- You don't get it, do you?

555
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,617
I have fucking holes through my wrists!

556
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,619
I have slashes across my back!

557
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,206
If it isn't God that's doing this to me,
then who is?

558
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,543
I think you're losing it, man.

559
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,213
Where you goin'?

560
00:44:52,806 --> 00:44:54,092
Frankie!

561
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,436
Frankie! Oh, God!

562
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:08,773
Frankie, get up! Get up!

563
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:10,983
Frankie...

564
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,487
Frankie, it's all right. Frankie!

565
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,911
Don't just fuckin' stand there!
Somebody call an ambulance!

566
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,121
Damn.

567
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,844
Frankie, where are you?

568
00:45:51,492 --> 00:45:52,733
Get outta there!

569
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,052
Miss Paige?

570
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,726
Miss Paige!

571
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,114
Miss Paige?

572
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:44,452
Miss Paige!

573
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,293
Miss Paige?

574
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,340
Miss Paige!

575
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,438
Miss Paige?

576
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,135
Frankie!

577
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,733
- Let's get you out of here.
- Frankie.

578
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,360
We need to get her to a safe place.

579
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,532
Here, I got you. I got you.

580
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,527
Welcome back.

581
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,195
Where am I?

582
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,447
You're in Father Durning's church.

583
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,784
Hey.

584
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,954
I think she should get some rest.

585
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,708
You all right?

586
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:42,630
You look like shit.

587
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,882
It smells like...

588
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,135
flowers.

589
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,889
You got stuff all in your hair.

590
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,329
Pronto.

591
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,331
- Gianni, come stai?
- Andrew, how are you?

592
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:20,960
Gianni, listen, could you help me
with a translation?

593
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,628
- Si. Do you have it there?
- Yes, I have it here.

594
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:25,673
- Read it to me.
- I'll play it for you now.

595
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,559
Thama...

596
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,936
Well, what is it? Is it gibberish?

597
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,148
No, no, no, it's not gibberish at all.

598
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,233
Andrew, who is speaking these words?

599
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,097
Good morning, Miss Paige.
You're up early.

600
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,181
Hey. I think you made a mistake.

601
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,809
- What do you mean?
- I can't have stigmata.

602
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,230
Jesus was crucified through
the palms of his hands, not his wrists.

603
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,273
And look at my wounds.
They're through the wrists.

604
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,565
So you're wrong.

605
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,362
Actually, scientists have discovered
that in Roman times,

606
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,574
people were crucified
through the wrists, not the palms.

607
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:18,119
There's no way that the hands
could have supported the weight of body,

608
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,998
so they did crucify them
through the wrists.

609
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,626
No, wait, you're telling me
that every painting,

610
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:29,170
every statue of Christ,
every single crucifix

611
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,715
in the whole world is wrong?

612
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,467
No, no, just inaccurate.

613
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,594
They're impressions of the truth.

614
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,472
Icons are meant to be inspirational.

615
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:43,643
Miss Paige, there's something else
you should know.

616
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:47,398
The words you keep repeating
that, uh, you thought were nonsense...

617
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,733
well, it's not.

618
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,152
It's actually a very specific language.

619
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,280
It's a form of Aramaic.

620
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,780
What?

621
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,117
It's a form of Aramaic
that hasn't been used for 1,900 years.

622
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,664
It's a dialect that was used in Galilee
around the time of Jesus.

623
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,373
"Split a piece of wood and I am there.

624
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,336
Lift a stone and you will find me."

625
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,851
- Did you get through?
- No.

626
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,853
Her machine didn't even pick up.

627
00:55:14,822 --> 00:55:16,943
Miss Paige?

628
00:55:17,737 --> 00:55:19,643
Miss Paige?

629
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,416
Frankie?

630
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,384
Frankie?

631
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,650
Frankie...

632
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:23,739
Frankie.

633
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,744
Who are you?

634
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,777
I feel like my heart is breaking.

635
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,617
Why am I so sad?

636
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,876
It smells like flowers in here.

637
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,670
Like...

638
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,923
jasmine or...

639
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,635
rose or something.

640
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,639
- Can you smell that?
- Yes, I can.

641
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,811
- Who wrote that?
- You did.

642
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,106
- I wrote that?
- Yes.

643
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:18,038
Have you heard from Father Andrew?

644
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,248
No, Eminence.

645
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,541
He hasn't filed a report
since he got there.

646
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,751
What are these?

647
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,503
These are newspaper clippings
from our office in New York.

648
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,047
The first one is from Pennsylvania.

649
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,385
The others are from New York
and Washington.

650
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:35,556
These are even more damaging.
This one mentions the stigmata.

651
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,182
He doesn't seem to be
defusing the situation.

652
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:39,809
Shall I call him home?

653
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,438
Have him conclude
his investigation immediately,

654
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:45,065
present his report to me
in New York at the end of next week.

655
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:53,614
Frankie, can you please come over here
and have a look at this?

656
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,827
I... I just can't believe that
none of this means anything to you.

657
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,500
Frankie?

658
01:00:06,574 --> 01:00:08,088
Frankie.

659
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,719
Frankie, can you please?

660
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,681
Can you please look at this?

661
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:21,934
Sometimes subjects retain
fragments or images

662
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,771
that can be transmitted
subconsciously and...

663
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,775
This subject doesn't retain
fragments of images.

664
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,277
You don't get it,
do you, Father Kiernan?

665
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,655
I don't know what the hell that means!

666
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,867
I don't know what the hell this means.
I just want my life back, okay?

667
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:49,086
I'm sitting amongst yourselves

668
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:53,884
Don't think you can see me

669
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:58,472
I haven't gone anywhere

670
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,143
But out of my body

671
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:08,273
Reach out and touch me

672
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:13,110
Make effort to speak to me

673
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:17,865
Call out and you'll hear me

674
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:22,663
Be happy for me...

675
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:23,996
Miss Paige?

676
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,416
Miss Paige, I, uh... I'm sorry.

677
01:01:27,516 --> 01:01:30,963
Don't "Miss Paige" me
just because you messed up.

678
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:33,047
I'm not gonna let you off the hook.

679
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,592
Okay, but, uh... I am sorry.

680
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,804
You know, for a priest,
you're pretty relentless.

681
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:44,351
Yeah, I guess I stopped being a priest
and slipped back into being a scientist.

682
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,561
It, uh... it happens.

683
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,773
Hey, what kind of a scientist
is a priest, anyway?

684
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,817
You don't want to know.

685
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,610
Oh, yes, I do.

686
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,737
You were an organic chemist?

687
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,407
Okay, did you walk around
with those glasses

688
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:03,327
with Scotch tape around the sides
and pocket protectors?

689
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:06,289
I did, actually.

690
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:10,210
Anyway, one day, I just decided
that I was going to become a priest.

691
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,420
Well, why?

692
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,547
- The holes.
- The holes?

693
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,340
- Mm, the holes in the theories.
- What theories?

694
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,969
The world is six billion years old,
right?

695
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,262
There's been life on this planet
for three billion years,

696
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,974
but for three billion years before that,
there was nothing.

697
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:27,436
No life. Just a bunch of elements
swirling around.

698
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:30,813
And then one day,
for no apparent reason whatsoever,

699
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,400
all these elements
came together in perfect harmony,

700
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,027
and there was suddenly life,

701
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:39,822
living things like lilac and...
and hedgehogs and snails...

702
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,284
- Beer and cheesecake.
- Beer and cheesecake.

703
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,286
Did you know that monks
invented alcohol?

704
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,581
- Yeah. Everybody knows that.
- You knew that?

705
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,206
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

706
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:51,501
Well, anyway, to get back
to the big hole.

707
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,085
There really...

708
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,797
There really isn't any explanation.

709
01:02:55,896 --> 01:02:59,967
And I figured that there was
something more than...

710
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,637
well, more important
than organic chemistry going on,

711
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,222
and I figured that it was God

712
01:03:05,322 --> 01:03:08,809
and that God was responsible
for all this life.

713
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:12,396
- I really can't get a line on you.
- Why not?

714
01:03:12,496 --> 01:03:14,858
First of all, I can't understand
a man who's never, you know.

715
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,610
Never made love to a woman?

716
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,364
Well, ahem, this may come
as a great surprise to you,

717
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,034
but... I wasn't born a priest.

718
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,746
- But you didn't like it?
- Well, what's not to like?

719
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,456
- But you don't miss it?
- Yes, of course I miss it.

720
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,833
I mean, I'm human, you know?

721
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:36,963
I struggle with it,
but I've made a choice.

722
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,882
Basically, what I've done
is I've exchanged

723
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,135
one set of complications for another.

724
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,967
Frankie.

725
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:43,947
Frankie...

726
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,960
So this is the fourth?

727
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,463
- What do you mean?
- When I first met you,

728
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,632
didn't you say that
there were five wounds?

729
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,050
Well, this is the fourth.

730
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,929
What's the fifth?

731
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,849
The spear.

732
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,059
That's the wound that killed him.

733
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,103
Don't worry, Frankie.

734
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,773
No stigmatic has ever received
the full five wounds.

735
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,318
Have you ever met another person
who had stigmata?

736
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,780
I did make a pilgrimage
to a small village

737
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,324
in the mountains of Southern Italy.

738
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,409
There I met a priest called Padre Pio.

739
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,079
He first received the wounds
when he was 23 years of age,

740
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:36,416
the same age as Saint Francis of Assisi.

741
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,335
Who's Saint Francis of Assisi?

742
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,713
Saint Francis was the first person
to receive the stigmata,

743
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,298
in the 13th century.

744
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:48,052
He was a wild young man,
but he suddenly changed his ways

745
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:51,431
after he'd had a vision
of being crucified alongside Christ.

746
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,516
When he woke up,

747
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,896
his hands and his feet were...
were bleeding.

748
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,606
This priest, were his wounds
as bad as mine?

749
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,108
Padre Pio.

750
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,360
Sometimes he lost a pint of blood a day

751
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,072
and he suffered
terrible demonic attacks.

752
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,280
A priest?

753
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:12,994
All stigmatics suffer
the most intense spiritual conflict.

754
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,954
The nearer they come to God,

755
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:18,541
the more open they are to temptation,
to evil visions...

756
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,045
to the torment of their demons.

757
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,673
There was also a smell
which accompanied the wounds,

758
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,550
the odor of sanctity, the smell of...

759
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,010
Flowers.

760
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,931
Yes, flowers.

761
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,059
Well, what happened to him?

762
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,978
How many wounds did he receive?

763
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,521
He...

764
01:06:41,056 --> 01:06:43,190
He lived to old age.

765
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,860
How many wounds did he receive?

766
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,367
Two.

767
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,041
I'm dying, aren't I?

768
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,922
This thing is killing me.

769
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,447
Here's a closer shot.

770
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,615
My guess is it's probably Aramaic.

771
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,494
Aspetta. I'm looking at it.

772
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,123
Is there a...
is there a problem, Gianni?

773
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,458
Yes, don't send me any more
of these pictures.

774
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,960
- How many did you send?
- Six. Why?

775
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,797
- The problem is what it says.
- Well, what does it say?

776
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:52,344
It says, "The kingdom of God
is inside you

777
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,094
and all about you."

778
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,972
Andrew, forget you saw this.
Drop it immediately.

779
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:59,099
- Don't send me any more...
- Gianni, what is the problem?

780
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:00,601
Do you remember the Gospels...

781
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,231
Gianni?

782
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,983
Gianni, are you still there? Gianni?

783
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,735
Do you remember the Gospels Commission?

784
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:13,239
It was closed down suddenly
by your friend Cardinal Houseman.

785
01:08:13,338 --> 01:08:15,240
Yes, a few years ago, yes.

786
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:18,912
We discovered a document that looked
like it was a completely new gospel.

787
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,997
Well, what's the significance of that?

788
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:24,042
I was one of the three translators
of this gospel.

789
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,627
It was written entirely in Aramaic,

790
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:30,090
the language of Jesus and his disciples.

791
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:33,594
It may be Jesus' actual words.
His own...

792
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:35,908
Where is it now?

793
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:40,809
Gianni? What's going on?

794
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,686
Gianni, are you there? Gianni?

795
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,902
Buona sera.

796
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:55,908
What's this?

797
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,622
- Is that a painting?
- No, it's a mirror.

798
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:04,957
Well, who else was in the room?

799
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:06,501
I don't know.

800
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,337
I thought you said it was just you two.

801
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,422
16-A. Do you have the neg?

802
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,926
Who is that?

803
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,101
I'll be back as soon as I can.

804
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,296
- Cardinal Houseman.
- I'm late for a meeting with a courier.

805
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:54,048
At your discretion,
but I think this might be of interest.

806
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:55,384
What is it?

807
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,765
Where did you get this?

808
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,309
It was emailed to Father Delmonico.

809
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:07,145
- By whom?
- Father Kiernan in Pittsburgh.

810
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,774
- Do you know what it means?
- No.

811
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,817
Is it important?

812
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,695
Uh, will you tell the meeting
I'll be with them in a few minutes?

813
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,457
Who is it?

814
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:12,279
Hi, come in. The door's open.

815
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,095
- Frankie?
- I'm in here!

816
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,887
Raise me to your lips

817
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,765
Two undernourished egos,
four rotating hips

818
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,101
Hold on to me tightly,
I'm a sliding scale...

819
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,354
How you doin'? Want a beer?

820
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,815
Sure.

821
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,155
Check these out.
Looks like they're getting better.

822
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,449
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

823
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,202
Really good.

824
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,372
You'll be able to get
these stitches out soon.

825
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,292
That's great. Let me see your forehead.

826
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:56,171
Mm-hmm. Right.

827
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,381
- Does this... does this hurt?
- It's good.

828
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,551
Right, you'll...

829
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,470
Between us is our kitchen

830
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:07,347
Where she found my irritants itching

831
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,018
Been here before

832
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:12,895
Been here forever

833
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:17,149
Moving up slowly, inertia keeps

834
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,985
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps

835
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,905
Moving up slowly, inertia keeps

836
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:26,909
Moving up slowly,
she comes moving up slowly...

837
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,869
Why did you paint over the wall?

838
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,664
Well, I got bored and I got sick
of looking at that thing.

839
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,336
Inertia creeps, moving up slowly...

840
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:50,099
There be no sound in my eiderdown

841
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:53,019
Awake I lie in the morning's bloom

842
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:56,230
Hold me still, my antenna in you

843
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,527
Nylon burns the bedspread with two

844
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,238
Gravity zero, see me stall

845
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,199
I bounce off walls,
lose my footing and fall

846
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,828
Can be sweet though incomplete,
though...

847
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:13,872
I really wish you weren't
wearing that uniform right now.

848
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,542
It's got nothing to do
with the uniform, believe me.

849
01:13:16,641 --> 01:13:17,752
Well, what is it, your vow?

850
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,338
You took a vow to be dead
from the neck down?

851
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,800
Come on.

852
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,885
I've seen the way you look at me.

853
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:28,930
You know the way that I feel about you.

854
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,349
Come on, I'm not blind. It's okay.

855
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,684
It's okay.

856
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,519
No.

857
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,895
Why? Because I...
I painted the wall out?

858
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,399
Is that it?
So now I'm no use to you, right?

859
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:40,692
Is that it?

860
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,610
Answer me!

861
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:47,323
You are so proud
of your holy abstinence!

862
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,703
Like touching a woman would kill you!

863
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:56,166
Women are dirty little complications!

864
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,296
That's why you became a priest!

865
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:05,259
It has nothing to do
with your convenient little stories!

866
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:16,770
Oh, you're so proud of your church,
of virgins and eunuchs!

867
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,344
How's your faith these days, Father?

868
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:52,555
How's your faith these days?

869
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:56,518
This is what you fucking call God?

870
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,189
Blood of Christ!

871
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,845
I've never seen you pray before.

872
01:18:19,944 --> 01:18:22,515
I haven't prayed for a very long time.

873
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,603
Come here.

874
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,564
It's okay. Come on.

875
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,838
Go in.

876
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,479
Daniel.

877
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:54,315
We've come to help.

878
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,612
Take her to the archdiocese
straightaway.

879
01:20:18,521 --> 01:20:20,591
I'll be downstairs
if you need me, Sister.

880
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,600
Where did you get this from, hmm?
What does it mean?

881
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:32,603
The girl wrote it.
I don't know what it means.

882
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,939
Neither does she.

883
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:39,109
Why was it painted over?
What language is it in?

884
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,360
It's Aramaic.

885
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:41,945
How do you know that?

886
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,489
That's completely irrelevant.

887
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,702
See, what I don't understand
is why you would send this

888
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,578
to anyone other than me.

889
01:20:49,677 --> 01:20:50,996
What are you hiding from me, Andrew?

890
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:54,582
Look, all I know is that the girl
is fighting for her life.

891
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:58,170
If she receives another wound,
she's going to die unless we help her.

892
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,047
Right. I'm taking over this case.
Go back to Father Durning's.

893
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,134
- Get some rest.
- I'm not leaving her alone.

894
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:04,592
You're not leaving her alone.

895
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,261
You're leaving her
in the care of the sisters.

896
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,764
Look, you sent me here.
I didn't want to come.

897
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:11,559
You told me to deal with her!
That's what I'm doing!

898
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,935
She's in no condition
to take on you or the Church.

899
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:17,689
This is not about a girl taking on me
or taking on the Church!

900
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,067
Why are you so concerned
about those photographs?

901
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,069
Why is that more important
than a girl bleeding to death?

902
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,988
Andrew, what's happened to you?
Where's your loyalty?

903
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:26,364
Don't you lecture me
about loyalty, Daniel.

904
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:29,702
The only reason you've been tolerated
by the congregation for so long

905
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,204
is because you were a good scientist,
because of your objectivity.

906
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:34,873
But you've lost that.

907
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:38,335
The last thing I expected to see
when I walked into that girl's apartment

908
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,337
was the two of you
lying on a bed together.

909
01:21:40,436 --> 01:21:41,546
Oh, come on.

910
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,841
Look, I know you think
you're helping her, but you're not.

911
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,719
If anything, she's getting worse.

912
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:49,430
Andrew, you're in no state
to help anyone right now.

913
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:50,805
You're exhausted. Look at you.

914
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:53,141
Go to Father Durning's. Get some rest.

915
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,769
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

916
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,938
Why are you so concerned
with these photographs?

917
01:21:58,037 --> 01:21:59,564
Father Delmonico showed them to us.

918
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:01,317
He seemed to think they were important.

919
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,525
What do they mean?

920
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,694
We've no idea, but we're working on it.

921
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,323
Does it have anything to do
with the Gospel Commission?

922
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,868
We don't know. Good night, Andrew.

923
01:22:41,497 --> 01:22:43,193
Andrew Kiernan?

924
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:48,154
- I'm Kiernan.
- I want to see Alameida.

925
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,032
I don't know any Alameida.

926
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:54,286
Delmonico faxed me
this copy of his document.

927
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,747
A girl wrote this.
I saw her do it. What is this?

928
01:22:56,846 --> 01:23:02,002
It's maybe the most significant
Christian relic ever found.

929
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:03,295
Why?

930
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:06,465
It's an Aramaic scroll
from the first century

931
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:09,385
discovered near the caves
of the Dead Sea Scrolls

932
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:11,511
outside Jerusalem.

933
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:16,975
Alameida and I concluded
that it is a gospel

934
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:22,021
of Jesus Christ
in his own words, Aramaic.

935
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,440
But there are some factions
in the Vatican

936
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,569
who believe that this document
could destroy

937
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,779
the authority of the modern Church.

938
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,615
How?

939
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,872
It was Jesus' words to his disciples
on the night of his last supper,

940
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,873
his instructions to them

941
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:43,752
on how to continue his church
after his death.

942
01:23:43,851 --> 01:23:46,713
Why would that be so... so threatening?

943
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:50,466
When we gave our initial conclusions
to the Gospel Commission,

944
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:53,261
Houseman ordered us
to stop our work immediately.

945
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,431
Alameida refused.
He stole the document and disappeared.

946
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,726
Houseman excommunicated us
in our absence.

947
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:01,645
You have no idea where he is?

948
01:24:01,744 --> 01:24:06,692
He doesn't want to be caught
until he finishes the translation.

949
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:10,570
I'll show you this guy.
That's Delmonico, me, and Alameida.

950
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,823
We were all translating
the new gospel together.

951
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:16,368
I've seen this man.
Three weeks ago in Brazil.

952
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:19,246
- Yeah?
- He's dead.

953
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:20,497
How do you know this?

954
01:24:20,596 --> 01:24:23,417
Because I saw him in his coffin
in a church in Belo Quinto.

955
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:24,960
I'm sorry.

956
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,634
Then it's all over. It's gone forever.

957
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,386
Why was your work stopped?

958
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,180
What was so threatening
about this gospel?

959
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,432
Look around you, Father.
What do you see?

960
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:42,560
- I see a church.
- It's a building.

961
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:46,481
The true church of Jesus Christ
is so much more,

962
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:49,318
not in buildings made of wood and stone.

963
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,904
I love Jesus.

964
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:54,573
I don't need an institution
between him and me.

965
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:57,033
You see? Just God and man.

966
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:59,243
No priests, no churches.

967
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,456
The first words in Jesus' gospel are,

968
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:07,336
"The kingdom of God is inside you

969
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,337
and all around you,

970
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,591
not in buildings of wood and stone.

971
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,886
'Split a piece of wood, and I'm there.

972
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:18,012
Lift a stone and"'...

973
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,015
"'You will find me."'

974
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:21,350
Yes, Father.

975
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:28,148
Why is Father Alameida wearing gloves?

976
01:25:28,247 --> 01:25:30,567
Alameida was a tormented man.

977
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:33,945
Holy man. A very holy man.

978
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:37,867
He wore the gloves to cover
the marks of the stigmata.

979
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,289
She has the stigmata.

980
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,417
That's why.

981
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,588
She's just his messenger.

982
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,385
Houseman will never let
this gospel get out.

983
01:25:57,444 --> 01:26:00,805
Almighty God, bless Your humble servant.

984
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:03,725
Guide me with Your Holy Spirit
and forgive me,

985
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:07,479
for I have sinned exceedingly
in thought, word, and deed.

986
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,085
My sins deserve Your punishments

987
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:34,756
because they have crucified
my loving savior, Jesus Christ, amen.

988
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:10,583
Lord, do not remember our sins
or those of our forefathers.

989
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:13,337
- Where's Andrew?
- And do not punish us for our offences.

990
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:16,215
- Lead us not into temptation.
- But deliver us from evil.

991
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,550
Save this woman, your servant.

992
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:21,345
Spirit of lust,
by the power of Jesus Christ,

993
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:24,722
I command you, come out of her body
now and for always.

994
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:28,143
In the name... in the name
of Jesus Christ, I command you,

995
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,020
come out of her body now and for always.

996
01:27:31,537 --> 01:27:32,814
In the name of Jesus Christ...

997
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:40,238
Be a tower of strength to her, O Lord!

998
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:43,283
Why do you persecute me?

999
01:27:43,382 --> 01:27:45,452
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord!

1000
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:49,914
Give her heavenly protection!

1001
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:53,127
Lord, hear my prayer!
Let the enemy have no victory over...

1002
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,170
Behold!

1003
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,466
Your servant, dripping with blood!

1004
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,306
Embrace me, my child. I am the Church!

1005
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:10,644
- I'm the Church.
- Stop! Stop!

1006
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:13,109
No! Get away from me!

1007
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:17,734
Get them out of here!
Get out of here! Get out!

1008
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:19,612
- Eminenza.
- Get out!

1009
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:24,408
Save this woman from woe, O Lord!

1010
01:28:24,507 --> 01:28:27,085
Save this woman, your servant!

1011
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,252
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord.

1012
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:37,712
Give her heavenly protection.

1013
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:44,845
Save this woman, O Lord!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

1014
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:52,394
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord.

1015
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:57,815
Frankie!

1016
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:01,279
You will not destroy my Church.

1017
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,538
Frankie!

1018
01:29:12,596 --> 01:29:14,542
You must not interrupt...

1019
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:18,587
What are you doing? Get away from her!

1020
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,881
- Get away from her!
- No! No!

1021
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,507
Get away!

1022
01:29:24,564 --> 01:29:26,636
It's all right. It's okay.

1023
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:28,764
- I know what...
- Andrew!

1024
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,140
Get away from her!
You don't know what's going on here!

1025
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,060
You get off me! You lied to me!

1026
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:38,523
You tried to silence her.
You lied to me, you bastard.

1027
01:29:38,622 --> 01:29:41,150
- Andrew...
- You tried to kill her!

1028
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:42,444
No!

1029
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,820
Listen! I know everything.

1030
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,198
I know why you closed down
the Gospel Commission.

1031
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:50,827
I know why you had Petrocelli
and Alameida excommunicated.

1032
01:29:50,926 --> 01:29:53,412
I know all about the lies
you've been telling for years.

1033
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:55,832
There is no way you'll get away
with what you did to her!

1034
01:29:55,931 --> 01:29:58,168
I will not let you destroy the Church.

1035
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:03,798
I promise you, you've spent
your last days in the Church.

1036
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:19,856
Are you Paolo Alameida?

1037
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,827
Give me your wisdom.
Let me be your messenger.

1038
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:36,206
A messenger believes.

1039
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:39,377
A messenger has faith.
You have only doubt.

1040
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:06,653
Jesus said, "The kingdom
of God is inside you

1041
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:11,449
and all around you,
not in mansions of wood and stone.

1042
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:14,453
Split a piece of wood, and I am there.

1043
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:18,416
Lift a stone... and you will find me."

1044
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:25,796
Brother Alameida,
I call upon you to release this woman.

1045
01:31:25,896 --> 01:31:29,311
Give her grace and let her not come
into the ways of harm.

1046
01:31:29,412 --> 01:31:31,595
Through Jesus Christ,
we have all been saved.

1047
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:34,014
Let us not fear any ill,

1048
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,850
for Jesus is with us
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

1049
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:39,685
world without end, forever and ever.

1050
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:44,940
God bless your soul, Brother Alameida.

1051
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:48,819
And go in peace.

1052
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,261
Don't go, Frankie.

1053
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:05,523
Stay with me.

1054
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:09,354
Jesus said, "The kingdom
of God is inside you

1055
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:14,149
and all around you,
not in mansions of wood and stone."

1056
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:18,070
The kingdom of God is inside you
and all around you,

1057
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:20,657
not in buildings of wood and stone.

1058
01:35:20,756 --> 01:35:23,076
Split a piece of wood, and I am there."

1059
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:26,496
These are the hidden sayings
that the living Jesus spoke.

1060
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:31,710
Whoever discovers the meaning
of these sayings will not taste death.

1061
01:36:29,908 --> 01:36:34,398
Your eyes, they send me

1062
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:41,279
To eternity

1063
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:46,951
Your heart may cast me

1064
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:52,832
Down to hell

1065
01:36:52,931 --> 01:36:56,336
I'm bound

1066
01:36:56,435 --> 01:36:59,005
But lately

1067
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:02,091
It's your love

1068
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:08,681
It's condemnation enough

1069
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:16,855
Identify

1070
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:22,570
Please identify

1071
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:26,408
If it's me you want

1072
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:29,868
Standing by your side

1073
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:36,251
Identify

1074
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:42,881
These tears of mine

1075
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:45,719
Am I lonely

1076
01:37:45,819 --> 01:37:50,056
Or am I just alive?

1077
01:37:55,744 --> 01:38:01,192
I let time decide

1078
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:06,698
Who and what will stand this test

1079
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:09,533
Of love

1080
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:13,787
Your hands were speaking

1081
01:38:13,887 --> 01:38:15,957
No

1082
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:20,170
I felt the movement

1083
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:22,588
Go

1084
01:38:22,689 --> 01:38:26,384
The ice was breaking

1085
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:33,099
So I wonder why

1086
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:36,603
Did I

1087
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:43,777
Identify

1088
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:49,823
With you, my life?

1089
01:38:49,923 --> 01:38:52,993
To leave me empty

1090
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:59,417
And see if I'd survive?

1091
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:39,666
For every questioned hour

1092
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:46,256
For every second devoured

1093
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:51,594
You let me wander you

1094
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:56,724
Into a myth

1095
01:39:56,823 --> 01:40:01,270
That I live

1096
01:40:01,371 --> 01:40:07,569
Identify

1097
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:14,033
Please identify

1098
01:40:14,132 --> 01:40:17,119
If it's me you want

1099
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,539
Standing by your side

1100
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:26,753
Identify

1101
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:33,094
These tears of mine

1102
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:36,430
Am I lonely

1103
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:42,229
Or am I just alive?

1104
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:45,856
Am I lonely

1105
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:51,029
Or am I just alive?
