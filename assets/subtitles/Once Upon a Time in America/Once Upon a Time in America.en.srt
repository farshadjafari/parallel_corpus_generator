If it's kid stuff, why not have
the kids from Detroit do it?

Excuse me, Noodles. He means that
it's something that's very simple.

670

from outside to handle it.

these diamonds to Holland

672
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:56,253

came up right away.

He conned me into every policy
in the world. Every policy, name it.

night, he comes in with his wife...

who works for a jeweler.

And he's still on the hustle,
this guy.

687
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:59,469
So I wink at the guys,
I say, "Look...

...the most serious policy,
you don't have me covered for."

689
01:55:05,625 --> 01:55:09,675

"Cock insurance."

"You make me a policy that when
it don't work, I get a payment...

getting it up the ass.

Sooner than you think.

864
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:44,050
Chief Aiello, moving policemen
into the factory came as a surprise.

865
02:17:44,125 --> 02:17:46,843
The press, the unions,
especially the strikers.

866
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,593
What did you want,
a declaration of war?

867
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:51,502
Ours was a peaceable operation.

868
02:17:51,666 --> 02:17:54,045
REPORTER: Wasn't that contrary
to new union laws?

869
02:17:54,208 --> 02:17:56,426
I'm chief of police,
not chief of people.

870
02:17:56,583 --> 02:17:58,926
Was there any violence to justify...

My motto is:
"Prevention, not repression."

872

You let scabs move in and work.

Young lady, you wanna talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

With your permission,

875
02:18:10,791 --> 02:18:14,251
I'll take these flowers
to my missis before they wilt.

REPORTER:
Chief, one more question.

879
02:18:23,750 --> 02:18:25,673
We heard he's the youngest
stockholder

880
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:28,218
in that factory you occupied.

881
02:18:32,916 --> 02:18:34,885
What'd you mean by that?

882
02:18:35,041 --> 02:18:39,593
They say management expressed their
thanks with a present for the baby.

883
02:18:42,625 --> 02:18:45,253
You know,
slander is a serious offense.

884
02:18:45,416 --> 02:18:47,670
Especially from a hack reporter.

885
02:18:48,166 --> 02:18:50,920
You wanna find out how serious?

886
02:18:53,041 --> 02:18:58,048
But since this is my first boy
after four girls...

887
02:18:58,208 --> 02:19:00,756
...I'll declare amnesty.

- For five.
- For five? Well, why not.

You could feed an army
with these milk plants.

We could open up a dairy.

to change his bed.

just before he died.

1111

your Song of Songs, remember?

How beautiful are your feet
In sandals, O prince's daughter

1114

I used to read the Bible
every night.

1115
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:01,177
Every night
I used to think about you.

1116
02:40:03,416 --> 02:40:08,127
Your navel is a bowl
Well-rounded with no lack of wine

1117
02:40:08,583 --> 02:40:12,166
Your belly, a heap of wheat
Surrounded with lilies

1118

1119
02:40:16,291 --> 02:40:18,761

the way I loved you.

1122
02:40:38,958 --> 02:40:42,461
At times I couldn't stand it.
I used to think about you.

1123
02:40:42,625 --> 02:40:46,709
I'd think, "Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."

03:18:49,375 --> 03:18:53,504
I like it when you come home
late and wake me up.

1365
03:18:59,083 --> 03:19:01,301
I'm not gonna be home tonight.

1366
03:19:08,291 --> 03:19:10,841
I'm not gonna be home tomorrow
either.

1367
03:19:11,291 --> 03:19:15,251
I thought these things
only take a couple of hours.

1368
03:19:21,625 --> 03:19:27,552
Ladies and gents, I drink to
the demise of Fat Moe's speakeasy.

1369
03:19:27,833 --> 03:19:32,134
Who the hell wants to drink
here legally anyway, am I right?

1370
03:19:32,625 --> 03:19:36,129
Okay. Come on, Moe, set them up.
Go on, get in there.

1371
03:19:51,125 --> 03:19:53,378
MAX:
Here's mud in your eye.

1372
03:20:00,041 --> 03:20:01,543
Boys.

1373
03:20:04,916 --> 03:20:07,045
Let's drink to our last shipment.

1374
03:20:07,208 --> 03:20:10,051
There's more onboard
tonight than just booze.

1375
03:20:10,208 --> 03:20:15,635
It's 10 years of our lives. Ten
years that were really worth living.

1376
03:20:15,791 --> 03:20:17,168
Yeah.

1377
03:20:35,625 --> 03:20:37,468
MAX: Noodles.

1378
03:20:38,833 --> 03:20:40,425
Noodles.

1379
03:20:42,125 --> 03:20:44,718
- L'Chaim.
- L'Chaim.

1380
03:20:47,708 --> 03:20:50,301
How long will I have to wait?

1381
03:20:53,958 --> 03:20:57,461
A year and a half, more or less.

1382
03:20:58,833 --> 03:21:01,005
Six months off for good behavior.

1383
03:21:01,458 --> 03:21:04,301
- What are you gonna do?
NOODLES: Don't ask.

1384
03:22:38,958 --> 03:22:40,800
FEMALE OPERATOR: Operator.

1385
03:22:42,125 --> 03:22:43,297
Police, please.

1386
03:22:43,791 --> 03:22:45,668
(RINGS)

1387
03:22:49,291 --> 03:22:51,545
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.

1388
03:22:54,291 --> 03:22:55,838
Hello.

1389
03:22:56,791 --> 03:22:59,875
Who's speaking? Can I help you?

1390
03:23:00,041 --> 03:23:02,043
- Hello.
- Yeah.

1391
03:23:04,625 --> 03:23:06,377
I got a good tip for you.

1392
03:23:32,833 --> 03:23:36,632
NOODLES: Yeah, who is it?
MAX: It's Max. Open the door.

1393
03:23:42,500 --> 03:23:46,549
- What's the matter with you?
You sick? -No, I'm fine.

1394
03:23:46,708 --> 03:23:48,380
MAX: You don't look it.

1395
03:23:50,500 --> 03:23:53,343
Maybe you'd better stay home
tonight, huh?

1396
03:23:53,833 --> 03:23:56,756
- Why?
- Huh.

1397
03:23:59,208 --> 03:24:02,131
You know, I've been watching you
all night.

1398
03:24:03,625 --> 03:24:06,468
And you've been drinking
like a fish.

1399
03:24:07,333 --> 03:24:09,755
Trying to get your courage up?

1400
03:24:13,250 --> 03:24:16,549
We're only bringing
in a shipment of booze.

1401
03:24:18,083 --> 03:24:21,291
It's got so you're even scared
to do that.

1402
03:24:23,041 --> 03:24:25,795
Maybe you just better
stay home tonight.

1403
03:24:26,833 --> 03:24:28,379
With Eve.

1404
03:24:38,708 --> 03:24:43,134
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you go,
I go too. Remember that.

1405
03:24:52,958 --> 03:24:55,426
Maybe Sharkey was right.

1406
03:24:55,583 --> 03:24:58,381
Maybe I ought to just dump you.

1407
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:11,129
- You're really crazy.
- Never say that.

1408
03:25:11,625 --> 03:25:14,799
Don't say it!

1409
03:25:21,666 --> 03:25:25,752
CAROL: Max made fools of us,
Noodles. He wanted to die.

1410
03:25:25,916 --> 03:25:28,966
Did you know his old man died
in the nut house?

1411
03:25:29,125 --> 03:25:31,968
Max didn't want to end up
the same way.

1412
03:25:32,166 --> 03:25:36,297
So he put the idea
in our heads to tip off the cops.

1413
03:25:36,458 --> 03:25:41,338
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first

1414
03:25:41,500 --> 03:25:44,799
just to get himself killed.

1415
03:26:01,958 --> 03:26:04,301
What is this?

1416
03:26:07,333 --> 03:26:08,504
Opening night.

1417
03:26:10,166 --> 03:26:12,841
Fifteen years ago.

1418
03:26:13,291 --> 03:26:15,293
Who's this?

1419
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:20,004
Patron saint of the place.

1420
03:26:21,375 --> 03:26:23,628
And some actress.

1421
03:26:24,416 --> 03:26:25,793
Do you know her?

1422
03:26:27,791 --> 03:26:29,338
No.

1423
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:00,093
This proves me base:

1424
03:27:01,458 --> 03:27:04,336
If she first meet the curled Antony,
he'll make demand of her,

1425
03:27:04,416 --> 03:27:07,626
and spend that kiss
which is my heaven to have.

1426
03:27:30,958 --> 03:27:33,301
Come, thou mortal wretch,

1427
03:27:35,958 --> 03:27:40,634
with thy sharp teeth this knot
intrinsicate of life at once untie:

1428
03:27:43,291 --> 03:27:45,511
poor venomous fool.

1429
03:27:47,833 --> 03:27:50,881
Be angry, and dispatch.

1430
03:27:53,666 --> 03:27:56,511
Oh, couldst thou speak,

1431
03:27:57,416 --> 03:28:01,718
that I might hear thee call
great Caesar ass unpolicied!

1432
03:28:01,791 --> 03:28:04,591
Oh eastern star! Peace, peace!

1433
03:28:04,666 --> 03:28:07,045
Dost thou not see my baby
at my breast,

1434
03:28:07,125 --> 03:28:10,709
that sucks the nurse asleep?
Oh, break! Oh, break!

1435
03:28:10,791 --> 03:28:12,920
As sweet as balm,

1436
03:28:13,583 --> 03:28:17,462
as soft as air, as gentle...

1437
03:28:19,166 --> 03:28:21,090
Oh, Antony!

1438
03:28:29,291 --> 03:28:31,420
Nay, I will take thee too.

1439
03:28:39,208 --> 03:28:41,505
What should I stay...

1440
03:28:41,583 --> 03:28:44,916
In this vile world?
So, fare thee well.

1441
03:28:46,041 --> 03:28:50,968
Now boast thee, death, in thy
possession lies a lass unparallel'd.

1442
03:28:51,041 --> 03:28:53,170
Downy windows, close,

1443
03:28:53,250 --> 03:28:57,675
and golden Phoebus never be beheld
of eyes again so royal!

1444
03:28:57,750 --> 03:29:01,129
Your crown's awry.
I'll mend it, and then play.

1445
03:29:38,750 --> 03:29:41,048
Hello, Deborah.

1446
03:29:48,625 --> 03:29:51,299
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1447
03:29:58,041 --> 03:30:01,376
What is someone
supposed to say after...

1448
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:05,049
...more than 30 years.

1449
03:30:10,166 --> 03:30:15,378
Well, how about, "How you doing?
You're looking good." Or...

1450
03:30:18,125 --> 03:30:21,299
"I was hoping
I'd never see you again."

1451
03:30:23,708 --> 03:30:26,711
I never thought I would.

1452
03:30:27,791 --> 03:30:30,136
There's a difference.

1453
03:30:30,833 --> 03:30:33,210
At least you recognized me,
that's something.

1454
03:30:33,291 --> 03:30:37,126
Actresses have good memories.

1455
03:30:46,875 --> 03:30:49,218
You want a drink?

1456
03:30:53,416 --> 03:30:55,840
I'm having one.

1457
03:31:06,250 --> 03:31:07,297
Margo.

1458
03:31:09,041 --> 03:31:11,761
- Yes, miss?
DEBORAH: That's all. You can go.

1459
03:31:11,916 --> 03:31:14,136
All right, miss.

1460
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:21,879
She called you "miss."

1461
03:31:22,208 --> 03:31:24,630
You never got married?

1462
03:31:25,458 --> 03:31:27,084
No.

1463
03:31:30,666 --> 03:31:32,213
You live alone?

1464
03:31:40,333 --> 03:31:41,834
No.

1465
03:31:48,666 --> 03:31:51,011
Where were you?

1466
03:31:53,916 --> 03:31:56,340
I was out of town.

1467
03:31:59,166 --> 03:32:01,966
Have you been back long?

1468
03:32:02,916 --> 03:32:05,340
A couple of days.

1469
03:32:05,500 --> 03:32:07,753
Are you staying?

1470
03:32:19,375 --> 03:32:20,797
That depends.

1471
03:32:23,708 --> 03:32:25,801
Why do you want to see me?

1472
03:32:27,625 --> 03:32:29,968
Two reasons.

1473
03:32:30,125 --> 03:32:33,299
First, I wanted to see
if you did the right thing,

1474
03:32:33,375 --> 03:32:35,468
turning me down
to become an actress.

1475
03:32:39,791 --> 03:32:41,385
Well?

1476
03:32:44,041 --> 03:32:46,465
You did. You're terrific.

1477
03:33:02,041 --> 03:33:05,125
"Age cannot wither her."

1478
03:33:05,333 --> 03:33:08,336
It's like the play
was written for you.

1479
03:33:11,791 --> 03:33:14,261
What was the other reason?

1480
03:33:14,458 --> 03:33:16,755
The other reason...

1481
03:33:19,958 --> 03:33:24,292
...is to decide whether I should go
to a party tomorrow night.

1482
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:32,547
Party?

1483
03:33:35,833 --> 03:33:38,335
Yeah, on Long Island.

1484
03:33:39,833 --> 03:33:43,006
A Secretary Bailey.

1485
03:33:46,833 --> 03:33:49,005
Do you know Secretary Bailey?

1486
03:33:50,833 --> 03:33:52,049
No.

1487
03:33:54,458 --> 03:33:56,801
But I was invited anyway.

1488
03:34:05,291 --> 03:34:08,171
If you don't know each other,
why were you invited?

1489
03:34:08,333 --> 03:34:09,879
I don't know.

1490
03:34:11,500 --> 03:34:13,548
I thought you might know why.

1491
03:34:14,583 --> 03:34:15,959
Me?

1492
03:34:16,166 --> 03:34:17,793
Why me?

1493
03:34:23,208 --> 03:34:25,130
Because you know him.

1494
03:34:25,291 --> 03:34:26,417
(KNOCKING)

1495
03:34:26,583 --> 03:34:28,050
DEBORAH: Who is it?
DAVID: David.

1496
03:34:28,208 --> 03:34:30,881
- No, David.
DAVID: Can I come in?

1497
03:34:31,083 --> 03:34:33,926
No. Just wait outside,
I'll call you.

1498
03:34:34,125 --> 03:34:36,503
Okay, I'll be right here.

1499
03:34:39,291 --> 03:34:43,092
- What does Bailey want from me?
- You came to ask me that?

1500
03:34:43,291 --> 03:34:46,262
- Why'd he send me an invitation?
- I don't know.

1501
03:34:46,458 --> 03:34:50,792
Why should I know about your
invitations? I don't know anything.

1502
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:55,004
What do you want? Why did you come
here? I know nothing.

1503
03:34:55,166 --> 03:34:57,841
Now you're a lousy actress.

1504
03:35:00,666 --> 03:35:03,511
Who is Secretary Bailey?

1505
03:35:12,250 --> 03:35:15,879
Secretary Bailey
is a rich businessman.

1506
03:35:21,583 --> 03:35:26,167
He came to the United States as an
immigrant and made a lot of money...

1507
03:35:26,375 --> 03:35:30,334
...in San Francisco and L.A.,
where he's lived for 30 years.

1508
03:35:30,500 --> 03:35:34,504
NOODLES: I know all that. It's all
in the papers. What else is there?

1509
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:44,004
He married a very wealthy woman.

1510
03:35:45,291 --> 03:35:47,636
They had a child.

1511
03:35:48,000 --> 03:35:51,049
She died when the child was born.

1512
03:35:51,625 --> 03:35:56,175
A few years ago, he went
into politics. Moved here.

1513
03:35:56,333 --> 03:36:00,963
That's history. I'm not talking
about that. I'm talking about now.

1514
03:36:01,541 --> 03:36:04,170
Right now he's in trouble.

1515
03:36:05,833 --> 03:36:09,291
Just tell me you've been living
with him all these years,

1516
03:36:09,375 --> 03:36:11,343
and you're his lover.

1517
03:36:20,166 --> 03:36:23,171
DEBORAH:
Age can wither me, Noodles.

1518
03:36:26,875 --> 03:36:29,503
We're both getting old.

1519
03:36:34,833 --> 03:36:38,132
All that we have left now
are our memories.

1520
03:36:41,041 --> 03:36:47,004
If you go to that party on Saturday
night, you won't have those anymore.

1521
03:36:48,375 --> 03:36:50,843
Tear up that invitation.

1522
03:36:53,208 --> 03:36:55,835
There's an exit back this way.

1523
03:36:56,750 --> 03:36:59,674
Noodles, go through it.

1524
03:37:02,333 --> 03:37:04,209
Keep walking.

1525
03:37:04,416 --> 03:37:06,670
Don't turn around.

1526
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:10,128
Please, Noodles.

1527
03:37:10,333 --> 03:37:13,336
I'm begging you. Please.

1528
03:37:19,791 --> 03:37:23,342
Are you afraid that I'll turn
into a pillar of salt?

1529
03:37:26,833 --> 03:37:30,587
If you go out that door, yes.

1530
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:31,719
DEBORAH:
This is Secretary Bailey's son.

1531
03:38:31,916 --> 03:38:35,421
His name's David, just like yours.

1532
03:41:07,708 --> 03:41:12,668
I must admit this party was
a wonderful idea, Mr. Secretary.

1533
03:41:13,375 --> 03:41:17,004
It's a bit like saying, "I'm going
up before the Commettee in 5 days,

1534
03:41:17,083 --> 03:41:19,176
like, my conscience is clear.

1535
03:41:19,708 --> 03:41:23,132
The most important people
in New York are my guests.

1536
03:41:23,833 --> 03:41:27,041
It's going to be a night
to remember."

1537
03:41:27,125 --> 03:41:29,298
Especially if the house blows up.

1538
03:41:30,166 --> 03:41:32,295
Where are you putting the next bomb?

1539
03:41:33,791 --> 03:41:35,543
In the freezer?

1540
03:41:36,541 --> 03:41:38,465
Or in the toilet?

1541
03:41:46,541 --> 03:41:49,512
You can't even think straight
anymore.

1542
03:41:50,625 --> 03:41:52,923
I'll tell you something.

1543
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:57,755
A waiting list of people would like
to send flowers to your funeral.

1544
03:41:59,916 --> 03:42:03,626
- I can point out ten right now,
if you like me to. -Yes.

1545
03:42:03,708 --> 03:42:06,756
But none of them wants to read my
obituary in front of the Committee

1546
03:42:06,833 --> 03:42:08,834
as much as you do.

1547
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:10,798
You and your union.

1548
03:42:14,250 --> 03:42:17,093
We just want to resolve
this situation clean.

1549
03:42:17,166 --> 03:42:20,797
I've heard that same song from you
for 35 fucking years!

1550
03:42:20,875 --> 03:42:23,253
Who do you think you are talking to?

1551
03:42:24,916 --> 03:42:28,626
I helped you to make a fortune,
you and the rest of those parasites!

1552
03:42:28,708 --> 03:42:33,292
It was a reasonable arrangement
between labour and management.

1553
03:42:34,708 --> 03:42:38,041
2% for them and 40% for you.

1554
03:42:38,541 --> 03:42:41,546
You defend them and you screw them.
Come on!

1555
03:42:42,291 --> 03:42:44,511
It's been the story of your life.

1556
03:42:45,500 --> 03:42:48,754
- Do you think anybody believe you
anymore? -Some.

1557
03:42:49,791 --> 03:42:52,386
But no one believes in you anymore,

1558
03:42:52,458 --> 03:42:55,506
because you have made mistakes
and I haven't.

1559
03:42:56,875 --> 03:42:59,549
But that's beside the point.

1560
03:43:01,375 --> 03:43:04,254
The important thing right now
is that

1561
03:43:04,333 --> 03:43:07,632
you and I straighten out
these transfers of authority.

1562
03:43:10,041 --> 03:43:12,386
Now it's all as we have agreed.

1563
03:43:15,666 --> 03:43:18,216
Have had our lawyers drawn it up.

1564
03:43:20,250 --> 03:43:22,548
All you have to do is sign.

1565
03:43:30,833 --> 03:43:32,755
My last will?

1566
03:43:34,375 --> 03:43:37,128
You are not in a position
to exercise your will.

1567
03:43:39,750 --> 03:43:42,048
I give up everything.

1568
03:43:43,833 --> 03:43:46,676
12% would be set aside for your boy.

1569
03:43:46,750 --> 03:43:51,084
In that way he can be assured
of living to a ripe old age.

1570
03:43:52,166 --> 03:43:54,966
Or not, if I don't sign?

1571
03:45:05,541 --> 03:45:08,386
Why don't you take care of this
by yourself?

1572
03:45:09,791 --> 03:45:13,251
I'd be very happy for you tonight,
if during all the noise of the party

1573
03:45:13,333 --> 03:45:16,336
- I heard a shot.
- Maybe you will.

I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

1578
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:22,093
Sit down, Noodles.

1579
03:47:26,333 --> 03:47:28,130
Make yourself comfortable.

1580
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:49,218
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

desert a sinking ship.

But in my case, they appear to be
flocking onboard.

1585
03:48:17,541 --> 03:48:21,376
Yeah, well, I read about
your troubles in the newspapers.

1586
03:48:22,750 --> 03:48:24,627
But a man in your position,

...a certain amount of risk.

1590
03:48:42,458 --> 03:48:45,210
Why'd you ask me
to come here, Mr. Bailey?

1591
03:48:48,541 --> 03:48:53,048
That invitation doesn't mean
a goddamn thing, and you know it.

1592
03:48:53,416 --> 03:48:56,967
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

1593
03:48:58,625 --> 03:49:01,343
The money and the contract.

03:49:04,166 --> 03:49:07,376
It didn't say who the contract
was on, though.

Haven't you figured that out yet?

You, Mr. Bailey?

1597
03:49:28,166 --> 03:49:31,876
I haven't had a gun in my hand
for many, many years.

1598
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:39,051

- Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

1600

I'm already a dead man.

At least give me the chance to
settle the debt that I owe to you.

1602

I'll never make it before

They're scared I'll implicate
the whole bunch of 'em.

They gotta get rid of me.

Today is as good a day as any.

1606
03:50:14,375 --> 03:50:16,593
You do it, Noodles.

1607
03:50:17,541 --> 03:50:20,921
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

1608
03:50:27,791 --> 03:50:30,386
You see, I found out where you were.

1609
03:50:30,541 --> 03:50:33,625
I brought you back here for this.

1610

To even the score
between you and me.

1611
03:50:40,541 --> 03:50:43,011
You can get out through there.

1612
03:50:50,250 --> 03:50:54,800
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.

1613
03:51:01,541 --> 03:51:05,922
I don't know what you're talking
about. You don't owe me a thing.

1614
03:51:13,875 --> 03:51:18,459
Your eyes were too full of tears
to see it wasn't me burned up

on that street.

1616

It was somebody else.

1617
03:51:24,291 --> 03:51:29,218
You were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too.

1618
03:51:29,833 --> 03:51:33,041
That was a syndicate operation,
Noodles.

1619
03:51:43,333 --> 03:51:45,334
You're crazy.

1620
03:51:47,791 --> 03:51:52,047
You said that to me once before,
a long time ago.

1621
03:51:52,333 --> 03:51:55,791
My mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

1622
03:51:56,541 --> 03:52:00,046
I took away your whole life
from you.

1623
03:52:00,250 --> 03:52:03,093
I've been living in your place.

1624
03:52:04,333 --> 03:52:06,926
I took everything.

1625
03:52:08,333 --> 03:52:10,505
I took your money.

1626
03:52:11,208 --> 03:52:13,335
I took your girl.

1627
03:52:14,041 --> 03:52:18,843
All I left for you was 35 years
of grief over having killed me.

1628
03:52:20,666 --> 03:52:22,465
Now, why don't you shoot?

1629
03:53:57,000 --> 03:53:59,924
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.

1630
03:54:00,125 --> 03:54:04,880
Sometimes to defend myself.
Sometimes for money.

1631
03:54:05,166 --> 03:54:07,716
And many people used to come to us.

1632
03:54:07,916 --> 03:54:10,841
Business partners, rivals...

1633
03:54:11,208 --> 03:54:13,380
...lovers.

1634
03:54:13,750 --> 03:54:17,879
Some of the jobs we took,
and some we didn't.

1635
03:54:31,250 --> 03:54:34,219
Yours is one we would never touch.

1636
03:54:35,083 --> 03:54:38,052
Is this your way of getting revenge?

1637
03:54:42,000 --> 03:54:43,593
No.

1638
03:54:46,916 --> 03:54:50,046
It's just the way I see things.

1639
03:55:52,666 --> 03:55:55,466
It's 10:25...

1640
03:55:56,750 --> 03:55:59,924
...and I've got nothing left
to lose.

1641
03:56:02,041 --> 03:56:06,001
When you've been betrayed
by a friend, you hit back.

1642
03:56:11,041 --> 03:56:12,885
Do it.

1643
03:56:35,000 --> 03:56:37,628
You see, Mr. Secretary...

1644
03:56:39,625 --> 03:56:41,718
...I have a story also.

1645
03:56:42,666 --> 03:56:45,216
A little simpler than yours.

1646
03:56:46,333 --> 03:56:51,042
Many years ago I had a friend,
a dear friend.

1647
03:56:52,666 --> 03:56:55,921
I turned him in to save his life...

1648
03:56:56,125 --> 03:56:58,423
...but he was killed.

1649
03:56:59,708 --> 03:57:02,551
But he wanted it that way.

1650
03:57:03,583 --> 03:57:05,801
It was a great friendship.

1651
03:57:08,875 --> 03:57:12,924
It went bad for him,
and it went bad for me too.

1652
03:57:17,875 --> 03:57:20,048
Good night, Mr. Bailey.

1653
03:57:29,208 --> 03:57:32,916
I hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing.

1654
03:57:34,833 --> 03:57:38,882

a lifetime of work go to waste.
