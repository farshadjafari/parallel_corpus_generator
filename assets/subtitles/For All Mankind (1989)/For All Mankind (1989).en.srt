1
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:28,454
We choose to go to the moon.

2
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:31,354
We choose to go to the moon...

3
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:40,900
We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things,

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,304
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

5
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:48,141
We set sail
on this new sea...

6
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,411
because there is new
knowledge to be gained...

7
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,646
and new rights to be won,

8
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:56,549
and they must be won
and used...

9
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:58,985
for the progress
of all mankind.

10
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,988
We shall send to the moon,

11
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:05,224
240,000 miles away...

12
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:07,827
from the control station
in Houston,

13
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:09,829
a giant rocket...

14
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,831
more than 300 feet tall,

15
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,300
made of new metal alloys,

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,737
some of which have not yet
been invented,

17
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,606
capable of standing heat
and stresses...

18
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:24,177
several times more
than have ever been experienced,

19
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:28,648
fitted together with a precision
better than the finest watch,

20
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:31,717
carrying all the equipment
needed for propulsion,

21
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:36,089
guidance, control,
communications, food and survival,

22
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:38,825
on an untried mission...

23
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:41,494
to an unknown celestial body.

24
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:44,497
And, therefore,
as we set sail,

25
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:47,800
we ask God's blessing
on the most hazardous...

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,971
and dangerous and greatest adventure
on which man has ever embarked.

27
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:53,369
Thank you.

28
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,657
Just like a person
waiting in the wings to go on stage,

29
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:14,260
they probably have less time
to daydream...

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,030
because they're trying to
remember what they've gotta do.

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,900
You know, I had the feeling I really
ought to concentrate on remembering...

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,199
the things that I had to do
at the moon and all that.

33
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:58,502
Gosh, here
we are, and we're getting down close.

34
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:03,173
I hope the suit
checks out okay.

35
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,420
You get sweaty palms...

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,455
and heart starts pounding.

37
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:19,287
It's like the big game
about to start.

38
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:35,041
You're in
your work clothes, ready to go to
work.

39
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,043
But you still
have to stay there.

40
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,812
You have to schedule it in conjunction
with the booster schedule itself.

41
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:44,550
You're plugged into a console
that's supplying 100 % oxygen.

42
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,552
There's kind
of a catch-up time...

43
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:48,554
if there's a problem
with the booster or something,

44
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:51,791
we're there at the pad until the count
gets to a certain point,

45
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,953
and then we're called
to proceed to the spacecraft.

46
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,511
Y'all take care, now.

47
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,000
Godspeed, men.

48
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:55,621
At the last minute, there was
a psychological block there...

49
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:59,925
that said,
"Don't count on this so heavily.

50
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,628
It might not happen."

51
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:06,966
This is such a big thing. I frankly
don't see how you can do it.

52
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:10,970
Even when participating in it, I think
it's audacious that you would
try.

53
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,673
I clearly could never
understand, as a crewman,

54
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:16,342
how to make it work.

55
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:19,606
I could only learn
how to operate my share of it.

56
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,836
Being command pilot, I was
sitting in the center seat,

57
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,872
so that meant
I climbed in last.

58
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:49,101
I just stood around and waited
till they strapped in.

59
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,766
And here was kind
of a strange quiet.

60
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,951
You can look out and you can see
a large part of the state...

61
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:02,888
and the ocean
and this thing out here.

62
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,725
You have the feeling
that it's alive.

63
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:09,228
That's the kind of thing that
sort of, for the first time,

64
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:11,230
begins to bring home the fact...

65
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,359
that today is not the game we've been
playing in training for years.

66
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:19,195
This is reality.

67
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:48,667
I had the only window
at this point,

68
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:53,205
and I looked out, and doggone if the
moon wasn’t visible in the daylight...

69
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,542
right straight out
the top of the window.

70
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,544
I know they're doing their job,
because the moon is right ahead...

71
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,179
and that's where we're pointed.

72
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,341
They're just gonna launch us
right straight to this thing.

73
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,256
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.

74
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:12,258
All still go
on the Apollo mission...

75
00:07:12,258 --> 00:07:16,028
the flight to land
the first men on the moon.

76
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:19,498
The spacecraft also now
is on full internal power.

77
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:24,236
Up to this time, it had been sharing
the load with an external power
source.

78
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:28,808
Once we get down to the three minute
and ten second mark in the countdown,

79
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,810
we'll go on
an automatic sequence.

80
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,213
All aspects from there on down
will be automatic,

81
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:37,272
run by the ground master computer
here in the firing room.

82
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:46,792
We have some 7.6 million pounds
of thrust pushing the vehicle upward,

83
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:52,388
a vehicle that weighs close to
six and a half million pounds.

84
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,569
We all are in this
together as a team effort.

85
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,571
We're gonna make it work.

86
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:00,573
And I don't know
how to make it work.

87
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:03,809
I don't know how to do
most of this mission.

88
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:07,680
But I do know that I can assure you
that my piece of it is gonna work,

89
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,738
and it won't fail
because of me.

90
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:14,687
The members of the launch team
here in the control center...

91
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:18,257
are monitoring a number
of what we call red line values.

92
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:21,494
These are tolerances we don't
want to go above or below...

93
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,496
in temperatures and pressures.

94
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:31,937
They are standing by to call out
any deviations from our plans.

95
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:37,543
The supervisor has informed launch
vehicle testing you are go for launch.

96
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:41,273
Three minutes, 25 seconds and counting.
We are still go at this time.

97
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,084
There's a long period of time...

98
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:48,287
when you've done all the things you can,
and there are few things left to say.

99
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,723
You don't know any new jokes
to tell.

100
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:53,459
There's just not much left
to say except just sit there and wait.

101
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,961
And it feels good.

102
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:59,565
Astronauts report it feels good.
One minute, 25 seconds and counting.

103
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:02,201
Our status board indicates
the third stage completely pressurized.

104
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:05,971
Guidance system goes on internal
at 17 seconds,

105
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:09,074
leading up to the ignition
sequence at 8.9 seconds.

106
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:11,041
Power transfer is complete.

107
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:17,082
Firing command coming in now.

108
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:21,720
We are on the automatic sequence.
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

109
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,491
We're on internal power with
the launch vehicle at this time.

110
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:28,427
All the second stage tanks
now pressurizing.

111
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,429
Thirty-five seconds
and counting.

112
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,299
It won't fail because of me.

113
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,068
T minus 20 seconds and counting.

114
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:37,736
Guidance internal.
15, 14,

115
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,306
13, 12, 11,

116
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:43,075
10, 9, engines on,

117
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:46,178
five, four, three, in two,

118
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:48,338
launch commit.

119
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:07,326
Yahoo!

120
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,987
It feels just like it sounds.

121
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,669
I got a pitch and a roll
program and this baby is really going.

122
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,304
Roger that.
Stand by for mode one bravo.

123
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,203
Mark one bravo.

124
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:26,278
That's a lovely liftoff.
That's not bad at all.

125
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,881
There's a moment
there just of supreme elation,

126
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:31,183
a complete release
of tensions.

127
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,952
To feel all that power
precisely directed,

128
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:37,189
to know that we're on course,
first of all for Earth orbit,

129
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:40,993
and then precisely inserted
onto the right orbit,

130
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,529
the right trajectory,
for rendezvous with the moon.

131
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,432
Apollo, Houston. You're
right smack dab on the trajectory.

132
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:49,101
Your I.U.'s doing
a beautiful job.

133
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:51,103
I got a yaw program.

134
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,272
Trajectory's good. Thrust is good.

135
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:55,274
We're on our way, Houston.

136
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:58,777
At last, I'm leaving the
earth and I'm destined for the moon.

137
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:01,447
What a ride. What a ride.

138
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,710
Roger. We copy, Pete.

139
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,486
Roger. Looks good up here too.

140
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:10,355
Roll's complete.

141
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,425
This is really
a rocking rolling ride.

142
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,761
You can feel it shake.

143
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:18,864
There's a real strong vibration.

144
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,263
Of course, you're up
at the end of this beauty.

145
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,237
Here you are,
going along with the G on ya.

146
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:29,875
It's up to about four Gs, but you're
psyched up, good shape and all that.

147
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,479
Even lifting your arm
to move switches... no problem.

148
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,378
Apollo, you are go for staging.

149
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,251
Here you are coming up on staging,

150
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:42,981
and when staging happens,
it's, like, man!

151
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,694
We got skirt step.

152
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:01,607
And that's for ignition,
Houston.

153
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:04,743
- Thrust is go.
- Roger.

154
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,880
Trajectory, guidance,
C.M.C. Are all go.

155
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,549
Thank you, Joe.

156
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,745
Houston, you're looking
good here, right down the center line.

157
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,103
That was shutdown
right on the money.

158
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,973
17 Houston,
you are go for orbit.

159
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:37,668
And we're out over the Canaries.

160
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:51,156
Apollo, Houston through
the Canaries. How do you read?

161
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:53,350
Loud and clear, Houston.
Over the Canaries.

162
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:57,563
Boy, it's just beautiful
up here looking out the window.

163
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,462
It's just really fantastic.

164
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,802
Roger.

165
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,439
Let me tell ya
a little bit about the ride.

166
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,441
Uh, John, this is Houston.

167
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:13,069
If there's nothing startling to report
about the ride, we'd rather hold off.

168
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:21,286
No, there's nothing really
different to report on the ride.

169
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:23,185
We'll hold off on that.

170
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,958
The sunset is just as
beautiful as always in this business.

171
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:36,735
In Africa, there are
a lot of nomads out in the desert.

172
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:39,938
Clear desert nights, you see
the fires from all of these...

173
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,641
these little yellow dots
that represent the fires...

174
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:45,611
from all these nomads
camping out.

175
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,881
And you realize the broad area
you're looking at.

176
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,483
And each of those little dots
represented people...

177
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,652
other humans that are out there
in an environment...

178
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:58,611
I would consider more strange than
they might think about... me.

179
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,701
When you get there into orbit,

180
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,071
the engines shut down and things
sorta feel sorta funny.

181
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,641
And you sorta unbuckle
your seat belt...

182
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:18,477
and wiggle around in your seat
or tap your toes...

183
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:21,213
and all of a sudden you're just bodies
everywhere in the room...

184
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,113
and you're just doing flips
and can't wheels and spins.

185
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,989
Your first feelings of
weightlessness as it hits
you...

186
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:36,895
is like going down a country
road about 60 miles an hour,

187
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,632
And then you get over the bump, and
you get that good sensation feeling...

188
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,701
and then, boom,
you're back down again.

189
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,203
Only when you're in space
and you go into weightlessness,

190
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:47,602
you go over that bump
and you never come down.

191
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:07,292
Uh, 12 Houston, your program
alarm was an integration problem.

192
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,696
Can you give us a verb 96
to stop your integration...

193
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:13,498
and we'd like you to do
an E mod dump.

194
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:17,569
Give us a 3-2-1 mark
when you do your verb 74,

195
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,571
and if we get it done now,

196
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:22,074
we should have an answer for ya
on your erasable memory...

197
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,309
by the time you get to Guaymas.

198
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:26,208
Do a verb 96 first.

199
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,016
We had a great deal of difficulty...

200
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,916
paying attention
to what our job was.

201
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:39,324
Already I was getting
the impression...

202
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:43,384
that this is such an amazing thing
that I'm gonna forget these things.

203
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,226
I know I'm going to lose this image.
It's going to be replaced with another.

204
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:55,540
Each image came up, was there for
a flash to be appreciated and savored...

205
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,374
and then let go because you know
it's gonna be superposed with others.

206
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:05,605
And, Houston, we're beginning
to see a beautiful sunrise here.

207
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:11,749
Okay. We're giving you a go
for your E.V.A. At this time.

208
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:17,262
Okay.
The hatch is open. No sweat.

209
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,695
Ah, it stayed
just where I wanted it.

210
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:43,751
Dave, come on out
wherever you are.

211
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,635
When you're
outside in one of those spacesuits,

212
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:59,404
you're really in space.

213
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:02,340
There are no boundaries
to what you're seeing.

214
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,843
It's like having a goldfish bowl
over your head...

215
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:07,913
which gives you
unlimited visibility.

216
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:11,950
And then the portable life support
system is just very, very quiet.

217
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,453
You know, there's a water pump in it
that's circulating water...

218
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:17,489
through your underwear...
you know, cooling water.

219
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:22,160
And there's a fan that's pumping the
oxygen through, but they're very quiet.

220
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,059
You can't hear them at all.

221
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:31,596
It's as if you're out there
without anything on.

222
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:39,578
Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Houston.

223
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:43,515
There's a total complete
silence and that beautiful view...

224
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:47,314
and the realization, of course,
that you're going 25,000 miles an hour.

225
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:11,276
You recognize that you're not
there because you deserve to be there.

226
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,278
You were just lucky.

227
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:18,650
You're the representative
of humanity at that point in history...

228
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,746
having that experience,
in a sense, for the rest of mankind.

229
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:30,487
The flight director says get back in.

230
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:40,665
Apollo Control Houston. Two
hours, 25 minutes ground elapsed time.

231
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:48,013
It will be during this pass that we will
have the translunar injection burn.

232
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:50,148
Capcom, we're go for T.L.I.

233
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,018
Roger. Guys, I've got the word
you wanted to hear.

234
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:55,952
You are go for T.L.I.
You're go for the moon.

235
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,960
If there's anything to be
remorseful about on going to the moon,

236
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,497
it was you didn't get to spend as much
time around the earth as you'd like...

237
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,267
because there's an awful lot of
very interesting things to see.

238
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:13,100
Three, two, one, ignition.

239
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:18,076
We confirm ignition,
and the thrust is go.

240
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,779
You guys are really hauling
the mail out of there.

241
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:23,815
Boy, you'd better believe it.
It's like we're climbing straight up.

242
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:27,419
It's a fantastic sight.
Just like we were shot straight up.

243
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,387
Uh, you're going
about 6,000 feet a second.

244
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:46,771
Their present altitude
is now about 3,000 miles,

245
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,976
and the spacecraft moving at
nearly 35,000 feet per second.

246
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:52,978
These three crew members...

247
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:55,844
are traveling faster than
any man has ever flown before.

248
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:00,418
There's not much
sensation of what's really happening...

249
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:03,722
except we're looking at the computer and
the computer is adding up the velocity,

250
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:08,226
and suddenly we really knew
that we were really traveling.

251
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:12,230
And shoot, when that engine lit off,
it was on for a long time.

252
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,232
Shutdown.

253
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,835
But it really hit us when it stopped,

254
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,970
and we turned around
and looked at the earth.

255
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,529
Suddenly,
the earth had started to shrink.

256
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:40,417
Hello, Houston. You'd have
to see this planet to believe it.

257
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:47,632
This is just so you guys
don't get too excited...

258
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:50,168
and forget what your job is
down there.

259
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:52,470
We're ready for what
we're about to receive.

260
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:22,834
Which you could listen to music.

261
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:27,005
We were allowed to carry a personal
cassette so you could play the music.

262
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,564
Mine was country music.

263
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:34,512
Hi, this is Buck Owens
from the Buckaroos.

264
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:38,516
We came down to the studio and thought
we'd put together a little thing...

265
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:41,319
that you could take along
with you on your trip.

266
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,856
Now when you get back, they're probably
gonna put you in the movies,

267
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:46,925
so the first thing
we're gonna do for ya...

268
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:50,295
is to play a little song
called "Act Naturally."

269
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:52,931
It goes like this:

270
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,916
By the way, you know we're making this
tape and they're going to the moon.

271
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,719
They're on their way
to the moon right now. Oh.

272
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:52,524
Hey, anybody up there
read me? This is Houston.

273
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:55,960
You don't think of it
as Texas or the United States.

274
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,797
You really think of it as Earth.

275
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:01,966
The three things that
I associated with Earth...

276
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:06,368
were people and green trees
and fresh water.

277
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:13,044
This is different
for me. My name is Merle Haggard,

278
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:15,079
and this is my band,
the Strangers.

279
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,584
I hope we will be able to do something
you'll enjoy on your way to the moon.

280
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,719
And of course,
we hope that you come back,

281
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:24,622
but we want you to leave
this tape there, okay?

282
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:26,885
We want this tape
to be out of sight.

283
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:15,874
When you get ready to eat,

284
00:25:15,874 --> 00:25:20,178
they'll say right on there, "Command
Module Pilot, day three, meal two."

285
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:23,948
So you take that packet out,

286
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:26,317
and you may have two drinks...

287
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,654
and three or four different
types of food in there.

288
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:33,491
So you've gotta find a spot to stick
these, or they're gonna float off.

289
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,327
And then you've gotta get
the water gun.

290
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,496
You gotta mix up the drinks
and mix up the food...

291
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,598
and knead 'em around...

292
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:43,601
and not let everything
float off in the interim.

293
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,687
The only bad part
about zero gravity in Apollo...

294
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,689
was going to the bathroom.

295
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,392
We had a very crude system.

296
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:09,794
For your feces,
it was a bag,

297
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:12,230
and you'd put this bag
in the right position.

298
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,702
So you go, but nothing goes to
the bottom of the bag in zero gravity.

299
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:21,839
Everything floats. So you've
got this bag and then the problem...

300
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,209
is getting it off
and closing up the bag,

301
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,540
making sure everything's
still in the bag.

302
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,431
Are you still planning to have
TV at the scheduled time?

303
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:50,335
Right. You can go ahead
with the TV now. We're standing by.

304
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:54,138
Hello, Houston. We've got
a beautiful view of the earth here...

305
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:56,674
that is absolutely fantastic.

306
00:26:56,674 --> 00:27:00,745
We're standing by
at this time to receive...

307
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,008
the first TV transmission
from the spacecraft.

308
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:09,320
Houston, we're now
showing you a view of the earth...

309
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,656
through the telephoto lens.

310
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,658
This transmission
is coming to you...

311
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:16,995
approximately halfway
between the moon and the earth.

312
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:21,332
It makes you realize
just what you have back there on Earth.

313
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:25,495
The earth from here is a grand oasis
in the big vastness of space.

314
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:35,847
I keep imagining if I'm some
lonely traveler from another planet,

315
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:39,748
would I land on the blue
or the brown part of the earth?

316
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:46,090
Okay, world.
Hold on to your hat.

317
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,989
I'm gonna turn ya upside down.

318
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:53,631
The spacecraft
at the present time...

319
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:57,568
is in a slow roll as part of the passive
thermal control program...

320
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,467
to maintain temperatures.

321
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,244
You have to,
literally, just pinch yourself...

322
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,513
and ask yourself
the question, silently,

323
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:12,283
"Do you really know where you are
at this point in time and space...

324
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:14,686
and in reality
and in existence?"

325
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:17,288
When you look out the window
and you're looking back...

326
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:19,791
at the most beautiful star
in the heavens...

327
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,793
the most beautiful because
it's the one we understand,

328
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:25,129
and we know it... it's home, humanity,
people, family, love, life.

329
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:27,131
And besides that,
it is beautiful.

330
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:29,801
We can see from pole to pole and
across oceans and continents,

331
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:32,804
and you can watch it turn
and there's not strings holding it up.

332
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:37,365
And it's moving in a blackness
that is almost beyond conception.

333
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:42,747
Rog, how's that tape recorder?

334
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:45,146
Is the R.P.M. Up to nominal?

335
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,986
Yeah. It works
pretty good here in zero G.

336
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:51,453
It works better than it does
down there on the ground.

337
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:00,765
We're ready for the news now.

338
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:02,767
Okay. Let's see.

339
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:06,070
The Beatles have announced
they will no longer perform as a group.

340
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,407
The quartet is reported to have made
in excess of a half billion dollars...

341
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,110
during their short
musical career.

342
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,944
Rumors they will use this money to start
their own space program are false.

343
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:24,322
That's about it for news. A recap
of how the top ten teams did yesterday:

344
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:28,092
Ohio State beat Purdue,
42 to 14,

345
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:31,796
Texas beat T.C.U.,
69 to 7.

346
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:33,865
Tennessee lost to Mississippi.

347
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:37,135
Final score on that one
was 38 to nothing.

348
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:41,139
Notre Dame won over Georgia Tech
last night, 38 to 20.

349
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:45,234
And, of course, Purdue lost
to Ohio State.

350
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,587
When the sunlight shines
through the blackness of space,

351
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,589
it's black,

352
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,959
but I was in sunlight, and I was
able to look at this blackness.

353
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,195
I mean, what are you looking at?

354
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:07,532
Call it the universe, but it's the
infinity of space and time.

355
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:11,469
I'm looking at something
called space, that had no end,

356
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:15,339
and at time,
that has no meaning.

357
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:17,475
You can really focus on it...

358
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:20,645
because you got this planet out there...
this star called Earth...

359
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:23,447
which itself is in this
blackness, but it is lit up...

360
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,783
because the sunlight strikes
on an object...

361
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,819
strikes on something
called Earth.

362
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:30,454
And it's not a hostile blackness.

363
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,890
Maybe it's not hostile because
the beauty of the earth...

364
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,789
that sort of gives it life.

365
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:46,070
Throughout the flight,

366
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,072
the times when one could sit back...

367
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:50,775
and really appreciate what
an amazing adventure this was...

368
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:53,878
was only during those little
periods of time...

369
00:30:53,878 --> 00:30:57,715
when you had a chance to stop and do
the things you weren’t programmed to do.

370
00:30:57,715 --> 00:31:00,818
A lot of times, when there was
nothing else to do...

371
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,888
or after everybody'd gone
to sleep and I couldn't,

372
00:31:03,888 --> 00:31:07,358
I'd open up the window
and look around.

373
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:11,429
One thing every spacecraft
ought to have is a huge window.

374
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:16,100
Looking back at the earth was a pastime
that I never really got tired of.

375
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,336
Uh, who've we got up now?

376
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,439
The other two guys are pretty sleepy.

377
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:24,408
They sacked out again, so
I'm holding the fort down for a while.

378
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:28,746
Biomedical data recently was monitored,

379
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:32,149
and the C.M.P. Was soundly asleep...

380
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:35,019
while the commander was resting...

381
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,154
but perhaps not soundly asleep.

382
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:40,224
We got the black watch
watching you tonight.

383
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:42,593
You picked the midnight shift, I see.

384
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:45,396
Yeah, it's turning out
to be kind of quiet too.

385
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:47,295
We like it that way.

386
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,870
When you're out there
in this little command module,

387
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,007
you see the risk you're taking
because you realize...

388
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:59,143
that, if the glass breaks
or the computers quit working...

389
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:01,679
or the electrical system
quits working,

390
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,115
you're not gonna get back.

391
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:07,351
And you have time to contemplate this.
You have time to think about it.

392
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:12,189
And you have time to run it through
your mind a lot of different times.

393
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:15,893
How far away from Earth now,
Jim... about?

394
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:19,521
It looks like you're
approaching 150,000 miles.

395
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:24,735
Frank, we had a little
eggnog over at Charlie Duke's tonight.

396
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:28,472
Val Anders dropped by. She's looking
fine. Tell Bill she's doing real well.

397
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:30,371
Rog, thank you.

398
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:35,846
Everything that I know...

399
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:39,016
my family and my possessions,

400
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:41,452
my friends, my country.

401
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:44,588
It's all down there
on that little thing,

402
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:49,490
and it's so insignificant
in this great big vastness of space.

403
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,820
Here in Mission Control,
the coffee cup...

404
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,789
has become an appliance...

405
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:06,927
second only to the headset...

406
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:09,486
in usefulness here.

407
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:15,068
Let's, uh, cycle through
some of our consumables...

408
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:18,004
and other items this morning,

409
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:20,073
and I'll tell you what we see.

410
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:22,275
And all this looks quite nominal.

411
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:24,878
Lights, camera, action.

412
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:29,216
We'll show you some of the type
meals that we have on Earth.

413
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:34,054
Matter of fact, on this flight,
we've carried along pieces of bread.

414
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,290
And along with the bread...

415
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,160
we have a ham spread.

416
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,925
And I'll show you, I hope,
how easy it is...

417
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:46,930
to spread some ham...

418
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:53,436
in the environment of zero G.

419
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:26,106
I think we've discovered
that it is quite easy to...

420
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,608
That's great.
You all ought to set this to music.

421
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,610
Oh, you want music?

422
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:37,250
This little tape recorder
has been a big benefit to us...

423
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,254
in passing for the time away
in our transit onto the moon.

424
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:45,859
And it's rather odd to see it
floating like this, in odyssey,

425
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:48,528
while it's playing...

426
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,121
the theme from 2001.

427
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:21,261
- We've lost our picture.
- What the...

428
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:23,396
Okay, Houston.
We've had a problem here.

429
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:25,665
I got three fuel cell lights,
an A.C. Buss light,

430
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:30,403
fuel cell disconnect, A.C. Buss overload
one and two, main buss A and B, out.

431
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,739
This is Houston. Say again, please.

432
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,741
Gang, I don't know what happened here.

433
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:37,072
We had everything in the world
drop out.

434
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:44,751
We are venting something.

435
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:48,188
I don't think
this is gonna be a simple problem.

436
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,323
We have an apparent serious problem...

437
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:54,294
with a leak in the cryogenic
oxygen in the service module...

438
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:57,530
which provides breathing oxygen
for the crew.

439
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,868
Apollo, Houston.
Try S.C.E. To auxiliary, over.

440
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,104
N.C.E. To auxiliary.

441
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:07,334
S.C.E. S.C. E to auxiliary.

442
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,647
Okay. Let's make sure
we don't do anything...

443
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:16,650
that's going to blow our C.S.M.
Electrical power with the batteries...

444
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,016
or that will cause us to lose
fuel cell number two.

445
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:25,225
On panel 276
under instrumentation and power control,

446
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,961
open C.B. Number three
and number four.

447
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:31,398
Close ascent feed one and two
circuit breakers.

448
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:35,424
Cycle the Parker valves, and then open
the S.M.C. Circuit breakers on panel 11.

449
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,913
Hey, it's off. It's off.

450
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,416
That sounds beautiful, troops.

451
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,552
That's exactly
what we wanted to see.

452
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:55,188
Charlie, my hats off
to the guys in the trench.

453
00:36:55,188 --> 00:36:57,757
I love 'em.

454
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,126
And, by the way,
welcome to the moors sphere.

455
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:02,025
You're in the influx.

456
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,670
One of the things different
about a lunar trip...

457
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,441
is you don't pass anyplace
on the way.

458
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:19,045
Going to the moon, you leave the
launchpad, then you leave Earth orbit.

459
00:37:19,045 --> 00:37:22,649
And then a couple of days
later, after passing nothing,

460
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:25,552
all of a sudden,
you're at the moon.

461
00:37:25,552 --> 00:37:28,388
And that lack of way points, to me,

462
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:31,914
had an effect of making it seem a little
magical and mystical getting there.

463
00:37:34,494 --> 00:37:37,464
This is really a rugged planet.

464
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:41,001
We're drawing close to the moon
with the Apollo spacecraft.

465
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:44,671
Our L.O.S. Clock,
our loss of signal clock,

466
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:47,340
continues to count down
until that time...

467
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,276
that the spacecraft will pass
out of communications range...

468
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:52,278
over the backside
of the moon.

469
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:56,149
On approach, the spacecraft
just sort of dives towards...

470
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,412
and behind the moon.

471
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:05,925
It was a totally different moon than
any moon I had ever seen before.

472
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:09,195
It was in this eerie shadow.

473
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:11,965
No motion. Utterly silent.

474
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:14,734
It sort of gave one
a feeling of foreboding.

475
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:18,328
It didn't seem like a very
friendly or welcoming place.

476
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:27,080
Apollo, this is Houston.
You are go for L.O.I.

477
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,516
Go ahead, Houston.

478
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,075
Jim, you are go for the burn.
Go for the burn.

479
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:36,790
Okay. Apollo is go.

480
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,994
You're going too fast to orbit
the moon. You're rocking on ready.

481
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:43,496
Okay. Two minutes, babe.
Give it a final trim.

482
00:38:43,496 --> 00:38:47,033
Burn time is 15 seconds,
so it's gonna go in a hurry.

483
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,537
You're in the burn position.
You're ready to go.

484
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,672
Baby, let's make this one.

485
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,276
- Then there it is.
- Thirty-five seconds.

486
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:59,245
It's 2001 type stuff.

487
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:03,349
That old moors just growing
magnificently fast,

488
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:06,653
and it's just filling up
that hatch window...

489
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:09,456
and you're drifting
into the shadow.

490
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:13,026
Okay, baby. Eight, seven, six,

491
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:16,129
five, three, two, one.

492
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:18,431
Burn. Burn.

493
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:24,204
You're burning.
Okay. Seventy-eight to go,

494
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:26,906
50 to go, 20 to go.

495
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,476
- Standby, Tom.
- Shut down.

496
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:31,478
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

497
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:34,481
Apollo, Houston. You got
the burn off. We're in good shape.

498
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:36,716
Boy, I tell you.
We is down among them.

499
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,952
We is going backwards.
You know that?

500
00:39:38,952 --> 00:39:43,756
You've worked so long
and so hard, and finally you're here.

501
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,826
The burn has gone well.
You know you're in lunar orbit.

502
00:39:46,826 --> 00:39:50,330
You know the orbit is good.
You're right where you wanted to be.

503
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:54,167
And it just looked like you
could reach out and touch it.

504
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,704
Apollo now traveling
over the backside of the moon.

505
00:39:57,704 --> 00:40:01,741
The crew should be seeing the features,
the rugged features,

506
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:05,198
moving below them
at a high rate of speed.

507
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:11,451
Charlie, we just saw Earth
rise and it's gotta be magnificent.

508
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:15,682
Charlie, it might sound corny, but
the view is really out-of-this-world.

509
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:25,698
Dave, you ought to
start getting your hatch closed.

510
00:40:25,698 --> 00:40:26,699
Say again.

511
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,103
Start getting your hatch
closed if you're not already doing it.

512
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:32,105
I was disappointed.

513
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:34,874
I wanted to go with them so bad
I could taste it.

514
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:38,111
As far as I was concerned,
that's what it was all about...

515
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:41,748
not only going to the moon, but
going down to the surface and walking.

516
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:45,852
We're now less than two minutes
away from the separation burn,

517
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:48,888
which will be performed
by the command module.

518
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:51,391
When we next hear from them,
the lunar module...

519
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:53,756
should be undocked from
the command and service module.

520
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:04,304
You'll never know
how big this thing gets...

521
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:06,032
when there ain't nobody but one guy.

522
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:13,246
Yeah. Don't get lonesome
out there, John.

523
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:16,216
I wish I could go down there with 'em.

524
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,685
You may not talk about it much,

525
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,152
but part of your training
is coming back by yourself.

526
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:29,626
See you later.

527
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:34,591
I wish the damn thing
would hold three people.

528
00:43:35,855 --> 00:43:38,358
It's grown quiet here
in Mission Control.

529
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:40,393
A few moments ago,
Flight Director Gene Krantz...

530
00:43:40,393 --> 00:43:45,665
requested that everyone sit down,
get prepared for events that are coming,

531
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,668
and he closed with,
"Good luck to all of you."

532
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,999
We's go and we's down
among 'em, Charlie!

533
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:55,775
Rog, I hear ya weaving
your way up the freeway.

534
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,743
You're going
right down U.S. 1, Mike.

535
00:44:00,546 --> 00:44:03,249
Rog, copy. Looks great.

536
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:05,985
Okay, all flight controllers,
go, no go for landing. Retro.

537
00:44:05,985 --> 00:44:06,986
- Go.
- Econ.

538
00:44:06,986 --> 00:44:07,987
- Go.
- Surgeon.

539
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:08,988
- Go.
- Fido.

540
00:44:08,988 --> 00:44:09,989
- Go.
- Guidance.

541
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:11,391
- Go.
- Telcom.

542
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,392
- Go.
- G.N.C.

543
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:13,393
- Go.
- We're go for landing.

544
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:15,795
Eagle, Houston.
You are go for landing, over.

545
00:44:15,795 --> 00:44:17,730
Okay, Houston.
We'll give you a countdown.

546
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:21,968
Four, three, two, one. Fire.

547
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:26,072
Pitch over. There it is. Oh, baby.

548
00:44:26,072 --> 00:44:28,975
We are sure coming down
to that drop. Look at that rille.

549
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:32,745
That's gotta be, gotta be
probably Diamondback right there.

550
00:44:32,745 --> 00:44:35,748
When the pitch is over
and you get your first look, you know...

551
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:38,117
there's nothing but nine million
craters out there.

552
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:40,119
A terrible sinking feeling.

553
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,055
I obviously didn't recognize a thing
after studying all these photographs.

554
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,954
Nothing looked right.

555
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,129
- How you doing, control?
- We look good here. Fine.

556
00:44:50,129 --> 00:44:52,131
- How about you, Telcom?
- Go.

557
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:53,833
- Guidance, you happy? Fido?
- Go. Go.

558
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:56,969
You are go.
You're go to continue power descent.

559
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:59,368
You are go to continue
power descent. Over.

560
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:03,609
All during this power descent
I kept telling myself,

561
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:08,047
"This is not for real. You're back in
the simulator. Just remember that."

562
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:11,607
Eagle, Houston.
It's descent two fuel to monitor, over.

563
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:18,721
Eagle, Houston.
Everything's looking good here, over.

564
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:32,438
Houston, I'm getting a little
fluctuation in the A.C. Voltage now.

565
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,406
Roger. Stand by.

566
00:45:40,379 --> 00:45:43,249
Looking good to us.
You're still looking good.

567
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:45,618
Houston,
you're looking at our delta eight.

568
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,753
That's affirmative.

569
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:49,652
Looking good to us, over.

570
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:58,126
Eagle, Houston.
We'll monitor your delta eight.

571
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:06,839
Six plus two-five throttle
down. Six plus two-five throttle down.

572
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:10,309
Roger. Copy. Six plus two-five.

573
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,106
Let me try auto again now...
see what happens.

574
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,250
We got data dropout. Roger. Stand by.

575
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,419
We're go on that alarm?
If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be go.

576
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:22,455
We are go on that alarm.

577
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:24,457
Roger. I understand. Go for landing.

578
00:46:24,457 --> 00:46:26,459
Roger. We got good data.

579
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,461
Altitude velocity lights.

580
00:46:28,461 --> 00:46:32,098
Eagle, we got you now.
It's looking good, over.

581
00:46:32,098 --> 00:46:34,767
Four forward,
drifting to the right a little.

582
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:37,937
Coming at us 23, 21 down, 33 degrees.

583
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:40,540
We're go. Same type. We're go.

584
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,910
- Kicking up dust.
- A couple of big boulders.

585
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,912
Coming right. Got a good spot.

586
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:49,749
Not too bad. Here comes the shadow.

587
00:46:49,749 --> 00:46:51,648
Oh, are we coming in.

588
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,921
- Stand by for touchdown.
- Stand by.

589
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:04,227
Bam!

590
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,637
Houston, uh, Tranquility Base here.

591
00:47:11,637 --> 00:47:13,604
The eagle has landed.

592
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,043
There's a cheer in this room.

593
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:30,022
What we're witnessing now
is mars very first trip into space...

594
00:47:30,022 --> 00:47:32,080
with a station stop
along the route.

595
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,592
We gonna stay, Houston?

596
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,630
Eagle, you are stay for T-1.

597
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:49,241
This thing came to a stop on the moon.

598
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,744
It was kind of a letdown saying,

599
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:56,112
"You know, we're gonna have to get it
going fast again to get back home."

600
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,926
Neil, this is Houston.
What's your status on hatch opening?

601
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,062
Okay, Houston. I'm on the porch.

602
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:13,032
Neil, this is Houston.
Loud and clear by radio.

603
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:16,268
Check and verify
TV circuit breaker in.

604
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,338
Roger. TV circuit breakers in.

605
00:48:19,338 --> 00:48:23,909
Houston, roger. We copy,
and we're standing by for your T.E.D.

606
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:26,376
I'm gonna pull it now.

607
00:48:28,147 --> 00:48:30,549
Houston,
the mesa came down all right.

608
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:32,551
And we're getting a picture on the TV.

609
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:34,553
Got a good picture, huh?

610
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:36,747
Okay, Neil. We can see you
coming down the ladder now.

611
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:45,064
The surface seems to be
very, very fine-grained...

612
00:48:45,064 --> 00:48:47,293
as you get close to it.

613
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,996
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

614
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,773
Okay. I'm gonna step off
the LM now.

615
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:03,582
That's one small step for man,

616
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:07,312
one giant leap for mankind.

617
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:14,627
I had a bet
with somebody who didn't...

618
00:49:14,627 --> 00:49:17,830
Really felt that Neil
spent a great deal of time...

619
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,466
before he went figuring out
his famous words,

620
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:24,603
and they were not extemporaneous
on the spot historical words.

621
00:49:24,603 --> 00:49:27,006
He actually felt
that these words...

622
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,909
might have even been written
for Neil by somebody else.

623
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:33,446
And I said,
"Well, I'll bet you 500 bucks...

624
00:49:33,446 --> 00:49:35,715
"that when I get to the bottom
of the ladder...

625
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:38,951
"nobody ever remembers what the second
person to do something does anyhow...

626
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:41,954
I'm gonna say,
"It may have been a small step for Neil,

627
00:49:41,954 --> 00:49:44,490
but it's a big step
for a little fella like me."

628
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,492
Are you ready for me to come out?

629
00:49:46,492 --> 00:49:47,993
Okay.

630
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:52,565
I want to back up
and partially close the hatch,

631
00:49:52,565 --> 00:49:55,897
making sure not to lock it
on my way out.

632
00:49:58,237 --> 00:50:00,906
So this person says,
"Ah, no way you're gonna do that.

633
00:50:00,906 --> 00:50:02,908
They're gonna tell you
what to say."

634
00:50:02,908 --> 00:50:06,312
I said, "Okay, a bet's a bet."
So I bet this person $500,

635
00:50:06,312 --> 00:50:09,682
and when I got to the bottom
of the ladder, I said it.

636
00:50:09,682 --> 00:50:13,515
And that may have been a small one
for Neil, but that's a long one for me.

637
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:21,093
12 Houston, we have you
in blushing black and white.

638
00:50:21,093 --> 00:50:23,896
What happened to the color?

639
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,132
Maybe the color wheel will come up.

640
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:28,534
I can feel the wheels running...

641
00:50:28,534 --> 00:50:30,536
because I can feel something
in motion inside.

642
00:50:30,536 --> 00:50:33,739
Why don't you put your glove
in front of the lens?

643
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,741
All right. Will do.

644
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,678
- That's coming in there now.
- Got the ol' camera running.

645
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:41,680
Okay.
What change did you make?

646
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,017
I hit it on the top with my hammer.

647
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:47,253
I figured we didn't have
a thing to lose.

648
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,355
I can't believe it.

649
00:50:49,355 --> 00:50:51,254
I want you to watch this.

650
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,129
I don't know
if this'll work or not, Charlie.

651
00:50:57,129 --> 00:51:00,332
Well, in my left hand
I have a feather,

652
00:51:00,332 --> 00:51:02,635
in my right hand, a hammer.

653
00:51:02,635 --> 00:51:05,371
And I guess one of the reasons
we got here today...

654
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:08,507
was because of a gentleman
named Galileo a long time ago...

655
00:51:08,507 --> 00:51:10,910
who made a rather
significant discovery...

656
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,479
about falling objects
in gravity fields.

657
00:51:13,479 --> 00:51:16,715
And we thought that where
would be a better place...

658
00:51:16,715 --> 00:51:20,486
to confirm his findings
than on the moon?

659
00:51:20,486 --> 00:51:24,056
And so we thought
we'd try it here for ya.

660
00:51:24,056 --> 00:51:26,725
The feather happens to be,
appropriately, a falcon feather,

661
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:29,695
for our falcon.

662
00:51:29,695 --> 00:51:32,531
And I'll drop
the two of them here,

663
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:35,134
and, hopefully, they'll hit
the ground at the same time.

664
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,136
How about that?

665
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:41,440
That proves that Mr. Galileo
was correct in his findings.

666
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,743
We've got a beautiful picture
of you guys up down here.

667
00:51:44,743 --> 00:51:47,643
Let me tell you, Bob. This flag
is a beautiful picture.

668
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:53,652
Hey, John, this is perfect,
with the LM, you and the ol' flag.

669
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,055
We really should set the flag up
on a hill, Charlie,

670
00:51:56,055 --> 00:51:58,057
but there just ain't one.

671
00:51:58,057 --> 00:52:00,226
I know, John.

672
00:52:00,226 --> 00:52:03,429
I'll put it right here. Big rock.

673
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:07,533
I was proud for our country
more than I was proud for me.

674
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:09,735
And it was nothing that I did.

675
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:12,638
I just happened to have gotten
there at the right time.

676
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:15,474
My background
carried me through.

677
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:18,510
But there were a lot of other
qualified people that didn't go.

678
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,069
Why my name came out,
I don't know.

679
00:52:28,654 --> 00:52:31,056
And we very proudly
deploy it on the moon...

680
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:33,792
to stay for as long
as it can,

681
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:36,762
in honor of all those people who have
worked so hard to put us here...

682
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:40,595
and to make the country and mankind
something different than it was.

683
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:44,803
It was like sitting
in the last row of the balcony,

684
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:47,673
looking down
at that play going on.

685
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:52,473
While I was in the play, it was
more like I was a spectator.

686
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,582
Tranquility, this is Houston.

687
00:52:56,582 --> 00:53:00,719
We'd like to say, from all of us
down here in Houston,

688
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,122
and, really, from all of us...

689
00:53:03,122 --> 00:53:05,457
in all the countries
in the entire world,

690
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:09,428
we think that you've done
a magnificent job up there today, over.

691
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:13,098
Thank you very much.
Have you had enough TV for today?

692
00:53:13,098 --> 00:53:16,902
Yes, indeed. It's been
a mighty fine presentation there.

693
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,605
Thank you. Couldn’t have enjoyed it
as much as we did.

694
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:23,075
Get some rest there
and have at it tomorrow.

695
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,711
Okay. Signing off.
See you again tomorrow.

696
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:28,714
All systems on the lunar module
are in good order.

697
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:32,581
We have not heard from Tranquility base
since saying good night.

698
00:53:36,221 --> 00:53:38,924
My mind's one that
just goes constantly,

699
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,660
so I took a sleeping pill.

700
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,559
Slept like a baby.

701
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:49,123
I had one dream
that was very vivid.

702
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,765
In my dream, we were driving
the Rover up to the north.

703
00:53:56,875 --> 00:54:00,612
And you didn't really feel
like you were out there.

704
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,782
It was untouched.

705
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,218
The serenity of it...

706
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:09,778
had a pristine purity about it.

707
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,760
We crossed a hill.

708
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,596
I felt, "Gosh, I've been here before."

709
00:54:17,596 --> 00:54:21,700
And there was a set of tracks
out in front of us.

710
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,504
So we asked Houston if we could follow
the tracks, and they said yes.

711
00:54:25,504 --> 00:54:27,903
And we turned and followed the tracks.

712
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:34,013
Within an hour or so
we found this vehicle.

713
00:54:34,013 --> 00:54:36,248
It looked just like the Rover.

714
00:54:36,248 --> 00:54:40,052
The two people in it...
they looked like me and John...

715
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:44,147
had been there
for thousands of years.

716
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:08,747
It was not a nightmare-type
situation... nothing like that.

717
00:55:08,747 --> 00:55:12,182
Probably one of the most real
experiences in my life.

718
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,870
I'd have traded
on the drop of a hat...

719
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,769
to go and land on the moon.

720
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:45,684
I'm one of these nuts.
I like classical music,

721
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:48,709
and I almost learned
to like country and western.

722
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:02,468
One of the things I took was Berlioz'
"Symphonie Fantastique,"

723
00:56:02,468 --> 00:56:07,370
which seemed like that was appropriate
to be taking to the moon.

724
00:56:52,217 --> 00:56:54,686
And I was floating along,

725
00:56:54,686 --> 00:56:57,723
just laying back
and enjoying life.

726
00:56:57,723 --> 00:56:59,925
I had just crossed
the face of the moon,

727
00:56:59,925 --> 00:57:01,824
going towards the darkness.

728
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:22,014
And here's this strange scene,
this music.

729
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:24,650
And it just seemed to put it
all together in one moment...

730
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,847
that you could completely forget
that this is a real situation.

731
00:57:32,691 --> 00:57:34,693
This is Apollo control Houston...

732
00:57:34,693 --> 00:57:40,098
at 104 hours, 31 minutes
now into this historic mission.

733
00:57:40,098 --> 00:57:44,736
The lunar surface temperature in the sun
should be around 135 degrees today.

734
00:57:44,736 --> 00:57:47,239
In the shade, the temperature
would again be around minus 100...

735
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:50,075
to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

736
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:52,611
That would be in the shadow
of the lunar module.

737
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:54,613
Ah, look at that!

738
00:57:54,613 --> 00:57:57,604
Ah, it's a panoramic scene
of beauty!

739
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:03,715
Al, can you find the earth?

740
00:58:06,058 --> 00:58:08,427
Oh, there it is. I see it.

741
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:10,862
Looking at the earth
down there, Houston.

742
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:14,066
It looks like you're littler
than a golf ball at arm's length now.

743
00:58:14,066 --> 00:58:16,068
Sure looks pretty, though.

744
00:58:16,068 --> 00:58:18,399
Really looks spectacular.

745
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,441
It seemed very unreal to me...

746
00:58:22,441 --> 00:58:25,510
to be there,
looking back at the earth,

747
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,947
thinking how far,
far away it was.

748
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:31,847
This is the moon.
That is the earth.

749
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:35,420
I'm really here.

750
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,091
We're allowing about five
minutes for the drive to station three.

751
00:58:39,091 --> 00:58:41,193
Okay. Safety belts on.

752
00:58:41,193 --> 00:58:44,062
And here we go.

753
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,064
How's the driving, John? Pretty easy?

754
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,432
Driving good.

755
00:58:47,432 --> 00:58:49,434
Man, Indie's never seen
a driver like this. Barney Oldfield.

756
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:53,605
Charlie,
what should we be heading for?

757
00:58:53,605 --> 00:58:56,441
- Those craters up there.
- Don't tell me that.

758
00:58:56,441 --> 00:58:58,243
Boy, this is so neat.

759
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,245
You look like you're headed
just about for our spot.

760
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,281
- See Survey Ridge down there?
- Yep.

761
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:06,118
This is gonna be spectacular!

762
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:08,120
No, not through this crater.

763
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,857
- Yeow! Whoa!
- Trying to see if you're nervous.

764
00:59:11,857 --> 00:59:13,992
OI' Barney's really driving this beauty.

765
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:15,994
Only way to fly, Tony.

766
00:59:15,994 --> 00:59:20,165
This is gonna be such a
spectacular view, you can't believe
it.

767
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:22,894
Well, that's good news.

768
00:59:24,202 --> 00:59:26,471
We're here! You did it!

769
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:29,641
Hey, that was a good stop.
Those wheels just locked.

770
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:32,477
Marked off! Super.

771
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:35,747
John, did you dust that TV lens?

772
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:38,450
Get some dirt in your eye, Houston?

773
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,387
That does a good job on the lens there.

774
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:46,091
You want us to go up
and travel along that ridge?

775
00:59:46,091 --> 00:59:48,490
Yeah, why don't you press on up there?

776
00:59:53,065 --> 00:59:57,703
I think
the best place here for the ALSEP...

777
00:59:57,703 --> 01:00:00,639
is to the LM's
11:00 position.

778
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,903
That sounds good, Charlie.
And, John, it's 2-6-6.

779
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:11,416
I felt very welcome there.

780
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:14,386
You know, the moors been waiting for us
for thousands of years...

781
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:16,888
millions of years, maybe,

782
01:00:16,888 --> 01:00:19,624
unless someone else has already been
there before us at some time.

783
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:21,626
That's possible,

784
01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:25,230
although we didn't see
any evidence of that.

785
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,233
I felt like I was the only one
there, but not an alien...

786
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:33,038
not an alien in terms of
invading someone else's domain.

787
01:00:33,038 --> 01:00:35,941
I didn't find the moon hostile.

788
01:00:35,941 --> 01:00:38,276
I found it
very majestically beautiful.

789
01:00:38,276 --> 01:00:40,835
Bland in color,
but majestically beautiful.

790
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,884
There's a look at that
glass-covered one right there.

791
01:00:45,884 --> 01:00:48,120
Pretty good size, isn't it?

792
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,822
It looks like
it's about three days old.

793
01:00:50,822 --> 01:00:53,992
So it must be on the order
of four billion.

794
01:00:53,992 --> 01:00:56,895
So let's fill this one up,
and then...

795
01:00:56,895 --> 01:00:59,765
Ah, rats!

796
01:00:59,765 --> 01:01:03,068
Betcha that looked like
a comedy of errors on the tube.

797
01:01:03,068 --> 01:01:06,204
Yeah.

798
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,007
Hold still.

799
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:12,911
That is a crystalline rock
if I've ever seen a crystalline rock.

800
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:15,747
- First one today.
- Yeah.

801
01:01:15,747 --> 01:01:17,983
We gotta get over
this ridge, John.

802
01:01:17,983 --> 01:01:20,585
Do you want to take off
and go that way now?

803
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:22,587
Yeah.

804
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:25,757
John, did you make those
little footprints here?

805
01:01:25,757 --> 01:01:28,093
Yeah, I guess I did.

806
01:01:28,093 --> 01:01:31,323
Aah, the old footprints
on the crater rim.

807
01:01:33,265 --> 01:01:36,165
There's a good rock
right there.

808
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:41,065
Look at the size of that rock!

809
01:01:43,475 --> 01:01:46,841
I thought this thing
was just right next door to us.

810
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,178
Well, Tony, that's
your house rock right there.

811
01:01:56,421 --> 01:02:00,254
It's got black streaks
coming out of it.

812
01:02:10,368 --> 01:02:13,405
This is tough going here.

813
01:02:13,405 --> 01:02:15,407
Let me have the shovel.

814
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:19,110
I'll get it. Just a minute.

815
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,441
Good deal, boy.

816
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:25,150
There you go.

817
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:27,242
I can't get going here.

818
01:02:31,256 --> 01:02:35,227
You've got about ten minutes
left before we have to leave.

819
01:02:35,227 --> 01:02:37,922
- Is that okay for you?
- Yep, sure is.

820
01:02:39,264 --> 01:02:41,629
338 is the soil sample.

821
01:02:43,502 --> 01:02:45,637
That is the best sample we got.

822
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,866
- I know it.
- I'll tell ya.

823
01:02:51,543 --> 01:02:54,279
You just had to steal time now and then.

824
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:56,882
You just had to stop
chipping at a rock...

825
01:02:56,882 --> 01:03:01,753
and figure out that bringing back
some kind of thought and feeling...

826
01:03:01,753 --> 01:03:05,423
was as important as bringing
another chunk of rock back.

827
01:03:05,423 --> 01:03:09,361
And not being a machine but being
a human being, you have to stop and say,

828
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:12,063
"Do you know where you are
and what you're looking at?"

829
01:03:12,063 --> 01:03:16,701
And try and take in, in those
few moments of privacy you have,

830
01:03:16,701 --> 01:03:19,704
everything there is to take in
in that moment.

831
01:03:19,704 --> 01:03:22,194
You've got five minutes here.

832
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:26,642
And all of a sudden,
you've got to get to work.

833
01:03:30,415 --> 01:03:32,851
Okay, Houston,
as I stand out here...

834
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,587
in the wonders
of the unknown at Hadley,

835
01:03:35,587 --> 01:03:39,357
I realize there's a fundamental
truth to our nature:

836
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,324
Man must explore.

837
01:03:47,899 --> 01:03:50,068
One of the things
you gotta stop and do...

838
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:52,904
is make sure to have fun too.

839
01:03:52,904 --> 01:03:55,807
Because you're only probably
gonna come this way once.

840
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:05,550
- No, May.
- May.

841
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,759
Boy, is this
a neat way to travel.

842
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,625
Isn't it great?

843
01:04:20,932 --> 01:04:24,736
- I like to skip along.
- Not me, boy. Skip.

844
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:29,240
Well, whatever you call it.
I can't get my left leg in front of me.

845
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,588
It was almost dangerous.

846
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,625
You lose sight of the fact
that it's a vacuum out there,

847
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:50,228
and if you spring a leak in that
suit, you're gonna be dead.

848
01:04:50,228 --> 01:04:52,752
Uh-oh.

849
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,742
Nice soft Navy landing.

850
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:08,178
Yahoo!

851
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:12,846
Boy, do I like to run up here.

852
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:20,058
I feel like Bugs Bunny.
This is neat.

853
01:05:20,058 --> 01:05:22,753
Here come the Bobbsey twins.

854
01:05:24,195 --> 01:05:26,398
You're pretty agile there,
twinkle toes.

855
01:05:26,398 --> 01:05:29,300
I'm going out for the ballet
when I get back.

856
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,670
You learn another
line of work up here.

857
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:34,072
And while you're
bouncing around there,

858
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:37,336
you might keep your eye out
for a nearby crater.

859
01:05:40,612 --> 01:05:44,513
Ah, rats. I been on my knees
twice to get that.

860
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,121
- John.
- Yes, sir?

861
01:05:50,121 --> 01:05:53,692
You are black
from the knees down.

862
01:05:53,692 --> 01:05:57,929
No way to avoid it. That's why I'm glad
the pressure suit bends.

863
01:05:57,929 --> 01:06:00,865
John, you are filthy.

864
01:06:00,865 --> 01:06:04,969
I'll tell you, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

865
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:08,028
Hey, here's a rock they'll
be glad to see in Houston.

866
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,278
Man, Tony, you don't know
how much fun this has been.

867
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:16,212
We concur, John.

868
01:06:19,784 --> 01:06:22,187
Having gotten away from the spacecraft,

869
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:24,756
I was able to really realize...

870
01:06:24,756 --> 01:06:28,316
what this place was like
that we had landed in.

871
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:34,766
I had tried to anticipate
what it would be like for many years,

872
01:06:34,766 --> 01:06:38,870
but it was obvious that there was no way
one could have anticipated...

873
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:42,674
what it would be like to stand
in the valley of Taurus Litterol,

874
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:46,611
a place deeper than the Grand Canyon
and equally as spectacular,

875
01:06:46,611 --> 01:06:49,414
and see this brilliantly
illuminated landscape...

876
01:06:49,414 --> 01:06:53,818
with a brighter sun than anyone
had ever stood in before,

877
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:56,387
with a blacker-than-black sky,

878
01:06:56,387 --> 01:07:00,158
and then to top the whole scene off,
in this blacker-than-black sky...

879
01:07:00,158 --> 01:07:02,994
was a beautiful,
brilliantly illuminated...

880
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:06,131
blue marble
that we call the earth.

881
01:07:06,131 --> 01:07:09,998
The path of evolution is now
in space as much as on Earth.

882
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:15,140
Man has shown
that as a species...

883
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,109
mankind was willing
to commit itself...

884
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:21,846
to living in environments that
were completely different...

885
01:07:21,846 --> 01:07:25,116
than those in which
the species evolved.

886
01:07:25,116 --> 01:07:27,886
We put a shield of life
around ourselves...

887
01:07:27,886 --> 01:07:30,955
in order to protect
the life within,

888
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:33,658
but the willingness
to go out there is there.

889
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:35,660
We've shown that.

890
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,763
The curve of human evolution
has been bent.

891
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:41,299
Okay, it's time to load up right now.

892
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:44,068
We're on our way again, Tony.

893
01:07:44,068 --> 01:07:48,339
We'd like you to drive
gingerly up to the ALSEP area there.

894
01:07:48,339 --> 01:07:50,341
Okay, we'll go on up.

895
01:07:50,341 --> 01:07:52,443
You want to go right or left?

896
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,846
We want to head...
Just keep going west.

897
01:07:54,846 --> 01:07:56,915
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hook a left.

898
01:07:56,915 --> 01:07:59,684
You gotta expect trouble
from backseat drivers.

899
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:01,786
Okay, we copy that, John.

900
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,622
Look at this baby. I'm really
getting confidence in it now.

901
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,758
This back wheel's off the ground.

902
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:09,427
Charlie, whatever you do,
don't hit that brake.

903
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:11,796
The Grand Prix drivers are at it again.

904
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,932
This is about the neatest
thing I ever saw.

905
01:08:13,932 --> 01:08:15,767
It's back to the LM,
right, Tony?

906
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:17,368
You bet your life.

907
01:08:17,368 --> 01:08:20,371
And you're well ahead
on the time line.

908
01:08:20,371 --> 01:08:23,374
We must've forgotten
something. That's all I can say.

909
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:25,376
Well, everything's running.

910
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:27,946
We're just about to start
upslope here.

911
01:08:27,946 --> 01:08:29,948
Have we been climbing, John?

912
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:33,184
Look at that pitch meter.
It's pegged out high.

913
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:35,320
Yeah, we have been climbing.

914
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,555
Tony, we've really...

915
01:08:37,555 --> 01:08:41,459
It doesn't feel like we're climbing, but
we've been climbing for a while here.

916
01:08:41,459 --> 01:08:46,130
We're going up a steep, steep
slope, John. I'll tell you.

917
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,399
Look at that, Charlie.

918
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,401
I don't see. What? What?

919
01:08:50,401 --> 01:08:52,070
Well, I'll be doggoned.

920
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:53,738
Look at that!

921
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:56,741
You said you were gonna see
some other tracks on the moon.

922
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:58,640
I knew it.

923
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,881
We're going back down
our tracks, Tony.

924
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:04,816
Okay, good show.

925
01:09:04,816 --> 01:09:07,385
There she is, John.

926
01:09:07,385 --> 01:09:10,088
Somebody up there likes us.

927
01:09:10,088 --> 01:09:12,487
Don't run into our home.

928
01:09:16,895 --> 01:09:21,232
I felt like I was an alien
as I travelled through space.

929
01:09:21,232 --> 01:09:25,203
But when I got on the moon,
I didn't feel that at all.

930
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:30,208
I felt at home there, even though
the earth was a long ways away.

931
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:34,412
We could see it directly above,
about the size of a marble...

932
01:09:34,412 --> 01:09:38,973
and realize that we were there
but by the grace of God.

933
01:09:40,518 --> 01:09:43,187
I felt like I was at the end
of a thin cord...

934
01:09:43,187 --> 01:09:45,657
that could be cut
at any time.

935
01:09:45,657 --> 01:09:49,217
It was precarious,
but yet I felt comfortable.

936
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:58,598
I felt something other than
what we can visually sense.

937
01:10:00,438 --> 01:10:03,201
A spiritual presence was there.

938
01:10:06,144 --> 01:10:11,082
Perhaps it was because so many people on
the earth were focusing their attention.

939
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:14,414
They were maybe sending signals
to us somehow.

940
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:19,424
I sensed,
I guess in a way,

941
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:24,629
much like maybe the first man
on the earth would have sensed...

942
01:10:24,629 --> 01:10:27,899
like Adam or perhaps Eve...

943
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:31,302
as they were standing on the earth
and they realized they were all alone.

944
01:10:31,302 --> 01:10:33,471
There was no one else
on the earth,

945
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,574
but yet they had
that special communication.

946
01:10:36,574 --> 01:10:39,777
And I guess it was similar
to the feeling I had...

947
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,146
when I realized
that Dave Scott and I...

948
01:10:42,146 --> 01:10:45,583
were the only two
on this vast planet.

949
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:49,187
Another world.
We were the only two there.

950
01:10:49,187 --> 01:10:52,383
We felt an unseen love.

951
01:10:54,325 --> 01:10:56,224
We were not alone.

952
01:11:05,069 --> 01:11:06,571
Hi, big guy.

953
01:11:06,571 --> 01:11:09,368
Hi there, Charlie.

954
01:11:26,924 --> 01:11:30,161
Bob, this is Gene,
and I'm on the surface.

955
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:33,498
And as I take mars
last step from the surface,

956
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,000
in everlasting commemoration...

957
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,070
of what the real meaning
of Apollo is to the world,

958
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,539
we'd like to uncover a plaque...

959
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:44,275
that has been on the leg
of our spacecraft...

960
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:49,041
that we have climbed down
many times over the last three days.

961
01:11:58,256 --> 01:12:00,258
The words are...

962
01:12:00,258 --> 01:12:04,929
"Here man completed his first
exploration of the moon.

963
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:08,366
"May the spirit of peace
in which we came...

964
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:12,236
"be reflected in the lives...

965
01:12:12,236 --> 01:12:14,863
of all mankind."

966
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:27,985
Some 7 minutes,
22 seconds away from ignition...

967
01:12:27,985 --> 01:12:31,489
on the LM ascent
back into lunar orbit.

968
01:12:31,489 --> 01:12:34,192
- Capcom.
- Go.

969
01:12:34,192 --> 01:12:35,893
- Surgeon.
- Go.

970
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,328
- G and C.
- Go.

971
01:12:37,328 --> 01:12:38,830
- Fido.
- Go.

972
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:42,333
AFD. Oh, we don't have
an AFD. FAO?

973
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,435
Network. Recovery.

974
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:47,631
Capcom, we're go for liftoff.

975
01:12:48,206 --> 01:12:51,876
Tranquility Base, Houston.
You're cleared for takeoff.

976
01:12:51,876 --> 01:12:55,038
Roger. Understand.
We're number one on the runway.

977
01:12:56,981 --> 01:12:59,050
The moon is different.

978
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:05,022
It's become mars first outpost,
our first footstep in space.

979
01:13:05,022 --> 01:13:08,326
Where man was able to look back
at the earth and see the earth,

980
01:13:08,326 --> 01:13:11,920
and see himself
in a different perspective.

981
01:13:13,464 --> 01:13:16,467
Six, five, four,

982
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:20,664
three, two, one, ignition.

983
01:13:29,814 --> 01:13:33,918
As you leave, you're leaving
this unbelievably beautiful...

984
01:13:33,918 --> 01:13:38,556
naked charcoal ball
out there in space.

985
01:13:38,556 --> 01:13:41,592
And you've been around the moon.
You've been on it.

986
01:13:41,592 --> 01:13:43,761
You're seeing something
that's familiar to you.

987
01:13:43,761 --> 01:13:45,930
That's home.
That's where we lived.

988
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,199
There's where we left
the lunar rover.

989
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:50,268
There's the mountains
and the valleys.

990
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:53,905
It has, in a sense, been a home,
a life-sustaining home for you.

991
01:13:53,905 --> 01:13:56,908
And when you leave it
and you see those things,

992
01:13:56,908 --> 01:13:59,777
you leave it with the same kind
of feeling and awe...

993
01:13:59,777 --> 01:14:03,337
that you left the earth with
several days earlier.

994
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:49,827
When we were about 30 minutes
from rendezvous with the module,

995
01:14:49,827 --> 01:14:53,331
Pete said to me,
"You want to fly this thing?"

996
01:14:53,331 --> 01:14:56,100
And I said,
"Well, yeah, I'd like to fly."

997
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,603
As I took the controls,
I said, "Wait a minute.

998
01:14:58,603 --> 01:15:02,006
The people on Earth in Mission
Control aren't gonna like this."

999
01:15:02,006 --> 01:15:05,209
And to show how he thinks
about things, he said,

1000
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:09,372
"Don't worry. We're on the back side
of the moon. They'll never know."

1001
01:15:57,995 --> 01:16:00,598
Houston. You're looking good.

1002
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:04,335
Roger, Houston.
We are returning to the earth. Over.

1003
01:16:04,335 --> 01:16:07,098
Glad to have you
on the way back home.

1004
01:16:08,973 --> 01:16:11,409
I think I must have the feeling...

1005
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:14,645
that the travelers on the old
sailing ships used to have.

1006
01:16:14,645 --> 01:16:17,348
You've gone on a very long
voyage away from home,

1007
01:16:17,348 --> 01:16:19,611
and now we're headed back.

1008
01:16:27,091 --> 01:16:29,894
I have that feeling of being
proud of the trip...

1009
01:16:29,894 --> 01:16:33,795
but still happy to be going back
home and back to our home port.

1010
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:01,125
We set sail on this new sea...

1011
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:04,428
because there is new knowledge
to be gained...

1012
01:17:04,428 --> 01:17:06,764
and new rights to be won,

1013
01:17:06,764 --> 01:17:11,564
and they must be won and used
for the progress of all mankind.

1014
01:17:38,562 --> 01:17:40,798
As time goes on, I truly believe

1015
01:17:40,798 --> 01:17:43,701
that you are able to pull out
of the subconscious...

1016
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:46,737
a great many things
that you absorbed...

1017
01:17:46,737 --> 01:17:50,508
in those moments while you were
there looking back at the earth.

1018
01:17:50,508 --> 01:17:53,644
And I can almost transform
my body, certainly my mind,

1019
01:17:53,644 --> 01:17:57,681
through time and space instantaneously
to that spot on the moon.

1020
01:17:57,681 --> 01:18:00,618
I know where I am
when I look at the moon.

1021
01:18:00,618 --> 01:18:03,954
It's not just some abstract,
romantic idea.

1022
01:18:03,954 --> 01:18:06,891
It's something very real to me.

1023
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,051
The stars are my home.
