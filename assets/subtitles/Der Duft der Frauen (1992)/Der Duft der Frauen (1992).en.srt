00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,880
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

339
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,466
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

340
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,263
[ Laughing ]
Did he try to soft-soap you ? Did he ?

341
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,891
No.

342
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:42,060
Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse
from you. Are you panicking ?

343
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,563
- Yeah, a little.
- Come on.

344
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,983
- You're on scholarship, right ?
- Yeah.

345
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:52,696
You're on scholarship
from Oregon... at Baird.

346
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,741
You're a long way from home, Chas.

347
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:58,118
What's that got to do
with anything ?

348
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,454
I don't know how
it works out there.

349
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:04,082
But how it works here ?
We stick together.

350
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,585
It's us against them,
no matter what.

351
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:10,589
We don't cover our ass.
We don't tell our parents.

352
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,383
Stonewall everybody !

353
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:18,096
And above all,
never, never...

354
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:21,808
Leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

355
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,895
And that's it.

356
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,397
What does that have to do
with me being on scholarship ?

357
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,775
Hey, hey !

358
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,320
I'm just tryin' to bring you
up to speed, kid, that's it.

359
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,156
Thanks.

360
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:42,037
I'll tell you what. Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

361
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,541
and call me tonight
in Vermont.

362
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:48,877
I'll be at the Sugarbush lodge,
all right ?

363
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,547
All right.

364
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,091
You all right ?

365
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,135
Yeah, I guess so.

366
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,763
Okay.

367
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:03,433
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

368
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,353
If you can keep him down to forty,
you're doin' good.

369
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,940
Try to water them down a little.
Do you know how to do that ?

370
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:14,528
- It's a long ride, honey !
- Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

371
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:18,907
Mommy, Mommy !
Don't forget Uncle Frank's walk.

372
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,076
[ Mrs. Rossi ]
Oh, ha... Yeah.

373
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,830
Uh, you have to
air him out...

374
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:27,207
a little every day.

375
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,460
Why don't you go on back there,
get yourself oriented ?

376
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:35,132
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone numbers and stuff.

377
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,759
[ Frank ] Well, I wouldn't try
a thing like that...

378
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,304
unless I knew,
would I ?

379
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,306
Just let me
speak to her.

380
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,308
Hello, beautiful.
Is that you ?

381
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:47,436
Yeah,
we spoke yesterday.

382
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,355
[ Chuckling ] You have a glass of wine
with lunch ?

383
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:53,984
You sound
a little dusky. Hmm.

384
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,946
- [ Clearing Throat ]
- Just a minute, sweetheart.

385
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,575
You're back, huh ?

386
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,202
Tenacious !

387
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,663
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag in the closet.

388
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,790
Check the top dresser drawer.
Take out the shoulder boards...

389
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:10,918
and affix them
shoulders right and left,

390
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,545
A.S.A.P.
That means now.

391
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,589
Hello.

392
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,926
Sorry to keep you
waitin', sweetheart.

393
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,470
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

394
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:27,267
but I'm catchin' a 4:00
at Logan, lookin' out my window,
and there's not a taxi in sight.

395
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,686
What happened to Chet ?

396
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,813
He didn't invest
in a radio yet ?

397
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:35,108
Hah ! Well,
get your driver on it.

398
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,820
Tell him to get
a move on.

399
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,698
Yes. Mmm.

400
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:46,036
Some kind of body has got to go
with that bedroom voice.

401
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,580
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

402
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:51,333
You bet.

403
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,335
Bye.

404
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:59,842
My val-pak's underneath the bed.
Get it out.

405
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,927
Put the boards on the blues
and fold 'em in.

406
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,597
Uh, are we going someplace,
Colonel ?

407
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:09,059
What business is that of yours ?
Don't shrug, imbecile.

408
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:14,106
I'm blind. Save your body language
for the bimbi.

409
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:19,027
- Now, get my gear out.
- Francine, get in the car.

410
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:23,407
It's almost 3:00. The goddamn
Flintstones haven't left yet.

411
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,537
[ Mr. Rossi ] Willie Rossi
must go in the car !

00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,332
- Here comes Mrs. Rossi now.
- Damn it !

413
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,794
She said good-bye to me
three times today.

414
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,005
What's she got,
separation anxiety ?

415
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:41,091
Cut her off
at the door !

416
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,137
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.

417
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,142
I wish you were
coming with us.

418
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,477
Me too.

419
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:55,189
Maybe next time.

420
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:01,361
- Drive carefully now.
- Yeah.

421

Charlie, this is
where we'll be.

00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,578
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him drink too much.

See ya, Charlie !

424
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:19,838
And no 900 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

All right,

- Tenderfoot, my foot !

take a look at that.

I touch you.
Understand ?

433
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:10,013
My shoulder boards are in
the top dresser drawer. Get them, son.

434
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:14,268
The epaulets with
the silver oak leaf.

- Are these --
- Good.

Where we going ?

Freak show central.

440
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,757
- Where's that ?
- New York City.

441
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,179
That's in New York, son.
New York State.

442
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:54,600
Uh, Mrs. Rossi didn't say anything to me
about going anywhere.

443
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,810
She forgot.

444
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:59,938
- Should we call her, 'cause I --
- You kidding me ?

445
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,817
Call her ? By the time they get to
Albany in that "hupmobile" he drives...

446
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,612
it'll be opening day
at Saratoga.

447
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:10,699
- Colonel, I can't go to New York City.
- Why not ?

448
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,784
New York --

449
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:16,538
- New York's too much responsibility.
- Ah, responsibility !

450
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,333
I had a lot of 17 year olds
my first platoon.

451
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,753
I took care of them.
All set !

452
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:26,757
How do I look ?

453
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,593
Tickets. Money.

454
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:31,595
Speech.

455
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:35,265

from my days with Lyndon.

-I knew I could count on transportation.

Are you ready ?

00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:46,818
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

- Um --
- Good ! Here you go.

Come on !
Hup to it, son !

00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,576
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

Here, tomster, come on.
Tomster, tomster. Yeah.

Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination ?

467
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,810
Our destination... New York City,

- Two for the shuttle to New York.
- I'm not shuttling anywhere.

469
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:26,859
- Look at those tickets. "First class."
- Yes, sir, first class.

470
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:30,737
You bought me a ticket ?
I never said I'd go to New York.

471
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:34,992
What are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only ?

472
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,994
Gate 46, sir.

473
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,872
- As you were, son.
- Thank you, sir.

474
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:42,499
Which way's the door ?

475
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:46,628
- Are you blind ? Are you blind ?
- Of course not.

476
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,965
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm ?

477
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:53,427
I take your arm.

478
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:58,765
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

479
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,518
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life ?

480
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,062
Yes !

00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,192
- Jack Daniels...
- You bet.

482
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:13,488
- And Diet Slice.
- The old Diet Slice.

483
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:15,866
- And a water.
- Thank you, Daphne.

484
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,826
Certainly, sir.

485
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,875
Ahh ! Mmm !

486
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:28,795
How did you know her name ?

487
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:32,257
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

488
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,511
That's an
English cologne.

489
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:39,640
But her voice is
California chickie.

490
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:43,602
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady --

491

I call her Daphne.

Oh, big things may happen to
that little thing of yours.

Look, Colonel,

- I'll get you to New York, all right ?
- Uh-huh.

495
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:01,954
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

Well, Chuck, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

Or Charles.

498
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,754
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

So, why are we
going to New York ?

All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

Where's Daphne ?
Let's get her down here.

504
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,442
She's in the back.

00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:36,071
A tail's in the tail.

506
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:38,115
Hah !

507
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:41,326
Oh, but I still smell her.
[ Sniffing ]

508
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:46,164
Women !

509
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:49,334
What can you say ?

510
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:52,004
Who made 'em ?

511
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,214
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

512
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,638
The hair --

513
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,809
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

514
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,980
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls...

515
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:14,902
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever ?

516
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:18,697
Or lips --

517
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,824
and when they touched,
yours were like...

518
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:24,661
that first swallow
of wine...

519
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,039
after you just crossed
the desert.

520
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,213
Tits ! Whoo-ah !

521
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:37,674
Big ones, little ones,

522
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,135
nipples staring
right out at ya...

523
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:43,180
Like secret searchlights.

524
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,141
Mmm.

525
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,853
And legs --

526
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,190
I don't care if
they're Greek columns...

527
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:56,693
or secondhand Steinways.

528
00:37:56,735 --> 00:38:00,113
What's between 'em,

529
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,699
passport to heaven.

530
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,536
I need a drink.

531
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:12,543
Yes, Mr. Simms,

532
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:17,548
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing:

533
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,428
pussy.

534
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,181
Hah !

535
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:29,393
Are you listening to me, son ?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

536
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:33,272
I guess you
really like women.

537
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:36,942
Oh, above all things !

538
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,450
A very, very
distant second...

539
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:50,038
is a Ferrari.

540
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:59,256
Charlie ?

541
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,508
Give me your hand.

542
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,847
This is just the start
of your education, son.

543
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,573
Whoo-ah !

544
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,659
- Where are we ?
- Where are we, eh ?

545
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:31,079
The cynosure of
all things civilized:

546
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,207
the Waldorf-Astoria.

547
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:37,669
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

548
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,671
Had a Ferrari.

549
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:42,883
Every day I held the door
open for the fucker.

550
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,968
Never even offered me
a ride.

551
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:47,012
Well, fuck him.

552
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,473
He's dead and I'm blind.

553
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,521
- Spread the word.
- Thank you, sir.

554
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:59,149
- The intelligence will be forthcoming ?
- Sir ?

555
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:01,193
On the escort scene.

556
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,779
Um, yes, sir.

557
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:07,366
- And welcome to the Waldorf.
- Gracias, amigo.

- [ Clanking ]
- Oh !

560
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,222
I'm home again.

561
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,433
Give me an inventory
on this, will you ?

562
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:40,816
All right,
where am l, in Asia ?

563
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:43,777
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he ?

564
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,572
By the windows ?

565
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:49,616
It's right here.

566
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,743
Okay.

567
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:54,162
We're in business.

568
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,252
Get me the Oak Room.

569
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:02,462
How's that inventory
comin' ?

570
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:09,428
Uh, there's Jim Beam
and Early Times.

571

Quartermaster's on the take again.
Hello.

572
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:16,435
Is Sheldon or Mack there ?

573
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:18,937
This is
Lt. Col. Frank Slade.

574
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:24,776
I used to be a regular. I used
to come in with a General Garbisch.

575
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,280
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington six feet under.

576
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:32,659
Listen up. I want a table for two, and
I don't mean Siberia, 8:15.

577
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,663
Clear them little
bottles off.

578
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,833
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

579
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,836
Tell him I want it
wall to wall with John Daniels.

580
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,089
Uh, don't you mean,
uh, Jack Daniels ?

581
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:49,885
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have --

582
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,470
That's a joke.
Hello !

583
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:55,933
This is Lt. Col. Frank Slade.
I would like a limo, 8:00.

00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,107
What are you drinkin' ?

585
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:07,861
Uh, nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

586
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,948
What's useful about it ?

587
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,826
I don't know. Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

important stuff I have to take care of.

Very well.

591
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:28,173
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

592
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:31,343
You'll dine with me and then my driver
will transport you...

00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:34,972
to the airport for the Boston Shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

unpack my bag.

- About what ?
- About you-know-what ?

manage something.

- With me ?
- Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why ?

on your shoulders.

at school, that's all.

- Spit it out !
- It's not a big deal, all right ?

Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin' ?

611
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,038
If it's not a big deal, why did you say
"real important stuff" ?

612

What are you doin', banging
the dean's daughter ? Hah !

- I'm just in a little trouble.
- What kind of trouble ?

614

I saw some guys
doing something.

615
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:58,597
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

- How'd you know that ?
- I'm a wizard.

There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

George and I saw Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

Now, the folks at Baird,

00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:35,801
they know you and George can
identify the guilty parties ?

628
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,806
Yeah, they think we can.

629
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:45,644
- George is a friend of yours.
- He's not a friend, but he's all right.

630
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:49,314
- You trust him ?
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:54,319
- He's on scholarship too ?
- No, why ?

632
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:57,781
We got George, we got Harry,
we got trouble.

They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

How do you plan on
paying for all this stuff ?

Crisp, clean dollars...
American.

657
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,739
I saved up my
disability checks.

How much did you save ?
I mean, we flew first class,

00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:27,329
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

- All part of a plan, Charlie.
- You want to let me in on it ?

Why should I ? You're not interested.
You don't give a shit !

Hmm ? Ooh !

You got 15 minutes, son. I don't think
you're gonna make it,

unless the Oak Room keeps some
complimentary helicopter on the roof.

Careful.

845
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:03,358
- Should I ring it ?
- Yeah.

846
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:11,909
Yes ?

847
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:14,453
Yes !
Who is this ?

848
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:18,916
- It's Randy.
- Randy ? You new ?

849
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:21,126
I'm your nephew.

850
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,879
Hah !
Here I am !

851
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:27,132
Your sister's been
hoarding me long enough.

852
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:30,135
- Thought it's time to spread
the riches around.
- Uncle Frank !

853

- Gloria !
- Gail.

854
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,181
Of course.

855
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:37,726
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

856
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,854
Good old Uncle Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

857
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:43,232
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

858
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:47,528
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School too.

859

Where's your
miserable father ?

860
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:52,741
Wait ! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

861
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:55,869
Give that fat heart
of his an attack. Willie !

862
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:01,041
Oh, Willie !

863

Hello, Frank.

864
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,849
- How you doin' ?
- Okay.

865
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:21,728
Here's my hand.
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,856
Nice to meet you, sir.

We talkin' Turkey Marbella ?

- Yes, we are.
- Whoo !

Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

871

You know, I always had a sneaker
for you. Come here.

Mmm.

- Where are you, Garry ?
I heard you cough.
- Who are you again ?

875
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:52,134
I'm just here at the Waldorf-Astoria
with -- Is it your brother ?

How ya doin' ?

00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,808
- Yes. Who the hell are you ?
- I'm kinda takin' care
of him for the weekend.

880
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:07,900
Sorry. Where's the booze ?
Flowin' like mud here.

881
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:12,237
To tell the truth, the colonel's
not well, I don't think.

882
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:15,407
- Not well ?
- I think he's a little lonely.

883
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:18,368
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner ?

884
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:21,079
I heard that !

885
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:23,540
I heard that.

886
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:26,251
Pay no attention to him.
That's his big-brother talk.

887
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:29,004
He's been watching out for me
since day one.

888
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:33,592
Bailed me out of more trouble...
than he'd like to remember.

889
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:36,178
- Hmm ?
- [ Gretchen ] Let me take your coat.

890
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:40,724
I meant to pick up some vino
on my way, but I blew it.

891
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:43,268
I'll send you the Rothschild
again for Christmas,

892
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:47,272
- only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.
- I'll set two more places.

893
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:50,692
- Here's your drink, Frank.
- Thank you, Randy.

894
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:53,362
Still with
Snow Queen sugar ?

895
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:57,241
Snow Flake. Why do you
always get that wrong ?

896
01:00:57,324 --> 01:01:00,619
Because it's not important for me to
get it right. What are you doing there ?

897
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:03,956
I'm Vice President
for Marketing.

898
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:08,001
Whoo-ah ! Congratulations !
Sugar is shit, though.

899
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:11,505
I told General Abrams to install
honey in the commissaries.

900
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:14,883
If the K-50s didn't blow your brains
out, sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

901
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:18,804
- Why don't we all sit down ?
- Ooh !

902
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:22,808
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie.
Be careful.

903
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:26,854
- When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.
- Let's go and eat.

904
01:01:26,937 --> 01:01:31,859
By all means.
Thank you, Charlie.

905
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:36,071
Where you wanna sit, Frank, or you gonna
arrange yourself at the head again ?

906
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:40,409
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

[ Frank ]
Where was I ? Oh !

908
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:47,207
I wake up. It's four in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with,

909
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:49,501
why I'm there
and where I am.

910

What am I gonna do ?
I got this Asian flower,

911
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:57,092
all giggly and dewy-like;

912
01:01:57,176 --> 01:02:01,054
and this hard-boiled
navy nurse outta Omaha, on the other.

913
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:05,434
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

914
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:07,895

We'll build a golden bridge.

Hah-hah !

I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers !

- Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank ?
- Honey.

I didn't know you were
so easily shocked.

922
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:39,968
I admire your sensibilities.
I'm touched.

923
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:43,096
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank...

924
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,517
- to go to the kennel ?
- What about it ?

925
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,895
- He almost put the seeing eye
dog business outta business.
- Cool it, Randy.

- It's over and done with.
- Indeed it is, Garry.

Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

I think we better be gettin' back.

to a braille watch, Frank ?
- Randy.

or do you rank on him too ?
- Honey, please.

I enjoy Randy's observations.

My wife's name is Gail, Frank.
Can you hear that ? Gail.

Excuse me.

934
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:21,552
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

935
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:24,221
but there's a
little tension in her voice.

936
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:27,099
It could be one
of two things:

937
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,560
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

938
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:34,106
What's your point,
Uncle Frank ?

939
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:36,441
You oughta go down
on her.

will ya ?

forgotten the taste of real honey !

There's fire under that dress.

- What for ?

- My friend's name is Charles.

He doesn't like
to be called Chuckie.

get-together. This is --

- Will you shut your mouth ?

- He blew himself up.
- Stop it, Randy.

965
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:04,446
Our colonel, here, had a grenade
juggling act at Fort Bragg or wherever.

- Fort Benning.
- He was teaching hand-to-hand combat --

you're talking to me, son.

His partner in the act was some captain.

- Major Vincent Squires.
- Yeah, whoever he was.

a lo-cal breakfast:

Bloody Mary for his partner.

difference does it make ?

was his eyesight.

- Wanna know the truth ?
- You got a handle on that,
do you, Randy ?

- He was an asshole before.
- Whoo-ah !

is a blind asshole.

hold I'm teaching those lieutenants.

01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:51,822
Good-bye, Willie.

1007
01:07:56,493 --> 01:08:00,497
I'm no fucking good...

1008
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:03,333
and I never have been.

1009
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:11,884
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

1010
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:21,393
Come on.
Watch your step.

1011
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:25,272
Hold it.

1012
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:41,830
Nueva York, compadre.
Vamos !

1013
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,586
[ Clinking ]

1014
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,043
You got a watch ?

1015
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:33,382
Ah, it's 7:20.

1016
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:37,427
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1017
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:39,596
Yeah, in the other room.

1018
01:09:39,638 --> 01:09:42,266
Get it.

1019
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:47,396
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1020
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:51,608
Does it have
a second hand ?

1021
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,782
Yeah.

1022
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:01,159
Time me !

1023
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:29,646
How long ?

1024
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,818
Um... about
30 seconds.

1025
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:39,031
- I'm rusty.
- Where did you get a gun, Colonel ?

1026
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:41,992
Piece or weapon, Charlie,
never a gun.

1027
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:47,247
Where did you get
the piece ?

1028
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:51,793
I'm an officer in the
United States Army. This is my sidearm.

1029
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:56,215
- But you're not an officer anymore.
- So I'm retired, so what ?

1030
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:59,593
An officer never
relinquishes his 45.

1031
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:03,597
Yeah, but you better relinquish it to me
or I'm gonna call Mrs. Rossi.

1032
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,349
Good idea.

1033
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:08,018
Then I'm going back
to school.

1034
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,729
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1035
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:14,399
I hope you have a wonderful trip.
That felt like 25.

1036
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:17,236
You oughta be able to do a 45 in 25.
Did you time me ?

1037
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:20,489
No, I did not
and I'm calling Albany.

1038
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:30,707
That was stupid.

1039
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:34,461
Was it ?

1040
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:37,297
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

1041
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:39,591
No, I'm not.

1042
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:42,010
- I'm outta here !
- Where you goin' ? New Hampshire ?

1043
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:45,931
You got no money.
How you gonna do that ?

1044
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:48,725
Mmm.

1045
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:52,771
Karen's number
tastes like Albany. Hah !

1046
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,065
Fine.

1047
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:58,402
- I'm leaving.
- Charlie ? Charlie !

1048
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:15,544
All I want from you...
is another day.

1049
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:18,046
For what ?

1050
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:24,261
One last tour
of the battlefield.

1051
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,392
I can get around a city
like New York,

1052
01:12:30,434 --> 01:12:32,394
but l...

1053
01:12:32,436 --> 01:12:36,315
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1054
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:40,444
What do you say,
Charlie ?

1055
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:43,697
What's one day...
between friends ?

1056
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:50,454
All right. Well, say
I stay for another day.

1057
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:52,789
Will you give me
your weapon ?

1058
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:56,919
Oh, Charlie ! I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1059
01:12:57,002 --> 01:12:59,463
I'm not giving my
fucking gun to anyone.

1060
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:04,092
- Now, what are you drinkin' ?
- Colonel, this -- this is unacceptable.

1061
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:09,014
Unacceptable ? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for ?

1062
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:12,601
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy ?

1063
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:14,686
Put in Harvard
Business School ?

1064
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:17,356
Then give me
your bullets.

1065
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:28,534
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you ?

1066
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:33,372
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

1067
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:36,083
So, why
should I share...

1068
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:40,420
the tribe's provisions ?

1069
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:42,965
I mean,
there's no one...

1070
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:47,469
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1071
01:13:47,511 --> 01:13:49,680
The bullets, Colonel.

1072
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:51,849
"The bullets, Colonel."

1073
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:54,643
You sound like a guy in
"Lives of a Bengal Lancer."

1074
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,540
What do you
give a shit for ?

1075
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:19,042
About what ?

1076
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,295
About what ?

1077
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:25,382
About whether I blow
my brains out or not.

1078
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:33,348
- Because I have a conscience, you know.
- You have a conscience.

1079
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:36,185
I forgot.

1080
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:40,439
The Charlie Conscience.

1081
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:45,777
Do we tell ?
Do we not tell ?

1082
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,531
Do we follow the
rich boy's code or not ?

1083
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:52,659
Do we let this
blind asshole...

1084
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:55,412
die... or not ?

1085
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:56,997
Yeah.

1086
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,208
Conscience, Charlie.

1087
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,710
When were you born, son ?

1088
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:05,714
Around the time
of the Round Table ? Hah.

1089
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:07,925
Haven't you heard ?

1090
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:11,220
Conscience is dead.

1091
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:13,972
No, I haven't heard.

1092
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:19,102
Well, then, take the
fucking wax outta your ears !

1093
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:21,104
Grow up !

1094
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:35,786
It's fuck your buddy.

1095
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:38,872
Cheat on your wife.

1096
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:44,586
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

1097
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:50,592
Charlie,
it's all shit.

1098
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:02,646
Where you goin' ?

1099
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:06,275
I got piss call.

1100
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:10,195
I know I said I need ya
for just one day,

1101
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:12,739
but even I can't hold it
that long.

1102
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:17,411
Oh, and, Charlie,

1103
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:20,122
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

1104
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:27,713
Hah !

1105
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,174
There you go,
sir.

1106
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:32,092
Thank you.

1107
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:38,515
Twenty-six years
in the service,

1108
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,851
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

1109
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:44,479
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie ?

1110
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:48,483
Playing golf with your friends
from the Baird School, I bet.

1111
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:53,697
I don't even like
those guys.

1112
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:56,992
Course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1113
01:16:57,034 --> 01:17:00,078
Be a pleasure to squeal
on 'em, wouldn't it ?

1114
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:04,583
- Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.
- "I'm not a squealer."

1115
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,752
What is this,
the Dreyfus case ?

1116
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:13,383
Ohh ! Ooh, Mama !

1117
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:15,719
There you go.

1118
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:18,722
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1119
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,766
Watch your step.

1120
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:27,064
I'm gettin' that
heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1121
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:33,779
There's more to this,
isn't there ?

1122
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:35,948
Isn't there ?

1123
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:42,162
- I was offered a bribe.
- Oh, now we're cookin'.

1124
01:17:43,747 --> 01:17:46,375
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

1125
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:50,254
he promised to
get me into Harvard.

1126
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:53,590
- If you squeal.
- Yeah.

1127
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:55,968
What a dilemma.

1128
01:17:56,051 --> 01:18:01,431
Should Charlie Simms accept a
free ride into Harvard or not ?

1129
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:05,602
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes ?

1130
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:07,771
- He is, practically.
- How ?

1131
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:12,609
I mean, it's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get him into Harvard.

1132
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:16,947
Mr. Trask doesn't have to. George's
father's gonna take care of that.

1133
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:21,827
Do the deal, Charlie.
Take it !

1134
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:24,371
Go to Harvard.

1135
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:27,291
- I can't do that.
- Why not ?

1136
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:32,671
It's just some things
you just can't do.

1137
01:18:32,754 --> 01:18:35,132
Explain 'em to me.

1138
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:40,929
- Louder, please.
- I, l, I can't --

1139
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:44,183
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1140
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:49,980
To ease the blow,
let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1141
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:52,774
[ Frank ] Double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

1142
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:57,154
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1143
01:18:57,196 --> 01:18:59,239
Hold on.
Do you have beer ?

1144
01:18:59,323 --> 01:19:01,867
Certainly.
May I see some I.D. ?

1145
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:05,162
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy ?

1146
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:06,496
Sir, but --

1147
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:10,083
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1148
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,961
Why don't you call up front,
the office ?

1149
01:19:13,003 --> 01:19:16,465
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1150
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:19,676
Any particular beer ?

1151
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,055
Schlitz.
No Schlitz ?

1152
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:25,557
Blatz.
No Blatz ?

1153
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:28,018
Improvise.

1154
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:31,313
- I'll do my best, sir.
- [ Frank ] Thank you, sir.

1155
01:19:33,023 --> 01:19:36,818
You're human, Charlie.
Beer ?

1156
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:41,406
Who are we
drinking with ?

1157
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:45,994
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1158
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:56,338
- Ah... female.
- Female ?

1159
01:19:56,421 --> 01:20:00,843
You're callin' her female, must mean you
like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1160
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:07,140
- Is she alone ?
- Yeah, she's alone.

1161
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:12,688
Things are heatin' up.
Chestnut hair ?

1162
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:16,108
Brown...
Light brown.

1163
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:19,403
Twenty-two ?

1164
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:23,782
Wh-- What am l,
a guy at a carnival ?

1165
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:27,828
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1166
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:30,163
Move.

1167
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:32,457
- Where ?
- You know where, son.

1168
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:34,835
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1169
01:20:36,128 --> 01:20:39,047
This woman is made for you.
I can feel it.

1170
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:41,383
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she ?

1171
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:46,096
- She's not bad.
- Whoo-bingo ! The boy's alive.

1172
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,808
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1173
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:53,562
Perambulate.

1174
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:04,990
Excuse me, senorita,
do you mind if we join you ?

1175
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:08,452
I'm feelin'
you're being neglected.

1176
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:12,122
Well, I'm
expecting somebody.

1177
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:15,417
Instantly ?

1178
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:19,713
- No, but any minute now.
- Any minute ?

1179
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:22,466
Some people live a lifetime
in a minute.

1180
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:28,639
- What are you doin' right now ?
- I'm waiting for him.

1181
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:31,808
Would you mind
if we waited with you,

1182
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:36,021
you know, just to keep the
womanizers from bothering you ?

1183
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:41,068
No, I don't mind.

1184
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:43,820
Thank you.

1185

Charlie.

1186
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:54,790
You know, I detect...
a fragrance in the air.

1187
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:57,251
Don't tell me
what it is.

1188
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,545
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1189
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:02,840
Ah, that's amazing.

1190
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:05,175
I'm in the amazing
business !

1191
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:07,219
It is
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1192
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:10,597
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1193
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:12,891
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

1194
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:15,769
I think she'd have liked
Charlie too.

1195
01:22:15,853 --> 01:22:18,146
- Don't pay any attention to him.
- What's your name ?

1196
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,731
Donna.

1197
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:24,528
- Donna ? I'm Frank. This here is --
- This is Charlie.

1198
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:26,738
Yes. She likes you.

1199
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:30,033
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.
He's going through a crisis.

1200
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:32,870
How does he look
like he's holding up ?

1201
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:35,914
He looks fine to me.

1202
01:22:35,956 --> 01:22:38,417
Oh ! She does
like you, Charlie.

1203
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:45,340
So, Donna,

1204
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:47,134
ah...

1205
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:49,219
do you tango ?

1206
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:52,890
No. I wanted
to learn once, but --

1207
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:55,350
But ?

1208
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:58,020
But Michael
didn't want to.

1209
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:01,481
Michael, the one
you're waiting for.

1210
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:05,277
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1211
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,614
Well, I think
Michael's hysterical.

1212
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:11,909
Don't pay any attention to him.
Did I already say that ?

1213
01:23:13,827 --> 01:23:16,330
What a beautiful laugh.

1214
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,833
Thank you, Frank.

1215
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:27,716
Would you like to learn
to tango, Donna ?

1216
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:32,804
Right now ?

1217
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:37,518
I'm offering you my services...
free of charge.

1218
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:39,561
What do you say ?

1219
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:41,438
Ah...

1220
01:23:41,522 --> 01:23:44,650
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1221
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:46,902
Of what ?

1222
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:51,240
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1223
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:55,619
No mistakes in the tango,
not like life.

1224
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:58,288
It's simple. That's what makes
the tango so great.

1225
01:23:58,372 --> 01:24:03,210
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

1226
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:06,797
[ Frank ]
Why don't you try ?

1227
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:13,220
Will you try it ?

1228
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:16,807
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1229
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:19,560
Hold me down, son.

1230
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:29,069
Your arm.

1231
01:24:30,863 --> 01:24:33,490
Charlie,

1232
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:36,118
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1233
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:39,162
The floor's
about 20 by 30,

1234
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:42,207
And you're at
the long end.

1235
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:46,295
There's tables on the outside.
The band's on the right.

1236
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,791
Oh, Frank, you are
one incredible dancer.

1237
01:27:32,336 --> 01:27:36,006
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1238
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:39,218
- He's a liar. I don't dance.
- Isn't he a charmer, though ?

1239
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:43,472
Truth is, not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1240
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:46,225
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1241
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:48,352
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1242
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:52,064
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1243
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:55,776
-Hi, Frank, Charlie. I'm sorry I'm late.
-Oh, that's okay.

1244
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:58,570
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1245
01:27:58,612 --> 01:28:01,240
and time flew.

1246
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:05,118
Your girl is...
a hell of a tango dancer.

1247
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:07,829
You found someone to tango with.
That's terrific !

1248
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:09,915
Let me
shake your hand.

1249
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:13,252
- No, it was Frank.
- Hell, I'll shake both your hands !

1250
01:28:14,753 --> 01:28:17,548
Honey, this looks like the place,
but we gotta go.

1251
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:20,717
We got a date with Darryl
and Carol in the village.

1252
01:28:20,801 --> 01:28:22,719
Do you have a check ?

1253
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:27,474
- Michael, please. My pleasure.
- No, no. I got this.

1254
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:30,394
Michael, get your hand outta
your pocket. I'll take it. Really.

1255
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:33,981
Allow me.

1256
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:36,608
Why, thank you.

[ Manny ] It's Apartment 17 E, Colonel.
She's expecting you.

1261
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:07,139
You don't have to worry about a thing.
She's the creme de la creme.

1262
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:09,683
My buddy took the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1263
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:12,186
Now he wants to immigrate
to this country.

- Yeah, real dark red.

You just caught us. We're about
to shoot George over to the airport.

1281
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:44,945
Why is George
going to the airport ?

1282
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:48,365
Um, hold on. Maybe you should talk
to the man himself.

- Chas.
- Yeah. Hi, George.

This asshole, Trask ?

no sense at all.

Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father's Class of '59.

Your father ? I thought we were
gonna keep our parents outta this.

Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

02:18:35,816 --> 02:18:36,942
I will give you
one last chance.

1843
02:18:36,984 --> 02:18:39,570
The consequences of your response
will be dire.

1844
02:18:39,653 --> 02:18:44,992
By dire I mean your future
will be jeopardized permanently.

1845
02:18:45,075 --> 02:18:47,327
Now for the last time,

1846
02:18:47,411 --> 02:18:49,997
what did you see
last Tuesday night...

1847
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:51,999
outside my office ?

1848
02:18:55,210 --> 02:18:57,171
I saw somebody.

1849
02:18:57,212 --> 02:18:59,923
"l saw somebody." Good.

1850
02:19:01,008 --> 02:19:03,010
Did you see
their size and shape ?

1851
02:19:03,093 --> 02:19:05,888
Yeah.

1852
02:19:05,971 --> 02:19:09,433
And they were
the size and shape of whom ?

1853
02:19:15,063 --> 02:19:18,901
They were
the size and shape --

1854
02:19:32,539 --> 02:19:35,334
of most any
Baird student, sir.

1855
02:19:49,264 --> 02:19:51,892
I am left
with no real witness.

1856
02:19:53,477 --> 02:19:57,356
Mr. Willis's testimony is
not only vague, it is unsubstantiated.

1857
02:19:57,397 --> 02:20:00,359
The substance I was
looking for, Mr. Simms,

1858
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:02,903
was to come from you.

1859
02:20:05,864 --> 02:20:07,824
I'm sorry.

1860
02:20:08,951 --> 02:20:11,703
I'm sorry too, Mr. Simms,

1861
02:20:11,745 --> 02:20:14,206
because you know
what I'm going to do,

1862
02:20:14,248 --> 02:20:16,583
inasmuch as I can't punish
Mr. Havemeyer,

1863
02:20:16,667 --> 02:20:18,752
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson ?

1864
02:20:18,836 --> 02:20:20,963
And I won't punish
Mr. Willis.

1865
02:20:21,046 --> 02:20:23,465
He's the only party
to this incident...

1866
02:20:23,549 --> 02:20:26,510
who is still worthy of
calling himself a Baird man.

1867
02:20:27,886 --> 02:20:31,056
I'm going to recommend to
the Disciplinary Committee...

1868
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:34,101
that you be expelled.

1869
02:20:34,142 --> 02:20:36,979
Mr. Simms, you are
a cover-up artist...

1870
02:20:37,062 --> 02:20:38,981
and you are a liar.

1871
02:20:39,064 --> 02:20:41,149
But not a snitch !

1872
02:20:41,233 --> 02:20:43,735
Excuse me ?

1873
02:20:43,819 --> 02:20:45,571
No, I don't
think I will.

1874
02:20:45,654 --> 02:20:50,242
- Mr. Slade.
- This is such a crock of shit !

1875
02:20:50,284 --> 02:20:53,161
[ Trask ] Please watch your
language, Mr. Slade.

1876
02:20:53,245 --> 02:20:56,164
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

1877
02:20:56,248 --> 02:20:59,418
Mr. Simms, I will give you one
final opportunity to speak up.

1878
02:20:59,459 --> 02:21:02,004
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

1879
02:21:02,087 --> 02:21:04,006
He doesn't need
to be labeled...

1880
02:21:04,089 --> 02:21:06,758
"still worthy of
being a Baird man."

1881
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,760
What the hell
is that ?

1882
02:21:08,802 --> 02:21:10,762
What is your motto here ?

1883
02:21:10,804 --> 02:21:15,058
"Boys, inform on your
classmates, save your hide;

1884
02:21:15,142 --> 02:21:18,020
anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you at the stake" ?

1885
02:21:18,103 --> 02:21:20,856
Well, gentlemen,

1886
02:21:20,939 --> 02:21:24,109
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run...

1887
02:21:24,193 --> 02:21:26,153
and some guys stay.

1888
02:21:26,195 --> 02:21:29,656
Here's Charlie facin' the fire,
and there's George...

1889
02:21:29,740 --> 02:21:32,034
hidin' in
big daddy's pocket.

1890
02:21:32,117 --> 02:21:34,036
And what are you doin' ?

1891
02:21:34,119 --> 02:21:35,996
You're gonna
reward George...

1892
02:21:36,079 --> 02:21:39,458
and destroy Charlie.

1893
02:21:39,499 --> 02:21:43,879
-Are you finished, Mr. Slade ?
-No, I'm just gettin' warmed up.

1894
02:21:43,962 --> 02:21:46,507
[ Slade ] I don't know who
went to this place.

1895
02:21:46,590 --> 02:21:49,301
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryant,

1896
02:21:49,343 --> 02:21:51,303
William Tell, whoever.

1897
02:21:51,345 --> 02:21:54,473
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

1898
02:21:54,515 --> 02:21:56,475
It's gone.

1899
02:21:56,517 --> 02:21:59,019
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

1900
02:21:59,061 --> 02:22:01,772
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

1901
02:22:01,855 --> 02:22:05,651
And if you think you're
preparin' these minnows for manhood,

1902
02:22:05,734 --> 02:22:07,694
you better think again,

1903
02:22:07,736 --> 02:22:10,697
because I say you are
killin' the very spirit...

1904
02:22:10,739 --> 02:22:12,908
this institution
proclaims it instills.

1905
02:22:12,991 --> 02:22:15,994
What a shame.

1906
02:22:16,078 --> 02:22:19,164
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin' on here today ?

1907
02:22:19,206 --> 02:22:22,751
I mean, the only class
in this act is sittin' next to me.

1908
02:22:22,835 --> 02:22:26,505
I'm here to tell you
this boy's soul is intact.

1909
02:22:26,588 --> 02:22:29,424
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know ?

1910
02:22:29,508 --> 02:22:32,970
Someone here, and I'm not gonna say who,
offered to buy it.

1911
02:22:33,053 --> 02:22:36,682
- Only Charlie here wasn't sellin'.
- Sir, you're out of order.

1912
02:22:36,765 --> 02:22:39,142
I show you out of order.

1913
02:22:39,226 --> 02:22:42,229
You don't know what
out of order is, Mr. Trask.

1914
02:22:42,312 --> 02:22:44,731
I'd show you,
but I'm too old,

1915
02:22:44,815 --> 02:22:47,234
I'm too tired,
too fuckin' blind.

1916
02:22:47,317 --> 02:22:50,571
If I were the man I was
five years ago, I'd take...

1917
02:22:50,654 --> 02:22:52,990
a flamethrower
to this place !

1918
02:22:55,158 --> 02:22:59,079
Out of order ? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to ?

1919
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:03,166
I've been around,
you know ?

1920
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:06,003
There was a time
I could see.

1921
02:23:06,086 --> 02:23:08,046
And I have seen.

1922
02:23:08,088 --> 02:23:10,465
Boys like these,
younger than these,

1923
02:23:10,549 --> 02:23:14,386
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

1924
02:23:14,469 --> 02:23:17,514
But there is nothin'
like the sight...

1925
02:23:17,598 --> 02:23:19,558
of an amputated spirit.

1926
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:23,353
There is
no prosthetic for that.

1927
02:23:23,437 --> 02:23:27,524
You think you're merely sendin'
this splendid foot soldier...

1928
02:23:27,608 --> 02:23:30,694
back home to Oregon with
his tail between his legs,

1929
02:23:30,736 --> 02:23:32,696

02:23:36,116 --> 02:23:38,368
And why ?

1932
02:23:38,410 --> 02:23:41,371
Because he's not
a Baird man.

1933
02:23:41,413 --> 02:23:44,208

You hurt this boy,

1934
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:47,211

Stand down, Mr. Slade !

02:23:59,431 --> 02:24:02,059
I'm not finished.

1940
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:06,188
As I came in here,
I heard those words:

1941
02:24:06,271 --> 02:24:08,315
"cradle of leadership."

1942
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:11,443
Well, when
the bough breaks,

1943
02:24:11,527 --> 02:24:14,863
the cradle will fall,
and it has fallen here.

1944
02:24:14,947 --> 02:24:16,865
It has fallen.

Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

1946
02:24:19,743 --> 02:24:23,121
Be careful what kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

1947
02:24:23,205 --> 02:24:27,000
I don't know if Charlie's
silence here today...

1948
02:24:27,084 --> 02:24:29,795
is right or wrong;
I'm not a judge or jury.

1949
02:24:29,878 --> 02:24:31,797
But I can tell you this:

1950
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:33,924
he won't sell
anybody out...

to buy his future !

1952
02:24:36,885 --> 02:24:40,931
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

1953
02:24:41,014 --> 02:24:42,975
That's called courage.

1954
02:24:43,016 --> 02:24:46,478
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

1955
02:24:51,733 --> 02:24:56,113
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

1956
02:24:56,154 --> 02:25:00,659
I always knew
what the right path was.

1957
02:25:00,742 --> 02:25:04,454
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

1958
02:25:04,538 --> 02:25:06,582
You know why ?

1959
02:25:06,665 --> 02:25:09,418
It was too damn hard.

1960
02:25:11,336 --> 02:25:14,423
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to the crossroads.

1961
02:25:14,506 --> 02:25:16,675
He has chosen a path.

1962
02:25:16,758 --> 02:25:18,886
It's the right path.

1963
02:25:18,969 --> 02:25:21,430
It's a path
made of principle...

02:29:29,303 --> 02:29:32,014
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2012
02:29:35,225 --> 02:29:37,144
Fleurs de rocailles.

2013
02:29:39,313 --> 02:29:41,273
Yes.

2014
02:29:42,274 --> 02:29:45,527
"Flowers from a brook."

2015
02:29:45,611 --> 02:29:47,821
That's right.

2016
02:29:50,449 --> 02:29:53,076
Well, Miss Downes,

2017
02:29:53,118 --> 02:29:56,580
I, I'll know
where to find you.

2018
02:29:56,663 --> 02:29:58,624
Charlie.

2019
02:29:58,665 --> 02:30:00,918
- [ Charlie ] Bye, Miss Downes.
- Bye.

2020
02:30:03,837 --> 02:30:07,549
You don't have
to tell me, Charlie.

2021
02:30:07,633 --> 02:30:10,427
5'7",

2022
02:30:10,511 --> 02:30:13,138
auburn hair,

2023
02:30:13,222 --> 02:30:16,683
beautiful
brown eyes.

2024
02:30:34,076 --> 02:30:36,286
Yabba dabba doo.

2025
02:30:37,371 --> 02:30:39,331
Hah !

2026
02:30:40,666 --> 02:30:42,793
Manny.

2027
02:30:44,127 --> 02:30:46,046
Aw, Colonel,
this is too much.

2028
02:30:46,129 --> 02:30:48,841
You earned it.
Next time Charlie and l...

2029
02:30:48,924 --> 02:30:51,718
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2030
02:30:51,802 --> 02:30:53,720
You can drive us
both ways.

2031
02:30:53,804 --> 02:30:56,431
You're on. Not only
will it be an honor,

2032
02:30:56,515 --> 02:30:58,433
I'll give you
a rate.

2033
02:30:58,517 --> 02:31:01,270
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

2034
02:31:01,353 --> 02:31:03,313
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

2035
02:31:03,355 --> 02:31:06,483
- Take care, Colonel.
- You too.

2036
02:31:06,567 --> 02:31:10,028
- Ready ?
- No, thanks, Charlie.
I'll take it from here.

2037
02:31:10,070 --> 02:31:14,032
You go on ahead.
Manny'll drive you back to your dorm.

2038
02:31:14,116 --> 02:31:17,369
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

2039
02:31:17,452 --> 02:31:19,830
We'll have a little cheer.

2040
02:31:19,872 --> 02:31:22,666
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

2041
02:31:22,708 --> 02:31:25,294
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

2042
02:31:25,377 --> 02:31:27,296
It's almost edible.

2043
02:31:28,547 --> 02:31:30,465
All right, Colonel.

2044
02:31:30,549 --> 02:31:32,342
- That'd be really --
- Bye, Charlie.

2045
02:31:52,905 --> 02:31:54,865
Who's there ?

2046
02:31:54,907 --> 02:31:57,409
- That you, Francine ?
- Yes.

2047
02:31:57,451 --> 02:32:00,746
- What are you doing ?
- Taking a ride.

2048
02:32:00,829 --> 02:32:04,208
Taking a ride ?
What about you giving me a lift ?

2049
02:32:04,291 --> 02:32:07,544
- No.
- No ?

2050
02:32:07,586 --> 02:32:10,172
Aw, come on,
Francine.

2051
02:32:10,255 --> 02:32:13,550
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up ?

2052
02:32:13,634 --> 02:32:16,011
- [ Francine ] No.
- [ Slade ] Francine ?

2053
02:32:16,094 --> 02:32:18,013
- What ?
- Your Uncle Frank's had himself...

2054
02:32:18,096 --> 02:32:22,684
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2055
02:32:22,768 --> 02:32:24,686
- [ Willie Muttering ]
- What's that ?

2056
02:32:24,770 --> 02:32:26,980
I hear a chipmunk.

2057
02:32:27,064 --> 02:32:29,024
Is it a walrus ?

2058
02:32:29,107 --> 02:32:31,026
No, it's Willie.

2059
02:32:31,109 --> 02:32:33,862
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag ?

2060
02:32:33,946 --> 02:32:36,782
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2061
02:32:36,865 --> 02:32:39,117
Come on. Come on.

2062
02:32:39,201 --> 02:32:41,995
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong.

2063
02:32:42,079 --> 02:32:44,248
Come on.

2064
02:32:45,457 --> 02:32:47,960
Here we are.

2065
02:32:48,043 --> 02:32:50,504
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

2066
02:32:50,587 --> 02:32:53,382
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2067
02:32:53,465 --> 02:32:56,218
- Whaddaya say ?
- Okay.
