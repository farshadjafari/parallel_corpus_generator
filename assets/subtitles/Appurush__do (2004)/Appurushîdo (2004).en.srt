1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,830
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven,

2
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:27,095
and did cast them to the earth:

3
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,765
and the dragon stood before the woman
which was ready to be delivered,

4
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,430
for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

5
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,851
- (Revelations 12:4)

6
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,557
<i>Her movements fit perfectly with the data's prediction.</i>

7
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:03,517
<i>Target acquired. Target acquired.</i>

8
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:18,542
<i>Regroup. Patrol surrounding area for enemy fire.</i>

9
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,716
<i>Emergency com use only.</i>

10
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:22,341
Step aside, would you?!

11
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,961
<i>Target acquired. Target acquired.</i>

12
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,597
The problem with these tranquilizer rounds
is that they burst the body.

13
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:45,328
That's her. Deunan Knute has been secured!

14
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,987
She's beautiful...

15
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:47,089
8 hours, 12 minutes.
She sure knows how to sleep.

16
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:52,493
For a legendary she's awfully cute when she sleeps.

17
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,995
Do you think she knows about your body?

18
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,075
She's bound to be amazed!

19
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,802
At seeing our Utopia.

20
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:08,818
Utopia, huh...?

21
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:13,485
<i>Olympus AF5, we are requesting permission to land.</i>

22
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:18,108
Keep a wide berth until they confirm our ID.

23
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,567
Otherwise the Mobile Fortress
will fill us full of holes.

24
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,516
Olympus Af5, this is...

25
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,396
<i>Identification's verified.
Proceed to platforms.</i>

26
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:26,718
Landing clearance confirmed.

27
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:30,650
This is ES.W.A.T. G2E9.
Commencing landing procedure.

28
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,117
Briareos!

29
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:20,516
I'm going up ahead to scout around.

30
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:21,652
I'll come with you.

31
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,558
No, Deunan. Stay here.

32
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,097
Relax. I'll be back before you know it.

33
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:31,713
Briareos...

34
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,712
So, I see you gave her a full work-up.

35
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:09,227
Just following orders from the Legislature.

36
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,964
Can't believe she's still asleep...

37
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,293
Maybe we gave her the wrong dose of anesthesia?

38
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,618
Move and I'll snap your neck!

39
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,834
2nd Platoon Leader Deunan Knute,
stand down at once!

40
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:54,701
Briareos...

41
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:19,693
I don't believe it.

42
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:23,651
I know this is hard, but the facts are there, Deunan.

43
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:27,329
Are you saying that after all those years of fighting

44
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:29,950
there was no clear winner to the Global War?

45
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,041
Right. And now Olympus governs the world.

46
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:37,403
The ruling body is comprised of the former
General Administration Agency.

47
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,342
So, for months

48
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:43,539
I've been fighting one meaningless battle
after another without knowing anything.

49
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:45,898
Well, that's war for you.

50
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:51,502
But in Olympus mankind has finally
achieved its state of Utopia

51
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,937
in a fair and balanced society.

52
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,760
So, what do you need me for?

53
00:13:57,225 --> 00:14:00,858
Even an ideal society still requires great warriors.

54
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,953
ES.W.A.T. has had you on the top of the
reinforcement list for some time now.

55
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:09,700
You see, it's my job to find elite soldiers
from the outside world, such as yourself,

56
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,643
and bring them here to Olympus.

57
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,498
ES.W.A.T.?

58
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:16,402
I'm sure you must have a lot of questions,

59
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:18,332
but let's leave them till tomorrow, all right?

60
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,285
For now, just get some rest.

61
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,688
I'll swing by in the morning and give you a tour.

62
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:27,626
I just know you're going to like it here,
our little Utopia.

63
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,537
Your bedroom is right in here.

64
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:36,727
It must be ages since you slept in a warm bed.

65
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,612
I'll pick you up at 10 am sharp.

66
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,851
Hitomi... That's your name, right?

67
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:45,286
Correct.

68
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:47,690
Do we know each other?

69
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,714
I don't think so. Good night.
I'll see you in the morning.

70
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:06,574
When did you...

71
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:09,572
On the North African front.

72
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,063
My body was badly damaged.

73
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,053
That was a year ago.

74
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,768
It was Carl's...

75
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,607
A keepsake of your father.

76
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:31,988
Don't let it get confiscated.

77
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:42,028
Call me if you need anything.

78
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:44,663
Briareos...

79
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:49,080
Do you have any idea who attacked me up there?

80
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:51,923
No.

81
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,858
Oh, very sad.

82
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,729
It was you who woke a straight
adept attack, wasn't it, Athena?

83
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,252
A few greedy mercenaries are
no threat to ES.W.A.T., are they?

84
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,710
Have you forgotten the Bioroid's primary mission?

85
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,482
If the military finds out,

86
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:33,035
support for the General will grow.

87
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:37,411
General Uranus is beyond our control now.

88
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:41,036
And the limit of Gaia's tolerance
may have been reached.

89
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:42,651
Athena,

90
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:47,222
the little time we have left is running out.

91
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:57,418
Nike!

92
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:05,945
We have a leak.

93
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,627
I'm sorry, Prime Minister.

94
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:10,645
Nike,

95
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,876
I wanna covered investigation of ES.W.A.T.

96
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:14,996
I'll arrange it immediately.

97
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:18,182
We barely averted a total disaster.

98
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,844
It's lucky for us they didn't find it.

99
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:24,835
Then you mean...

100
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:29,403
Looks like they didn't do anything rash
like a full cerebral scan.

101
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:34,781
But still we'd be fools to believe this was over.

102
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:39,264
I want you to make sure I have Deunan Knute!

103
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:40,309
Yes, Ma'am!

104
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:53,815
What a strange creature is Man that
he would choose to cage himself so willingly.

105
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:23,308
It is indeed an honor to have you
here in person, Colonel Hades.

106
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:28,084
As we speak the members of ES.W.A.T.
are desperately chasing a decoy.

107
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:31,960
Your body is nearly complete, Sir,

108
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:35,586
for assembly stands at 98 percent.

109
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:41,774
Magnificent...

110
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,056
The special parts requests weren't easy to come by.

111
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:50,024
but rest's assured. They can never be traced.

112
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,004
General Uranus will be pleased.

113
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,203
It begins.

114
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,250
The Bioroids will no longer have their way.

115
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:11,828
Yes, I agree, but that does not
change business circumstances.

116
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,903
Our goal is to protect the sheep not the wolves.

117
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:20,095
First generation Bioroids like Athena
lack sufficient restraints.

118
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,495
It would seem the proverbial wolf has
donned itself in sheep's clothing.

119
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,219
True.

120
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,423
But whether wolf or sheep, we cannot
allow a single person to be hurt.

121
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,415
It is useless.

122
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,229
The outcome's known.
It's always been acknowledged.

123
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:42,419
Not even so, that is all the more reason to continue our debate.

124
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:43,624
Agreed.

125
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:47,812
Let us resume our consultation with Gaia.

126
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:12,600
Deunan!

127
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:20,647
Briareos!

128
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:58,118
Good morning, Deunan.

129
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:12,882
You look terrific.

130
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:14,349
Hop in.

131
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,448
Your immigration papers were finalized this morning.

132
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,210
You are now an official citizen of Olympus.

133
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:35,650
It's beautiful, isn't it?

134
00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:38,895
Considering where I was until yesterday,

135
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:41,431
this all seems like a mirage.

136
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,429
Well, as of today it's reality.

137
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:45,510
Everyone seems so happy.

138
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:48,869
That's because half of the city's
population is pure Bioroid.

139
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:50,186
Bioroid?

140
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:51,950
Manufactured humans.

141
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:53,173
You mean clones?

142
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:54,972
Not just ordinary clones,

143
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:58,799
but an advanced hybrid species made
from the highest quality components.

144
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,286
Let me get this straight.

145
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:02,540
The whole city is run by just clones?

146
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:04,975
Pardon me, but "just clones"...?

147
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:07,746
You didn't know I was the Bioroid too, did you?

148
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,774
What!?

149
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:11,923
Meanwhile our composition maybe superior to yours,

150
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,713
Bioroids in no way attempt to control human beings.

151
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:18,852
Our role is to stabilize an otherwise
turbulent human society.

152
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,314
We're facilitators of balance and peace.

153
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:24,587
Half the city is Bioroid...

154
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,565
This car seems sort of strange.

155
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:36,901
It has one of the new prototype
Damysos systems installed.

156
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:38,400
Meaning what?

157
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:40,304
It's a floating car.

158
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,104
Live long enough and you'll see everything I guess.

159
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,512
They've achieved gravity control
through high frequency oscillation?

160
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:48,897
And you control it by the steering wheel, right?

161
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:52,881
Everything has cyborg sensors
now just like this car.

162
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:57,043
The basis of our modern design is
"human-centered and user-friendly".

163
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:01,570
"Conceptual simplicity, structural complexity

164
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:04,068
achieves the greater state of humanity."

165
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:05,213
Right?

166
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,113
What is that?

167
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:10,474
It's the Central Planning Bureau's
model for Olympus design

168
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:13,095
the City Maintenance Department swears by.

169
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:15,368
And there's the shining symbol:

170
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:17,168
Tartarus and Daedalus.

171
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:21,239
Inside those two amazing structures
is the enormous I.N. brain

172
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:23,257
which runs all of Olympus.

173
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:24,294
I.N.?

174
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:25,859
"Intelligence Network".

175
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:27,398
We nicknamed it Gaia.

176
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:33,382
Gaia is the self-expanding network that
monitors all aspects of daily life here in the city.

177
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:37,045
Mainly our Bioroid interaction...

178
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:38,277
With human beings?

179
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:41,524
Correct. Humans are ruled by unstable emotions.

180
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:44,369
Their inherent anger often leads to war.

181
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:47,751
But in Bioroids emotional reactions are suppressed.

182
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,023
We harbor no anger or jealousy
towards other people.

183
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,960
And that's how we've been able to the peace.

184
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:58,278
However at the top of Tartarus
is a virus tank called "D-Tank"

185
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,681
which is guarded by the ultimate
system in high-tech security.

186
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:05,286
If the virus was ever released,
it would wipe out all Bioroid existence.

187
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:09,169
I know it's man's need for self-preservation,

188
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,326
but that doesn't make it any less insulting.

189
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:13,903
Meaning humans pose the bigger threat?

190
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:16,949
I mean it's vital to maintain a balance between us.

191
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:21,470
That's why Gaia also monitors
the emotional effect of Bioroids on humans.

192
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:25,038
In other words it makes sure we
humans don't get out of line.

193
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,353
You're starting to sound like General Uranus.

194
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:28,179
Who's that?

195
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,549
Commander of the Olympus Regular Army

196
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:33,358
And an extremist to the highest order.

197
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,402
He opposes all Bioroids.

198
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:38,122
Sounds like Utopia isn't the General's cup of tea.

199
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:41,885
The Olympus governing body
is comprised entirely of Bioroids.

200
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,995
Prime Minister Athena is one as well.

201
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,326
Athena?

202
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:48,066
Athena...

203
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:49,825
Oh, have the two of you met before?

204
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,906
I don't see how we could have.

205
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:57,284
I guess you could say she is
our Commander-in-Chief.

206
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,154
Although humans are still in charge of the military.

207
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:01,760
Kinda scary, huh?

208
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:06,728
Anyway ES.W.A.T. is led by Prime Minister Athena
under the authority of the Administration.

209
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:09,679
It's almost grown into an army onto itself.

210
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,634
And that's not winning her
any friends with the regular army.

211
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:16,806
Of course neither one of them has
final authority over Olympus.

212
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,198
That's entrusted to Gaia.

213
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,458
Hm, what's wrong?

214
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:22,132
We're being followed.

215
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:18,132
Hitomi, are you hurt?

216
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,072
I'm all right.

217
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:20,993
But it's not over...

218
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,403
Not too friendly looking, are they?

219
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,801
If I had to I'd guess they are after me.

220
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:32,793
Good guess.

221
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:34,862
Yup, this is reality, all right.

222
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:17,058
Briareos!

223
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,152
The Appleseed seal must never be unlocked.

224
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:06,500
Hello, Elders, how are you feeling?

225
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:10,117
Hitomi, thank goodness you're safe.

226
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:11,731
You weren't hurt, were you?

227
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:14,741
I'm fine. No need to worry.

228
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:16,095
They're so protective.

229
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,575
Anyway, here she is, Ms. Deunan Knute.

230
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:25,688
The rumors of your beauty do not do your justice.

231
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,099
The Goddess of War.

232
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:30,091
How lovely, you have your father's eyes.

233
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,166
Excuse me, but did you know my father?

234
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,475
Well, of course, my dear.

235
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:37,022
Everyone knows about the great Colonel Knute.

236
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:42,297
Most Bioroids in Olympus carry a trace
of Carl's DNA within their systems.

237
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:46,343
Which makes you and Hitomi
almost like sisters, genetically speaking.

238
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:49,004
We regret what happened to you earlier...

239
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:51,477
and so soon after your arrival.

240
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:53,426
A sign of the times.

241
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:57,547
Violence against those from
the outside world has risen lately.

242
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:02,399
Some fear our society is losing its delicate balance.

243
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:06,137
Later. Let us first introduce you to Gaia.

244
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,043
I heard there had been some excitement.

245
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:32,640
The Legislature and the Administration are at odds.

246
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,682
This dispute only proves how arrogant
the Bioroids have become.

247
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:40,448
Are you certain Prime Minister Athena
is searching for Carl's daughter?

248
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:41,678
Absolutely, Sir.

249
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:44,920
Everything stands at the ready.

250
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:47,353
How reliable is our intelligence?

251
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:49,372
Extremely. Level 5.

252
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:53,306
General, we need a decision!

253
00:31:58,402 --> 00:32:01,808
I will never allow humans to become living tools.

254
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:17,698
So, this is Gaia...

255
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:23,443
Gaia was designed to be a self-propagating network

256
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,975
which oversees and administers all of Olympus.

257
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:32,929
You see, the well of Olympus is decided through
debate between Gaia and the Seven Elders.

258
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:39,860
Gaia is a composite system, a collection of wisdom
and acumen of the scientists who designed it.

259
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:42,830
But in the end it's still a machine.

260
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,779
Perfect in its stability.

261
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,807
It will never waver.

262
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:51,792
In other words it has no emotion or
compassion for human sentiment.

263
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:57,298
By adding our seven minds to
its collective understanding of humanity

264
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:00,480
we give Gaia's thinking a measure of flexibility.

265
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,646
However, lately all you seem to do is to disagree with it.

266
00:33:05,436 --> 00:33:07,796
It is our duty as a counsel

267
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:11,619
to ensure an ongoing dialog between us and Gaia.

268
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:15,506
The results of our continuing conversation with each other

269
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:18,972
sets Olympus on the proper path towards the future.

270
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:24,162
Till yesterday you were on the battlefield,
weren't you, Deunan?

271
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:26,041
Please tell us

272
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,951
what were you fighting for?

273
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,488
Well, I...

274
00:33:32,353 --> 00:33:37,920
Understand, as long as we allow desire to rule us the war will never end.

275
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,299
It's inevitable

276
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:42,341
building Olympus was the only solution.

277
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:46,940
Coexistence between man and Bioroid

278
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,788
is the last remaining hope
for the survivals of our species.

279
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:55,098
And Gaia is ever watchful of that balance.

280
00:33:55,483 --> 00:34:00,005
Bioroids are vastly different life forms from human beings.

281
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,974
The reproductive functions remain inactive,
so they can produce no offspring.

282
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:07,211
In other words, no sex.

283
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:11,323
And sense emotions such as love and hate are controlled.

284
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:12,323
Desire and entity are almost not existent.

285
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:16,655
However,

286
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,974
because Bioroids cannot reproduce organically

287
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,686
they must undergo a periodic life extension process.

288
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:28,300
If not, their bodies will age rapidly
and die within a matter of hours.

289
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:33,448
This is how we differentiated the Bioroid species from our own.

290
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:36,405
By suppressing reproductive function

291
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:39,104
and altering their life cycles.

292
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:41,061
Hitomi,

293
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,767
aren't you overdue for a life extension process yourself?

294
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:47,584
Don't you worry.

295
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:50,386
I'll have the procedure done within the next few days.

296
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,819
That's good.

297
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:55,838
I hope someday you won't have to go to all that trouble.

298
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,016
Kudoh,

299
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:59,157
your entire unit's been wiped out.

300
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:09,667
Not bad at all... for beginners.

301
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:19,663
She started with only a knife and within
10 minutes took out 16 of our men.

302
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:23,216
That's one hell of a rookie you brought me.

303
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:33,323
So...

304
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:35,024
You proud of yourself?

305
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:42,123
Did it ever occurred to you that one of those
beginners might just save your life someday?

306
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:45,056
You should show them some respect.

307
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,640
Is that all you can say to me after we've been apart for so long?

308
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,567
Can’t you at least try to say something nice?

309
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:12,368
Like "how you been for the last few years?" or...

310
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,062
"it's great to see you again"!

311
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:15,827
Your life is in danger.

312
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:17,402
Don't you think I know that?

313
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:20,427
But the question is why. Who's behind this?

314
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,144
I don't know.

315
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:24,034
And what the hell is "Appleseed"?

316
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,287
I don't know.

317
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:28,104
Stop answering me like a damn machine!

318
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:33,906
I'm sorry.

319
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:47,189
My mission is to make sure that nothing happens to you.

320
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:49,732
Your mission?..

321
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:52,531
See you tomorrow at 9.

322
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:41,035
They didn't tell us we got our asses kicked by the legendary lady-warrior Deunan Knute.

323
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,373
I heard you were killed in battle.

324
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:47,138
People are still talking about how badass you were during the last Global War.

325
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,607
May I join you?

326
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:57,619
Go ahead.

327
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:00,693
Deunan,

328
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:02,791
your father...

329
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:05,640
What's he been you to all these years?

330
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:08,230
He died from an illness before the War.

331
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:09,274
Oh...

332
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:11,543
What about your mother?

333
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:13,330
I don't know. I can't remember.

334
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:16,057
My father didn't talk about her that much.

335
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,002
So, tell me

336
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:24,884
you and Briareos used to be lovers, right?

337
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,396
He was still flesh and blood back then, so to speak.

338
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:31,429
I guess looks count for a lot in love, ha?

339
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:33,859
That isn't what I meant at all.

340
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,248
It's a shame really.

341
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,385
He's still a man inside.

342
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:42,622
Deunan...

343
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:47,231
What's it like to be in love?

344
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:48,476
What?

345
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,213
Bioroids were design with a limited capacity for emotion, remember?

346
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,240
We don't know how it feels to really be in love.

347
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:59,347
Of course, I can understand it on the intellectual level,

348
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:01,871
but love has little to do with intellect.

349
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:04,500
It's emotion.

350
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:07,103
That's what makes it so fascinating.

351
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,696
I know it's silly,

352
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:12,791
but it's the one thing I envy about humans.

353
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:19,432
I always think it must be wonderful.

354
00:40:21,942 --> 00:40:24,095
To feel what love is like.

355
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,298
How dare you!

356
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:30,450
You got a lot of nerve

357
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,047
- talking to a human that way, Bioroid!
- I'm sorry, I was only...

358
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:35,923
Olympus Regular Army.

359
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,280
Anger...

360
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:39,897
That's one emotion I don't envy.

361
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:41,748
<i>What? Say something!</i>

362
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:32,548
Operation check complete.

363
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,736
This baby's ready for a test drive.

364
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,821
Once I adjust the cockpit settings, she's all yours.

365
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:40,883
Before she is, maybe you could clear something up for me.

366
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:44,101
Why are shock absorbers in the tendon sheath so minimum?

367
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:46,381
As I explained before so brilliantly,

368
00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:49,898
All forceful impact is absorbed directly through power train.

369
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:53,249
But there're plenty of cartilage units for enhanced mobility,

370
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:58,774
a magnetic fluid used in the triaxial joints as well as
oscillating bearings allow for precise sensory control.

371
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:02,497
Don't get too crazy with it, though.
Or you could really get hurt.

372
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:06,106
Relax, Yoshi, Deunan isn't someone you have to be worried about.

373
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,895
I'm not. It's just that I've never seen a woman handle a Landmate before.

374
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:11,096
No offence.

375
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,832
None taken. Why don't you adjust the seat, ok?

376
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,105
Deunan, you're at good hands.

377
00:42:29,106 --> 00:42:31,144
Yoshi is the best mechanic in Olympus.

378
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:33,512
As far as Landmates are concerned.

379
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:37,011
But lately his passion's been for Hecatonchires units.

380
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:39,089
Next time you gotta let me peak under the hood.

381
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:41,052
I think, I'll pass.

382
00:42:41,414 --> 00:42:42,911
I'm... kinda shy.

383
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:55,589
So, you feel secure?

384
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:56,542
Hm, it's fine.

385
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,603
All right.

386
00:42:58,111 --> 00:43:00,125
This is the ignition sequence for the engines.

387
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,480
Start around slowly.

388
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:09,899
Try to get the feel for it.

389
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:11,963
That's good.

390
00:43:24,473 --> 00:43:27,449
<i>State of emergency. Scramble order.</i>

391
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:31,506
What is it?

392
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:32,897
That's the Code Red alert.

393
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:41,951
<i>Unidentified Landmates have infiltrated the Bioroid Care Center!</i>

394
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,898
<i>Multiple targets!</i>

395
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:46,421
<i>ES.W.A.T. units 104, 106,107!</i>

396
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:50,699
<i>Employ Landmates, encrypt with D-types and proceed to BCC stage immediately!</i>

397
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,440
<i>Repeat.</i>

398
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:54,915
<i>Unidentified Landmates have infiltrated the Bioroid Care Center!</i>

399
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,211
<i>Multiple targets!</i>

400
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:59,635
<i>ES.W.A.T. units 104, 106,107!</i>

401
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:01,362
Are you gonna stand here all day?

402
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:04,696
Forget it! I'm going in this!

403
00:44:04,986 --> 00:44:06,412
What?! Are you crazy?

404
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:09,636
Deunan!

405
00:45:05,689 --> 00:45:06,647
Stop the tank!

406
00:45:17,377 --> 00:45:18,332
They're close!

407
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:45,479
How to aim this thing?

408
00:45:58,988 --> 00:45:59,854
Deunan!

409
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:17,416
No! Get out of here!

410
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,341
Dismount! Now!

411
00:47:02,563 --> 00:47:03,396
Deunan!

412
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:32,162
Briareos.

413
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,314
Sorry.

414
00:48:13,906 --> 00:48:16,054
How could they do something so foolish?

415
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:19,004
All third-gen Bioroids have been destroyed.

416
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,371
The fire wiped out all original DNA for life extension as well.

417
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:27,538
The perpetrators gained access from a subterranean elevator shaft.

418
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:30,716
And one by one cleared all seven security points.

419
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:33,907
Olympus perimeter shows no trace of entry.

420
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:36,452
Landmate origin is unknown.

421
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,573
I underestimated them.

422
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:41,808
Alas...

423
00:48:42,265 --> 00:48:45,709
I seems our destiny is to bear the sins of all humanity.

424
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:49,225
There's only one option left to us now.

425
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:54,796
I want the perimeter around Tartarus and Daedalus sealed off at once.

426
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:58,656
No one gets close to D-Tank without my approval, understood?

427
00:48:58,735 --> 00:48:59,724
Yes, Ma'am!

428
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:01,970
I'll arrange an emergency session at Congress.

429
00:49:06,437 --> 00:49:08,167
I hope Deunan's all right.

430
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:10,416
Hitomi!

431
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:13,511
Oh, no!

432
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:19,189
Your life extension procedure...

433
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,563
You were due three days ago!

434
00:49:21,904 --> 00:49:23,434
Hitomi! Hitomi!

435
00:49:24,023 --> 00:49:25,849
Hitomi! Hitomi!

436
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:38,198
<i>We have yet to identify the Landmates who attacked the Care Center</i>

437
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:40,217
<i>or the location of their manufacturer.</i>

438
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:45,492
<i>That's the extend of the information ES.W.A.T. has about the incident at this time.</i>

439
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:47,952
<i>I urge all Bioroids:</i>

440
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:51,031
<i>Please, remain calm through this trial.</i>

441
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:56,369
We are currently exploring every alternative method for life extension.

442
00:49:57,066 --> 00:50:00,083
Remember, panic will only worsen our cause.

443
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:02,748
<i>Prime Minister Athena,</i>

444
00:50:03,145 --> 00:50:06,280
by having ES.W.A.T. seal off Tartarus and Daedalus,

445
00:50:06,494 --> 00:50:09,672
have you not exceeded your authority as Prime Minister?

446
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,950
The situation necessitate near-martial law conditions.

447
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,928
Our duty now is the protection of Gaia.

448
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,926
And not the D-Tank?

449
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,673
Gaia must be secured.

450
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:28,333
Without the aid of the Regular Army?

451
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:31,586
General, I stand by my decision.

452
00:50:32,102 --> 00:50:33,596
What are you saying?!

453
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:36,289
Are you trying to humiliate us?!

454
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:40,283
General, please, we do not have the time for this sort of petty scrabbling.

455
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:42,730
Now then...

456
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,108
Congressmen of Olympus.

457
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,344
This terrorist act was an attempted Bioroid genocide.

458
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:52,767
It has rocked the foundation of our society.

459
00:50:53,882 --> 00:50:55,531
As it presently stands,

460
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:58,211
the future of all Bioroid life

461
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:00,993
has been destroyed by this catastrophe.

462
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:02,794
However,

463
00:51:03,236 --> 00:51:05,064
hope still exists.

464
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:08,860
There's yet a way to ensure the survival of their race.

465
00:51:09,296 --> 00:51:12,032
A permanent form of life extension.

466
00:51:12,454 --> 00:51:16,338
Its implementation will save Olympus from this calamity.

467
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:18,224
For a long time

468
00:51:18,647 --> 00:51:23,027
the Elders have been discussing the pros and cons of this method with Gaia.

469
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:27,242
Finally, after much deliberation

470
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:29,721
Gaia has made its decision.

471
00:51:31,562 --> 00:51:32,684
So be it.

472
00:51:33,118 --> 00:51:35,458
As a solution to this crisis

473
00:51:35,854 --> 00:51:39,692
we will restore all Bioroid reproductive functions.

474
00:51:40,082 --> 00:51:40,918
What!?

475
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:56,784
I was my understanding that the technological data

476
00:51:56,785 --> 00:51:59,475
needed to reactivate such functions in Bioroids

477
00:51:59,475 --> 00:52:02,070
have been destroyed by its inventor Dr. Gilliam.

478
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:05,527
Which would make recovering the original data impossible.

479
00:52:06,328 --> 00:52:08,384
Your understanding is correct.

480
00:52:09,122 --> 00:52:13,048
The original data would indeed be impossible to recover.

481
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:15,725
Had it actually been destroyed?

482
00:52:16,214 --> 00:52:17,303
However,

483
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:22,091
it is recently come to our attention that Dr. Gilliam's data,

484
00:52:22,414 --> 00:52:24,744
which we have named "Appleseed",

485
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:26,840
is still in existence.

486
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:29,401
<i>We are confident</i>

487
00:52:29,587 --> 00:52:33,752
<i>that our attempt in retrieving the lost Appleseed will be successful.</i>

488
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:35,777
<i>Once found</i>

489
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:40,035
<i>Bioroid reproductive capabilities will be restored.</i>

490
00:52:40,212 --> 00:52:43,497
<i>They will evolve into a new race of Man</i>

491
00:52:43,498 --> 00:52:47,178
<i>and create a shining paradise for us all!</i>

492
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,220
Hitomi!

493
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:11,009
Do not worry.

494
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:12,893
She is merely asleep.

495
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:14,838
Will you be able to save her?

496
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:18,624
If we can find Appleseed, Hitomi will recover.

497
00:53:18,948 --> 00:53:20,646
What will happen if you don't?

498
00:53:21,209 --> 00:53:23,567
She will age at an alarming rate.

499
00:53:23,713 --> 00:53:26,732
Her life functions will cease in 24 hours.

500
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,466
It's not just Hitomi.

501
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:34,162
An accelerating death is the fate awaiting all Bioroids.

502
00:53:34,163 --> 00:53:35,490
Including myself.

503
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:43,219
I'm Athena Areios, Prime Minister of Olympus.

504
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:45,720
You must be Deunan Knute.

505
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,146
Deunan.

506
00:53:49,915 --> 00:53:52,984
Have you heard of the scientist Dr. Gilliam?

507
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:54,336
No.

508
00:53:54,904 --> 00:53:59,242
We've been conducting our own research for over twenty years now

509
00:53:59,377 --> 00:54:04,443
and have yet to surpass the late Doctor's achievement in Bioroid technology.

510
00:54:04,837 --> 00:54:05,694
True.

511
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:10,176
But if we acquire the Appleseed data Dr. Gilliam developed

512
00:54:10,275 --> 00:54:14,481
organic reproduction will be restored to their species.

513
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:18,062
They'll be freed from the lumen fear of the D-Tank

514
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:21,222
and become new, eternal race of mankind.

515
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:27,618
Indeed, Gaia has made its decision.

516
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,459
Now, Athena,

517
00:54:32,488 --> 00:54:35,551
it is time for you to make yours.

518
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:45,180
Deunan.

519
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:48,603
I'm going to need your help to find it.

520
00:55:11,604 --> 00:55:14,172
So, this old disc is the only clue we've got?

521
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:19,823
We're heading for the lab where the first generation of Bioroids was created, right?

522
00:55:20,282 --> 00:55:21,527
That's what they told me.

523
00:55:21,824 --> 00:55:25,964
If Athena had the disc, why do you think she kept it secret all this time?

524
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,081
And if Bioroid reproduction is so important

525
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:36,299
why would Dr. Gilliam wanna seal away the original data?

526
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,070
Deunan, listen...

527
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:41,520
this is a highly classified mission that's gonna put us all at risk.

528
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:45,419
If completing it will save Hitomi's life, isn't that enough?

529
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:48,889
Just stay focused on her and try not to think too much.

530
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:51,513
Everything else is only a distraction.

531
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:54,598
Mind if I ask one more question?

532
00:55:55,717 --> 00:55:56,402
Yeah.

533
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,813
That last shot you fired at the terrorist...

534
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,691
Did you...

535
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:05,537
No, just forget it. Never mind.

536
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,637
Deunan! Leyton, over here.

537
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:18,325
This must what we're looking for.

538
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,138
Kudoh, get back!

539
00:58:56,374 --> 00:58:58,612
Dr. Gilliam, there's no time!

540
00:58:59,155 --> 00:59:00,717
- You've got to get out of here!
- Athena...

541
00:59:01,101 --> 00:59:03,829
Just give me a second. I have to destroy it.

542
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:08,191
I'll try to hold them on the first floor. But you have to hurry!

543
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:19,810
Mommy.

544
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:26,097
What's wrong, honey? Did we wake you up?

545
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:36,789
Oh, my God...

546
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:39,763
What is it, Deunan?

547
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:44,615
It's her...

548
01:00:05,778 --> 01:00:08,219
Deunan, listen very carefully.

549
01:00:09,236 --> 01:00:10,804
You see this pendant?

550
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:14,612
Mommy's very important research data is inside of it.

551
01:00:15,106 --> 01:00:18,071
But there're some very bad people out there.

552
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:21,637
And if they find it they'll use it to do some very bad things.

553
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:24,110
That's why I'm hiding it in this.

554
01:00:24,678 --> 01:00:26,329
So they'll never find it.

555
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,664
The bad people want it?

556
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:29,521
Yes.

557
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:32,349
They want to take away your future.

558
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:33,729
You understand?

559
01:00:35,183 --> 01:00:36,885
That's why I'm giving it to you,

560
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,193
so you can keep it safe.

561
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:42,445
Okay, don't worry, mommy.

562
01:00:43,847 --> 01:00:44,907
Good girl.

563
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:55,798
Deunan,

564
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:57,753
one more thing.

565
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,974
If Athena ever asks you for it,

566
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:03,260
I want you to give the pendant to her, all right?

567
01:01:04,406 --> 01:01:06,179
Athena is very special.

568
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:10,240
I understand. Athena is very special.

569
01:01:15,388 --> 01:01:16,424
Deunan,

570
01:01:16,988 --> 01:01:19,104
you must protect the Appleseed.

571
01:01:34,636 --> 01:01:36,905
Deunan, you remember now, don't you?

572
01:01:37,231 --> 01:01:38,182
Where is it?

573
01:01:38,218 --> 01:01:39,619
Where did she hide the data?

574
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:44,177
Carl's gun...

575
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:45,889
that pendant...

576
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:48,744
And Appleseed's inside of it, isn't it?

577
01:02:06,887 --> 01:02:08,787
Dr. Gilliam, I presume.

578
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:12,024
Stay where you are. We don't want to hurt you.

579
01:02:18,082 --> 01:02:18,955
Don't do it!..

580
01:02:21,441 --> 01:02:23,492
Please, for God's sake, don't...

581
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,783
Mommy. What's wrong, mommy?

582
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,674
Deunan, stay out!

583
01:02:33,093 --> 01:02:35,232
No! Don't shoot!

584
01:04:06,917 --> 01:04:08,754
What the hell... It's the Army!

585
01:04:09,062 --> 01:04:10,028
Come in hot!

586
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:13,235
How did they know about this?

587
01:04:15,277 --> 01:04:18,291
They've got the deck surrounded. We're gonna find another way out.

588
01:04:19,513 --> 01:04:21,350
There's only one way straightaway to the roof.

589
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:23,142
We can cut out them from there.

590
01:04:28,438 --> 01:04:31,712
Sorry, guys, but I can't let you do that.

591
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:35,934
We're in Lab D, Level 5.

592
01:04:36,116 --> 01:04:37,441
You're son of a bitch!

593
01:04:38,194 --> 01:04:39,501
You betrayed us!

594
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:42,432
What can I say. I've always hated Bioroids.

595
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:51,206
Besides,

596
01:04:51,413 --> 01:04:53,745
the real traitor is right there.

597
01:04:56,569 --> 01:04:57,525
Hades.

598
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:01,308
Deunan, how nice to see you.

599
01:05:02,628 --> 01:05:06,039
I only wish I'd had the honor of killing your father.

600
01:05:09,393 --> 01:05:12,298
You've got the stink of Bioroid all over you, you know that?

601
01:05:16,518 --> 01:05:20,482
What a nice surprise to see you and Briareos together again.

602
01:05:21,077 --> 01:05:24,338
Of course, he's not the man he used to be, right?

603
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:29,278
I got fed up with those old fossils and their terrorist farce.

604
01:05:29,683 --> 01:05:30,654
Well...

605
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:34,760
Lucky for us you made the classic mistake of trusting your subordinates.

606
01:05:34,761 --> 01:05:36,074
What a fool.

607
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:38,509
Briareos, what's he talking about?

608
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:41,057
Let me spell it out for you, Deunan.

609
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:46,958
The attack on the Bioroid Care Center was aided by none other then Briareos.

610
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:50,332
Don't look so surprised.

611
01:05:50,734 --> 01:05:53,486
You saw how easily he let my Landmate escape, didn't you?

612
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:58,356
And thanks to him, every last Bioroid is going to die.

613
01:05:58,701 --> 01:05:59,737
Is this true?

614
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:04,497
Well, go on, answer her!

615
01:06:05,398 --> 01:06:07,249
Legislature patsy.

616
01:06:15,734 --> 01:06:16,649
Now.

617
01:06:17,128 --> 01:06:19,578
I'll take that pendant, if you please.

618
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:34,482
Deunan!

619
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:36,115
Get to the roof!

620
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:37,362
Let's go!

621
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:55,783
- Kudoh!
- Come on!

622
01:07:23,077 --> 01:07:23,932
Stay back!

623
01:07:24,371 --> 01:07:25,898
Don't come any closer!

624
01:07:27,634 --> 01:07:30,764
Deunan, please, you have to give me that pendant.

625
01:07:33,157 --> 01:07:35,438
As long as you have it you'll never be safe!

626
01:07:37,075 --> 01:07:39,938
My mother gave her life to protect this and so will I!

627
01:07:45,859 --> 01:07:48,202
You knew it all along, didn't you?

628
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,669
You knew everything!

629
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:53,103
Deunan.

630
01:07:59,305 --> 01:08:00,226
Deunan!

631
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:04,296
Now you see what he is. What kind of monster he has become.

632
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:13,984
Deunan Knute.

633
01:08:14,867 --> 01:08:19,001
I am Edward Uranus III, Commander of the Regular Army.

634
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,814
Your father, Carl Knute, and I were comrades.

635
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:25,435
And I knew Dr. Gilliam very well.

636
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:28,595
We met on many occasions when you were young.

637
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:29,984
Deunan,

638
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,838
you must understand we have no intention of harming you.

639
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:36,814
We only wish to see that data destroyed.

640
01:08:42,943 --> 01:08:46,169
Our goal is to regain control of the Legislature,

641
01:08:46,228 --> 01:08:50,267
destroy the D-Tank thus ridding the world of Bioroids.

642
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:51,954
When that's achieved

643
01:08:52,057 --> 01:08:55,303
society will once again be under human control.

644
01:08:55,929 --> 01:08:59,829
The only thing standing in the way of our success is that data.

645
01:09:00,397 --> 01:09:04,373
Now, please, would you hand it over without further incidents?

646
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:06,752
Request denied!

647
01:09:07,424 --> 01:09:08,258
Deunan!

648
01:09:12,078 --> 01:09:13,051
Deunan.

649
01:09:14,072 --> 01:09:17,272
Olympus was supposed to be a utopia for mankind

650
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:20,321
but the world your parents envisioned for us has failed.

651
01:09:20,418 --> 01:09:24,792
All those years the only thing my father ever taught me how to do is how to fight.

652
01:09:25,516 --> 01:09:29,810
It's funny. I never understood why he pushed me so hard to become a soldier.

653
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:33,038
But he forged me into warrior for a reason.

654
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:34,242
General,

655
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:38,748
as my mother instructed, I will give this data only to Athena.

656
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:42,405
And by doing so you will seal our fate.

657
01:09:42,823 --> 01:09:46,442
You mustn't trust Bioroids. They want to control us!

658
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,824
Maybe you're right.

659
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:49,931
Maybe they can't be trusted.

660
01:09:51,598 --> 01:09:54,142
But after what I've seen I know this much:

661
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,837
Bioroids don't try to kill each other!

662
01:10:05,294 --> 01:10:07,976
General, you're wasting your time.

663
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:16,906
You're right.

664
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:19,283
What a pity.

665
01:10:21,724 --> 01:10:24,512
Athena is trying to protect our society.

666
01:10:24,903 --> 01:10:26,970
Carl and Dr. Gilliam gave their lives

667
01:10:26,971 --> 01:10:29,607
trying to hide Appleseed for the sake of humanity.

668
01:10:30,044 --> 01:10:33,727
They both feared what would happen when the Bioroids were activated.

669
01:10:35,115 --> 01:10:38,029
Because the Bioroids represent a threat to our race.

670
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:39,520
No.

671
01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:44,409
Athena honored Dr. Gilliam's request to keep their reproductive systems inactive.

672
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:49,913
General...

673
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,513
The Bioroids' purpose is to safeguard our species.

674
01:10:58,287 --> 01:10:59,202
Deunan,

675
01:10:59,203 --> 01:11:03,254
I cooperated with Hades and the terrorist attack to force Athena's hand.

676
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:07,726
I knew she would have no choice but to fully activate the Bioroids.

677
01:11:08,137 --> 01:11:12,484
She'd been hiding the key that would unlock your memory of Appleseed's location.

678
01:11:13,066 --> 01:11:16,365
Your memory was long repressed by the shock of your mother's death.

679
01:11:17,421 --> 01:11:20,382
It was my duty to deliver Appleseed to the Elders.

680
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:25,083
And in return, they would guarantee your safety.

681
01:11:26,879 --> 01:11:27,916
Don't you see?

682
01:11:28,453 --> 01:11:31,381
That's all the more reason you have that pendant destroyed.

683
01:11:31,874 --> 01:11:34,835
But, General, there's more going on here.

684
01:11:35,339 --> 01:11:38,765
The Elders don't simply want to get their hand on the Appleseed data.

685
01:11:39,724 --> 01:11:42,670
They needed you and the Regular Army to attempt a coup.

686
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:45,249
They want you to blow up the D-Tank.

687
01:11:47,376 --> 01:11:51,723
There must be some reason why Athena is so desperate to prevent that from happening.

688
01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:56,502
General, please, D-Tank must not be destroyed!

689
01:12:01,132 --> 01:12:02,518
No, Briareos!

690
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:03,954
I've heard enough.

691
01:12:04,676 --> 01:12:07,857
And I'll be damned if I let some machine tell us what to do!

692
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,502
This is vengeance, Deunan!

693
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:21,425
It was your father who kicked me out of the LA S.W.A.T.

694
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:25,223
Do you know how many years of humiliation I suffered because of him?!

695
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,842
Finally!

696
01:12:27,228 --> 01:12:30,259
I get to pay him back for all the misery he caused.

697
01:12:31,077 --> 01:12:33,914
His DNA is inside of everyone of those things!

698
01:12:34,714 --> 01:12:36,389
When the Bioroids are dead,

699
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,000
Carl's legacy will be erased!

700
01:12:39,795 --> 01:12:40,765
Hades!

701
01:12:42,888 --> 01:12:43,824
Deunan!

702
01:12:44,688 --> 01:12:47,281
If you wanna blame someone, blame your father!

703
01:13:54,255 --> 01:13:55,415
Forgive me.

704
01:13:57,123 --> 01:13:58,105
Don't talk.

705
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,654
Just think they could wire me.

706
01:14:03,048 --> 01:14:04,690
Do not feel the pain.

707
01:14:05,385 --> 01:14:07,377
Would you stop trying to talk?

708
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:12,399
God, I missed you...

709
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:16,863
As I lay dying on the battlefield,

710
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:20,046
all I wanted was to see you again...

711
01:14:22,922 --> 01:14:26,123
The Elders brought me back to life...

712
01:14:34,294 --> 01:14:36,701
You were the only thing that mattered to me.

713
01:14:37,658 --> 01:14:40,450
I would've done everything to make sure you were safe...

714
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:41,870
I know that now.

715
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:46,399
I've become a monster on the inside as well.

716
01:14:46,993 --> 01:14:49,041
Don't say that. You haven't changed.

717
01:14:49,624 --> 01:14:50,906
You're still the same.

718
01:14:52,742 --> 01:14:54,821
I wanted to protect you...

719
01:14:55,428 --> 01:14:57,274
But I can't anymore...

720
01:14:58,478 --> 01:14:59,964
I won't let you die.

721
01:15:01,986 --> 01:15:03,869
Deunan, the Elders...

722
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,730
Briareos!

723
01:15:11,654 --> 01:15:14,805
The Elders promised no loss of human life.

724
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,131
But something else is going on.

725
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,703
That's why you have to go.

726
01:15:25,018 --> 01:15:25,988
Hurry!

727
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:27,922
Before it's to late...

728
01:15:28,977 --> 01:15:31,024
No, Briareos, I won't leave you.

729
01:15:32,274 --> 01:15:33,719
You have to...

730
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:36,225
The future depends on it...

731
01:15:36,318 --> 01:15:38,161
There's no future without you.

732
01:15:41,323 --> 01:15:42,012
Deunan...

733
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,751
don't let your mother's death...

734
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:46,979
be for nothing.

735
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:51,035
Please, stop trying to talk.

736
01:15:55,494 --> 01:15:56,546
Deunan...

737
01:15:57,835 --> 01:15:58,875
Briareos?

738
01:16:09,681 --> 01:16:10,814
Briareos!

739
01:17:37,939 --> 01:17:41,637
We picked up an SOS from Briareos on the secure line after he was shot.

740
01:17:54,714 --> 01:17:57,253
His Hecatonchires units are built like nothing else.

741
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,327
His system shot down in time.

742
01:17:59,616 --> 01:18:01,244
I may still be able to revive him.

743
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,353
Bring him back.

744
01:18:06,317 --> 01:18:07,293
Save him.

745
01:18:12,044 --> 01:18:14,024
Don't worry about the fuel. She's got the full tank.

746
01:18:14,297 --> 01:18:17,989
The new Landmate Damysos System makes her pretty smooth flying once you get hanging.

747
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:20,151
Just be aware that she is a little top-heavy.

748
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:23,312
If you keep you turns out of 60 degrees it shouldn't be a problem.

749
01:18:24,852 --> 01:18:25,782
Deunan...

750
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,489
Bioroid emotions might be suppressed,

751
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:32,405
but that doesn't mean that we can't feel love.

752
01:18:35,986 --> 01:18:37,321
Save Hitomi.

753
01:19:25,774 --> 01:19:28,260
Deunan Knute reporting. Mission accomplished.

754
01:19:29,278 --> 01:19:30,155
Good work.

755
01:19:51,302 --> 01:19:52,338
Deunan.

756
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:43,374
Well done, Deunan, well done!

757
01:20:43,409 --> 01:20:44,754
Thanks to you

758
01:20:44,755 --> 01:20:48,816
Bioroid reproductive functions have at last been activated.

759
01:20:48,895 --> 01:20:53,459
Hitomi's regenerative cycle is becoming like that of a human being.

760
01:20:53,596 --> 01:20:55,565
The life will be spared.

761
01:20:56,339 --> 01:20:57,463
Thank goodness.

762
01:21:00,395 --> 01:21:03,157
It's all right. There's no need to worry.

763
01:21:06,554 --> 01:21:07,429
Deunan...

764
01:21:10,802 --> 01:21:12,932
It was you who killed her, wasn't it?

765
01:21:17,849 --> 01:21:19,837
You murdered my mother, didn't you?

766
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:28,914
Deunan, please forgive us.

767
01:21:28,949 --> 01:21:31,544
Your dear mother's death was an accident.

768
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:33,539
Her research was invaluable.

769
01:21:33,774 --> 01:21:37,303
Had she been alive today we might have had other options.

770
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:41,388
If that's the case then why she had to hide the Appleseed data?

771
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:46,594
Understand. Her work gave us a chance of survival.

772
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:51,872
Bioroids. A new form of life that could help us save our own.

773
01:21:52,414 --> 01:21:53,974
Man was doomed,

774
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:56,992
but coexistence with this new species

775
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:57,992
gave us all a glimmer of hope.

776
01:22:00,823 --> 01:22:01,851
Even so,

777
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:06,141
human race could not suppress its violent nature.

778
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:09,277
Mankind despises those that are different.

779
01:22:09,312 --> 01:22:12,783
Once again he's come to hatred and anger.

780
01:22:12,918 --> 01:22:17,345
And fear. He no longer has the ability to maintain this planet.

781
01:22:17,903 --> 01:22:22,462
Human nature has caused the abuse of Dr. Gilliam's vision.

782
01:22:23,343 --> 01:22:25,919
Gaia has made an accurate prediction

783
01:22:26,327 --> 01:22:29,851
that the human race is doomed to annihilate itself

784
01:22:29,852 --> 01:22:33,781
and destroy the world in three generations.

785
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:35,152
Deunan...

786
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,873
Our time has passed.

787
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:41,901
The human race must step aside.

788
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,461
Step aside?

789
01:22:44,123 --> 01:22:46,083
If the world is to survive

790
01:22:46,184 --> 01:22:50,589
we have no choice but to relinquish its future to the Bioroids.

791
01:22:50,604 --> 01:22:54,209
Dr. Gilliam spent many months creating a virus.

792
01:22:54,615 --> 01:22:58,047
The time has finally come for it to serve its purpose.

793
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:00,148
The virus my mother created?

794
01:23:05,592 --> 01:23:06,465
Yes.

795
01:23:06,907 --> 01:23:11,678
It has been sealed off in D-Tank on the top of Tartarus for many years,

796
01:23:11,902 --> 01:23:14,004
waiting to be released.

797
01:23:14,966 --> 01:23:17,196
When the Tank is destroyed

798
01:23:17,476 --> 01:23:18,643
the virus

799
01:23:19,009 --> 01:23:23,521
will make the entire human race permanently infertile.

800
01:23:25,902 --> 01:23:29,424
We swore the no human life would be taken.

801
01:23:30,124 --> 01:23:31,487
And so it won't.

802
01:23:32,013 --> 01:23:35,832
Instead, we will slowly close the book on human history.

803
01:23:36,447 --> 01:23:41,130
The last chapter will be the euthanasia of mankind.

804
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:44,903
My mother must have known.

805
01:23:45,211 --> 01:23:48,792
And when she refused to fully activate the Bioroid you murdered her!

806
01:23:51,557 --> 01:23:55,507
We developed the plans for Olympus with two options in mind.

807
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:59,398
The world of Human and Bioroid coexistence

808
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:02,720
or one bequeathed to a new race.

809
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:08,160
Gaia was created to ensure that all decisions were precise and balanced.

810
01:24:08,285 --> 01:24:11,780
Dr. Gilliam contributed greatly to Gaia's creation

811
01:24:11,781 --> 01:24:15,341
instilling it with the understanding of both species.

812
01:24:15,577 --> 01:24:19,835
It was as if Gaia had inherited your mother's tenacity.

813
01:24:20,213 --> 01:24:25,125
For the virus could not be released from D-Tank by the will of Man.

814
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,541
It could only be released with Gaia's consent.

815
01:24:28,576 --> 01:24:33,111
But even utopia could not quell man's need for violence.

816
01:24:33,515 --> 01:24:37,365
Once again he became embroiled in a global war.

817
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:40,233
And reduced the world to ashes.

818
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:43,576
And now...

819
01:24:44,026 --> 01:24:48,495
Olympus too has been marched by the sins of humanity.

820
01:24:52,114 --> 01:24:53,995
The hatred of Bioroids

821
01:24:53,996 --> 01:24:57,681
that's displayed by General Uranus and the Regular Army

822
01:24:57,682 --> 01:25:00,322
has fueled Gaia's anger.

823
01:25:02,204 --> 01:25:03,624
It had no choice

824
01:25:03,837 --> 01:25:06,161
but to render this decision.

825
01:25:06,423 --> 01:25:08,415
We will use Appleseed.

826
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,874
The Bioroids will then create a new species.

827
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:17,102
And mankind will be eradicated from the planet.

828
01:25:17,622 --> 01:25:19,130
So, you used us.

829
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,470
I was simply the bait to get Briareos to do what you wanted.

830
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:32,396
It was all to force Gaia into making this decision!

831
01:25:32,748 --> 01:25:34,408
You manipulated Gaia.

832
01:25:34,725 --> 01:25:37,755
Deunan, it is humanity's destiny!

833
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:41,234
The moment I press this button

834
01:25:41,817 --> 01:25:44,534
the D-Tank on Tartarus will be destroyed

835
01:25:44,569 --> 01:25:46,578
and the virus will envelop the Earth.

836
01:25:52,723 --> 01:25:54,156
Hold it right there!

837
01:25:56,676 --> 01:25:58,843
Grid 984G, cut the power.

838
01:25:58,943 --> 01:26:01,004
We've just rendered that button inactive.

839
01:26:02,646 --> 01:26:04,533
Athena, what are you doing?

840
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,324
You seemed to have forgotten our primary function:

841
01:26:08,556 --> 01:26:10,989
to ensure the survival of the human race.

842
01:26:11,138 --> 01:26:12,380
That may be.

843
01:26:12,915 --> 01:26:16,405
But Bioroids were also programmed not to disobey us.

844
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:19,244
We are no longer the Bioroids you created,

845
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:21,277
but members of a new race.

846
01:26:22,228 --> 01:26:25,320
Athena, the will of Gaia is irrefutable!

847
01:26:25,539 --> 01:26:29,178
Its anger goes beyond General Uranus's actions

848
01:26:29,178 --> 01:26:31,912
to encompass the sins of all humanity!

849
01:26:31,912 --> 01:26:35,881
General Uranus has just surrendered. The coup d'etat is over.

850
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:38,368
He seeks a full reconciliation.

851
01:26:39,782 --> 01:26:41,033
The General surrendered?

852
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:45,813
I'm sure that Gaia is well aware of the impact of these recent events.

853
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,138
Deunan,

854
01:26:49,023 --> 01:26:51,663
the will of Gaia is not present in this room.

855
01:26:51,698 --> 01:26:52,771
But how can that be?

856
01:26:54,481 --> 01:26:56,605
Man's hatred for us has lessened.

857
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:59,494
Gaia would have sensed this and reverse its decision.

858
01:26:59,821 --> 01:27:04,040
So the Elders shut Gaia down and have been acting on their own.

859
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:06,809
How very astute of you, Athena.

860
01:27:07,007 --> 01:27:10,876
The new race of Man is wonderful indeed.

861
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:14,019
But Gaia regulates your life-support systems.

862
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:17,021
Haven't you put your own lives at risk by shutting it down?

863
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:18,564
That is correct.

864
01:27:19,009 --> 01:27:23,368
We accept the fate of our race and intend to perish along with the rest.

865
01:27:52,234 --> 01:27:53,044
Look!

866
01:27:53,403 --> 01:27:54,708
The Mobil Fortress!

867
01:28:09,329 --> 01:28:11,648
<i>The Mobil Fortress platforms have been activated.</i>

868
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:13,794
<i>They're heading to the center of Olympus!</i>

869
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:21,773
They have been programmed to destroy the D-Tank on Tartarus.

870
01:28:22,442 --> 01:28:25,280
There's nothing that can stop them now.

871
01:28:47,394 --> 01:28:48,797
Attention ES.W.A.T. units!

872
01:28:49,363 --> 01:28:52,492
<i>Equip all Landmates with Damysos systems and deploy immediately!</i>

873
01:28:52,563 --> 01:28:55,915
<i>Destroy the Mobil Fortress!
Use any means to bring them down!</i>

874
01:28:58,912 --> 01:29:01,510
I thought security around D-Tank was impenetrable.

875
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:04,986
A close range shot from one of the main gun turrets could breach the system.

876
01:29:05,436 --> 01:29:08,783
The ultimate sword versus the perfect shield.

877
01:29:09,097 --> 01:29:11,770
It's the fate of those who cling to power.

878
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:15,482
<i>At their current speed, they'll reach Tartarus in 15 minutes.</i>

879
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:16,877
Evacuate the city!

880
01:29:16,907 --> 01:29:18,306
The police have already begun.

881
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,716
That's our top priority!

882
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:23,438
Once the platforms reach unpopulated area we'll attack them on mass.

883
01:29:23,473 --> 01:29:25,264
Concentrate on platform 7.

884
01:29:25,503 --> 01:29:28,062
It's the control node for the entire Fortress.

885
01:29:28,022 --> 01:29:28,880
Hitomi!

886
01:29:30,275 --> 01:29:31,167
Hitomi...

887
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:33,006
Forgive me.

888
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:34,799
But I have no choice.

889
01:29:35,735 --> 01:29:39,967
If someone can disable the control box on the frontal cortex of No.7,

890
01:29:40,573 --> 01:29:42,772
it will shut down the rest of the platforms.

891
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:44,966
The sequence is specific.

892
01:29:45,527 --> 01:29:47,366
Destroying the box won't work.

893
01:29:47,386 --> 01:29:49,387
It has to be done manually.

894
01:29:50,386 --> 01:29:53,791
The password to shut down the system is "hitomi".

895
01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:06,263
Briareos!

896
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:08,909
You asked and I delivered.

897
01:30:09,044 --> 01:30:09,654
Well?

898
01:30:09,896 --> 01:30:12,078
Don't you stand there. Come on! Jump!

899
01:30:14,055 --> 01:30:15,279
It is futile.

900
01:30:15,295 --> 01:30:18,251
It's the fate of Man to destroy this world!

901
01:30:18,549 --> 01:30:22,345
Deunan, we've been cast from Eden and cannot return.

902
01:30:25,584 --> 01:30:28,996
So you're gonna give up and pass on our mistakes to the next race?

903
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:33,112
We may have lost our chance at Eden,

904
01:30:33,338 --> 01:30:35,275
but we have to try to survive!

905
01:30:36,797 --> 01:30:39,644
We have to believe the future is what we make of it!

906
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:00,824
Deunan!

907
01:32:01,248 --> 01:32:03,561
It's not good. They're covered on all sides.

908
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:07,137
<i>Gun platforms approaching Tartarus! Range: 2,000 meters!</i>

909
01:32:14,968 --> 01:32:17,655
<i>Our weapons are ineffective! We can't stop them!</i>

910
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:22,219
<i>Squad Leader, I'm heading for No.7. Cover me!</i>

911
01:32:30,789 --> 01:32:31,804
So, which one is it?

912
01:32:32,684 --> 01:32:33,667
There. In the middle.

913
01:32:37,373 --> 01:32:40,069
Fire all weapons at the legs of the platforms 6 and 8!

914
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:41,714
<i>What about No.5 in front?</i>

915
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:45,460
<i>Forget it. Concentrate your fire on the two platforms pointing No.7!</i>

916
01:33:31,057 --> 01:33:32,430
<i>No.6 is down!</i>

917
01:33:32,554 --> 01:33:33,387
Good.

918
01:33:33,613 --> 01:33:35,045
What's the progress on No.8?

919
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:03,642
There it is!

920
01:34:04,913 --> 01:34:06,324
I'll head up in the crossfire.

921
01:34:06,673 --> 01:34:08,430
You should have a clear approach from beneath.

922
01:34:08,612 --> 01:34:09,439
Got it!

923
01:34:27,383 --> 01:34:28,190
Briareos!

924
01:34:34,623 --> 01:34:35,469
Deunan!

925
01:35:29,414 --> 01:35:31,406
<i>The platforms have reached Tartarus!</i>

926
01:35:31,663 --> 01:35:32,991
<i>They're beginning their ascend!</i>

927
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,592
Deunan! Hurry!

928
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:21,749
<i>Three of the platforms are closing in on the D-Tank!</i>

929
01:36:21,784 --> 01:36:23,369
<i>We can't hold them up any longer!</i>

930
01:36:51,531 --> 01:36:52,429
What's wrong?

931
01:36:57,624 --> 01:36:58,771
It's not working!

932
01:37:12,406 --> 01:37:13,274
Briareos!

933
01:37:32,059 --> 01:37:34,030
Deunan, let me go!

934
01:37:34,427 --> 01:37:36,424
Forget it! I won't lose you again!

935
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:57,427
The password! Hurry!

936
01:38:14,497 --> 01:38:16,289
Mother... Help me!

937
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:41,449
They all stopped.

938
01:39:01,604 --> 01:39:03,359
<i>All platforms have shut down.</i>

939
01:39:03,592 --> 01:39:05,023
<i>D-Tank is secured!</i>

940
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:28,530
Briareos!

941
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:48,377
Deunan!

942
01:39:51,459 --> 01:39:52,448
Take it easy.

943
01:39:53,563 --> 01:39:54,367
Sorry.

944
01:39:54,402 --> 01:39:55,562
Are the Elders all right?

945
01:40:03,407 --> 01:40:04,367
I see...

946
01:40:05,149 --> 01:40:07,601
But the final letter of the password...

947
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:10,054
It's been left to us.

948
01:40:12,638 --> 01:40:14,480
It's all been left to us now.

949
01:40:50,929 --> 01:40:53,271
It's not as if anything has changed.

950
01:40:53,832 --> 01:40:55,485
And giving enough time...

951
01:40:55,859 --> 01:40:58,852
I suppose the sins of humanity will only get worse.

952
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:04,736
But there's always a chance that the next
generation might learn from our mistakes.

953
01:41:05,949 --> 01:41:07,245
So, I'll keep fighting...

954
01:41:08,246 --> 01:41:09,588
for our children's sake,

955
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,249
the true new race of Man.
