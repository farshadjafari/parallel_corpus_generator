1
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,773
<i>What happened to you?</i>

2
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,051
Fuck!

3
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,879
Fuck!

4
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,914
Fuck!

5
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,138
<i>We don't have much time...</i>

6
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,945
<i>Tick tock, this man got rocked...</i>

7
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,945
I have an appointment.

8
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,922
My assistant was supposed to reschedule.

9
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:03,988
She didn't.

10
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,223
Better call her then.

11
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,750
Mom said you're not allowed
to reschedule with me.

12
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,233
Please, just this once.

13
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:14,757
Don't be a putz.

14
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,825
Putz?

15
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,196
I worked 80 hours this week.
What did you do?

16
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,774
Come on Dad, we don't have much time!

17
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,689
We have to build a wall so the monster doesn't
break through!

18
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,197
What ever happened to tea parties?

19
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,501
Don't little girls have tea parties anymore?

20
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,492
You dig the moat.

21
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,408
Dig the moat before the monster comes.
It will slow him down.

22
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,861
Can't your mom dig the moat when she gets up?

23
00:02:57,896 --> 00:03:00,280
I'm not really prepared for any kind of...

24
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:01,112
...moat digging.

25
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,583
Hurry up, we don't have much time!

26
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,380
Emma.

27
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,885
I just don't do this... okay?

28
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,230
Your mom can play these games with you,
okay?

29
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,892
I've never been any good at this anyhow.

30
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,296
You can do this Dad.

31
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,161
Oh no!

32
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,044
What?

33
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,345
It's coming! It's too late for the moat!
Get down Dad!

34
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,421
Ah! It's got me!

35
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,653
Ah! Save me Dad! Save me!

36
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,930
He's pulling me into his cave!

37
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,921
He's really ugly Dad!

38
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,464
It's got me. Come on save me.

39
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,951
Get away from her you big asshole!

40
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,352
Get 'em Dad! Get the bastard!

41
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,787
You mess with my daughter, you mess with me!

42
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,230
Fort! Fort! Back to the fort!

43
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,231
Get down! Get down!

44
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,666
You did it Dad! You got 'em!

45
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,570
Hey...

46
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,699
When did you start saying... bastard?

47
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,206
<i>28, 37, and 53.</i>

48
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,699
<i>So good luck to everybody out there who played
last night's lotto...</i>

49
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,578
Dad?

50
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,270
<i>I thought you were gone.</i>

51
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,298
<i>I went to your funeral.</i>

52
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,256
<i>No, no, no. I'm here...</i>

53
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,851
<i>I'll always be here for you.</i>

54
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,943
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!

55
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,193
It's bedtime Princess Moomba.

56
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,462
It's time to get your beauty rest.

57
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,514
Your majesty has blessed the land with your
beauty today.

58
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,531
But it's quiet now and the journey will continue
tomorrow.

59
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,339
The rebels have infiltrated the base!

60
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,410
Bam! Boom!

61
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,830
Sir Lawrence, Sir Lawrence!

62
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,557
Send in the cavalry quick!

63
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,250
Sir Lawrence? Sir Lawrence?!

64
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,518
What happened to you?

65
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,484
No!

66
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,415
Why?!

67
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,450
Why?!

68
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,022
Whhyyy?!

69
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,388
He was so young!

70
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,731
Emma? You're not in there playing are you?

71
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,140
That's a very convincing snore, but you'll have to
turn your light off young lady.

72
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,810
Thank you.

73
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,041
<i>Good night Grandma.</i>

74
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,642
Good night sleep-talker.

75
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,322
Help!

76
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,648
She buys her friends.

77
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,132
She bought that body too.

78
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,365
Stop!

79
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,437
Stop talking about me!

80
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,837
Stop!

81
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,342
Stop it!

82
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,509
Stop it!

83
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,658
You idiot!

84
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,226
You idiot!

85
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,097
- How could you be so frivolous and stupid?
- Hello?

86
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:12,498
You're just like your father!

87
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,564
He was an idiot too.

88
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,900
You're disgusting! You're disgusting to look at!

89
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,571
Even your own children are embarrassed to be
with you!

90
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:20,538
I made a mistake the minute I met you!

91
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,842
I should have known what a loser you were
gonna be!

92
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,625
Unemployed and penniless!

93
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,374
Someday I'll find a real man.

94
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,053
<i>How many nights are you going to do this?</i>

95
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,491
<i>This has got to stop.</i>

96
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,294
<i>You can't be absent all the time.</i>

97
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,565
<i>You have a whole other life...</i>

98
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,332
<i>You can't change that now.</i>

99
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,131
<i>...that you are forgetting.</i>

100
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,581
No! No!

101
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,728
Grandpa!

102
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,504
Grandpa!

103
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,006
Grandpa!

104
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,333
No, the girl!

105
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,835
Go get the girl!

106
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,776
Help!

107
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,545
Well, it's one of the most anticipated IPO's of the
year.

108
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,380
<i>Apollo Systems, the market leader in the
emerging technology of mobile delivery systems</i>

109
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,951
<i>will be choosing a lead underwriter sometime
this week.</i>

110
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,656
<i>Word on the street is that Hannaway Capital,
VanBuskirk Black and Company...</i>

111
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:48,525
<i>and Hamilton Partners are all in the front-
running for the bid.</i>

112
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,198
<i>It's going to be quite a beauty contest and we imagine one of
these firms will emerge with a registration statement sometime soon.</i>

113
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,165
<i>David... do you...</i>

114
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,871
John!

115
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,074
No, not this morning.
Please Roger, I hate that look.

116
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,269
I hate that pants-shitting terror look.

117
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,244
What is it man? I'm not going to kill you.

118
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,414
- You know you are gonna survive the morning.
- We're in a serious crunch here John.

119
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:43,914
We're never in a crunch Roger, ever.

120
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,474
Word is that Apollo is leaning toward Hamilton.

121
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,586
Hamilton came in last night and they low-balled

122
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,452
the fee down to six and a half percent.
- Hey, hey, hey!

123
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,415
- What, what?
- Six and a half percent John.

124
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,877
They snaked us early.

125
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:56,960
Hamilton? On the Apollo-

126
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,495
- Are you talking about the Apollo account?
- Yes!

127
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,401
- Hamilton did six-and-a-half on Apollo?
- They came in and they low-balled us.

128
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,460
Where did you get this?

129
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,538
Carl's contact.

130
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,062
Yeah.

131
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,371
- Who the fuck let them do that?
- It's anyone's guess.

132
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,515
You know personally I thought it was a little bit
too far fetched, but then-

133
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,467
Fucking bucket shop!

134
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,350
Apollo wants Hamilton?

135
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,288
Hamilton couldn't find a fat man in a county fair.

136
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,955
Fuck Hamilton, fuck em.

137
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,523
They want to win the bid on a percentage play?

138
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,960
- They're gonna have to do better than that.
- John...

139
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,193
- Good luck!
- Sorry.

140
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,663
This is desperate, I know these guys all too well.

141
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:35,099
This is a desperate fucking move.

142
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,869
Listen Roger.

143
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,769
This deal falls through this morning...

144
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,865
and I will kill you with my own bare hands.

145
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,691
<i>One... two... three... four</i>

146
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,860

00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,638

162
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,265
Branch!

163
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,494
Son of a bitch!

164
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,359
One, two, three, branch...
One, two, three, branch!

165
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,233
Hello dirt. And how are we today?

166
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,528
Nope.

167
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,963
Don't have the face of a fighter do we?

168
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,599
You're Jacob?

169
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,939
My name's Allel.

170
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,339
I'm told I'm supposed to assist you. You're able to help
with the girl.

171
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,040
- Who was taken...
- Wait.

172
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,115
You're the one who got your ass kicked.

173
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,263
- What?
- Yeah I bet that doesn't sit too well with you.

174
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:23,944
'Course a good ass kicking doesn't sit well with
anyone.

175
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,755
Are you mocking me?

176
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,883
Real sharp too aren't ya.

177
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,347
I get it! I get it! I'll play along!

178
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:34,625
You don't want word to get out do ya?

179
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,833
- What word?
- About your ass kicking!

180
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,372
Yeah no one knows you're actually a priss.
They're all fooled, but...

181
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,706
you really are a priss.

182
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,577
Is it your policy to let adorable little girls
disappear into the night?

183
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:47,568
- That's enough!
- Ohhh!

184
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,237
Cord has been struck...

185
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,573
Do we have a guilty child neglector here?!

186
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,851
There it is!

187
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,279
The fighter!

188
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,790
Just had to be sure you know.

189
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,418
'Course she's roughing up the handicap, but
who's counting?

190
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:05,762
We meet again!

191
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,063
Look, is this a joke?

192
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,134
Do you actually have a purpose or do you just
talk trash?

193
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:10,333
You lost the girl right?

194
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,572
- No I didn't lose the girl!
- Sure, sure she was kidnapped.

195
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,341
There's still time...

196
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:17,040
before all is lost.

197
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,275
You have a way to track him?

198
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,011
Hell no and who wants to? Remember he
kicked your ass.

199
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,481
We'll go around the other side. We'll find the
physical girl.

200
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:27,110
- And do what?
- Shake the shit out of her!

201
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,782
Shake the shit out of her!

202
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,744
We'll wake her up.

203
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,328
That's just great!

204
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:42,231
Last time I checked there's no way to physically
affect them unless you're a...

205
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,637
you're a pathfinder.

206
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,034
Ow!

207
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,165
Help!

208
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,399
Help!

209
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,189
Help me!

210
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,203
Please!

211
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,706
I need help.

212
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,249
I have a delivery.

213
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,153
My key was broken.

214
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,748
Are you a failure Ink?

215
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,761
No.

216
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,332
Because failure is not an option with us Ink.

217
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,563
Only perfection.

218
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,003
You can help me?

219
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,574
Yes I can. Would you like help Ink?

220
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,118
You need it.

221
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,486
With that shame...

222
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,689
That stench!

223
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,748
The code isn't here.

224
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,117
It's broken into two.

225
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,254
The carriers are drifters.

226
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,790
But they are loyal.

227
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:06,064
Find each of them and you'll have access to the
assembly.

228
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,133
Best keep your pacing.

229
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:10,133
You only have a few hours.

230
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,728
Fail now and you need not go on.

231
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,175
You only have one opportunity...

232
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,076
...to become... numb.

233
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,278
No Phil. All things considered I think I'd rather
be rich, man.

234
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,039
Uh huh...

235
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,541
Uh huh...

236
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,388
Hey Phil... yeah... I gotta go.

237
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,018
Yeah, I gotta get to the pitch. Okay?

238
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,153
I'm sorry. He said it was an emergency.

239
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,732
What are you doing here?

240
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,428
I couldn't get you on the phone.

241
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,029
If I wanted to talk to you Ron,
I would have taken your call.

242
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,066
Emma's in the hospital.

243
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,173
They say that she's had some kind of seizure.

244
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,376
Is she okay?

245
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,549
She's alive...

246
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,810
but she's not been responsive.

247
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,446
She's in a coma now.

248
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,594
What are they doing for her?

249
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,893
Well they're trying to keep her stable but they...

250
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,823
They said it's possible that...

251
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,333
this has weakened her heart.

252
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,170
They say it's... it's possible...

253
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,333
that she could just cycle over into cardiac arrest.

254
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,671
Emma needs you.

255
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,047
Kathy and I are with her but...

256
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,617
but she does... she needs her father.

257
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,886
That's not my place anymore.

258
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,390
We have to let that go.

259
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,860
For your daughter.

260
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,566
What can I do now?

261
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,364
<i>He wanted to manipulate you.</i>

262
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,605
I'm asking you Ron, what can I do now?

263
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,074
I'm good enough to be her father now?

264
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,098
We have to let that go.

265
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,242
It's in the past now.

266
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,035
Is it?

267
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,778
Well it's very fucking present for me Ron.

268
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,010
You know, you convince the world I'm the anti-
Christ and you take her from me...

269
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,085
You can't throw that in the past Ron...

270
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,485
'cause that's where I live now!

271
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,987
-I know that you've suffered with this, we all have.
-Oh no... please.

272
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,719
-Look, I am pleading with you...
-I don't want to hear it... I don't want to hear it!

273
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,354
I don't even have a daughter... anymore...
remember?

274
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,495
Those words ring a bell?

275
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,405
John, I'm sorry - Mr. Hudson is asking for you.

276
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,999
I know Judith, I know.

277
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,383
You need to go.

278
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,621
This is not the time.

279
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,024
I didn't come here for that.

280
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,191
You want to talk about lives Ron?

281
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,994
Well I'm at the point of life and death...

282
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,998
on a multi-billion dollar deal.

283
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,167
And thousands of lives are at stake.

284
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,072
And that's important.

285
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,098
And that's my family now, that's all I have left.

286
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,511
We did what we thought was best for her but...

287
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,342
but she needs you now.

288
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,477
Consider your obligation as her father.

289
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,581
<i>This insignificant man.</i>

290
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,887
Obligation?

291
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,787
What's obligation to you?

292
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,390
You don't talk to Shelly for fifteen years...

293
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,088
and then you show up at her fucking funeral!

294
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,331
Is that the obligation you're talking about Ron,
huh?!

295
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,133
You know, taking care of Emma doesn't
somehow absolve you of all that shit!

296
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,068
<i>You could have killed him.</i>

297
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,401
You're still a fraud!

298
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,773
You live with that every day, don't ya?

299
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,332
-I'm trying to keep you from making the same
mistakes.

300
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,173
Oh fuck you Ron! I am not you!

301
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,109
Do you understand me?!

302
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,965
Don't play the old wise man with me.

303
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,716
This is not about me and you John!

304
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,319
This is about your daughter.

305
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,217
Get out.

306
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:00,255
-I'm asking you John.
-I will not wait for security to throw you out.

307
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,457
She's at Lutheran Hospital.

308
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,493
<i>They all grovel now.</i>

309
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,401
Thank you for your order sir, confirmation's in
the mail.

310
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,546
I just sold five million of our new Bowman
Pipeline junk bonds!

311
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,475
Hey, you work for me don't ya? John Sullivan?

312
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,687
Scott Hamilton.

313
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:30,346
Yeah.

314
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,558
Heard you moved some big money down in the
pin. Five million is a big ticket.

315
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:37,119
Oh yeah... yeah... got lucky I guess,
I don't know.

316
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,726
Hey Todd.

317
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,795
Do you remember the Sable high-yield account
you threw back into the pot?

318
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,467
I just sold them three million of Rumney Casino.

319
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,062
I hate you.

320
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,532
Johnny! Hey buddy... how are ya?

321
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,334
Word is that Scott Hamilton has his eye on you.

322
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,638
Huh... you might be moving into a corner office
soon, huh?!

323
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,873
Unbelievable... you're here two-and-a-half years,
and you get a view of downtown.

324
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,849
You know what I got? View of my own demise.

325
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,614
Hey! To the talk of the town... John Sullivan!

326
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,315
To John!

327
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,699
This is ridiculous.

328
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,836
How many nights are you going to do this?

329
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,372
Hey...

330
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,743
we had a great day today.

331
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:31,805
I mean... we... we just had to celebrate.

332
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,346
You know.

333
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,584
Look at me.

334
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,180
What?

335
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,491
This has got to stop.

336
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,159
You can't be absent all the time.

337
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,062
<i>She hated your success.</i>

338
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,132
You have a whole other life...

339
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,503
that you are forgetting.

340
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,506
<i>You can't change that now.</i>

341
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,010
<i>You were so ashamed.</i>

342
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:48,726
Mr. Sullivan, your family has already suffered an
immense amount of grief.

343
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,627
So it saddens me to have to create any more.

344
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:56,334
However I feel with your history of drug abuse and
your negligent behavior regarding your daughter...

345
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,638
it's important that you be given some time to
re-examine your life.

346
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:04,106
I see you are currently unfit to care for your
daughter.

347
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,744
<i>-Therefore it is the order of the court...
-They stole her.</i>

348
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,058
-The custody of Emma Sullivan...
-Please! Please Stop!

349
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:11,338
-Be awarded to Ronald and Katherine Evans.
-Stop!

350
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,382
Damn it!

351
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,975
Oh! Let me help you.

352
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,347
<i>No don't touch a..!</i>

353
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,786
Don't touch a thing... please.

354
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,721
Asshole.

355
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:28,125
Two... three... four... one... two... three... four...

356
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,723
step... two... three... four

357
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,204
So uh... I'm a little confused about the plan
here.

358
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,172
Yeah, you and me both.

359
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:41,177
As far as I know, we're supposed to try to recover from
the other side, physically wake her and pull her back.

360
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,812
And we do that how?

361
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,643
I don't know. Today we're just escorts for him.

362
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,549
He's a Pathfinder.

363
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,155
You're a Pathfinder?

364
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,286
Yeah, I wouldn't try to have a real rational
conversation with him Sara, or even a pleasant one.

365
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,725
Oh, and he has wandering hands.

366
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,194
Ouch... two... three... four.

367
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,233
Alright.

368
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,103
We do this carefully and quietly.

369
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,119
We pack light so... uh... don't fight. Mmmk?

370
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:13,101
Okay, he just needs to observe right now.

371
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,544
He studies the scene and we watch his back.

372
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:20,516
Now we have no idea if thisgirl is being guarded
so it's imperative that we keep quiet.

373
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,682
We get seen, we have more heat than we can
handle.

374
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,686
What do you see?

375
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,927
It's her... Emma... the girl's body, she's
unconscious on the bed.

376
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,332
What else?

377
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,739
Her Grandmother's in the room.

378
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:16,728
She's doing what?

379
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,008
Standing.

380
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,909
And she's looking at?

381
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,878
She's looking out the window.

382
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,542
Keep describing.

383
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:32,920
Her Grandmother's looking at Emma now.

384
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,821
She's touching her forehead.

385
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,369
Doesn't sound right.

386
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,180
Where are this girl's parents?

387
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,063
You'll wear her guts!

388
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,971
You'd murder her, rather than hand her over?

389
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:36,667
Is she that expendable to you Ink?

390
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,309
That's it!

391
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,572
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

392
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,804
Let's talk about this.

393
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,475
Leave her.

394
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,177
Take me.

395
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,654
She's done.

396
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,662
Okay, I yield.

397
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,135
Morning.

398
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,831
Someone want to fill me in?

399
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,775
Our inside man says Hamilton put in an after-
hours wine and dine.

400
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,709
Says they offered up six-and-a-half at
seventeen.

401
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,975
Our inside man, have mercy. We've turned into
the CIA.

402
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,014
Fuck! Fuck!

403
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,925
It's okay, okay.

404
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,293
Hamilton's a joke. They're on their last legs.

405
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:07,696
We can beat this.

406
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,131
John, how the hell are we going to beat this?

407
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:12,069
We all know they're going to bring the offer to
market using the usual syndicate...

408
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:14,972
-and now they're making sure Apollo knows it.
-That's been the problem all along...

409
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:17,072
we simply cannot compete with their trifecta.

410
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,477
For the love of fuck people! Why do we want to
forefit before the game?

411
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:23,446
Huh? Let's pick up the bat, and take a few
swings.

412
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,917
Look, letting this one slide is just not an option.
It's not on the table.

413
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:30,454
Okay? We are there, we will take it.

414
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,221
We can always work the numbers.

415
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,987
We could substantiate an offer at... eighteen?
Be a little creative.

416
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,761
I love this woman. I love this woman.

417
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,991
That's what I'm talking about. A little creativity.

418
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,760
It's bullshit.

419
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,570
<i>This was nothing to you.</i>

420
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,079
<i>This has got to stop.</i>

421
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,147
<i>You can't be absent all the time.</i>

422
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,013
It's about self-image guys.

423
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,857
It's just about how they perceive themselves.

424
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,289
Apollo is high as a kite right now.

425
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,485
So we indulge that.

426
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,190
They want numbers, we'll give them some
numbers.

427
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,162
How solid is this?

428
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,524
Solid.

429
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:19,763
Okay.

430
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,370
So we meet Hamilton's six-and-a-half.

431
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:28,011
We offer up a firm commitment. Eighteen
dollars, fifty cents.

432
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:29,613
No one's gonna fuck with that.

433
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,181
John that's a pretty big stretch.

434
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:32,011
Dan!

435
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,614
I will sell this. I will sell this.

436
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,821
I just affirm what they already believe.

437
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,417
These guys think they're God. Let's give them
some numbers that agree.

438
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,421
<i>They worship you.</i>

439
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:03,970
Hey John!

440
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,476
How many generations of trash do you come
from?

441
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,123
Don't listen to them John.

442
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,750
Don't listen to them John!

443
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,324
You are better than that!

444
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,125
You are better than that!

445
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:28,962
It'll be $10.80

446
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,100
I'm um... paying with food stamps today.

447
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,975
<i>Humiliation.</i>

448
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,647
<i>What are they're staring at?</i>

449
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,021
<i>They'll all burn John.</i>

450
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,133
In case we need the big guns.

451
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,807
If all goes peachy, we will.

452
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,483
Quiet. Get back.

453
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,025
Damn it!

454
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,893
Oh! Let me help you.

455
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,830
No don't touch! Don't touch a thing, please!

456
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:28,593
He's ahead of us.

457
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:36,537
He's walking to his car and there's an Incubus
shadowing him.

458
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,676
What does the Incubus look like?

459
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:42,167
Large. Collected.

460
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:49,785
One... two... three... four...

461
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,411
What is an Incubus doing with him during the
day?

462
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,885
What does it mean?

463
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,694
It means this guy is fucked.

464
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:07,804
Two... three... four... one... two... three... four...

465
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:13,765
One... two... three... four.

466
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,970
Are you good?

467
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,740
Yes.

468
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,437
And he's bad?

469
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,239
He's not good.

470
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:54,950
What do you think? Does he seem bad to you
Emma?

471
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,149
You know my name?

472
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,512
I know a lot about you.

473
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,281
How?

474
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,089
When you go to sleep at night, do you like
having dreams?

475
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,964
Well, when you sleep, people like me come.

476
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:13,629
And we give you, and your family, and everyone
you know good dreams.

477
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,070
Does he give nightmares?

478
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:20,844
Not yet he doesn't.

479
00:51:20,879 --> 00:51:22,209
Quiet!

480
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,450
Can you take me home?

481
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,956
No, I can't. Why do you want to go home?

482
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,451
I'm scared.

483
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,354
That's strange.

484
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,056
I didn't think a lioness could get scared.

485
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,194
-What?
-A lioness.

486
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,336
Don't tell me you don't know.

487
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:47,667
Know what?

488
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,298
Ink didn't tell you?

489
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,170
You know you're not a little girl anymore, right?

490
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,813
In this world, you become something else.

491
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:02,148
And as soon as you came here you started to
turn into a lion.

492
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,652
A lion?

493
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,854
Well you still look like a little girl but...

494
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,380
you started turning into a lion as soon as you
woke up here.

495
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,651
I did?

496
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,454
Yeah, see that's why I'm so surprised.

497
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,460
'Cause usually lionesses are big, brave suckers.

498
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,099
I'm sure you can tell.

499
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,231
You're full of it.

500
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:21,996
Am I?

501
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,907
Just what I thought.

502
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,424
You know you might start working on your roar
though.

503
00:52:28,459 --> 00:52:30,907
It's tough to be a noble lioness without a good
roar.

504
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,185
Storytellers! Liars!

505
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,915
I'll be rid of you soon.

506
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:41,012
Intruders!

507
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,850
Stay back... stay back!

508
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:50,658
This is mine! This is all mine!

509
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,290
Roar!

510
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,046
This... this is all mine! It's all mine!

511
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,014
-Th... th... that's mine!
-Aaagh!

512
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,219
I'm here for a code. I have a delivery for the
Assembly.

513
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:18,553
There are... there are... there are codes.

514
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:26,363
They are codes that belong to me and they will not be
taken unless they are replaced by somthing of greater value.

515
00:54:26,398 --> 00:54:27,921
You want payment?

516
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,166
Payment will be your life!

517
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:34,693
No my life... my life... no, no! No!

518
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:38,808
For my things to be taken, must replaced and
doubled.

519
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:39,741
My life?

520
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:44,679
Mmm... nah. No, that's... thats, that's not of
adequate value.

521
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,447
-Ooooh... those are mine.
-Two!

522
00:55:01,482 --> 00:55:04,232
Yeah... three of those are mine.

523
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:10,136
So. Assembly codes?

524
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,398
This way.

525
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:19,616
So... you've uh... come here for codes have
you? Well!

526
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,777
I have codes!

527
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,480
Some... some... uh... somewhere... um...

528
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,752
Assembly codes!

529
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,094
Umm... somewhere... uhhh...

530
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:41,097
Assembly codes.

531
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:05,116
How did you get the big prize?

532
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,061
<i>Oh, she... she... she's worth quite a lot I hear.</i>

533
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,033
I can take her off your hands for you.

534
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,574
Liev... the Storyteller.

535
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,211
Liev.

536
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,745
The Storyteller.

537
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,148
Get down now!

538
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:42,831
I have a $10,000 PowerPoint here. All the bells
and whistles.

539
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:47,667
Showing you why we are the greatest, the most
reliable. Yadaa Yadda Yadda.

540
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,531
But this meeting isn't about us.

541
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,173
This meeting is about you.

542
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:57,805
It's about how you guys are going to be the biggest
company in the world in mobile delivery systems.

543
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:09,159
I've given them an hour. They agreed to
eighteen fifty and everything we set forth.

544
00:57:09,194 --> 00:57:12,856
As long as I show up with the final paperwork
and a bottle of Champagne.

545
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,063
We're in business.

546
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,404
<i>One hour... you've got to be there.</i>

547
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,306
<i>Wake up!
Your whole life is gonna crumble.</i>

548
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,741
Wake up!

549
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,903
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

550
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:32,070
<i>Tick tock. This man got rocked.</i>

551
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,526
<i>Two... three.. four... one... two... three... four.</i>

552
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:56,462
One... two... three... four...

553
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,208
What exactly are you doing?

554
00:57:58,243 --> 00:57:59,573
I need links.

555
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:00,801
Links.

556
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,571
A chain needs links.

557
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,946
Chain... chain reaction?

558
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,415
You've got it, tell her what she's won Bob!

559
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,987
You know what, I don't get this! I don't get you!
I don't get this mission!

560
00:58:11,022 --> 00:58:14,013
What are we even doing here, we're wasing our
time!

561
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,588
A child is going to die and you're burning her
time!

562
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,293
Death is the least of her troubles.

563
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:23,322
That's right! You know what, you're right! So
let's help her.

564
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,802
You know the downward spiral is essentially a
chain reaction?

565
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,472
And nothing that comes out of your mouth
makes any sense!

566
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,633
They're all reactions!

567
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,547
One thing begets the next. A man has a
weakness, he's flawed.

568
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:41,384
That flaw leads him to guilt. The guilt leads him
to shame.

569
00:58:41,419 --> 00:58:44,886
The shame he compensates with pride and
vanity.

570
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,424
And when pride fails, despair takes over and
they all lead to his destruction.

571
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:51,018
What will become his fate.

572
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:55,661
Something's got to stop the flow.

573
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,039
He's on his way.

574
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:15,117
The girl needs her father...

575
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:18,153
and we're going to deliver him.

576
00:59:20,723 --> 01:00:48,444
One... two... three... four...

577
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,241
One...

578
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,698
Something's got to stop the flow.

579
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:36,009
One hour, you've got to be there.

580
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:42,223
Wake up! Your whole life is gonna crumble!

581
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,654
Wake up!

582
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,041
He's running for help!
We don't have much time.

583
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:02,374
Tick tock. This man got rocked.

584
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,095
<i>It's okay...</i>

585
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:33,274
<i>it's all going to be okay John.</i>

586
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,139
Doesn't sound too good.

587
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,534
Yeah, usually I can get it to start.

588
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,211
Unfortunately I'm not to good with cars, but...

589
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,040
this is the engine, right?

590
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,548
Okay, alright.

591
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,553
-Oh, look at this. Yeah, right here.
-What?

592
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:55,113
-This is your problem right here.
-Oh thank goodness.

593
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,158
Ah, check this out.

594
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,021
Yeah, try starting her up.

595
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,559
Sorry... that was bad. Sorry, that was bad.

596
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,562
-No... it was good.
-No, no. That was bad.

597
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,809
<i>You were so cute.</i>

598
01:05:17,844 --> 01:05:19,841
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

599
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,410
<i>Why?</i>

600
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:25,018
<i>I don't know... I guess I was humbled by you.</i>

601
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,657
-No! No!
-Shelly! Come back! Shelly!

602
01:05:27,692 --> 01:05:29,257
-No!
-I love you Shelly!

603
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,395
-Shelly! I love you I want the kisses!
-Get away from me you freak!

604
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,157
-Kisses!
-No!

605
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,190
-I love you Shelly!
-No! No!

606
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,698
-I want the kisses! I want the kisses!
-No! No! No!

607
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,064
Oh baby! Oh baby!

608
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:45,797
I know...

609
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:52,245
I know I don't... uhh... say...

610
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,574
I just want you to know...

611
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:56,886
I just... I want you... I want you...

612
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:58,751
-John.
-Yeah.

613
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,482
I love you too.

614
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,058
<i>This is who you were.</i>

615
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,431
Why are you here?!

616
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:13,334
What do you mean?

617
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,970
I know who you are Storyteller. This is a trap!

618
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,973
You set me up! I'll kill her! I'll kill us all right
here!

619
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:23,069
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I'm the one in chains here, remember Sparky, I'm the one who's un
- armed.

620
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,371
Liar!

621
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:31,151
-You're confused by your own paranoia.
-Who is this girl? Why do you care about this child?

622
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,615
You are in complete control.

623
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,419
What is it you're so afraid of?

624
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,836
Why the scars Ink?

625
01:06:56,445 --> 01:07:00,848
Do you even remember how you got them or did
you lose your memory when you came through?

626
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,885
It was suicide wasn't it?

627
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:10,124
I can tell from your scars your entry was painful.

628
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,361
Remember.

629
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,363
You can see nothing.

630
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,760
They'll be gone soon.

631
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,233
At the assembly...

632
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,798
When you become one of them?

633
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:31,712
You've been given promises of beauty and bliss
in exchange for your soul.

634
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,715
This girl...

635
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,090
she's your ticket?

636
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,729
They told you bring her to the table and you
become one of them?

637
01:07:46,764 --> 01:07:48,697
Numb to your pain.

638
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,064
They told you to take her as a sacrifice?

639
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,394
That's all she is.

640
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:59,471
There's nothing in you that sees something
else?

641
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,466
I have no sympathy for their kind.

642
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,712
Don't try to manipulate my emotions, I don't
have any.

643
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:11,454
I'm not interested in manipulation, just in
revealing the truth. But you can't accept it.

644
01:08:11,489 --> 01:08:12,787
I accept what's real!

645
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,813
You can't even accept yourself!

646
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,852
Why do you hide under that cloak?

647
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,651
You wreak of guilt.

648
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,761
Guilt comes from somene with a soul.

649
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:23,890
Words.

650
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,058
A Storyteller.

651
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,069
Where is your army?

652
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,997
I have no army Ink.

653
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,973
I'm alone.

654
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,340
No one is coming for me, there's no trap.

655
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,527
You are in control.

656
01:08:56,365 --> 01:09:00,802
Yours, hers, my fate, are in your hands.

657
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,801
You will not stop me.

658
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,077
This girl will go to the assembly.

659
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,296
Hello!

660
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,436
You've come to visit Sadie?

661
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,474
Sadie loves visitors.

662
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,306
And they love to visit me.

663
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,104
They love to take my picture.

664
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,648
Love to see me smile.

665
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,613
They ask about me all the time.

666
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:28,245
What is she doing? Who is she with?

667
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,524
Where have they all gone?

668
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:44,470
But here you are... my... audience.

669
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,915
My name is... Ink.

670
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,849
Who is this?!

671
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,155
Her ugliness disgusts me!

672
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,655
I am Ink.

673
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,490
These are my prisoners.

674
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,823
I have a delivery for the Assembly.

675
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,492
I need part of a code.

676
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,724
I will speak with you.

677
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,364
But not in her presence.

678
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,378
Ooohhh... a kiddie!

679
01:11:22,413 --> 01:11:23,902
Roar!

680
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,612
It's gettin' there.

681
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,761
Guess we're not well liked here.

682
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,290
Who's she?

683
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,859
She's a drifter.

684
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,001
She was once a person.

685
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,136
And when she died she came here.

686
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:52,672
But she wanders around not knowing her place.

687
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:56,173
She's not a Storyteller like me. Or an Incubus.

688
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,275
She refuses both sides. Like Ink.

689
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,685
How long have you been a Storyteller?

690
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,521
How long?

691
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,684
Well, that depends on how you measure time.

692
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,092
For us time doesn't work
the same as it does for you.

693
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,355
We live in two different timelines.

694
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,540
She's cutting your hair.

695
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,907
She wants your hair for part of the code.

696
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:35,641
You'll give it to her.

697
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,908
It's yours.

698
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,061
Filthy! Probably worthless!

699
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:50,623
Of course I won't tell anybody I took it from some
cheap bag!

700
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:54,130
Of course, in the right light...

701
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:59,265
in the right light, no one notices anything.

702
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:04,008
When they light me, it's as though I were silk.

703
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,213
Shimmering almost!

704
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:10,012
Reflecting every gaze.

705
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,654
That's enough.

706
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,345
There's a bigger picture.

707
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,441
What?

708
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,784
Liev says we can't see, but...

709
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,450
there's a bigger picture.

710
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,095
Should we send for help yet?

711
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,766
Not yet...

712
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,073
she needs more time.

713
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,718
How are you able to do what you do?

714
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,251
It's all about the beat.

715
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:30,293
God may have taken my sight.

716
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,130
But I can hear the beat.

717
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:34,868
The beat?

718
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:36,495
Beat of the world.

719
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:39,307
We're all part of a song, I just hear the music.

720
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:43,435
You can physically change the path of people's
lives?

721
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,903
That's what they say.

722
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,708
You think he'll be okay?

723
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,785
Sure. A little physical damage can be good.

724
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,987
Shake the shit out of ' em.

725
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,656
That's what I always say.

726
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,991
He's convinced himself he's God.

727
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,563
We're just reminding him he's not.

728
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,060
Takes humility to remember who we are.

729
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,230
If he embraces his shame...

730
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:18,877
she has a chance. If not, the girl will be lost.

731
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,148
That can't happen.

732
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,511
Better get movin' big boy...

733
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,880
she doesn't have much time.

734
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:38,365
Shelly... baby... baby... stay awake... baby...

735
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:43,237
Shelly... Shelly... Shelly...

736
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,836
Stay... stay with me... stay with me...
stay with me.

737
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:50,078
Stay awake... stay awake... just stay awake...

738
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:51,010
-Sir come with me.
-Wait!

739
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,081
-Sir we need to get your leg checked out.
-Wait! Wait! Wait!

740
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:54,615
-Come on sir.
-Wait!

741
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,884
Come on, she's going to be okay.

742
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:57,417
Sir come with me.

743
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:58,485
She's going to be okay.

744
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,088
-Let's get your leg checked out.
-She's going to be okay.

745
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:01,612
Let's go over here.

746
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,757
<i>That's when I lost you.</i>

747
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,098
<i>That's when I lost you.</i>

748
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,767
<i>But it wasn't your fault.</i>

749
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,927
I didn't know what to do.

750
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,830
I didn't know what to do.

751
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,168
I know.

752
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,803
I know.

753
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,010
I came home, and you were gone.

754
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,573
But your things were there like you... like you
were just coming back.

755
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,485
I didn't... I didn't know what to do.

756
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:09,880
'Cause I couldn't for the life of me wrap my mind
around the fact that...

757
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:19,027
you were never coming back.

758
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,433
It's okay.

759
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,464
This wasn't your fault.

760
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,033
I miss you so much.

761
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,209
I miss you so much.

762
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:35,706
I miss you too.

763
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,616
Why don't you fight?

764
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,919
You're letting this happen.

765
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,261
You're a warrior.

766
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,429
You should fight.

767
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,026
Fighting would only blind you further.

768
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:41,942
Do you like my hair?

769
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,115
It's all the rage right now.

770
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,735
Makes no sense.

771
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,300
What do you care about her?

772
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,505
There's billions of children out there.

773
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,470
Her life means nothing.

774
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,281
I believe it means something to her.

775
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,357
Yet you push forward.

776
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,317
I have nothing to lose.

777
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,233
I'm damned regardless.

778
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:35,334
You've convinced yourself of that.

779
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,299
You're desperate now.

780
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,304
I know my fate is determined.

781
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,146
I don't believe the rumors about you.

782
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:48,709
What are you doing with her?

783
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:55,972
She's an extra... gift... for the acceptance.

784
01:20:56,818 --> 01:21:01,983
Dangerous, but he will be happy.

785
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:37,889
<i>-Get her Dad!
-Feet! Feet! Feet!</i>

786
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,422
<i>Go! Go!</i>

787
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,511
<i>This is who you were.</i>

788
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,427
How do you feel?

789
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:17,730
Lost.

790
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,562
You were in a car accident. You have a nice
little concussion.

791
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:25,769
Just go ahead and relax and the Doctor will be
with you in a moment. Okay?

792
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,208
Where am I?

793
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,767
You're at Lutheran Hospital.

794
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,874
<i>Lutheran Hospital.</i>

795
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:48,719
There's not much time.

796
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:51,095
Come on John.

797
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,616
Come on John!

798
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,282
Shit! We need help I'm launching the pop!

799
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,483
Do it!

800
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:39,806
What's going on?

801
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,742
The remote... it's... it's not working.

802
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,270
Damn it!

803
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,643
It has to be launched from the base then.

804
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,927
Go Allel! We'll hold them off as long as we can.

805
01:24:58,962 --> 01:25:00,656
He won't make it without me!

806
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,355
I'll go.

807
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,667
Wow!

808
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,438
Crazy blind bastard on the loose!

809
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,441
One, two, three, four...

810
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:18,946
I'll stay with him.
Buy me as much time as you can.

811
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:20,578
It's not going to be much!

812
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,545
One, two, three, four...

813
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:27,944
One, two, three, four...

814
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:29,348
One, two, three, four...

815
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,089
Uh, hey, hey, excuse me...

816
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:05,193
If I wanted to find a patient...

817
01:26:05,228 --> 01:26:06,025
...a little girl?

818
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,697
Little girl? All children are in pediatrics which is
one floor up and to the left.

819
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:11,358
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

820
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,385
One, two, three, four...

821
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,180
One, two, three, four... one...

822
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,401
three, four, one, two, three, four...

823
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,603
Emma...

824
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:33,372
Emma, look at me.

825
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,001
Oh my...

826
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,037
What?

827
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,941
I think the change is complete.

828
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,352
I see a lioness.

829
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,551
At first I wasn't sure, but then suddenly...

830
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,983
I noticed something.

831
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,487
Look how brave you've become.

832
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:56,061
The little girl I met is no more.

833
01:28:56,631 --> 01:29:00,192
She's now the most ferocious creature on Earth.

834
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,329
I knew I was right.

835
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:08,498
When I die will I be a Storyteller like you?

836
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:15,507
No, you'll be far greater than that.

837
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,784
You'll be much more beautiful.

838
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,917
Will I get to see my Mom again?

839
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,656
Yes you will Sweetie.

840
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:43,402
The real prize today... is Ink.

841
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:47,606
You have proved your loyalty.

842
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:53,243
Those scars, they will be gone now.

843
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,717
No more shame.

844
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:59,352
Because pride...

845
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:02,481
is what we are made of.

846
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:08,451
You will be our greatest asset.

847
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,335
Roar!

848
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,727
Ink...

849
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:47,031
Incredible Ink.

850
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,936
You hide yourself ashamed...

851
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:57,376
but you can't see how beautiful you are.

852
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,880
I don't understand.

853
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:04,876
Why are you here?

854
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:08,880
What have you done?

855
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:12,354
I'm here for you Ink.

856
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,092
I'm here for you.

857
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,264
Why?

858
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,333
Why?

859
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:26,264
What do you want from me?

860
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,240
I am ruined.

861
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:35,240
Why can't you see that?

862
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:39,743
Because I choose to see you...

863
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,080
for what you were intended to be...

864
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:46,451
not for what you've become.

865
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:52,895
When will you recognize her?

866
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,669
Has your mind become so corrupted?

867
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:58,395
Who?

868
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,408
This is what you could become.

869
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:06,246
This is what you will choose to be.

870
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:09,610
You don't have to choose this.

871
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:32,903
I don't understand.

872
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:35,572
I don't understand.

873
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:37,608
You know my name...

874
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:39,970
but why?

875
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,278
Because you're a great warrior.

876
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,014
Because it's said...

877
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,225
you can undo what's already been done.

878
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:08,139
<i>When will you recognize her?</i>

879
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,502
<i>Has your mind become so corrupted?</i>

880
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,708
<i>This is what you could become.</i>

881
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,946
<i>This is what you will choose to be.</i>

882
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:57,651
<i>You don't have to choose this.</i>

883
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:19,239
<i>It was suicide wasn't it?</i>

884
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:28,314
<i>I can tell from your scars your entry was painful.</i>

885
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:38,733
<i>For us time doesn't work the same
as it does for you.</i>

886
01:35:38,768 --> 01:35:42,635
<i>For me, a day is like a thousand years...</i>

887
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:46,336
