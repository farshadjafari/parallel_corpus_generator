1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,894
Byousoku 5 Centimeters

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,863
Chapter 1

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,881
They say it's 5 centimeters per second.

4
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:15,973
Hmm... What's that?

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,585
The speed at which cherry blossom
petals fall, 5 centimeters per second.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,843
Hmmm...

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,881
You seem to know a lot, Akari.

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,388
Heh...

9
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,493
Hey... doesn't it somehow resemble snow?

10
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:32,793
I wonder...

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,096
Wait up!

12
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:45,936
Akari!

13
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,007
Takaki-kun!

14
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,512
Next year, wouldn't it be good to watch
the cherry blossoms together again?

15
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:07,232
Oukashou

16
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,828
Dear Tohno Takaki-sama, I'm really sorry
for not having contacted you in a while.

17
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,970
It's hot during summer over here... however,

18
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,107
it's much cooler compared to Tokyo.

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:27,045
But come to think of it, I still prefer
the sweltering summer in Tokyo.

20
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,284
The asphalt which looks
as though it might melt...

21
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,514
...the shimmering high-rise
buildings in the distance,

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,020
and the overly-cold air-conditioning
in the department stores and subway.

23
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:41,196
We last met at the primary
school graduation ceremony...

24
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,399
It has been half a year since

25
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,999
Hey... Takaki-kun,

26
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,568
do you still remember me?

27
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,881
Greetings to Takaki-kun!

28
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,981
Thanks for the reply. I
was really happy about it!

29
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,014
It'll soon be autumn, right? The
autumn leaves here are beautiful.

30
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,524
Yesterday, I dug out my
first sweater of the year.

31
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,821
Tohno-kun

32
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,027
Senpai

33
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,761
What's that? A love letter?

34
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,028
Ah, that's not it.

35
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,962
I'm sorry for leaving you to do all these.

36
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,436
It's OK. It'll be finished soon.

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,939
Thanks. Hey, is it true that
you're going to switch schools?

38
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,166
Ah. Yes. During the third semester.

39
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,104
Where to?

40
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,539
Over to Kagoshima. It's
due to my parents' jobs.

41
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,704
Is that so... It'll be lonely then.

42
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,347
Club activities have recently
started earlier in the morning.

43
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:33,947
That's why I'm currently
writing this letter on the train.

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,183
I just had a haircut recently.

45
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,984
It's become short enough
to just see my ears.

46
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,587
If we do meet up, you'll probably
won't be able to recognize me right?

47
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,228
I'm back.

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,853
Welcome back.

49
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,576
You are also changing bit by bit,
aren't you?

50
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,896
Salutations. The cold weather
continues. How are you doing?

51
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,533
It had been snowing here countless times.

52
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,037
I had to wear really thick clothes
to school because of that.

53
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,310
It hasn't started snowing in Tokyo right?

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,939
I haven't gotten used to the move,

55
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,083
so I've been watching Tokyo's
weather forecast too.

56
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,313
Looks like it's not gonna rain...

57
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,254
But it's pretty hard being
cooped indoors too.

58
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,786
Hey, have you guys ever been to Tochigi?

59
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,261
Huh? Where's that?

60
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,290
Nope.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,833
How would I get there...

62
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,529
Dunno... take the bullet train?

63
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,069
It's far, isn't it...

64
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:03,432
Freshmen!

65
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,134
Yes!

66
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,610
Three weeks to go!

67
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,271
Fight oh! Fight oh!

68
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:13,115
I was pretty shocked when I heard
that you were transferring this time.

69
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,721
Have we both become used to transferring
schools from having done so for so long?

70
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,188
Even still, to transfer to Kagoshima...

71
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,726
It's pretty far away this time, isn't it?

72
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,890
When the time comes,

73
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,396
it will no longer be a distance
which would allow us to just get on
a train and meet each other.

74
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,961
As I thought...

75
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,628
it's going to be a little lonely.

76
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,776
By all means, I wish you the best of health.

77
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,159
Good day to you, Takaki-kun!

78
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,960
I'm really happy about the promise
to meet up on the 4th of March.

79
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,528
A year has passed since we last met.

80
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,694
Somehow I'm feeling nervous about it.

81
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,938
There's a huge cherry
blossom tree near my house.

82
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,878
During spring, that's
probably the place where...

83
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,681
...the cherry petals fall at
5 centimeters per second.

84
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,587
"Wouldn't it be nice if I could... "

85
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,160
"... stay with Takaki-kun until
spring comes". That's what I think.

86
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,640
- Want to drop by my place on the way home?
- Yeah, since it's raining anyway.

87
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,798
The weather forecast says
that the snow will be coming.

88
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,614
Eh... I thought it was getting
cold. It's March already after all.

89
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,282
It looks like many people
are going to catch the cold.

90
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,617
- Hey, let's grab a bite to eat afterwards.
They say that it's gonna rain in Shimokita.

91
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,682
Ah, yes.

92
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,220
Tohno...

93
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,994
Let's go for our club activities.

94
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,528
Look here... I don't think
I can make it today.

95
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,566
Because of the moving preparations?

96
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,629
Something like that. Sorry.

97
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:18,004
It's a great help that you'll be
coming to my local station, but...

98
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,071
...since it's a long journey,
please be careful.

99
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:26,248
As promised, I will be waiting for you at
the waiting room of the station at 7 pm.

100
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:50,335
On that promised day with Akari,
it started snowing after midday.

101
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,211
Ah- Hey, Takaki-kun!

102
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,080
A cat... it's Chobi!

103
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,482
This one's always around here, isn't he?

104
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,581
But he looks like he's alone today.

105
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,420
What happened to Mimi? It's
lonely by yourself, right?

106
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,869
How was the book?

107
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,567
Very absorbing. I read through 4
billion years in one night yesterday!

108
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,299
Where did you read up to?

109
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,340
Until the part when the
Anomalocaris emerged.

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,542
The Cambrian period!

111
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,173
I like the Hallucigenia...
they look like this.

112
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,108
Well, it looks similar, I guess.

113
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,708
What are you a fan of, Takaki-kun?

114
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,913
The Opabinia I guess.

115
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,388
Aah. It's got 5 eyes doesn't it?

116
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,517
I think Akari and I were somewhat
similar in our thoughts and feelings.

117
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,853
One year after I transferred to Tokyo,

118
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,866
Akari transferred to the same class.

119
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,334
We, who were still small
and sickly at that time,

120
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,467
preferred the library over the playground.

121
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,840
That's why we came to
naturally become friends.

122
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,746
Because of that, we were
teased by our classmates.

123
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:03,538
But...

124
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:10,554
strangely, when we were together, we
weren't too perturbed by those things.

125
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,394
We eventually started commuting
to the same secondary school.

126
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,996
"We would be together from then onwards"

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,896
For some reason, that's what I thought.

128
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,942
Shinjuku, Shinjuku.
This is a terminal station.

129
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,409
Disembarking passengers,

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,711
please transfer to the subway
JR line and Keiou line.

131
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,345
It was my first time coming
to Shinjuku station by myself.

132
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,615
It would also be my first time taking
the railway lines from here onwards.

133
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,435
My heart was beating quickly.

134
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,233
I will be meeting Akari after this.

135
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,411
The guy from before, how was he?

136
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,313
Who?

137
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,812
You know, that guy from Nisshou!

138
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,220
Eehhh? Don't you think that's bad taste?

139
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,749
We will be arriving at Musashiurawa
shortly. Repeat: Musashiurawa.

140
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,957
At the next station Musashiurawa, we
will be waiting for the express train...

141
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,213
In order to await the
arrival of the express...

142
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,432
...this train will be stopping here
for four minutes.

143
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,264
Customers who are in a hurry to reach
Yonohonmachi and Oomiya are advised to...

144
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,256
Uhm... it's Shinohara here.

145
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,153
Uhm... is Takaki-kun there?

146
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,195
It's Akari-chan.

147
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,602
Huh? Transferring?

148
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,365
What about Nishi Secondary? We
worked so hard to get accepted.

149
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,367
They say I have to go to Tochigi Public...

150
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,241
I'm sorry...

151
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,242
No... it's not something you
need to apologize about...

152
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,813
I told them to let me commute from
Aunt Katsushika's place, but...

153
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,083
they told me I couldn't
do it until I was older...

154
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,185
I got it.

155
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,584
It's alright.

156
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,262
It's OK...

157
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,699
I'm sorry...

158
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,267
I was pushing so hard on the
telephone receiver that my ears hurt.

159
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:46,033
I understood perfectly that
Akari had been hurt, but...

160
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,105
I couldn't do anything about it.

161
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,990
At the transfer station's terminal,
it started to become crowded...

162
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,192
...with people
returning home from work.

163
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,628
Everyone's shoes were wet from
soaking in the water from the snow.

164
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,390
The air was...

165
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,595
infused with the unique smell of a
snowy day in a city, and was cold.

166
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,265
Attention please, all passengers.

167
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,800
The train on the Utsunomiya line, headed
towards Koyama and Utsunomiya,

168
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,169
...will be arriving around
8 minutes late due to the snow.

169
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,405
We offer our sincerest apologies
to passengers who are in a hurry.

170
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,645
Until that moment, the possibility
that the trains could be delayed

171
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,844
had not even crossed my mind.

172
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,418
My uneasiness suddenly increased.

173
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,959
Due to the snow, this train is
currently around 10 minutes late.

174
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,358
Our sincerest apologies to those who
were in a hurry to catch this train.

175
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,734
A little while after we
passed Oomiya station,

176
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,704
in the blink of an eye, the buildings
in the scenery became sparse.

177
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,992
The next stop is Kuki, Kuki.

178
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,322
Our sincerest apologies for
the late arrival to this station.

179
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,130
Passengers transferring to the Toubuisezaki
line, please approach the number 5 exit.

180
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,671
Due to the following train being delayed,

181
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,734
this train will be temporarily
stopping here for 10 minutes.

182
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,911
We offer our sincerest apologies
for the trouble we are causing...

183
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,613
... to passengers in a hurry,

184
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,246
but please wait here for a while.

185
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,319
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,151
Due to the following train being delayed,

187
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,290
this train will be temporarily
stopping here for 10 minutes.

188
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,372
We offer our sincerest apologies
for the trouble...

189
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:45,618
we are causing to passengers in a hurry...

190
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,251
Nogi, Nogi...

191
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,820
We offer our sincerest apologies
to our passengers,

192
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,319
Due to delays in the following train, this
train will be temporarily stopping here...

193
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,854
We appreciate the difficulty that this
is causing for passengers in a hurry...

194
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,730
The time it took to go from station
to station was unbelievably long.

195
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,566
And the train stopped at each
station for an unbelievably long time.

196
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,663
The invisible winter wasteland
outside the window,

197
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,432
the flowing away of time,
the painful hunger,

198
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,593
all these things gradually
wore down my heart.

199
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,701
The promised time came and went.

200
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,873
By this time, Akari must
have started worrying.

201
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,851
On that day... that day the phone call came,

202
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,519
The fact that I could not offer Akari
even a single word of kindness,

203
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,493
even though she was beset by a
far greater sadness than I was,

204
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,331
is something that I was very ashamed of.

205
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:34,932
So...

206
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,808
it's goodbye for us today.

207
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,075
Akari's first letter arrived
half a year after that.

208
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,045
During the summer of
my first secondary year.

209
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,647
I remember everything
she wrote in that letter.

210
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,625
2 weeks before today, the promised date,

211
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,058
I wrote the letter that I was
going to give her in person.

212
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,724
Things that I couldn't not tell Akari,
things that I wanted her to hear:

213
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,864
In truth, I had a lot of them.

214
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,353
We sincerely apologize for
the trouble.

215
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:09,737
In a moment, this train will start
moving towards Utsunomiya.

216
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,356
Koyama, Koyama...

217
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,291
Passengers using the Touho
bullet train, please transfer here.

218
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,826
Passengers getting on the
Touho bullet train outgoing from Morioka...

219
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:32,925
please go to the first platform...

220
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,998
Passengers boarding the train headed
towards Tokyo, please go to platform 5.

221
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,035
Attention please, passengers,

222
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,403
due to the snow, the Ryoumo line is

223
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:45,900
...currently suffering a
major operational delay.

224
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,604
We are terribly sorry for the trouble.

225
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,418
Until such time when the train arrives,
please wait.

226
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,449
In any case,

227
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,422
I have no choice but to forge forward
to the station where Akari is waiting.

228
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,031
<i>The train arriving on track number 8
heading towards Ashikaga-Maebashi...</i>

229
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,449
<i> ...will be going to Takasaki.</i>

230
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,453
Please stand behind the white line.

231
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,448
Attention please, passengers,

232
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:41,325
Due to the current snowstorm, this
train will be temporarily stopping.

233
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,759
We apologize for the inconvenience caused.

234
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,860
We are currently unable to provide
a time for the resumption of service.

235
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,463
Repeat:

236
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,993
Due to the current snowstorm, this
train will be temporarily stopping.

237
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,567
We apologize for the inconvenience caused.

238
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,635
We are currently unable to provide
a time for the resumption of service.

239
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,206
Takaki-kun, are you well?

240
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,331
Club activities have recently
started earlier in the morning.

241
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,077
That's why I'm currently
writing this letter on the train.

242
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:15,692
For some reason, the Akari I imagine
from the letters was always alone.

243
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,525
Just like that, the train ended up

244
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,598
stopping there without a
sound for nearly two hours.

245
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,466
Every minute felt like an eternity.

246
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,310
Time, clearly as if it had
a malicious intent,

247
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,575
slowly ebbed away above me.

248
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,980
I clenched my teeth,

249
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:44,084
and keeping myself from crying
was the only thing I could do.

250
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,850
Akari...

251
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,184
Please... just...

252
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,854
...return...

253
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,594
...return home already!

254
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,383
<i>The train arriving on track  number 3
heading towards Ashikaga-Maebashi...</i>

255
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,550
<i>...will be going to Takasaki.</i>

256
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,191
This train will be stopping here
momentarily due to the snow.

257
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,427
Akari...

258
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,458
Delicious...

259
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,996
Really? It's just normal Houji tea.

260
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,029
Houji tea? It's my first time drinking this.

261
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,397
No way, you must have drunk it before.

262
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,586
Really?

263
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,335
Yes.

264
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:47,410
And after that, we have this... I made
it, so I can't guarantee the taste, but...

265
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,210
if it's alright with you, please eat some.

266
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,245
Thank you!

267
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,852
I was really hungry.

268
00:20:58,857 --> 00:20:59,951
How was it?

269
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,554
It's the most delicious out of all
the things I have eaten up to now.

270
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,561
You exaggerate!

271
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,625
It's true!

272
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,464
It must be because you are hungry.

273
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,401
Really?

274
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,660
Yes.

275
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,067
I'm going to eat some too.

276
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,413
You're going to be moving soon, right?

277
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,079
Yes... next week.

278
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,580
Kagoshima, huh...

279
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,576
It's far away.

280
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,185
But Tochigi is pretty far away too.

281
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,621
Heh, so far away that you can't return home.

282
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,992
We'll be closing the station soon. There
are no more trains running anyway.

283
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:39,792
Ah. Yes.

284
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,490
Since it's snowing this much,
please take care of yourself.

285
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,067
Yes sir.

286
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,053
Can you see it? That tree.

287
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:10,695
The tree from the letter?

288
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,824
Yes. The cherry blossom tree.

289
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,928
Hey...

290
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,338
Doesn't it... somehow resemble snow?

291
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,443
Yes, it does.

292
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,161
In that moment,

293
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,190
the dwelling place of
eternity, hearts and souls...

294
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,636
became clear to me.

295
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,772
It was as if I understood
everything that...

296
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,706
...had happened in my life
these last thirteen years,

297
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,372
and... the time which was to come.

298
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,406
I became unbearably... sad.

299
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,019
Akari's warmth, her spirit,

300
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,779
how should I treat them,
where can I bring them?

301
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,658
That was something I did not know.

302
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,132
That we could not be
together forever after this

303
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,993
was a fact I clearly grasped.

304
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,265
The vast lives we had ahead of us,

305
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,873
the boundless amount of time which laid
unavoidably stretched out in front of us.

306
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,570
But...

307
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,718
the anxieties which I had caught
sight of soon melted away.

308
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:45,783
And after that, only Akari's
tender lips remained.

309
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:04,971
That night,

310
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,405
we stayed at a small barn beside a field.

311
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,942
Sharing an old blanket, we
talked long into the night.

312
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,718
And before we knew it, we had fallen asleep.

313
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,617
In the morning, I boarded the train
which had started running again.

314
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,157
Akari and I parted.

315
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,162
Takaki-kun...

316
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,428
Takaki-kun, you'll...

317
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,432
be alright from now on. I'm sure of it!

318
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,636
Thank you.

319
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,773
Akari, you too, be well!

320
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,174
We'll write letters... and telephone too!

321
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,197
I did not tell Akari

322
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,290
that I had lost the letter
which I had written to her.

323
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,634
From before to after that kiss...

324
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,700
it seemed as though everything
in the world had changed.

325
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,982
I strongly wished for the
strength to protect her.

326
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,958
Just thinking that, as always,

327
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,023
I continued watching the
scenery outside the window.

328
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:47,233
Chapter 1: Oukashou: End

329
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,287
Chapter 2

330
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,811
Kanae, are you going after school too?

331
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,650
Yeah. Are you alright with that?

332
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,384
Yep, but make sure you study properly too.

333
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,460
Yep!

334
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,680
Alright!

335
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,368
Good morning.

336
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,667
Good morning, Tohno-kun.
You're early today too.

337
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,108
You too, Sumida. You came
from the beach didn't you?

338
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:02,779
Yes.

339
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,377
You're hardworking.

340
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,682
Not really... heh.

341
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,454
See you, Tohno-kun.

342
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,015
Yeah.

343
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,789
Got it? It’ll soon be time
for you to decide.

344
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,954
You have until Monday to submit.

345
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,122
Discuss this with your family
when you're filling it in.

346
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,193
It seems like Sasaki-san will be
going to a university at Tokyo.

347
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,735
Wow. I might be going to a
junior college in Kumamoto...

348
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,140
What about you, Kanae?

349
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,570
Uhm... uh...

350
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,838
Getting a job?

351
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,436
Uh...

352
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,880
You really haven't thought
about anything, have you...

353
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,541
Only about Tohno-kun eh.

354
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,017
That guy must have a girlfriend in Tokyo.

355
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,986
That can't be!

356
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,143
You still can't do it properly?

357
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,913
Mmm... I wonder what's the problem...

358
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,450
Don't worry about it too much.
You can still get on the wave.

359
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,892
It's all very well for you to be so relaxed.

360
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,686
Why are you in such a hurry?

361
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,299
At this rate, I won't be able
to say it before graduation...

362
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:50,718
Thank you, sis.

363
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:51,921
I can come fetch you back.

364
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:53,784
No, I'll go back to Kabu's.

365
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,446
Ah. Sumida, are you going home now?

366
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:25,622
Yes. You too, Tohno-kun?

367
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,091
Wanna go together?

368
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,824
If I had a tail like a dog,

369
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:36,157
it'd probably be making a buzzing sound
from shaking so quickly with hidden joy.

370
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:41,667
"Aahh, I'm so lucky that I'm not a
dog", I thought to myself with relief.

371
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:45,931
Thinking that, I was amazed at
myself for being such an idiot.

372
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:47,071
Even so...

373
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:50,369
The road home with
Tohno-kun was a happy one.

374
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:59,245
From the very beginning, Tohno-kun was
somehow different from the rest of the boys.

375
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:01,524
I'm Tohno Takaki.

376
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,058
I am used to transferring schools
because of my parent's work...

377
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,157
...but I'm not
familiar with this island yet.

378
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,024
I look forward to working with you.

379
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:10,361
I started liking him from that day
in the second year of secondary school...

380
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:12,591
... and wanted to go to the
same high school as him.

381
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,100
After studying really hard, I
somehow managed to pass.

382
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:21,474
Even then, I fell even more in love
whenever I saw Tohno-kun's figure.

383
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:24,776
It was scary, and each day
was filled with anguish.

384
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:26,740
But feeling happy everytime I met him,

385
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:29,478
was something about myself that
I couldn't do anything about.

386
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:33,589
Tohno-kun, you're buying
the same thing again.

387
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:35,391
This is good.

388
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,390
Sumida, you're somehow
always so very earnest.

389
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:43,695
I'll go first then.

390
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:47,101
Can I have this please.

391
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:48,596
That's 90 yen.

392
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,068
As always, thank you.

393
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:03,985
Welcome back. What did you buy?

394
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,822
Yup, I couldn't decide though... Tohno-kun
would sometimes be typing mail to someone.

395
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,290
Tohno-kun would sometimes
be typing mail to someone.

396
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:13,753
During those times, I'd wish that I was the
one receiving the mail he was sending.

397
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,063
For some reason, I kept
thinking that every time.

398
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:29,206
Kabu! I'm back!

399
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:32,004
Kabu, Kabu, I've come back!

400
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:55,667
This is a notice from the
town hall:

401
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:58,466
The next duty stand will be Sakai's
Agricultural Cooperative Fuel...

402
00:32:58,508 --> 00:33:00,271
Sumida Kanae from third year first group,

403
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:03,112
Itou-sensei requests your presence
at the student guidance room.

404
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,548
Itou-sensei requests your presence
at the student guidance room.

405
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,142
- Isn't that your girlfriend?
- She isn't my girlfriend.

406
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,347
Sumida, you're the only one in your
year who hasn't submitted your form.

407
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:14,754
I'm sorry...

408
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:17,574
Look, despite what we've
been telling you...

409
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,924
...it's not something you should
be too worried about.

410
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:22,492
Did you talk to Sumida-sensei about this?

411
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,360
No...

412
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:30,000
If you really cannot decide, how
about going to a local junior college?

413
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,330
But...

414
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,440
It's got nothing to do with sis...

415
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,754
Because...

416
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:58,764
my elder sister who coaxed
me into starting surfing.

417
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:02,033
And the important person who
occupies most of my thoughts...

418
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:05,735
I have still yet to...

419
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:32,596
As always, thank you.

420
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,571
That's OK. See you.

421
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,829
When I came to the place
where Tohno-kun was,

422
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,972
the inside of my chest
started hurting somewhat.

423
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:12,133
Tohno-kun!

424
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,869
Sumida! What's up? How did you find me?

425
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:19,981
Heh... I found your bike, so
I came along. Is that OK?

426
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,151
Mmm, I see. I'm glad.

427
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:25,214
I didn't see you at the scooter
parking place today...

428
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:26,881
Me too!

429
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,150
He is kind.

430
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:32,059
At times, it seems like he's going to cry.

431
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:37,423
Hey... are you going to be taking the exams?

432
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,635
Yes, the acceptance exams
for a university in Tokyo.

433
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,629
Tokyo... I see. I thought
that would be the case.

434
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:46,932
Why?

435
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:49,511
I somehow always thought
you'd go somewhere far away.

436
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,508
What about you?

437
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:52,678
Uhmmm...

438
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,185
I'm not even sure about tomorrow.

439
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,278
I think... everyone is like that.

440
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,078
No way! Even you?

441
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,179
Of course.

442
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,452
You don't seem like you're
undecided about the future at all.

443
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,830
No... I am full of hesitation.

444
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:11,929
I only somehow manage to do what I can.

445
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:13,598
I see.

446
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:15,935
So that's how it is.

447
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,408
A paper plane?

448
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,163
...amazing.

449
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:20,358
They say it's 5 kilometers per hour.

450
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:24,134
It's going to the
Minamitane launch facility.

451
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:28,367
This year, we'll see a launch at long last.

452
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:32,376
Ah... they say it will continue travelling
through the solar system and beyond...

453
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:33,346
No matter how long it takes...

454
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:56,995
You should seriously discuss
Kanae's future with her.

455
00:37:57,407 --> 00:37:59,068
She's such an absent-minded girl.

456
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:02,305
It'll be alright. She's no longer a kid.

457
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,213
I was once like her too...

458
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,514
Hey... Kabu, Tohno-kun is unsure too.

459
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:17,252
He's the same as me... Tohno-kun.

460
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:20,228
That would really be...

461
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,924
...a journey so dark and lonely
as to be beyond all imagination.

462
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:28,299
To exist so earnestly in pure darkness...

463
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:31,835
...without meeting even a single
hydrogen atom by chance...

464
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:35,658
To absolutely and wholeheartedly
believe that somewhere in the abyss...

465
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:38,241
...you are getting closer
to the secrets of the universe.

466
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:47,682
In that manner, where
are we headed towards?

467
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,450
How far will we go?

468
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:14,276
When did I start typing
messages that are never sent?

469
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:54,153
Kanae, have you decided
on your future path?

470
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:59,455
No... I still don't know. But
it's OK. I've decided...

471
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:02,358
I'll do the best I can, bit
by bit. I'm going now!

472
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:23,944
From that day on, a few
typhoons happened to pass by,

473
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:27,351
and on those occasions, the
island became cooler bit by bit.

474
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,220
The wind which nudged the sugarcane
gradually became pregnant with chill.

475
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,622
The sky really became a little higher,

476
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:37,762
the contours of the clouds became gentler,

477
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:42,164
and the classmates whom Kabu jumped on ended
up looking like they'd put on thin jumpers.

478
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:01,285
When I managed to stand up on the
wave for the first time in half a year,

479
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:05,525
there was still a little bit of summer
left. It was the middle of October.

480
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:19,636
This evening's weather will be clear,

481
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:22,295
...with a reported maximum
windspeed of 8 meters.

482
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,876
It seems like Sasaki-san
has confessed to Yamada.

483
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:26,508
Wow, just as you would expect from her!

484
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,448
Huh? Kanae, you seem really happy today.

485
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:31,117
Did something happen with Tohno-kun?

486
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:33,920
No way!

487
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:37,755
Today, I too...

488
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,485
...will confess to Tohno-kun!

489
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,493
If I don't tell him on the day I
managed to get on the wave,

490
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:49,833
I will not be able to tell him
from here on in.

491
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:01,640
Sumida

492
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:03,045
Toh-

493
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:04,683
Tohno-kun...

494
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:06,482
Are you going home now?

495
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:07,488
Yes.

496
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:08,346
I see.

497
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,118
In that case, let's go together.

498
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:35,376
Hmmm? Sumida, you've decided already?

499
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:36,116
Yes...

500
00:42:43,993 --> 00:42:45,288
I...

501
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:48,455
What's wrong?

502
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,360
I...

503
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:57,197
...to me.

504
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,006
No...

505
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:04,046
Sorry... it's nothing.

506
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:12,417
It's not working?

507
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:14,913
Yes... it's strange...

508
00:43:16,392 --> 00:43:16,915
No good?

509
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,458
Yeah... it could be that the plug has given
up the ghost. Was this a hand-me-down?

510
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:22,957
Yeah. It was my sister's.

511
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:24,722
Did it have problems when
you were accelerating?

512
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,662
It might have.

513
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,538
Let's just leave this here today and have
someone from your family pick it up later.

514
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:33,435
We'll walk home today.

515
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:37,206
Eh... I'll walk home myself!
Tohno-kun, you can go first.

516
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:39,608
It's not that far from here,

517
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:42,143
and I kinda want to walk as well.

518
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,318
Tohno-kun...

519
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:21,213
Please...

520
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:32,992
What's wrong?

521
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:35,732
I'm sorry... it's nothing...

522
00:44:36,572 --> 00:44:38,163
I'm sorry...

523
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:41,536
Sumida...

524
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:45,073
I beg you... please...

525
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:47,307
...stop being...

526
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,847
...so kind to me!

527
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:27,449
To desperately and blindly stretch
out our hands towards the heavens,

528
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:30,312
to launch such a big mass into the sky,

529
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,012
and to fix our eyes on something in the
darkness of the far reaches of space.

530
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,492
Even if only a little, I've come to realize

531
00:46:43,366 --> 00:46:44,958
why Tohno-kun seemed so
different from the other boys.

532
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:47,094
And at the same time,

533
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,800
I also came to the full
understanding that Tohno-kun...

534
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,072
...would never look at me.

535
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:02,140
That's why, I did not say anything
to Tohno-kun on that day.

536
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,160
Although Tohno-kun is kind...

537
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:20,360
...he's very kind... but...

538
00:47:22,138 --> 00:47:23,061
but...

539
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:24,796
Tohno-kun has always

540
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:29,244
...been looking at something
far beyond, far higher than me.

541
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:44,118
I could never give Tohno-kun
that which he desires.

542
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:45,726
Even so...

543
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:51,956
Even so, I'm sure that even when tomorrow
comes, or the day after, or thereafter,

544
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:54,060
I will still be helplessly
in love with Tohno-kun.

545
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,570
Thinking only about Tohno-kun,

546
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:02,810
and crying, I slept.

547
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:23,096
Chapter 2: Cosmonaut: End

548
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:32,864
Chapter 3

549
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,259
Thinking back to that day,

550
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:35,362
surely, that person must also
strongly feel it when she thinks back.

551
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:53,615
The last train on the Chuou Soubu
line going to Tokyo has arrived.

552
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:11,623
If only you could go back
after the New Year...

553
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,461
Yes... but I've got various
things prepared, so...

554
00:51:14,937 --> 00:51:18,304
That's right. Make sure you cook
him some delicious food too.

555
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:19,005
Yes.

556
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:21,741
If anything happens, give us a call, Akari.

557
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:24,625
It'll be alright. There'll be a meeting
ceremony next month...

558
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:26,906
... so you don't have to worry.

559
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,315
It's cold, so please return home.

560
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:52,871
I saw a dream from long ago.

561
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,408
Both of us were still kids.

562
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:01,549
It must have been because of
the letter I found yesterday.

563
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:56,265
Mizuno-san.

564
00:52:56,405 --> 00:52:57,133
Ah... yes!

565
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,564
Shall we have the meeting now?

566
00:52:58,707 --> 00:53:00,036
Yes.

567
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:12,913
By just living one's life, sadness
accumulates here and there,

568
00:53:14,657 --> 00:53:17,922
be it in the sheets hung out in the sun to
dry, the toothbrushes in the bathroom,

569
00:53:18,294 --> 00:53:20,728
and the history logs of the mobile phone.

570
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:44,676
"I still like you, even now. "

571
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:49,456
So wrote the lady I had dated
three years ago in her email.

572
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:55,191
"But, even if we were to
exchange a thousand emails... "

573
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:59,292
"... our hearts would probably not move
even one centimeter closer together. "

574
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:11,907
In the last several years, I have
forged ahead without any regard,

575
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:16,684
just to touch what I cannot reach. That
email was a definite indicator of that fact.

576
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:19,881
Without understanding
the sources from which

577
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:23,758
this menacing thought surged
forth from, I continued working.

578
00:54:24,593 --> 00:54:26,675
When I at last noticed,
my heart had already become hard...

579
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:28,757
...from the gradual loss
of its youthful vitality.

580
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,125
And on a certain morning,

581
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:35,837
when I at last came to
an earnest realization...

582
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:38,338
that I had lost everything
that was beautiful,

583
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:40,900
I knew I was at my limits,

584
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,807
and quit the company.

585
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:11,397
Yesterday, I had a dream.

586
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:13,273
A dream I have had since long ago.

587
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,677
In that dream, we had yet to turn 13.

588
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,077
We were in a vast countryside
completely covered with snow,

589
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:26,414
the lights of the houses extended far
into the distance, a dazzling sight.

590
00:55:27,189 --> 00:55:31,751
We walked on the thick carpet of fresh
snow, but did not leave any footprints.

591
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:33,360
And like that,

592
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:37,359
"Someday, we will be able to watch
the cherry blossoms together again",

593
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:39,900
both of us, without any doubts at all,

594
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:42,371
that's what we thought.
