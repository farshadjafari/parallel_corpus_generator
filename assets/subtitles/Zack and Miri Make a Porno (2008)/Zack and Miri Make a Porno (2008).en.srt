1
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:36,446
You little motherfucker.

2
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,957
Get up, Zack.

3
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:15,952
Come on, I don't wanna be late
for work.

4
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,525
- Ahh. Get out.
- Jesus, fuck.

5
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,630
Close the door
if you're gonna take a shit.

6
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:28,559
- It was closed.

7
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:30,530
It was closed over,
it was not closed.

8
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,399
- Close the door, Zack.
- Okay, okay.

9
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,404
- God.
- Fine.

10
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,222
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.

11
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:07,036
We're going now.

12
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,550
- You smell that? Is
that the car? Fuck.

13
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:20,780
Oh, goddamn it.

14
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,935
- What? What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.

15
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:24,918
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.

16
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:27,721
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.

17
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,041
- It's between my
balls and my leg.

18
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:30,924
What's happening?

19
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,439
- Please, pull over.
Pull the fuck over.

20
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,428
Okay, all right. Jesus, okay.

21
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,218
- It's about to
move up to my ass.

22
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:37,497
What?

23
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,266
The movement makes it hotter.

24
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:42,206
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.

25
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:55,077
Oh, fuck.

26
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,632
I think I burned
my ball hair off.

27
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,572
It's not funny.

28
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:31,889
Can you help me pick
out an outfit...

29
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:32,619
for tonight?

30
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,717
I'm working till 6.

31
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:40,854
- Well, I can try
stuff on at the store.

32
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:42,028
The store?

33
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,661
No, how about instead,
you get a friend?

34
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:46,533
But you are my friend.

35
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:49,837
I mean a girl friend, jeez.

36
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:34,013
Mr. Delaney,
can you work for me tomorrow?

37
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:35,448
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

38
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:38,009
Then you must come
in the next day.

39
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:39,185
I tell you.

40
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,351
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?

41
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:43,490
It's the biggest
mall-shopping day...

42
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:44,658
of the year.

43
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,170
And since the mall is
just up the street.

44
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,498
I would like you to
come out and work.

45
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,068
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:54,787
All right, you want me to work
on Moolie Monday too?

47
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:57,070
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?

48
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,047
- Nigga Tuesday?
This a new holiday?

49
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:00,907
You come to a brother
and tell him...

50
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,904
he gotta work on
Black Friday. You...

51
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:04,909
got any idea how
racist that sounds?

52
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:07,316
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?

53
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,000
- I never said
this, I tell you.

54
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,617
But you thought
it, didn't you?

55
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:11,818
You thought,

56
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:13,034
'I'm gonna lay down the law...

57
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,654
for this nigga, I put
food on his table,

58
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,257
clothes on his
nigga baby backs,

59
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:17,724
and he ain't gonna say shit.'

60
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,526
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.

61
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:21,285
You goddamn right
this ain't Amistad.

62
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,996
I can't wait till
the post office...

63
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,949
settles my disability
suit because then

64
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:26,700
I'm gonna be out
this motherfucker.

65
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,005
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.

66
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,075
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.

67
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,479
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.

68
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,479
- Zachary will
work. Zack, my boy.

69
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:40,647
Yeah.

70
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:42,607
- The customer
with the harelip--

71
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:43,316
Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,904
- -speak me, say
you were playing...

73
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,122
baseball here the other night.

74
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:51,751
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.

75
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,218
Maybe the harelip...

76
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,928
makes it sound
like 'baseball.'

77
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:56,796
Yeah, maybe you
hear with an accent.

78
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,801
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.

79
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:00,555
One day, I'm gonna
put a camera...

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,435
over there, and
then I can tell--

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,490
I'll know everything you do
when I'm gone.

82
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:06,101
Everything.
Scratch your balls,

83
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:08,174
take a shit, everything,
I tell you, okay?

84
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,739
Okay. Fucker.

85
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,474
I hate both of you
ebony and ivory...

86
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,815
motherfuckers, I tell you.

87
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:20,476
- Why is he so
fucking high-strung?

88
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,254
'Fuck off, I tell
you. Very good.'

89
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:25,129
Can you believe that
Gandhi motherfucker,

90
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,793
telling me I gotta
work on Black Friday?

91
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:27,994
Ain't that some shit?

92
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:28,365
- Yeah.

93
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,029
Like I don't
wanna do shopping.

94
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,808
Biggest sales day
of the year. I'm...

95
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,800
getting a flat-screen
TV, believe that.

96
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:35,685
That's my fault, I
should tell you. I...

97
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,570
asked for Friday
morning off, I'm sorry.

98
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:38,575
- For what?

99
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
I actually need a
lot of recovery time.

100
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:43,343
Tonight is me and Miri's
ten-year high school reunion.

101
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:46,078
I'm just gonna
get fucking alcohol poisoning.

102
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,046
- Reunion? Tomorrow's
Thanksgiving.

103
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,051
Isn't that fucked up
that they do that?

104
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:52,754
They say it's the best chance
to get everyone together.

105
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,841
People come back in town
for the holidays.

106
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:57,290
But they could have it
in the middle of the summer...

107
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,336
at a blowjob contest
that I was judging,

108
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:01,341
and it would
still be retarded.

109
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,567
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.

110
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:05,535
Why you always...

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,366
bending over backwards
for that girl,

112
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:09,277
- knowing she ain't
giving up no ass?

113
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,636
We got a good thing going.

114
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,448
She pays half the
rent, does dishes,

115
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,173
she wakes me up
in the morning.

116
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:16,178
Why complicate that with sex?

117
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,746
Besides, man, I've known her
since the first grade.

118
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:21,180
You don't fuck someone
you met in the first grade.

119
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:23,185
Excuse me,
I met my wife in kindergarten.

120
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:24,850
We got married senior year,

121
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:27,380
and she has been the queen
of my world ever since.

122
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,614
- What if you could
do it all over again?

123
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:31,223
I'd jerk off and
live by myself.

124
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,158
That woman is the bane
of my existence.

125
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:34,163
- See?

126
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:37,122
Excuse me, can I
get a coffee, black?

127
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,826
Can't you see we
talking, white?

128
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,503
If you're gonna continue
to emasculate me...

129
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:46,908
with this Barbie
dress-up shit.

130
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:48,273
I'm using your laptop.

131
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:50,678
Don't forget to smack it
when you turn it on,

132
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:52,848
otherwise the screen
doesn't come on.

133
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,482
Why don't you spring
and get a new one?

134
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,405
Same reason I don't
spring for clothes...

135
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,485
for tonight, I'm broke.

136
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,822
There's a chick who works...

137
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:02,588
at Teen Juice at
the mall, you know.

138
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:04,256
I gave her a good
deal on yarn,

139
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:05,756
- so she's letting me
borrow this stuff.

140
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,761
Yo, bro.

141
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:09,732
- What?

142
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:12,668
You're buying a
vibrator online.

143
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,738
- What's wrong with
the one you have?

144
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:15,667
It died last week.

145
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:18,266
Look at the size
of those fucking panties.

146
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:20,272
Shoot that shit. Shoot it.

147
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,677
My God, who even knew
Amazon sold shit like this?

148
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,176
This is incredible.

149
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:26,236
- Those are fucking
granny panties.

150
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,412
Okay.

151
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,399
A, I don't appreciate
you violating the...

152
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:31,149
sanctity of my Amazon
Wish List page,

153
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:32,790
and B, I'm not
buying that thing...

154
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:33,385
from Amazon,

155
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,497
because it turns out

156
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,553
I don't have a credit
card they take.

157
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,533
- Oh, shit.

158
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:46,264
I'm sorry, guys.
Am I in the way?

159
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,418
You're a fucking
faggot, all right?

160
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:49,935
Let's go to Starbucks.

161
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,928
- He's a shitty
barista anyways.

162
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,933
Cock.

163
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,476
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?

164
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,550
My nut sack in your coffees,
so how did that taste, fucker?

165
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:05,488
We saw your girlfriend
in her underwear, cunt nugget.

166
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,440
Well, too bad she's
not my girlfriend,

167
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:09,087
you little fuck--
Oh, they're gone.

168
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,923
Are you still talking to me?

169
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:12,994
Uh, just said, I'm gonna...

170
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,524
look up more fuck
toys on Amazon.

171
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,166
Oh, holy shit.

172
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,390
- They sell the
Fleshlight here too.

173
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,567
What's that?

174
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:22,922
It's a fucking pocket pussy...

175
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,503
that is shaped like
a flashlight...

176
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:26,138
'for discretionary
jacking off.'

177
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:28,743
That way if you get caught,
no one thinks it's weird.

178
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,602
You're just a guy
who likes to fuck...

179
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:31,510
his flashlight.

180
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:33,278
I am totally buying this shit.

181
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,035
Whoa, if you've
got money to burn,

182
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,015
how about paying
the electric bill?

183
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,147
- That's due already?

184
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:39,985
November's is
probably due now,

185
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,214
but I was talking
about September's.

186
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:44,219
Tell me this doesn't rock.

187
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:47,929
You kind of look
like Ronald McDonald.

188
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,861
That makes me want
some McNuggets.

189
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,337
Why would you wanna buy a...

190
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,342
pocket pussy anyway?
That is so sad.

191
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:55,703
What? Excuse me,
I forgot about the nobility...

192
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:58,534
that accompanies coming
with a fucking vibrator.

193
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,683
Think a kid in Darfur
gets saved every...

194
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,541
time a vibrator
makes you come? No.

195
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,280
- 'Real feel
action'? Oh, my God.

196
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:04,610
Yeah.

197
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:06,865
If you start fucking machines,
I'm moving out.

198
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,548
What do you think
a vibrator is?

199
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:09,314
It's a machine.

200
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,209
How come you get...

201
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:11,950
to fuck something
with a motor in it?

202
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,414
I've never met a man who can...

203
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,020
make me come like
a vibrator does.

204
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:16,671
That's bullshit.
You get to be Buck

205
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,557
Rogers having sex in
the 25th century...

206
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:20,562
with fucking Twiki
and Dr. Theopolis.

207
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:22,276
I'm stuck to a
bottle of Jergens...

208
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:23,128
in the bathroom.

209
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,389
Holy bejesus. You do not use...

210
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:28,161
my Jergens to jack
it in our bathroom.

211
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,868
No, you know what
I do actually,

212
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:31,403
is I light a bunch
of candles...

213
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:34,866
and I sprawl out on my sheets
and I listen to Sting.

214
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,392
No, I'm a guy. Give me...

215
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:38,446
two Popsicle sticks
and a rubber band.

216
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:41,584
I'll find a way to fuck it,
like a filthy MacGyver.

217
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:44,808
Oh, my God, I'm so
glad I'm not a guy.

218
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,184
How about this?

219
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,759
I don't get why you're putting...

220
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,254
so much effort
into this thing.

221
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,640
I thought we were
just gonna go to...

222
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:54,026
sit around and make
fun of everybody.

223
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,479
I can't wear anything
that I already own...

224
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:58,484
and expect to bring
home Bobby Long.

225
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:00,757
Bobby fucking Long? No way.

226
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:04,006
Didn't that guy call
you 'Stinky Linky'?

227
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:05,537
Yeah, that was then, okay?

228
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,398
Maybe now he can
save me a fortune...

229
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,373
in Amazon bills.

230
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:11,245
Maybe you can fuck
our landlord...

231
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:13,679
so we can at least keep a roof
over our heads.

232
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:17,787
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.

233
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:20,616
Hey, I bought skates
with last week's paycheck...

234
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,277
- and I need those
to skate with.

235
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,455
Oh.

236
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,658
And this week's will
barely cover...

237
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:27,663
the past two
water bills, so...

238
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:29,494
Is this sexy?

239
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,372
Yeah, in like a To
Catch a Predator...

240
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,377
kind of way, it is
pretty fucking sexy.

241
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:36,438
Then we're done.

242
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:40,075
What the fuck? Zack.

243
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:43,377
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?

244
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:50,453
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit. Just, uh--

245
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,569
Help me get this
shit out of my hair.

246
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:54,574
Just use the water
out of the toilet.

247
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,127
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.

248
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:01,018
- The back part of
the toilet thing.

249
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:02,027
Oh, that makes sense.

250
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:03,228
Take the cup there...

251
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,233
and then scoop it
in, there you go.

252
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:07,300
Here, I'll lean back
and you can just,

253
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:09,305
you know, pour it down
like-- Like that.

254
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,203
You're harshing my buzz,
you know.

255
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,208
This is so lame.
Don't look. Don't look.

256
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,173
Don't look.

257
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:17,178
Whoa.

258
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,457
All right, one hour tops,
then we're gone.

259
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:31,823
Or I had an idea.

260
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:34,296
We could just not go at all,
which would rock.

261
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:36,434
Even though we're broke...

262
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,330
and we've never
amounted to anything,

263
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:40,183
we're still better
than these people,

264
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:40,499
right?

265
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,783
No. Not at all. We're probably...

266
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:45,066
not even as good
as most of them,

267
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,978
unless one of them
is a crackhead...

268
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:47,773
or something.

269
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:50,576
Just tell me I'm prettier
than when we graduated.

270
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,245
You look about the same.

271
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,378
Definitely not prettier,
but around the same.

272
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?

273
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:01,623
Not really.

274
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,518
Well, good pep talk. Fuck.

275
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,866
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

276
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,173
- You don't
recognize us, do you?

277
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,342
Um, no, sorry.

278
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,347
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.

279
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,633
Were you the one they called
Stinky Linky?

280
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:31,382
Oh, no, no one ever
called me that.

281
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:32,818
Oh.

282
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:35,523
- Great. What does yours say?
- What the fuck? Come on.

283
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,425
- I'm sure I had a
nickname. Nothing?

284
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,224
All right, you
have a great time,

285
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,442
and before you go,
don't forget...

286

your copy of The
Roving Roe-Ver.

287
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,397

288
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,114
That is not shit,
that would be...

our bi-monthly newsletter.

00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:50,168

00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:52,835
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.

292
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,941
I love your enthusiasm.
Here you go.

293
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:56,946
Write your e-mail
address on that...

294
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,721
and I'll be sure to add you...

295
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,847
to our 800-member-strong
mailing list.

296
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,067
We had 800 people
in our graduating class?

297
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:07,850
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?

298
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:10,358
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?

299
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,462
- I am. Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.

300
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,723
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?

301
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,070
- Uh, no, I'm married.

302
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:19,075
Okay, cool. If you
change your mind,

303
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,099
- I'll be in there
getting shitfaced.

304
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:21,533
He will.

305
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:23,417
- Just so you know,
I eat the pussy.

306
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:23,902
He does.

307
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,205
Ah, tempting. Again, no.

308
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:29,607
- Shall we?
- Sir. Bye, Bets.

309
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Think about it.

Enjoy.

312
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:24,095
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?

313
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:26,531
- Yeah.
- Three beers.

314
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,096
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

315
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:35,302
Is that Zack? Or am I Zack?
Whoa, ho, ho.

316
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,309
Oh, wow.

317
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:39,805
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.

318
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,132
Oh, in my world,

319
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,510
nobody calls me
'the other Zack,'

320
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:47,145
now that this guy's not around
anymore, huh?

321
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:52,318
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.

322
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:56,160
- What?
- Highlander, man? The Kurgan.

323
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,384
Remember? I'd yell it
at you whenever...

324
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,389
we passed each other
in the hallway?

325
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,997
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome. Awesome.

326
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:06,836
Awesome. God, you guys have
so much to catch up on. Whoo.

327
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,010
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.

Have you seen that
big blowup picture...

331
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:18,650
they have of me?

332
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:20,585
Yeah, it's--

333
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,388
My hair is terrible.
I can't believe

334
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,055
I even wore my hair like that.

335
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,249
That's before I knew...

336
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:27,125
about styling
products, you know.

337
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,266
It makes a big
difference in life.

338
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,658
But you live and
learn, though, right?

339
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:34,183
I mean, ten years
ago, Pittsburgh,

340
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:36,397
who knew anything
about fashion?

341
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,177
Back in the day,
our hairstyle, oh...

342
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:45,646
Hey, stranger.

343
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:48,213
- Whoa. Stinky Linky.

344
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:51,345
Yeah. Although it's
just Miri now.

345
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:53,716
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.

346
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,654
- Hi, heh, heh, heh.
- Hi.

347
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,826
Wow.

00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:00,962
- How have you been?
- Great, great.

349
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:02,761
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.

350
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,989
Wow, that is not
something that you...

351
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:07,100
would have said to
me ten years ago.

352
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,036
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes. Yes, you have.

353
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:13,835
You just look...

354
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:17,104
Ooh, heh, heh.

355
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,695
- Well, listen to
you. Thank you.

356
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,115
No, don't thank
me, just fuck me.

¶ 'STEAL MY SUNSHINE'
by LEN ¶

358
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:38,032
Roxanne. Hey.

359
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:40,223
Someone I like,
what are the odds,

360
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:42,228
huh?

361
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,071
Zack Brown, we had four years
of Spanish together.

362
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:47,572
Why does no one recognize me?

363
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:50,011
- Am I thinner? Is that it?
- Look at him.

364
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:53,614
- Who?
- My stupid husband.

365
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:55,887
No fucking shit.
John Butterfield?

366
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:58,243
You actually married
John Butterfield?

367
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,651
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.

368
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,699
It sucks. You stop
appreciating each...

369
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:04,722
other and run out of
shit to talk about...

370
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:06,359
after the first year.

371
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:09,164
But look at him now,
chatty as fuck.

372
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:12,665
Flirting up a storm with that
cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.

373
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:15,701
You want me to maybe
flirt with you...

374
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,706
so he can see it,
even it up a bit?

375
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:19,874
I don't wanna get even.

376
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:23,404
If I was gonna do anything,
I'd wanna one-up the asshole.

377
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,708
You can give me a handjob
in the girls' locker room.

378
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:34,822
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.

379
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:37,449
Are you staying in town
for a while or--?

380
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:40,323
Just tonight. I fly back
to L.A. tomorrow.

381
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:43,181
L.A., wow, Los Angeles. Gosh,

382
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:46,226
Bobby Long, coming
up in the world.

383
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:49,524
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?

384
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,642
No, no, no. No
Mrs. Long for me.

385
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:55,198
- Then can I be
honest with you?

386
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,374
Sure.

387
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,379
Um...

388
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,846
Whew. I think I need a drink.

389
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:02,849
Do you need a drink?

390
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,682
Because I need a
drink to say this.

391
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,692
- I've got a beer
already, so--

392
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,520
Oh, great, thank you.

393
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,823
I think there's a
cigarette butt in there.

394
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,994
Yup.

395
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:18,024
Sorry about the elbow.

by BRONSKI BEAT ¶

397
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:24,665
There can be only one.

398
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,836
Can I get a beer, please?

399
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,478
Thank you very much.

400
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:36,846
Oh, Jesus Christ.

401
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,857
My friend's making
an ass of herself...

402
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,417
hitting on her
high school crush.

403
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:42,422
Oh, God, that's so sad.

404
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:45,289
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.

405
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
Brandon.

406
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,428
Don't worry, we weren't
in the same class or anything.

407
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:55,699
- Okay. Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?

408
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:56,926
Well, I went here,

409
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:59,102
let's just leave it
at that, I guess.

410
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:00,663
Do you have one of the large...

411
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:02,506
blown-up pictures of
your younger self...

412
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:05,378
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of. Right there.

413
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,313
- Gorgeous.
- Good times.

414
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:12,817
What do you do?
What brings you here?

415
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:15,188
I came with somebody
who went to school here.

416
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:16,553
- Really?
- Bobby Long.

417
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,538
No shit. That's who my
friend's hitting...

418
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,957
on right now. See right there?

419
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:20,962
- Really.

420
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,967
One dressed like
Hannah Montana?

421
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:26,130
In L.A., we call that look
'Nickelodeon chic.'

422
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,667
- Wait, L.A.? Los Angeles?
- California.

423
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:31,087
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?

424
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:32,456
- I'm an actor.

425
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:35,098
Wow, that's really impressive.

426
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,643
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?

427
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:40,441
'Fucking movies.' Pretty much.

428
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,729
Look at you. What--?

429
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:43,680
Anything I've
seen? What movies?

430
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,835
Oh, all sorts of movies
with all-male casts.

431
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:46,854
All-male casts.

432
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,255
Like Glengarry Glen
Ross? Like that?

433
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:53,220
Like Glen and Gary
Suck Ross' Meaty Cock...

434
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:56,831
and Drop Their Hairy Nuts
in His Eager Mouth.

435
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:02,463
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.

436
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:06,199
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.

437
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:10,539
More erotic and
with less women.

438
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:13,203
No women, to be exact.

439
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,549
I apologize in advance
if I am out of line here,

440
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:21,685
but are you in gay porn?

441
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,215
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?

442
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:26,517
- I thought you
recognized me, that's--

443
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:27,724
Oh, okay, I get it.

444
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:30,179
You're not in my demographic,
so I'm not insulted.

445
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:32,449
- Not really. Who's
your demographic?

446
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:33,697
Do you love pussy?

447
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,632
- I do.
- Then not you.

448
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:36,967
Oh, okay.

449
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:39,167
I came here tonight...

450
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,498
hoping to seduce you...

451
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:42,503
and bring you back
to my apartment...

452
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:45,570
and sleep with you to, uh,
get back at you,

453
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:48,589
you know, for calling
me Stinky Linky...

454
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,180
all those years ago.

455
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,381
Wow.

456
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:53,513
That is a weird revenge plot.

457
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,628
- You must be a
terrible lay for that.

458
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:56,653
What? No, I'm great.

459
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:58,313
I mean, I've had
enough practice...

460
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,423
and everything. That--

461
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:02,920
Wow, that sounded not good.

462
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:05,755
I fuck a lot. That's
what I meant to say.

463
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,092
That doesn't sound
good either. Wow.

464
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,000
You're a lot funnier
than I remember.

465
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:13,161
Thank you. Gosh,

466
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,610
you turned out to
be such a nice guy.

467
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:20,699
It just-- You know,
it makes it even...

468
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:22,842
easier to just--
To just say this.

469
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:25,193
Would you like to
come back to my...

470
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:27,614
place and maybe open
a bottle of wine...

471
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:31,122
and have ourselves
a real high school reunion?

472
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:33,557
- I--
- Hello, Miriam.

473
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,825
Beat it, we're talking.

474
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,919
- I wanted to introduce
you to Brandon.

475
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:38,095
Salutations.

476
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,261
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?

477
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:43,233
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.

478
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:47,348
Brandon is the star
of such adult fare...

479
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:50,111
as-- What was that
one called again?

480
00:22:50,812 --> 00:22:53,162
You Better Shut Your Mouth
or I'm Gonna Fuck It.

481
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,274
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.

482
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,148
Are you fucking with me?

483
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:00,485
No, they're fucking
with each other.

484
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,889
Oh, my God.

485
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:05,658
- No.
- What?

486
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,492
Granny Panties?

487
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:10,497
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?

488
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:11,862
This is so crazy.

489
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:13,853
I was literally just
watching you, like,

490
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:15,098
right before we got here.

491
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,004
This is so crazy.
This is you, right?

492
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:19,669
My name's Granny Panties,

493
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:21,938
and nobody wants to fuck me.

494
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,635
Nothing's whiter
than my big gay ass--

495
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,009
Where'd you get that?

496
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:28,645
Oh, I entered 'gay' and 'ass,'
and it was the top hit.

497
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,731
It's had 200,000
views in three hours.

498
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,683
Honey, you are, like--

499
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:34,824
I'm jealous right now...

500
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:36,486
because you're,
like, super famous.

501
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,092
Baby, please take our picture.

502
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,097
I get a picture with
Granny Panties.

503
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:42,356
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.

504
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:44,382
- All right, smile.
Okay, got it.

505
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:45,395
Did you get it?

506
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,630
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.

507
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,353
Oh, because he's the worst
photographer. Okay, good.

508
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:52,700
- You're gay?
- Yeah.

509
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:56,807
And I'm on the Internet
wearing a diaper?

510
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,700
Who knew you'd come
to Pittsburgh...

511
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,677
and meet a celebrity?

512
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:02,782
I'm gonna binge-drink now
until I pass out.

513
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,103
Okay. She'll be
fine. So you guys...

514
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,108
suck each other's cocks, huh?

515
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:09,122
Oh, like crazy.

516
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:12,587
Okay, that's enough, I think.

517
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,925
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.

518
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,430
He's not living out loud,
so he gets all like, ooh.

519
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:19,621
- You are totally in
love, aren't you?

520
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,797
Zachary, we are.

521
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,132
Wow, I--

522
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:23,625
Oh, God, I just
wanna eat him up,

523
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,034
yum, yum.

524
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,969
Save some for me,
yum, yum, yum.

525
00:24:25,974 --> 00:24:27,609
- I can't keep my
hands off him.

526
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:28,839
You've had one too many.

527
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,814
Although he does most
of the eating in...

528
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,819
the sack. In the sack
and of the sack.

529
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:35,598
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.

530
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:37,395
You do this every
time. You get too

531
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,982
Mary for everybody
in the room...

532
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:40,782
- and you can't
contain yourself.

533
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:41,718
Oh, I'm sorry.

534
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:43,803
And by containing
myself, do you...

535
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:45,887
mean containing
myself in a closet?

536
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,752
In a closet of
denial? Is that--?

537
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:48,925
No, no, no.

538
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,827
Holy shit, this just got real.

539
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:53,082
This is exactly why
you haven't met my mother.

540
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:54,790
You don't know how
to ease people...

541
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:55,732
into this situation.

542
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:57,875
- You just force your
way in every time.

543
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,870
I thought, maybe
for one second...

544
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,305
in this godforsaken town,

545
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,310
I could be myself.
I'm so sorry.

546
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:05,461
No, you're right, I
should just butch up...

547
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,504
and pretend that I
don't love it when...

548
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,847
you shove your
dick in my mouth.

549
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,877
- This is the best
night of my life.

550
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,284
Am I making a spectacle?

551
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,107
- I could make a
much bigger scene.

552
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:16,887
You really are.

553
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:20,225
I'm sorry. Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.

554
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:24,855
My name is Brandon St. Randy,
and I love Bobby Long.

555
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:26,730
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?

556
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,017
Is that enough of a scene?

557
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:29,799
I could start doing
worse than that.

558
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:31,403
The reason you
haven't taken me...

559
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:32,369
to your mother's--

560
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:34,197
Your mother with her
makeup and all...

561
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:36,106
her drinking, she's
in the closet too.

562
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:37,908
- They fight just
like real people.

563
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,876
I thought I'd be a
conduit for you--

564
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:41,144
Thank you.

565
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,947
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.

566
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:47,247
- Thank you.
- I love you.

567
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:49,049
- I'll e-mail you.

568
00:25:49,054 --> 00:25:50,754
Zack, it was so
nice to meet you.

569
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,363
And I will be
patient with you.

570
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:54,190
I will be there
on your journey.

571
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:57,926
I will be your Sherpa
up the mountain of gayness.

572
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,725
Well, might as well
see how many hits

573
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,897
Granny Panties is up to, huh?

574
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:35,735
Did I do that?

575
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:45,111
Thanks, George.

576
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:49,915
What kind of evil fucks
turn off your power the day--?

577
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:53,669
No, the night before
Thanksgiving?

578
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:55,318
Who does that?

579
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,153
Can you get an
advance on your card?

580
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,428
Fleshlight maxed-out
my $200 limit.

581
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:02,027
Not a wise purchase,
I'll give you that.

582
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:04,109
This is bad. If we
don't come up...

583
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:06,190
with rent, we're
gonna get locked out.

584
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,005
Who the fuck wants
to live there?

585
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,299
There's no water or power.

586
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:10,742
Which means by the time...

587
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:12,747
we get home, there's
no heat either.

588
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:15,682
Well, I think it's
time we put what...

589
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,687
we always talked
about into effect.

590
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:20,036
- You're gonna have
to start hooking.

591
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,011
You know, you jest,

592
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:22,816
but these are the
exact circumstances...

593
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:24,080
people find themselves in...

594
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:24,848
right before...

595
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,650
they start having
sex for money.

596
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:29,351
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.

597
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:46,171
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- What? You got an idea?

598
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:48,171
We could make a porno.

599
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:49,910
- Not the idea I
was looking for.

600
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:50,273
What?

601
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:52,026
No, that is a
fucking awesome idea.

602
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:54,031
Are you shitting me?
That's a rad idea.

603
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,958
That guy, Brandon
St. Randy, who's

604
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,985
Bobby Long's awesome
nice boyfriend,

605
00:27:58,153 --> 00:28:00,083
he said he makes
a hundred grand a year...

606
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:02,378
because he shoots
and distributes...

607
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,887
his own porno flicks.

608
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:04,690
If it's so easy,

609
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:06,356
how come everybody
doesn't do it?

610
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,081
Because other people
have options...

611
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,826
and dignity, which
we do not have,

612
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:12,891
which puts us in an amazingly
advantageous position.

613
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,731
Fuck you, I have dignity.

614
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,100
Where? Is it hidden
in your gigantic underpants...

615
00:28:17,105 --> 00:28:19,107
that are plastered
all over the Internet?

616
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:20,870
Is that where you
hide your dignity?

617
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,741
Every woman has a
pair of those...

618
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,777
period panties.
That's, like, a fact.

619
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:26,142
Okay. Families.

620
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:28,997
I bet people don't make porno,
because they have families.

621
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:31,643
But luckily, your
parents are dead.

622
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:33,987
Sorry. My grandparents
are dead.

623
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:36,019
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

624
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:37,761
So who are we
gonna disappoint?

625
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,556
Porn has gone mainstream now.

626
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:42,275
It's like Coca-Cola or
Pepsi with dicks...

627
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,260
in it. Look at Paris Hilton.

628
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,460
She throat-fucks a
guy in night vision,

629
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:48,898
now she's selling fragrances
to tweens.

630
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,265
And I'm pretty sure
she's legally retarded.

631
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,635
That's for tweens?

632
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,387
Have you seen that
Joe Francis guy...

633
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:55,572
who made Girls Gone Wild?

634
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:57,370
That guy is the biggest
fucking idiot...

635
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,675
piece of shit in the world...

636
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,841
and he has a jet and
a fucking island.

637
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:03,623
Look, there's got to
be a less extreme...

638
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:05,918
solution to our
financial woes here.

639
00:29:06,087 --> 00:29:08,647
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.

640
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,787
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.

641
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,594
No one wants me
around their food.

642
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,599
Would you eat food
that I gave you?

643
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:16,527
I would not eat food
that you gave me,

644
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:17,193
that's true.

645
00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:19,496
I mean, nobody
wants to see us fuck, Zack.

646
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,879
Everybody wants to
see anybody fuck.

647
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:23,466
I hate Rosie O'Donnell,

648
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,285
but if someone said,
'I got a tape of

649
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,203
Rosie O'Donnell
getting fucked stupid,'

650
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,836
I'd be like, 'Why aren't we
watching that right now?'

651
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:31,474
Because she's famous. Hello.

652
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,572
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.

653
00:29:33,748 --> 00:29:37,184
My underwear and your ass
are famous, we're not.

654
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:39,877
So who the F
would wanna watch us fuck?

655
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:41,192
- At least 800 people.

656
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,952
The jerks we went
to school with?

657
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:44,821
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

658
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:45,489
If you heard...

659
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:46,956
that someone we
graduated with...

660
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,511
was in a fucking porno movie,
you'd watch it, right?

661
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:52,231
I'd watch that guy Brandon
suck a cock, I just met him.

662
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,313
With this mailing list,

663
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:54,964
we have almost a
thousand people...

664
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:56,661
that would definitely
buy a porno...

665
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,934
we were in just to be like,

666
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,896
'Hey, I sat next to
that guy in Civics.

667
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,371
Look at his fucking dick.'

668
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,666
We sell a thousand
copies at 20 bucks...

669
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,904
a pop, bam, we have
paid off our bills.

670
00:30:06,948 --> 00:30:08,478
- So, what do you think?

671
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:10,907
I don't think I wanna
fuck a stranger.

672
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:12,085
Oh, wow,

673
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,750
like you've never
done that before.

674
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:16,186
How many guys have
you met in a bar,

675
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,353
taken home,

676
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,991
banged with your mouth...

677
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:21,021
and then never
talked to again?

678
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,859
That's what we
call a stranger.

679
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:25,071
Dude, I don't
one-night mouth-fuck...

680
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,076
anybody that I
pick up in bars.

681
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,487
You don't wanna fuck
a stranger in the...

682
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:31,492
porno movie for
some weird reason.

683
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:34,507
I guess...

684
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,711
We could fuck.

685
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:40,813
- Ew.
- Fuck you.

686
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:43,037
I mean, you're a ni
ce-enough-looking...

687
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,280
guy and everything--

688
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:45,326
Holy fuck, thank you.

689
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:47,317
You're an
all-right-enough-looking girl.

690
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:49,619
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying...

691
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:51,300
it'd be weird and
wrong, you know,

692
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:52,488
like fucking my brother.

693
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:53,347
Okay, seriously,

694
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,352
we're just talking
about sex, okay?

695
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,942
It's for a purpose.
It's for getting rich.

696
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,929
Only my dick and your pussy...

697
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,669
would be doing
something weird.

698
00:31:01,674 --> 00:31:03,802
Our bodies and brains
would be acting.

699
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:05,339
- Wow.

700
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:07,344
Just explain to your
private beforehand,

701
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:09,140
'Look, this doesn't
mean anything.

702
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:11,145
We're just doing
this for cash.'

703
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,645
- Oh, my God.
- What?

704
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,769
You're just doing this
because you've...

705
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,774
always wanted to
fuck me, aren't you?

706
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:21,131
Yes. I've gone my whole
life pretending...

707
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:23,450
that I want nothing
to do with you,

708
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,775
just hoping one day...

709
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,924
we'd be in such dire
financial straits...

710
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,571
that I could use it...

711
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:30,656
to finally make
my move on you.

712
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:36,465
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.

713
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:39,334
See, I was pretending to cry
right there.

714
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:43,300
I guess it's not
like it'd be creepy,

715
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:45,627
like if we got way
too drunk one night...

716
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,577
and accidentally
fucked, you know?

717
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,434
No. We'd be going in...

718
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:52,178
with the understanding
that it's--

719
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:53,850
A business decision.

720
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:56,455
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.

721
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,187
- Right.
- And by end.

722
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:00,353
I mean, I'll be
waxing your ass.

723
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:01,528
Fuck you.

724
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,533
I'm not even letting
you see my ass.

725
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,696
I've seen your ass
and the rest of you...

726
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:07,701
naked around a
billion times already.

727
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:10,533
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.

728
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:12,938
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.

729
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:14,995
Are you kidding? That
party we went to...

730
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,238
where you got blasted,

731
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:18,336
and Houls dared you
to give yourself head,

732
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:20,093
and we all watched
you try for,

733
00:32:20,098 --> 00:32:20,976
like, an hour.

734
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,280
Oh, yeah. Thanks
by the way, for...

735
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:25,782
fucking letting me
do that. Thank you.

736
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:27,747
Oh, God. We really
do know too much...

737
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:28,550
about each other.

738
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:32,150
See, and this would really
just be one more thing.

739
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,315
I mean, look at us.
It's Thanksgiving...

740
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
and we're huddled
around a flaming...

741
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,730
fucking garbage can
like a couple of steno bums.

742
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,957
I mean, this could
give us a chance...

743
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:42,962
to pay off our
debt, pay our bills,

744
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:46,972
get a fucking nicer apartment
with heat in it maybe.

745
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,810
What are you doing?

746
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:55,839
Miriam Linky, will
you have sex...

747
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:58,143
with me on camera for money?

748
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,359
I will.

749
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:09,591
- A producer?
- Yeah.

750
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:11,589
- Guy who gets to
finance the movie.

751
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:13,594
You think I got
that kind of money?

752
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,540
We just need that.
What you're about...

753
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:16,865
to spend on the flat screen.

754
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,418
Now I can't get
my flat screen?

755
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:19,067
Fuck that.

756
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:21,221
No, no, no. With your
cut of the profits,

757
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:23,171
you're gonna get
two flat screens.

758
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:25,440
One in your living room,
one in your bathroom.

759
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:27,612
One in the bathroom?

760
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:29,770
You know, it's always
been my dream...

761
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,046
to watch shit while I shit.

762
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,140
Everyone with an ass...

763
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,849
loves to watch shit
while they shit.

764
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:35,910
- I'm gonna make
that happen for you.

765
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:37,085
I don't know, man.

766
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,820
What else the producer do?

767
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,412
- Um, they help
with the casting.

768
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,758
What's casting?

769
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:44,763
Finding the people
to be in the movie.

770
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:46,457
- I get to help
pick the women?

771
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:46,728
Yeah.

772
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,694
Like, I can look at
a titty, make sure...

773
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:50,265
there ain't no moles on there?

774
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,063
- You can look at
both titties, man.

775
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,235
Man.

776
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,205
I've been looking at
the same busted...

777
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,210
titties for the past
almost 20 years.

778
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,896
- I'm due for
another new titty.

779
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,901
Please help us. Please.

780
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,982
Please.

781
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,787
Yes. Yes. I love you.

782
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,555
Well, don't mind that smell.

783
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,393
We had some homeless people
squatting in here.

784
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:18,419
You know, they'd
void their bowels...

785
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:19,995
everywhere but the bathroom.

786
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,048
Anyway, you pick up the poop...

787
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,630
and you've got yourself
a movie studio.

788
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:26,701
Why don't we shoot
in your apartment?

789
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:27,178
No power.

790
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:29,037
You wanna pay our
electric bill?

791
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:31,943
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.

792
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:37,112
- Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

793
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:41,511
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

794
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:44,748
Oh, God. Come on.

795
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:49,586
Why the fuck do I have to
do everything? Fuckers.

796
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,464
Hey, what is that?

797
00:34:55,202 --> 00:34:59,832
Fucking guys. This fucking
team, man. They fucking suck.

798
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:04,175
I'm gonna hatefuck
the shit out of you, ref.

799
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:06,676
- Dude.
- It's cool.

800
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:08,847
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.

801
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:11,678
Didn't you used to
videotape the varsity...

802
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:13,582
basketball games
in high school?

803
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:15,520
Just the away games.
I did it because

804
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:17,519
I was trying to
fuck a cheerleader.

805
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:18,720
Which one?

806
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,974
Whichever one wanted
to fuck the guy...

807
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:22,858
who taped the varsity games.

808
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:23,863
- Aw.

809
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:25,694
Still know how to
work a camera?

810
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,227
- Who cares what the title is?

811
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:28,964
The porn I liked
when I was a kid,

812
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:29,960
it was always, like,

813
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,800
a spoof of a popular
movie, you know?

814
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:34,330
Like, um, Edward Penishands.

815
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,914
Okay, so we need
a mildly clever,

816
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,540
vaguely dirty title,

817
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:40,308
that sounds like
a real movie...

818
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:41,868
- and sums up what
you're gonna see.

819
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,044
Correct.

820
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:45,176
An American
Werewolf in Brenda?

821
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,352
Fuckback Mountain?

822
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:50,376
- Too soon? A
Cock-in-Lips Now?

823
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,553
Next.

824
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:53,685
Cradle the balls.
Work the shaft.

825
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,852
Jerk my come-crayon
and let me color you white.

826
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,430
I need cock and I need it now.

827
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,229
I'm fucking you in the puss.

828
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:03,429
I'm fucking you in the puss.

829
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:05,730
It's 'puss' as in pussy.

830
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:10,208
Oh, because I was like,
who would wanna fuck puss?

831
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:14,860
I want to slam my
ham in your can,

832
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:16,745
woman. Scene.

833
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,357
- This guy is amazing.

834
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:20,481
This guy's great-looking too.

835
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:22,083
I wanna fuck him.

836
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:26,218
Hi, my name's Delaney
and I'm a producer.

837
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,046
I really don't know
what it means. I'm...

838
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:29,624
gonna be honest, this
is my first time.

839
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:31,998
You don't have to
worry, I'm not gonna...

840
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,962
touch you or
nothing like that.

841
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:37,061
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.

842
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,748
We're happy. I
mean, not happy,

843
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,753
but it's cool, you know.

844
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,140
Just so you know,
there will be some fucking.

845
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:49,037
- We'll talk about that
if you get the part.

846
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,212
Okay.

847
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:51,888
I mean, not-- We
won't be fucking,

848
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,515
there'll be fucking
in the movie.

849
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,284
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.

850
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:58,947
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.

851
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:03,755
It's my job as the producer
to see what you got.

852
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,127
So if that makes
you uncomfortable...

853
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:07,295
in any way,

854
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,475
you don't have to
show me anything...

855
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,398
you don't wanna
show me, because--

856
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,638
I love the movies.

857
00:37:16,643 --> 00:37:18,736
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.

858
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:21,073
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.

859
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:23,076
Yeah, but how are
zombies doing it...

860
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,246
at all sexy?

861
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:27,049
I want to eat your brain...

862
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,279
and your ass.

863
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,790
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.

864
00:37:32,926 --> 00:37:36,657
Yeah. Close Encounters
With a Turd From Behind.

865
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,451
- I don't know
what that means.

866
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,194
Just asses.

867
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,199
Fucking deep in asses.

868
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,334
What?

869
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:48,570
We're making a porno
and we just need to know...

870
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,737
what you would be
or would not be...

871
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:52,107
interested in doing.

872
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:54,112
If anything.

873
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:56,614
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.

874
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:58,713
Anal and hugging.

875
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:00,215
I don't do ass stuff.

876
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,620
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.

877
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:06,054
- Oh, wait, oral. I like anal.
- Yay.

878
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:07,226
Okay, well,

879
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:09,559
so, uh, do you have
any special skills?

880
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,729
Special skills?

881
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:15,666
I can get a boner really quick
and it sticks straight up.

882
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:17,463
- Is that really
a special skill?

883
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:17,899
I think.

884
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,663
- Can you show us
what you mean?

885
00:38:19,668 --> 00:38:21,668
Sure.

886
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:30,648
Oh, that is special.

887
00:38:31,718 --> 00:38:33,114
Yeah, you're hired, Mr. --...

888
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,050
- Who are you again?
- Lester.

889
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:37,546
Lester 'The Molester'
Cockinshtuff.

890
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:38,920
- No.
- Wow.

891
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,894
That is the best porn name
I've ever heard, man.

892
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,062
I can have a porn name?

893
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,064
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.

894
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:50,065
Are you Granny Panties?

895
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,095
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.

896
00:38:52,272 --> 00:38:54,002
The panties
are actually in the house.

897
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,203
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.

898
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,890
- Star Sex 2: The
Wrath of Cunt.

899
00:38:56,895 --> 00:38:58,895
We never made a Star Sex 1.

900
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:00,449
I guess we can
lose Star Sex 3:

901
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:01,743
The Search for Cock, then.

902
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:03,748
- Cocunt.
- What's that?

903
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:05,783
It's Cocoon with a cunt.

904
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:08,599
So Delaney tells us...

905
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:11,285
you have a special
talent of some sort.

906
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,926
I don't know if I'd call it
a special talent,

907
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:16,370
but it's a little
something I picked up...

908
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,792
doing bachelor parties.

909
00:39:17,797 --> 00:39:20,527
It would probably be easier
if I just showed you.

910
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,167
- Great.
- The floor is yours.

911
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:41,720
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.

912
00:39:52,065 --> 00:39:54,065
Holy fuck.

913
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:00,799
Her name, Bubbles.

914
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,209
- Invasion of the
Potty-Snatchers?

915
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:05,039
That's like MAD
Magazine stupid.

916
00:40:05,044 --> 00:40:07,045
Well, fuck you, okay?
You try to think...

917
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,050
of a good sci-fi porno
title. It's hard.

918
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:10,786
There's gotta be
one we haven't...

919
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,347
thought of that
would say it all,

920
00:40:12,352 --> 00:40:14,452
not be ridiculously filthy
and off-putting,

921
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:16,623
and still have
instant recognition...

922
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:18,628
with our audience.

923
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,292
- I got it.
- I got it.

924
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:24,228
- Star Whores.
- Yeah. It's funny, right?

925
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:25,972
See, we figured
this opens us up...

926
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:27,462
to an even bigger
sales market...

927
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,492
beyond the people we went
to school with.

928
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,599
People who like
comics and sci-fi.

929
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:33,535
Comics? Like 'Ziggy'?

930
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,663
'Ziggy'? Is that even
in fucking papers...

931
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:36,838
anymore? No, man.

932
00:40:36,843 --> 00:40:39,812
Fuck you.'Ziggy' is a comic,
right next to 'Family Circus.'

933
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,345
No, like Spider-Man and shit,
you know?

934
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:44,712
There's always a
shitload of Star Wars...

935
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:46,281
nerds at those
comic-book shows.

936
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,963
So we sell them a
Princess Leia...

937
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:49,918
they can really
fucking jerk off to.

938
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:52,601
- That'd be me,
Princess Lay-Her.

939
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:54,155
Who am I playing?

940
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
You, my friend,

941
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:57,618
are the lead role of
Lubed Guy-Baller.

942
00:40:57,797 --> 00:40:59,527
Man, he's gonna
be balling dudes?

943
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:01,591
I thought you said
this was boys on girls.

944
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:04,599
If I have to fuck a guy, okay,
but I'd rather fuck a girl.

945
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,468
What's wrong with you, boy?

946
00:41:06,473 --> 00:41:08,835
- We'll change the
name to Sky-Baller.

947
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,004
Sky-Baller.

948
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,068
I will be Hung So-low.

949
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:15,976
Delaney, my friend,
you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.

950
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:18,599
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.

951
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:20,695
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees
Bend-Over.

952
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,183
You're my only hump.

953
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,188
On the other hand,
fuck my wife.

954
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:26,016
Unfortunately,
On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over...

955
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,689
does not have any
sex in the movie...

956
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:32,495
but the droids do,
I-CUP and R2-T-Bag.

957
00:41:32,665 --> 00:41:35,099
I robot.

958
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:40,103
And Stacey over here
is gonna play Darth Vibrator.

959
00:41:40,273 --> 00:41:42,503
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.

960
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:43,372
I know that...

961
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,139
because I'm not
a fucking idiot.

962
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:46,184
In our movie,

963
00:41:46,189 --> 00:41:48,671
Darth Vibrator
is a bad girl...

964
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:50,512
who wants to fuck the galaxy,

965
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:53,124
literally, and it's up
to Lubed and Hung...

966
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:55,049
to stop her with their cocks.

967
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,889
- You and me get
to have sex, then?

968
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:57,285
Yeah.

969
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,884
- Cool.
- I know. Isn't that awesome?

970
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,243
Hold up, hold up. So
who's all having...

971
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:03,892
sex with who in this movie?

972
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:06,097
As of last night,
I was having sex with Zack.

973
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:08,809
What? Han Solo ain't
never had no sex...

974
00:42:08,814 --> 00:42:11,193
with Princess Leia
in the Star Wars.

975
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:13,839
Guys, this isn't
a literal adaptation here.

976
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:17,101
It's more of an
erotic re-imagining.

977
00:42:17,277 --> 00:42:19,714
Kind of like The Wiz
or like a parody.

978
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,042
With lots of anal.

979
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:23,709
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?

980
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:26,560
I have a question, do
Princess Lay-Her...

981
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:28,565
and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?

982
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:32,591
Uh, no, because
they're brother and sister,

983
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,857
and according to Miri,

984
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:35,590
brothers and
sisters can't fuck.

985
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,243
But you said,

986
00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:38,192
that this wasn't a
literal translation,

987
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:40,091
so that means
Lester's character...

988
00:42:40,096 --> 00:42:42,099
could have sex with
Miri's character.

989
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,278
Because I would love
to fucking eat...

990
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:46,398
her ass and fuck her
silly in the movie.

991
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:48,973
Dream on, pal,
it's never gonna happen, okay?

992
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:50,393
- No, I'm fine with it.

993
00:42:50,398 --> 00:42:52,140
See, she's fine-- Wait, what?

994
00:42:52,145 --> 00:42:53,936
Yep. I mean, everyone
else is having...

995
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:55,410
sex with more than
one person...

996
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:57,345
in this movie all of a sudden,

997
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,669
so I think it's, you know,

998
00:42:59,674 --> 00:43:02,617
not fair if I'm
only fucking you.

999
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,087
Guys, read amongst
yourselves, okay?

1000
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:06,921
Can I talk to you for a sec?

1001
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:08,926
Look, Miri,

1002
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:10,843
we got plenty of sex
going on in this...

1003
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:12,527
thing, you don't
have to do that.

1004
00:43:12,532 --> 00:43:14,372
Zack, it's fine. I
mean I have slept...

1005
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:16,264
with way worse-looking
guys than Lester.

1006
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,165
I just wanna do my
part for the movie...

1007
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,100
like everyone else.

1008
00:43:19,105 --> 00:43:20,628
You're having
sex in the movie,

1009
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:22,403
you don't need to
fuck someone else.

1010
00:43:22,408 --> 00:43:23,154
- You're good.

1011
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,872
I'm only fucking you, though.

1012
00:43:24,877 --> 00:43:28,677
So don't we need to vary it up
to keep it fair?

1013
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:31,146
Fair for--? I don't-- What?
Fair for who?

1014
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,065
What are these,

1015
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,848
blood diamonds
we're talking about?

1016
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:35,259
Fair for everyone else...

1017
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:37,289
who is fucking more
than one person,

1018
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:39,457
a.k.a. you, in the movie.

1019
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:40,525
- I mean, fine--

1020
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,688
All right. I mean,
if you don't care--

1021
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,679
I don't fucking care
if you fuck him.

1022
00:43:44,684 --> 00:43:45,960
Fuck. I don't give a shit.

1023
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:47,149
Like you said, you know,

1024
00:43:47,154 --> 00:43:49,130
you've fucked bigger
idiots than Lester.

1025
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:53,538
Holy shit. Are we really gonna
shoot this in outer space?

1026
00:43:53,706 --> 00:43:55,706
Maybe not bigger idiots.

1027
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:44,989
Thank you.

1028
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:13,105
- Cut. All right,
guys, that's it.

1029
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,281
Yeah.

1030
00:45:14,286 --> 00:45:16,064
Make sure you leave
your costume...

1031
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:18,069
so we know they're
here for tomorrow.

1032
00:45:18,123 --> 00:45:20,177
Mostly, everybody,
thank you so much...

1033
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:22,182
for helping us get
ready, you know.

1034
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:24,257
Cleaning this place
out, building the...

1035
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:26,262
sets, sewing the
costumes, it's just--

1036
00:45:26,398 --> 00:45:28,398
I mean, it's really
amazing. Thank you.

1037
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,896
Seriously, thanks.

1038
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:32,193
But this is just
the beginning, guys.

1039
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:34,304
If Star Whores
works, and it will,

1040
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:36,495
we are set up for
sequels galore.

1041
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,071
The Empire Strikes Ass.

1042
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,772
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.

1043
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:44,438
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.

1044
00:45:46,585 --> 00:45:48,951
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.

1045
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:52,352
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.

1046
00:45:52,691 --> 00:45:53,887
Ew.

1047
00:45:53,892 --> 00:45:56,556
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.

1048
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:59,111
We're gonna have a lot of fun,
but more importantly,

1049
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,194
we're gonna make
a lot of fucking money, okay?

1050
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:01,557
- Yeah.

1051
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:03,363
So get ready for
greatness, people.

1052
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:05,198
Tomorrow we start
principal photography.

1053
00:46:05,203 --> 00:46:07,364
- Whoo.
- Yeah.

1054
00:46:07,672 --> 00:46:09,439
- All right, good
night, you guys.

1055
00:46:09,444 --> 00:46:11,444
We got a movie.

1056
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,146
- What?
- Nothing.

1057
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:18,151
I think someone
should acknowledge...

1058
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:20,080
how insane and
amazing this is...

1059
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:21,646
- and it's all because of you.

1060
00:46:21,651 --> 00:46:23,483
I don't know. It's
just a porno.

1061
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:25,025
You know what I mean.

1062
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,447
You've really come
into your own.

1063
00:46:28,693 --> 00:46:30,693
Shut the fuck up.

1064
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,204
So speaking of
coming into things,

1065
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:35,209
ready for tomorrow?
Twenty years,

1066
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,183
we're finally gonna
know what it's like...

1067
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:38,398
to have sex with each other.

1068
00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:40,066
You say that like
you've been wondering...

1069
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:41,649
what it'd be like
to sleep with me...

1070
00:46:41,654 --> 00:46:42,335
for a while now.

1071
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,588
Why the fuck do you think

1072
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,138
I started hanging
out with you?

1073
00:46:45,143 --> 00:46:49,136
I knew it. Here, help.

1074
00:46:52,717 --> 00:46:55,097
Let's just promise
that it's not gonna...

1075
00:46:55,102 --> 00:46:57,102
change anything
between us, okay?

1076
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,385
- Like what?
- I don't know.

1077
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,585
Some guys
can't keep sex in perspective.

1078
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:02,165
If anyone's gotta keep this...

1079
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,623
in perspective,
it's you, okay?

1080
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:05,628
I don't want you
getting all mushy...

1081
00:47:05,628 --> 00:47:06,760
and gooey on me...

1082
00:47:06,765 --> 00:47:08,456
after I give you
the best orgasm...

1083
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:09,396
you've ever had.

1084
00:47:09,401 --> 00:47:11,138
Oh, like you know
what you're doing...

1085
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:11,965
down there at all.

1086
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,929
I actually don't.
Where's the clitoris?

1087
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:15,001
Is it in your ass?

1088
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:15,806
Just, you know,

1089
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:17,811
make sure you kind
of whoop it up...

1090
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:20,044
and act like I'm a
stud who knows...

1091
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:22,243
what he's doing,
okay? Just be a pal.

1092
00:47:22,414 --> 00:47:24,386
Oh, dude, I am gonna
Meryl Streep the...

1093
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:26,391
fuck out of this
tomorrow, you watch.

1094
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,017
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1095
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,420
No. Really, thank you.

1096
00:47:36,428 --> 00:47:38,428
For everything.

1097
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:42,131
You're welcome.

1098
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:49,185
Less than 12 hours...

1099
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,004
and we make
Monroeville history.

1100
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:53,390
- I really hope
nothing goes wrong.

1101
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:55,708
It's a movie. What
could go wrong?

1102
00:48:04,522 --> 00:48:06,717
What are you doing?

1103
00:48:08,627 --> 00:48:10,788
- What's up?
- What the fuck?

1104
00:48:10,962 --> 00:48:12,459
What are you doing?

1105
00:48:12,464 --> 00:48:14,489
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.

1106
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:16,666
- Wait.
- Stop. Stop.

1107
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:20,964
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?

1108
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,455
Condos is what's going on,

1109
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,404
as soon as this
shit-hole's demo'd.

1110
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:26,039
No, you gotta stop
it right now.

1111
00:48:26,044 --> 00:48:27,691
We rented this
place for a month...

1112
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,575
from Mr. Jenkins.

1113
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,830
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins
was full of shit.

1114
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,417
Luxury Homesteads
bought this place a month ago.

1115
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:35,448
I'm gonna kill that
lying old fuck.

1116
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:37,030
You're gonna have
to go Florida,

1117
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:38,118
that's where he moved.

1118
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,520
We've got thousands of dollars
of equipment in there.

1119
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:41,525
- Please.

1120
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,290
If you wanna sift
through this rubble...

1121
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,164
when we're done, be my guest.

1122
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:47,231
Hey, get that
fucking beam down.

1123
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:06,812
This is the last thing
you wanna hear.

1124
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,515
If you don't get an advance.

1125
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,120
I don't think we're gonna keep
a roof over our heads.

1126
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,887
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.

1127
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,858
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?

1128
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:19,821
Never mind what my
wife's gonna do...

1129
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:21,695
when there ain't
no new snow tires,

1130
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,635
or when she sees
I charged a video camera.

1131
00:49:24,803 --> 00:49:26,803
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this, man.

1132
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,838
I just wanted to see
some free titties.

1133
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:32,614
That's all. But there's
no such thing...

1134
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:35,210
as free titties,
is there, Zack?

1135
00:49:36,314 --> 00:49:38,509
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.

1136
00:49:38,683 --> 00:49:40,281
Why don't we get
another camera,

1137
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:41,548
and shoot something else?

1138
00:49:41,553 --> 00:49:44,103
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?

1139
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,194
Sound stage? We had
a shit-covered...

1140
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:48,199
garage we turned
into a sound stage.

1141
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,022
We find someplace new
and we do it again.

1142
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:53,994
How? Okay, I'm broke, man.

1143
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:58,493
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.

1144
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,104
I have to get another job
to pay Delaney back.

1145
00:50:01,272 --> 00:50:02,552
So please tell me,

1146
00:50:02,557 --> 00:50:04,764
how can I afford
to start over?

1147
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:07,240
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh--?

1148
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:10,612
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, 3.50.

1149
00:50:10,782 --> 00:50:12,832
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

1150
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:15,041
I mean, I'm a total loser...

1151
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:18,082
in every single other
aspect of my life.

1152
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:20,306
What made me think
I could do something...

1153
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:22,288
as simple as filming
people fucking?

1154
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:25,091
We have no money left,
nowhere to shoot, no sets,

1155
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:27,527
we have no fucking
cameras. Here.

1156
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,900
It's time I go back
to my regular life...

1157
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,802
where I am a quiet fuckup...

1158
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:36,097
who doesn't cost
anybody any money...

1159
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:39,368
and knows his goddamn position
behind this fucking counter...

1160
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:42,672
making cappuccinos
for this fucking guy.

1161
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:50,283
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1162
00:50:55,794 --> 00:50:57,794
What are you doing?

1163
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,230
Oh, yeah.

1164
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,266
Yeah.

1165
00:51:08,606 --> 00:51:10,606
Fuck, yes.

1166
00:51:12,977 --> 00:51:14,977
Zack.

1167
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:39,276
You sneaky Indian
motherfucker.

1168
00:51:39,281 --> 00:51:41,281
I tell you, yes.

1169
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,166
Swallow My Cockuccino.

1170
00:51:45,343 --> 00:51:48,039
- What?
- That's it. That's the movie.

1171
00:51:48,213 --> 00:51:50,031
Why didn't I think
of it before?

1172
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:51,911
We don't need sets or a stage.

1173
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:53,866
Look at all this
production value,

1174
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:55,648
waiting to have balls on it.

1175
00:51:55,653 --> 00:51:56,919
Hold up. You wanna shoot...

1176
00:51:56,924 --> 00:51:58,518
a dirty movie here,
where we work?

1177
00:51:58,523 --> 00:51:59,686
Yes.

1178
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:01,534
Fuck, yes, I do.
You know how many...

1179
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:03,356
stories I have
from working here?

1180
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:07,320
How many times I've been laid
right there after hours?

1181
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,295
You've never gotten laid here
after hours.

1182
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,393
I know. Thank you
for reminding me.

1183
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:13,447
But I always wish I had,

1184
00:52:13,452 --> 00:52:16,506
and that's what porno
is. It's fantasy.

1185
00:52:16,674 --> 00:52:18,823
It's taking the normal...

1186
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:22,010
and making it abnormal
by fucking it.

1187
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:22,924
Don't do that.

1188
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:24,744
The little dog
don't like that.

1189
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:26,346
How did you get a camera?

1190
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,816
By being a terrible,
untrustworthy...

1191
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:30,821
employee, that's how.

1192
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:33,451
Give me today, I'll
bang out a script.

1193
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:35,586
Meet me back here
after closing.

1194
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,306
We're gonna launch
arching ropes of...

1195
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:40,925
jism all over this
motherfucker. Peace.

1196
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,589
I like that guy but
if he tries to...

1197
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,594
fuck that little dog
tonight for real.

1198
00:52:46,704 --> 00:52:48,865
I'm calling the
Humane Society.

1199
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:52,549
It's called Bean-N-Gone,

1200
00:52:52,554 --> 00:52:55,011
so get the fuck out
of here. Hey, Barry.

1201
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:02,840
- Stand by, Stace,
picture's up.

1202
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:04,017
Okay.

1203
00:53:04,022 --> 00:53:06,022
Roll tape.

1204
00:53:08,726 --> 00:53:11,786
Swallow My Cockuccino,
Scene 12, Take 1.

1205
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:21,831
And action.

1206
00:53:29,981 --> 00:53:33,576
I'd like a double espresso
so I can stay up all night...

1207
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,276
because I'm in
the mood to fuck.

1208
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:38,761
Well, I am a
whore-ista, so I love...

1209
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:40,948
to fuck. Would you
like to fuck me?

1210
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:42,601
Holy fuck. You mean,

1211
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:45,118
after you're done
with your shift?

1212
00:53:45,296 --> 00:53:48,265
I mean during my shift.

1213
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:51,431
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.

1214
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,003
With your shaft.

1215
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:08,048
Let us fuck.

1216
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:14,056
Cue music.

1217
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,031
Okay, open up to camera,
guys. Let us see it.

1218
00:54:25,503 --> 00:54:27,503
More tongue.

1219
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:31,807
Little less tongue.

1220
00:54:35,613 --> 00:54:37,613
Oh, that was good.

1221
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:45,288
Cue effects.

1222
00:55:01,706 --> 00:55:04,106
Oh, yeah, like that.

1223
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:06,368
Oh, yeah.

1224
00:55:07,545 --> 00:55:09,012
See, I told you it would work.

1225
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:10,777
Didn't I tell you?
It looks amazing.

1226
00:55:10,782 --> 00:55:12,782
It's incredible.

1227
00:55:12,884 --> 00:55:15,546
Oh, the beans hurt. Easy.

1228
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:18,720
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.

1229
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,320
That's why we got him.

1230
00:55:20,325 --> 00:55:23,590
- Nice. I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.

1231
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:27,094
- Come on.
- Like that? Like that.

1232
00:55:27,265 --> 00:55:30,860
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Look at that.

1233
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:33,035
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.

1234
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:35,071
No, not you, Lester.
Put it back in.

1235
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:37,173
Kiss the muscle.

1236
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:39,375
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.

1237
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:41,507
- Can he slap
her ass a little?

1238
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:43,176
Don't be a fucking
pervert, dude.

1239
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:47,117
- Stir, come on. Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.

1240
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:50,214
Stir it, baby.

1241
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,030
Hey.

1242
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,196
- Holy.
- Shit.

1243
00:56:03,201 --> 00:56:05,396
Are you guys still open?

1244
00:56:06,971 --> 00:56:10,907
No. We close at 9.

1245
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,938
I need coffee so
I'm drive home.

1246
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,540
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1247
00:56:18,883 --> 00:56:21,044
That's a cute kitty.

1248
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,719
Okay.

1249
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:31,324
Hey.

1250
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:33,159
- Hey.
- Hey.

1251
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:36,930
You guys see the
game? I was at it.

1252
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:39,304
Fucking Roethlisberger,

1253
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:42,471
the quarterback,
was all fucking,

1254
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,403
'Hug it, chug it,
football. All night.'

1255
00:56:47,408 --> 00:56:48,574
Heh-heh.

1256
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,911
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.

1257
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:51,925
- I love you.

1258
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,613
I love you too.
Have a good one.

1259
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,883
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.

1260
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,985
Oh.

1261
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,754
- Okay. Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.

1262
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,788
Go Steelers.

1263
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:12,432
Action.

1264
00:57:12,437 --> 00:57:16,464
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, like that.

1265
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:20,439
Oh, fuck it, chuck
it, football.

1266
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:21,874
Oh, yeah.

1267
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:23,879
Oh, God, this is good.

1268
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:32,152
You take it. You take it.
Take it, Barry. Oh, take it.

1269
00:57:32,322 --> 00:57:35,314
Take it, Barry. Take it.

1270
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,526
I'm disturbed
at how turned on I am by this.

1271
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,427
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.

1272
00:57:42,432 --> 00:57:44,525
Okay, that's a wrap,
everybody, yeah.

1273
00:57:44,701 --> 00:57:46,352
Let's give a hand
to our hotties...

1274
00:57:46,357 --> 00:57:47,866
with the bodies
from last night.

1275
00:57:47,871 --> 00:57:50,362
Stacey, Lester,
Bubbles, Barry, whoo.

1276
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,803
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1277
00:57:51,808 --> 00:57:53,772
Okay, when we come
back tonight,

1278
00:57:53,777 --> 00:57:55,813
we finish up the
venti-vulva scene, and...

1279
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:57,776
then we get into me
and Miri's stuff.

1280
00:57:57,781 --> 00:58:00,287
Again, amazing first
night, everybody.

1281
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:02,292
Thank you so much.

1282
00:58:04,588 --> 00:58:06,783
Let us fuck.

1283
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,460
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?

1284
00:58:12,462 --> 00:58:14,893
It looked like shit
going into other shit,

1285
00:58:14,898 --> 00:58:16,061
in focus.

1286
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:17,953
What an artist. That
was Kurosawa's...

1287
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,865
motto.'Shit going
into other shit.'

1288
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:20,270
Oh, man,

1289
00:58:20,275 --> 00:58:22,200
I can't believe
you gotta work now.

1290
00:58:22,205 --> 00:58:25,105
It's okay. You know, honestly,
I don't think I could sleep.

1291
00:58:25,175 --> 00:58:27,323
- I'm pretty, like,
pumped up right now.

1292
00:58:27,328 --> 00:58:28,673
Right? It was amazing.

1293
00:58:28,678 --> 00:58:29,219
It was awesome.

1294
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:30,742
I think the cast and
crew had a good time.

1295
00:58:30,747 --> 00:58:33,297
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.

1296
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,884
I just wanna keep shooting
people boning all day.

1297
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:37,797
I don't think I've ever met...

1298
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:39,802
the ambitious Zack
Brown before.

1299
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:42,297
- Well, I'm trying to
pay the bills, so...

1300
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:44,302
It's not a bad thing.

1301
00:58:44,594 --> 00:58:46,755
I think it looks good on you.

1302
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:37,946
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.

1303
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:40,345
Wait a minute.

1304
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,162
- You guys never
did it before?

1305
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,214
It's fine.

1306
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:48,384
You know, we talked about it
and it's just for the movie.

1307
00:59:48,558 --> 00:59:50,708
We're friends, you know,
we're just friends.

1308
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:54,595
And we will always just be
just friends, so...

1309
00:59:54,764 --> 00:59:58,131
Listen, I have some extra lube
from last night.

1310
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:00,291
I understand it's kind
of hard getting...

1311
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:01,866
wet when everyone's watching.

1312
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:03,871
At least it was for Barry.

1313
01:00:03,873 --> 01:00:05,803
- I don't know if
I am gonna need it.

1314
01:00:05,808 --> 01:00:06,972
Really?

1315
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:10,435
Yeah, I think
I'm just excited.

1316
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,611
Uh-huh.

1317
01:00:12,616 --> 01:00:14,170
At the idea of
people watching,

1318
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:15,347
not because of Zack.

1319
01:00:15,352 --> 01:00:17,140
Oh, God. Zack could
never have that...

1320
01:00:17,145 --> 01:00:18,650
effect on me in
a million years.

1321
01:00:18,655 --> 01:00:21,215
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.

1322
01:00:21,391 --> 01:00:22,587
Wow.

1323
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:24,556
- Your face.
- Yeah. Weird, huh?

1324
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,259
I don't think I've
seen your face...

1325
01:00:26,264 --> 01:00:27,125
since senior year.

1326
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:28,460
I think I made a mistake.

1327
01:00:28,465 --> 01:00:30,105
I did it for you
so you wouldn't...

1328
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:31,563
get road rash
during our scene,

1329
01:00:31,568 --> 01:00:33,066
but I should have asked first,

1330
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:35,071
I look like a
fucking beluga whale.

1331
01:00:35,138 --> 01:00:37,732
I think I'll be going now.

1332
01:00:39,142 --> 01:00:41,142
Okay.

1333
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,673
All I keep thinking is...

1334
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,115
we should've done
a trial run...

1335
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,750
at home last week
or something.

1336
01:00:51,755 --> 01:00:53,755
- Oh, my God. Right?
- I know.

1337
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:59,042
- You're still cool to
do it, though, right?

1338
01:00:59,047 --> 01:01:01,061
Yeah, um. Totally. Are you?

1339
01:01:01,231 --> 01:01:03,358
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm, uh...

1340
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:05,362
- Honestly, I'm a little
nervous, I guess.

1341
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:06,364
You are?

1342
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:08,667
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?

1343
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:10,119
Yeah, you know,

1344
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,774
it's our first
time together...

1345
01:01:14,177 --> 01:01:18,443
since our auspicious debut
on viral video.

1346
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:20,845
Oh, yeah.

1347
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:23,080
That's a fuckload of pressure
for a director.

1348
01:01:23,586 --> 01:01:25,311
As a director,
please. What about...

1349
01:01:25,316 --> 01:01:27,285
the anxiety I'm
feeling as an actress?

1350
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,928
- Did I pick the
right project?

1351
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,789
Yeah. What about
this follow-up?

1352
01:01:30,794 --> 01:01:32,586
Julia Roberts followed
Pretty Woman...

1353
01:01:32,591 --> 01:01:33,958
with Sleeping With the Enemy.

1354
01:01:33,963 --> 01:01:36,898
I'm following Granny Panties
with Swallow My Cockuccino.

1355
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:37,992
Only difference is...

1356
01:01:37,997 --> 01:01:39,497
this movie's about
cock-sucking...

1357
01:01:39,502 --> 01:01:41,179
and her movie
just sucked cock,

1358
01:01:41,184 --> 01:01:41,733
period.

1359
01:01:41,738 --> 01:01:44,764
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.

1360
01:01:45,408 --> 01:01:47,408
I liked that.

1361
01:01:48,845 --> 01:01:51,370
- When she kills him.
- with a gun.

1362
01:01:51,548 --> 01:01:52,844
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1363
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:55,399
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.

1364
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:57,418
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.

1365
01:01:59,556 --> 01:02:01,820
So I guess we should do this.

1366
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:04,248
I think we should
probably wait just...

1367
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:06,394
until I lose another
20 or 30 pounds.

1368
01:02:06,563 --> 01:02:09,464
Stop it. You look good.

1369
01:02:09,632 --> 01:02:11,632
Thanks.

1370
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:16,568
So, what about
me? How do I look?

1371
01:02:17,774 --> 01:02:21,437
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful,

1372
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:24,111
so I guess it's
not a big deal,

1373
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:26,116
but you look amazing.

1374
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:37,988
- Okay. Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.

1375
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:42,997
Swallow My Cockuccino,
Scene 8, Take 1.

1376
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,634
- Come here.
- I'm over--?

1377
01:02:46,302 --> 01:02:48,302
All right, settle.

1378
01:02:48,938 --> 01:02:50,938
Action.

1379
01:02:51,975 --> 01:02:54,341
Who could it be?

1380
01:03:01,584 --> 01:03:02,914
- Hi.
- Hi.

1381
01:03:02,919 --> 01:03:06,377
I'm a delivery man
and I have some cream for you.

1382
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:10,048
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.

1383
01:03:10,226 --> 01:03:11,823
I work out.

1384
01:03:11,828 --> 01:03:16,026
So do you want me
to give you your cream now?

1385
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:19,965
I've been waiting
for it all day.

1386
01:03:21,037 --> 01:03:22,233
- Fuck. Come on.
- Oops.

1387
01:03:22,238 --> 01:03:23,968
Keep going.

1388
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:28,410
I spilled my cream.
Do you mind?

1389
01:03:28,578 --> 01:03:29,936
I don't mind.

1390
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:33,914
Especially if you
spill it on my face.

1391
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,409
Let us fuck.

1392
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:44,430
- Fix my shirt.
Think I should?

1393
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:44,889
Okay.

1394
01:03:44,894 --> 01:03:47,988
Let me see them titties.

1395
01:03:48,431 --> 01:03:49,970
Actually, you
know what? Sorry.

1396
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:51,663
I don't think we
should show them.

1397
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:52,089
- What?

1398
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,094
We shouldn't show
your breasts.

1399
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:56,147
- Aren't you gonna
take your shirt off?

1400
01:03:56,152 --> 01:03:57,368
I'm just gonna open it.

1401
01:03:57,373 --> 01:03:59,304
You're not gonna take
it off? Why not?

1402
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:02,244
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.

1403
01:04:02,412 --> 01:04:03,910
She's not gonna show her tits?

1404
01:04:03,915 --> 01:04:05,543
I showed my cock
and my asshole.

1405
01:04:05,548 --> 01:04:08,048
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.

1406
01:04:08,051 --> 01:04:10,451
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?

1407
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,536
I can't believe this.
I was delivering...

1408
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:15,887
cream, and look
what's happening.

1409
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:18,617
- Jesus, what is
that, a rumba?

1410
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,024
What's a rumba?

1411
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:22,029
That awkward movement.

1412
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:25,554
- Should I take your
underpants off?

1413
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,559
Yeah, take them off.

1414
01:04:29,606 --> 01:04:31,236
What the fuck?
How does this work?

1415
01:04:31,241 --> 01:04:33,241
They're just
like-- I'll do it.

1416
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:35,288
- I'll do mine, you
just-- You do yours.

1417
01:04:35,293 --> 01:04:37,293
I'll do my pants.

1418
01:04:45,188 --> 01:04:47,418
Granny panties.

1419
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:51,292
Just get on with it already.

1420
01:04:52,428 --> 01:04:54,428
I'm gonna fuck you
with my pecker.

1421
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:56,427
Dude, that's really dirty.

1422
01:04:56,432 --> 01:04:58,432
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.

1423
01:04:58,601 --> 01:05:00,601
- Penis?
- Fine.

1424
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:02,828
- I'm gonna fuck
you with my penis.

1425
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,002
I can't wait.

1426
01:05:04,007 --> 01:05:06,007
For my penis.

1427
01:05:06,009 --> 01:05:07,826
Be careful, Miri.
Okay, there we go.

1428
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:09,607
Just keep rolling,
keep rolling.

1429
01:05:09,612 --> 01:05:14,276
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.

1430
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,980
This is the worst porno
I've ever seen.

1431
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:25,987
- Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.

1432
01:05:28,197 --> 01:05:29,394
- You okay?
- Yup.

1433
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:30,573
- Okay, all right.

1434
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,732
Just leave them.
Just leave them.

1435
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:35,533
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.

1436
01:05:35,538 --> 01:05:37,398
- You gotta get
your-- There you go.

1437
01:05:37,403 --> 01:05:37,969
Okay, okay.

1438
01:05:37,974 --> 01:05:40,272
- Okay, okay.
- Okay. This okay?

1439
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,010
Okay.

1440
01:05:46,015 --> 01:05:47,845
Okay, uh.

1441
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:49,712
- We'll start kissing
on three, okay?

1442
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:50,882
Okay.

1443
01:05:50,887 --> 01:05:54,448
One, two, three. Go.

1444
01:06:18,081 --> 01:06:20,081
I'm ready.

1445
01:06:20,883 --> 01:06:24,410
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

1446
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:34,759
Deacon.

1447
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:36,994
- Deacon. Deacon.
- What?

1448
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:39,008
Did you see Lost
this week, man?

1449
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:40,732
I missed it. What happened?

1450
01:06:40,737 --> 01:06:42,657
They're on the island,
off the island.

1451
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:43,835
Who can follow that?

1452
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,136
I think they're in hell.

1453
01:06:45,141 --> 01:06:47,141
Would you all shut
the motherfuck up?

1454
01:07:01,924 --> 01:07:03,721
I want you to come.

1455
01:07:03,726 --> 01:07:06,695
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.

1456
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:13,831
Oh, God.

1457
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:31,444
Oh, God.

1458
01:07:44,233 --> 01:07:45,563
Cut.

1459
01:07:45,568 --> 01:07:47,968
That's it? It's over? Ain't he...

1460
01:07:47,973 --> 01:07:50,301
supposed to come
on her titties?

1461
01:07:55,411 --> 01:07:57,309
Well, it wasn't what
we'd shot-listed,

1462
01:07:57,314 --> 01:07:58,209
but that was nice.

1463
01:07:58,214 --> 01:08:00,842
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.

1464
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:03,212
Thanks, Lester, uh.

1465
01:08:03,419 --> 01:08:05,341
It wasn't just me,
though, guys. Give...

1466
01:08:05,346 --> 01:08:07,346
it up for my radiant
costar here, Miri.

1467
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:10,619
- Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.

1468
01:08:10,793 --> 01:08:13,043
Let's move out,
start lighting the next scene.

1469
01:08:13,062 --> 01:08:15,062
- All right.
- Let's do it.

1470
01:08:15,631 --> 01:08:17,631
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.

1471
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:19,783
I thought they were gonna
be fucking hard.

1472
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:21,632
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.

1473
01:08:21,637 --> 01:08:23,662
- Good job.
- Thanks.

1474
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:26,937
You good, Mir?
You need anything?

1475
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:29,110
I'm just gonna take
a minute, okay?

1476
01:08:29,178 --> 01:08:32,545
Okay, uh. I'll
just be out there.

1477
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:35,349
Yeah.

1478
01:08:36,419 --> 01:08:39,946
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.

1479
01:08:41,824 --> 01:08:44,292
'Fun.' You fucking douche.

1480
01:09:10,086 --> 01:09:12,086
Wow.

1481
01:09:26,936 --> 01:09:28,566
- Hey.
- Hey.

1482
01:09:28,571 --> 01:09:29,965
- You working on a rewrite?

1483
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:31,569
Yeah, just for
tonight's scene.

1484
01:09:31,574 --> 01:09:33,163
- I'm ready to go
when you are, though.

1485
01:09:33,168 --> 01:09:35,168
Okay.

1486
01:09:35,912 --> 01:09:38,658
You know, before we go, I...

1487
01:09:38,663 --> 01:09:42,784
I'm thinking that, uh,
it's a good idea...

1488
01:09:43,352 --> 01:09:45,402
if we talk about
what happened last night.

1489
01:09:47,023 --> 01:09:48,023
- Oh.

1490
01:09:48,028 --> 01:09:49,887
I mean, we don't have
to, but I think--

1491
01:09:49,892 --> 01:09:51,222
Okay, yeah, uh.

1492
01:09:51,227 --> 01:09:52,802
I kind of dropped
the ball on that.

1493
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:53,391
I guess, huh?

1494
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:57,264
- No, no. It's...
- To be honest, it was...

1495
01:09:57,433 --> 01:10:00,183
You know, I didn't realize
how weird it would be for me.

1496
01:10:00,203 --> 01:10:02,932
Weird? Like-- Weird how?

1497
01:10:03,572 --> 01:10:05,540
Acting and directing
at the same time.

1498
01:10:05,545 --> 01:10:07,370
It's a lot to
process, you know.

1499
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:09,488
For the first time,
I thought my balls...

1500
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:11,308
didn't have enough
hair on them.

1501
01:10:11,313 --> 01:10:13,313
That's not what I meant.

1502
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,608
I know what you meant.

1503
01:10:16,785 --> 01:10:18,785
How you feeling about it?

1504
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:21,154
I guess, um...

1505
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:24,557
I feel like...

1506
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,460
Like we...

1507
01:10:28,096 --> 01:10:29,096
- Holy fuck.

1508
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:31,429
The power's on.
Did you do this?

1509
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,600
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.

1510
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:35,398
How could we have done that?

1511
01:10:35,403 --> 01:10:37,403
- The water.
- The water.

1512
01:10:37,772 --> 01:10:40,240
Come on, come on, come on.

1513
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:41,905
Yeah.

1514
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,817
- We can shower in
our home again.

1515
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,822
We are liquid.

1516
01:10:50,485 --> 01:10:51,681
Greetings.

1517
01:10:51,686 --> 01:10:53,455
Have you heard the
good news about...

1518
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,185
our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ?

1519
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,987
Oh, my God, did
you guys do this?

1520
01:10:56,992 --> 01:10:58,742
We got tired of you
taking showers...

1521
01:10:58,747 --> 01:11:00,023
at our places all the time.

1522
01:11:00,028 --> 01:11:02,228
So we took up a collection
amongst ourselves.

1523
01:11:02,297 --> 01:11:04,347
And chipped away
at your mountain of debt.

1524
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:06,616
You guys paid off
our massive utilities bills?

1525
01:11:06,635 --> 01:11:07,966
- How did you afford that?

1526
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:09,866
I stole my old lady's
bingo winnings.

1527
01:11:09,871 --> 01:11:10,947
And Mistress Bubbles...

1528
01:11:10,952 --> 01:11:12,402
did a bachelor
party tonight...

1529
01:11:12,407 --> 01:11:14,521
at which yours truly
was a guest star,

1530
01:11:14,526 --> 01:11:15,805
thank you very much.

1531
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,107
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1532
01:11:17,112 --> 01:11:19,180
Don't get too excited.
We didn't pay off...

1533
01:11:19,185 --> 01:11:21,044
your whole bill. Just
a month of each.

1534
01:11:21,049 --> 01:11:23,049
They agreed
to turn everything back on?

1535
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:24,981
At 9 at night? How
does that work?

1536
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:27,750
Stacey knows somebody
that works at Power and Light.

1537
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,922
- You guys...
- This is amazing.

1538
01:11:30,058 --> 01:11:31,721
You didn't have to do this.

1539
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:33,726
You didn't have to put us
in your movie.

1540
01:11:33,728 --> 01:11:35,728
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.

1541
01:11:35,764 --> 01:11:37,473
- Or put us in
your movie either.

1542
01:11:37,478 --> 01:11:38,561
We said that already.

1543
01:11:38,566 --> 01:11:40,693
Guys, honestly,
I don't know what to say.

1544
01:11:40,869 --> 01:11:43,166
You can start by saying
we can take tonight off...

1545
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:45,401
so we can have our wrap party
right now.

1546
01:11:45,573 --> 01:11:46,771
Guys, we're not wrapped.

1547
01:11:46,776 --> 01:11:48,826
We still have four
days of shooting left.

1548
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:51,572
Excuse me.
In my 'producorial' capacity.

1549
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:53,951
I'm shutting the movie
down for a night...

1550
01:11:53,956 --> 01:11:55,956
so we can get a little silly.

1551
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:04,919
¶ 'PARTY UP (UP IN HERE)'
by DMX ¶...

1552
01:12:29,818 --> 01:12:33,652
¶ 'HEY' by THE PIXIES ¶

1553
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,584
Go, go, go.

1554
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:42,821
- Yes.
- Yes.

1555
01:12:44,366 --> 01:12:45,829
You all drink.

1556
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:47,351
Was it just amazing with him,

1557
01:12:47,356 --> 01:12:49,356
after all those
years of not knowing?

1558
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:52,668
It was, um, weird.

1559
01:12:53,575 --> 01:12:54,198
- But good.

1560
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,072
My scene with Zack's tomorrow.

1561
01:12:56,077 --> 01:12:57,640
You don't say.

1562
01:12:57,645 --> 01:13:00,149
But I'm a little nervous.
I was thinking...

1563
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:02,309
about trying to get
with him tonight.

1564
01:13:02,484 --> 01:13:05,009
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.

1565
01:13:05,186 --> 01:13:06,619
You are just friends and all,

1566
01:13:06,624 --> 01:13:08,551
so I didn't think it
would be a biggie.

1567
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:09,815
- It wouldn't be a
biggie, would it?

1568
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,755
No.

1569
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,753
No, no. It's not a
biggie. What? No.

1570
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,627
Are you sure?

1571
01:13:17,632 --> 01:13:18,391
Yeah. Stacey,

1572
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:20,396
I'm not married
to the guy, so...

1573
01:13:20,502 --> 01:13:23,342
I don't know. You
guys just looked...

1574
01:13:23,347 --> 01:13:25,496
kind of intimate last night.

1575
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:28,141
- We did?
- Yeah.

1576
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:35,376
Well, we're just
better actors than

1577
01:13:35,381 --> 01:13:38,477
I thought, I think,
so you know what?

1578
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:41,850
If you wanna get with him,
you should just go ask him.

1579
01:13:42,023 --> 01:13:44,075
- He'd be really
excited to hear that.

1580
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,922
Yeah? For real,
you don't mind?

1581
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,953
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1582
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:56,135
All the quarters
are on the ground.

1583
01:13:56,838 --> 01:13:59,636
- Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.

1584
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:07,608
Come on,
are you guys playing or what?

1585
01:15:48,483 --> 01:15:50,951
Well, I'm bummed,
but I totally get it.

1586
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:52,429
It's no problem to work...

1587
01:15:52,434 --> 01:15:54,434
with Lester again.
He has a nice cock.

1588
01:15:54,522 --> 01:15:56,352
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.

1589
01:15:56,357 --> 01:15:58,268
Oh, but if I start
making weird faces...

1590
01:15:58,273 --> 01:15:59,789
or anything during the scene,

1591
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:02,388
it's just because
I've been constipated all day.

1592
01:16:02,564 --> 01:16:05,533
Oh, shit, uh. We don't have
to shoot the scene tonight.

1593
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,431
No, I want to. Anal's great
for when you're constipated.

1594
01:16:08,436 --> 01:16:10,768
It totally loosens you up.

1595
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:14,305
I use ex-lax,
but good to know.

1596
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:15,897
Okay, I never thought

1597
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:18,002
I would have that
conversation.

1598
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:19,158
So are we starting...

1599
01:16:19,163 --> 01:16:20,610
with Lester and
Stacey tonight?

1600
01:16:20,615 --> 01:16:22,645
We were supposed to start
with Lester and Miri.

1601
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:24,548
I know. She-- We're
not gonna do that.

1602
01:16:24,553 --> 01:16:26,553
I don't think Miri's gonna...

1603
01:16:33,428 --> 01:16:35,428
...do that.

1604
01:16:37,799 --> 01:16:40,525
Hey. So where are
we shooting this?

1605
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,265
Over here?

1606
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:45,137
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.

1607
01:16:46,507 --> 01:16:48,634
Our scene's tonight, right?

1608
01:16:50,712 --> 01:16:53,237
Can I talk to you for a minute
in the back?

1609
01:16:53,748 --> 01:16:56,842
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1610
01:16:58,586 --> 01:17:00,450
What do you want
me to shoot here?

1611
01:17:00,455 --> 01:17:02,243
Start with the
close-ups of Lester...

1612
01:17:02,248 --> 01:17:04,248
and Stacey. Give
me a second, man.

1613
01:17:04,592 --> 01:17:06,389
What an artist.

1614
01:17:06,394 --> 01:17:10,160
Okay, uh. Did I do something
wrong to you?

1615
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:12,061
No.

1616
01:17:12,066 --> 01:17:13,329
Then why are you here?

1617
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:14,947
I'm here for the same reason...

1618
01:17:14,952 --> 01:17:16,952
you're here. To
make the movie.

1619
01:17:17,205 --> 01:17:18,378
Okay, just, like,

1620
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,732
for your own personal
information,

1621
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:23,609
you're acting really
weird right now.

1622
01:17:23,645 --> 01:17:24,487
I'm acting weird?

1623
01:17:24,492 --> 01:17:26,376
I think you're acting
weird right now.

1624
01:17:26,381 --> 01:17:28,681
Oh, I'm acting--
How exactly am I acting weird?

1625
01:17:28,783 --> 01:17:30,218
You've been trying to keep me...

1626
01:17:30,223 --> 01:17:31,614
from fucking
anybody but you...

1627
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:33,619
since we started this thing.

1628
01:17:34,222 --> 01:17:37,191
Maybe I was thinking
about your feelings.

1629
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:39,014
Were you thinking
of my feelings...

1630
01:17:39,019 --> 01:17:40,390
when you were banging Stacey?

1631
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:42,761
Because that'd be really sad
for Stacey.

1632
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,723
She told me that
you told her that...

1633
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:45,895
that was okay.

1634
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:51,031
I told her that it
was okay to ask you.

1635
01:17:52,874 --> 01:17:57,208
Holy shit. I get it.
I fucking get it.

1636
01:17:57,378 --> 01:17:58,997
It was a test. That
whole thing...

1637
01:17:59,002 --> 01:18:01,002
was a fucking
test, is that it?

1638
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:03,408
If it was, how do
you think you did?

1639
01:18:04,252 --> 01:18:05,648
We had a discussion, Miri.

1640
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:08,469
We had-- Actually, we had many...

1641
01:18:08,474 --> 01:18:11,888
discussions about how
it was just sex...

1642
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,049
- and how we wouldn't
let it get weird.

1643
01:18:14,054 --> 01:18:15,124
I'm not acting weird.

1644
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:17,154
You're acting like a
jealous girlfriend...

1645
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,062
is what the fuck
you're acting like.

1646
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:21,117
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.

1647
01:18:21,135 --> 01:18:22,998
You're not my boyfriend,
so why are...

1648
01:18:23,003 --> 01:18:25,003
we having this
conversation right now?

1649
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:27,431
Because you're about
to fuck Lester...

1650
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,305
to spite me, it seems like.

1651
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,676
Did you fuck Stacey
to spite me? No.

1652
01:18:31,846 --> 01:18:32,602
You fucked her...

1653
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:34,210
like you fucked
every other bitch...

1654
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:36,308
and never gave a shit
how I felt about it.

1655
01:18:36,818 --> 01:18:39,082
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?

1656
01:18:39,253 --> 01:18:41,475
Look, don't fucking
pretend that the...

1657
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,587
other night, you
and me, right there,

1658
01:18:43,758 --> 01:18:45,656
that that didn't mean
anything to you,

1659
01:18:45,661 --> 01:18:47,056
that you didn't feel it too.

1660
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:49,585
Oh. You're not
getting all gooey...

1661
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:51,590
on me here, are you, Zack?

1662
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:53,396
You know what?

1663
01:18:53,401 --> 01:18:54,757
If you were any other bitch

1664
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:56,532
I didn't give a
rat's ass about.

1665
01:18:56,537 --> 01:18:57,378
I would tell you...

1666
01:18:57,383 --> 01:18:58,801
to go fuck yourself
right now...

1667
01:18:58,806 --> 01:19:02,264
because I fucking hate
this game-playing shit.

1668
01:19:02,443 --> 01:19:04,443
But you,
you mean more to me than that,

1669
01:19:04,612 --> 01:19:07,012
so I'm just gonna lay this out
on front street.

1670
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:08,679
I know you felt something big,

1671
01:19:08,684 --> 01:19:10,480
something real
the other night...

1672
01:19:10,485 --> 01:19:13,215
when we were together
because I felt it too.

1673
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:18,086
We tried to fuck and instead,
we wound up making love.

1674
01:19:18,259 --> 01:19:20,193
So if this is what
you need to hear in...

1675
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:21,991
order to keep you
from fucking Lester,

1676
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:25,005
if this is what you
need, then fine.

1677
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,434
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.

1678
01:19:28,169 --> 01:19:30,169
I love you, Miri.

1679
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,208
Happy?

1680
01:19:36,477 --> 01:19:37,907
Oh, Jesus.

1681
01:19:37,912 --> 01:19:39,860
You better get ahold
of yourself, Zack,

1682
01:19:39,865 --> 01:19:41,865
because we just fucked.

1683
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:44,583
Okay.

1684
01:19:50,892 --> 01:19:53,190
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?

1685
01:19:54,162 --> 01:19:55,958
But you did.

1686
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:59,831
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.

1687
01:20:00,735 --> 01:20:02,735
Wait--

1688
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:09,368
All right, don't
forget I'm down here.

1689
01:20:09,373 --> 01:20:11,007
Watch that pullout, huh?

1690
01:20:11,012 --> 01:20:12,942
Yeah.

1691
01:20:12,947 --> 01:20:16,747
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.

1692
01:20:16,918 --> 01:20:17,854
- Where you going?

1693
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:19,382
Getting the fuck out of here.

1694
01:20:19,387 --> 01:20:21,387
We gotta finish this movie.

1695
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:28,994
Yo.

1696
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,999
You believe this shit?

1697
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:35,631
Do you believe this shit?

1698
01:20:35,636 --> 01:20:37,500
What the fuck just happened
in there?

1699
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:39,555
I'll tell you what
just happened in there.

1700
01:20:39,674 --> 01:20:42,336
That chick frosted me
like I was a fucking cake.

1701
01:21:00,428 --> 01:21:02,428
Zack.

1702
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,446
Okay, seriously,
get a picture of me right now.

1703
01:21:22,016 --> 01:21:24,109
I'm hunting humans.

1704
01:21:24,285 --> 01:21:27,277
- Dude, check it out. Ooh.
- Oh, shit.

1705
01:21:27,455 --> 01:21:27,953
Seriously,

1706
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,919
let's shoot the shit
out of this bitch.

1707
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:32,654
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?

1708
01:21:32,827 --> 01:21:34,827
Cock shots.

1709
01:21:48,276 --> 01:21:50,608
We shot you in the
balls, cunt nugget.

1710
01:21:51,112 --> 01:21:52,753
Well, it's my job to get shot...

1711
01:21:52,758 --> 01:21:54,758
in the balls, so--
Oh, they're gone.

1712
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:55,978
Excuse me.

1713
01:21:55,983 --> 01:21:57,358
Didn't you used to work at...

1714
01:21:57,363 --> 01:21:59,363
the Bean-N-Gone
in Monroeville?

1715
01:21:59,587 --> 01:22:02,780
I sure as shit hope
this pays better.

1716
01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:04,785
I tell you.

1717
01:22:07,495 --> 01:22:09,373
So why don't they
just shoot you...

1718
01:22:09,378 --> 01:22:10,192
with a puck?

1719
01:22:10,197 --> 01:22:11,394
What do you mean?

1720
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:15,130
I mean, what does paintball
got to do with hockey?

1721
01:22:15,937 --> 01:22:17,767
Nothing, I guess.

1722
01:22:17,772 --> 01:22:20,400
- So ain't no prizes or--?
- No, no.

1723
01:22:20,574 --> 01:22:22,574
So, what are they
paying $5 for?

1724
01:22:22,677 --> 01:22:25,805
To shoot a Broad Street Bully
in the balls.

1725
01:22:27,381 --> 01:22:29,381
White people are fucked up.

1726
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:31,614
Yup, they sure are.

1727
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:33,353
It's a living. You've
been getting...

1728
01:22:33,358 --> 01:22:34,717
the checks I've been sending?

1729
01:22:34,722 --> 01:22:36,872
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

1730
01:22:37,558 --> 01:22:39,558
Probably didn't
save you from a...

1731
01:22:39,561 --> 01:22:41,618
brutal tongue-lashing,
though, huh?

1732
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:43,129
You know, the wife...

1733
01:22:43,134 --> 01:22:45,231
never found out
about the camera,

1734
01:22:45,398 --> 01:22:47,295
because I paid off the bills.

1735
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,300
How did you manage that?

1736
01:22:49,336 --> 01:22:53,102
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.

1737
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:55,073
- The post office
fucking settled?

1738
01:22:55,078 --> 01:22:56,571
Hundred-sixty large, son.

1739
01:22:56,576 --> 01:22:58,303
- Nice, man. Congratulations.

1740
01:22:58,308 --> 01:23:00,512
A beautiful day,
thank you very much.

1741
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,644
I thought
you made that whole thing up.

1742
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:04,045
No, no. It was very real.

1743
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:06,050
You can believe it.

1744
01:23:06,386 --> 01:23:08,752
Even though she's
spending all of it.

1745
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,580
Well, since you
ain't gonna ask me.

1746
01:23:15,585 --> 01:23:17,158
I'll just go ahead
and tell you.

1747
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:20,860
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.

1748
01:23:21,034 --> 01:23:22,848
Oh, I suppose you
weren't gonna ask...

1749
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:24,265
about your movie, neither?

1750
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:25,943
Look, that's why
I came down here.

1751
01:23:25,948 --> 01:23:27,769
I need you to come
take a look at it.

1752
01:23:27,774 --> 01:23:29,154
- I'm not interested. Sorry.

1753
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:30,638
You'd better get interested...

1754
01:23:30,643 --> 01:23:32,345
- because you
still owe me money.

1755
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:33,842
What's wrong with the movie?

1756
01:23:33,847 --> 01:23:36,714
The story doesn't make sense.

1757
01:23:36,883 --> 01:23:37,640
- The story?

1758
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:39,645
The story doesn't make sense.

1759
01:23:39,652 --> 01:23:41,580
It's a fucking
porno movie, man.

1760
01:23:41,585 --> 01:23:42,417
What story?

1761
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:43,505
It's a movie, dog,

1762
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,619
and a movie's gotta
have an ending,

1763
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,555
which we don't have
at the moment.

1764
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,427
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.

1765
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:52,494
Do me this favor, okay?

1766
01:23:52,499 --> 01:23:55,161
When you're done
getting your nuts blown off,

1767
01:23:55,335 --> 01:23:57,847
come back to humble
Monroeville...

1768
01:23:57,852 --> 01:24:00,068
to my crib for a couple hours,

1769
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,698
check out the flick,
you tell me what's missing.

1770
01:24:04,677 --> 01:24:06,041
No.

1771
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:07,817
I'll tell you
what, you do that,

1772
01:24:07,822 --> 01:24:09,644
you don't owe me shit no more.

1773
01:24:09,649 --> 01:24:11,810
- Really?
- Really.

1774
01:24:11,985 --> 01:24:14,215
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.

1775
01:24:15,288 --> 01:24:17,776
- Maybe I should
leave the pads on.

1776
01:24:17,781 --> 01:24:19,781
You got some extra ones?

1777
01:24:32,005 --> 01:24:33,234
Hey, honey.

1778
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:34,437
Where the fuck you been?

1779
01:24:34,442 --> 01:24:36,337
And who in the
fuck is this now?

1780
01:24:36,342 --> 01:24:38,139
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.

1781
01:24:38,144 --> 01:24:40,744
You already left one white boy
down in my basement...

1782
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,483
while you off
gallivanting and shit.

1783
01:24:42,488 --> 01:24:43,812
What if this motherfucker...

1784
01:24:43,817 --> 01:24:45,234
- was all grabby on me?

1785
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:47,239
Ain't nobody
wanna grab on you.

1786
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,187
Oh, what in the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1787
01:24:50,356 --> 01:24:52,195
- Ain't nobody
wanna grab on you.

1788
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,588
White boys love me.

1789
01:24:53,593 --> 01:24:55,593
White boy.

1790
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:58,154
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?

1791
01:24:58,331 --> 01:25:00,331
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?

1792
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:02,197
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.

1793
01:25:02,202 --> 01:25:04,202
Yeah.

1794
01:25:07,006 --> 01:25:09,232
- Why don't you,
uh, head downstairs?

1795
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,405
Oh, okay.

1796
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,073
It's just through
this hallway.

1797
01:25:12,078 --> 01:25:14,103
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1798
01:25:16,716 --> 01:25:18,346
What the fuck you looking at?

1799
01:25:18,351 --> 01:25:21,051
Why you gotta be yelling at me
in front of my director?

1800
01:25:21,054 --> 01:25:22,550
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.

1801
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:24,605
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.

1802
01:25:24,724 --> 01:25:26,860
Well, why don't he
direct my ass to a...

1803
01:25:26,865 --> 01:25:28,790
new husband? How
about that shit?

1804
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:31,345
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.

1805
01:25:31,364 --> 01:25:33,464
Oh, don't nobody
want them saggy-ass balls.

1806
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,955
Saggy balls? Look at these...

1807
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,831
sagging-ass titties
you got around here.

1808
01:25:36,836 --> 01:25:38,441
- You could tie
these together.

1809
01:25:38,446 --> 01:25:40,446
Motherfucker, we match.

1810
01:25:43,076 --> 01:25:45,076
Oh, shit.

1811
01:25:45,678 --> 01:25:47,678
Where's my paintball gun at?

1812
01:25:47,847 --> 01:25:49,178
Look at you, editor and DP.

1813
01:25:49,183 --> 01:25:50,712
You got your shit
covered, man.

1814
01:25:50,717 --> 01:25:53,808
Please, don't ever
say 'shit-covered'...

1815
01:25:53,813 --> 01:25:55,813
to me again.

1816
01:25:56,256 --> 01:25:58,286
Roll the film for
the man, please,

1817
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:00,188
so we can see what he thinks.

1818
01:26:00,193 --> 01:26:01,724
Just jump through it. I ain't...

1819
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:03,729
got all night. The
bitch is on me.

1820
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:07,564
'Nigga Rich
Productions.' Classy.

1821
01:26:07,734 --> 01:26:10,202
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?

1822
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,313
Plus, it sounds like
an underground...

1823
01:26:12,318 --> 01:26:13,201
gay fuck club.

1824
01:26:13,206 --> 01:26:15,069
'I met a guy at
DreamWorks.' Yeah.

1825
01:26:15,074 --> 01:26:19,477
All right, so we got
Lester and Stacey fucking.

1826
01:26:19,646 --> 01:26:21,646
Then we got
Barry and Bubbles fucking.

1827
01:26:22,782 --> 01:26:25,046
And then this boring bullshit.

1828
01:26:30,123 --> 01:26:32,519
Okay, just, uh, go
to the next scene,

1829
01:26:32,524 --> 01:26:34,524
would you?

1830
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:36,090
Uh...

1831
01:26:36,095 --> 01:26:37,304
- What next scene?

1832
01:26:37,309 --> 01:26:39,309
The one with Miri and Lester?

1833
01:26:39,432 --> 01:26:41,432
We never shot it.

1834
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:42,559
- Why not?

1835
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:44,564
Because after you
left that night.

1836
01:26:44,637 --> 01:26:47,572
Miri came out of the backroom
and said she couldn't do it.

1837
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:51,733
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped? So...

1838
01:26:53,112 --> 01:26:56,138
- Wait, so Miri--
- Never fucked nobody.

1839
01:26:56,316 --> 01:26:58,316
Just you.

1840
01:26:58,985 --> 01:27:02,682
Now, I wonder
why she did that.

1841
01:27:02,855 --> 01:27:05,119
- Hm.
- Hm.

1842
01:27:06,326 --> 01:27:08,571
You see, there was
a time when I was...

1843
01:27:08,576 --> 01:27:10,763
just a bitter old
fuck making coffees,

1844
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:12,930
and Stacey was just
a lap dancer...

1845
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:15,230
and Barry and Bubbles
didn't know each other...

1846
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:16,372
and this fool here,

1847
01:27:16,377 --> 01:27:18,534
hell, I don't even
know what he was.

1848
01:27:18,705 --> 01:27:21,765
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.

1849
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:23,941
Then two people come along...

1850
01:27:23,943 --> 01:27:27,140
and showed us something
we didn't know existed.

1851
01:27:27,313 --> 01:27:29,385
A world of possibilities...

1852
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:32,307
where plain old people
just like us...

1853
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:34,749
could do something special.

1854
01:27:34,921 --> 01:27:37,059
Even if it's
something as simple...

1855
01:27:37,064 --> 01:27:39,064
as filming people fucking.

1856
01:27:49,502 --> 01:27:52,801
Sometimes we just
need someone...

1857
01:27:52,972 --> 01:27:56,965
to show us something
we can't see for ourselves...

1858
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:02,012
and then we're
changed forever.

1859
01:28:13,226 --> 01:28:16,491
So as you can see,
our movie ain't got no ending.

1860
01:28:18,064 --> 01:28:20,123
Every movie needs an ending,
don't it?

1861
01:28:24,837 --> 01:28:26,837
Peace.

1862
01:28:28,374 --> 01:28:29,374
Delaney,

1863
01:28:29,379 --> 01:28:32,140
you're a slick
cupid motherfucker.

1864
01:28:32,578 --> 01:28:34,578
Ain't love grand?

1865
01:28:34,647 --> 01:28:36,220
Why the fuck is this white boy...

1866
01:28:36,225 --> 01:28:38,225
running through
my goddamn house?

1867
01:28:39,052 --> 01:28:41,052
Sometimes.

1868
01:28:53,733 --> 01:28:55,733
Miri.

1869
01:28:56,069 --> 01:28:58,503
- Miri.
- Zack?

1870
01:28:59,672 --> 01:29:01,269
- Miri. I'm sorry.
- Get out.

1871
01:29:01,274 --> 01:29:02,970
- Close the door.
- It was closed.

1872
01:29:02,975 --> 01:29:04,228
- It was closed over--

1873
01:29:04,233 --> 01:29:06,233
Just close the
fucking door, Zack.

1874
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:09,319
I never slept with
Stacey that night,

1875
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:11,179
okay? I swear to God.

1876
01:29:11,184 --> 01:29:13,484
When we got into my room,
you know what we did?

1877
01:29:13,486 --> 01:29:15,691
We talked about you, and us...

1878
01:29:15,696 --> 01:29:18,048
and how things
were different...

1879
01:29:18,224 --> 01:29:21,216
and how I was
too much of a fucking pussy...

1880
01:29:21,394 --> 01:29:23,954
to just tell you how
I felt about you.

1881
01:29:24,697 --> 01:29:26,824
And I know-- I know
that that's only...

1882
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:29,066
because of all the
stupid shit we said...

1883
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:31,691
about how we wouldn't let sex...

1884
01:29:31,696 --> 01:29:34,537
change us, but it
did. It changed me.

1885
01:29:35,308 --> 01:29:37,776
That has to be love, right?

1886
01:29:38,077 --> 01:29:40,375
It has to be love...

1887
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,218
and just so you know,
I can't go back...

1888
01:29:43,223 --> 01:29:45,223
to being just friends anymore,

1889
01:29:46,352 --> 01:29:48,316
- because I just can't.
- Good.

1890
01:29:48,321 --> 01:29:50,321
And I think--

1891
01:29:51,624 --> 01:29:53,624
I think that you
feel the same way.

1892
01:29:54,093 --> 01:29:56,963
Because that night
after I left,

1893
01:29:56,968 --> 01:29:59,030
you didn't fuck Lester.

1894
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:04,502
What's up, Zack?

1895
01:30:14,747 --> 01:30:15,943
You know what?

1896
01:30:15,948 --> 01:30:17,546
I don't care that
you're fucking

1897
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:18,813
Lester, okay? How's that?

1898
01:30:18,818 --> 01:30:19,818
- Oh, shit.

1899
01:30:19,823 --> 01:30:21,682
I don't wanna be
with anyone but you.

1900
01:30:21,687 --> 01:30:24,186
So I will wait
forever for you, okay?

1901
01:30:24,191 --> 01:30:26,488
I will wait the
rest of my life...

1902
01:30:26,659 --> 01:30:29,958
because I love you, and I have
for as long as I can remember.

1903
01:30:30,596 --> 01:30:31,963
And I would rather die...

1904
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:33,968
than be without
you, Miriam Linky.

1905
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Miri's last name is Linky?

1906
01:30:36,469 --> 01:30:37,691
You're gonna fuck a guy...

1907
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,200
who doesn't know
your last name?

1908
01:30:39,205 --> 01:30:40,718
Or that you beat up Carl Roth...

1909
01:30:40,723 --> 01:30:42,236
in the sixth grade?
I know that.

1910
01:30:42,241 --> 01:30:43,726
Or what your senior prom dress...

1911
01:30:43,731 --> 01:30:45,306
would've looked
like had we gone...

1912
01:30:45,311 --> 01:30:46,513
but we decided not to,

1913
01:30:46,518 --> 01:30:48,376
and we got drunk
alone instead.

1914
01:30:48,381 --> 01:30:50,481
Or that you washed your hair
in the toilet.

1915
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:51,879
We're not fucking, Zack.

1916
01:30:51,884 --> 01:30:53,618
Or that you're
not fucking Zack--

1917
01:30:53,623 --> 01:30:53,981
What?

1918
01:30:53,986 --> 01:30:56,086
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.

1919
01:30:56,222 --> 01:30:58,225
I even tried to talk
her into giving me...

1920
01:30:58,230 --> 01:30:59,420
the fucking Dutch rudder.

1921
01:30:59,425 --> 01:31:01,425
Shot me down on that too.

1922
01:31:02,228 --> 01:31:03,485
- And a Dutch rudder is?

1923
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:05,393
Don't know what
a Dutch rudder--?

1924
01:31:05,398 --> 01:31:07,094
All right, you grab your dick,

1925
01:31:07,099 --> 01:31:09,124
then you have someone else
work your arm.

1926
01:31:09,302 --> 01:31:10,731
Here, let me show you.

1927
01:31:10,736 --> 01:31:12,582
All right, grab my
arm. I'm grabbing...

1928
01:31:12,587 --> 01:31:14,101
my dick, you're
grabbing my arm.

1929
01:31:14,106 --> 01:31:15,407
Now work it. Work my arm.

1930
01:31:15,412 --> 01:31:17,405
See that shit? Work
it up and down.

1931
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:19,469
It's like someone else
is jerking you off.

1932
01:31:19,645 --> 01:31:20,842
Okay.

1933
01:31:20,847 --> 01:31:22,643
There's the double
Dutch rudder,

1934
01:31:22,648 --> 01:31:24,946
which, I grab my dick,
you grab your dick,

1935
01:31:25,117 --> 01:31:27,079
you work my arm,
I work your arm,

1936
01:31:27,084 --> 01:31:27,849
same time.

1937
01:31:27,854 --> 01:31:30,220
It's like jerking off together
but not gay.

1938
01:31:30,389 --> 01:31:32,939
We're not touching dicks,
each other's dicks anyway.

1939
01:31:33,059 --> 01:31:34,307
I'm touching my own dick.

1940
01:31:34,312 --> 01:31:36,157
You're working it,
and I'm loving it.

1941
01:31:36,162 --> 01:31:39,063
It feels good, sir.
Try me, come on.

1942
01:31:39,232 --> 01:31:40,821
Sorry to change
the subject on you.

1943
01:31:40,826 --> 01:31:41,996
Lester,

1944
01:31:42,001 --> 01:31:44,832
but if you're
not fucking Miri,

1945
01:31:44,837 --> 01:31:47,667
why is your dick
out right now?

1946
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,866
Because I live here now,
and I like to be naked.

1947
01:31:51,477 --> 01:31:53,140
- What?
- When you moved out,

1948
01:31:53,145 --> 01:31:54,963
she couldn't afford
to pay her rent...

1949
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:56,911
by herself, so I
moved in to help.

1950
01:31:56,916 --> 01:31:58,916
But you just came
out of her room.

1951
01:31:58,951 --> 01:32:01,251
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.

1952
01:32:01,287 --> 01:32:03,949
Wait, wait, wait.
She changed rooms?

1953
01:32:04,123 --> 01:32:06,043
Yeah, she said she
did it because she...

1954
01:32:06,048 --> 01:32:08,048
missed the smell of
you or some shit.

1955
01:32:10,129 --> 01:32:12,059
I don't smell anything.

1956
01:32:12,064 --> 01:32:13,066
But you know what?

1957
01:32:13,071 --> 01:32:15,071
That probably means
she loves you.

1958
01:32:16,836 --> 01:32:19,862
- Night, Zack.
- Night.

1959
01:32:24,143 --> 01:32:26,143
Do you?

1960
01:32:28,214 --> 01:32:30,214
Then why are you crying?

1961
01:32:30,249 --> 01:32:32,717
Because I missed you so much.

1962
01:32:33,486 --> 01:32:35,486
Me too.

1963
01:32:36,422 --> 01:32:38,447
I love you.

1964
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:44,492
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.

1965
01:32:44,497 --> 01:32:46,193
I don't mean to alarm you...

1966
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:48,047
but I think I just
jerked off Lester...

1967
01:32:48,052 --> 01:32:49,764
a little bit.

1968
01:32:49,769 --> 01:32:52,219
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?

1969
01:32:52,271 --> 01:32:53,676
If you ask me nicely, I will

1970
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:55,681
Dutch-rudder you the
rest of our lives.

1971
01:32:55,808 --> 01:32:59,175
Good. I'm getting tired
of fucking the Fleshlight.

1972
01:32:59,345 --> 01:33:00,908
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.

1973
01:33:00,913 --> 01:33:03,438
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.

1974
01:33:04,016 --> 01:33:07,975
- Wrong room.
- Oh, God. That's gross.

1975
01:33:09,221 --> 01:33:11,849
Let us fuck.

1976
01:36:11,536 --> 01:36:12,536
Hello.

1977
01:36:12,541 --> 01:36:14,200
Welcome to Nigga
Rich Productions,

1978
01:36:14,205 --> 01:36:17,106
home of
Zack and Miri Make Your Porno,

1979
01:36:17,275 --> 01:36:19,172
the production house
for the couple...

1980
01:36:19,177 --> 01:36:21,805
looking to put a little spice
in their sex life.

1981
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:25,438
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard. Oh, God.

1982
01:36:25,617 --> 01:36:27,771
First, you'll meet
for a consultation...

1983
01:36:27,776 --> 01:36:29,716
with one of our
romance-ologists,

1984
01:36:29,721 --> 01:36:30,618
who'll coach you...

1985
01:36:30,623 --> 01:36:32,418
through that initial
awkward stage...

1986
01:36:32,423 --> 01:36:34,120
before you're camera-ready.

1987
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:35,918
So we will start off...

1988
01:36:35,923 --> 01:36:38,653
with some erotic
massage and some--

1989
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:41,799
Dude. Some light petting.

1990
01:36:41,966 --> 01:36:43,663
That sounds good.

1991
01:36:43,668 --> 01:36:45,903
Are you guys sure
you don't wanna do...

1992
01:36:45,908 --> 01:36:47,734
some, uh, butt-sack work too?

1993
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:49,800
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?

1994
01:36:49,974 --> 01:36:52,324
From their break-out hit,
Swallow My Cockuccino,

1995
01:36:52,443 --> 01:36:55,041
to the multi-million selling
Swallow My Cockuccino II...

1996
01:36:55,046 --> 01:36:57,139
and the award-winning
Star Whores saga,

1997
01:36:57,315 --> 01:37:00,284
including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.

1998
01:37:00,451 --> 01:37:02,448
Zack and Miri have proven
time and again...

1999
01:37:02,453 --> 01:37:05,183
that they know
how to shoot hot sex.

2000
01:37:06,157 --> 01:37:09,550
As an actor, I've
sometimes brought...

2001
01:37:09,555 --> 01:37:12,858
my work home with
me inappropriately.

2002
01:37:13,031 --> 01:37:16,318
When you're telling
your real-life lover...

2003
01:37:16,323 --> 01:37:17,630
in the bedroom,

2004
01:37:17,635 --> 01:37:18,857
to, you know, bend over...

2005
01:37:18,862 --> 01:37:20,366
while you cake
your hand in K-Y,

2006
01:37:20,371 --> 01:37:21,857
it is a sign that
the romance is dead.

2007
01:37:21,862 --> 01:37:23,036
I think.

2008
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:24,907
Then we turned to
the professionals...

2009
01:37:24,912 --> 01:37:26,706
at Zack and Miri
Make Your Porno.

2010
01:37:26,711 --> 01:37:27,711
Oh, my God,

2011
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:29,839
they totally saved
our civil union.

2012
01:37:30,014 --> 01:37:32,448
They filmed what
was inside of us...

2013
01:37:32,617 --> 01:37:34,560
and not what was
coming out of us...

2014
01:37:34,565 --> 01:37:35,381
necessarily.

2015
01:37:35,386 --> 01:37:37,786
It helped me see
his asshole...

2016
01:37:37,956 --> 01:37:42,689
as not just a come dumpster,

2017
01:37:42,861 --> 01:37:46,297
but a sign of his
beauty, his flower.

2018
01:37:46,464 --> 01:37:50,161
It became a, uh,
gorgeous orchid.

2019
01:37:50,335 --> 01:37:51,557
Orchids grow...

2020
01:37:51,562 --> 01:37:54,499
in sort of the
filthiest conditions.

2021
01:37:54,672 --> 01:37:58,108
That's what his
asshole became to me.

2022
01:37:58,113 --> 01:38:01,271
This beautiful
flower amidst shit.

2023
01:38:01,446 --> 01:38:03,041
- Honey, they
get the metaphor.

2024
01:38:03,046 --> 01:38:04,177
I don't think they do.

2025
01:38:04,182 --> 01:38:06,946
Let's just say,
thank you to Zack and Miri.

2026
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:09,712
It's helped us out,
it's helped our friends.

2027
01:38:09,888 --> 01:38:12,049
Enrique? Park?

2028
01:38:12,223 --> 01:38:15,283
Park? Enrique?

2029
01:38:15,526 --> 01:38:18,825
Can we get a little love
for Zack and Miri?

2030
01:38:19,998 --> 01:38:22,289
They don't even know
what's going on,

2031
01:38:22,294 --> 01:38:24,230
they're so pilled up.

2032
01:38:24,235 --> 01:38:26,411
But don't take
his word for it.

2033
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:28,416
Just ask our co-founders.

2034
01:38:28,907 --> 01:38:32,070
- Hi. I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.

2035
01:38:32,243 --> 01:38:33,316
Here at Zack and Miri

2036
01:38:33,321 --> 01:38:35,275
Make Your Porno,
we're dedicated...

2037
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,280
- to committing your love--
- Or lust.

2038
01:38:37,448 --> 01:38:39,537
- -to high-end,
quality production...

2039
01:38:39,542 --> 01:38:40,713
digital video.

2040
01:38:40,718 --> 01:38:42,777
A forever keepsake
of your passion.

2041
01:38:42,954 --> 01:38:44,914
That's right, Miri.
Why set up a camera...

2042
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:46,085
at the end of your bed...

2043
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:48,752
and settle for one
unflattering angle,

2044
01:38:48,927 --> 01:38:50,747
when you could let
the professionals...

2045
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,292
dazzle and delight
your senses...

2046
01:38:52,297 --> 01:38:55,061
with an array of shots
so masterfully rendered...

2047
01:38:55,233 --> 01:38:55,831
you'll swear

2048
01:38:55,836 --> 01:38:57,797
Martin Scorsese snuck
into your room...

2049
01:38:57,802 --> 01:38:59,666
and caught you fucking?

2050
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:00,319
And remember,

2051
01:39:00,324 --> 01:39:02,068
we're not just
the presidents...

2052
01:39:02,073 --> 01:39:04,200
of Zack and Miri
Make Your Porno.

2053
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:06,809
We're also clients.

2054
01:39:08,212 --> 01:39:10,212
Call now to set up
your appointment...

2055
01:39:10,214 --> 01:39:15,345
or find us on the web
at www.ZackandMiri. com.

2056
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:28,648
Way to fuck, Zack.
