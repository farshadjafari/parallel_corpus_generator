Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,142
Never let it fade away

For love may come
and tap you on the shoulder

7
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,994
Some starless night

8
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,636
just in case you feel
you wanna hold her

9
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,640
You'll have a pocketful of starlight

And just in case you feel
you wanna hold her

17
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:54,946
- You'll have a pocketful of starlight
-Pocketful of starlight

18
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,809
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

19
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,488

Save it for a rainy day

22
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,133
For when your troubles
start multiplying

23
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,535
And they just might

24
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,611
It's easy to forget them
without trying

25
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,315
With just a pocketful of starlight

26
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,255

Save it for a rainy day

30
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,808
You keeping busy?

31
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,110
Yeah, I've been busy.
You know.

32
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,179
- Busy doing what?
-Busy in the garden.

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,781
In the garden. You know what?
You're missing work. That's what.

34
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,349
-I can see that.
-No, I'm not missing work.

35
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,377
Yeah, you're missing the buzz and
the jokes and the guys. I know that.

36
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,789
-Don't tell me that's not true. Yeah.
-Maybe a Iittle.

37
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,457
Are you gonna buy some meat
or what?

38
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,693
Yeah, I'm gonna buy some meat.
I'm Iooking at some meat right now.

39
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,896
-I want to get some real good steak.
-I got a special here on the rump.

40
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,231
oh, forget the specials.

41
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,467
I got the children visiting me
this weekend from all over the country.

42
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,058
Got them all around the same table,
all four of them.

43
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:29,808
Clean up aisle five.

44
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,189
Clean up aisle five, please.

45
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,479
Excuse me.
Do you know about these wines?

46
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,985
-The wine? These wines?
-Yeah.

47
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,885
I stock this section.
Why? Is there a problem?

48
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,819
No, I just wanna get some expensive
bottles of wine for my children.

49
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,456
-This isn't for children.
-I know it's not for children.

50
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,299
It's for my children
that aren't children anymore.

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,758
What would be the best one...
ones of this?

52
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,307
Well, we got wines
from all over the world.

53
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,743
We got English wines,
you know, from France.

54
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,612
We got Italian wines
from all over Europe.

55
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,613
I wanna make a good impression
on my kids.

56
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,883
You will. Definitely.

57
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:16,755
It's got a built-in
tenderizing gauge

58
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,406
for steaks and poultry
with seven different grades.

59
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,353
And there's an automatic spritz
to calm flames if the oil catches.

60
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:26,465
It is guaranteed for five years
with a premium protective seal.

61
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,195
It has an automatic rotisserie,

62
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,362
and when the Iid is closed,
the oxygen's reduced to a Ievel

63
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,134
that does not support
or encourage the fats to ignite.

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,566
Yeah.

65
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,044
-Is that what it's going for?
-648. That's the sale price.

66
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,913
That's a heck of a deal for this model.
That's as Iow as I can go.

67
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,451
-How about 6?
-Done. Sure. Absolutely.

68
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,149
-Where do I...
-You can just put it right in there.

69
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,060
-Looks Iike somebody's having a party.
-Yeah, it's just the family.

70
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,818
-Hello?
-Dad, it's Robert.

71
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,902
Robert.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,270
Dad, listen,
things aren't looking very good...

73
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,085
-Sorry.
-oh, well, that's a shame.

74
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,030
That's a real shame.

75
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,127
Yeah, you're gonna miss out
on having some fancy wine

76
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,734
-and filet mignon steak and...
-Have you heard from the others?

77
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,205
Yeah, so far all of them are coming.

78
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,472
Some Friday night,
some Saturday morning.

79
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,041
-I'm sorry again, Dad.
-Yeah, I'm sorry, too, Rob,

80
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,250
but you gotta get back
to that orchestra, Son.

81
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,119
-I will. You take care. Okay.
-okay. You take care, too. okay.

82
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,115
okay.

83
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,776
Dad, hi. I can't stop right now.
I'm back on stage in a few minutes.

84
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:27,149
The producers are flying in from Paris
and wanna see the original cast,

85
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,087
so I just can't get away this weekend.

86
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,356
I'm sorry. I know I haven't been home
since the funeral,

87
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,161
but I'm trying, I promise. I love you.
I'm thinking of you.

88
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,597
Big kiss.

89
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,994
Hey, Dad. It's Amy.

90
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:46,405
I'm really sorry to have to do this,

91
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,239
but things have just gotten really crazy
at the agency

92
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:53,075
and jack's sick with a fever.
He missed school today.

93
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,909
So between one thing and another,

94
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,438
we're not gonna be able to make it
this weekend.

95
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,383
I'm really sorry, Dad.

96
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,382
And to make things worse,

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,449
I spoke to David today,
and he can't make it, either.

98
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,484
He's got a lot going on,
a painting or something, but...

99
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,623
Anyway, I promise
we'll make it to you soon. Okay?

100
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,000
Love you.

101
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,464
Well, you can't.

102
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:31,283
You can't just go flying
all across the country,

103
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,174
-not in your condition.
-Who said anything about flying?

104
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,747
What about buses? What about trains?

105
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,323
I'm worried about your Iungs, Frank.

106
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,392
Don't worry about my Iungs.
Worry about your Iungs.

107
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,587
My Iungs are fine.

108
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,528
Fibrosis of the Iungs requires you
to take things easy.

109
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,656
Now, you know that.

110
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,599
I'm just going on the buses,
on the trains...

111
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,034
You picked the wrong job, Frank.
I mean,

112
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,003
breathing in humidified
all those years...

113
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,233
You know, it's just about seeing
the family. You know, I...

114
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,006
Jean always kept in touch
with everybody, and now it's...

115
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,509
You know how it is.
Now it's down to me.

116
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,250
-How are you managing on your own?
-I'm fine.

117
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,257
-You're fine? Yeah, fine?
-Fine, yeah. I'm fine.

118
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,953
You know, when I Iost my wife,

119
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,896
I found myself talking to her
Iike she was still there.

120
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,330
It went on for months.

121
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,464
"Where the hell are my shorts?"

122
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,136
No, no. There's nobody there.
No. Talking to myself.

123
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,069
Crazy, huh?

124
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,476
-You do that, Frank?
-No.

125
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,777
-No? No?
- Not yet.

126
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,283
Look, I hear what you're saying, I do,
but this trip,

127
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,912
it's not what you need right now.
You gotta take things easy.

128
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,285
You do. Stay home.

129
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,760
You know what you should do?
Spend more time in the garden.

130
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,125
Ed said it was fine.

131
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:03,265
He said just take enough medication
and stick to trains and buses.

132
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,541
And I' take plenty of pictures,
and I' bring home the news.

133
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,074
I' start with David in New York.

134
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,413
And if anything goes wrong,
I' be right home.

135
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,759
Got my keys, got my wallet.

136
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:29,700
My keys, got my medication.

137
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,368
Camera.

138
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,131
Got my keys.

139
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,801
Next.

140
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,963
New York City. one way, please.

141
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,437
-$87.
-$87. There's 1 00.

142
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,443
-I'm going to see my son.
-Very good.

143
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,878
-You know what he does?
-Absolutely no idea.

144
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,148
-He's an artist.
-Gate 7. Thank you.

145
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,620
-Next.
-Thank you.

146
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,007
Uh, what do you think of my work?

147
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,979
You've been Iooking at it
ever since we Ieft the station.

148
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

149
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:53,718
No, don't Iook at me.
Look back out the window.

150
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,084
Tell me what you see.

151
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,418
-Wo Cars?
-No.

152
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,684
-Trees?
-Well, yes, but no.

153
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,594
Houses?

154
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:07,599
Just remember that
you've been Iooking at it

155
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,094
-ever since we Ieft the station.
-oh, the window. The glass?

156
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,107
No. Not bad, but it's a start... But...

157
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,601
-Birds?
-Uh, no. Not birds.

158
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,544
-Rocks?
-Not rocks. No, that's ridiculous.

159
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,782
Rocks!. You're just guessing.

160
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:33,391
I'm gonna stick with this Iady here.
I think she has an idea.

161
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,326
No, honestly,
I really have no idea what you mean.

162
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,352
You know, just Iook for the rhythm.

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,958
-The telephone poles?
- ose. ose.

164
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,837
-The wire?
-Yeah. Keep going. Keep going.

165
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,467
-Really, I give up.
-No, no. okay. That's it. That's it.

166
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,589
The wire, that's good.

167
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,478
I mean, I didn't make the wire,
I didn't hang the wire,

168
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,812
but I coated the wire.
I protected it with  coating

169
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,182
against the rain, the moisture, heat,
stuff Iike that.

170
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,121
So, what you actually see
is not the wire. It's my  coating.

171
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,353
I ran 1,000 miles of wire a week,
non-stop.

172
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,861
-Wow.
-Non-stop.

173
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,029
If you just think for a minute,

174
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,329
all the conversations
that have taken place over that wire.

175
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,800
Breaking good news and bad news.

176
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,231
Yeah.

177
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,271
-I' show you something.
-Sure.

178
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,269
These are my children.

179
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,106
Robert, the conductor.

180
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,912
David, the artist. Rosie, the dancer.
Amy, very high up in advertising.

181
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,521
A million feet of wire
to get them where they are today.

182
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,623
-Wo It's a nice picture.
-Thank you.

183
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,995
Million feet of wire
to get them where they are today.

184
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,733
-Rocks?
-Yeah, right. That's right. Rocks.

185
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,937
They were all...
They were all supposed to visit me,

186
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,617
and we were gonna have
a family reunion,

187
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,746
and instead they all canceled on me
at the Iast minute.

188
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,011
Hoo You Iock yourself out, honey?

189
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,121
No, I didn't Iock myself out.

190
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,757
My son Iives here.
I'm just waiting for him.

191
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,934
You can come wait with me if you want.
I know a place.

192
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,703
oh, thank you.
That's nice of you, though.

193
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,194
-You sure?
-Thank you.

194
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,638
You wanna see my Ieg?

195
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,473
You wanna see mine?

196
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,428
1 : Come on.
2: Are we here?

197
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,730
1 : oh, man.

198
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,760
-Dude, I can't believe you, man.
-What?

199
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,539
I can't believe you, all night...

200
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,509
David.

201
00:15:55,428 --> 00:16:00,091
What are you gonna do
when you grow up? Huh?

202
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,926
I wanna be a painter
and do my pictures.

203
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,095
No, not a painter.
Christ, painters paint walls,

204
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,065
and dogs pee on walls.
You're gonna be an artist.

205
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,795
Artists paint pictures
that change people's lives.

206
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,436
So what are you gonna be?
An artist.

207
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,238
That's right, an artist.
So, you gonna work hard?

208
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,297
Yes, Dad.

209
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,111
You gonna make me proud?
I'm trying, Dad.

210
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:38,696
Unfortunately, it's going to be

211
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,995
on top of the coast sometime tomorrow.

212
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:45,732
Right now, Hurricane Alice is packing
winds of 1 65 miles per hour.

213
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,831
We've got
a Category 5 hurricane. The pressure...

214
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,364
Looks Iike a bad storm.

215
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,535
-Huh?
-A bad storm.

216
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,537
I'm 94.

217
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,049
-I keep away from the doctors.
-Boy.

218
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,184
I have three children, six grandchildren.

219
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,018
They're busy.

220
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,027
They're too busy to talk to me.
I gotta make an appointment.

221
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,795
They got Iost someplace.
They don't need anybody.

222
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,965
People changed, Iife is changed.

223
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:20,204
Today, you shake hands
with somebody,

224
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,039
you gotta count your fingers
to make sure you got five fingers back.

225
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,952
Wo Hi.
Hi.

226
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,127
Wo Can I help you?
Do the bells work?

227
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,390
Wo Yeah.

228
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,332
My son Iives in apartment 9.
I'm not sure if he's home.

229
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,584
Wo  right.
Thank you.

230
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,000
David?

231
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:26,193
Through my sleepless days
I found

232
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,523
That in my dreamless sleep I'm bound

233
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,429
To one night hear the sound

234
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,109
Of you calling

235
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,172
Do not stumble through tonight

236
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,874
Have no fear of falling

237
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,643
We won't stumble through tonight

238
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,853
Drowning in their laughter

239
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,194
Amy, it's Rosie.

240
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,128
-Dad's not answering his phone.
- Well, don't call him.

241
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,073
Not till we know what's going on
with David.

242
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,907
Is there any more news?
No.

243
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,505
I just had that one call from
Mexico saying he'd been arrested.

244
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,982
I keep leaving messages,
but no one's calling back.

245
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,603
I think we should tell Dad.

246
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,586
Not until we know
what's going on.

247
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,287
just avoid talking to him
for a couple of days

248
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,724
-till we know the facts, okay?
- Okay.

249
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,804
-oh, my God!
-Surprise.

250
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,970
Yeah, definitely. Come on in, Grandpa.

251
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,914
-Man, does Mom know?
-No, I hope not.

252
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,687
Well, hey, Iook at you.

253
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,422
I thought you were supposed to be
in bed with a fever.

254
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,491
-I don't know, am I?
-That's what she told me.

255
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,426
Yeah, I think I was...

256
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,555
-It's got a handle.
-of course it's got a handle.

257
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,895
-I didn't know that.
-It's got wheels.

258
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,397
-Yeah. Look how big you got.
-I know, right?

259
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,166
-Gee.
-Hey, Iisten. I'm online.

260
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,041
-I' be back in a minute.
- right. You do your thing.

261
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,679
-Mom's out back.
-okay, good.

262
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,749
No, I need to get down there. Yeah.

263
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,584
Can you check out some flights
and see what's available?

264
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,164
Amy!

265
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,502
Dad?

266
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,911
What are you doing here?

267
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,479
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

268
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,981
Everybody didn't show up for the visit.

269
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,076
So I said, "If you don't come to me,
I'm gonna go to you."

270
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,983
You crazy man.

271
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,255
Look at you. You haven't been well.
You shouldn't be traveling.

272
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,090
-Did you check with the doctor?
-I checked with the doctor.

273
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,426
-You checked with him?
-of course I checked with the doctor.

274
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,588
-Jeff home?
-No, not yet.

275
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,686
Let me find out
when he's coming back.

276
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,629
So everybody dropped out of the visit?
I didn't realize. I had no idea.

277
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,965
How did you get here?

278
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,343
-You didn't fly, did you?
-No, of course I didn't fly.

279
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,944
I took a train to New York to see David,

280
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,277
and he wasn't there
so I took a bus here.

281
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,343
-You took a bus? To Chicago?
-Yeah.  by myself.

282
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,981
-oh, my God. I can't believe it!
-Yeah. Jack got better fast.

283
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,987
Yeah, no, he did.
Definitely, it was a 24-hour thing.

284
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,619
oh. Hmm.

285
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,927
I Iike the house.

286
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,401
-Yeah? But you've seen pictures.
-I've seen pictures.

287
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,700
I haven't seen the house,
not the real thing.

288
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,901
-Hey, everyone.
- Hey, Jack.

289
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,269
-How's it going?
-Good.

290
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,871
Jack, why don't you take Grandpa
outside and show him your golf?

291
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,780
-You play golf?
-Sure, I'm a natural.

292
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:07,351
-Yeah, I'd Iike to see that.
-You wanna see that?

293
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,620
-Where are you hitting it?
- To that flag over there.

294
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:13,284
the way out there? oh, boy. okay.

295
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,425
-My record's three.
-Three?

296
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,826
I' believe that when I see it.
Come on, Iet's go.

297
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,332
-You watch.
-okay.

298
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,131
Whoa!

299
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,702
Not bad.

300
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,378
-Beat that.
-I' beat that, easily, but...

301
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,831
right.

302
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,783
Now I' just have to show you
a few things.

303
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:46,587
Yeah, that was good,
but not good enough. Frank, the pro.

304
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,951
-Come on, Tiger Woods.
-You ready?

305
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,162
- Take your time.
-okay, ready? Yeah.

306
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,301
-oh, shit! Sorry.
- What was that?

307
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,006
Shot that...

308
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,408
That was just a practice shot.
Give me another one of those.

309
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,036
I'm going after this.

310
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,209
Here we go.

311
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:17,245
-Ah! Shit! Christ! Sorry.
-oh. Whoa!

312
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,223
-You hit the spice garden.
-one more. Come on.

313
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,658
This is the Iast one. Come on. This is...

314
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,490
I'm your guest. one more. Let's go.

315
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,825
Come on. one more. one more.
Let's go.

316
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,263
-This is my Iast one.
-one more.

317
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,965
-Don't Iose this one, too.
-Give me another ball.

318
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,593
Put it down. Be a sport.

319
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,534
-I wanna watch this baby fly.
-Ready?

320
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,832
-Ready?
-Impress me.

321
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:42,138
oh, shit. Damn. Fucking Christ.
Sorry. Sorry.

322
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,379
Can you just...
Yes, Chinese food would be fine.

323
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,116
No, of course not.
No, he doesn't know anything.

324
00:24:51,117 --> 00:24:54,325
So, I hear you're doing
very well at school.

325
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,454
- Nah, not really.
-What do you mean "not really"?

326
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,260
Your mother says
you're at the top of your class.

327
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,027
-Does she?
-Yeah.

328
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,536
-You have to work hard at school.
-Yeah, I know.

329
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:12,643
I' tell you what I used to tell
your mother when she was your age.

330
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,976
About being the best
and getting to the top?

331
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,813
-That's right.
-Yeah, she warned me about that.

332
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,394
-Jeff's home.
- okay.

333
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,980
- Hey, Frank.
-Hi, Jeff.

334
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,277
What's all this? Come here, come here.

335
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,484
-Surprise.
-Big surprise. Big surprise.

336
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,491
-Look at you. You're Iooking so well.
-You, too.

337
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,651
It's good to see you.

338
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,125
oh, my God! What a day!

339
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,757
You don't wanna know.
I'm sorry I'm so Iate.

340
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,233
-Can you believe this?
-Can I believe it?

341
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,759
Well, nothing surprises me
about this guy.

342
00:26:12,897 --> 00:26:16,807
Well, the place
was really crowded today.

343
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,572
I can't believe
I was able to get out of there alive.

344
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,846
Don't just eat your rice.
Make sure you eat your chicken.

345
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,897
okay?

346
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,559
Let me get you a fork.

347
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,871
You don't know
how to use chopsticks?

348
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,499
Yeah, I can use them.

349
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,376
I can use them to beat you at golf,
that's how well I can use them.

350
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,378
-You Iike making fun of me, don't you?
-Yeah, you're funny.

351
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,540
-Yeah, I'm funny, huh?
-Try this.

352
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,014
Thanks. A fork. A regular fork.

353
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,884
Now I can eat without dropping this
all down my shirt.

354
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,198
Jack, can you pass Dad the chili sauce,
please?

355
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,120
Jack?

356
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:18,999
No.

357
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,338
-Jack, pass him the sauce.
-I'm not passing anything.

358
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,389
Don't be silly.

359
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,967
I don't really want it. It's fine.
I don't need it.

360
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,646
- You sure?
-Stop asking him.

361
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,812
He's not stupid.
If he says no, he means no.

362
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:34,351
If he changes his mind,
he knows where it is.

363
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,820
-He can get it himself.
-  Jack.

364
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,224
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-That's okay.

365
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,392
So, what are your plans?

366
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:58,035
Well, I thought that I would stay
a day or two or so,

367
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,739
and then head on out to see Robert.
Surprise him on his tour.

368
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:07,443
That would have been so great.
It's just, this week's really difficult.

369
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,820
I feel awful. I got this huge pitch
to oversee at the agency,

370
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,450
and Jeff's flying out
on business tomorrow.

371
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,223
We should arrange it properly,
another time.

372
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,522
Well, maybe I can just spend time
with Jack?

373
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,867
Yeah, that would have been great, too,
but he starts school again tomorrow,

374
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,033
and then he's off on a field trip
for three days.

375
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,511
-A field trip? Where are you going?
-I don't know.

376
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,604
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

377
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,009
Well, you know, Iook,

378
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,351
that's what happens
when you show up unexpectedly.

379
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,721
I understand. You're busy. That's fine.
Look...

380
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,728
oh, God, I feel awful.
Any other time but this week.

381
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,324
Listen, I've had a good time.
I've seen the house.

382
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,163
I've seen Jeff and you,

383
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,435
and I Iet this guy beat me at golf,
so all in all it's been a pretty good trip.

384
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,668
-I'm really sorry, Dad. Really.
-No.

385
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:06,810
I'm gonna call Robert tonight
and find out where he's gonna be at.

386
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,211
I just... He's really busy.

387
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:11,548
He's on tour, and I just don't know
if it's gonna be possible. What?

388
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,484
No, don't call him,
because I wanna surprise him.

389
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,569
oh.

390
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,746
-okay.
-Promise?

391
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,053
Yeah, promise. Absolutely. Yeah.

392
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:34,104
I'm putting Dad
on the train tomorrow.

393
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,672
He'll be with you in Denver
the next morning.

394
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,776
What? No, I'm rehearsing.
I haven't got time to meet him.

395
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,877
Well, he can't stay here!

396
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,246
I need to get on a flight to Mexico
to see what's going on with David.

397
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,947
Is he okay?
Have you spoken to him?

398
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,781
No, but I got through
to the police today.

399
00:29:46,782 --> 00:29:48,952
No surprise.
They said the arrest was drug related,

400
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,788
but they won't give me
any more details over the phone.

401
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,053
So I'm gonna try
and get on a flight tomorrow.

402
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:55,392
Amy, listen, I don't know
if I can lie to Dad

403
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,020
about David when he gets here.

404
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,894
Well, just make up an excuse
to get him to Rosie's.

405
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:03,628
Say you're flying off to Europe
for a concert or something.

406
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:05,569
That's too obvious.
I'm not gonna do that.

407
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,835
Well, think of something yourself!
Are you okay?

408
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,179
Jeff, come on!

409
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,161
Jeff, come on.
Dad's waiting to take a photo!

410
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,894
Just get it out,
and I' Iook at it when I get there.

411
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,062
- right. okay, bye.
- I' take one of you two first.

412
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,964
-okay.
- right. Here?

413
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,472
Little over this way.

414
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,139
okay. Little...

415
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,118
Together. Everybody together.
Together.

416
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,981
-Where's the...
-It's the silver button on top.

417
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,925
-oh, my God. This is film. This is great.
-Smile.

418
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,428
Watch your finger.
Your finger's on the edge.

419
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,456
Yep. okay! Give me a beautiful...
right.

420
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,166
You said Jack was
at the top of his class,

421
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,196
-but he says he's not doing that well.
-Well, he was at the top of his class.

422
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,368
He's struggling at the moment,
that's all.

423
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:23,614
I tell you the good news
and spare you the bad.

424
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,616
Isn't that what Mom used to do for you
when we were kids?

425
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,744
It doesn't matter what your mother did.

426
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:30,153
Tell me the bad news
as well as the good news from now on.

427
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,849
-Do you understand?
-Fine.

428
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,617
-You doing okay at home?
-Huh?

429
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:37,961
-You doing okay at home?
-Fine.

430
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,361
-You sure?
-Yeah.

431
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,896
Are you sure?

432
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,227
I didn't realize there was
so much to do around the house.

433
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,703
Mom would have Ioved
to hear you say that.

434
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,735
Yeah.

435
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,753
What was all that at dinner Iast night
with the chili sauce?

436
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:59,016
Jeff just doesn't Iet Jack
get his own way all the time, that's all.

437
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,279
They always fight.

438
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:05,756
I checked the train times.
There's one in a few hours.

439
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,089
I just gotta drop by the office first.

440
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,856
-Advertising?
-Advertising agency, yeah.

441
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,320
-Your agency?
-Part mine.

442
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,103
Amy. Wait, wait, wait.

443
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,966
To your Ieft a Iittle.
To your Ieft, to your Ieft.

444
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,717
-okay.
-one more. It's okay.

445
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,650
Just hold on.

446
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,352
-A Iittle to your Ieft. Left, Ieft, Ieft.
-I'm so sorry.

447
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,723
That's it.

448
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,390
-I got it. Yeah.
-You got it?

449
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:49,533
Yeah, no, that's a fish.
It Iooks great.

450
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,584
ToM: It Iooks good.

451
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:52,502
-I think it works perfectly...
-So remind me of the market.

452
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,802
ToM: Yep. It's home owners,
blue collar to middle class.

453
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,037
-Like my dad.
-Um, I guess, yeah. Sure.

454
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,307
I guess.
ToM: Just Iike your dad. Sure.

455
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:03,847
So, pitch it to him.
Let's see what he thinks.

456
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,679
Hey, Dad. Come over here.

457
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,810
-ToM: Right now? Sure.
-Yeah.

458
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,320
-Hey. Tom.
-Tom? Hi, Tom. Frank.

459
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,619
-Frank, I'm Steph.
-Steph?

460
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,387
-Hi, Dad. "Dad" 'cause of...
-Hi. Frank.

461
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,486
We got a  commercial.
They're gonna pitch it to you. okay?

462
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,393
-Um, To...
-Sit down.

463
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,026
-Sit here?
-Yeah.

464
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,031
-In your chair?
-Yeah.

465
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,700
-Now you're in charge.
-Nice chair.

466
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:31,470
okay, so it's an ad for ,
for a financial organization...

467
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,376
-Yeah, don't tell him. Just pitch it.
-I'm so sorry.

468
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,041
okay. So there's a guy by the Iake,
and he is fishing just Iike this.

469
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,046
Pine forests.
Snow-covered mountains.

470
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:44,755
And he's wearing a quilted jacket
'cause, you know... It's, Iike, really cold.

471
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,590
What do you do when it gets cold?
Put a quilted jacket on.

472
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,855
-He's a Iittle nippy.
-A couple Iayers.

473
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,889
okay, here we go.
Big fish jumps out of the water.

474
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,523
I'm talking a big mother
with big beady eyes.

475
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,261
-Kind of Iooks Iike... Right?
-Just Iike that.

476
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:59,536
Looks at the guy, right in the eyes,
and he says,

477
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,997
"Hey, brother, you Iooking for me?"
Voice over.

478
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,976
"Ever wonder why Iife wasn't this easy?

479
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:11,038
"At Crest and Landing, transferring
multiple Ioans to one company

480
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,277
-"can be this easy."
-ToM: okay.

481
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:15,585
We cut to a shot right here of this guy
by a campfire.

482
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,822
We see that big fish right above
some coals, right? ose-up of the fish.

483
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,053
Boom, right there! As he says,

484
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:25,150
"Hey, buddy, I'm done on this side.
Wanna turn me over?"

485
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,495
That's...

486
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,796
-You Iike it?
-Yeah, it's funny.

487
00:34:29,797 --> 00:34:31,535
It's funny.
The fish talking, it makes me Iaugh.

488
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,736
Yeah, it's funny. It's very funny.

489
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,864
Fish usually don't talk. That's why it's...

490
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,865
The fish with the face and the voice.
It Iooks Iike a fish. You Iook Iike a fish.

491
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:42,379
oh, my God, I just said that to him
yesterday. That he Iooked Iike...

492
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,245
His mom Iooks Iike a flounder.

493
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,547
-What was it for?
-What, the fish?

494
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,682
-No, the spot. What was it selling?
-Yeah, the Ioans.

495
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,850
That...

496
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,489
It's... Transferring the Ioans
to another company,

497
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,361
it's as easy as getting
the fish out of the water.

498
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,887
Good. So, does the client Iike it?

499
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:03,733
-Likes it, but doesn't wanna go with it.
- Why not?

500
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:08,262
They feel uncomfortable about saying
that it's easy to transfer your debt.

501
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,831
-Because...
-Because it's not.

502
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:12,909
-It's actually a nightmare.
-It's, Iike, really hard.

503
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,778
-It's Iike an impossible dream.
- It's Iike sudoku.

504
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,475
okay, but he's not paying us
to advertise the fact

505
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:18,949
that he has
a perfectly average product.

506
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,851
He's paying us to be economical
with the truth.

507
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,685
So tell him from me
he's gotta go with the talking fish.

508
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,017
By the way,
your daughter is really good at her job.

509
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,156
-I know. That's the way she is.
-And she has great hair!

510
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,464
-ToM: It's healthy.
-okay.

511
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,676
I know. Yeah, but you know what?
It was fine.

512
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,840
But it would be really awesome,
I would... No.

513
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,280
There was a Iine. Sorry.

514
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,908
My watch is off by an hour.
Should I change it?

515
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,785
Uh, you came from New York, so,
yeah, you need to go back an hour.

516
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,258
Use Central Time.

517
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:06,963
You were Iaughing on the phone.
That was nice to see.

518
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,124
-I was?
-Yeah.

519
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,067
-It was just work.
-It was nice.

520
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,771
-Was it the fish?
-The what?

521
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,138
-The fish?
-Yeah, the client went with the fish.

522
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,036
They said they should give it a name.
I said we should call it Frank.

523
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:24,247
-Because of me?
-of course 'cause of you!

524
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,842
-No, not because of me. Really?
-Yeah. For real.

525
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,909
-Frank the fish?
-Frank the fish.

526
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,443
-No?
-What?

527
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,183
-Hi.
-Hey.

528
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,851
Hey, you should be at your desk,
shouldn't you?

529
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:37,260
Dad, this is Tom,
one of our creative directors.

530
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,753
-Tom, this is my dad, Frank.
-Hi, sir. Nice to meet you.

531
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,665
-Tom.
-So, what are you up to?

532
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,002
I was supposed to be heading
out of town to meet a client,

533
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,436
but the train got delayed.

534
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:50,707
-Hey, why don't you sit down?
-No, no, no, I'd be interrupting you.

535
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,505
-No, it's fine. It's fine.
-Really?

536
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,376
-Yeah. Sit down.
-ToM: Well, thank you.

537
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,847
So, do you Iive here
or are you just visiting?

538
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,051
No, no, I'm just staying the one night.

539
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,360
-Here, this is for you.
-What is it?

540
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,021
-You' see.
-Well, tell me.

541
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,123
No, you' see. You' see.
I didn't wanna send it in the mail.

542
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,566
-You' see.
-okay.

543
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,768
You know what I'm trying to do?

544
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,270
I'm trying to get us
all around the same table.

545
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,069
The same table.
Yeah, Iike we used to at Christmas.

546
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,606
Are you happy?

547
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,440
-What do you mean?
-Are you happy?

548
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,406
Yeah, of course I am. I'm...

549
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,112
Good. Good. Good girl.

550
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,288
A happy one. First one on my Iist.

551
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,043
Isn't it terrible about ice?

552
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,047
-ice?
-The storm sweeping up the coast.

553
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,805
Hmm.

554
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,923
My name is ice, so I took an interest.

555
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,728
-It's Greek, I think, ice.
-Is it Greek? oh.

556
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,198
-It means truth.
-Truth.

557
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,029
Yeah, well, I heard about it. I...

558
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,734
I was there a few days ago.
I must have just missed it.

559
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,340
-You're Iucky, then.
-Yeah, well, I'm always Iucky.

560
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,282
I'm always Iucky.

561
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,685
Amy, have you seen David?

562
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,754
No, not yet.
Why not?

563
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,866
Well, I had an appointment
with a guy at the prison,

564
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,334
but he didn't turn up.

565
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,769
And I went to the embassy
and found a lawyer,

566
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,055
but he can't meet till the morning.
I've just been running around.

567
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:06,409
Hopefully tomorrow
I'll start to get somewhere

568
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,708
-and we can tell Dad.
-  Okay.

569
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:11,581
Look, I'll call you as soon
as I know what's going on.

570
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,550
But, listen, don't worry. Okay?

571
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,221
Oh, sweet morning

572
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:22,692
Is your head not right

573
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:28,188
Did you heed my warning

574
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,836
This is the time of times

575
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,165
And your head feels like your body

576
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,775
Your mind is close behind

577
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:48,012
There's a teardrop on your shoulder

578
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,145
Says this is the time of times

579
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:52,021
Could you take a picture of me
in front of this?

580
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,072
Yeah.

581
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,096
And one more just to...

582
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,793
Like... Could you... Yeah.

583
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,411
CooR: okay, everybody,
it's a new day,

584
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,623
an opportunity for all of us
to make amends.

585
00:40:24,624 --> 00:40:26,656
So, why don't we start
at the beginning?

586
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,459
Horns, trumpets,
very percussive in the first section.

587
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,452
Strings, more energy in those bows.
Ready?

588
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,601
-It's fine. I' take you right through.
-Thank you.

589
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,171
They're rehearsing right now.

590
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,256
-Hey, Dad, what are you doing here?
-What am I doing?

591
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,928
I've come to see you conduct.

592
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,164
-What are you doing?
-I'm rehearsing.

593
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,465
-Aren't you conducting?
-Not today. No. I'm...

594
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:31,240
-You're playing the drum.
-I am. It's percussion.

595
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,007
It's what I do.

596
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:41,054
-I thought you were conducting.
-Not today. I' explain.

597
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,319
I should get back.

598
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,295
You just walked off the stage
and nobody noticed?

599
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,447
Come on, stop it.
What are you doing here?

600
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,990
I'm visiting. It's a surprise.

601
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,992
I came to spend some time
with my son, the conductor.

602
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,239
-That's my cue.
-Well, get back, get back.

603
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,709
okay.

604
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,694
-Ro That's very good.
-Very good. Yeah.

605
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:22,632
Never hit a drum in my Iife,
but suddenly I'm very good.

606
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,158
Without training, without skill,

607
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,534
without all the musical talent
that you have.

608
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,703
Never said I was conducting, Dad.

609
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,139
Yeah, well,
your mother said you were doing well,

610
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,511
that you were conducting
and composing and doing your music.

611
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,746
I am doing my music. It's percussion.
It suits me just fine.

612
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,615
But the drum?

613
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,384
It's Iow pressure, and I enjoy it.

614
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,752
I get to travel, the money's fine,
I got no ties.

615
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:59,732
Everybody said that you had a talent,
that you had a future.

616
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:03,840
People are polite, Dad. You know,
they don't always tell you the truth.

617
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,366
The truth is,
I was never quite good enough.

618
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:14,381
But all that education,
and now you're disappointed?

619
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,583
I'm not disappointed.

620
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,954
I'm not disappointed,
but you obviously are.

621
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:22,992
No, I'm not disappointed.
It just seems Iike a waste, that's all.

622
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,985
of what? What's it a waste of?
of your telephone wire?

623
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,863
No, no. It's not that. I didn't say that.

624
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,126
You know, I still compose,
and I conduct in my spare time,

625
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:35,672
but nobody wants to employ me
to do that professionally.

626
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,265
That's just the way it is.

627
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,299
Well, I guess I'm just saying
it's never too Iate. You could...

628
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,975
You could keep at it
and go back to studying,

629
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:46,482
-and I could help you out.
-It doesn't work Iike that, Dad.

630
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,816
If it was going to have happened,
it would have happened by now.

631
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:54,580
Besides, I'm not sure it's what I wanted.
I think maybe I was doing it for you.

632
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,486
I don't believe that.

633
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,860
Dad, the point is, this suits me just fine.
This is what I want.

634
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,835
Hey. Hey.

635
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,271
Are you managing okay at home?

636
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,906
-Yeah, I'm cooking every day.
-Cooking? Yeah?

637
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:18,236
-Do you know what you're doing?
-No, I just make it up, but...

638
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,975
Well, I thought we could spend
a couple of days together.

639
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,212
I... Dad, I fly to Europe this evening.

640
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,918
It's a big trip.
We gotta pack up this afternoon.

641
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,554
I wish I could, honestly, but you know...

642
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,257
I'm sorry, Dad.
That would have been great.

643
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,535
Well...

644
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,446
I went to see David in New York.
Is he still at the same address?

645
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,084
Yeah. I think so.

646
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,770
Yeah, I want to check his address
and phone number with you.

647
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,483
Sure.

648
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,443
Ro I need some fresh air.
right.

649
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:14,270
-Robert, come on. Don't smoke.
-What do you mean, don't smoke?

650
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,739
Don't smoke. You know better.
Come on.

651
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,139
Don't smoke.

652
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,341
right, I won't smoke.
Not in front of you.

653
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,316
Not if it upsets you,
but you know I do smoke sometimes.

654
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,716
Just so you know.

655
00:46:28,717 --> 00:46:31,721
-Anyway, you used to smoke.
-I know I used to smoke.

656
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:32,922
That's when I didn't know any better.

657
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,086
Now I do.
Your mother made me stop, too.

658
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:41,029
You know, I will, too, but occasionally
I do smoke. When I wanna quit, I' quit.

659
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,664
-Hey, Robert.
-Hey, Dave.

660
00:46:43,665 --> 00:46:47,103
Let me get this straight.
You worked in a wire factory

661
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,935
smoking a couple of packs a day,

662
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:53,432
but me being a percussionist
and having an occasional cigarette

663
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,446
-isn't good enough for you?
-Come on.

664
00:46:56,447 --> 00:47:01,017
You know, Mom used to say,
"Make your dad proud.

665
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,452
"He works so hard for us."
And I know you're not proud of me.

666
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,503
I know.

667
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,887
-That's not true.
-I can feel it. It's fine.

668
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,586
I'm working hard here.
I'm doing the best I can.

669
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,026
-Have your cigarette.
-What?

670
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,394
Have your cigarette, you need it.

671
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,431
No, you know what? I quit.

672
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,097
-Hi, Robert.
-Hey, I just quit smoking.

673
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,000
-Good job.
-Thanks.

674
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:29,712
I'm not quitting
because you want me to.

675
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,773
I'm quitting
'cause I know you don't think I can.

676
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,482
-Just to make that clear, okay?
-okay.

677
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,055
Anyway, you sounded good
on the drums.

678
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,958
I missed a beat
when I heard you coming in,

679
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,690
bumping your bag.
You kind of threw me off there.

680
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,163
Well, anyway,
what's a missed beat here and there?

681
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,896
It's good, sounded very good.

682
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,635
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

683
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:04,138
We don't see
each other very often. I wasn't trying to...

684
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,807
I'm sorry, you know. I just...

685
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:09,719
Look, you just gave up smoking.
You're gonna be a Iittle edgy.

686
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,314
Is that...
Is that what it is?

687
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,591
-Well, anyway, I'm sorry.
-Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

688
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:21,364
Hey, James,
I want to introduce you to my father.

689
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,230
-of course.
-This is James Green,

690
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,859
-famous conductor.
-Hi, James.

691
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,961
This is Frank, my dad.
Very famous dad.

692
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,504
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.

693
00:48:30,505 --> 00:48:31,774
-Good Iuck with everything.
-Thanks.

694
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,037
He's busy.

695
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,370
You got a girlfriend
you wanna tell me about?

696
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:44,285
-There was someone up until recently.
-But not anymore?

697
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:49,752
You know, she wanted to settle down.
She started talking about babies.

698
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,060
It's difficult with the traveling,
you know?

699
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,798
There's some girls in the orchestra.

700
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,362
-I noticed.
-oh, yeah? You noticed?

701
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,729
-I got my eye on a couple of them.
-Couple, yeah?

702
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,842
Well, you Iook...
You Iook after yourself, Robert.

703
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,075
I'm getting the whole family together.
Amy's gonna call you.

704
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:16,752
But if not, if she forgets, you call her
and you stay in touch with each other.

705
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,152
I will. I will.

706
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,958
-And you're happy?
-Happy, yeah.

707
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,223
I get paid to bang a big Ioud drum
all day. of course I'm happy.

708
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,166
okay, I'm...

709
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,229
Hey, I'm sorry that we couldn't spend
more time together.

710
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,613
Maybe I'm wrong

711
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:59,253
Amputate sympathy

712
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:04,959
Strength of my tongue

713
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,930
It's taken that liberty

714
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,109
Ro I don't know. He's...

715
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,078
I'm watching him right now.
He's buying his ticket.

716
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,214
He arrives in Vegas at 1 0:00
tomorrow morning, okay?

717
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,016
Okay. I'll be there.

718
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,884
No, no, no.
He doesn't want you to meet him.

719
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,153
-He wants it to be a surprise, okay?
-Of course I'm gonna meet him.

720
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,123
-If I want to meet him, I'll meet him.
-Rosie, he doesn't...

721
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,722
okay. But, you know,
he's not gonna Iike it.

722
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,595
How are you? Are you okay?

723
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,563
Yeah, I am, I guess...

724
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,297
You know, I wanted to spend some time
with him.

725
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:44,398
I'm free tonight and tomorrow,
but I just can't. I can't do it. I can't do it.

726
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,371
-I don't know what to say to him.
- I know. God, I know.

727
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,079
-Rosie.
-What?

728
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,777
-He's asking about David.
-Okay, I won't say anything.

729
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:57,019
Ro No, I mean, there's nothing
to say. What are we gonna say?

730
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,160
We don't know anything.

731
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,754
Play devil's advocate

732
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,863
Never I fear

733
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:14,036
Pay for it afterwards

734
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,999
How do I feel?

735
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:27,106
A glorified refugee

736
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:33,645
Nobody ever says goodbye

737
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,257
But I don't mind

738
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,096
just come home

739
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,535
Where you heading?

740
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,306
-Where you heading?
-Las Vegas.

741
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:58,312
Not from here you ain't, not tonight.
Let me see your ticket.

742
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,220
-What time you got?
-1 0:55.

743
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:08,824
The ticket office said that there was
a bus going to Las Vegas,

744
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,486
Bay 3, at 1 1 :00.

745
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:11,794
Well, now, all we know for sure

746
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,296
is that your watch ain't being
completely honest with you.

747
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,959
There was a bus at 1 1 :00,
but now it's nearly 1 2:00.

748
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,900
-1 2:00?
-Where you just come from?

749
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,460
New York, Chicago, Denver.

750
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:24,874
Seems Iike you put your watch
back one too many times, my friend.

751
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:29,073
There ain't no way you gonna catch
a bus that Ieft here an hour ago.

752
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:31,247
-There's no other bus?
-There's no other bus.

753
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,079
Not this time of night.

754
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,378
There's a truck stop
1 00 yards up the road.

755
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:40,682
If you're Iucky, you might pick up a Iift
and catch the night train.

756
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,351
okay. Thank you.

757
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:51,432
I'm wondering, "Why is this guy
trying to see his whole family,

758
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:53,636
"all over the country,
all in the same trip?"

759
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,071
Well, I'm not dying,
if that's what you're thinking.

760
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,233
Hey, I'm not thinking anything.

761
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,073
I'm just trying to visit the kids
and surprise them.

762
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:06,208
Their mother's always kept an eye
on them, and now it's up to me, so...

763
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,644
-You Iost your wife?
-About eight months ago.

764
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:13,883
I Iost my husband.
Just over a year now.

765
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,450
I Iost him to drink, but it was my fault.
I was stupid.

766
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,630
Ignored all the signs,
you know how you do?

767
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,661
I Iisten to that radio all day in this cab.

768
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,967
We got ourselves an epidemic
going on out there.

769
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:31,774
You know, people eating too much,
drinking too much,

770
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,073
killing themselves, basically.

771
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,670
Making up excuses all along the way.

772
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,313
Because facing up to the truth
ain't always easy.

773
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,477
-No.
-Man, people Iike things easy.

774
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,079
-That's what they're used to.
-Yeah.

775
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,654
-No one Iikes to get hurt.
-Hmm.

776
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,020
No. Nobody Iikes to get hurt.

777
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,526
I stop off in Reno.
There's a night train from there,

778
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,433
gets you into Vegas in the morning.

779
00:54:00,434 --> 00:54:02,972
otherwise, there's a cheap Iittle motel
where I shut down,

780
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,999
if you don't wanna travel
through the night.

781
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,410
Don't get all shy on me.
That wasn't a proposition.

782
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,717
-No, I...
-Yeah, I sleep in the truck, all right?

783
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,058
-Co Take care, Frank.
-I appreciate it. Thank you.

784
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,596
-Are you all right?
-Don't touch me.

785
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:04,489
-I'm not touching anybody. I'm just...
-Don't touch me.

786
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:09,703
You okay?
Do your parents know where you are?

787
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,971
If I give you some money,
will you eat something?

788
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,204
Yeah, I'm clean, man.

789
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,442
-Do you need some money?
-I could use some money.

790
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,980
I mean,
everyone can use some money, right?

791
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:25,954
okay. Here you go. Here.

792
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,350
You're okay?

793
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:35,023
- Yeah. What's with the questions?
-Well, you could say thank you.

794
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,295
-Could what?
-You could say thank you.

795
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,326
I gave you some money.
You could say thank you.

796
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,065
Hey, you're right.

797
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:45,274
I'm sorry, man, you're right.
Yeah. I forgot my manners.

798
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,836
You got a couple of hundred dollars
in there and this is my thanks.

799
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,418
Need that?

800
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:13,969
ease don't do anything. Just...
I need... That's my medication. No. No.

801
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,474
oh, God, no.

802
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:11,059
j
I'm not here at the moment,

803
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,187
and Frank is probably in the garden.

804
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,288
Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

805
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:07,610
David?

806
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,713
David?

807
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,956
of all my children, you're the one
that I worry about the most.

808
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,653
I'm trying, Dad.

809
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,497
-Dad!
-David!

810
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,595
Tell me when I can see you.

811
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,036
Dad?

812
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,947
Robert, Dad wasn't on the bus.
What?

813
00:58:45,948 --> 00:58:47,689
I met the 10:00 bus
like you said,

814
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:51,126
and everyone else got off,
but he's not on it.

815
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,755
Well... Well, did you look
in the station? I mean...

816
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,095
Yeah, of course,
I looked everywhere.

817
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,261
I don't know what to tell you.
He was doing the 1 0: 00.

818
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,430
So how can he not be on it?

819
00:59:02,434 --> 00:59:04,973
Are you all right, Frank?

820
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,808
Listen, the damnedest thing happened.

821
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,936
I was brushing my teeth this morning,

822
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:12,414
and I left my bottle of pills
right on the edge of the sink.

823
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,150
Well, I knocked the whole thing
right into the sink, and it got all wet.

824
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,386
- There's nothing left. In the sink.
- In the sink. Gee, God damn it,

825
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,521
-you're as bad as me, you know that.
- The damnedest thing.

826
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,223
Listen, I'll write a new prescription,
all right?

827
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,385
just pop in. I'll leave it in the reception.

828
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,957
Is that the only way to get them?
Go to reception?

829
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,660
I have to come in?

830
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:33,897
The garden is doing... Is great... I'm...
It's doing... I'm Iooking right at it.

831
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,617
Looking really good, really good.

832
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:43,043
Hello?
Hey, it's me. Are you home?

833
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,377
No. I'm waiting for you.
Where are you?

834
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:46,782
He told you I was coming,
didn't he?

835
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,841
No.

836
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,513
I told him not to tell you
I was coming, and he told you.

837
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,236
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, glamour girl.

838
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,301
-Welcome to Vegas, Dad.
-Yeah. Thanks.

839
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:23,051
Ro I didn't order a stretch.
I just wanted something comfortable.

840
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,942
It's good. No, it's got plenty of Ieg room,
that's for sure.

841
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,480
That's why they call it a stretch.

842
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,719
-I missed you.
-I miss you.

843
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,423
-I've been worried about you.
-Tell me about your show.

844
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:39,865
okay, we were at the Bellagio,
and it was a big production.

845
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:44,696
Lots of underwater dance scenes,
and I was the mermaid,

846
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,333
-the Iead.
-of course.

847
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,777
-And you would have Ioved it.
-Well, when can I go?

848
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,440
-It finished Iast week.
-It finished?

849
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,475
Yeah. Next time you have to fly out
and come see me. I just...

850
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,978
I didn't wanna bother you this time

851
01:00:58,979 --> 01:01:00,689
because I knew that
you weren't feeling well,

852
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,022
-but Iook at you.
-Well, Iook at you.

853
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,493
A dancer in a Las Vegas show
on the big stage,

854
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,725
just what you always wanted.
Are you happy? Hmm?

855
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,795
-Very happy.
-Yeah?

856
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,166
So, the only thing missing now is...
Anything?

857
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,802
-A man. I know.
-Well...

858
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,304
- Papa loves mambo
-Papa loves mambo

859
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,335
-Mama loves mambo
-Mama loves mambo

860
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:26,280
Havin' their fling again
Younger than spring again

861
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,510
Feelin' that zing again, wow

862
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,280
-This is where you Iive?
-No, this is an elevator.

863
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:33,686
Very good.

864
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:38,060
I think you' Iike the apartment.
It's very spacious.

865
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,790
-Well, I'm happy sleeping on a couch.
-Really?

866
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,695
-Really.
-okay.

867
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,971
-Wow.
-You Iike it?

868
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,006
-It's...
-Very me?

869
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,031
Very you. Very impressive.

870
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,577
-Well, do you wanna see your room?
-Sure.

871
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,478
okay. Come on.

872
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:08,521
So, bed or sofa? Sofa or bed?

873
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,756
-This is my room?
-Mmm-hmm.

874
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:14,963
-It's huge. Look at that television.
-I know.

875
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:18,734
oh, I've booked us dinner
at a place called the Stratosphere.

876
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,396
-Do you know what that is?
-No.

877
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:24,304
It's a revolving restaurant
800 feet above the ground.

878
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,604
-Stay just Iike that.
-okay.

879
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,326
okay, one more time.

880
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,546
I' just get that.
Stay there, I' be right back.

881
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,913
I'm gonna take another picture.

882
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,949
-Jilly, hi.
-Hi. How are you?

883
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,387
Good. Come on in. I want you to meet...

884
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,623
I need a favor. I have to go
pick up Paul from the airport,

885
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,092
-and I haven't got the car seat.
-okay. I want you to meet my dad.

886
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,754
-Great. Hi.
- Hi.

887
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,060
-Dad, this is my friend, Jilly.
-How you doing?

888
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,732
-Hi. I'm Jilly.
-What was it?

889
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:53,001
-Hi, Jilly.
-It's a pleasure to meet you.

890
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:55,971
-How are you doing?
-How are you doing? Who's this guy?

891
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:59,202
This is Max,
and we could really use a favor.

892
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,676
Could you watch him for a few hours?

893
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:05,213
Yeah. Well, the only thing is, is that we
were gonna head out Iater for dinner.

894
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,982
You know, it's fine.
You know, I'm gonna pop downstairs.

895
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,851
-I can just see if Helen's around.
-We could stay in if you want.

896
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,386
No. I think you guys should go out.

897
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,378
No, you're tired. It's fine.

898
01:03:13,379 --> 01:03:15,457
-I'm easy, whatever it is.
-We' take him.

899
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,058
-You sure? You sure?
-Here, give him to me.

900
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,294
Thank you so much.
Well, Iisten, I should be back in time

901
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,863
for you guys to go out anyway.
It' just be a couple of hours.

902
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:22,956
But thank you again.

903
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,969
Ro okay, yeah, it's fine.
Well, I can bathe him.

904
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,742

Honestly.

905
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,710
I' be all right. okay. Bye.

906
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:39,874
Hmm?

907
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,974
Um, slight problem.

908
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,578
-Jilly?
-Yeah.

909
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,246
Paul's flight was cancelled,
so he's stuck in

910
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,054
and she's going to pick him up.

911
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,856
So, that means
we have Max for the night.

912
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,622
-okay.
-Is that okay?

913
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,490
It's okay.

914
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,364
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

915
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,333
Ro okay, just stay up.
Give me your arm.

916
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:45,370
-Do you want me to get that?
-No, Dad, just Ieave it. It's fine.

917
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,038
-okay.
-Ro Thanks.

918
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,677
Keep your eyes closed.
Keep your eyes closed.

919
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:51,519
Hi. I'm not here right now,

920
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,283

921
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,315

Look, I need the apartment back
sooner than I thought. So call me.

923
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,800
Ro  Stop splashing!

924
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,681
A nice apartment.

925
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,488
Yeah, it's a Iittle big, though.

926
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,390
-You bought it?
-No, I'm renting it, but I got a good deal.

927
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,726
Mmm-hmm.

928
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:44,034
Listen, I'm gonna Ieave tomorrow.
I'm gonna go back home.

929
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:47,736
-But you just got here.
-I know, but it's been a Iong trip.

930
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,905
I'm running Iow on my medication.
I just thought I'd...

931
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,313
Well, can't we get you a refill?

932
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,447
It's been a Iong trip, honey.

933
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,857
Yeah. You Iook tired.

934
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:07,262
I'm okay. I should get home.

935
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,924
Would you be okay with that?

936
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,831
Yeah. Course.

937
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,972
You should do what you want.
Here, take that.

938
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,703
I was thinking of flying.

939
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,941
-You never fly.
-I know.

940
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,121
Ro Thank you.

941
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,790
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

942
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,829
You didn't really wanna eat out,
did you?

943
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:51,472
No. I didn't. Not 800 feet above
the ground in a revolving restaurant.

944
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,945
Remember when your mother
taught you how to eat spaghetti?

945
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,713
Yep.

946
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,526
Sometimes I pick up the phone
to dial her number,

947
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,828
and then I remember.

948
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,369
Keep calling next time.

949
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:25,168
The number's still the same,
and I'm still on the other end.

950
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,369
-okay.
-Yeah?

951
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,520
-Yes.
-I don't know what it is with you kids.

952
01:07:29,521 --> 01:07:30,912
You always told
your mother everything.

953
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:35,043
You never told me anything. You were
always on the phone with her.

954
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,747
I'd pick up the phone, I'd say, "Hello,"
you'd say "Hi, Dad. Mom there?"

955
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:41,348
It wasn't that bad. It was just that

956
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:44,826
Mom was easier to talk to
and you always worried so much

957
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:48,194
-if everything wasn't perfect.
-No, that's not true.

958
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,896
-We could just talk to Mom.
-oh, but you couldn't talk to me?

959
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:57,394
Well, she was a good Iistener.
You were a good talker.

960
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,606
Well, so that's good.
We made a good team.

961
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,269
Yeah.

962
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,977
You wouldn't change anything,
would you?

963
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,877
You pushed us pretty hard.

964
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,154
No. That's not true. I...

965
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,254
You didn't all feel that way, did you?

966
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,228
I think David felt it the most.

967
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,089
Yeah, well...

968
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,301
I can see that.

969
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,499
He so never wanted to Iet you down.

970
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,373
I know.

971
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:40,348
I was never any harder on him,
as far as I could see.

972
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,375
You were all different,
and Iook at him today.

973
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,651
Did I tell you
I went to see him in New York?

974
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:49,090
-No.
-Yeah, he wasn't there,

975
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,493
but I saw some of his artwork
downstairs in a gallery

976
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:56,056
below his apartment. It was right there
on display. It was just beautiful.

977
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,525
So Iook what happened to him.

978
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,331
He turned out okay.
You turned out okay.

979
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,769
I don't know, Dad.

980
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,608
How can you say that? Look at you.

981
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:11,170
You've wanted to be a dancer
ever since you were a Iittle girl.

982
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:13,738
You were gifted,
and nobody pushed you.

983
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,046
-What about your plans?
-It all worked out.

984
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:19,020
What did you wanna be
when you were my age?

985
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,479
I didn't have any plans.

986
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,381
I just wanted to hold down a job

987
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:27,020
and find somebody crazy enough
to marry me, Iike your mother.

988
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,228
But when you guys came along,
things were different.

989
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:32,467
There were opportunities.

990
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,203
What kind of father would I have been
if I hadn't pushed you? Huh?

991
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,729
So there wasn't anything you wanted
to achieve?

992
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:42,369
No, I didn't really think much about it.
Never really gave it much thought.

993
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,440
I wanted to do
was just be a good father, that's all.

994
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,323
Ro So you've got
your boarding pass,

995
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:04,423
and you're all checked in,
and we know your gate.

996
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,262
So?

997
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,436
I' come visit you as soon as I can,
I promise.

998
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:13,498
I'd Iike that. I wanna get us
all around the same table together.

999
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,542
-At Christmas?
-or before, it's up to you.

1000
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,444
Great. Count me in.

1001
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:20,707
oh.

1002
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,242
Here.

1003
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,818
What's this?

1004
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,353
I had to give it to each of you.

1005
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,117
-Well, shall I open it?
-No, open it Iater.

1006
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,320
-Are you sure?
-Sure I'm sure.

1007
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,621
okay.

1008
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,629
okay.

1009
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,295
-Be good.
-Just for you.

1010
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,838
-Be good.
-I will.

1011
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,593
Bye, Dad.

1012
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,768
Have a good flight.

1013
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:44,932
Rosie, where's Dad?

1014
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,265
He's on his way home.
I just left him.

1015
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,736
What did you find out?

1016
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,630
David was caught
buying some drugs in a bar.

1017
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:53,899
No.

1018
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,843
He got sick so quickly
that they now think

1019
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,645
he may have panicked
and swallowed some of the drugs

1020
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,772
when he was arrested.

1021
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,044
Is he okay?
Have you seen him?

1022
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,108
Not yet.
He was taken to a hospital.

1023
01:12:03,109 --> 01:12:05,453
I'm there now,
but they're not being very helpful.

1024
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,853
What do you mean?

1025
01:12:06,854 --> 01:12:09,857
I keep asking if he's here,
but I can't get a straight answer.

1026
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:13,123
Listen, the lawyer's with me
and the guy from the embassy's here.

1027
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,789
I need you to call Robert.

1028
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:16,597
I promised I'd call him
before his concert,

1029
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:19,726
tell him what's going on.
Can you do that for me?

1030
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,894
Yeah.

1031
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,845
Excuse me?
How much Ionger before we Iand?

1032
01:12:38,846 --> 01:12:42,290
Forty minutes, but there's a storm
so it might take a Iittle Ionger.

1033
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,758
-A storm?
-It's okay.

1034
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,192
We go around it, not through it.

1035
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:49,388
-Can I have some more water, please?
-Sure.

1036
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:56,771
Excuse me.

1037
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,784
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain

1038
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,685
has turned on the seatbelt sign,

1039
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,850
so we ask you to please return
to your seats as soon as possible.

1040
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:23,022
Sir, you need to push your table up.
Thank you.

1041
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,466
Sir, is everything all right?

1042
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:47,015
okay, sir. You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

1043
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,182
Just breathe for me.
You're gonna be fine.

1044
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,761
Come on, it's ready.
Everybody sit down.

1045
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,927
Hey, David. Come on!

1046
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,464
-Thank you.
-How come you're home, Dad?

1047
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,005
-I took the day off work.
-But you'd never do that.

1048
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,908
I know, but I wanted to spend
some time with you guys.

1049
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,879
-Is anything wrong?
-No, nothing is wrong.

1050
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,083
Well, you know,
actually there is something.

1051
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,676
You know,
I've been asking myself a question

1052
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,953
that's been Iike a puzzle,
and I can't figure it out.

1053
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,357
Let's stop eating for a minute.

1054
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:31,589
I keep asking myself
why you all Iied to me,

1055
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,634
all of you.

1056
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:38,639
Amy, Jeff wore the same shirt to work
the morning after I stayed.

1057
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,609
He doesn't Iive with you anymore,
does he?

1058
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,376
He Ieft home about three months ago.

1059
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,211
There's another woman.
That's why Jack hates him.

1060
01:14:47,212 --> 01:14:50,184
When that man Tom came over to me
at the station and shook my hand,

1061
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,517
he wanted to make an impression,
didn't he?

1062
01:14:52,518 --> 01:14:55,890
You pulled a chair up before he came
over 'cause you were expecting him.

1063
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:57,950
Tom was waiting at the station.

1064
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,861
I wanted to know that you'd met him.
I didn't want to miss the opportunity.

1065
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:05,389
In case I get sick
and we never get the chance to meet?

1066
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:16,774
Robert.

1067
01:15:16,775 --> 01:15:18,980
I think we should go in.
I think I felt some rain.

1068
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,382
There were posters all over the city.
You weren't going to Europe.

1069
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:24,719
You weren't even performing that night.
We could have spent time together.

1070
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,320
But you Iied to me.
You didn't wanna be with me.

1071
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:30,655
No, the truth is, Dad, there are
Iots of things that we don't tell you,

1072
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,252
but that doesn't mean
that we want to hurt you.

1073
01:15:33,253 --> 01:15:35,029
Mom didn't always tell you everything
and you know that.

1074
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,397
Don't blame your mother for this,
and wipe your mouth.

1075
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,393
Rosie, the baby is yours, isn't it?

1076
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,565
I was going to tell you.

1077
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:52,543
-Go on. Tell him the rest.
-Robert, shut up.

1078
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,049
-Go on. I' tell him.
-Shut up.

1079
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,184
She doesn't know
if she Iikes boys or girls.

1080
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,914
Ro Robert, stop it.

1081
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,917
Did your mother know
you were pregnant?

1082
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,322
And she kept it from me.
Why would she do that?

1083
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:11,389
We were going to tell you,
but then Mom got sick.

1084
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,398
I didn't wanna disappoint you.

1085
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,643
David, do you still Iive in New York
at that apartment?

1086
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:24,571
No.

1087
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,013
-Then where can I find you?
-I can't tell you.

1088
01:16:27,014 --> 01:16:29,317
Tell me where I can find you
and when I can see you.

1089
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:31,248
I don't wanna see you, Dad.

1090
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,187
No, stop... Do not Iaugh at me.

1091
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,917
Tell me the truth.

1092
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:40,689
Wipe that smirk off your face.
Wipe the smirk off your face!

1093
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:43,931
I have your skateboard right in the shed
over there. I know exactly where it is.

1094
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,366
I' burn the damn thing! You hear me?

1095
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,565
-Don't Iaugh. Don't Iaugh. Quiet!
-A two-by-four with wheels!

1096
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,234
After everything I've done for you,
this is all you can do is Iaugh?

1097
01:16:53,235 --> 01:16:56,110
When I'm asking you about something
that's worrying me?

1098
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,375
Jesus! David!

1099
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:00,548
Your mother always asked me
why I was so hard on you.

1100
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:04,349
This is why. This is exactly why!
Have some respect!

1101
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:21,525
-So what am I supposed to do?
- Act as though nothing's wrong.

1102
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,970
That's what Mom did.
It's best for all of us.

1103
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:26,240
I can't do that.
I can't act as if nothing happened.

1104
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:28,641
What do I tell your mother?
What do I say?

1105
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:31,278
Anyway, she won't ask or anything
'cause she's dead.

1106
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,576
David!

1107
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,043
That's it. I've had enough!

1108
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,356
-I'm out of here.
-Me, too! I'm out of here!

1109
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,656
Come on!

1110
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,358
Tell her nothing.

1111
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:54,161
-How can I do that?
-If you Iove her as she Ioves you,

1112
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:57,638
then you' tell her
what she wants to hear.

1113
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,970
Tell her that we are all fine.

1114
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,430
Dad?

1115
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:31,927
At Iast. I finally have my family
in the same room.

1116
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,394
Is David here?

1117
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,463
Rosie's here, and Robert.

1118
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,404
How are you feeling?

1119
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:43,675
-Was it a heart attack?
-They're not sure.

1120
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,505
Amy, is he telling the truth?

1121
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:50,450
Ro The doctors are waiting
for some test results.

1122
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,249
Come on. You don't have to Iie to me.

1123
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:58,019
I always find it so hard
to believe all of you now.

1124
01:19:58,693 --> 01:19:59,955
Come on.

1125
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:04,229
They suspected a heart attack.

1126
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:09,796
They ran some tests,
and they got the results,

1127
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,965
and it was a heart attack.

1128
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,673
-A mild one.
-Good. A start, at Ieast.

1129
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:21,238
I didn't wanna worry you
until you had a chance

1130
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,911
to come to terms with what happened.

1131
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,144
Well, you can worry me, all of you.

1132
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,182
I'm a father of four, I expect that.

1133
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:35,156
I know you all have problems.

1134
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:40,734
I know that, and I can see
you've been keeping things from me.

1135
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:45,339
-But right now, there's something...
-Dad, maybe you should rest.

1136
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,673
No, I will rest,
but I need an answer to a question.

1137
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:54,145
You were honest with your mother,
and I want you to be honest with me.

1138
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,850
It's all right. I'm okay.

1139
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,747
I can handle it.

1140
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:04,320
I... I know David is in trouble,

1141
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:07,654
and I just wanna know where he is

1142
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,627
and how soon I can see him.

1143
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:16,967
So who's gonna tell me?

1144
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,598
Why don't you take it...
Why don't you rest for a while?

1145
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,943
What is it?

1146
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,750
Just tell me the truth.

1147
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:32,911
Dad, I'm sorry.

1148
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:41,090
David died, Dad. I'm sorry.

1149
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,124
No, I... That's not true.

1150
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,435
-Tell me that's not true.
-Ro I'm sorry, Dad.

1151
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,698
No.

1152
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,571
Ro He moved out
of his apartment and...

1153
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:55,667
No.

1154
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,008
Ro...we knew that he was traveling.

1155
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:01,140
And then we started getting calls
from Mexico.

1156
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:06,578
There was a Iot of confusion. We didn't
wanna tell you until we were sure.

1157
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,020
No, no...

1158
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:14,191
Ro He had a Iot of problems.
He wasn't happy, Dad.

1159
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:18,190
He's been having a tough time
since Mom died.

1160
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,201
We've all been worried about him.

1161
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:24,968
Yeah, but not for sure. I...

1162
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:29,509
It was Mexico. It could be anyone.
It could be a mistake.

1163
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,809
-It could be.
- I flew out there after you visited.

1164
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,941
-Huh?
-I flew out there after you visited, and...

1165
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,545
That's why you couldn't stay.
That's why we all made excuses and...

1166
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:44,217
No. No, no, no...

1167
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:46,819
Not my son. That's not my son.

1168
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,723
How?

1169
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,998
They said it was an overdose.

1170
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:08,505
No, not my son. That's not my son.

1171
01:23:37,092 --> 01:23:40,814
What are you gonna do
when you grow up?

1172
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:42,549
I wanna be a painter
and do my pictures.

1173
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,485
No, not a painter.
Painters paint walls,

1174
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:45,612
and dogs pee on walls.

1175
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:48,850
You're gonna be an artist.
You gonna work hard?

1176
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,450
Yes, Dad.
You gonna make me proud?

1177
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,160
Sorry about
how everything's worked out, Dad.

1178
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,506
It's not your fault.

1179
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,944
I've been thinking about
what I wanna do when I grow up.

1180
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,818
Yeah? And what did you decide?

1181
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:27,053
I might still be an artist or I might
just do a normal job, Iike a painter.

1182
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,960
I'd be proud of you
no matter what you did.

1183
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,263
-Really?
-Really.

1184
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,197
Good.

1185
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,239
I told Mom I wouldn't be Iong.

1186
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:48,876
-Give her my Iove.
-I will.

1187
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,977
Well, I' see you, Dad.

1188
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,724
-David?
-Hmm?

1189
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:01,560
I'm sorry.

1190
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,059
It's not your fault, Dad.

1191
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,569
David?

1192
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,243
David?

1193
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:55,241
Well, it was a big trip.

1194
01:27:56,838 --> 01:28:00,330
And if you ask me what I Iearned,
I'd have to tell you I'm not sure.

1195
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:05,906
I know if I could do it all over again,
I would ask Iess of the kids.

1196
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:10,874
As Iong as they were happy,
that would be fine with me.

1197
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:15,355
I know I have to stop thinking of them
as if they're still children.

1198
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:19,725
I can't tell them what to do anymore.
They have to find their own way.

1199
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,564
And sometimes

1200
01:28:23,565 --> 01:28:26,366
you talked to me about things that

1201
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:29,393
I should have Iistened to you
more carefully.

1202
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:34,167
You presented me with the details
of our children's Iives, and I...

1203
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,603
I... I ignored them.

1204
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,607
And for that...

1205
01:28:47,688 --> 01:28:51,625
But that isn't what you want to hear,
I know.

1206
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:55,494
What you want is the news.
Well, the news is this.

1207
01:28:56,597 --> 01:29:00,693
Robert, Amy and Rosie promised
to visit me for the holidays,

1208
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:03,670
and you know what?
This time I believe them.

1209
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,305
And David...

1210
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,441
David...

1211
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:13,245
I hope he' spend Christmas with you.

1212
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:23,120
I went back to New York
to buy David's painting.

1213
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:28,592
The portrait, I know which one
you mean, but I'm afraid it's sold.

1214
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,028
It is sold?

1215
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,399
Well...

1216
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:37,563
-Were you familiar with the artist or...
-Yeah, I...

1217
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:40,938
Yeah, not as much as I would
Iike to have been, but, yeah.

1218
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,340
Thank you.

1219
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:43,910
Why don't you give me your details?

1220
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,641
If anything of David's comes in,
I' Iet you know.

1221
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,733
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

1222
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:55,079
I just saw your name. I'm stupid.
I should have realized.

1223
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,556
That's okay.

1224
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,591
I'm sorry.

1225
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:04,453
You know, I knew David. He used to
hang out at the gallery all the time,

1226
01:30:04,454 --> 01:30:06,566
and he used to say
that if it wasn't for his dad,

1227
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,229
that he never would have
become an artist.

1228
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:11,938
He said he would have
ended up painting walls

1229
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:14,100
and that dogs pee on walls.

1230
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:19,777
Look, we might have something of his
in storage. I can check if you'd Iike.

1231
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:21,839
-okay, sure.
-okay.

1232
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,941
Now, I won't pretend
David's work was very commercial.

1233
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,112
Here it is.

1234
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:33,517
He had his own style,
and he wasn't concerned with fashion.

1235
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:45,765
But for what it's worth,
I thought he was really special.

1236
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:04,923
Thank you.

1237
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:19,902
Hello, this is Frank. I'm not out...
I mean, I'm not here at the moment.

1238
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,936
I'm probably out shopping
for the holidays.

1239
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:27,270
But if you leave a message,
I will call you back. Thank you.

1240
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:32,419
Don't laugh, but I promised to cook
the turkey for the first time this year.

1241
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,322
I got the whole family coming.
What's the biggest bird you got?

1242
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,654
Half a dozen of them.

1243
01:31:36,655 --> 01:31:38,959
And treat the children to some
expensive wine.

1244
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,450
-You got some reds on the right.
-Excellent choice, if I may say so, sir.

1245
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,658
-That's the sale price. Yeah.
-It's the sale price?

1246
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,998
I'm even thinking
of replacing the old tree.

1247
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:52,528
If I gave it to you for any cheaper,
I wouldn't be making any money.

1248
01:31:52,529 --> 01:31:55,909
Let me tighten it. It has to...
You're Ietting it droop too much.

1249
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:59,175
I need a Iittle more slack to
get around... How does this Iook?

1250
01:31:59,176 --> 01:32:01,648
-Dad's side's perfect.
-Ro You kidding me?

1251
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:02,946
Yours needs work.

1252
01:32:02,947 --> 01:32:04,317
Ro oh, yeah?
Ro Yeah.

1253
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:07,436
-Thank you.
-Ro What's that sound?

1254
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,351
-What's that?
-Turkey.

1255
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,758
-You're timing the turkey?
-Yeah.

1256
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:15,825
Ro That's so efficient.

1257
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,893
Hey! Jesus!

1258
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,130
Now you're...

1259
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:26,840
It's not cooked yet, Dad.
I just checked it.

1260
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:30,174
-You just checked it?
-Yeah, the juices are still red.

1261
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:35,848
Well, why don't you stick
to the potatoes and I' do the turkey?

1262
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,476
okay.

1263
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,124
This is you!

1264
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:49,552
Look, it has your name
and the third grade written on its butt.

1265
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:52,358
-Do you remember that?
-I remember when I made this.

1266
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,526
Ro Yeah.

1267
01:32:55,496 --> 01:32:57,037
-Ro Hey, Dad, are you okay?
-Yeah.

1268
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,972
Check that turkey, Grandpa.

1269
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:07,837
Dad, that's a big bird.
You'd better cook it properly.

1270
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:09,416
-Just check the Ieg, Dad.
-Don't worry.

1271
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,476
-Just to make sure.
-I will. I will.

1272
01:33:11,477 --> 01:33:14,487
Well, Mom actually would have cooked
it for at Ieast another 30 minutes.

1273
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:17,824
Yeah, well, there's something I
need to tell all of you about your mother.

1274
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:20,126
As much as I Ioved her
and as a good cook as she was,

1275
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:23,797
in all the 41 years we've been married,
she always over-cooked the turkey,

1276
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:27,461
every single year.
I just never had the heart to tell her.

1277
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:31,794
right. Perfect.

1278
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:49,317
Hi, honey.
Will you help me get him burped?

1279
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:50,881
There we go.

1280
01:33:50,882 --> 01:33:52,759
This one's yours,
if you want, Robert.

1281
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,354
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

1282
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:58,422
-I'm kind of on a diet anyway.
-Ro Good boy.

1283
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:01,533
-Where's his tray?
- Grandpa, watch out.

1284
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:04,935
Watch out. okay, that's hot.

1285
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,703
Your family is making its way
in the world,

1286
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:13,510
and you can be proud of the children
and their achievements.

1287
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:18,742
And, if you were to ask me,
I would have to say in all honesty,

1288
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:23,256
-everybody's fine.
- Are you hungry?

1289
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,525
Everybody's fine.

1290
01:34:26,526 --> 01:34:27,260
- Babysitter.
-Yeah, I know.

1291
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:28,891
- Babysitter.
-Yeah, I know.

1292
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,002
For so long

1293
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,240
I was out in the cold

1294
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:54,754
And I taught myself to believe
every story I told

1295
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,222
It was fun hanging on to the moon

1296
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,387
Heading into the sun

1297
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,763
But it's been too long

1298
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:07,924
Now I wanna come home

1299
01:35:11,472 --> 01:35:14,339
Came so close

1300
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:17,434
To the edge of defeat

1301
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:21,236
But I made my way in the shade

1302
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:23,307
Keeping out of the heat

1303
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:27,583
It was fun shooting out of the stars

1304
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:29,646
Looking into the sun

1305
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:33,125
But it's been too long

1306
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,522
Now I wanna come home

1307
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:44,397
Home, where there's nothing
but sweet surrender

1308
01:35:45,372 --> 01:35:49,206
To the memories from afar

1309
01:35:50,878 --> 01:35:56,908
Home, to the place
where truth lies waiting

1310
01:35:57,885 --> 01:36:02,049
We remember who we are

1311
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:09,424
For too long

1312
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:12,663
I was out on my own

1313
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:18,166
Every day I spent trying to prove
I could make it alone

1314
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:22,871
It was fun hanging on to the moon

1315
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:25,037
Heading into the sun

1316
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:28,571
But it's been too long

1317
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,812
Now I wanna come home

1318
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,634
Home

1319
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:11,114
For so long

1320
01:37:11,425 --> 01:37:13,950
I was out in the cold

1321
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:20,322
But I taught myself to believe
every story I told

1322
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:24,536
It was fun hanging on to the moon

1323
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:26,870
Heading into the sun

1324
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,999
But it's been too long

1325
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,475
Now I wanna come home

1326
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:36,746
Yeah, it's been too long

1327
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:39,542
Now I wanna come home

1328
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:42,984
Been too long

1329
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:46,451
Now I wanna come home
