1
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,804
<i>So, even if Columbus got lost and
wasn't the first to discover America,</i>

2
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,682
he is still my hero.

3
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:42,270
He was really brave to sail his
tiny ship over a really big ocean.

4
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,981
And because of him, we get
Columbus Day off from school.

5
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,737
Thank you, Heather. Ronnie?

6
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:52,822
Tell us about your hero.

7
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:07,920
What is he writing?

8
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,882
Hachiko was my Grandfather
Wilson's dog.

9
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:18,055
Everyone called Hachi a
mystery dog because,

10
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:20,557
they never really knew
where he came from.

11
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:25,646
Maybe Hachi escaped from
a dog pound.

12
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,108
Or maybe he jumped out
of somebody's car,

13
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,819
from some place faraway
like Florida or New Jersey.

14
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:38,908
But no matter how, Hachi was lost.

15
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:09,415
No matter how it happened,

16
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:13,669
a long time ago, in a town my
grandfather lived in...

17
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,715
Hachi appeared at the train station.

18
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,134
And that's where their story begin.

19
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,881
<i>Six days?</i>

20
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,508
- I'll miss it.
- Yes.

21
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,801
<i>That was great, a lot of music.</i>

22
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,388
<i>No, no, no, I'll walk. I'll walk.</i>

23
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:08,432
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

24
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,980
Hey, buddy... you lost?

25
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,065
Come here.

26
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,735
Come ...

27
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,656
You lost here, bud?

28
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,410
Someone must be looking for you.

29
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,292
This guy was wandering around.

30
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:36,459
<i>- Really... out on the platform?</i>
- On the platform, yeah!

31
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,754
<i>Good for you for finding him.</i>

32
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:41,465
Yeah. Well...

33
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,612
I tell you, this little crate
out there is broken.

34
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:45,761
I don't know what's going on but,

35
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:48,973
Hey, someone gonna be
here for him, sorry.

36
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:50,745
- Yeah.
- You just hold him here.

37
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,518
Please hold him till they comes.

38
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:53,978
No, I can't... I can't do that.

39
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,187
- I can't do that, Professor.
- What?

40
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,399
Well, he was here... No one was
gonna leave this dog, this--

41
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,276
I... know, I know that. I know,
no one's gonna leave it there.

42
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:03,153
They'll be back for it so...

43
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:05,031
You take him with ya, and
when anyone show's up...

44
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:06,906
I'll tell them that you've it.

45
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,367
- Someone gonna be here.
- Yeah.

46
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,826
You know, you don't understand.

47
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:11,286
Someone will come for him.
Really, just --

48
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:14,206
I'm gonna have to put this in here for
like the whole night if nobody comes.

49
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:16,146
If they're not here,
I'll locked him in here and

50
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:18,084
he'll be safe for the night but...

51
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,713
I... I... all I can do is take him to
the pound in the morning.

52
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,271
Well, today's Friday.

53
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:43,110
Know where you went...
Meanwhile stay with me.

54
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:47,072
In a warm house, plenty of company,
you'll be alright.

55
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:50,283
What? Yeah, you'll like it.

56
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:53,680
Sh-sh-sh ...

57
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,350
Alright--

58
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,937
Here, sit right here.

59
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,774
Sit right there.
Okay... yeah, here you go.

60
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:10,904
Ok, come on. Stay, stay...
It's your house, it's okay.

61
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,413
Hello, handsome.

62
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,497
- Hi.
- Hi.

63
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:22,582
- How did it go?
- It was great.

64
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:25,502
- You good, you missed me?
- Not a bit, and you?

65
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:28,088
No, didn't think about you none.

66
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,093
I've a little surprise.

67
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:37,139
Yeah... well, I might have a little
surprise for you too.

68
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,264
Come on,
we've some catching up to do.

69
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:39,766
Yeah.

70
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:44,355
Catching up. Catch up!

71
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:01,872
Do you hear something?

72
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,791
That was a branch against
the window.

73
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,676
- Okay, okay... it's alright!
- Parker!

74
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:57,260
- We had an agreement!
- I know, I know...

75
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,763
- Or did you forget?
- No, I didn't forget!

76
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:03,392
No, he was at the train station.
I mean, it just...

77
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,519
Kind of lost. Carl was gonna send him
to the pound tomorrow and I thought...

78
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,648
You just thought you bring him home
and talk me into keeping him, right?

79
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:12,067
No, no, I don't want to keep him.
I don't.

80
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,464
Tomorrow morning I'm
getting up early and find

81
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:14,860
out exactly where he belongs,
okay. I promise.

82
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,947
I promise you, I will do that.

83
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,700
Alright, this was Lucas's stuff.

84
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,786
Okay... okay.

85
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,995
Okay, here we go. Get in there.

86
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,837
Now look, a lot of good stuffs here.

87
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:36,548
Keeps you warm, you get that.

88
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,302
This is pretty cool.

89
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:43,682
You like this?
Yep, this was Luke's favorite.

90
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,477
Here's your water.

91
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,774
Seems strange. You could tell, huh.
Could ya?

92
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:57,320
Okay, buddy.

93
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,326
That's better.

94
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:07,538
Good night, buddy.

95
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:21,510
<i>You know, you're the one who's
should be in the doghouse.</i>

96
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:24,639
<i>I promise,
I won't bite your finger.</i>

97
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,482
Puppy, puppy!

98
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:38,402
Here, hey... puppy.
Puppy, puppy... come on.

99
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:42,697
That's good... ohh.
Good puppy.

100
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,034
Dad, I love him.

101
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,120
Does he have a name yet?

102
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,123
Yes, he does. <i>Temporary guest!</i>

103
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,798
You'll have to keep him.
Don't the house

104
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,467
feel so empty since Lucas been gone.

105
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:05,721
Ask your mother.

106
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:07,181
Mom!

107
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:08,099
Yeah?

108
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:09,767
Could you come here, please?

109
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,937
Look, he even likes your music.

110
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:16,544
Really? I can't believe it,
he's a wonder dog.

111
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:19,150
I absolutely have to keep this.

112
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,403
No more dog.
Don't encourage him.

113
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:23,447
I won't!

114
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:24,697
You're so mean.

115
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:27,826
Dad, he's gonna jump out
of it, here.

116
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,495
Oh yeah, that's better.

117
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:34,917
You know what, bud?

118
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:40,004
Well, that's good.
I like it, great!

119
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,716
So, you saw Michael last night?

120
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:48,764
Yeah, we drove over to the look-out.
Looks common but it's beautiful.

121
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:50,849
Very romantic.

122
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,518
It was.

123
00:11:58,565 --> 00:11:59,607
Are you the...

124
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:00,650
Can I help you, pop?

125
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,070
Yeah... yeah, I just found this little
tyke at the station last night.

126
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,489
Can you board him till
we find his owner?

127
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,575
Board him?
We can't board him.

128
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:09,659
This isn't a boarding service,
it's a pound, pal!

129
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:14,456
Look, I just found him,
what am I going to do with him?

130
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,293
Listen...

131
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,423
He's cute. That'll help with
the adoption but...

132
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:26,551
We give them two weeks.

133
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,096
Two weeks?

134
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:32,599
We're packed!

135
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,144
Excuse me.

136
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,484
I'll call you next week then,
alright... bye-bye.

137
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:45,320
- Morning Mary Anne.
- How are you doing, Parker?

138
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,947
I'm doing great. I was wondering
if I could ask you for a favor?

139
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,408
Sure... anything.

140
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:59,375
Oh... look at this!

141
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,671
Hey little one. Hello... hello.

142
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:06,883
Oh... oh, he's gorgeous.
Where did you comes from?

143
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,969
Well, he was wandering
around the station last night.

144
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,053
- Hi, sweetheart.
- I don't know, it's pretty strange.

145
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,847
Really? He is adorable!

146
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:15,933
I just want to put that up.

147
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,019
- Okay, fine... fine!
- Window? - Yep, and over there.

148
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,418
And anyone of those.

149
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,815
Parker, this dog is just fabulous!

150
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,692
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

151
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:26,568
What, the puppy?

152
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,236
Fine young puppy like that.

153
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:31,073
What do you think, Anthonio?
New room-mate?

154
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:33,576
Oh no, Anthonio!

155
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:38,663
Sit quietly.

156
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,092
Good morning, Mr. Professor.

157
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,135
Jess!

158
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:53,700
Sugar, 2 creams coming up.

159
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,264
- Er-huh.
- Hey, what've you got there?

160
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,767
A new friend here, you want a dog?

161
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,518
I prefer cash.

162
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:02,020
It'll be a great guard dog for ya.
Look at it.

163
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,399
Guard dog to guard the hot-dogs?
I don't think so.

164
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,193
Ha-ha, I don't think so either.

165
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:11,822
- Sorry about that.
- Why you want a dog, eh?

166
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:13,950
Everyday you'll have to walk him,

167
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,034
feed him, clean him,
pick up the food...

168
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,495
How many of these gonna help him?

169
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,663
On the house.

170
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,039
Why trouble?

171
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,125
Yeah, you're right.
Thank you, Jess.

172
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,168
My pleasure.

173
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:26,879
Hey, any news?

174
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,215
No, nobody came, nobody show up,
nobody call.

175
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:30,716
Nobody?

176
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:33,927
Strange, really strange.

177
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:36,971
Just one second.

178
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:42,269
Cate made up some flyers.
Put that up for me.

179
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,270
Come on!

180
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,440
Alright, I'll put them up for you.

181
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,899
What a samaritan you are.

182
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:48,942
I know... I know.

183
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,696
He really likes being in the bag.

184
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:55,948
Professor, no dog's on the train.

185
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,534
- No dog's on the train
- Right!

186
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:04,225
Okay, hold on a second.
Let me show you something.

187
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,164
We skipped the...
repeated the first section,

188
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,104
go directly to the lyrical section.

189
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,147
Let's try that.

190
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:10,190
Okay.

191
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,567
It just mean you've got to
build up quicker.

192
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,652
And then when you, when we
get to the lyrical section, just...

193
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:17,488
Deep breath, deep breath.

194
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,062
Hello.

195
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:02,325
That's great.

196
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,615
Do you want a puppy?
You want a puppy

197
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,627
- Well, let's go again.
- Yes, from the start.

198
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,923
This was the only thing
left on the crate.

199
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:22,135
<i>Yamanashi,</i> it's all I can read.

200
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:25,181
- Where is that?
- It's a part of central Japan.

201
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,852
- No ordinary dog, Parker.
- I know.

202
00:17:29,852 --> 00:17:33,521
It's a Akita. Akita, as you say.

203
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,232
- A very special breed.
- Yeah?

204
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:41,739
- And what's that?
- Hachi.

205
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:44,991
- What? - Japanese, for 8,
a number of good fortune.

206
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:48,828
Good fortune, very nice.

207
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:53,208
Hachi ... Hachi, it's good name.
I like that.

208
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,294
He might have been born
the eighth in the litter.

209
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:59,798
Spiritual significant in a 8, reaches
up to heaven comes down to earth.

210
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,011
So, will you take him?
You want him?

211
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:08,891
Me? No, I think he made his choice.

212
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:10,976
Meaning what?

213
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:14,229
Well, meaning he's your problem,
not mine brother.

214
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:16,940
You are not a problem, right?

215
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,279
Well, wether you found
him or he found you,

216
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,034
who's to say. It's meant to be.

217
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:32,247
It's also said that the <i>Shoguns</i> breed
these Akita for combat and hunting.

218
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:36,750
I guess in a way,
they're a kind of dog royalty.

219
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,964
Did Ken give you any ideas where
you can find this royal dog a home?

220
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,972
I put up 10 flyers already. You
know, someone gonna claim Hachi.

221
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,099
Who's Hachi?

222
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:56,895
This... It was what on his collar,
there's this symbol.

223
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,565
You named him?

224
00:18:58,565 --> 00:18:59,816
- No, I didn't...
- Parker, do you wanna keep...

225
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,608
- ...keep him?
- No, I do have...

226
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,903
I don't want to keep him.
I just...

227
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:05,654
Admit it! You do....
you want to keep it.

228
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:07,740
- I wasn't even thinking about it.
- Yes!

229
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,160
Hachi?

230
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:13,788
Where did you go?

231
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,292
Oh no...

232
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:22,672
Oh god... Parker,
that's months of hard work.

233
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:23,506
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

234
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:25,215
I want him to stay out
there all night long.

235
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:26,071
Do not let him get back in here,
you hear me?

236
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:26,925
Yes... yes, I hear you.

237
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:28,510
- End of discussion!
- I hear you!

238
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,638
I hear you.
I heard you alright now.

239
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:42,150
<i>- It's two months of work!
- Believe me, I'm sorry.</i>

240
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,652
<i>The work is important not only for me,
it is important for the city!</i>

241
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:45,694
<i>For...</i>

242
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,989
<i>...4 months of work.</i>

243
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,617
<i>No, you do not care what I do.
Yes, you just spit on it!</i>

244
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:54,578
<i>Cate, that's not true.</i>

245
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:56,454
<i>Calm down!</i>

246
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,049
Hachi!

247
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:13,055
Come on, buddy. Come on.

248
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,641
Yeah, come on inside.

249
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:18,477
And I'll take these too.

250
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:34,951
Okay...

251
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:38,288
...found you here.

252
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:43,085
Yeah, here you are.

253
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:49,424
Your blood line goes back at least
4000 years, maybe much more.

254
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,679
Yeah?
What else we've got here?

255
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,519
Look at that.

256
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:09,736
It's said the first partnership
between man and animal is with you.

257
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,073
Do you knew about that?
You knew that already?

258
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:15,491
You did, didn't you?
Yeah, you did.

259
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:19,121
There you are.

260
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,625
Let's see, settle you down now.

261
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,173
This isn't too bad.

262
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:34,260
Alright, stay there.
Stay there now, okay.

263
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,398
Sit quietly. Now...

264
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:54,280
<i>... no idea that Stan was inside,
so they... lean out there.</i>

265
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,845
<i>... out there and shoot the
ball into the right field,</i>

266
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:57,409
<i>which's what they did in game 2.</i>

267
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:03,748
All right there,
just step a little bit closer.

268
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:06,250
<i>... bad. Still one point in the lead</i>

269
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:14,092
Catch!

270
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:16,803
Come on.

271
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:52,963
Forgive me, please.

272
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:55,048
Don't move...

273
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:57,676
- I was just coming up.
- Yeah, yeah... sure.

274
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,434
Just one night.
One night only, okay?

275
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,229
Be a good boy.

276
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:12,400
Stay there, alright. You will be fine.

277
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:20,199
I can't believe it.
He loves the <i>Yankees.</i>

278
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,659
No.

279
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,952
- Yeah, honestly.
- Really?

280
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:26,372
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

281
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,457
Alright... Hachi,
this is what we gonna do.

282
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,750
This is ball. Ball.

283
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,878
Throw, you go get it.
You bring it back, okay?

284
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:35,756
Okay, you ready?

285
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,675
Go get it! Go get it!

286
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:41,886
No, no, no, the ball.

287
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:45,140
Hachi, Hachi! Hachi--
Hey, Hachi!

288
00:23:45,986 --> 00:23:46,586
Hachi--

289
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,144
I'll throw it, you bring it, okay?
Good!

290
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:52,940
Go get it!

291
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:58,069
Hachi, no, no, no.
Get the ball!

292
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:01,699
Hachi, come here.
Hachi, come here!

293
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:06,286
Go get it. Wait... wait.
Hachi... Hachi.

294
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:09,748
Come on, this ball.
See this ball, come here.

295
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,919
Come here, Hachi. Hachi, come here.
You can do this. I know you can.

296
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,547
I just think that you're being
a little tough about that dog.

297
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:19,549
That dog's in a fix and dad just
trying to do the right thing.

298
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:22,885
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>

299
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:23,845
Mom!

300
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:28,432
<i>Ball, ball, ball, ball!
Get the ball!</i>

301
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:30,184
Hey, come on.

302
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,816
He has lost it.

303
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:41,028
Hello?

304
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:45,116
Oh, the puppy flyer, yes?
Are you the dog's owner?

305
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,226
No, no one comes forward yet.

306
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,624
We just want to make sure
the dog has a good home.

307
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:56,086
Could I get your number?

308
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:57,836
I'm sure my husband
would want to call you.

309
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,048
One second, I need to find a pen,
hold on.

310
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,159
Hello.

311
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,163
The dog's already been taken.

312
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,170
I'm really sorry.

313
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:08,782
Ow! No, no, no, Hachi!

314
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,867
Hachi Hachi Hachi Hachi!

315
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,248
Come on! Take it in. Take it in!

316
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:19,125
No, you can't go. Can't go.
Gotta work.

317
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,420
See you back here tonight, bye.

318
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:00,834
Good morning, Professor.
You are late today.

319
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,171
- I'm already working.
- One sugar, two creams.

<i>Last call for Amtrak Express. Final

Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:29,070
Hachi!

323
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:34,826
What're you doing here? What are
you doing? What're you doing.

324
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:37,328
You gotta go home, okay.
Go... No!

325
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:39,080
Yes, I know. Go, go home,
go on.

326
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,834
Go home! Go on!
I gotta get on the train. Go... go!

327
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:44,752
Okay, come on... gotta go.
Come on!

328
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:46,922
Ho-oh... Professor, you want
me to hold him?

329
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:47,963
Yeah... could you?

330
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:49,007

331
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,049
Thanks.

Go home... go home, okay.
Go... go on, gotta go home.

333

Hey Chuck, hold that up for
a moment, alright.

Go home! Go home!
Go, go, go, go... go on home.

00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:07,067
You really got him train, doesn't it?

337
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,609

Okay.

- Okay, thanks. Yeah, yeah.
- Are you sure?

342
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,833
- Alright, let her go.
- Let her go!

343
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,544
You want me to call you a cab?

344
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:30,089
No, I'll walk him home.
It's all right.

345
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:40,933
Oh, God.

346
00:28:46,564 --> 00:28:49,692
Parker? I thought you left for work.

347
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:52,319
- I didn't go.
- You're gardening now?

348
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,404
He ran out, missed the train.

349
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:58,076
Don't say it.
I know what you're going to say.

350
00:28:58,076 --> 00:28:59,682
No, let me do this.
You're gonna get filthy.

351
00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:01,287
I'll fill it, get the next train.

352
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:03,538
- Okay.
- Thanks!

353
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,877
And you - you stay.

354
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:11,047
- He will.
- See you tonight.

355
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,636
Here's your treat!

356
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,512
Here's your treat!

357
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:09,563
Alright, okay... just one more.
Just one more, that's it.

358
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:10,605
Hold on! Hold on!

359
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:19,155
Well... you're okay?

360
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:23,326
Alright, alright... this's the last.

361
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:26,954
Here you go. Good boy, Hachi!

362
00:30:34,796 --> 00:30:37,173
Okay, one last one.

363
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,926
Take it.

364
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:01,071
That's great... that's really great
everybody. I'm proud of ya.

365
00:31:01,698 --> 00:31:04,617
<i>- Finally.
- And the ending to be repeated.</i>

366
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,702
- Sorry, I'm running late.
- No problem.

367
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:08,872
- Off the hook?
<i>- Yeah!</i>

368
00:31:08,872 --> 00:31:09,914
Good, thank you.

369
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:49,746
Hey, Hachi!
What are you doing here?

370
00:31:49,746 --> 00:31:51,623
<i>Sugar in your drink.</i>

371
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,696
- Chuck.
- Good bye.

372
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,376
Hey... hey Hachi.

373
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:42,506
What're you doing here?

374
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:44,592
Bedridge Station!

375
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,138
Yes, yes, ma'am,
we've got one at 7:30.

376
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:55,144
He's been here all day?

377
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:57,229
No... no, he's just rode up 2 minutes
ago. He went right there.

378
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:59,606
You're kidding. You seen Cate?

379
00:33:00,023 --> 00:33:01,400
I haven't seen her.

380
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,693
Okay.

381
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:06,904
Ok... come on.
Guess we'll go home.

382
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,992
That son of a gun.

383
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:16,707
Come on, come on, boy.
Come on... come on.

384
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,251
Mom!

385
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:22,336
Yeah sweetie, I'm in here.

386
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,590
- Hey... hi!
- Hi!

387
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,259
- I got the chips.
- Oh, thanks.

388
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:28,801
 Hi...Mrs. Wilson, good to see you.

389
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,887
Oh, Michael, nice to see you!
Call me Cate.

390
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:32,930
Ok. Thank you... thank you.

391
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,641
Everything looks delicious.

392
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:36,934
- It's a great spread.
- Why don't you take this to dad?

393
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:38,519
- You sure?
- Yeah, he's out back.

394
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,063
Okay, the grill's ready?

395
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:42,273
It's getting there, yeah.
Yeah, nice to see you.

396
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,317
Nice to meet you.

397
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:45,402
- Cut? And where is...
- Yeah, that would be great, honey.

398
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:51,032
You know, I actually took
the dialog when I was a kid.

399
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:52,075
You do?

400
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:54,869
Yeah, when I was nine
or ten years old.

401
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:58,330
I had to stop because my brother
slammed my fingers in the car door.

402
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,751
I mean he always said that
it was an accident but

403
00:34:01,752 --> 00:34:03,836
after that, I don't know...
I stopped practising.

404
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:07,382
I wish I didn't though cause
I really loved music,

405
00:34:07,382 --> 00:34:11,887
and I've so much respect for
musicians and people playing...

406
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:14,264
Michael, do you love my daughter?

407
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,851
Yes, sir... Yes, I do.

408
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,458
You know... that's good.
Cause that's what

409
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,065
you want to remember
on a bad days.

410
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:27,818
Right.

411
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:33,365
Hachi, this is Michael.
<i>Michael, Hachi.</i>

412
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:35,117
Pleased to meet you.

413
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,416
Hachi, hey... you wanna play
a little catch, huh?

414
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,253
Yeah... ready?
Okay, go get the ball.

415
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:49,215
Go get it... there it is.
Go get the ball, right there.

416
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:53,887
Go Hachi, go get it.
Go... go get the ball.

417
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,702
Go get it.

418
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:57,693
Micheal, you want to get
that ball back,

419
00:34:57,693 --> 00:34:58,682
you gonna have to get it yourself.
Hachi doesn't fetch.

420
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,893
He doesn't do it!?

421
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:04,438
Okay!

422
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,567
Are you alright... are you okay?

423
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:08,608
- All is good.
- Honey, are you okay?

424
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,652
Honey, are you okay?

425
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:10,695
Keep playing.

426
00:35:10,695 --> 00:35:11,737
- Totally, I'm gonna get the ball.
- Are you sure?

427
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:12,780
Okay!

428
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,992
I'm good. Look at that.

429
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:18,702
- Everything okay?
- Don't let me distrupt the game.

430
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:19,744
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:26,626
Look, I'll throw the ball,
just one foot. Go get it, okay?

432
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:29,963
Really, if I... even if I just tossed
it right here, he's not gonna get it?

433
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:49,817
Argh!

434
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:52,945
Ball?

435
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,739
Fetch, right. I throw it,
he brings it back. He won't do it.

436
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,824
Not Akita, Parker.

437
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,119
They have something
against fetching?

438
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,454
No, if you wants a dog
that fetches,

439
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:04,789
you get a collie,
you get a sprinter-spaniel.

440
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,666
Alright, Hachi fine with me.
I'm okay.

441
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,628
Well good, because Akita's
are not into people pleasing.

442
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,088
What are they up to?

443
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:15,634
It comes with the training because
of your special connection.

444
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:19,596
Hey buddy, go get that ball.
Why would you do that?

445
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:23,976
Well, for fun. For a cookies.

446
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,061
Because it made me happy, basically.

447
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:30,148
They can't be bought.
They're Japanese not Americans.

448
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,692
- Yeah, American...
- I know.

449
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:36,697
Well, if he's gonna fetch, it'll
be for a very special reason.

450
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:40,659
I'll find a reason.

451
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,746
No, no, no, no...
Hac, come on.

452
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:47,039
You can't go. I'm sorry.
You can't go, come on.

453
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:52,045
No, stay.

454
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,349
Okay! Come on... come on.

455
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,391
It's alright... come on.

456
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,121
Come on. Good boy.

457
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:12,489
Hey...Hac Hac Hac Hac!
Come on, come on!

458
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:19,735
Hey...Hac--
Hey...

459
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,208
Let's go!
Come on. Come here.

460
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,206
- Good morning, Milton.
- Good morning.

461
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:29,248
How're you doing today?

462
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,668
- Myra.
- Morning Parker.

463
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,670
Stayed out of the sun.

464
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,175
Careful.

465
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:45,994
Good morning, Mr. Professor.

466
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,391
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning, Parker!

467
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,476
He won't bite, eh?

468
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,563
Oh no, he's doing really good.

469
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,605
Come on, boy!

470
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,545
Alright, I want you to go
straight home.

471
00:37:55,547 --> 00:37:57,943
Go straight home,
you understand me?

472
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,280
I'll see you here tonight.
So go ahead... go on home.

473
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,117
Good boy. Good boy!

474
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,293
- Great day Carl, isn't it?
- Have a good one, professor.

475
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,637
Hachi!

476
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:30,559
There... yeah, sh-sh-sh ...
Don't tell Milton, okay?

477
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,427
Hey... Hachi.

478
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:10,846
Oh, what a good boy.

479
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,047
You've been waiting for me all
day and thinking...

480
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,402
<i>Oh, how good I am, how good I am!</i>

481
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,951
Hey, Hac!

482
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,293
More champagne!
Bring more champagne.

483
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,672
I could, well... I don't know.

484
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:42,713
Should be in the kitchen.

485
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,550
<i>Seems like no one else at
the wedding other than us.</i>

486
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:48,971
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

487
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,436
You love the snow, huh?

488
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,114
Let's take a walk, you and me.

489
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,824
Only the two of us, let's go.

490
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,827
Tell me about something.

491
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,434
Hachi!

492
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,362
That's great, Jake.

493
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,405
<i>Thanks.</i>

494
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,449
Cate! Have you seen Hachi?
He wasn't at the station.

495
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,411
No, I haven't seen him since
this morning.

496
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,454
- Hmm.
- Here!

497
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,668
Look at her.

498
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:07,715
Can you believe they had
her cover for 30 years?

499
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,927
It's beautiful.

500
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,137
Yes, yes.

501
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:19,059
- I'm falling behind schedule.
- Aww, you'll catch up.

502
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,771
Just think about opening night,
that will freak you out?

503
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:27,402
The young soloist step down stage
sings from La Bohème.

504
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:31,635
And then dance, of course.
Following that,

505
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:35,867
rock, rap, hip-hop, jazz and...
Hamlet!

506
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:41,858
Then, of course, the entire town is
going to rise up, standing ovation,

507
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,126
the whole place going crazy.

508
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:45,608
Mayor seize you down,
he pulls you up on stage,

509
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:48,672
put you center stage and thank
you for making it all possible.

510
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,715
Yeah?

511
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,757
Yeah!

512
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:52,635
I like it.

513
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,514
Hachi!

514
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,351
Come on boy.

515
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,233
Hachi?

516
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:14,114
Hachi!

517
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,911
What are you doing?

518
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:28,211
Alright!

519
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:34,885
Stay, stay Hachi.

520
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,514
Sh-sh-sh, don't bother it.

521
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:45,394
Okay, go on, go away.
Go on, get out!

522
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:53,860
Get... get, get out of here.
Get out! Get out!

523
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:11,170
Well, okay.

524
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:14,007
Come on... come on.

525
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:16,710
Wooh!

526
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:19,945
Ugh!

527
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,983
Parker!

528
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,958
We got skunk!

529
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,213
You want to come in with us?

530
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,880
No, I'm going to pass.

531
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:58,425
Well, okay.

532
00:44:03,514 --> 00:44:05,724
Better open the window
before you go to sleep.

533
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:09,061
You really think we smell
that bad?

534
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:13,733
Perhaps you're right.

535
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:20,822
Mom!

536
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,159
Oh, hi honey.

537
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,661
What's up?

538
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,041
Hey, can I tell you something?

539
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:33,878
Guess what?

540
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:34,920
What?

541
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,880
- Okay, wait... that's right.
- What?

542
00:44:40,592 --> 00:44:42,637
See anything different?

543
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:44,387
No.

544
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:45,431
Yes!

545
00:44:46,974 --> 00:44:49,601
Oh... it's so sweet.

546
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:52,855
Oh, it's so wonderful!

547
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:55,483
I've to call grandma right away.

548
00:44:56,358 --> 00:44:57,443
Where is dad?

549
00:44:57,443 --> 00:44:59,110
Out there, as usual.

550
00:45:00,695 --> 00:45:01,780
Daddy!

551
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:06,159
Dad!

552
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:11,164
Dad, what're you doing?

553
00:45:11,164 --> 00:45:15,543
It's a full body massage,
following the book, see it?

554
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:17,338
You're gonna be a grandfather.

555
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:18,588
You gotta get really deep
down into the muscle...

556
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:20,673
Dad, dad!

557
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,971
Micheal and I are having a baby.
I am pregnant.

558
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:28,389
You...

559
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:33,603
Really?

560
00:45:33,603 --> 00:45:34,646
Yes.

561
00:45:35,063 --> 00:45:36,398
You're having a baby?

562
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,447
- I'm going to be a grandpa.
- Yes.

563
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:48,284
Cathy, I can't believe this!

564
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:52,193
This is terrific news.
I'm so happy for you.

565
00:45:53,623 --> 00:45:55,166
Hi sweetie.

566
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,960
- Mom.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

567
00:45:58,295 --> 00:45:59,545
Oh, what you got?

568
00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:01,422
All kinds of healthy things for you.

569
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:05,719
Fresh vegetables, raspberries,
pita with cholesterol-less sprouts...

570
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:08,681
You know, when I was carrying you,

571
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:10,161
I was sending out your
father for pizza with red pepper

572
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:11,641
and double anchovies for
a week straight.

573
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:13,643
He couldn't even watch when I eat it.

574
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:18,231
You and dad have been
together for 25 years.

575
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:20,525
We've been longer together
than we've been apart.

576
00:46:20,525 --> 00:46:21,568
Wow.

577
00:46:25,405 --> 00:46:29,867
Dad said after your first date,
by the time he got back...

578
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:33,246
to the car, he miss you so much,
he went back for you.

579
00:46:33,954 --> 00:46:36,458
I know, I was watching
from the window.

580
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,648
And when I saw him come
up the walk again,

581
00:46:39,648 --> 00:46:42,213
I almost ran out the door
and jumps into his arm.

582
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,173
- Should have.
- I know.

583
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:46,259
But I always stop and
think too much.

584
00:46:46,259 --> 00:46:48,677
That's true... you do.

585
00:46:48,677 --> 00:46:50,012
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

586
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:51,056
Okay!

587
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:55,434
Hey, Hachi!
Come on... Hachi, come on.

588
00:46:56,686 --> 00:46:58,146
He always greets him there?

589
00:46:58,146 --> 00:46:59,188
Look.

590
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:04,610
- Isn't it strange?
- Come on, let's go home.

591
00:47:06,905 --> 00:47:08,072
Hey, Mr. Professor.

592
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:09,532
Good night, Parker!

593
00:47:09,532 --> 00:47:10,574
Good night, Mary Anne.

594
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:11,826
How do you taught your
dog to do that?

595
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:13,911
That's amazing, everyday.

596
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,715
Parker!

597
00:47:32,472 --> 00:47:33,722
Parker!

598
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,867
You're all dress.

599
00:47:56,954 --> 00:48:01,375
Well, that might be something
I'll be able to do without.

600
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,503
Thank you.

601
00:48:06,338 --> 00:48:08,965
Anything else you required, madam?

602
00:48:10,342 --> 00:48:12,302
It depends on what you've got.

603
00:48:14,304 --> 00:48:15,639
Everything.

604
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:16,681
Everything?

605
00:48:28,902 --> 00:48:31,280
Yeah... everything.

606
00:48:44,918 --> 00:48:48,130
You've to put up with a lot,
I know that.

607
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:52,009
I don't remember ever
thanking you.

608
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:02,143
You know how much I love you.

609
00:49:05,355 --> 00:49:07,356
And I love you.

610
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:09,943
Strange.

611
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:16,617
Especially when you do smell
like a dog or a skunk.

612
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:21,538
That doesn't happen very often,
actually you should worried about...

613
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,831
It happens, just don't know when.

614
00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:41,849
- I love you. Call you later.
- And I love you too, bye-bye.

615
00:49:45,936 --> 00:49:48,106
Okay, Hachi... come on.

616
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:54,487
Hachi... come on.

617
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:59,701
Come on now, what's wrong
with you... come on.

618
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:03,538
What's it?

619
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,628
Come here Come here!
Come here...

620
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,050
Come here, what's with you?
Come here now, you've got a problem?

621
00:50:18,344 --> 00:50:21,597
Alright, what's going on?

622
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:27,103
Alright... okay.
Alright now, okay.

623
00:50:27,226 --> 00:50:28,927
Come on! Come on!

624
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:33,985
What's wrong with him?

625
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:35,652
I don't know.

626
00:50:35,652 --> 00:50:38,699
Hachi, you wanna come because
I've got to go, it's a work day.

627
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:40,487
Come on, buddy.
Come on!

628
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:43,494
I've got to go.

629
00:50:44,202 --> 00:50:47,039
- Love you, honey.
- Love you too. See you tonight.

630
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,668
Last chance.

631
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,213
Bye!

632
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,452
- Hi, Mary Anne.
- Hey Jess, how're you?

633
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:28,204
- I already've your coffee and donuts.
- Oh yeah, thank you. - Alright.

634
00:51:41,885 --> 00:51:43,344
Where's Hachi?

635
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:53,646
Hey, Hachi.

636
00:51:53,646 --> 00:51:56,065
Ah, here he comes.

637
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:59,610
Oh, I'm happy to see you.

638
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,697
Why did you bring the ball for?

639
00:52:01,697 --> 00:52:03,782
<i>Why you giving me the ball?</i>

640
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:06,702
You want to play catch?
Here, here... here.

641
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:07,369
Wait... wait!

642
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:10,038
Here boy. Go get it!

643
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:13,250
Go get it. Go get it!

644
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:16,378
Quite good. Now, bring it back.

645
00:52:17,336 --> 00:52:20,757
Oh... that's it.
That's what I wanted.

646
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:23,802
Try another one. Big one.
Big long one.

647
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:27,021
Okay, go get it. Go on!

648
00:52:27,556 --> 00:52:31,934
Good boy!
Oh yeah, now bring it back.

649
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,211
Okay, come on... come on.
Come on!

650
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:37,773
Come on. Oh, what a good boy.
What a good boy.

651
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:41,027
Aren't you the good boy?
You see that.

652
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:42,070
Hmm.

653
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,824
Threw the ball, he brought it back.
First time he fetch. A real fetch.

654
00:52:45,824 --> 00:52:48,201
Congratulations.

655
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:50,911
Thanks you. Good boy!

656
00:52:50,911 --> 00:52:54,456
Okay, gotta go work.
Come on, take the ball.

657
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:58,003
First time!

658
00:52:58,003 --> 00:52:59,795
Heh, first time!

659
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:04,384
<i>No... wait, Mr. Professor! Wait!
I'll make you a coffee right now.</i>

660
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:05,427
Alright.

661
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:06,469
Sorry, I'm late today.

662
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:08,032
Did you see what he did?

663
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:09,597
I threw the ball, he brought it back.
It was a fetch.

664
00:53:09,597 --> 00:53:11,056
No, no, no.

665
00:53:11,056 --> 00:53:13,143
You keep the ball.

666
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:16,146
Do you want me to have that?
I can't play now.

667
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:18,356
I've got to go to work.
I've got to go to work.

668
00:53:18,356 --> 00:53:20,525
I'll take the ball, alright.

669
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:22,277
- Okay.
- Here you go.

670
00:53:22,277 --> 00:53:23,945
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

671
00:53:23,945 --> 00:53:26,030
- See you at 5.
- I will be here.

672
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,532
Okay! Go home Hac... go home.

673
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:40,003
Alright... come here!
Come here... come here.

674
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:42,922
Okay, it's alright.

675
00:53:43,463 --> 00:53:48,135
See you at 5 o' clock, alright.
Here you go. Hey, go home, go on.

676
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,112
You think it was better that time?

677
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:49,153
<i>Laughter.</i>

678
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:52,282
<i>(Inaudible)</i>

679
00:54:52,282 --> 00:54:58,204
Alright, you remember we were
talking about John Philip Sousa,

680
00:54:58,204 --> 00:55:02,083
a great <i>March</i> composer
at the turn of the century?

681
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:08,340
He... very famous man but he
had a huge thing about...

682
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,467
... recorded music. He never
allowed his music to be recorded.

683
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:14,012
Even when Thomas Edison
came to him

684
00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:16,556
with his brand new invention
- the phonograph.

685
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:20,581
But Edison's didn't care, he
went ahead and did it anyhow.

686
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,981
He secretly recorded his
marching band in a parade.

687
00:55:25,023 --> 00:55:27,400
I guess makes it the very
first boot-leg.

688
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,242
So what do you think about that?
Do you think Sousa was right?

689
00:55:35,242 --> 00:55:37,161
Do you think it's okay now?

690
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:39,079
What about today's performance,
will you be able to just walk up...

691
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:40,478
to the middle of the stage,

692
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:45,876
plug in your CD player to a <i>Marshall
Stack</i> and that's it, good enough?

693
00:55:46,795 --> 00:55:48,922
I don't know.

694
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:51,342
I am a lot older than you but

695
00:55:51,344 --> 00:55:56,721
I tend to think that
there's an element of music...

696
00:55:56,721 --> 00:56:00,286
... that cannot be capture.
Life cannot be capture.

697
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:01,851
The human heart cannot
be captured.

698
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:05,188
The moment of creation
itself is fleeting.

699
00:56:39,389 --> 00:56:41,474
<i>Oh my God!</i>

700
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:43,434
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

701
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,519
<i>It looks like a heart attack.</i>

702
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:56,072
Hey Hachi... how're you doing?

703
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:58,865
Hey Hachi.

704
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:02,954
See you tomorrow, Hachi.

705
00:57:45,246 --> 00:57:47,456
Good night, Hachi.

706
00:58:02,762 --> 00:58:04,764
Hey, buddy.

707
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:07,601
You ready to go home?

708
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:10,579
Yeah.

709
00:58:45,597 --> 00:58:47,431
Hey, Hachi.

710
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:50,851
Are you alright?

711
00:59:01,695 --> 00:59:04,824
And that's how he did it?

712
00:59:04,824 --> 00:59:06,909
Sorry, I'm learning.

713
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:19,963
Andy! Time to go... sweetheart.

714
00:59:21,382 --> 00:59:25,177
Good boy. You stay here, okay.
We'll be back.

715
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:57,710
I've said that the soul is
not more than the body.

716
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:01,338
And I have said, that the body
is not more than the soul.

717
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:06,677
And nothing, not God is greater
to one than one self is.

718
01:00:06,677 --> 01:00:09,764
I hear,
behold God in every object

719
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:12,849
that understand God not
in the least.

720
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:17,521
Nor do I understand who's there
can be more wonderful than myself.

721
01:00:17,521 --> 01:00:20,545
In the faces of men and women,

722
01:00:20,545 --> 01:00:23,568
I see God and in my own face
in a glance.

723
01:00:23,568 --> 01:00:26,489
I find letters from God
dropped in the street

724
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,407
and everyone signed by
God's name.

725
01:00:29,407 --> 01:00:32,327
But I leave them where there are

726
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:37,666
for I know that wherever I go,
others will constant comes.

727
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:40,878
Forever and ever.

728
01:01:36,266 --> 01:01:40,646
Look, you don't have
to wait anymore.

729
01:01:42,438 --> 01:01:44,608
He's not coming back.

730
01:01:55,284 --> 01:02:01,166
Alright Hachi,
you do what you've to do.

731
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:48,838
Come on... buddy.
Come on... let's go.

732
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:50,797
Come on boy, come on.

733
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,762
Come on Hachi.
Come on Hachi.

734
01:02:56,764 --> 01:02:59,766
You're gonna be with us now.
Let's go... come on.

735
01:03:00,974 --> 01:03:03,518
Alright, time to go, Ronnie's waiting.
Come on.

736
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,836
Let me get that for you, sweetie.

737
01:03:13,528 --> 01:03:15,572
Come on, Hac, up, up up.
Here we go.

738
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:19,744
What a good boy.
Come on Hachi.

739
01:03:23,976 --> 01:03:25,179
Watch your head.
Watch your head!

740
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:26,742
Good boy!

741
01:04:21,387 --> 01:04:23,681
Hey, there's my guy!
Andy!

742
01:04:23,681 --> 01:04:24,724
- Yeah?
- Hachi!

743
01:04:24,724 --> 01:04:25,768
Hachi!

744
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:28,144
- Andy!
- What, dear?

745
01:04:28,144 --> 01:04:31,731
Hachi! Hachi! Come back here.

746
01:04:33,047 --> 01:04:33,581
Hachi!

747
01:04:35,563 --> 01:04:36,764
Hachi...come on!

748
01:04:40,596 --> 01:04:41,096
<i>Hachi!</i>

749
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:44,789
<i>Hachi!</i>

750
01:06:59,335 --> 01:07:01,588
<i>Inaudible dialog</i>

751
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:04,717
Hey, looks like we got the
first visitor.

752
01:07:04,717 --> 01:07:09,096
Hey there buddy! Come to
welcome us to our new home?

753
01:07:10,222 --> 01:07:12,432
<i>We started from the top,
where almost everything is ready.</i>

754
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:14,309
<i>Yeah, but something
with the basement too?</i>

755
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:16,269
<i>The cellar has long
been ready.</i>

756
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:23,777
<i>Donut with chocolate icing.</i>

757
01:07:23,777 --> 01:07:26,487
<i>No, I don't like chocolate.</i>

758
01:07:26,487 --> 01:07:29,824
Hey Hachi,
what are you doing here?

759
01:07:29,824 --> 01:07:32,452
Look it... look it!

760
01:07:35,831 --> 01:07:38,291
He's staying right in the
same spot.

761
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,295
<i>- I thought he moved away.
- He did.</i>

762
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:46,882
- He looks hungry, huh.
- You're a softie, Jess.

763
01:07:46,882 --> 01:07:48,302
<i>We must give him a little.</i>

764
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:54,068
<i>Hey, Hachi! Want a hotdog, bud?
Come on, boy.</i>

765
01:07:56,862 --> 01:07:57,302
Hachi!

766
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:00,230
<i>Maybe he don't likes your
cooking, Jess.</i>

767
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:03,775
This is Jess special. Come on, lick it.
You'll like it. It's good for you.

768
01:08:10,865 --> 01:08:12,742
Where did he comes from?

769
01:08:12,742 --> 01:08:15,871
Just show up.
Come on boy! Eat it.

770
01:08:15,871 --> 01:08:21,083
Oh... you better be careful. Hachi
got hotdogs in there older than you.

771
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:23,420
Don't listen to them.

772
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:39,476
Hachi.

773
01:08:39,476 --> 01:08:40,770
Oh, God.

774
01:08:40,811 --> 01:08:43,814
Hi! Oh... hi, I was so worried
about you...

775
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:48,194
<i>I need you.</i>

776
01:08:48,194 --> 01:08:50,488
And why does she just
hanging around him for?

777
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:54,449
<i>This the professor's daughter.
He probably lived with them.</i>

778
01:08:54,449 --> 01:08:56,536
<i>And Hachi ran out?</i>

779
01:08:56,536 --> 01:08:57,578
<i>Disappeared?</i>

780
01:08:57,578 --> 01:08:58,954
<i>Oh, dear God...</i>

781
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:01,039
Will you come home with me?

782
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:03,001
Hey, hey, hey, hey, she took it.

783
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:04,042
It's alright. It's okay.

784
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:05,420
It's okay.

785
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:08,516
- Come on, come on
- Let's go, buddy.

786
01:09:09,047 --> 01:09:10,282
Thank you very much.

787
01:09:10,987 --> 01:09:11,686
Thank you!

788
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:21,269
- That's the best stuff.
- Alright, get me a coffee.

789
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:25,230
Jess, come on, pour me a coffee.

790
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:43,039
I think of him too, everyday.

791
01:10:11,402 --> 01:10:12,569
Hey.

792
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:19,243
You know we love you Hachi.
We want you to stay here with us.

793
01:10:22,578 --> 01:10:27,583
If you've to go, that's okay too.

794
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,212
Okay!

795
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:51,774
Bye, Hachi.

796
01:11:03,453 --> 01:11:05,747
Good afternoon, Hachi.

797
01:11:35,944 --> 01:11:42,033
Hey Hachi, here you go.
Don't tell Myra, alright!

798
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:45,994
Good night, Hachi.

799
01:12:10,478 --> 01:12:13,939
<i>- Good morning, Jess.
- Hello, how are you?</i>

800
01:12:13,939 --> 01:12:17,694
<i>- I think a big hot dog and
two donuts. - Okay.</i>

801
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:26,786
<i>Be careful, it's hot.</i>

802
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:34,502
<i>Lucky, let's go!</i>

803
01:12:34,502 --> 01:12:36,878
Come on, sweetie.
Hey, Lucky!

804
01:12:36,878 --> 01:12:40,423
- Your coffee, enjoy your meal.
- Here girl. Come on Lucky, let's go.

805
01:12:47,515 --> 01:12:50,850
- Oh, excuse me, sir. - Uh-hmm?
- That dog out there...

806
01:12:51,268 --> 01:12:52,645
Yeah?

807
01:12:52,645 --> 01:12:55,773
Is that the dog that I've been
hearing so much about?

808
01:12:57,858 --> 01:12:59,734
What's it to you?

809
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:04,532
Oh, I am sorry. I'm Teddy Barnes,
I'm with the Metro <i>The Call.</i>

810
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,993
Yeah, I've been hearing a lot
of talks about him on the train.

811
01:13:08,993 --> 01:13:12,247
I don't know. Sounds like
it could make a good story.

812
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,461
That's Boilils, Carl Boilils.

813
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:20,881
B-o-i-l-i-l-s.

814
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:21,923
- Yes, there's no 'Y' in there.
- Got it.

815
01:13:21,966 --> 01:13:25,051
I'm the one that found him,
handed him over.

816
01:13:25,094 --> 01:13:26,636
Oh yeah?

817
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:31,015
So Carl... where does he live?

818
01:13:31,015 --> 01:13:35,813
Well... we're not really sure.
He comes and goes.

819
01:13:35,813 --> 01:13:38,524
- Nobody bothers him?
- No, we put up with him.

820
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:41,234
He just does what's he is doing.

821
01:13:41,234 --> 01:13:46,239
Mind if I take a picture?
For the newspaper.

822
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,951
Oh, I don't mind,
Hachi don't mind?

823
01:13:48,951 --> 01:13:50,827
Thank you very much.
Very nice... very nice.

824

Er... one without first please.

825
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,667
Not the dog, alright.
Stay there.

826
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,293
Hmm... No, I...

827
01:13:59,962 --> 01:14:02,713
- Oh yeah, alright.
- I appreciated it.

828
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:05,550
That's very kind of you.

829
01:14:06,635 --> 01:14:08,261
Okay, nice and easy.

830
01:14:08,261 --> 01:14:09,720
- Oh yeah!
- Yeah... yeah.

831
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,806
Look there, big smile.

832
01:14:11,806 --> 01:14:14,184
Smile... Aah, that's...

If this keeps up, I've gotta
open a bank account for you.

Don't say I never gave you though.

read the article then?

You saw my name in the article?

857

Twice.

859

No, no, no, please. No money.

Medical expenses...

They get collection,

01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:27,815
Everyday he comes same time,
same place...

866
01:16:27,815 --> 01:16:29,275
... here only.

867
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:30,860
You'll do that for him?

868
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,613
Take care of him?

869
01:16:32,613 --> 01:16:34,198
Of course!

870
01:16:36,074 --> 01:16:40,328
Okay then.
Got to serve some hotdogs.

871
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:41,372
Good to meet you.

872
01:16:41,372 --> 01:16:43,873
Me too.
Thank you very much.

873
01:17:30,587 --> 01:17:36,760
Come on, mister.
Here we go.

874
01:17:40,512 --> 01:17:44,684
Want some more?
Here, take this.

875
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,440
Okay... come on boy, last piece.
Taste good, eh?

876
01:18:01,993 --> 01:18:03,536
<i>This is where you
all brought it?</i>

877
01:18:03,536 --> 01:18:06,663
<i>- Oh, thank you.
- See you tomorrow, Hachi.</i>

878
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,708
<i>Ciao, Hachi!</i>

879
01:18:47,954 --> 01:18:49,539
<i>Thanks.</i>

880
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:04,971
<i>The usual, eh?</i>

881
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:07,557
<i>Why you ever not take
chicken wings?</i>

882
01:19:07,557 --> 01:19:08,600
<i>Hey, this...</i>

883
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,643
<i>Mustard?</i>

884
01:19:10,685 --> 01:19:12,979
Mrs. Wilson, nice to
see you again.

885
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:14,023
Good afternoon.

886
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:18,652
Hey, that's the professor's wife, eh?

887
01:19:29,454 --> 01:19:31,789
<i>Now Showing
The Merchant of Venice</i>

888
01:20:11,162 --> 01:20:15,375
<i>Parker H. Wilson
Loving husband and father</i>

889
01:20:18,712 --> 01:20:20,796
Cate.

890
01:20:24,426 --> 01:20:25,761
Ken...

891
01:20:28,471 --> 01:20:30,556
It's been awhile.

892
01:20:31,182 --> 01:20:33,268
Certainly have.

893
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:47,657
It's been 10 years...
can you believe it.

894
01:21:02,255 --> 01:21:04,047
Hi Hachi!

895
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,681
<i>Good day, Hachi.</i>

896
01:21:26,237 --> 01:21:28,636
<i>Coffee without sugar, and don't
put mustard in the hot dog.</i>

897
01:21:28,636 --> 01:21:31,033
<i>Ketchup is the best.</i>

898
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:33,118
<i>Alright, have a good one.</i>

899
01:21:56,809 --> 01:21:58,560
Hachi?

900
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:07,235
Hachi...

901
01:22:11,073 --> 01:22:14,201
Oh, you poor thing,
you're still waiting.

902
01:22:25,171 --> 01:22:27,463
Good boy.

903
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:32,344
Hachi!

904
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:51,029
If it's alright, could I wait with
you for the next train?

905
01:22:53,823 --> 01:22:55,408
Yeah?

906
01:22:56,952 --> 01:22:59,037
Thanks.

907
01:23:07,796 --> 01:23:09,463
Oh, Hachi...

908
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:23,311
<i>You're so tiny.</i>

909
01:23:23,353 --> 01:23:24,395
<i>You like that mom?</i>

910
01:23:24,395 --> 01:23:25,439
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

911
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:27,399
Let's go somewhere.

912
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:28,442
Oh, that's me.

913
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:31,466
I know, I remember.

914
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:34,488
I remember I was there that day
when the picture was taken.

915
01:23:35,448 --> 01:23:37,324
- He is so excited.
- Hmm!

916
01:23:38,993 --> 01:23:40,953
Oh, he's at the wedding.

917
01:23:40,953 --> 01:23:45,958
Yeah, he's right there.
Right there.

918
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:48,377
Where did grandpa find Hachi?

919
01:23:49,503 --> 01:23:53,466
<i>Ronnie, actually Hachi found
your grandfather.</i>

920
01:23:53,466 --> 01:23:55,342
<i>How?</i>

921
01:23:55,342 --> 01:24:00,055
<i>One night, your grandfather
was coming back from a trip.</i>

922
01:24:01,599 --> 01:24:06,604
<i>Got out of the train station
and on the platform...</i>

923
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:02,051
Hey, wake up.

924
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:04,555
Hey, boy.

925
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:09,434
Hey, come on. Let's go!

926
01:26:37,796 --> 01:26:39,463
Hachi!

927
01:26:39,463 --> 01:26:41,757
Hey boy!

928
01:27:24,091 --> 01:27:29,096
<i>I never met my grandfather.
He died when I was just a baby.</i>

929
01:27:29,137 --> 01:27:35,395
But when I hear about him and Hachi,
I feel like I know him.

930
01:27:35,395 --> 01:27:39,045
<i>They taught me the
meaning of loyalty,</i>

931
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:42,694
<i>and you should never forget
anyone that you love.</i>

932
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:47,489
And that's why Hachi will
forever be my hero.

933
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:03,547
Oh, he's happy to see somebody.

934
01:28:05,925 --> 01:28:07,592
Move along.

935
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:13,431
Come on Hachi, let's go!
