1
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,315
One! One!

2
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,567
One, two, one!

3
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,778
One! One!

4
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,614
One, two, one!

5
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,532
Dear Mother:

6
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,244
I hope you are keeping well
and not worrying too much about me.

7
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,289
You mustn't think that any of us
are going to be killed...

8
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:08,169
...for they are collecting such a force
here that an attack would be insane.

9
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,048
The Massachusetts men
passed through here this morning.

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,635
How grand it is to meet the men
from all the states, east and west...

11
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,012
...down here ready
to fight for their country...

12
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,097
...as the old fellows did
in the Revolution.

13
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,852
But this time we must make it
a whole country...

14
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,106
...for all who live here,
so that all can speak.

15
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,735
Before this war began...

16
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,197
...many of my regiment
had never seen a Negro.

17
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,659
Now the roads are choked
with the dispossessed.

18
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:45,039
We fight for men and women
whose poetry is not yet written...

19
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,877
...but which will presently be
as enviable and as renowned as any.

20
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,549
Last night we heard
of yet another defeat.

21
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,592
But we are not disheartened.

22
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,887
I am honored to be part
of such a splendid company.

23
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,641
They have made me captain,
of which I am enormously proud.

24
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,353
You would think it strange to see me
giving orders to a hundred men...

25
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,438
...most of whom are older
than I am.

26
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,526
Thank you for sending
my volume of Emerson.

27
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,237
His words come home to me
like truth.

28
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,450
'A deep man,' he says, 'believes
that the evil eye can wither...

29
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,161
...that the heart's blessing
can heal...

30
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,290
...and that love
can overcome all odds. '

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,752
My dearest love to Father.

32
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,172
Your son, Robert.

33
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,193
Company, forward!

34
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,573
- Charge!
- Fire!

35
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,206
Fire!

36
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,958
Ready, men?

37
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,964
Fire!

38
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,217
- Aim!
- Aim!

39
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,220
- Fire!
- Fire!

40
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,565
Stand. Fire!

41
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,237
Steady, boys!

42
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,620
- Forward!
- Fire!

43
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,002
Fire!

44
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,384
Forward, men! Forward!

45
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,220
For God's sake, come on!

46
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,269
Fire!

47
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,614
Robert, come on!
We must fall back!

48
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,283
No! Forbes!

49
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,286
Forbes!

50
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,893
Charge!

51
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,372
You all right there, captain?

52
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,007
Please! Not my leg!

53
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,676
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!

54
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,636
Stop!

55
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,933
No! Wait!

56
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,478
- No!
- Hold on!

57
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,399
So it's the neck, right, captain?

58
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,902
Well, the surgeons are all busy,
but I'll fix you up.

59
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,111
All right, I'll just-

60
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,946
- Let me know if I hurt you.
- Stop!

61
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,282
Oh, this is nothing.

62
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,119
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?

63
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,788
Well, I heard it from a friend
who's a dispatch rider...

64
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:04,376
...who got it from a friend who's one
of Stanton's clerks in the War Office.

65
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,504
He says Lincoln is gonna issue
an emancipation proclamation.

66
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,507
Gonna free the slaves.

67
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,926
What?

68
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,386
Maybe not in the border states
or something...

69
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,764
...but he's gonna free
some of them, anyway.

70
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,641
- My God.
- Yeah.

71
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,644
Would've done it sooner,
only he was waiting on a big victory...

72
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,604
...which is, I guess, what this is.

73
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,523
Oh, my God!

74
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,526
Please don't cut anymore, please!

75
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,737
Please!

76
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,031
This might hurt you, captain.
I'm sorry.

77
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,866
Thank you.

78
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,814
Dashing.

79
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,758
- Robert.
- Thomas.

80
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,595
Captain Shaw.
I was so proud when I heard.

81
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,974
Well, they had no choice.
All the other officers are dead.

82
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,893
- And Forbes?
- Impossible, as always.

83
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,521
He's around here somewhere.

84
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,731
How about you?

85
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,775
Working for your father,
helping him with the resettlement...

86
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,819
...for the Freedmen's
Relief Association.

87
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,612
There's a shortage of housing.

88
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,865
Robert! Are you all right?

89
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,617
Yes. I'm sorry.

90
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,914
Robert! Darling, there's someone
who wishes to meet you.

91
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,460
General Hunter rounded up
a bunch of slaves from the fields...

92
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,838
...called them "contraband"
and put them in camps like cattle.

93
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,925
Then the War Department decided
to issue them pikes rather than guns.

94
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,553
Of course they deserted.
So would I.

95
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,637
Robert.

96
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,389
Governor, you know my son Robert.

97
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,934
- Yes, good to see you again, Robert.
- Governor Andrew.

98
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,229
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?

99
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,403
Mr. Douglass.

100
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,657
I understand you were at Antietam.

101
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,244
Yes.

102
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,083
A great and a terrible day.

103
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,505
Well, I could use your help, Robert.

104
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,925
The governor is proposing to raise
a regiment of Negro soldiers.

105
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,595
No, no. It was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass and some of us-

106
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,848
We will offer pride and dignity...

107
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,226
...to those who have known
only degradation.

108
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,937
Colored soldiers, Robert.
Just think of it.

109
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,188
Wonderful.

110
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,982
I've submitted your name
to be commissioned colonel...

111
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,444
...of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry.

112
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:28,997
Thank you, governor. That's-
It's a wonderful idea.

113
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,919
Excuse me.

114
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,176
- Well done, Shaw.
- Well done, captain.

115
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,638
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.

116
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,367
What's the matter, chester?
Too much punch?

117
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,541
I mean, I know how much
you'd like to make colonel...

118
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,751
...but a colored regiment?

119
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,758
You know how popular
that would be?

120
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,095
Handing out guns
to a thousand coloreds?

121
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,355
Hey, Robert.

122
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,358
What's wrong?

123
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,782
I'm gonna do it.

124
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,747
You're not serious.

125
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,249
Yeah.

126
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,796
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?

127
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,799
And you?

128
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,724
Can you picture me
in charge of a regiment?

129
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,813
Picture me in charge of anything?

130
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,107
I would be honored to have you.

131
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,822
Well, then you're an idiot.

132
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:31,828
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?

133
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,414
So it seems.

134
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,625
Then I am your first volunteer.

135
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,180
Present arms!

136
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,601
How do we look, colonel?
We gonna whup the Secesh?

137
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,311
Boss, when do we get the blue suit?

138
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,148
- Yeah, the blue suit.
- Yeah.

139
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,782
- Ready to whip them Rebs.
- Ready, colonel!

140
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,868
- When are we gonna get to fight?
- Yeah!

141
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,705
Are we really gonna get to fight
this time?

142
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,969
Attention!

143
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,889
- Morning.
- Morning.

144
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,270
Good morning, gentlemen.

145
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,190
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.

146
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,234
I am your commanding officer.

147
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,074
It is a great pleasure
to see you all here today.

148
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:56,997
It is my hope
that the same courage...

149
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:03,045
...spirit and honor,
which has brought us together...

150
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,714
...will one day restore this Union.

151
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,927
May God bless us all!

152
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,180
Yeah!

153
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,935
Form companies?

154
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,271
We will commence
with forming companies.

155
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,066
Company officers, take charge.

156
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,404
You recruits will report
to your respective officers...

157
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:34,368
...by the letter of your company
in alphabetical order...

158
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:39,122
...which is in the top left-hand corner
of your muster sheet.

159
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,477
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.

160
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,979
Name's Searles. Thomas Searles.

161
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,774
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?

162
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,651
It's a collection of essays actually.

163
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,446
Fourier, Emerson,
all the transcendentalists.

164
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,033
- It got pictures?
- No.

165
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,827
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to.

166
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:17,828
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to...

167
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,911
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to.

168
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,428
Will you look at what's
walking in here! Look at them.

169
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,931
I'd rather have a hog than a nigger.
At least you could eat the hog!

170
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,017
Getting dark mighty early
around here.

171
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,315
Come on! Show us a little dance,
will you, boys?

172
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,419
Sergeant of the guard,
post your sentry.

173
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,296
Yes, sir!

174
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,216
Right there!

175
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,968
Shoulder!

176
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:19,055
Right file, right. March!

177
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,058
Wait, no.
See, that's my space, nigger.

178
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,060
I sleep better close-up on that door.

179
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,774
If you don't mind, I'd prefer a space
with more sufficient reading light.

180
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,234
Oh, I like it when niggers
talk good as white folk.

181
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,615
I'd be happy to teach you.
It would be my pleasure.

182
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,702
Hey, look here, snowflake, I ain't got
nothing to learn from no house nigger.

183
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,830
I am a free man,
as was my father before me.

184
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,165
- Oh, you free, nigger?
- Yes.

185
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,585
Good. Why don't you move
your free black ass before I bust it up?

186
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,213
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.

187
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,757
It's all right.

188
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,092
I'll be fine over here.

189
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
Excuse me.

190
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,017
Wonder when they gonna
give us the blue suit.

191
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,771
Ain't give no blue suit to no black
soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.

192
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,106
Well, we soldiers now.

193
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,111
- Where you from, field hand?
- South Carolina.

194
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,448
South Carolina? Well, you ought
to know better than that, boy.

195
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:23,036
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.

196
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,705
Hey, hey, hey.

197
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,842
What's your name, boy?

198
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,887
I said what's your name, boy?

199
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,099
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?

200
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,142
He's mute.

201
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,272
You mean this child can't talk?

202
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,151
Hey, come over here, hon.

203
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,284
Dummies and field hands.
Ain't that a bitch?

204
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,995
What about you there, buck?
Whereabouts are you from?

205
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,457
I'm from around Tennessee.

206
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,752
Ran away when I 12 years old,
I ain't never looked back.

207
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,171
Wh-? What you doing since then?

208
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,883
I've run for president.

209
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,181
I didn't win though.

210
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,984
Boy.

211
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,743
Come on, give us some food, man.

212
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,633
Major? Forbes?

213
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:00,926
That's you.

214
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,260
- Thomas.
- Hello.

215
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,638
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.

216
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,056
- Charlie.
- Thomas Searles.

217
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,850
- Hello.
- Cabot.

218
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,145
So how was your meal?

219
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,272
The rémoulade was a trifle tart...

220
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,150
...but the soufflé for dessert
more than made up for it.

221
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,778
And your comrades?

222
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,991
Charming. Extraordinary
conversationalists, every one.

223
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,035
Major Forbes.

224
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,245
A word, please.

225
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,957
Oh, excuse me, Thomas.

226
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,254
Yes, Robert?

227
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,257
I won't permit
that kind of fraternization.

228
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,720
- It's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.

229
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,432
You're right, of course.

230
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,477
I've sent for help.

231
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,063
These men need a proper teacher.

232
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,483
For God's sakes, men, you march
like a bunch of crippled old goats!

233
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:02,112
Jesus Christ, we're gonna be here
day and night until we get this right.

234
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,822
One, one!

235
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,365
Company, halt!

236
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,742
About-face!

237
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:12,288
You are ugly Mexican,
African fucking whores!

238
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,166
We're gonna work on this
day and night, gentlemen.

239
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,794
Forward at the half step. March!

240
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,505
One. You half-wit black bastard.

241
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,716
Is it true they cut your balls off
at birth?

242
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,511
I'm gonna work on you, you bastard,
until I get you broken.

243
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,221
Company, halt!

244
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,057
For God's sake, do you not know
your right from your left?

245
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,143
No, no, no, sir.

246
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,313
How many here do not know
right from left?

247
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,901
Jesus, have pity.

248
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,737
This is your front!

249
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,115
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this-

250
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,660
Now you're learning, boyo.

251
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,371
Company, forward, march!

252
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,832
One, one, one.

253
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,000
- Two!
- One!

254
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,084
- Two!
- One!

255
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,080
- Two!
- One!

256
00:22:59,086 --> 00:22:59,836
- Two!
- One.!

257
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,046
- Two!
- One!

258
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,422
- Two!
- One!

259
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,216
You bloody Hindus, get it right!

260
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:09,345
Stop. Start it again.
In each rank. Count!

261
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,100
Left. Left, right, left.

262
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,269
Right, on my word, march.

263
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:20,565
Left- Get your goddamn hand
out of your pocket, soldier!

264
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,069
Left. Left, right, left.

265
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,071
Oh, look at this.
Bonnie Prince Charlie.

266
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,282
Are you a gentleman? Are you
a member of congress, or something?

267
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,367
Or are you the bloody
prince of Africa?

268
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,245
Don't look at me! Look straight
ahead! Look straight ahead!

269
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,622
I'll eat your ass up, boyo.

270
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,501
You know, the Irish are not noted
for their fondness for the coloreds.

271
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,920
What about the uniforms?

272
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,380
Still no word.

273
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,382
The rifles?

274
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,095
- Left. Left, right left.
- See to it.

275
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,388
You're a big buck.
You're tough, aren't you?

276
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:56,184
You've got a lot to learn.
You haven't had a master like me.

277
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,477
Dear, Mother.

278
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,021
The men learn very quickly.

279
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,690
Faster than white troops,
it seems to me.

280
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,985
They are almost grave
and sedate under instruction...

281
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,530
...and they restrain themselves.

282
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,408
But the moment
they are dismissed from drill...

283
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,539
...every tongue is relaxed
and every ivory tooth is visible.

284
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,042
And you would not know from the
sound of it that this is an Army camp.

285
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,421
They must have had to learn this
from long hours of meaningless...

286
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,965
...and inhuman work.

287
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,343
To set their minds free so quickly...

288
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,345
...it gives them great energy.

289
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,931
And there is no doubt
that we will leave this state...

290
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,268
...as fine a regiment as any
that has marched.

291
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,895
As ever, your son, Robert.

292
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,319
They've done it.

293
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,449
Assemble the men.

294
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,661
Attention!

295
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,955
Battalion!

296
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,839
In accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes...

297
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,758
...you men are advised...

298
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,471
...that the Confederate Congress
has issued a proclamation.

299
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,517
It reads:

300
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,022
"Any Negro taken in arms...

301
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,025
...against the Confederacy...

302
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:31,154
...will immediately be returned
to a state of slavery.

303
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,493
Any Negro
taken in Federal uniform...

304
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,830
...will be summarily put to death.

305
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:51,049
Any white officer
taken in command of Negro troops...

306
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,845
...shall be deemed as inciting
servile insurrection...

307
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,599
...and shall likewise
be put to death. "

308
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,984
Full discharges
will be granted in the morning...

309
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,070
...to all those who apply.

310
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:19,452
- Dismissed.
- Dismissed.

311
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,331
If you're not here in the morning...

312
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,334
...I understand.

313
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,719
Still want that blue suit, nigger?

314
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,636
- Good morning, major.
- Sir. Formed and ready, sir.

315
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,722
How many are left?

316
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,811
Attention!

317
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,148
Battalion!

318
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,502
Glory hallelujah.

319
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,212
One. One, two, one.

320
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,590
One, one. One, two, one.

321
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,675
Company, halt!

322
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,683
You're not dismissed, boyo!
Get up!

323
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,562
You'll fall out when I say
and not before. Do you understand?

324
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,648
I said, get up!

325
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,691
Sergeant major.

326
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,785
- Sir.
- At ease, sergeant.

327
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,708
I have no doubt
that you are a fair man, Mulcahy.

328
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,713
I wonder if you are
treating these men too hard.

329
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,051
You disagree?

330
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:27,640
- You may speak freely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?

331
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,642
We grew up together, yes.

332
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,438
Let him grow up some more.

333
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,610
- I see.
- Will that be all, sir?

334
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,530
Yes.

335
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,533
Dismissed.

336
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,746
- Order.
- Order.

337
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:08,014
Fifty-seven caliber Enfield rifle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.

338
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,765
Sharts.

339
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,851
"11911."

340
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,479
Think you can handle that, boy?

341
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,772
Shit, I can knock something down
with this.

342
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,274
Trip.

343
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,777
"12192."

344
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:25,198
- Beautiful.
- Hawkins.

345
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,409
"12186."

346
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,786
- Jefferson.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,830
Robert.

348
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,209
Finally.

349
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,793
There's a rumor going around...

350
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,755
...that we're to be used
only for manual labor.

351
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,174
I can't believe
the kind of things we hear.

352
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,930
It's not true, is it? I mean,
about not being allowed to fight.

353
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:53,518
The men are all living for that day.
I know I am.

354
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,814
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.

355
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,817
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.

356
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,556
For God's sake, come on!

357
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,850
Good shot, man.

358
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,687
Do that again. Here, give him
your weapon. Give him that.

359
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,854
Do that again.

360
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,691
- One dime, he can't do it.
- Dime? Dime on each of you.

361
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,818
- I want money.
- That's a bet.

362
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,446
- Go on, boy.
- Go ahead. Go ahead, Sharts.

363
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,497
- That's a dime on each of you!
- Double or nothing!

364
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,836
Attention, company!

365
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,089
Attention, company!

366
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,882
As you were.

367
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,844
Front and center.

368
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,726
You're a good shot, private.

369
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,812
Thank you, sir. Squirrel hunting.

370
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,692
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.

371
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,194
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,699
Reload.

373
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,416
Faster.

374
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,503
Faster.

375
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,922
Faster!

376
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,928
Discharge your weapon.

377
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,932
Discharge your weapon.

378
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,477
Do it!

379
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,274
Now do it again.
Only this time, I want it done quickly.

380
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,946
A good man can fire three aimed shots
in a minute.

381
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:16,535
Major Forbes,
give me your Colt revolver.

382
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,621
- What?
- Your gun.

383
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,832
Give it to me.

384
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,755
Faster.

385
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,840
Reload.

386
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,927
Quickly. Faster!

387
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,681
Faster! Load.

388
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,684
Faster!

389
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,979
Do it! Do it!

390
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,023
Do it!

391
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,067
Do it!

392
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,252
Teach them properly, major.

393
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,464
Yes, sir.

394
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,177
Attention, company!

395
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,182
Ready!

396
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,934
Aim!

397
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,019
Fire!

398
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,708
Good morning, major.
You're up early.

399
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,960
I wanna talk to you.

400
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,045
Certainly.

401
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,759
If you wouldn't mind
getting down from your horse.

402
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,982
Better?

403
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,569
Why do you treat the men this way,
Robert?

404
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,281
How should I treat them?

405
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,492
Like men?

406
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,582
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?

407
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,837
He's not a very good soldier.
I'm getting these men ready for battle.

408
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,716
Robert, they're already as good
as the Seventh ever was.

409
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,427
- They march well. They're disciplined.
- No thanks to you.

410
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,263
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

411
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:46,310
Who do you think you are,
acting the high-up colonel?

412
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,438
You seem to forget, I know you...

413
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,398
...and so does Thomas.

414
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,196
Forbes.

415
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,200
If you don't believe in
what we're doing here...

416
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,579
- ... maybe you shouldn't be part of it.
- Part of what?

417
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:12,127
Left, right, left, right, little finger
along the seams of your trousers?

418
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,465
Marching is probably all
they'll ever get to do, Robert.

419
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,177
It is my job...

420
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,056
...to get these men ready.

421
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,891
And I will.

422
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,603
They have risked their lives
to be here.

423
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,313
They have given up their freedom.

424
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,148
I owe them as much
as they've given.

425
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,401
I owe them my freedom...

426
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,778
...my life, if necessary.

427
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,614
Maybe so do you, Cabot.

428
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,492
I think you do.

429
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,171
Develop! Guard!

430
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,674
Thrust! Develop!

431
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,593
Guard! Thrust!

432
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,887
Develop! Guard!

433
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,347
You're not at dancing school, son.
Take his head off.

434
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,641
Thrust! Develop!

435
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,976
Guard!

436
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,186
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
what have we here?

437
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,231
Bonnie Prince Charlie
and his little toy bayonet.

438
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:18,027
You're not reading your books now.
Go on, go on, get over there.

439
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,988
- Now stab me.
- What?

440
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,032
Stab me.

441
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,621
Come on, stab, not tickle. Hit me.

442
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,205
Come on!

443
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,916
You prissy little schoolgirl.

444
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,127
You're the worst soldier
in this whole company. Now hit me!

445
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,722
No shame, son. Get up.

446
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,226
I said, get up.

447
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,646
Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.

448
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,231
Sergeant, deal with that man.

449
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,698
Let me tell you a wee secret, son.

450
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:08,410
The only thing you're to learn
to do is to keep your mouth shut.

451
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,248
Save it, son. Save it.

452
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,251
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcahy.

453
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,755
- First rank to the rear. Back to work.
- Robert. Robert.

454
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:25,552
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment in private, if I may.

455
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:33,352
Enlisted men wishing to speak
to their commanding officer...

456
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,437
...must first get permission.

457
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,357
You understand, private?

458
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,279
Yes, sir.

459
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,032
Guard! Thrust!

460
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,034
Develop! Recover!

461
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,997
Thrust! Develop! Recover!

462
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,916
Thrust! Develop! Recover!

463
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,211
En garde!
Thrust! Develop! Recover!

464
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,256
You better put some oomph
into that, boyo!

465
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,515
Oh, my, my, my.

466
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,018
Some things never change.

467
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,229
I guess the whole world
hate the nigger.

468
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,440
Boy, if you don't quit
that drumming in here...

469
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:24,278
Honey, why don't you take your drum
on outside and practice?

470
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,743
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.

471
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,164
Yeah, swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.

472
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,833
But he in the same boat with us.

473
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:41,295
Secesh come, take him, kill him too.

474
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,255
Not him.

475
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,090
He a swell.

476
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,843
He just a boy.

477
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,264
Yeah. He a weak white boy.

478
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,142
Beating on a nigger
make him feel strong.

479
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,645
Ain't that right, snowflake?

480
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,817
You know, he ain't never been
to no West Point...

481
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,736
...and the only reason
he in charge...

482
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,946
...is because
his mommy and daddy fixed it.

483
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,948
Ain't that so?

484
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,375
You thought he was different,
didn't you?

485
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,422
What you think now?

486
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,387
You just thought you was so smart,
didn't you, nigger?

487
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,974
Yeah, you in real school now
though, ain't you?

488
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,436
What you gonna do? Cry?

489
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,401
Yeah, he sure enough
learning now, ain't he?

490
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,948
- Sergeant, post your sentries.
- Yes, sir.

491
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,741
Attention, company.

492
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,493
Forward, march.

493
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,953
Right face.

494
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,913
Oh, shit.

495
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,418
Young man say there's a farm
ain't but two or three miles from here.

496
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:09,424
Said the lady over there
give him biscuits and gravy.

497
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,013
She said, if he bring his friends,
she feed them too.

498
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,017
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, buck?

499
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,396
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myself some real shoes.

500
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,441
I'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.

501
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,444
Nigger, is you an old man
or is you an old woman? I forget.

502
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,447
All right.

503
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,246
Collard greens.

504
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,459
Corn bread.

505
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,842
Come on, dream.

506
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,179
I'm waiting on you.

507
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,146
Throw it over here.

508
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,482
Dear, Mother.

509
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,402
News today of the defeat
at Fredericksburg.

510
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:14,489
If things continue to go badly,
I wonder if I might not end my days...

511
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,910
...as an outlaw leader
of a band of fugitive slaves.

512
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:22,372
Try as I may,
I don't know these men.

513
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,083
Their music, their camaraderie...

514
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,502
...which is different from ours.

515
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,590
I am placed in a position where,
if I were a man of real strength...

516
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,884
...I might do a great deal.

517
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,346
But I am afraid I shall show
that I am not of much account.

518
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,017
I don't want to stand in their way
because of my own weakness.

519
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,728
I miss Christmas
on the Shaw Island...

520
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,688
...and the smell of the sea.

521
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,900
Robert.

522
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,528
It's Thomas.

523
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,202
I just wanted to say...

524
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,169
I wanted to say...

525
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
Merry Christmas, Robert.

526
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,554
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

527
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,594
You're Shaw, aren't you?

528
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,846
Merry Christmas.

529
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,973
Kendric, division quartermaster.

530
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,517
This sorry piece of work is Haggis.

531
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,185
He writes vouchers.

532
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,062
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

533
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,442
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, very well. Thank you.

534
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,612
That's all right. Brass are all up
to division, planning the next disaster.

535
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,781
You're among friends.

536
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,950
How much longer do you figure
they last?

537
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,870
I hear they're deserting,
10 at a time.

538
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,538
Oh, you're misinformed.

539
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,623
- We haven't had a single incident.
- See?

540
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,209
I figure the nigs
never had it so good.

541
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,628
Three square a day,
a roof over their heads.

542
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,466
And they gotta know that nobody's
gonna let them fight. Am I right?

543
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,178
Yes, of course.

544
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,097
Listen, if there's anything you need.

545
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,642
- A bottle for the cold nights?
- Yes, actually, I put in a requisition...

546
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,103
...for some shoes two weeks ago...

547
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,980
...and I haven't heard anything.

548
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,524
Well, provisionally speaking...

549
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,652
...we're extremely limited
as to footwear.

550
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,988
I'm afraid that kind of item
has to be reserved...

551
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,492
...for those units
whose fighting readiness...

552
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,495
...supersede yours.

553
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,954
You understand, I'm sure.

554
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,668
Yes, I understand.

555
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,220
- Excuse me.
- Oh, stop by tomorrow.

556
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,722
I have got my hands on
the most delicious local jam.

557
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,682
- Myrtle berry, isn't it?
- Blueberry.

558
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,851
Oh, right, right.

559
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,686
Nice meeting you, Shaw.

560
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,443
Twit.

561
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,620
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

562
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,706
We've caught a deserter.

563
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,099
Oh, lordy, this is bad.

564
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,476
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?

565
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,019
No.

566
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,063
It'll be all right.

567
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,815
Won't it?

568
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,735
Re-form your ranks!

569
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,697
- Re-form your ranks!
- Re-form your ranks!

570
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,741
Fall in. Quiet in the ranks.

571
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,620
Quiet in the ranks!

572
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,541
Right. Untie his hands
and take off his coat.

573
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,753
The prisoner is in position, sir.

574
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,922
What is this?

575
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,925
The prisoner is to be flogged
before the entire regiment.

576
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,553
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.

577
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,517
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcahy.
- At your pleasure, colonel.

578
00:46:56,189 --> 00:47:00,317
Never question my authority
in front of others.

579
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:05,113
Well, I is sorry, massa. You be
the boss man now and all us chilluns...

580
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:09,284
- ... must learn to obey.
- Major Forbes, stand at attention.

581
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,462
Sergeant Mulcahy.

582
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:24,799
You may commence.

583
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,817
Proceed.

584
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,531
Attention.

585
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,336
Mr. Rawlins.

586
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,007
This morning I-

587
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,847
It would be a great help
if I could talk to you...

588
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,308
...about the men from time to time.

589
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,526
That's all.

590
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,781
Shoes, sir.

591
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,709
The men need shoes, colonel.

592
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:08,254
Yes, I know. I've been after
the quartermaster for some time now.

593
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,174
No, sir. Now.

594
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,972
The boy was off trying to find hisself
some shoes, colonel.

595
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,975
He wants to fight...

596
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,603
...same as the rest of us.

597
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,773
More, even.

598
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,080
All of the men, like this?

599
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,999
Yes. Most of them.

600
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,683
Good afternoon, colonel.

601
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,936
You change your mind about
that bottle I was talking about?

602
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,231
I want 600 pair of shoes
and 1200 pair of socks...

603
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,942
...and anything else
you've been holding out on us.

604
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,027
Piece of rat filth.

605
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,822
I'd love to help you, colonel,
but we just don't have any.

606
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,115
Not for niggers, you don't.

607
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,952
- Not for anybody.
- I see. Pity.

608
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,247
I'll just have a look around,
see that you haven't misplaced them.

609
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,959
Hey.

610
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,044
Hey!

611
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,881
Son of a bitch!

612
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,258
- Damn it, you can't-
- Can't I?

613
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:38,678
I'm a colonel, nasty little cuss.

614
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:42,307
You really think you can keep
700 Union soldiers...

615
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,977
...without proper shoes
because you think it's funny?

616
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:50,982
- Where would that power come from?
- All right, all right. Calm down.

617
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,069
Look, have a drink.

618
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,167
Hey, you barefoot men,
come on out here!

619
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,710
Got something for you.

620
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,004
Shoes! Shoes!

621
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,756
Have a pair.

622
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,468
Here's a pair there.
One pair of shoes here.

623
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:23,723
Here's another pair.
One pair per customer.

624
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,345
Steward, is there
anything you need?

625
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,056
- No, sir.
- Keep me informed.

626
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,100
Yes, sir. I will.

627
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,902
Shoulder arms!

628
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,154
Sir.

629
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,407
From the War Department.

630
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,167
Can anything be done?

631
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,172
- They've got families.
- I know.

632
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,634
We'll protest this
through channels later on.

633
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,430
- Attention, battalion.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:51,185
Attention, battalion!

635
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,191
You men enlisted in this regiment...

636
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,153
...on the understanding...

637
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,823
...that you would be paid
the regular Army wage...

638
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,492
...of $13 a month.

639
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,203
This morning I have been notified...

640
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,081
...that since you are
a colored regiment...

641
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,043
...you will be paid $10 a month.

642
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,794
That ain't fair. They said 13.

643
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,757
Regiment, fall out by company
to receive pay.

644
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:26,471
- Where you going, boy?
- To get paid.

645
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,098
Ten dollar, a lot of money.

646
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,227
Hey, pop, you fitting to lay down
for this too?

647
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:38,816
- Fall in!
- Fall in!

648
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,238
Hey. Hey, come on.
Where's your pride, now?

649
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,324
Make your mark right here.

650
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,661
- I can write my name.
- Then do it.

651
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,247
They give them $13, only gonna give
us but ten? You gonna go for that?

652
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,709
I mean, a colored soldier stop a bullet
just as good as a white one!

653
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,503
And for less money too!

654
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,256
Yeah. Yeah, Uncle Abe got hisself
a real bargain here!

655
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,634
- Hey, what you say, boy?
- That's right, slaves!

656
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,428
Step right up, make your mark.
Get your slave wages.

657
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,847
All you good colored boys,
go ahead and sign up.

658
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,433
That's right. Tear it up, tear it up.

659
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,436
Tear it up! Tear it up!

660
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:19,107
- Get back in line!
- Tear it up, tear it up!

661
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,276
Tear it up, tear it up!

662
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:28,241
Tear it up! Tear it up!

663
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,122
Tear it up, tear it up, tear it up!

664
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:39,419
Tear it up, tear it up,
tear it up, tear-

665
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,892
If you men will take no pay...

666
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,311
...then none of us will.

667
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,523
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

668
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:03,609
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

669
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:06,070
Let's hear it for the colonel!

670
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,614
Yeah!

671
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,833
Attention, battalion!

672
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:22,670
Attention.

673
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,800
Eyes right!

674
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:20,353
Eyes front!

675
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,152
Eyes...

676
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,404
...right.

677
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,909
Mainly, I forgot how hot
it was down here.

678
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,785
Welcome home, boy.

679
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:03,289
Don't worry about it, buck.
Take a good look.

680
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,875
It's all a memory
now that the North man come.

681
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,711
Now that we come.

682
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,339
Colonel Shaw?

683
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:15,509
Edward Pierce, special assignment
from Harper's Weekly.

684
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,137
- Harper's Weekly?
- Serving an entire nation.

685
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,348
Million readers want to know
what happens...

686
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,767
...when the men
of the 54th see action.

687
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,685
A million and one.

688
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,980
Well, you'll want to see this.

689
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,276
Attention, company!

690
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,529
- Rawlins, front and center.
- Sir!

691
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:41,535
Mr. Rawlins, this regiment
was formed with the promise...

692
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,997
...that only white officers
would be commissioned to lead it.

693
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:49,126
Nothing was mentioned, however,
about noncommissioned officers.

694
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,547
Therefore, in recognition of initiative
taken not only for yourself...

695
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,968
...but on behalf
of the entire regiment...

696
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:01,639
...you are hereby awarded the rank
of sergeant major.

697
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,105
Congratulations.

698
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,192
- Thank you, sir.
- Hip, hip, hooray!

699
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:17,738
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

700
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,869
Congratulations.

701
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,747
I ain't sure I'm wanting this, colonel.

702
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,959
I know exactly how you feel.

703
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:46,726
Mama, they're coming home!
They're coming home!

704
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,491
That's right, hons. Ain't no dream.

705
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,994
We runaway slaves,
but we come back fighting men.

706
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:09,165
Go tell your folks how kingdom come
in the year of jubilee!

707
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,281
Left. Up tight up there.

708
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,326
Left.

709
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,960
- Who are these ragamuffin?
- Contrabands, right out of the fields.

710
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,880
- Hey. Hey, old man, where from?
- Massachusetts.

711
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,342
Oona march better than we.
Oona march like the buckra soldier.

712
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,512
- I beg your pardon?
- He says we march like white soldiers.

713
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,889
Even talk like the buckra soldier.

714
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,517
- Where you from?
- Oh, round about here.

715
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:13,145
We were slaves in the field when the
Yankee man come. Say we soldiers.

716
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,855
How you like the Army, contraband?

717
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,150
Oh, we love it. We thank the Lord
every day for the good vittles...

718
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,236
...and these beautiful clothes.
Tell true.

719
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,321
This year, every day like Christmas.

720
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:25,366
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.

721
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:02,653
Splendid.

722
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:06,115
They've been working for weeks
in anticipation of your arrival.

723
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,659
We're all very excited
to have you here, Shaw.

724
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,953
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.

725
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,746
Hired a group of New Englanders...

726
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:15,624
...to teach our colored
how to read and write.

727
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:19,003
Just your sort of people,
I should think.

728
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,631
The regiment should enjoy
their stay here.

729
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:27,261
Yes, I'm sure we'll have a fine time,
but that's not why we're here.

730
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:32,391
Well, can't promise you much action.
Just having the coloreds around...

731
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:35,186
...seems to have scared the bejesus
out of the Rebs.

732
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,771
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.

733
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,774
I'd like you to meet
some of our instructors.

734
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,776
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.

735
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,029
- It's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- Pleasure.

736
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,781
Dr. Rogers of Philadelphia.

737
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:51,494
- I know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.

738
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:55,581
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.

739
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,750
He's your brigade commander.

740
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,752
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.

741
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,963
Colonel Montgomery's
a real jayhawker from Kansas.

742
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,966
Contraband regiment
is his brainchild.

743
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,512
You didn't think yours were the only
coloreds around, did you, colonel?

744
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,641
- I did, actually.
- Well, I'm sure they'll do just fine.

745
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,226
Have they seen any mischief?

746
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,810
No, sir.

747
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:21,815
I'm hiking a company over
to the Georgia coast in the morning.

748
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,818
We'll be foraging for supplies.
I could use a hand.

749
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,821
That is, if you think
your men are up to it.

750
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,617
They are indeed, sir.

751
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,661
Good. Very good.

752
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,247
- A pleasure.
- Good night.

753
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,749
Beg to report, colonel, sir.

754
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,086
The troop is fed
and bedded down for the night, sir.

755
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,464
Very good, corporal.
Pass the word along to A company...

756
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,841
...we'll be going into action
in the morning.

757
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,429
Very good, sir.

758
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,862
Your men march handsomely, colonel.
My compliments.

759
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,364
Thank you, sir.

760
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,742
I am surprised at how well
you handle them.

761
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,912
See, I am from Kentucky originally
and we owned a few ourselves...

762
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,290
...so it comes naturally to me.

763
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,794
- You are from Boston, are you not?
- Yes.

764
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:29,675
It is impossible to imagine
Boston with slaves.

765
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,901
Company, halt!

766
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,906
- Halt.
- Shoulder arms!

767
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:56,368
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.

768
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:59,330
Well, all right. You hear that, boys?

769
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,874
Let's clear her out!

770
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,131
- What are you doing?
- Liberating this town...

771
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:11,925
- ... in the name of the Republic.
- The musket, colonel?

772
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,302
Never shoot it. Shoot now?

773
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,597
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Go ahead.

774
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,433
Shoot the lady, boys!

775
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,939
- Don't shoot! We ain't Secesh here.
- That man is a civilian.

776
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:29,943
That man is Secesh,
and Secesh is all the same, son.

777
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:37,868
Look around you. You really think
anybody's gonna put these boys...

778
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,412
...into some real combat?

779
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,873
Do you?

780
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,710
They're little children.
Little monkey children.

781
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,421
You just gotta know
how to control them.

782
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,804
Please, let go! Oh, God!

783
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,973
You see what I mean? Children.

784
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:05,896
- Animal! Leave her alone!
- Hey, boy.

785
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,565
Take your hands off the white lady.

786
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,953
That would not have been necessary
if that Secesh woman hadn't started it.

787
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,955
They'll never learn.

788
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,917
You see, Secesh has got to be
swept away by the hand of God...

789
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,211
...like the Jews of old.

790
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,297
And now I'll have to burn this town.

791
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:37,636
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!

792
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:41,724
Tell your men to set torches
and prepare to fire the buildings.

793
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,684
I will not.

794
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,646
That is an order.

795
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:51,316
You will do it or you will be
brought up on charges for disobeying.

796
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,320
It is an immoral order, and by articles
of war I am not bound to obey it.

797
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:59,366
Well, you can just explain that
at your court-marital...

798
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:03,036
...after your men are placed
under my command.

799
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,593
First squad, second platoon.

800
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,972
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to fire the town.

801
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:25,684
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!

802
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:55,047
Right face!

803
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,968
Forward march!

804
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:03,096
Change the colors, sergeant major.

805
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,849
Change the colors.

806
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,019
What you looking at,
biscuit eaters?

807
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,897
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?

808
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,816
You ain't nothing.

809
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:36,088
Dear Father, I need your help.

810
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:40,843
Despite my many requests,
it has become clear...

811
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:44,304
...that we are to be
used only for manual labor.

812
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,350
Morale is low.

813
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,145
The men's good humor
darkened by idleness and despair.

814
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:55,691
Why keep drilling if they are
never given the opportunity...

815
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,484
...to prove themselves?

816
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,361
Attention!

817
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,948
I have written to Governor Andrew
as well as to...

818
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,700
...the general staff in Washington.

819
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:08,495
But I feel that only a letter
directly from you to Lincoln himself...

820
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,123
...can have the desired effect.

821
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,127
I can think of no other course.

822
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,214
I am sure you both pray,
as I do...

823
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:22,009
...that all this has not been in vain.

824
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,136
Look like we going the wrong way.

825
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,639
Hey. Hey, come on, now.
Buck up, boys.

826
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,142
Hey, buck up, now. Come on.

827
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,186
See, someday they're gonna
let the 54th get into it, see?

828
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,188
And all your troubles
would be over, huh?

829
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:39,067
Come on now, cheer up. Hey.

830
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:41,695
What did you say, boy?

831
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,197
"Boy"? Let me tell you-

832
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,701
- Shut up, Trip-
- Would you get up off me, snowflake?

833
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,830
See, let me explain
something to you.

834
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:56,209
See, the way I figure, I figure this war
would be over a whole lot sooner...

835
01:10:56,419 --> 01:11:00,213
...if you boys just turn right on around
and head on back down that way...

836
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,466
...and let us head
where the real fighting is.

837
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,343
Them men dying up that road.

838
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:08,221
And it wouldn't be nothing but
Rebs dying, if they let the 54th in it.

839
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,766
- Listen-
- Hold it!

840
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,519
As you were, Trip. As you were!

841
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,106
You men move on.

842
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,275
Stripes on a nigger.

843
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,903
That's like tits on a bull.

844
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,990
You're looking at
a higher rank, corporal.

845
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,284
Now, you'll obey and you'll like it.

846
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,787
- Make me.
- I'll make you.

847
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,998
- What the hell is going on here?
- Attention!

848
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,249
Attention!

849
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:40,379
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.

850
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,132
- Oh, there ain't no cause for that, sir.
- What's that, sergeant?

851
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:47,386
Well, I mean, it's just
a soldiers' fight, sir.

852
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,392
- All right, you men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!

853
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:54,768
Move it!

854
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,272
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!

855
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:03,652
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.

856
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,821
Go strum a banjo, boy.

857
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,280
Come on.

858
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:15,038
I've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.

859
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:19,292
Thank you.

860
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:24,172
Yeah, button up that collar.

861
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,842
Suck in that gut.

862
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,219
Tuck in them big, black lips.

863
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,930
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.

864
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,307
I don't have to listen to this.

865
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,061
Where you going, boy?

866
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,274
- Let me by.
- Let you by?

867
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:45,277
Let you by?

868
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,572
Let me tell you something, boy.

869
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,742
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like him.

870
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,619
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.

871
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,622
But you ain't never
gonna be nothing to him...

872
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:01,877
...but an ugly-ass chimp
in a blue suit.

873
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:05,922
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.

874
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,718
Well, what we gonna do about it?

875
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,887
Want to fight me, boy?

876
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,306
What you gonna do about it?

877
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,393
You want to fight me, don't you?

878
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,936
Don't you?

879
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,359
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!

880
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:28,320
Hey, get your hands off me,
gravedigger.

881
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,864
Does the whole world
gotta stomp in your face?

882
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:33,950
- Nigger, get your hands off me.
- Ain't no niggers around here.

883
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,369
So the white man give you
a couple of stripes...

884
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:40,123
...next thing you know, you ordering
everybody around like you the massa.

885
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:43,376
Nigger, you ain't nothing
but the white man's dog.

886
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,380
And what are you?

887
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,383
So full of hate you just wanna go
and fight everybody...

888
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,844
...because you've been whipped
and chased by hounds.

889
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,388
That might not be living,
but it sure ain't dying.

890
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,392
And dying's what these white boys
been doing for going on three years.

891
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:03,063
Dying by the thousands.
Dying for you, fool.

892
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,398
I know, because I dug the graves.

893
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,609
And all the time I'm digging,
I'm asking myself:

894
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,445
"When? When, O Lord,
is it gonna be our time?"

895
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,615
Well, time's coming when
we're gonna have to ante up.

896
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:17,244
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!

897
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,123
You watch who you call a nigger.

898
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:24,000
If there are any niggers
around here, it's you.

899
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,796
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass,
swamp-running nigger.

900
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,799
If you ain't careful,
that's all you ever gonna be.

901
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,429
You men go on back to business.

902
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,872
Shaw.

903
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,292
Sit down.

904
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:13,633
Well, colonel,
what can I do for you?

905
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:18,638
You can give me and my regiment
a transfer to combat command.

906
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,474
Couldn't do it, colonel.

907
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,894
You're much too valuable
to my operations here.

908
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,117
May I sit?

909
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,788
Thank you. Major.

910
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,799
I've written a letter to my father...

911
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,886
...asking him
to press Governor Andrew...

912
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,513
...and President Lincoln.

913
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,849
But I don't have to wait for all that,
do I?

914
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:09,064
Colonel Montgomery, would you
bring that ashtray over here?

915
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:15,528
But valuable to your operations here,
do you say?

916
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:18,949
Your foraging, your depredations?

917
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:23,536
Yes, I've become quite a student
of your operations in this region.

918
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:26,748
Thirty-four mansions,
I think it was, pillaged and burned...

919
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:30,543
...under Colonel Montgomery's
expedition of the Combahee.

920
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:34,506
Four thousand bales of cotton
smuggled through the lines...

921
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,675
...with payment
to parties unknown...

922
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,344
...except by you.

923
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,429
False quartermaster requisitions.

924
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,306
Major Forbes here
has seen the copies.

925
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,267
Yes, indeed.

926
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:50,063
Along with confiscated valuables
shipped north as personal baggage.

927
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,233
Shall I go on?

928
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,694
Can you?

929
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:01,074
I can report you
to the War Department.

930
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,578
Oh, yes. I can do that.

931
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:18,341
Let you take your regiment
out to fight.

932
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,679
That's what you want, isn't it?

933
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,597
Show what they can do.

934
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:28,977
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?

935
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,854
When?

936
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,609
Just as soon
as I can write the orders.

937
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,991
Major.

938
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:55,712
Double-quick!

939
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:06,306
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!

940
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:10,769
All right, men, form a firing line.
Over here.

941
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,646
Form a firing line right here.

942
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,952
Front rank, kneel!

943
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,373
Steady, boys!

944
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:39,506
Firing by battalion!

945
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:43,468
- Aim!
- Aim!

946
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,678
Charge!

947
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,680
Fire!

948
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:59,401
Cease-fire! Recover!

949
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,089
Here they come!

950
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,727
- Reload!
- Reload! Load!

951
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:38,648
- Load it! Load it!
- Quickly, men!

952
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,942
- Ready!
- Ready!

953
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,446
- Aim!
- Aim!

954
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,739
Get ready. Get ready.

955
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,867
Fire!

956
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,379
- Reload!
- Reload!

957
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,506
Quickly.

958
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,509
- Fire at will!
- Fire at will!

959
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,273
Pour it in!

960
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,956
Charge!

961
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,698
Look out, boy! Look out!

962
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:10,883
Fire!

963
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,649
They're turning tail!

964
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,907
Run, you Rebs!

965
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:41,039
Another victory!

966
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,044
Deploy skirmishers, captain.

967
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:49,797
- Re-form your ranks!
- Re-form your ranks!

968
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,178
Fall in, on the double.

969
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,305
Form up! Form up!

970
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,519
- Let's do it.
- Skirmish lines.

971
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,981
Fall in! On the double!

972
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,943
- Form company!
- Thomas.

973
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,369
How do, colonel?

974
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,330
Hurts, doesn't it?

975
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:27,126
Well, I'm extremely jealous.

976
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,420
You'll be back in Boston
before me...

977
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,714
...sitting by the fire,
reading Hawthorne...

978
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:34,050
...cup of decent coffee.

979
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,802
I'm not going back.

980
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:41,974
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.

981
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,981
Robert, promise me...

982
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:52,110
...that you won't send me back.

983
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,489
Promise me.

984
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,118
All right.

985
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,787
All right.

986
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:29,772
Colonel Shaw!

987
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:32,024
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?

988
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:35,278
Lee was turned back
in Pennsylvania at Gettysburg.

989
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,781
Now Grant's taken Vicksburg
and all on the Fourth of July.

990
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,700
- My God.
- Yeah.

991
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,161
I know. It looks like it'll all be over
by Christmas.

992
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,289
- So how did they do?
- Splendid. Just splendid.

993
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:48,958
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.

994
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,961
Oh, give me the details. I'll wire it in.

995
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,297
I don't think we got
a prayer of making the paper.

996
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,799
I'll talk to you later in your tent.

997
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,067
As you were.

998
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:24,076
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

999
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:28,664
You fought very well yesterday,
Trip.

1000
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:32,418
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended
that you receive a commendation.

1001
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,087
Yes, sir.

1002
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:39,425
Yes, and I think you should bear
the regimental colors.

1003
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,056
Well-

1004
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,725
It's considered quite an honor.

1005
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,105
Why not?

1006
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,072
Well, I'm...

1007
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:06,661
Wanting to say something, sir,
but I...

1008
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,081
Go ahead.

1009
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:15,336
All right. See...

1010
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,842
...I ain't fighting this war...

1011
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,135
...for you, sir.

1012
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:26,264
I see.

1013
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,184
I mean, what's the point?

1014
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,229
Ain't nobody gonna win.
It's gonna go on and on.

1015
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,148
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.

1016
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,150
Somebody's gonna win.

1017
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:41,779
Who?

1018
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:47,493
I mean, you, you get to go on back
to Boston, big house and all that.

1019
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,163
What about us?

1020
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,165
What do we get?

1021
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,673
Well, you won't get anything
if we lose.

1022
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:09,891
What do you wanna do?

1023
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,185
I don't know, sir.

1024
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,939
It stinks, I suppose.

1025
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,733
Yeah.

1026
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,818
It stinks bad.

1027
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:24,614
And we all covered up in it too.
I mean, ain't nobody clean.

1028
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:33,205
Be nice to get clean though.

1029
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:36,918
How do we do that?

1030
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,760
We ante up and kick in, sir.

1031
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:51,641
But I still don't wanna
carry your flag.

1032
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:58,230
No one will ever take Charleston...

1033
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:01,400
...without first silencing the forts
which protect its harbor.

1034
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:06,572
And the first one that must
be taken is that: Fort Wagner.

1035
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:10,952
Wagner mounts
a 10-inch Columbiad...

1036
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,788
...three smoothbore 32-pounders...

1037
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,165
...a 42-pound carronade...

1038
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,167
...a 10-inch coast mortar...

1039
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,295
...and four 12-pound howitzers...

1040
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:24,632
...plus a garrison
of about a thousand men.

1041
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,259
As many of you gentlemen
may be aware...

1042
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:30,680
...for the last four days,
our Navy has weakened Wagner...

1043
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,848
...with a constant barrage.

1044
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:36,268
Headquarters has determined
a time for our attack.

1045
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:39,271
We will proceed
with a direct frontal assault...

1046
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:42,066
...tomorrow at dusk.

1047
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:45,277
The problem, gentlemen,
is the approach.

1048
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:48,364
The ocean and the marsh
leave only a narrow strip of sand.

1049
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:52,576
A natural defile through which we can
only send one regiment at a time.

1050
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:56,288
Our best hope is that that leading
regiment can keep the Rebs occupied...

1051
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:59,834
...long enough for reinforcements
to exploit the breach.

1052
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,294
Needless to say...

1053
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:05,506
...casualties in the leading regiment
may be extreme.

1054
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,300
General Strong.

1055
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:13,305
The 54th Massachusetts...

1056
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:16,600
...requests the honor of leading
the attack on Fort Wagner.

1057
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,237
It's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?

1058
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:30,322
Yes, sir.

1059
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:33,534
You and your men
haven't slept for two days.

1060
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:36,871
That's right, sir.

1061
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,457
You think they have the strength
to lead this charge?

1062
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:46,881
There's more to fighting
than rest, sir.

1063
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,342
There's character.

1064
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,637
There's strength of heart.

1065
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:00,352
You should have seen us
in action two days ago.

1066
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,564
We were a sight to see.

1067
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:08,569
We'll be ready, sir.

1068
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,073
When do you want us?

1069
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:29,483
- Tomorrow, we go into battle.
- All right.

1070
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:34,238
So, Lordy, let me fight
with the rifle in one hand...

1071
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:36,448
...and the Good Book in the other.

1072
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:39,368
- Amen, brother.
- Amen.

1073
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:44,832
That if I should die
at the muzzle of the rifle...

1074
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:50,296
...die on water or on land...

1075
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:56,302
...I may know that you,
blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.

1076
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,053
- With Jesus. With us.
- That's right.

1077
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:03,475
And I have no fear. Amen.

1078
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:05,352
- Amen.
- Amen.

1079
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,705
Lord...

1080
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:27,499
...we stand before you
this evening...

1081
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,793
- ... to say thank you.
- Thank the Lord.

1082
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,503
We thank you, Father...

1083
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:34,590
...for your grace
and your many blessings.

1084
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,175
Yes, sir.

1085
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,510
Now, I run off...

1086
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:43,515
...and left all my young'uns
and my kinfolk in bondage.

1087
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:46,644
So I'm standing here this evening,
Heavenly Father...

1088
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:51,482
...to ask your blessings on all of us.

1089
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:56,528
So that if tomorrow
is our great getting-up morning...

1090
01:32:56,655 --> 01:33:00,241
...if tomorrow we have to meet
the Judgment Day...

1091
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:04,536
...oh, Heavenly Father,
we want you to let our folks know...

1092
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:06,538
...that we died facing the enemy.

1093
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:10,876
We want them to know
that we went down standing up-

1094
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:12,544
Yes, Lord!

1095
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:16,131
- among those that are fighting
against our oppression.

1096
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:18,342
We want them to know,
Heavenly Father...

1097
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:19,927
...that we died for freedom.

1098
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,183
We ask these blessings
in Jesus' name. Amen.

1099
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,269
- Amen.
- Amen.

1100
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:31,563
- Amen.
- Amen.

1101
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:42,616
Trip. Come on.

1102
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:45,202
- No, I-
- You better get your butt up there, boy.

1103
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:50,207
Just say what you think.
Just say what you feel. Go on now.

1104
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:53,043
- Come on.
- Preach it, brother.

1105
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,839
Go on, let it out.

1106
01:33:58,216 --> 01:33:59,758
I ain't much about
no praying now.

1107
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:02,845
Well, you always say your piece.

1108
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:09,601
I ain't never had no family and...

1109
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:16,275
- Killed off my mama.
- Well...

1110
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:21,613
This feels funny.

1111
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:23,615
- Come on.
- It's all right.

1112
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,619
Come on now. You're doing fine.

1113
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,376
Well, I just-

1114
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,636
You know, y'all's- Y'all's-

1115
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,724
Y'all's the onliest family I got.

1116
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:51,643
Well, that's all right.

1117
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:54,313
And...

1118
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,778
...I love the 54th.

1119
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:02,654
All right.

1120
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:14,291
Ain't much matter
what happens tomorrow...

1121
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:15,667
...because we men, ain't we?

1122
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,669
- Yes, sir.
- Amen.

1123
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:25,135
- We men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir.

1124
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:35,938
- Shit.
- All right, man.

1125
01:36:35,582 --> 01:36:38,750
- Attention, company!
- Attention, company!

1126
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,044
Attention, company!

1127
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:43,922
Attention, company!

1128
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:53,140
Battalion, halt!

1129
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:07,529
We ready, colonel.

1130
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:46,109
Left. Left. Left, right.

1131
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:51,281
Left. Left. Left, right.

1132
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:56,286
Left. Left. Left, right.

1133
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:59,915
Left. Left. Left, right.

1134
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:04,253
- Give them hell, 54th!
- Give them hell, 54th!

1135
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:43,875
- Ready, fire!
- Ready, fire!

1136
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:47,879
- Ought to be quite a show, Pierce.
- Best seat in the house.

1137
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:51,675
I wonder if you might
do something for me.

1138
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,765
I have some letters here.

1139
01:38:58,975 --> 01:39:00,017
Personal things.

1140
01:39:00,226 --> 01:39:01,727
Certainly, colonel.

1141
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:05,314
Also, if I should fall...

1142
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:10,694
...remember what you see here.

1143
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:15,699
- Ready!
- Ready!

1144
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,242
- Fire!
- Fire!

1145
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:18,910
- Fire!
- Reload!

1146
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:20,704
- Reload!
- Fire!

1147
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,626
You men are relieved.

1148
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:28,795
Report to the rear
as stretcher bearers.

1149
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:31,423
- Do it now!
- Right face!

1150
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:34,593
Forward, march!

1151
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:41,933
You go on, honey.
We be by directly.

1152
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:05,726
Shaw!

1153
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,853
Shaw!

1154
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,021
Shaw!

1155
01:41:14,444 --> 01:41:16,153
Shaw!

1156
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:18,196
Shaw!

1157
01:41:50,605 --> 01:41:52,564
If this man should fall...

1158
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:57,694
...who will lift the flag and carry on?

1159
01:42:03,201 --> 01:42:04,451
I will.

1160
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:11,082
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

1161
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:19,674
I'll see you in the fort, Thomas.

1162
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,192
- Fix!
- Fix!

1163
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,444
Bayonets!

1164
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:46,117
- Shoulder!
- Shoulder!

1165
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:47,828
Arms!

1166
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:55,126
- Charge!
- Charge!

1167
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:56,753
Bayonets!

1168
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:06,805
- At the quickstep!
- At the quickstep!

1169
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:09,808
Forward!

1170
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:13,144
March!

1171
01:43:32,164 --> 01:43:33,999
Double-quick time!

1172
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:36,293
March!

1173
01:43:45,303 --> 01:43:46,511
Steady, boys!

1174
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:22,756
Charge!

1175
01:44:40,441 --> 01:44:41,650
Come on!

1176
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:49,240
Forward!

1177
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:51,242
Forward!

1178
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,256
Keep your ranks!

1179
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:15,976
Take cover in the dunes!

1180
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,561
Take cover!

1181
01:45:54,598 --> 01:46:00,311
Company commanders, we'll wait here
and advance under cover of darkness.

1182
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,316
Men, get down over there!
Get down!

1183
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:11,322
Company commanders,
order your men to wait here!

1184
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,203
Get down!

1185
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,247
Get down!

1186
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:44,689
- Sergeant Rawlins!
- Sir!

1187
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,858
Pass the word along!

1188
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:48,860
Forward on my command!

1189
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:50,528
Forward on my command!

1190
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:55,575
Ready on the colors, men!

1191
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:58,369
Forward on my command!

1192
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,246
Ready!

1193
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:06,377
- Charge!
- Charge!

1194
01:47:16,388 --> 01:47:18,807
Forward, men! Forward!

1195
01:47:27,733 --> 01:47:30,401
Forward!

1196
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:35,406
I've been hit!

1197
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:08,940
Forward! Forward, men!

1198
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:23,163
Come on, men, forward!

1199
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:32,964
Come on, you men! Come on!
Don't stop! Get up there!

1200
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:52,567
No!

1201
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:21,429
Come on!

1202
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:28,311
Come on, 54th!

1203
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:33,691
Robert!

1204
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:00,134
Come on!

1205
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:13,773
Charge!

1206
01:50:57,609 --> 01:50:59,402
My eye!

1207
01:51:22,468 --> 01:51:26,637
Rally!

1208
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:39,650
- Form a firing line right here!
- No!

1209
01:51:40,861 --> 01:51:42,487
Get out of here!

1210
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:45,656
Fire!

1211
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:51,662
Let's go! Move! Move!

1212
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:18,521
Come on! Come on!
