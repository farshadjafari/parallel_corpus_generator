1
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:02,173
Six times three.

2
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:05,940
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

3
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:08,338
Hurry up.

4
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:11,840
It's eighteen. Ooh!

5
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:26,007
Ring the bell three times,

6
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:28,775
put your helmet on the ground.
You're done.

7
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:38,108
Commence! You don't make
it, you do it again!

8
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:39,874
You ever been tested this
hard ever in your life?

9
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:40,973
Never.

10
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:45,842
Winning here is a
conscious decision.

11
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,275
Make up your mind
if you want to pass

12
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,842
or choose to fail.

13
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,709
All right now, gentlemen,
I'm gonna introduce y'all

14
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:59,610
to something called "not
being able to breathe."

15
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,143
Andrew! Come back.

16
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,708
Come back to the light.

17
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:14,376
All this shaking and all
this cold. Harness it.

18
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:15,675
Turn it into aggression.

19
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:29,877
You just proved to your
bodies, through your mind,

20
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,978
that you can push yourself further
than you thought possible.

21
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,344
Go get wet! Run!

22
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,111
I'm at my limit, so...

23
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,344
...that's it.

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,878
You sure you want to be here?
Yes, I do.

25
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,177
Are you absolutely sure?

26
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:00,510
I'm positive!

27
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:11,011
Whatever you have to do!

28
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,778
Just find an excuse to win.

29
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:18,278
Keep going.

30
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,879
It pays to be a winner!

31
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:31,181
I like having my buddies
that I can depend on.

32
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,480
And I would like for them
to be able to depend on me.

33
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:35,746
These guys are our
band of brothers.

34
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,015
♪ Silent night

35
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:45,681
♪ Holy night

36
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:49,681
♪ All is calm

37
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,349
♪ All is bright.

38
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,683
There's a storm inside of us.

39
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:10,118
I've heard many team
guys speak of this.

40
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:15,083
A burning.

41
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,083
A river.

42
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,218
A drive.

43
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,251
An unrelenting desire
to push yourself

44
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,919
harder and further than
anyone could think possible.

45
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:48,121
Pushing ourselves into
those cold, dark corners.

46
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,052
Where the bad things live.

47
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:57,519
Where the bad things fight.

48
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:03,653
We wanted that Fight
at the highest volume.

49
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,352
Aloud fight.

50
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,854
The loudest, coldest, darkest,

51
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,321
most unpleasant of the
unpleasant fights.

52
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:37,892
Is this doable?

53
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,093
It's expensive.

54
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,693
How much?

55
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,763
It's an Arabian horse, man.
She got good taste.

56
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:52,860
I know.

57
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:54,626
How much?

58
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,328
I'll find out. Expensive.

59
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:00,227
You're fucked, man.

60
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,028
I know.

61
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:24,129
I'm up.

62
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:28,394
Going down.

63
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,333
Murphy by 1.1.

64
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:18,367
More than that. More
than that, Marcus.

65
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,433
Fucking dude, I was being
generous. Trust me.

66
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:21,967
Who won?

67
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,101
Murph. Murph, barely.
By one second.

68
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:26,165
Barely.

69
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,099
Barely. Head shave?

70
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,902
Head shave or what? I don't know, you
know? It's something to think about.

71
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,033
If I shave his head, I
have to focus on his face.

72
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,002
Face, ears. Oddly-shaped head.

73
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,435
Well, I don't wanna be looking
at him that close, either,

74
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,858
but he has been running his mouth
about beating you. Really?

75
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,400
Fuck, a head shave is fair.

76
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,600
Axe? Better shave him.

77
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:48,503
Make him go eat with the E-3s, work
in the chow hall until it grows back.

78
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:49,701
Frankie, what do you think?

79
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,126
Why the fuck wouldn't
we shave him?

80
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,333
That's valid.

81
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,135
Patton, not that we care,
but what do you think?

82
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,870
Let me see you make a
tactical decision right now.

83
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,001
Well, I could go
both ways on this.

84
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,668
He did lose, but he was close.

85
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,903
And you're Mike Murphy.

86
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,468
You are Mike Murphy.

87
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:05,635
The Mike Murphy.

88
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,302
I would've expected a
bigger separation.

89
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,636
That is a good point.
Backhanded compliment.

90
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:11,603
Patton. Grab my razor.

91
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:12,668
Razor, copy that.

92
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,001
Listen up.

93
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,737
Red Wings' a go.
Tonight, 1800.

94
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:22,602
Beautiful.

95
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:23,769
Am I going?

96
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:25,369
PLO in an hour.

97
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:30,235
Maybe I'll go.

98
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:33,606
It's a maybe. I'll give you
a maybe. Stay optimistic.

99
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:36,937
Boys. Hey, what's up?

100
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:38,937
What the fuck am
I doing wrong?

101
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:41,870
Oh, come on.

102
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,814
I'll tell you what, Shane,
here's your first op.

103
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:45,670
You ready?

104
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:48,037
Clean all this up.

105
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:02,106
The objective of this mission is
to capture and kill Ahmad Shah.

106
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,706
Bad guy. Senior
Taliban commander

107
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,806
responsible for killing Marines
in eastern Afghanistan.

108
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,104
A Tier I target.

109
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,507
If you want a positive I.D.,
note that Shah has no earlobes.

110
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,238
Taraq.

111
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:22,073
His right-hand man. Seems to do
most of his chief shit for him.

112
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:31,273
We're going in with a
four-man Recon team.

113
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:34,341
Axelson, you'll be point.
Myself, I'll be second.

114
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:37,074
Dietz, comms.
Marcus, rear, med.

115
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:39,072
Axe, give us our route.

116
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:41,441
We're gonna be moving up the
back side of this Mountain here,

117
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,974
which is gonna offer great
concealment from the village.

118
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,939
I'm estimating that it's
gonna take us between

119
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:50,242
three and four hours, depending
upon the gradient of the terrain

120
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:52,876
which is that crappy shale.

121
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:54,940
So please lace up.

122
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,442
First things first. You're
gonna win the fight.

123
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:05,741
No medicine in a gun fight.

124
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:08,276
Two weeks ago, Team 8 was
near where we're gonna be.

125
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,018
Capelli got bit
by a rattlesnake.

126
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:12,341
Contrary to popular belief,
there is poison oak,

127
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,444
so watch your cock and balls,
'cause that will suck.

128
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,108
Murph's got the sat phone.

129
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:24,777
The angle of this region is very
steep. Expect typical comms problems.

130
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:26,942
We're gonna be on
two-hour comms windows.

131
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:31,077
If we miss two windows, I'd say wake
somebody up. If not, don't sweat it.

132
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:34,577
Way point one is Budweiser.
Way point two is Miller.

133
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,675
Three is Corona.
Four is Heineken.

134
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:38,976
And for our O.P. 1,
Schlitz Malt Liquor.

135
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,043
And if and when we I.D.
Shah, pass Rick James.

136
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:54,311
Gentlemen, these are your Rules of
Engagement. US forces will comply

137
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,477
with the Law of Armed
Conflict at all times.

138
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,076
Use of deadly force
is authorized.

139
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,642
Allahu Akbar!

140
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:03,809
If you do come under attack,

141
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:08,145
use the appropriate force necessary
to deter or defeat that threat.

142
00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:20,747
Leaving here at 1800. Two
Chinooks and two Apaches.

143
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:24,946
We fly here to the L.Z., insert
the four-man team right here.

144
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:28,145
Then we fly 30
minutes to J-Bad.

145
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:32,413
Here, we'll have 15 team guys

146
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:34,679
and about a dozen Marines
standing by all night.

147
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:38,913
When we hear "Schlitz Malt
Liquor", we're heading back

148
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,278
to Ba-gram for phase two.

149
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:45,347
The QRF will stay
here at J-Bad.

150
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,346
Now the Apaches stay
with the Black Hawks.

151
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:51,847
The movement is so we can
get the 47's back here

152
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:55,347
ready to bring up to phrase
two, once you get eyes on Shah.

153
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,646
Oh,

154
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:00,449
I bringing up tomorrow night's new
guy presentation to 1400 today,

155
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:03,847
so that all may
revel and partake.

156
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:06,146
You better be good, Napoleon.

157
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:07,278
Fuck.

158
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:10,213
A lot of moving parts.

159
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:22,846
We were going to wait and then
she gets her head into it

160
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,448
and when she gets her head
into something, that's it.

161
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:28,249
There's no stopping her, man.
She's going all out.

162
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,214
You know, you should
just let her do it.

163
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,615
You got a handyman woman.
That's a good thing.

164
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:35,515
He's afraid of losing
control over his castle.

165
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:37,081
He's having control issues
'cause he's the one

166
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,114
who's always made the taste
decisions in the family, right?

167
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:42,349
No, she's got great taste.
I... I trust her.

168
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,481
Well, what does she like?

169
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:46,014
Rose Honeydew.

170
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,082
Oh. Is that a color?

171
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:50,147
Mm-mmm.

172
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,514
You better control
that situation.

173
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,148
It's very ongoing.

174
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,316
New grass leads to new
bushes by the windows,

175
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,782
leads to new curtains,
leads to new sofa,

176
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,649
leads to new carpet,
leads to new floor.

177
00:17:00,714 --> 00:17:01,848
New baby.

178
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:03,592
Dude, she's pregnant?
How far along is she?

179
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,848
You know if it's
a boy or a girl?

180
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:07,384
No, she's not pregnant. She's
just on a weird journey,

181
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:09,917
moving through the house,
one room to the next.

182
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:11,582
Sounds expensive.
Sounds pregnant.

183
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,583
Congratulations.

184
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,317
You're fucking late.

185
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:26,015
Sir, I'm good to go.

186
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:27,115
No.

187
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:29,750
You should introduce yourself

188
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,614
and tell us something
about you we don't know.

189
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:33,682
All right. Petty Officer...

190
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,016
Oh, shut up!

191
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:37,349
Get out!

192
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,850
Shut the fuck up!

193
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,016
Hey. Settle down.

194
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:42,354
Give the kid a chance. Remember
what it was like for you.

195
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,050
Petty Officer...

196
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:48,551
Who gives a shit!

197
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,351
Shut the fuck up!

198
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:53,118
Mr. Patton, please.

199
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,618
There we go.

200
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:17,518
More neck.

201
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,787
Come on, dude, you got to
get into it. Lose yourself.

202
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:22,851
Yeah!

203
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:24,751
Whoa!

204
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:27,285
Whoo!

205
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:38,220
Really, really bad.

206
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:39,586
Dude, that was traumatizing.

207
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,120
Can we vote to
push him through?

208
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,252
Because I can't see
that ever again.

209
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,720
Hands up. Push him through!

210
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:46,453
I don't know. Can he say it?

211
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,254
Can you say it? Prove it!

212
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,555
I don't want to watch you
dance again. I really don't.

213
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:51,698
Can you say it, Mr. Patton?

214
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:53,254
I can say it, I can say it.

215
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:56,986
Uh... Don't fuck it up.

216
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:04,788
Come on. No more fucking around.
Come on.

217
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:11,055
Been around the world twice.
Talked to everyone once.

218
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,788
Seen two whales fuck. Been
to three world fairs.

219
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,289
I even know a man in
Thailand with a wooden cock.

220
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:20,623
I push more Peter more
sweeter and more completer

221
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:22,488
than any other Peter
pusher around.

222
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:26,822
I'm a hard-bodied,
hairy-chested,

223
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:29,189
rooting tooting shooting,
parac' hutting

224
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:31,990
demolition double-cap
crimping frogman.

225
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:33,722
There ain't nothing
I can't do.

226
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:36,524
No sky too high, no sea too
rough, no muff too tough.

227
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:39,622
Learned a lot of
lessons in my life.

228
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:43,957
Never shoot a large-caliber man
with a small-caliber bullet.

229
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,790
Drive all kinds of trucks.

230
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:49,057
Two-bys, four-bys, six-bys.

231
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,958
And those big motherfuckers
that bend and go, "ssh-ssh"

232
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:54,690
when you step on the brakes.

233
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:59,058
Anything in life worth doing is worth
overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.

234
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:03,126
I'm a lover, I'm a fighter,
I'm a UDT Navy SEAL diver.

235
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,157
I'll wine, dine, intertwine,

236
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:07,491
and sneak out the back door
when the refueling is done.

237
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,147
So if you're feeling froggy,
then you better jump,

238
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:13,458
because this frogman's been there,
done that and is going back for more.

239
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:14,523
Cheers, boys.

240
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,358
She does not need
an Arabian horse!

241
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,923
How the fuck do you
know about that?

242
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:35,959
I know everything, Murphy.

243
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,726
More a Tennessee
Walker cross stallion.

244
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,859
The original Silver. The
Lone Ranger's horse.

245
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,258
No shit.

246
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:52,693
Glorious horse, Murphy.
Glorious!

247
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:03,529
Razor 11, 64 is two Mikes out.
Establish over watch at 1000 AGL.

248
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:12,860
All right, Commander,
approaching the L.Z.

249
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:13,993
One Mike on the deck.

250
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,692
One minute!

251
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,727
Thirty seconds.

252
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:25,792
Thirty seconds!

253
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:32,762
Roger. Establish over
watch at 5000 MSL.

254
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,495
Bruno 64 will be a fast rope
infill. Stand by, Commander.

255
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:39,895
Good Hoyer. Hold your hover.

256
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,194
Rope's deployed.

257
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,227
First team member on rope.

258
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:45,395
Go!

259
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,528
First man on the ground.

260
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,128
Second man on the rope.

261
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,761
Hey. Next one, Shane, okay?

262
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:59,362
Have fun, you lucky bastard!

263
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:14,864
Lulu 06, Bruno 64
infill complete. RTB.

264
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,532
Apollo 2-2, Spartan O-1.
Radio check.

265
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,397
Spartan O-1, this
is Apollo 2-2.

266
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:49,098
We'll be with you for the next
six hours. Have a nice walk.

267
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:52,432
Apollo 2-2, this is Spartan O-1.
Copy.

268
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:53,964
Comms check. Check.

269
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:55,397
Check.

270
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:56,863
Check.

271
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,666
Spartan O-1, I passed Budweiser.
How copy?

272
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:05,566
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.
Good copy. Budweiser.

273
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,865
Apollo 2-2.

274
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:24,234
Spartan O-1 hit Miller.

275
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:30,233
Sir, Spartan O-1
passes Miller.

276
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:34,034
Spartan O-1, Spartan base.
I copy. Miller.

277
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:47,467
Apollo 2-2, Spartan O-1.

278
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,699
It's Corona.

279
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:52,034
Looks like they're doing
pretty good, Chief.

280
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,035
Apollo 2... Spartan O-1.

281
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,433
It's Hein...

282
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:07,968
Say again, your last?

283
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,534
Spartan O-1. Here's Heineken.

284
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,001
How copy?

285
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,300
Good copy.

286
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:14,968
Spartan O-1 passes Heineken.

287
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,672
It's the final way point.
Call it in.

288
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:30,540
Spartan Base, this is
Spartan O-1. Radio check.

289
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,938
Spartan... Spartan O-1.

290
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:39,706
Spartan O-1, this is Beast master. Say
again. You're weak and unreadable.

291
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:44,005
Take a peek.

292
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:48,438
Spartan Base.

293
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:49,504
Shit.

294
00:25:50,104 --> 00:25:51,183
Can't see half the village.

295
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:53,973
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.
I say again.

296
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:56,073
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.

297
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:57,805
Good copy.

298
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,172
Sir, intermittent comms
with Spartan O-1,

299
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:01,558
but they have
arrived at the O.P.

300
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:05,504
All right, fellas.

301
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:08,708
Our boys are safe and
secure for the day.

302
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:11,107
Team one, back to
Ba-gram with me.

303
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:16,009
Team two, enjoy your time
here at J-Bad. Nighty-night.

304
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:21,607
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.

305
00:26:22,505 --> 00:26:24,406
Sun's up. We're out.
Good luck.

306
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:25,539
A- firm.

307
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:35,107
Find a new spot?

308
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:37,940
Let's try to make that peak.

309
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:40,841
See if that's not better.

310
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:42,841
Sounds good.

311
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,175
Boys all set?

312
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:03,843
They're all set. They're
in position. All's good.

313
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:06,609
Enjoy your night. Sleep well.

314
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:07,809
Enjoy yours, brother.

315
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:08,875
Thanks, Pete.

316
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:12,843
Glorious day. Eh, Patton?

317
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,374
Yes, sir.

318
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:19,043
We good?

319
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:20,707
Yeah. They arrived
about 30 minutes ago.

320
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,876
Should be digging in nice
and tight right about now.

321
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:48,680
- Zulu 06, Bruno 64 is wheels
up. J. - Bad, enrooted Ba-gram.

322
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:23,846
Marcus, on me.

323
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:28,181
Danny, take our six. Inform
command of our new position.

324
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:31,914
Axe. Eyes on.

325
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:02,147
Goddamn. Shit.

326
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,149
That's a lot more
than 10 guys.

327
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,515
That's a fucking army.

328
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,181
Four guys on the right.

329
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:32,015
Red scarf.

330
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:35,216
No earlobes.

331
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:43,749
Ooh!

332
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:47,183
Super freak. That's
Rick James, bitch.

333
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,449
You make that shot?

334
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:54,218
Negative. Wouldn't
have authority anyway.

335
00:29:58,515 --> 00:30:01,184
Dietz, we got Shah P-I.D# d.
Call in Rick James.

336
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,249
Fuck, yeah.

337
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:04,050
Axe, you sexy in there?
You comfy?

338
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:05,717
Solid. Advise on target.

339
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:07,851
Danny, you make comms yet?

340
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:09,316
No joy.

341
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:10,784
Fuck.

342
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:13,916
We're too exposed.

343
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:17,351
What do you think?
Keep Axe at O.P. 1?

344
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:21,019
Move back twenty-five
yards, set up O.P. 2?

345
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:24,183
Roger that.

346
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,918
Axe, you're on surveillance.

347
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:30,222
Dietz, fall back to O.P. 2 and
get me some fucking comms.

348
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:34,055
Spartan Base, this
is Spartan O-1.

349
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:35,755
Radio check. How copy?

350
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,153
Hey, L.T.

351
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:38,320
Yeah.

352
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:39,918
If we're home by the
15th, me and Morgan

353
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,917
are gonna cut down all the
trees around the stable.

354
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,321
How is that gonna help me?

355
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,620
Hello?

356
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:48,722
Brahms horse auction
is, I think, the 27th.

357
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:51,189
That means if I cut down the
trees behind the stable,

358
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:52,493
I get a discount
for your horse.

359
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,154
Do they sell Arabic horses?

360
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,691
First of all, it's not an Arabic
horse, okay? It's an Arabian horse.

361
00:31:57,755 --> 00:31:58,755
Arabic.

362
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:00,955
It's... You're from
New York, okay?

363
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,855
How much is an Arabic horse?
It's Arabian horse.

364
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,921
How much is an Arabian horse?

365
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:08,356
No less than 15 grand.

366
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,022
Fifteen fucking grand?

367
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:11,788
Hell of a wedding present.

368
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:23,156
Is that redhead a bridesmaid?
Radio check. How copy?

369
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:24,756
Melissa? The redhead, dude.

370
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:25,888
The one with freckles
on her nose.

371
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:27,022
The cute one from the
Cold play concert.

372
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:28,423
That's Melissa.

373
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,889
Is she coming? She's
a bridesmaid.

374
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:31,790
Yeah. Is she coming?

375
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:36,724
She's a bridesmaid. Yes.

376
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,556
Did she ask about me? No.

377
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:45,692
Mikey, I'm good here. I'm
going to break down O.P.1.

378
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:47,190
Copy that.

379
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:57,393
Listen up. At 0930, we move to
high ground and make comms.

380
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:01,826
Marcus, Axe, shut her down.
Dietz, you got security.

381
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,058
Rest up, gents.

382
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,825
Can you get off the radio
while you're chewing?

383
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,593
You're making me nauseous.

384
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:35,396
Mikey, you see this?

385
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:43,163
What the fuck is this?

386
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:54,829
Oh, shit.

387
00:35:42,398 --> 00:35:43,398
Get down!

388
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:44,566
Down!

389
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:55,234
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

390
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,332
Get up.

391
00:35:57,398 --> 00:35:58,899
Get your hands back.

392
00:35:58,965 --> 00:36:00,633
Spartan Base, Spartan O-1.

393
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:02,032
Stepped right the fuck on me.

394
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:09,203
What the fuck is this? What the
fuck? Are you talking to Taliban?

395
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:12,466
Fucking Tali.

396
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:16,935
Saying again. This is
Spartan O-1. Over.

397
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,500
Come on. Come on.

398
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:21,601
Hey, eyes down. Eyes down.

399
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:23,867
Eyes down. Eyes down.

400
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:24,999
Motherfuck.

401
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,935
Axe. Eyes on him,
what he does.

402
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,734
Fuck.

403
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:46,336
Spartan Base, this is
Spartan O-1. Over.

404
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,135
Danny, your radio working?

405
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,202
So now I'm going
to be that guy

406
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,702
calling on an unsecured sat line
because your shit ain't functioning.

407
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:00,805
Talk to the Mountain, sir.

408
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:03,035
Eyes down. Eyes down.

409
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,235
Motherfuck.

410
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,669
You know, it's feeling
like a cursed op.

411
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,637
It's not a cursed op.
There's no curses.

412
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:20,270
It's just Afghanistan.
That's all.

413
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:29,503
J- Bad TOC, Sergeant
Hasslert speaking.

414
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:32,505
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.
Do you hear me?

415
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:35,069
Hello.

416
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:36,836
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.

417
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:39,038
Yes, yes, I can hear you, sir.

418
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,171
I am calling on an
unsecured line.

419
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:42,835
I need to speak to the C.O.
immediately.

420
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:44,737
The C.O.? That's correct.

421
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:45,937
Which C.O., sir?

422
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:47,170
Commander Kristensen.

423
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:49,704
Commander Kristensen
isn't here, sir.

424
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:51,237
Ah, he's at Ba-gram.

425
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,737
Yes, that's correct, sir.

426
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:55,539
I need you to transfer me
to Ba-gram Ouellette TOC.

427
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,004
Now.

428
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,238
Roger that, sir. Stand by.

429
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,809
Ouellette. Petty
Officer Patton.

430
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,939
Patton, Mike Murphy.

431
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,572
You're looking
for Mike Murphy?

432
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,472
This is Mike Murphy.
Do you copy?

433
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:15,771
Mike?

434
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:19,005
This connection sucks.
What's up, man?

435
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,373
Patton, get me
the Skipper now.

436
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:23,139
He's sleeping, sir.

437
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:24,538
Wake him the fuck up.

438
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,873
Did you say wake him up, sir?

439
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:29,939
Right fucking now.

440
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,373
Roger that.

441
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:34,639
Murph wants me to
wake the Skipper.

442
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:37,073
Mike Murphy? Yeah.

443
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:39,073
That's Mike Murphy?
Well, go get him.

444
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,007
Commander Kristensen?

445
00:38:54,405 --> 00:38:55,740
Commander Kristensen?

446
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,840
Sir, sorry, sir.

447
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,574
I got Lieutenant Murphy on the
phone for you in the TOC.

448
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,038
He says he needs to
talk to you now.

449
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:17,541
Which one?

450
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:18,708
Right there.

451
00:39:20,874 --> 00:39:22,909
Mike? Mike?

452
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:25,441
Oh, it dropped.

453
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,176
Mike?

454
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:29,909
It's dead. What did he say?

455
00:39:30,574 --> 00:39:32,093
Uh, just that he
needed to talk to you.

456
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,408
Why is Murphy calling
on a sat phone?

457
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,043
No idea.

458
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,177
Are we having comms
problems with Spartan O-1?

459
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:43,243
We were good for a while, but we've
missed two windows now, sir.

460
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:44,842
Two.

461
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:47,777
Try him back! For fuck's sake.

462
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:10,245
Fuck! Worst fucking comms.

463
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:11,977
Well, we could light
the goats on fire,

464
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,043
smoke signal our
way out of here.

465
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:15,577
Yeah, I could walk down to the
village, ask to borrow a phone.

466
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:18,045
You'd get some interesting
tile ideas down there, bro.

467
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,945
Afghan Dirt Brown,
Goat Skin Blond.

468
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,343
Shit, she'll dig that a
hell of a lot more than,

469
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:22,677
what is it, fucking
Honey Cream?

470
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,279
Sit down. Sit down!

471
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:46,278
Way I see it, we
got three options.

472
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,980
One, we let them go, hike up.

473
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:54,114
We'll probably be found
in less than an hour.

474
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:58,014
Two, we tie them up,
hike out, roll the dice.

475
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:02,547
They'll probably be eaten by fucking
wolves, or freeze to death.

476
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:08,212
Three?

477
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:09,780
We terminate the compromise.

478
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:30,716
Shah's down there. We let them go,
we're letting him go. Mission fails.

479
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:40,847
No, Mikey.

480
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,649
I don't like it. I don't
fucking like it at all.

481
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:47,415
What are we gonna do? We
gonna kill them? Huh?

482
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,516
Okay, we kill them, right? What,
then what? Fucking bury 'em?

483
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:52,148
They get found, then what?

484
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,548
Then what?

485
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,148
What do you mean, then what?

486
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:56,815
And then what?

487
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,682
You know then what.

488
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:01,049
What do you think? This
shit's gonna be private?

489
00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:03,353
Huh? It's gonna be out there
for the whole fucking world.

490
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:06,184
CNN, okay? "Seals kill kids."

491
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:07,581
That's the fucking
story forever.

492
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:09,605
It's nobody's fucking
business what we do up here.

493
00:42:11,414 --> 00:42:14,751
We do what we do.
What we have to do.

494
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:17,483
This is the fucking Navy and
you're the fucking boss,

495
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:19,816
so you make the
fucking call, sir.

496
00:42:25,582 --> 00:42:28,118
Shah killed 20
Marines last week.

497
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,316
Twenty.

498
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,519
We let him go, 20 more
will die next week.

499
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:38,919
Forty more the week after that.
Our job is to stop Shah.

500
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:43,919
Why do these men have the right
to dictate how we do our job?

501
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:46,717
Rules of Engagement says
we cannot touch them.

502
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,885
I understand.

503
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,217
And I don't care.

504
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:56,064
I care about you.
I care about you.

505
00:42:56,385 --> 00:42:58,084
I care about you.
I care about you.

506
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:01,020
I don't want your mom
seeing your head,

507
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:04,219
your decapitated
head on Al Jazeera.

508
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:06,718
That is Shah.

509
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,884
I don't see it that way.

510
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:13,021
Where do you think he's running
to? 200 friends down there.

511
00:43:13,085 --> 00:43:16,320
Got guys in Leavenworth doing
20 for taking home trophy guns.

512
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:17,451
What do you think
they're gonna do

513
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:20,087
for two fucking kids and
an old fucking man?

514
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:21,986
Fucking look at them, man.

515
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,552
They fucking hate us.

516
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:30,856
Look, at him. That's not a kid, that's a
soldier. That's death. Look at death.

517
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:32,653
We can't do it. Look
at that soldier.

518
00:43:32,718 --> 00:43:34,653
They are unarmed prisoners.

519
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:38,922
And the second they run down there,
we got 200 hajis on our backs.

520
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,219
Tie 'em up.

521
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,452
Tie 'em up. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

522
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,587
We can't just fucking
leave 'em, let 'em go!

523
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:45,520
I thought you were standing by
waiting for your fucking orders?

524
00:43:45,586 --> 00:43:47,454
I am standing by waiting
for my fucking orders.

525
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:48,887
What do you think
that radio's for?

526
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:50,453
They're not calling
Domino's Pizza.

527
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,753
I know what the
fucking radio's for.

528
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:53,120
That radio's fucking Tali.

529
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:54,520
It's a cell phone
to the Taliban.

530
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:57,422
So you just think it'll just
be our little secret? Huh?

531
00:44:00,419 --> 00:44:01,921
That's a warrior.

532
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:03,219
Schwack them.

533
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,788
We cannot do that.

534
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,921
This is a soft compromise.

535
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:10,185
You want to go to Leavenworth?

536
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:12,289
You don't know how many hajis
they have down there, man.

537
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:13,554
Don't let him influence you.

538
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,854
Marcus, I'm just saying,
you can't just say...

539
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,154
Look at that child.

540
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,022
Make up your fucking mind and
don't let him influence you.

541
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:19,121
Schwack them.

542
00:44:19,186 --> 00:44:20,956
Mikey, it's your fucking call.
I ain't fucking voting.

543
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,756
This is not a vote.

544
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:27,891
This is what we're gonna do.
This op is compromised.

545
00:44:31,254 --> 00:44:33,789
So we're going to
pack up everything.

546
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:37,124
We're gonna cut them loose and
we're gonna make this peak.

547
00:44:37,187 --> 00:44:40,190
When we make this peak,
you're gonna get comms up.

548
00:44:40,421 --> 00:44:44,926
When we get these comms up, we're gonna
call for extract and we're going home.

549
00:44:46,254 --> 00:44:47,355
Roger that, sir.

550
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:49,122
Roger that. Roger.

551
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,123
Spartan O-1. Spartan
O-1, do you copy?

552
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:52,857
Fisher? Coffee.

553
00:44:53,755 --> 00:44:56,491
Spartan O-1, radio
check, do you copy?

554
00:45:00,422 --> 00:45:04,860
Radio check for Spartan O-1.
Radio check. Spartan O-1.

555
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:12,592
Spartan O-1... Spartan
O-1, do you copy?

556
00:45:18,256 --> 00:45:19,690
Where are you guys going?

557
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:21,524
Just got called north!

558
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,757
We're QRF!

559
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,157
We have troops in contact!

560
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:25,758
But we're fucking QRF!

561
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,158
We're going! We have TIC!

562
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:37,625
What the fuck is
with the Apaches?

563
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:38,892
Troops in contact.

564
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:42,660
Limited resources, Chief.
There ain't enough Apaches.

565
00:45:44,257 --> 00:45:45,558
That's fucked up.

566
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:47,258
They'll be back.

567
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:03,892
Hey. Hey.

568
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:06,693
You just won the lottery.

569
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:52,065
Any station, listen up.
Please relay to Spartan O-1.

570
00:47:53,796 --> 00:47:55,932
Spartan to base, do you copy?

571
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,833
Spartan O-1, Spartan O-1
to base, do you copy?

572
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:26,633
Fuck.

573
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,768
Oh, fuck!

574
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:55,234
False summit.

575
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:06,600
Fuck! Yeah.

576
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,134
Danny, get me some comms.

577
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:12,537
Come on. Spartan Base,
this is Spartan O-1. Over.

578
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,468
What do you want to do?

579
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,202
Go home. Get in bed,
watch Anchorman.

580
00:49:17,434 --> 00:49:18,832
Yeah, Roger that.
What do you think?

581
00:49:19,267 --> 00:49:21,034
I think we did
the right thing.

582
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:22,500
I think we let our
love light shine.

583
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:24,101
Fuck me!

584
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:26,469
I mean, isn't that
how things work?

585
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:28,068
Good things happen
to good people?

586
00:49:28,534 --> 00:49:29,702
This is a bad spot.

587
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,803
Danny, I got nothing here
on sat. Give me something.

588
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:33,906
I don't have fucking shit.

589
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:36,202
How do you feel?

590
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:38,002
This is a bad spot.

591
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,269
You okay?

592
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:41,603
All set.

593
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:45,737
Good. Let's fall back to that
tree line. Wait till sundown.

594
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,736
If we can't make comms, we're
walking home anyways, gents.

595
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,203
Let's get some rest.

596
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:51,036
Pack up, let's move.

597
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:53,170
Fuck.

598
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:05,604
Spartan O-1, Spartan
to base, do you copy?

599
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,105
Spartan O-1, radio
check, do you copy?

600
00:50:09,436 --> 00:50:11,703
Sir, they've now
missed three windows.

601
00:50:14,603 --> 00:50:15,870
Okay.

602
00:50:23,237 --> 00:50:25,838
Commander Shriver, there's
a call for you on line 17.

603
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:27,071
Roger.

604
00:50:32,337 --> 00:50:33,504
Commander Shriver.

605
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:34,871
Uh, sir, this is Erik.

606
00:50:34,937 --> 00:50:39,041
For your S.A., we have missed three
comm windows with Spartan O-1.

607
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:42,172
Last known comms were at 0700.

608
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:43,836
Why am I hearing this
from you right now?

609
00:50:44,104 --> 00:50:46,640
Sir, we expected to have
some comms problems.

610
00:50:47,037 --> 00:50:49,873
Murphy and I discussed and agreed
that we would not start a spin

611
00:50:49,937 --> 00:50:51,472
until after he
missed two windows.

612
00:50:51,938 --> 00:50:53,738
Is there a fucking
problem here, Erik?

613
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:56,440
Sir, I've told you everything
I have at this point.

614
00:50:56,505 --> 00:50:58,373
I will call you when I
have more information.

615
00:50:58,438 --> 00:51:00,273
This is Commander
Kristensen out.

616
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:03,440
Fuck.

617
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,346
I'm going to do some Recon.
Be back in two minutes.

618
00:52:36,775 --> 00:52:39,078
You want some company?
Negative.

619
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:46,780
I'm going to do about two minutes
of Recon. Be right back.

620
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:52,547
We're about to get contacted.

621
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,814
How fucking fast
are these guys?

622
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:03,980
Fast.

623
00:54:04,812 --> 00:54:05,914
What are you thinking?

624
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,277
I'm thinking we're about getting fixing
to get into a pretty good gun fight.

625
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:11,580
Copy that.

626
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:14,382
Looks like I voted wrong.

627
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,546
Negative.

628
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:18,248
We just got the opportunity

629
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:21,283
to make hell fucking strong contact
with our friend from the other side.

630
00:54:21,347 --> 00:54:22,481
Job well done.

631
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:24,715
Hoo-yah to that, sir.

632
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,449
Danny, get ready to fight.

633
00:54:38,848 --> 00:54:40,182
Hey, Mikey...

634
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:44,216
I'm about ready to
punch that time card.

635
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,581
Do it.

636
00:55:35,983 --> 00:55:38,485
Push left! Marcus, move!

637
00:56:08,384 --> 00:56:09,384
Moving!

638
00:56:41,653 --> 00:56:43,321
Motherfucker.

639
00:57:02,421 --> 00:57:04,456
Spartan Base, this
is Spartan O-1.

640
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:07,857
Request immediate QRF!
Troops in contact!

641
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:12,456
Fuck! Fuck.

642
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:20,457
Fucking shit! Motherfuck!

643
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:22,456
Motherfucker!

644
00:57:32,189 --> 00:57:33,189
Allahu Akbar!

645
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:38,558
Contact, twelve o'clock!

646
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:01,356
Axe?

647
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:03,058
Yeah.

648
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:11,492
Mikey. Left is good.

649
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,258
I say again, left is good.

650
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:22,658
Mikey!

651
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:26,361
Left is not good! I say
again, left is not good!

652
00:58:26,425 --> 00:58:27,526
Roger that! Push right!

653
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:46,926
We are good right.

654
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:49,161
Push right. Push right.

655
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,226
Push right.

656
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:54,960
Murph, down!

657
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:00,426
Goddamn motherfuckers!

658
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:03,128
Fuck you!

659
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:07,326
Smoke out!

660
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,928
Hey! Consolidate on Mikey!

661
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,129
Shit! Fuck!

662
00:59:25,794 --> 00:59:27,929
Right is no good!
Right is no good!

663
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:29,961
Move!

664
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:39,463
Back! Back!

665
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:42,295
First man!

666
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:45,831
Mikey! Consolidate on me!

667
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:56,729
Fuck.

668
01:00:07,129 --> 01:00:09,431
I think we can take 'em, Mikey,
but we're gonna need a new spot!

669
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:11,765
Roger that! Danny, comms!

670
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:14,898
Negative! Radio's down
hard, it took some rounds!

671
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,298
You got crypto? Yeah!

672
01:00:17,563 --> 01:00:19,197
Gas the fucking
radio, we're moving!

673
01:00:19,363 --> 01:00:20,430
Roger that!

674
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:23,363
Shit!

675
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:28,431
Ow, fuck!

676
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:31,198
Ow! Fuck!

677
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,398
Marcus, on me!

678
01:00:37,297 --> 01:00:38,631
Fuck!

679
01:00:40,464 --> 01:00:41,798
We're falling back!

680
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,033
You mean fall off?

681
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,431
Yeah! Fuck!

682
01:00:44,497 --> 01:00:45,764
Axe!

683
01:00:46,297 --> 01:00:47,966
Axe, on me!

684
01:00:48,197 --> 01:00:50,465
Ready? Move it!

685
01:00:53,464 --> 01:00:54,966
Ready? Roger!

686
01:00:55,032 --> 01:00:56,533
Go, go, go!

687
01:01:04,432 --> 01:01:05,499
Jesus.

688
01:01:06,665 --> 01:01:07,732
Shit.

689
01:01:10,198 --> 01:01:12,199
Oh, my God.

690
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:18,066
Fuck.

691
01:01:58,233 --> 01:01:59,569
I lost my rifle.

692
01:02:00,768 --> 01:02:03,269
My rifle. My...

693
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:07,969
Shit.

694
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:22,402
You see? God's
looking out for us.

695
01:02:22,468 --> 01:02:26,205
If that's God looking out for
us, I'd hate to see him pissed.

696
01:02:26,569 --> 01:02:29,238
Oh, God... thank
you, thank you!

697
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:33,770
Where's Axe?

698
01:02:35,469 --> 01:02:37,204
That sucked.

699
01:02:38,702 --> 01:02:40,503
They fuck... They
fucking shot me.

700
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:41,771
Living in the past, Danny.

701
01:02:41,836 --> 01:02:43,195
We're all shot, bro.
Can you fight?

702
01:02:43,269 --> 01:02:46,171
Messed up my drawing hand,
that pisses me off.

703
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,171
All right, we're good.

704
01:02:50,503 --> 01:02:51,670
We just gotta get
to flat ground,

705
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:53,971
then we take these
motherfuckers, that's it.

706
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,471
Fucking foot!

707
01:03:02,637 --> 01:03:04,639
Goddamn, this sucks! Oh, fuck.

708
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,405
Fuck you.

709
01:03:10,804 --> 01:03:11,905
Fuck!

710
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:18,106
Damn! Fucking burns!

711
01:03:18,371 --> 01:03:20,005
Danny. I can fight.

712
01:03:21,271 --> 01:03:22,906
Way to go, buddy.

713
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:28,772
Peel left! Peel left!

714
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:30,539
Last man!

715
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:33,239
Let me see it. You okay?
Give me your arm. Yeah.

716
01:03:35,004 --> 01:03:36,406
Whoa. Passing to the left!

717
01:03:46,172 --> 01:03:47,239
Come on down!

718
01:04:20,674 --> 01:04:21,741
Danny!

719
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,208
Let's go.

720
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:25,542
Get them up! Come on.

721
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:35,742
Come on.

722
01:04:36,642 --> 01:04:37,642
Come on.

723
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:38,874
Over...

724
01:04:42,575 --> 01:04:43,709
Come on.

725
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,209
Come on!

726
01:04:45,608 --> 01:04:48,677
Come on. Come on. Come on.

727
01:04:51,942 --> 01:04:53,678
Come on. Find a fucking strap.

728
01:04:53,742 --> 01:04:55,210
Get him up. Get him up.

729
01:04:57,341 --> 01:04:59,010
Come on. Fuck.

730
01:05:00,342 --> 01:05:02,077
Get him. Get him up.

731
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:17,877
Fuck. Fuck.

732
01:05:28,444 --> 01:05:30,679
I got two mags, one frag.

733
01:05:32,377 --> 01:05:33,878
Hey.

734
01:05:38,777 --> 01:05:40,111
Oh, man.

735
01:05:40,277 --> 01:05:41,479
Hey.

736
01:05:41,611 --> 01:05:42,911
Oh.

737
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,612
This is bad here.

738
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:45,911
Mm.

739
01:05:45,977 --> 01:05:47,078
This is a fucking problem.

740
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,546
Fucking no comms.

741
01:05:50,944 --> 01:05:52,346
Fucking comms.

742
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,689
You're okay, right? Shot
me up pretty good, bro.

743
01:05:57,045 --> 01:05:58,880
This hand, let me see.

744
01:06:00,978 --> 01:06:04,449
You're all right. Look at me.
Hey, look at me.

745
01:06:04,911 --> 01:06:06,779
You okay? Huh?

746
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:09,348
Suck it the fuck up, okay,
Danny? You're a fucking frogman.

747
01:06:10,045 --> 01:06:12,281
Fuck, I lost my med kit.

748
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:14,715
You got a little hit in the
leg, okay? Look it here.

749
01:06:15,046 --> 01:06:16,347
You okay?

750
01:06:17,646 --> 01:06:19,247
Hold on. Okay.

751
01:06:19,612 --> 01:06:21,013
There.

752
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:25,416
Okay? Okay. Okay. Lay back.
Lay back.

753
01:06:26,046 --> 01:06:28,882
Let me see, Mikey. Come here.
Let me see it.

754
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:31,380
Fuck.

755
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,281
You pack it with some fucking
dirt, tight, you hear me?

756
01:06:36,447 --> 01:06:38,781
Keep it packed
tight, all right?

757
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,582
I fucking love Afghanistan.

758
01:06:42,113 --> 01:06:43,682
Come here, buddy. Hold up.
Yeah, we're all set.

759
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:45,583
Let me see. Let me see you.

760
01:06:45,648 --> 01:06:46,781
Get your head down.
Let me see.

761
01:06:46,846 --> 01:06:47,881
All right, heads down.
Get your head down.

762
01:06:47,947 --> 01:06:50,249
Let me see you. Come here.
Keep your head down.

763
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,215
Let me see you. I'm good.

764
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:55,882
Yeah, I know you're good.
I know you're good. Easy.

765
01:06:56,214 --> 01:06:58,282
Mikey, how'd they get us
so fast? Shut the fuck up!

766
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:02,816
Do you fucking see them?

767
01:07:02,881 --> 01:07:04,082
Bro...

768
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:08,384
I just don't understand how
fucking fast they were, man.

769
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,517
Oh, fuck. I just...

770
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,616
Fucking faster than we are?

771
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:14,349
They're not faster than us.

772
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:16,983
I was fucking
talking to my mom.

773
01:07:17,048 --> 01:07:19,683
She didn't fucking
say nothing about...

774
01:07:19,747 --> 01:07:22,065
She didn't fucking say nothing!
Danny, suck it the fuck up.

775
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:32,519
Oh, fuck, such vivid reds. Oh!

776
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:34,083
We got to move, Mikey.

777
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:47,884
Fuck. Mikey, what do you want?

778
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:49,117
Axe, smoke!

779
01:07:49,383 --> 01:07:50,417
Smoke up!

780
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,585
Smoke 'em!

781
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,351
Oh, they're coming!

782
01:07:54,883 --> 01:07:57,085
Get the fuck up and get
your fucking legs working,

783
01:07:57,183 --> 01:07:58,318
you hear me? Yeah.

784
01:07:58,384 --> 01:07:59,717
Come on, let's go!

785
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:06,885
Let's go!

786
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,785
You got Danny? I got him.

787
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,686
Axe, we're moving down!
Move where?

788
01:08:12,284 --> 01:08:13,451
Down!

789
01:08:14,684 --> 01:08:15,718
Good to go.

790
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:29,453
Danny! Danny!

791
01:09:35,288 --> 01:09:37,622
RPG. RPG.

792
01:09:41,854 --> 01:09:42,922
Fuck!

793
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:55,189
You good Danny?

794
01:09:57,855 --> 01:09:59,654
Where's Danny? Where's Danny?
I don't see him.

795
01:10:01,422 --> 01:10:03,190
Is he hit? Is he hit?

796
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:04,323
Is he hit?

797
01:10:05,022 --> 01:10:07,023
Where is he? Where's Danny?
I don't see him.

798
01:10:07,156 --> 01:10:08,156
Where is he?

799
01:10:08,555 --> 01:10:10,057
He's up top. What?

800
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,690
He's up top. He got... Where?

801
01:10:11,756 --> 01:10:13,023
He got hit in the head.
Up top where?

802
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:14,357
Fuck.

803
01:10:14,522 --> 01:10:16,091
We gotta go get him.
Up top where?

804
01:10:16,157 --> 01:10:17,316
We got to go get him. Up top.

805
01:10:17,457 --> 01:10:19,058
Where's Danny? Did he get hit?

806
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:20,157
We got to go get him.
We gotta get him.

807
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,358
We got to get up
there and get him.

808
01:10:21,423 --> 01:10:23,258
We can take 'em on flat ground.
We gotta get up top.

809
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,924
We get up there, we get
him, get him down the hill,

810
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,424
and then we can take 'em on flat
ground. We take 'em on flat ground.

811
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,057
Fuck!

812
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,792
Come on! Axe, get up here now!

813
01:10:34,224 --> 01:10:35,224
Get him up here.

814
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:37,126
Come on, Axe, you
gotta get down!

815
01:10:58,358 --> 01:10:59,759
Oh, fuck!

816
01:11:00,392 --> 01:11:02,360
We're gonna go
get Danny up top

817
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,526
and then we're gonna come back
down and fight on flat ground,

818
01:11:04,624 --> 01:11:06,393
we're gonna kill 'em all.

819
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:07,559
Marcus, you good?

820
01:11:08,725 --> 01:11:09,826
I'm good!

821
01:11:09,925 --> 01:11:11,760
Axe, you're security,
and let's go.

822
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:13,126
Roger.

823
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:14,293
Let's move.

824
01:11:19,058 --> 01:11:20,394
Moving!

825
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,294
Let's move!

826
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,229
You can die for your country.
I'm going to live for mine.

827
01:11:40,327 --> 01:11:41,427
Fuck.

828
01:11:42,859 --> 01:11:43,962
Fuck!

829
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,862
Marcus, move!

830
01:11:50,626 --> 01:11:51,961
Moving!

831
01:12:04,061 --> 01:12:05,629
I don't think we can
get up from here.

832
01:12:05,694 --> 01:12:07,333
We ain't out-fucking
flanking 'em, Mikey.

833
01:12:08,128 --> 01:12:09,661
We got to find another way.

834
01:12:27,996 --> 01:12:29,330
M-4.

835
01:12:31,296 --> 01:12:33,630
I'm going to make
the call to QRF.

836
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,397
You ain't making no fucking comms
with that sat phone, Mikey.

837
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:38,063
Look at me.

838
01:12:39,296 --> 01:12:41,398
I'm going to make the call.

839
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:48,464
No. No, Mikey.

840
01:12:50,063 --> 01:12:51,631
No. Fuck that.

841
01:12:59,164 --> 01:13:02,133
No. No. Fuck that, Mikey.

842
01:13:02,863 --> 01:13:04,465
Take it. You fucking take it.

843
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,697
Mikey, give me the fucking...

844
01:13:23,831 --> 01:13:24,831
I'm sorry, Mike.

845
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:26,898
For what?

846
01:13:29,465 --> 01:13:31,224
That we haven't killed
more of these fuckers.

847
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:35,235
Oh, don't be fucking sorry. We're
gonna fucking kill way more of 'em.

848
01:13:36,865 --> 01:13:37,866
Fuck!

849
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:44,466
Marcus.

850
01:13:47,232 --> 01:13:48,967
Never out of the fight.

851
01:14:00,299 --> 01:14:01,801
What's he doing, Marcus?

852
01:14:02,632 --> 01:14:05,102
Murphy's moving!
Murphy's moving!

853
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,501
Where is he going?

854
01:14:23,968 --> 01:14:25,636
Oh, fuck!

855
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,135
Murphy's moving!

856
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:43,936
Oh, fuck.

857
01:14:53,234 --> 01:14:54,836
I am the Reaper.

858
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:07,503
Fuck.

859
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:19,271
Fucking A.

860
01:15:22,336 --> 01:15:23,503
Fuck!

861
01:16:08,973 --> 01:16:10,908
J- Bad TOC. Sergeant Hasslert.

862
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:14,976
This is Lieutenant Mike Murphy.
Spartan O-1.

863
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:17,240
We need immediate air support.

864
01:16:21,339 --> 01:16:22,473
We need help.

865
01:16:22,572 --> 01:16:27,144
We are heading down the ravine
towards the Chichal Village.

866
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,040
Roger that, Murphy.

867
01:16:29,273 --> 01:16:31,708
We need immediate CAS.

868
01:16:31,806 --> 01:16:34,042
Lieutenant, I need
your ten-digit grid.

869
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:35,473
Please hurry, sir.

870
01:16:35,539 --> 01:16:37,340
Murphy, I need those grids.
Thank you.

871
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:39,942
Oh, God.

872
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:41,173
Lieutenant.

873
01:16:41,406 --> 01:16:43,842
Lieutenant, can you hear me?
Lieutenant!

874
01:16:43,907 --> 01:16:45,975
Lieutenant, Get me the grids!

875
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,674
Lieutenant!

876
01:18:04,477 --> 01:18:08,648
Let's go, guys! Everybody,
let's move! Let's really move!

877
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,779
Let's go, let's go!

878
01:18:11,577 --> 01:18:13,446
Lulu 06, Bruno 6-4.

879
01:18:13,511 --> 01:18:16,247
Wheels up, Ba-gram,
with QRF of 1-6 Eagles.

880
01:18:18,979 --> 01:18:20,646
No go, no go!

881
01:18:21,644 --> 01:18:22,979
No go! You're grounded!

882
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:25,012
What's the fucking problem?

883
01:18:25,077 --> 01:18:27,848
These Black Hawks cannot
fly without Apache cover!

884
01:18:28,612 --> 01:18:30,613
Where are the fucking Apaches?

885
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:32,947
On their way back now.
They're turning around.

886
01:18:33,278 --> 01:18:34,947
This is fucking unbelievable!

887
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:36,011
No shit!

888
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,480
Sir, we are four Mikes
out from the zone.

889
01:18:40,545 --> 01:18:41,545
Four Mikes!

890
01:18:42,378 --> 01:18:44,047
Look alive, gentlemen.

891
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:49,117
Bruno 64 report Mike Bravo
plus five. Altimeter 2998.

892
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,414
Where's Mike?

893
01:19:12,313 --> 01:19:13,648
Where's Murphy?

894
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:15,448
Up top.

895
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:17,515
Where up top?

896
01:19:17,681 --> 01:19:18,748
He's getting the QRF.

897
01:19:23,247 --> 01:19:24,281
Where exactly is Mike?

898
01:19:24,414 --> 01:19:28,084
If I knew exactly where the fuck
he was, I would tell you, brother!

899
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:29,948
Is he squared away?

900
01:19:31,214 --> 01:19:33,115
Oh, fuck. Let me see you.

901
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:35,282
Oh.

902
01:19:36,214 --> 01:19:37,883
Motherfuckers.

903
01:19:39,348 --> 01:19:41,349
Did they really shoot
me in the fucking head?

904
01:19:42,682 --> 01:19:44,116
Yeah, buddy.

905
01:19:59,348 --> 01:20:01,684
Are Mikey and Danny
really dead?

906
01:20:04,316 --> 01:20:05,817
I don't know.

907
01:20:07,283 --> 01:20:08,684
Are we dead?

908
01:20:10,082 --> 01:20:11,284
Negative.

909
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:14,617
We're good, right?

910
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:15,784
Fuck, yeah.

911
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:17,751
We're solid.

912
01:20:23,116 --> 01:20:26,653
If I die, I need
you to make sure

913
01:20:26,717 --> 01:20:30,554
that Cindy knows how
much I love her.

914
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:31,651
She knows.

915
01:20:31,717 --> 01:20:34,052
And that I died
with my brothers

916
01:20:35,851 --> 01:20:37,686
with a full fucking heart.

917
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:44,252
You're not dying, Axe.
We're not gonna...

918
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,853
We gotta spread out. Get
yourself some real estate.

919
01:20:57,218 --> 01:20:58,452
64, be advised.

920
01:20:58,518 --> 01:21:01,921
Negative Apache support.
LZ is too hot. Stand down.

921
01:21:01,985 --> 01:21:03,052
What's the problem?

922
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:05,487
The Apaches were pulled.
We're grounded.

923
01:21:05,552 --> 01:21:06,586
Why?

924
01:21:06,652 --> 01:21:08,320
Some Army troops in contact.

925
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:09,986
They took our gunship support.

926
01:21:10,452 --> 01:21:12,654
Can you put us on the
ground without the Apaches?

927
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:14,020
We'll do what we have
to do to get you

928
01:21:14,085 --> 01:21:15,253
on the ground with your men.

929
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:16,953
Thank you.

930
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:20,389
Bruno 65, continue
030, we're still a go.

931
01:21:20,787 --> 01:21:21,953
Roger, 65.

932
01:21:22,019 --> 01:21:23,186
We're on our own. Stay tight.

933
01:21:25,385 --> 01:21:26,654
Axe?

934
01:21:35,386 --> 01:21:36,654
Axe?

935
01:21:55,688 --> 01:21:56,954
Commander, we're two Mikes out.

936
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,699
Get your men ready. Uh-huh.
Uh, Roger that.

937
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,723
Two Mikes! Two Mikes!

938
01:22:02,087 --> 01:22:03,422
Marcus!

939
01:22:03,887 --> 01:22:05,222
Marcus!

940
01:22:20,055 --> 01:22:21,289
Yeah!

941
01:22:23,455 --> 01:22:25,023
Bruno 64, two Mikes out. Go!

942
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:27,457
Gonna be a fast infill.
Establish over watch.

943
01:22:30,888 --> 01:22:32,458
Rope deployed and
on the ground.

944
01:22:32,523 --> 01:22:33,990
Whoo! Axe!

945
01:22:37,955 --> 01:22:39,122
Fast infill now.

946
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:42,560
Let's do this! Patton!
You're first! Move!

947
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:43,823
First team member on the rope.

948
01:22:46,523 --> 01:22:47,624
You good?

949
01:22:47,856 --> 01:22:49,490
Couldn't be more good!

950
01:22:53,691 --> 01:22:55,024
RPG! Fuck!

951
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:03,458
No.

952
01:23:03,624 --> 01:23:05,559
Fuck, throttle's off
throttle's off!

953
01:23:05,624 --> 01:23:07,559
Oh, shit, throttle's off!

954
01:23:07,624 --> 01:23:10,193
Brace for impact!
Brace for impact!

955
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:18,291
Fucking down!

956
01:23:18,358 --> 01:23:20,726
Mayday, mayday!
Bruno 64 is down.

957
01:23:20,791 --> 01:23:22,293
Duck!

958
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,958
Put us down! Put
us the fuck down!

959
01:23:28,192 --> 01:23:29,825
Put this fucking
helicopter down!

960
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:31,260
Stand the fuck
down, Lieutenant.

961
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,192
Wait!

962
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:36,726
Don't you fucking stop!
Come on!

963
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:38,960
Stand down, Lieutenant.
We're not going down there.

964
01:23:39,025 --> 01:23:40,427
Keep fucking firing!

965
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:41,726
We have a fallen angel.

966
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:44,228
64 is down hard.
Broke up on impact.

967
01:23:44,293 --> 01:23:46,161
LZ is too hot. We have
to break contact.

968
01:23:48,126 --> 01:23:49,293
No...

969
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:53,162
No, no, fucking no.

970
01:23:53,392 --> 01:23:54,627
Ah!

971
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:30,403
Razor 11 en route to crash site,
five Mikes out, rejoining QRF.

972
01:26:30,733 --> 01:26:33,735
06 copy, five Mikes out. Be
advised, AO is still hot.

973
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,534
Axe?

974
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,002
Oh, my God.

975
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,902
Fuck! Axe?

976
01:26:55,234 --> 01:26:56,568
Fuck.

977
01:27:47,836 --> 01:27:49,571
You see any movement?

978
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:51,405
I got nothing.

979
01:27:52,237 --> 01:27:56,407
O6, 11. Infrared negative.
Movement negative.

980
01:27:56,737 --> 01:27:58,405
Copy all, 11.

981
01:27:58,737 --> 01:28:02,574
06, we just hit fuel reserve.
We need to come off-station.

982
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,572
11 returning to base.

983
01:28:04,903 --> 01:28:06,406
Roger. Copy all.

984
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,775
Oh, fuck.

985
01:30:03,909 --> 01:30:05,177
Fuck.

986
01:31:13,946 --> 01:31:15,147
Fuck.

987
01:32:35,849 --> 01:32:38,118
No. No.

988
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:41,684
Stay back! Stay the fuck back!

989
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:43,349
Back up!

990
01:32:43,817 --> 01:32:45,150
Stay back.

991
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:49,418
I don't care. I fucking...

992
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,319
What the fuck is this?
Oh, fuck.

993
01:33:08,718 --> 01:33:10,351
I got this.

994
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,922
No. No. No.

995
01:34:17,387 --> 01:34:18,387
What?

996
01:34:21,086 --> 01:34:23,255
You... You know where
to find Americans?

997
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:24,955
America-yee.

998
01:34:30,554 --> 01:34:32,155
Show... Show me where we are.

999
01:34:39,755 --> 01:34:40,822
Are you sure? Yes.

1000
01:34:53,155 --> 01:34:54,222
Who's that?

1001
01:34:56,989 --> 01:34:59,156
Who's that? Who is that?

1002
01:34:59,222 --> 01:35:01,592
Who is that? Who is that?
Who is that?

1003
01:35:01,656 --> 01:35:04,692
You see? Do you see what I have?
I'll fucking kill you!

1004
01:35:04,989 --> 01:35:06,055
I will fucking kill you!

1005
01:35:06,323 --> 01:35:08,401
Is he... Is he Taliban? Is
he Taliban? Is he Taliban?

1006
01:35:10,489 --> 01:35:12,807
I will fucking kill you. I will
fucking kill you right now.

1007
01:35:14,857 --> 01:35:16,390
I know he fucking
knows something.

1008
01:35:16,456 --> 01:35:19,025
You tell him I will
fucking kill him.

1009
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:20,990
Look at me in my fucking eyes

1010
01:35:21,056 --> 01:35:23,592
and you ask me if you
think I give a fuck!

1011
01:35:23,657 --> 01:35:25,991
I don't care. I don't go
home, you don't go home.

1012
01:35:26,056 --> 01:35:27,090
You hear me?

1013
01:35:27,156 --> 01:35:29,158
I fucking kill you!
I kill you.

1014
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:35,059
Why do you help me?
Why do you help me?

1015
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:36,624
Do you help me?

1016
01:35:38,324 --> 01:35:39,525
Yes. Can I trust you?

1017
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,925
America-yee.

1018
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:43,758
Okay.

1019
01:35:45,157 --> 01:35:46,291
Okay.

1020
01:35:47,791 --> 01:35:50,894
There's an American base located
here. Give this to them.

1021
01:35:51,358 --> 01:35:53,159
Tell them where I am.
Tell them where I am.

1022
01:35:53,258 --> 01:35:54,559
America-yee. Okay?

1023
01:37:23,562 --> 01:37:26,865
No! No, no! No! Get
the fuck off me!

1024
01:37:30,062 --> 01:37:33,098
No! No! Fuck, no!

1025
01:37:39,429 --> 01:37:40,464
Fuck you!

1026
01:37:40,596 --> 01:37:41,830
Fuck you, America!

1027
01:37:42,696 --> 01:37:43,862
Cry, motherfucker!

1028
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:46,932
Fucking do it! Fucking
do it, you fuck! Huh?

1029
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:49,197
Fuck!

1030
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,598
Fuck! Fuck!

1031
01:37:51,697 --> 01:37:54,633
I'm gonna cut your head off and
send it to your fucking American...

1032
01:37:57,963 --> 01:37:58,997
Yeah, fuck you!

1033
01:38:47,931 --> 01:38:49,768
Why are you doing this for me?

1034
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:54,067
Fuck Taliban. Fuck Taliban.

1035
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:06,635
I need a knife.

1036
01:39:09,033 --> 01:39:10,468
A knife. Cut.

1037
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:12,001
Knife.

1038
01:39:12,667 --> 01:39:14,468
You know, knife? Cut.

1039
01:39:15,367 --> 01:39:17,368
Okay? Go get a knife.

1040
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,634
Knife.

1041
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:22,638
Yes! Yes, a knife, to cut.
Okay? Go.

1042
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:26,003
Go get me a knife.
Please? Please.

1043
01:39:45,101 --> 01:39:47,404
No, I... I said a knife.
That's not a knife.

1044
01:39:48,068 --> 01:39:49,169
Knife.

1045
01:39:49,435 --> 01:39:52,004
No. It's not a knife.
It's a fucking duck!

1046
01:39:52,669 --> 01:39:56,005
I need a knife. You know, knife?
To cut.

1047
01:39:56,269 --> 01:39:57,470
Knife.

1048
01:39:58,202 --> 01:39:59,536
That's not...

1049
01:39:59,735 --> 01:40:00,903
I need a knife.

1050
01:40:01,935 --> 01:40:03,704
A knife... You know, a knife?

1051
01:40:03,769 --> 01:40:04,970
Chaku.

1052
01:40:11,135 --> 01:40:12,338
Chaku?

1053
01:40:13,069 --> 01:40:15,105
Yes! Yes! Knife, yes!

1054
01:40:16,403 --> 01:40:17,670
No, no! No, no, no, no!

1055
01:40:18,203 --> 01:40:19,803
For my leg. Please.

1056
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:21,838
Give me the knife, for my leg.

1057
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:40,771
Fuck.

1058
01:44:27,748 --> 01:44:29,082
America-yee?

1059
01:44:30,881 --> 01:44:32,215
Texas.

1060
01:44:32,814 --> 01:44:34,215
America-yee?

1061
01:44:35,214 --> 01:44:37,383
Yes, Texas. America
is Texas, yes.

1062
01:44:37,848 --> 01:44:38,848
Tex.

1063
01:44:40,049 --> 01:44:41,316
Texas.

1064
01:44:41,714 --> 01:44:43,383
Texas.

1065
01:44:55,049 --> 01:44:56,317
Why are you doing this for me?

1066
01:45:09,383 --> 01:45:11,151
Sir, we have a verified letter

1067
01:45:11,216 --> 01:45:12,416
from Marcus Luttrell
seeking assistance.

01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:25,985
Put me everything in the air.
Yes, sir.

1072
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:27,451
Gentlemen, keep your lines free. Those
guys are busy at the other end.

1073
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:29,350

Tallying multiple hostiles.
Are we clear to engage?

1079
01:47:58,091 --> 01:48:00,026
Razor 12, you are
clear to engage.

1080
01:48:23,358 --> 01:48:25,593
Contact right! Contact right!

1081
01:48:25,925 --> 01:48:27,059
Two on the le Ft!

1082
01:48:29,025 --> 01:48:30,358
We're clear right!

1083
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,927
Halo 4-1. Visual red smoke.

1084
01:48:37,592 --> 01:48:39,927
Halo 4-2, you are
cleared for the zone.

1085
01:48:40,259 --> 01:48:42,861
Halo 4-2. Established low block.
On approach.

1086
01:48:44,492 --> 01:48:45,961
Ninety feet, 45 knots.

1087
01:48:46,392 --> 01:48:48,161
Clear forward. Down right.

1088
01:48:48,225 --> 01:48:49,860
Clear to the LZ.

1089
01:48:57,659 --> 01:48:58,660
Let's go. Move.

1090
01:48:59,593 --> 01:49:00,860
Go. Go, go, go, go.

1091
01:49:00,926 --> 01:49:02,093
There's an American!
In the door!

1092
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,294
What do you see?
What do you see?

1093
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,928
Any Americans?

1094
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:07,161
American? This way?

1095
01:49:07,226 --> 01:49:08,527
Go, go, right!

1096
01:49:12,094 --> 01:49:13,128
Go!

1097
01:49:13,927 --> 01:49:15,260
Let me see your hands!

1098
01:49:17,094 --> 01:49:18,595
Are you Marcus Luttrell?

1099
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:21,228
You're safe, Marcus.
You're going home.

1100
01:49:21,361 --> 01:49:22,395
Coming out!

1101
01:49:22,527 --> 01:49:24,896
Outside, walking him
out, coming outside.

1102
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,295
Here we go, all right, Marcus.

1103
01:49:27,261 --> 01:49:28,930
Hey, hey, watch yourself here!
Watch it!

1104
01:49:28,995 --> 01:49:30,261
Come on, we gotta go, we
gotta go. He comes with me.

1105
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,196
Sir. That's not going
to happen, sir.

1106
01:49:32,527 --> 01:49:34,428
You can stay here.
You'll be safe.

1107
01:49:34,494 --> 01:49:38,264
You can't come with us. These guys
will take care of you. You'll be safe.

1108
01:49:40,595 --> 01:49:41,929
Wait! Wait!

1109
01:49:42,728 --> 01:49:44,696
Thank you. Thank you!

1110
01:49:55,595 --> 01:49:57,463
Let's go, sir. We gotta go now.
Let's move.

1111
01:49:57,528 --> 01:49:59,463
Let's go! I'm sorry, Marcus,
we gotta move. Let's go.

1112
01:49:59,529 --> 01:50:00,529
Thank you.

1113
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:03,764
Let's go, we got to go!

1114
01:50:04,596 --> 01:50:07,398
Got him. He'll be fine.
I got you. Thank you.

1115
01:50:07,462 --> 01:50:09,531
Let's go! Let's move,
come on, here we go.

1116
01:50:09,629 --> 01:50:10,963
Come on, we're
wheels up in 30.

1117
01:50:11,064 --> 01:50:13,231
Come on, Marcus. Easy.

1118
01:50:14,997 --> 01:50:16,163
Here we go, Marcus.

1119
01:50:20,597 --> 01:50:23,098
Jackpot! Say again, jackpot!
We got him!

1120
01:50:39,865 --> 01:50:42,734
Patient upgraded to urgent
surgical. Prepare units of blood.

1121
01:50:46,798 --> 01:50:49,934
Multiple gunshot wounds
found on secondary survey.

1122
01:50:54,131 --> 01:50:56,800
Update ready to follow.
Say when ready to copy.

1123
01:50:59,298 --> 01:51:02,467
Brave men have fought and died
building the proud tradition

1124
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:05,801
and fear of reputation
that I am bound to uphold.

1125
01:51:14,465 --> 01:51:16,634
I died up on that Mountain.

1126
01:51:18,732 --> 01:51:20,233
No pulse. Okay, start CPR.

1127
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:21,768
One, two, three...

1128
01:51:22,366 --> 01:51:24,568
There is no question

1129
01:51:24,632 --> 01:51:27,969
a part of me will forever be
up on that Mountain, dead...

1130
01:51:28,165 --> 01:51:30,101
As my brothers died.

1131
01:51:31,266 --> 01:51:35,036
But there is a part of me that
lived because of my brothers.

1132
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,968
Because of them, I
am still alive.

1133
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:41,871
And I can never forget that
no matter how much it hurts,

1134
01:51:41,934 --> 01:51:45,002
how dark it gets, or
how far you fall...

1135
01:51:46,633 --> 01:51:48,769
Hey, Luttrell. Luttrell!

1136
01:51:55,901 --> 01:51:57,369
We got a pulse.

1137
01:51:57,634 --> 01:52:00,136
...you are never
out of the fight.
