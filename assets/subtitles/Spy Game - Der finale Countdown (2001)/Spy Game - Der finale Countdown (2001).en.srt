2
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,799
You got, maybe, seven minutes.

3
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:44,754
Six minutes.

4
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:12,882
Almost got one of the fuses fixed.

5
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:09,671
Thirty seconds.

6
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,053
Get out now.

7
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,993
It's Duncan.
What are you doing at home?

8
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,531
Jogging.

9
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,532
How long does it take you
to get to work?

10
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,863
- Harry, what time is it there?
- How long?

11
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,767
Thirty, forty minutes. Why?

12
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,339
I'll give you 25 minutes
before I transmit.

13
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,240
If you want to see the cable
before they do, you'd better hustle.

14
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,762
- Duncan.
- What the hell is going on, Harry?

15
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,204
Read the cable.

16
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:38,605
If I'm walking into a shit storm, I've got
to know which way the wind's blowing.

17
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,806
- Boy Scout is in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

18
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,276
Where are you calling from?

19
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,253
Are you in your car?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

20
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,449
He's a big boy.
He can take care of himself.

21
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,889
You call me from secure
when you get there.

22
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:53,209
Sorry, sir. You'll need to come
to the desk with me, please.

23
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,286
Mr. Muir.

24
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,723
Duty roster has you checking out tonight.

25
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:04,124
Just a reminder
On your way out,

26
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,357
we need you to sign
out your ID, card key, parking pass.

27
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,262
It's a date.

28
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:24,176
- You got a cable from Hong Kong?
- You check the Operations Center?

29
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:25,775
I go up there,

30
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:28,718
Nyland will want to collect that $100
I owe him from the 'Skins game.

31
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:33,953
Come on, Henry. Pull it off
the mainframe, will you? My last day.

32
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,275
Gladys.

33
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,924
Cubans are in the drawer on the left.

34
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:17,964
If these walls could talk, huh?
All this history, I envy you.

35
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,030
Well, bag your job.
You can be just like me.

36
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,869
No, really.
The debt this country owes you guys.

37
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,242
Chuck, Are we dancing all night with your hand on
my ass, or will you make your move?

38
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:34,206
- You used to ran an agent named Bishop.
- Tom Bishop. Yeah. How is he?

39
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,915
- We'd like to take a look at his files.
- You try Records?

40
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:41,514
Of course, we have his main files.
It was your personals.

41
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,195
- What do you want to know?
- We'll have Bishop reports downloaded sort in an hour.

42
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,823
That should give us all info we need.
For now, I'll just take your files.

43
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,069
Grab yourself a seat
and make yourself comfortable.

44
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,333
It will take me a while to dig them up.

45
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,569
Call my office as soon as
you have them. ASAP.

46
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,878
Muir, good luck with the retirement.

47
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:44,820
The director sent this down.
Actually looks like he signed it himself.

48
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:53,761
Harker said I'm supposed to collect
all your files on Tom Bishop.

49
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,843
Finally get to use
one of these burn bags.

50
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,377
Hold this till you hear otherwise.
You didn't see what I put in there.

51
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,578
Are we feeling a little paranoid
on our last day?

52
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,180
When did Noah build the Ark, Gladys?

53
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,519
Before the rain. Before the rain.

54
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,730
Hey, Billy, you got my $100?

55
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,778
Harker said to bring this file.
Can you buzz me through?

56
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,911
No, I can't, sir. I'll make sure he gets it.

57
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,076
As for the trade negotiations
in the Far East...

58
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,953
...a team of negotiators have been working
with the Chinese in an effort...

59
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:25,214
...to streamline proceedings of the groundworks, preparing
for the President's trip next week.

60
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,325
In other world news,
now that the Cold War is finally over...

61
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,994
...Berliners are proclaiming a new era,
here where Soviet and US tanks...

62
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:35,432
...faced each other
in the darkest days of the...

63
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,793
- Is this it?
- It's all I could find.

64
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,397
Packed, misplaced, you know how it is.
Moving day and all.

65
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:47,536
It's probably mostly up here anyway.
Old school, you know?

66
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,060
Muir

67
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,883
Step this way.

68
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,728
Sit down here, please, Mr. Muir.

69
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,459
Jesus, Aiken, how long has it been?

70
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,562
This task force have a name?

71
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,545
This is a tough one, Troy.

72
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,985
- I'm going to see you later.
- You got it, Cy.

73
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,933
Good to see you. Thanks for stop by.

74
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:48,564
For the record, we've been joined
by Nathan Muir, Near East ops.

75
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,265
We're in the process
of dealing with a fairly specific...

76
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:57,279
...international flap.

77
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,949
We brought you in here as a stopgap.

78
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,679
Fill in a few holes for us.

79
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,448
So, I'm like the little Dutch boy?

80
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,921
Yeah, we just need you to be
a team player on this one, Muir.

81
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,888
Why is that funny?

82
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:15,867
Every time my coach told me that,
I knew I was about to get benched.

83
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:20,998
Due to the nature of this task force,
there will be certain information...

84
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,443
...which you don't need to know.

85
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:27,078
A week ago,
Tom Bishop disappeared in Hong Kong.

86
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:29,580
Last night he turned up
outside Shanghai.

87
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:32,152
He's been arrested for espionage.

88
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,079
We're working up a complete profile
based on relevant personal histories...

89
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:38,817
...and op records.

90
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:41,851
This has to be handled with kid gloves.

91
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:44,726
How long does the President
have to claim him?

92
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,992
- Twenty-four hours.
- Starting when?

93
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,727
As of now, Nathan.

94
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,033
Bishop has been classified
as a common criminal...

95
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:58,943
...and will be executed at 8:00 am
tomorrow morning, our time.

96
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,473
What about the press?

97
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,917
Why not leak it and throw the spotlight
on China, and buy us some time?

98
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,855
We need the press on this
like we need a third tit.

99
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,693
You using the other two?

100
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:19,493
We don't want outside influences
to limit our options.

101
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,465
What was Bishop doing in China?

102
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,731
He was with an operation for Harry Duncan.

103
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,772
- Was?
- Yes.

104
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:28,898
Until he took matters
into his own hands.

105
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:32,209
- Where are they holding him?
- I'm sorry, Nathan.

106
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,281
It would be nice to know
what gaps are filled.

107
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:37,282
I've only got 10 fingers here.

108
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,848
Guess it's kind of tough timing.
A week before the President's road trip.

109
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,223
You guys afraid there's gonna be
a congressional hearing?

110
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,701
That's why we're transcribing
and videotaping, right?

111
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,975
Are you gonna want me to testify?

112
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:07,043
Absolutely not.

113
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,383
You met Bishop in Vietnam, right?

114
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:15,081
Yeah.

115
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,885
Spring of '75.

116
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:21,483
Hue had just fallen.
Danang would go in a couple of days.

117
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:24,723
And I had flown in country
to get an ARVIN sniper...

118
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,934
...who'd been with us
throughout the Phoenix program.

119
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,503
He was a heavy-hitter named Bihn.

120
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,600
I've got some bad news for you, sir.

121
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,931
- He's dead.
- Dead?

122
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,809
Just before dawn.
Caught a mortar round with his teeth.

123
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:12,277
Got anybody else?

124
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,438
There's a staff sergeant,
came away awhile back.

125
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,447
but he's
nowhere near Bihn's 40 confirmed.

126
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,608
- How many has he got?
- Three kills.

127
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,983
- Christ, and that's the best you've got?
- He's a fine shot, sir.

128
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,447
- Where is he?
- He's right over there.

129
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,819
- In the back?
- Yeah.

130
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,466
There is another guy, 20 kills,
but he's at least two days away.

131
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,125
- Confirm that for me.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,534
- Why is he over there?
- They live separate from the other men.

133
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:42,165
Cook their own food. Gook food.

134
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,072
The smell is awful, sir.

135
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,713
Not to the enemy.
Send him in.

136
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,511
Yes, sir.

137
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,326
Yes, sir?

138
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,953
- Bishop?
- That's correct, sir.

139
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:10,066
- Where are you from?
- Hemet, California, sir.

140
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:11,933
Here, have a seat.

141
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:18,644
You didn't get to be a marksman

142
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,145
putting food on your mama's table.

143
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,578
No, sir we have a Safeway back home.

144
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:27,246
- Where did you learn to shoot?
- Boy Scouts, sir.

145
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,424
- Are you kidding me?
- No, sir.

146
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:37,290
- When did you get pulled in?
- I volunteered, sir.

147
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,964
He came across as of those an idealistic type.

148
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,594
You know, a little bit of an attitude.

149
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,834
Starts out trying to see what he's
made of. Ends up not liking the view.

150
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:52,741
- Who was the target, Muir?
- General Hun Chea.

151
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:55,577
- He's Laotian?
- Yeah. Unofficial enemy.

152
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,582
Code name: Red Shirt.

153
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,950
He's responsible for the western flank
of the upcoming Saigon offensive.

154
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:02,779
- And his name is...
- Don't need a name, sir.

155
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:06,519
You don't need it or you don't want it?

156
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,752
Yeah, I'll do it, sir.

157
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,838
The target will be at a location...

158
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,540
...21 clicks away,
tomorrow morning at 0900.

159
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:34,352
It's a high-powered meet-and-greet
with the Vietcong.

160
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,463
- Will he be alone sir?
- He sometimes travels with a bit of an entourage.

161
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,293
"Bit of an entourage"?

162
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,136
Red Shirt located.

163
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:03,715
- Do you have in sight?
- Red Shirt confirmed.

164
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,254
Niner-eight-zero to gate.

165
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:19,965
One-zero-zero-five to table.

166
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,232
Wind:

167
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,570
Five miles left.

168
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:34,643
Target in sight.

169
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,854
Bravo Six, Bravo Six. Delta Two. Over.

170
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,726
- Go, Delta Two.
- We have target in sight, but no shot.

171
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:59,025
- Say it again?
- No shot. Helo's obstructing target over.

172
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,336
NVA doesn't have air support.

173
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:04,673
Position in jeopardy.
Our position is compromised. Over.

174
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,244
Say it again. Over.

175
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,344
- We're still a go.
- We have no go.

176
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:14,182
- Clear.
- Don't take the shot.

177
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,819
- See if you can get them back.
- Delta Two, Delta Two.

178
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:23,857
Move.

179
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:35,834
Come on.

180
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,963
Delta Two, Delta Two, Bravo Six, over.

181
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,784
Sorry about your men, Captain.

182
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:36,752
You want to make another pass, sir?

183
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,133
Hold it! Go back again!

184
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:11,128
Hell of an ad for the Boy Scouts.

185
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:19,537
Did you have a presidential finding
authorizing those kills?

186
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:27,979
I don't believe we've met.

187
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,175
- Who are you?
- Dr. William Byars.

188
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:32,912
National Security Council.

189
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:36,354
Was there a finding, Muir?

190
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:42,861
We were in a place
we weren't supposed to be...

191
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,954
...assassinating a general
from a country we weren't at war with.

192
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:48,227
Of course we weren't officially at war
with North Vietnam either but...

193
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,700
Is that a no?

194
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:52,931
Come on, guys. We're on the clock.

195
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,770
The President admits Bishop is ours,
denies he's a spy.

196
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,935
We put out the fires
and negotiate a deal.

197
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:00,342
Unless I'm missing something.

198
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,048
This'll just take a second.

199
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,849
Stop recording. Stop tape.

200
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:13,119
Your secretary's got your wife
on the line. She says it's urgent.

201
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:16,024
Go ahead. You want to take it outside?

202
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:19,463
No, I'll take it in here. That's fine.

203
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:25,226
Hello got your message.
You want me to start a fire yet?

204
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:27,033
Right.

205
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,005
This'll just take a second.

206
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,133
Right.

207
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:33,645
Tell you what.
Why don't you hold that reservation...

208
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,882
...and we may still be able to use it.

209
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:40,419
You might just. As we speak,
there are three guys

210
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:43,819
rummaging through everything
I spent a week packing.

211
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,928
If there were any instances
of personal dysfunction...

212
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:56,525
...emotional or psychological,
it could be helpful.

213
00:28:56,636 --> 00:28:58,627
- It's insubstantial.
- Right.

214
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:04,974
- Okay.
- A presidential finding of no importance.

215
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,602
- You still there?
- Yeah.

216
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:10,911
So he was an assassin, recruited to kill.

217
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:15,185
Sounds good. Bye-bye.

218
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,523
Sorry.
Wife's planning a retirement dinner.

219
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,425
"Assassin"?

220
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:36,868
- I think I just figured it out.
- The Bishop files.

221
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:40,377
- Where?
- My office. Closet.

222
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:43,916
- lt'll just take a second.
- I'll send a security officer down.

223
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:48,146
Harker you guys have better things to do
than to rummage through my office.

224
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,655
Right, Chuck?

225
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,426
He's on his way down.

226
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,560
You were right.

227
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,696
It rained.

228
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:44,742
- What about these?
- Burn them.

229
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:49,246
- What is this about?
- Money.

230
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:54,711
Free trade. Microchips. Toaster ovens.

231
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,789
And what does that
have to do with you?

232
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:02,284
Nothing.
Get me Digger Gibson's number.

233
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:07,530
Shit!

234
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,509
Agency's looking for a reason

235
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:22,012
to let the Chinese kill Tom Bishop.

236
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:51,572
They shut down my secure line.
Last day and all.

237
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,613
- Can I use yours?
- Well...

238
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:57,706
- I'm sorry, it's classified. Do you mind?
- Right.

239
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,863
So, sir, you and Muir
came up together, right?

240
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:21,434
- How well do you know him?
- No one knows Nathan, not really.

241
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,136
- Do you trust him?
- He's a man who got the job done.

242
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:29,375
Is he on the job now?
Office of Security, Hong Kong.

243
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:33,976
10 to 7 this morning, a call originated
from station to Muir's home.

244
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:38,285
- He knew about Bishop before he got here?
- He played dumb. This is Harker.

245
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,192
I need confirmation on all calls

246
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,161
in and out of Nathan Muir's office.

247
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,258
Gee, I'm hungry.

248
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,569
- Hong Kong Herald.
- Digger Gibson, please.

249
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:54,572
One moment, sir.

250
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:58,775
- Hello.
- Gibby, old boy.

251
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,108
Nathan! To what do I owe this honor?

252
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:03,204
You still have contacts at CNN?

253
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,215
- I got something for you.
- Talk to me.

254
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:09,084
How about, "CIA operative
caught in the act of espionage"?

255
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,453
- Can you get that on the air?
- That not won't be easy.

256
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,288
Come on, Gibby.
That's never stopped you before.

257
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:20,132
- Give me 30 minutes.
- Yeah.

258
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:29,063
I remember seeing something about
Bishop in my South American box...

259
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,609
...but it wasn't there.

260
00:33:31,712 --> 00:33:34,544
Those op files downloaded yet?

261
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,450
Let's go with this.
Bishop's recruitment.

262
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:44,786
Yeah. Well, back then,
recruitment took time.

263
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,792
Bishop was evacuated
with the last of them on 30th of April.

264
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,130
And that gave me a month
to do my homework.

265
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,463
I talked to his neighbors,
his teachers, his mom...

266
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,764
...scoutmaster.

267
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,739
I pulled his dad's record
from the Pentagon.

268
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:05,675
And then started to move some pieces
around the board.

269
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:10,010
And my plan was to
isolate and alienate.

270
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:18,285
And I had his C.O. give him
just menial duties...

271
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,586
...with non-English speaking
personnel.

272
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:24,185
And I kept him in limbo about even
the possibility of going home.

273
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:27,926
And then I watched and waited.

274
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,024
This consignment is a misdirect.

275
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:33,664
It needs to go to the military H.Q.
in Mannheim. You understand?

276
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,736
- Fuck.
- Then, in December...

277
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:43,077
...when I didn't think he could take
anymore, I made the move.

278
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,591
There she is!

279
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:06,767
Sorry, sir. It's Bishop.
Sergeant Bishop.

280
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:10,809
- Oh, Christ. Of course!
- Hi.

281
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,879
Sandy, this is Tom Bishop.
It's Tom, right?

282
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:15,209
- Yes, sir. Tom, sir.
- How are you?

283
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,339
- Sandy?
- My second wife.

284
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,939
Second wife?

285
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,883
He asked me why I was doing in Berlin,

286
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,649
and I said I was a military
liaison of sorts.

287
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,357
- It's good to hear an American voice again. I'll tell you that
- I'll bet.

288
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:32,229
- What are you doing for Christmas?
- No plans.

289
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,501
- Central Intelligence?
- Train you as an agent.

290
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,513
You'd be working for me,
mostly undercover.

291
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,511
- In Europe?
- Wherever the action is.

292
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:58,249
And if I preferred just to go home?

293
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,825
That's okay. It's fine.

294
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,519
I can probably make arrangements

295
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,597
for you to end your tour in San Diego.

296
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:07,928
In which case, I'll presume you'll forget
we ever had this conversation.

297
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,694
Look, it's your choice.

298
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,176
The next day,
we started his tradecraft.

299
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:20,178
Technology gets better every day,
and that's fine.

300
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,747
Most of the time,
all you need is a stick of gum,

301
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,510
a pocketknife and a smile.

302
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:25,778
That's disappointing.

303
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,814
Today we're going to be discussing
a radio set.

304
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:33,620
Not just any radio set,
but a Russian radio set.

305
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,289
Every building, every room,
every situation is a snapshot.

306
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:41,825
I'm sitting here talking to you, I'm also
checking the room,

307
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,926
memorizing it.
The people, what they're wearing.

308
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:47,403
Then I ask a question: "What's wrong with
this picture? Anything suspect?"

309
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:52,035
You got to see it, assess it, and then
dismiss most of it without looking without thinking.

310
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:54,238
- Without thinking?
- Just like breathing.

311
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:55,905
You breathe, don't you?

312
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:02,749
Always carry cigarettes and a lighter too.
It's a great icebreaker.

313
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:10,294
I want you to listen, but I want your concentration
to be on something different,

314
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,796
Anything else so you don't react. Understand?

315
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:18,694
- So when do I get my first assignment?
- When I decide you're ready.

316
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:21,102
- What is your name?
- Michael Sandville.

317
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,242
The suit in the kitchen.

318
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,941
- Threat?
- Wait, how'd you see that?

319
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,577
- See that apartment building?
- Yeah.

320
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:37,053
Know anyone who lives there?

321
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:40,388
Within five minutes, I want to see you
standing on one of those balconies.

322
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,417
Come on.

323
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,961
- Did you serve in Vietnam?

324
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,055
- No, I did not.
- Favourite colour?

325
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:49,033
- Why don't we discuss it over coffee?
- You just lost 10 seconds.

326
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,276
Solicit information from someone.

327
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,749
Gladly.

328
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:11,490
Guy reading the menu.
Don't look at him.

329
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:16,156
- He wasn't reading the menu.
- He's not reading at all. Threat?

330
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,892
Only to the hostess.

331
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:22,434
You gave her four pieces
of personal information...

332
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,162
...for one dubious, impersonal fact.

333
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,464
Just finding out
where she got that dress.

334
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:28,131
Where you from?
When's your birthday?

335
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,435
Come on you know everything about me.

336
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,805
I don't know a thing about you.

337
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,039
Ok What did you tell her?
1 You're straight. 2 You're engaged.

338
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,115
3 Tomorrow is your girl's birthday,

339
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:39,343
and 4 you have no taste
in women's fashion.

340
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:45,021
What if she were an asset? You told
her four lies that now have to be true.

341
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:15,283
- I thought spies drank martinis.
- Scotch. Never less than 12 years old.

342
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:16,376
Is that right?

343
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,515
Agency rules?

344
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,287
My rules.

345
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:25,790
So, what else?
What else do I need to know?

346
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:29,894
Put away some money
so you can die someplace warm.

347
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:34,035
And don't ever touch it.
Not for anyone, ever.

348
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:38,475
Is that it?

349
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,140
Don't ever risk your life
or your career for an asset.

350
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:49,220
If it comes down to you or them,
send flowers.

351
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,617
He was a natural.

352
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,093
He could take an East German
who'd just come over the wall...

353
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:59,926
...look him straight in the eye,
and ask him to go back...

354
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:02,160
...to the place
he'd just fled and spy for us.

355
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:12,176
He got so good at it, he could close
in an single afternoon

356
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:14,178
and send the poor guy out
with a smile on his face.

357
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,811
Let me get this straight. You allowed
a contract agent to develop assets?

358
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:22,046
He was that good.
I thought he'd be a fine case officer.

359
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:26,990
Let's get on with it. I'd like to hear whatever
you can offer about Operation Rodeo.

360
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:29,823
- "Rodeo"?
- The Cathcart affair?

361
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,463
Hold transcription. Hold tape.
I'll be right back.

362
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,792
This would go a lot faster guys
if you'd tell me little something about the op.

363
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:04,294
What's it called? "Sideshow"?

364
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:08,932
What about it?

365
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,560
How did you come buy to get this information?

366
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:15,937
Just stuff we learn in the field.

367
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:24,249
Sorry about that.
Okay, where were we?

368
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,810
I think we were talking
about Operation Rodeo. Right, Chuck?

369
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,687
You're on.

370
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:36,091
My East German contacts...

371
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:40,997
...discovered that we had
an unidentified mole in the embassy.

372
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,798
And we had the Ambassador
in our cross hairs...

373
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:47,702
...until some information leaked
when he was out the country.

374
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:50,502
So that just left one possibility.

375
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:53,510
- Ann!
- Hello.

376
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:56,104
- Ann Cathcart.
- Yeah.

377
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:59,379
Bishop was involved in a small
but integral part of the operation...

378
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:03,615
...going east to bring across an East
German functionary named Schmidt.

379
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:04,883
- Ready?
- Yeah.

380
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:19,731
Fuck!

381
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,240
Your passport is in the glove box.
Spill some vodka on your coat.

382
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,743
If they stop us, don't say a word.
Remember, you're drunk.

383
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:28,236
And where is Mrs. Muir?

384
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:31,044
Patricia left me, Ann.
She filed for divorce.

385
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,481
I'm so sorry, Nathan. How is it
I always say the wrong things?

386
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:38,955
Patricia?

387
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:41,290
Yeah, my third wife.

388
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,122
My God,
how many wives have you had?

389
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:48,564
Four. You want to hear
about them or Bishop?

390
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,501
- You see that gentleman?
- Yeah.

391
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:57,872
He's the Ambassador.
Why don't you go over there and say hello to him?

392
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,678
Your scotch is older than she is.

393
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:07,377
Am I supposed to feel bad about that?

394
00:43:15,662 --> 00:43:17,323
They know.

395
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,888
- They have my family already. I know it.
- They knew, they'd already have stopped us by now if so.

396
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,468
This time tomorrow, your wife and kids
will all be safe in Munich.

397
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,593
- Listen I got to make a stop.
- What?

398
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:28,332
A scheduled stop. It's okay.
Got to make a phone call.

399
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:29,908
They'll follow you. They'll hear you!

400
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:33,376
Frederick, it's all taken care of.
Ok If they ask, tell them I got sick.

401
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:46,852
Why don't we go outside?
I'm sure we won't be missed.

402
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,426
I wish I could.

403
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:51,426
I have to stay near the phone.

404
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:53,555
Working on a Saturday night?

405
00:44:03,676 --> 00:44:05,575
Are you bringing someone across?

406
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:37,707
- Yes?
- Vodka did me in, I'm coming home.

407
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,278
- Throw out the bottle.
- Repeat that?

408
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:41,414
- Throw out the bottle.
- They know.

409
00:44:41,415 --> 00:44:45,644
They don't fucking know. They'll be
waiting. Drop as close to checkpoint as possible.

410
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:49,519
- Negative. We're coming across.
- No! That's an order.

411
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:56,794
You have to let him go.

412
00:44:56,896 --> 00:44:58,796
They will kill him!

413
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:44,399
Let's go... just a couple of drunks.

414
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:25,111
Change of plans, Frederick.

415
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:36,222
You will drive me across,
just as you said.

416
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:39,890
If I do that, they'll kill us both.
This way we still have a chance.

417
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:43,901
You liar.
This way you still have a chance.

418
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,606
I can't help you.

419
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:51,370
- Just get out of the car.
- I will not get out of this car.

420
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:04,848
- Get out of the car!
- I will not get out!

421
00:47:06,392 --> 00:47:09,622
Please. My wife. My children.

422
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:11,390
I can't help you.

423
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:11,685
Nathan, what happened?
What went wrong?

424
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,725
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

425
00:48:14,493 --> 00:48:15,982
Actually, one thing.

426
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,122
Don't ever question me again. Ever.

427
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:21,164
- What?
- I give you an order, you take it.

428
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:24,964
You don't ask why. Those 10 seconds on
the phone could have blown the op.

429
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:28,267
- The op was bringing Schmidt across.
- The op was setting up Ann Cathcart.

430
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:29,897
And your end had to look legit.

431
00:48:32,444 --> 00:48:35,414
- What are you telling me Schmidt was bait?
- Yes.

432
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:37,606
Nathan, they executed him
on a shitty cellar floor!

433
00:48:37,716 --> 00:48:39,776
And it could have been you.
let me tell you about Schmidt...

434
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:41,852
...he went to the Russians a week ago
said he had a contact.

435
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:44,718
An American somebody he could use.

436
00:48:44,823 --> 00:48:48,954
Don't tell me that! Don't fucking tell me that! 
You didn't look in his eye! Don't tel me that!

437
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,493
He was an asset.
Don't tell me that!

438
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,588
He was your asset.
Somebody you used for information.

439
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:58,363
Jesus Christ! You just don't trade
these people like baseball cards!

440
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,906
- It's not a fucking game!
- Oh Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.

441
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:04,943
And it's no kid's
game, either, but a whole other game.

442
00:49:05,044 --> 00:49:08,410
And it's serious, and it's dangerous,
and it's not one you want to lose.

443
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:16,013
Nathan, we killed this man.

444
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:20,649
We used him, and we killed him.

445
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,126
Okay, You gotta help me understand this one.

446
00:49:23,229 --> 00:49:24,752
Nathan, what are we doing here?

447
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:27,492
Don't get me some bullshit
about the greater good.

448
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,089
That's exactly what it's about.

449
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:33,504
Because what we do is,

450
00:49:33,606 --> 00:49:35,470
unfortunately,
very very necessary.

451
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:39,600
If you not willing to sacrifice scum like Schmidt
for those that nothing only want their freedom...

452
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:43,671
...then you better take a long hard look
at your chosen profession my friend.

453
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:45,477
It doesn't get any easier.

454
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:47,881
You want to walk?

455
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,053
Walk.

456
00:49:57,162 --> 00:50:01,156
You should've told me about the op.
You used me.

457
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:03,461
I did. Listen to this,
because this is important.

458
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:05,968
If you'd pulled some stunt over there and
got nabbed,

459
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:08,006
I wouldn't come after you.

460
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:11,667
You go off the reservation,
I will not come after you.

461
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:22,042
- Fuck your rules, Nathan.
- Okay.

462
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:25,682
But tonight they saved your life.

463
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,381
Can we have the relevant files

464
00:50:55,488 --> 00:50:56,749
on Ann Cathcart, please?

465
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:07,528
Ann Cathcart's body was found...

466
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:11,796
...in the lobby of a cheap hotel
in East Germany...

467
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,872
...just two months after she defected.

468
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:22,142
Beaten to death.
Vopos never solved the case.

469
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:25,740
- Bishop was in Berlin when this happened. 
- We were both in Berlin.

470
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,184
Do you recall Bishop's reaction
to the news Ann Cathcart was dead?

471
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:36,624
Motive and opportunity.

472
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:41,359
Nathan you should leave here knowing that we're
looking into every possible scenario.

473
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:45,064
What's Sideshow?

474
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,167
You don't need to know.

475
00:51:52,211 --> 00:51:54,644
Why are you trying to burn Bishop?

476
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,419
Troy?

477
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:12,296
Hold transcription. Hold video.

478
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,993
Sideshow was a bugging op.

479
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,734
Listening to government offices
in eastern China.

480
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:26,140
The trade talks?

481
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:30,975
Did you afraid the lid of the cookie jar
is gonna shut on our hand?

482
00:52:31,082 --> 00:52:34,848
Come on, guys. The Chinese need trade
status more than we need to give it.

483
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:36,921
That's not necessarily so.

484
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:40,252
Twenty-four hours after capture,
Bishop is allowed to start talking.

485
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:44,921
That gives you 10, 12 hours to make a
trade. Now, come on, you're on the clock.

486
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,466
2:10 pm
EXECUTION 8:00 am

487
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:53,026
He doesn't know anything.
Bishop wasn't on Sideshow.

488
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,700
He wasn't working for us.

489
00:52:57,142 --> 00:53:00,669
He was arrested during a rescue
attempt at a prison

490
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,609
outside Su Chou.

491
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,044
Who was he after?

492
00:53:10,155 --> 00:53:11,553
Don't know.

493
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:15,990
Get off me!

494
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:33,135
For more on this late-breaking story,
we go live to Hong Kong.

495
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:38,178
It's just been confirmed that the
Chinese claim to have arrested...

496
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:40,751
...an American operative of the CIA.

497
00:53:40,852 --> 00:53:43,412
While the State Department remains
quiet, official sources say that...

498
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:46,548
...the individual, working out
of the American consulate in Hongkong...

499
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:48,923
...was captured in an act of espionage.

500
00:53:49,028 --> 00:53:52,225
If confirmed, this comes at a bad time
for an administration...

501
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,492
...which is in the middle of trade negotiations
with China.

502
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,535
The U.S. government is now in the process
of negotiating for his release.

503
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,434
We are so fucked.

504
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:02,665
...the situation as it develops.

505
00:54:02,774 --> 00:54:05,209
This is Frank Nall, live in Hong Kong.

506
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,801
Guess that limits our options.

507
00:54:09,615 --> 00:54:13,015
I want to know what you have to say
about this, and I want it on the record.

508
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:22,651
When I was a kid, I used to spend
summers on my uncle's farm.

509
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,959
He had this plow horse
that he used to work with every day.

510
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:29,193
And he really loved that plow horse.

511
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:31,097
One summer, she came up lame.

512
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:33,397
Could barely stand.

513
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:36,997
The vet offered to put her down.
You know what my uncle said?

514
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,144
No, Muir, what did he say?

515
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:46,115
Said "Why would I ask somebody else
to kill a horse that belonged to me?"

516
00:54:54,526 --> 00:54:57,051
Get me Peter Brody at the FCC.

517
00:54:57,162 --> 00:54:58,459
I don't care, just get him.

518
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,370
Looks like Bishop's gonna be okay.

519
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:07,729
Good.

520
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:12,303
What about the flag?

521
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,709
Keep it. You said to remember me by.

522
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:17,839
You know where to store this stuff right?

523
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,077
Yeah. What do I do with the storage key?

524
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,745
If I need it, I'll send for it.
Send you a postcard.

525
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:25,914
- From where?
- Not a chance.

526
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:29,084
You'd show up and try to clean the
place, and scare the native girls away.

527
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:30,593
I wish.

528
00:55:30,696 --> 00:55:33,859
I'll be working for Andy Unger
down the hall.

529
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,439
You're gonna miss it.

530
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:49,680
You know that, don't you?

531
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,267
Thank you.

532
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,165
Have a nice day. Thank you.

533
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:31,350
More on this late-breaking story,
we go live to Hong Kong.

534
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:35,888
In a late-breaking development
of the incident reported earlier...

535
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:39,986
...rumors that Tom Bishop,
an alleged CIA operative...

536
00:56:40,098 --> 00:56:44,035
...had been captured in an act of
espionage now appears to be a hoax.

537
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,729
Tom Bishop died 14 months ago.

538
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:48,932
While the CIA
has made no official comment...

539
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,533
...sources close to the Agency have
confirmed Bishop's death late last year.

540
00:56:52,644 --> 00:56:55,238
The credit of the story is interpreted to an overzealous
member of the Chinese government...

541
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,839
...who leaked the false information...

542
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,852
...in the hopes of undermining
the current U.S. trade negotiations.

543
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:05,050
This is Frank Nall, live in Hong Kong.

544
00:57:20,606 --> 00:57:22,004
Told you, you'd miss it.

545
00:57:23,008 --> 00:57:25,475
Who do you trust
in Military Intelligence?

546
00:57:25,577 --> 00:57:27,568
I co-signed Martha
Rayburn's car loan.

547
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,805
Listen, Gladys,
I got to buy some time here.

548
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:35,544
I'm gonna need the imagery analysis
for a military prison near Su Chou.

549
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:38,316
And if you use the phones,
don't use these.

550
00:57:38,423 --> 00:57:41,187
Any chance
I could lose my job over this?

551
00:57:43,629 --> 00:57:46,153
Good. I didn't want to work
for Andy Unger anyway.

552
00:57:58,276 --> 00:57:59,676
I know who it is.

553
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:04,906
I know who Bishop was after.

554
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,915
- Well, so do we.
- But do you know why?

555
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:16,160
If anybody knew the back-story,
I mean it would...

556
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,957
It would make a congressional hearing
really worth watching.

557
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,758
And, by the way,
that's not in the op reports.

558
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,975
Muir, you're not cleared to be in here.

559
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:41,211
Relax, if I didn't have clearance,
how did I get in?

560
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:43,685
Where's this report?
The skunk on the seventh floor

561
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:46,689
are pretty disappointed
it hasn't arrived yet.

562
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:48,258
Hold on.

563
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,425
What report?

564
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,022
Come on you were at the briefing this morning.
I'm talking about Tom Bishop.

565
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:57,297
Bishop went rogue.

566
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:00,470
They were gonna pull him out
until somebody up there...

567
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:03,370
...I'm not gonna say who, said that your dept.
claimed there weren't enough resources.

568
00:59:03,475 --> 00:59:05,204
Who said that?

569
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:09,539
Look I can buy some time
while you pull this thing together.

570
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:11,582
Now Operation Sideshow,

571
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,048
that's near the prison, right?

572
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:14,709
Near Su Chou.

573
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:18,120
China. Come on.

574
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,727
Any air support?

575
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,597
Shit, this is probably Folger.

576
00:59:32,504 --> 00:59:33,493
Yes.

577
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:40,066
Penghu Islands.

578
00:59:40,178 --> 00:59:44,410
Commander Wiley's outfit.
Forty minutes from Su Chou prison.

579
00:59:46,118 --> 00:59:47,517
Thank you.

580
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:51,577
Hey, I'm having a little retirement
dinner party tonight.

581
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:53,589
Services library. Say, 7:00?

582
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:56,524
Sure.

583
00:59:56,527 --> 00:59:58,185
You know, I didn't know you liked me.

584
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:19,309
What was that all about?
What did Muir want?

585
01:00:20,185 --> 01:00:21,584
We were just talking.

586
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:25,952
- What about?
- His party.

587
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,021
I don't think you're invited.

588
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:43,597
It's me.

589
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,707
Where are you?

590
01:00:46,812 --> 01:00:48,540
First floor coffee shop.

591
01:00:48,647 --> 01:00:50,705
Talk to me.

592
01:00:50,816 --> 01:00:52,180
Imagery Analysis.

593
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:55,946
They've got every angle on the prison
you could want, collecting dust.

594
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,680
Gladys, get me whatever they have.

595
01:00:57,789 --> 01:00:59,620
I'll have to go through Folger's office.

596
01:00:59,725 --> 01:01:03,388
I'm aware of that. I also need info on an outfit
of ours in the Penghu Islands.

597
01:01:03,495 --> 01:01:05,053
Commander Wiley's outfit.

598
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:08,691
Muir?
Muir, wait up!

599
01:01:12,604 --> 01:01:15,834
And call Kappler in the map room.
Tell him my party's canceled.

600
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:17,374
Your party?

601
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:26,109
We need you upstairs a bit longer.

602
01:01:26,218 --> 01:01:27,582
What's that?

603
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,314
I said we're gonna need you upstairs
a bit longer.

604
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:39,428
You've got something in your teeth.

605
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,602
Harker says you might care to
enlighten us on information...

606
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:54,644
...that's not in your op reports?

607
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:56,611
I just want to help out.

608
01:01:57,716 --> 01:01:59,546
Is it relevant to the issue at hand?

609
01:02:02,821 --> 01:02:04,651
I know who Bishop was after.

610
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:09,615
Elizabeth Hadley.

611
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,930
Pull up what we have on Hadley.

612
01:02:44,696 --> 01:02:47,926
Yeah, it was a tip-of-the-sword deal
out of Beirut.

613
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:52,935
Intended to be clean and efficient
in a place that was anything but.

614
01:02:53,037 --> 01:02:54,903
By '85, the place was a nightmare.

615
01:02:55,006 --> 01:02:59,943
BEIRUT '85

616
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:04,276
...the surrounding areas
into a new round of bitter fighting.

617
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:07,249
Sheik Salameh was our target.

618
01:03:07,352 --> 01:03:08,943
He ran a large terrorist faction

619
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:11,214
that had taken out
number of American targets,

620
01:03:11,323 --> 01:03:13,814
including at least one of the embassy bombings...

621
01:03:13,925 --> 01:03:16,086
...that left 212 people dead,

622
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:17,888
mostly civilians.

623
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,986
An assassination was not an option.

624
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,191
He needed to appear to die
of natural causes...

625
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,325
...to avoid violent repercussions
and even more bloodshed.

626
01:03:25,437 --> 01:03:26,926
His base of operations was Cyprus.

627
01:03:28,339 --> 01:03:31,832
What we knew about him was
extremely dangerous and extremely paranoid.

628
01:03:31,943 --> 01:03:35,401
He was planning a trip to Beirut
to see the family doctor.

629
01:03:37,515 --> 01:03:39,347
I sent Bishop in a couple of months
ahead of me to make contacts...

630
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:42,544
...and get within striking distance
of the sheik.

631
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,423
I set him up at the Commodore.

632
01:03:47,526 --> 01:03:49,720
You know, where all the flacks
and the expatriates stayed.

633
01:04:00,872 --> 01:04:03,169
His cover was as a photojournalist.
He's good

634
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:05,435
He was talented. Had a good eye.

635
01:04:05,544 --> 01:04:09,707
Probably had a photography merit
badge stuffed in a drawer at home.

636
01:04:11,249 --> 01:04:13,240
It wasn't that much different
from Nam, actually.

637
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,682
So it wasn't long
before he was right at home.

638
01:04:27,566 --> 01:04:29,055
It took him seven weeks...

639
01:04:33,104 --> 01:04:35,004
...but Bishop found a way
to get to the sheik.

640
01:04:35,774 --> 01:04:37,537
- Hi.
- Hi.

641
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:42,010
Thanks.

642
01:05:02,801 --> 01:05:05,531
Yeah, tobacco, see, cigarettes.

643
01:05:07,272 --> 01:05:10,707
It's for the children, for God's sake!

644
01:05:14,713 --> 01:05:16,111
Turn it off!

645
01:05:42,307 --> 01:05:43,671
Fine.

646
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:49,274
Okay, calm down. Calm down!
Come on, quiet, guys.

647
01:05:49,381 --> 01:05:53,783
Bishop delivered a consignment of
medical supplies to the refugee camp.

648
01:05:53,885 --> 01:05:57,013
He'd negotiated a deal
with a new contact in order to get closer

649
01:05:57,122 --> 01:05:58,952
to the sheik's doctor.

650
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:04,193
Take the antibiotics and the morphine
straight into the hospital.

651
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:08,192
The rest of the stuff, the hypos,
bandages, take it into storage, okay?

652
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,403
Fuck.

653
01:06:51,243 --> 01:06:53,035
What happened to the kid over here?

654
01:06:53,144 --> 01:06:54,667
He was trying to take The Hill.

655
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:56,906
It's in the north end of the camp.

656
01:06:57,015 --> 01:06:59,176
If they make it, they're clear in a safe zone...

657
01:06:59,283 --> 01:07:01,877
...where they can get
medical supplies and food.

658
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:05,481
Of course, they've got to make it back.

659
01:07:09,227 --> 01:07:11,923
There we go, honey.

660
01:07:20,271 --> 01:07:23,068
I'd like to come back
and do a story on the doc.

661
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:25,437
- I could get something published for you.
- For me?

662
01:07:26,745 --> 01:07:28,736
Let the world know
what's going on here.

663
01:07:28,847 --> 01:07:30,109
I don't know, Terry.

664
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,575
Maybe we can work something out.

665
01:07:47,765 --> 01:07:50,325
Bishop did a "day in the life"
spread on the doctor

666
01:07:50,435 --> 01:07:51,868
that got printed in the Times.

667
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,528
Why don't you take a look at it?

668
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:55,765
So with that relationship intact,
things looked good.

669
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:59,867
It's good.

670
01:07:59,977 --> 01:08:01,877
Then again, this was Beirut.

671
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,149
We didn't know when the doctor
would give the sheik his physical...

672
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:09,448
...but it was our one and
only opportunity to take him out.

673
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:12,022
I didn't have the usual time
to butter him up...

674
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:16,149
...which means we needed twice
the sex with half the foreplay.

675
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:21,923
- Hello?
- Muir has arrived.

676
01:08:22,032 --> 01:08:24,968
Can you get over here soon?

677
01:08:25,937 --> 01:08:27,905
- Right. Okay.
- Good.

678
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:39,174
All right.

679
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:43,175
Israeli troops moving in
to the Bekaa Valley.

680
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,447
- Where in the Bekaa?
- South end.

681
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:51,484
My God, it's 5:30. With the roadblocks,
you won't get there till noon.

682
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:53,655
Yeah, so the shots won't be so pretty.

683
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:19,983
All right, I'm up. What's so important?

684
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,490
It's a new day.

685
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:26,284
- It's far too early, you psycho. What is it?
- The Sheik Ali Salameh.

686
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,589
He's moving.

687
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:30,429
- How?
- Speedboat from Cyprus.

688
01:09:30,535 --> 01:09:32,832
He's booked the top floor of the
Nebaa apartments for two weeks.

689
01:09:49,187 --> 01:09:52,417
My God, you're hideous.
Why do you even bother?

690
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:54,423
I missed you, too.

691
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,287
You want flowers at 5:00 a.m.?

692
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:59,385
Flowers would be nice,
but I'll settle for breakfast.

693
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:01,294
I got a good spot.

694
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:02,798
Taught the guy to make migas.

695
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:07,599
Migas? A Mexican restaurant
in Beirut? I'm impressed.

696
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:16,210
Suddenly,
Mexican doesn't sound so good to me.

697
01:10:20,852 --> 01:10:22,911
Better be the best damn breakfast
I ever had.

698
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:24,249
Delicious. You'll love it.

699
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:26,255
First we have to get to the end of the alley.

700
01:10:26,357 --> 01:10:27,880
You're gonna make a beautiful corpse.

701
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:39,268
Happy birthday, Nathan.

702
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:50,380
You know, Langley has seven
different birth dates for you?

703
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:51,880
They're all wrong.

704
01:10:51,983 --> 01:10:55,749
I know believe me, it wasn't easy.
KGB, Mossad, also wrong.

705
01:10:55,853 --> 01:10:57,683
Fortunately, I was well-trained.

706
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,821
Tom, I'm speechless.

707
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:06,054
Where did you find something like this in Beirut?

708
01:11:06,164 --> 01:11:08,826
Beirut? Diplomatic pouch,
overnight from London.

709
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:11,231
Got a new racket going on here.
Operation Dinner Out.

710
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:13,701
"Dinner Out"?

711
01:11:15,907 --> 01:11:17,704
Dinner Out. I'll remember that.

712
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:39,627
Here we go.

713
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,780
How we doing?

714
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:01,009
The sheik's scheduled for a physical.
I made contact with his doctor,

715
01:12:01,118 --> 01:12:02,551
who's also his cousin.

716
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,644
Sounds right.
The doctor's name is Ahmad.

717
01:12:05,756 --> 01:12:07,816
He works
in a refugee camp south of town.

718
01:12:10,294 --> 01:12:12,125
I got to him through an aid worker.

719
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:13,959
Blonde or brunette?

720
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:17,492
- I didn't say he was a she.
- Is she cute?

721
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,469
Just someone
I used to get into the camp.

722
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:25,171
She gonna be any further use to us?

723
01:12:25,276 --> 01:12:27,800
Not to "us."

724
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,283
Another piece of nasty business.
Langley wants a backup.

725
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:48,866
They want me to liaise
with the Lebanese militia, just in case.

726
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:52,527
Nathan, those guys are cowboys.
No. Not an option.

727
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:56,437
All the more reason to make sure
we do it our way.

728
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:40,983
You're 10 minutes late.

729
01:13:41,085 --> 01:13:43,484
Nathan, we're okay. I just got hung up.

730
01:13:44,755 --> 01:13:47,689
- Look, we got zero room for error here.
- You're right.

731
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:50,157
You're right. Won't happen again.

732
01:13:54,432 --> 01:13:57,229
Good to see you.

733
01:13:57,335 --> 01:13:58,825
- How are you, sir?
- Great, thanks.

734
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,631
Listen I have a friend I think
you'd be interested in speaking with.

735
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:03,866
- You good on time?
- Yes Okay.

736
01:14:03,974 --> 01:14:05,374
Hello Doctor.

737
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:07,307
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks. May I?

738
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:08,639
Please.

739
01:14:10,615 --> 01:14:14,243
It's official business, I'm afraid I'm a bit unpleasant,
but something I think you ought to see.

740
01:14:18,956 --> 01:14:24,086
The doctor's father had been
a politician, a diplomat of some note...

741
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:28,598
...and he and his wife had died a couple of
years back from CO2 asphyxiation.

742
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:33,926
We have reason to believe that the death
of your parents was not accidental.

743
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:41,844
Are you saying they were murdered?

744
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:51,947
We know who did it. I wanted to give you
a chance if you want to do something about this.

745
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:55,218
Something I think would serve
both of our interests.

746
01:15:00,031 --> 01:15:01,862
I'm sorry.

747
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,947
It's like he wanted me to know.

748
01:15:21,051 --> 01:15:23,987
What I did know was
that if we weren't careful...

749
01:15:24,088 --> 01:15:28,421
...she was gonna cause the whole thing
to come crashing down around us.

750
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,563
Good, yeah.

751
01:15:38,669 --> 01:15:40,568
He's been with her every night.

752
01:16:06,731 --> 01:16:08,289
Scotch.

753
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,129
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

754
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:16,899
Excuse me, sir?

755
01:16:19,977 --> 01:16:21,773
You see the gentleman at the bar?

756
01:16:23,714 --> 01:16:26,876
Would you get him a double
of your cheapest scotch?

757
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,416
- Who is it?
- He's this guy

758
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:37,423
He works at the embassy. He
helped me out with a passport problem.

759
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:41,625
Excuse me. The gentleman here
offered you a scotch.

760
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:47,662
Good guy. A really good guy.

761
01:16:47,772 --> 01:16:50,366
- Terry? It's Terry, right?
- That's right.

762
01:16:50,474 --> 01:16:52,442
Good to see you again, Nathan.

763
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:55,136
I was saying how you helped me
with that passport problem.

764
01:16:55,246 --> 01:16:57,076
Elizabeth Hadley, Nathan Muir.

765
01:16:58,215 --> 01:17:00,683
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

766
01:17:00,785 --> 01:17:02,844
You probably don't know
he mentioned you at the embassy.

767
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:07,184
He said he'd met a beautiful girl
and wanted to extend his stay.

768
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:08,484
And is that's got to be you, right?

769
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:10,116
Well, you never know.

770
01:17:11,562 --> 01:17:13,723
- You want to join us?
- Well, Maybe just for a minute.

771
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:16,026
I don't want to be a third wheel.

772
01:17:17,701 --> 01:17:20,000
So what brings you to
this part of the world?

773
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:22,664
I'm with an international
aid organisation.

774
01:17:22,773 --> 01:17:25,741
How do you keep track of it all?

775
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:29,478
"It all"?

776
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:32,276
I haven't been here that long,
but it seems like nobody trusts anybody.

777
01:17:32,383 --> 01:17:34,850
Seventeen sects
all claiming their birthright here.

778
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:38,718
- Do you have a favourite?
- Our organisation is neutral.

779
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:42,090
God, that must be nice. Being neutral.

780
01:17:42,192 --> 01:17:45,651
Never having to take sides.
Sleeping like a baby.

781
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:48,390
- That's a simplistic way to look...
- Don't defend me.

782
01:17:48,499 --> 01:17:49,727
What?

783
01:17:49,834 --> 01:17:53,269
No, she's right, she's right.
So how do you sleep, Elizabeth?

784
01:17:53,371 --> 01:17:55,737
Actually, I don't.

785
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,366
It's the shelling. I can't quite get used
to it, you know. All night.

786
01:17:59,477 --> 01:18:03,607
More effective that way. Families at
home, greater chance of casualties, good business.

787
01:18:03,714 --> 01:18:08,377
Then quite a lot of these shells that seem to
come from the sea, from warships.

788
01:18:08,486 --> 01:18:10,817
Funny do know. Now that I think about it.

789
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,617
The bombs, the guns, the bullets, the tanks, they
all come from somewhere else, too.

790
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:19,594
China, Syria, Iraq, Iran, the U.S.

791
01:18:21,165 --> 01:18:24,692
This place is like 31 Flavors.
Something for everyone.

792
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,429
Bad day at the office, Nathan?

793
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:29,335
You're right. I apologize.

794
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,636
You're kind enough
to invite me to your table...

795
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:35,041
...and I start talking politics right off the bat.

796
01:18:35,146 --> 01:18:37,478
- I guess that's the curse of the job.
- Must be.

797
01:18:38,849 --> 01:18:41,477
So, Elizabeth, do you miss London?

798
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:47,751
It must be tough
not being able to return.

799
01:18:47,858 --> 01:18:50,018
- Why should does concern you.
- What are you talking about?

800
01:18:50,126 --> 01:18:53,220
I don't know if she's mentioned
that she's not welcome at home.

801
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,127
Her parents won't talk to her, her
brother and sisters think she's crazy.

802
01:18:57,835 --> 01:19:00,133
- She's a fanatic.
- Stop it.

803
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:03,603
This is ridiculous.
You just met this guy, right?

804
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:06,835
No, please don't.
Please stay with your friend.

805
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,841
Shit!

806
01:19:10,981 --> 01:19:14,039
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Exactly, What you should have done. Your homework.

807
01:19:14,051 --> 01:19:18,077
- Nathan, she set us up with Ahmad.
- Yeah? So she's just an asset?

808
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:21,180
Did it ever occur to you
she might see you as an asset?

809
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,192
Yes, it did, and I'm telling you,
you're wrong.

810
01:19:23,294 --> 01:19:25,420
How did you two meet?

811
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:27,929
Did you mark her,
or was it the other way around?

812
01:19:28,032 --> 01:19:29,862
Did she get you to do her
any favours?

813
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:32,764
Nathan, you're out of line.
Drop it. It's under control.

814
01:19:37,241 --> 01:19:41,768
How about him? Rajiq Nabih.
You got him under control? Hezbollah.

815
01:19:41,879 --> 01:19:46,542
She uses him to finance her camp,
and he uses her for God knows what.

816
01:19:48,018 --> 01:19:51,977
Now tell me I'm wrong, Tom.
Tell me you knew about him.

817
01:19:52,089 --> 01:19:54,283
I don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

818
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:57,155
My personal life is my business.
You stay out of it!

819
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:00,024
Like heck.
Sure, "Terry,"

820
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:02,625
I'll stay out of your personal life.

821
01:20:28,893 --> 01:20:30,826
Am I getting played here?

822
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:35,389
- Jesus, you're such a...
- Am I getting played?

823
01:20:35,499 --> 01:20:36,760
You accuse me of lying to you?

824
01:20:36,866 --> 01:20:39,027
- What is it?
- Do you want the truth?

825
01:20:40,804 --> 01:20:42,965
Well, fine. I'm a fixer. A fanatic.

826
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:45,063
How do you think I move so freely?

827
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:49,771
I make deals, provide introductions,
anything to try help the people I work with.

828
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,313
And as much as I'd like to deny it,
sometimes, most times...

829
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:54,474
...those introductions
have consequences.

830
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:57,586
Why can't you go home?

831
01:20:59,223 --> 01:21:00,484
Why can't you go home?

832
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,923
- Why?
- I...

833
01:21:03,027 --> 01:21:04,755
- Why?
- I was involved...

834
01:21:04,862 --> 01:21:07,228
...with a human rights group in London.

835
01:21:07,331 --> 01:21:09,231
We bombed a building owned by Chine government.

836
01:21:09,332 --> 01:21:11,233
It was supposed to be empty. It wasn't.

837
01:21:11,335 --> 01:21:14,429
And I have to live with that.

838
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:17,803
Fine. That's me. What about you?

839
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,277
You can start small. Your name.

840
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:23,777
You know my name.

841
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:28,817
- Your name.
- Terry.

842
01:21:28,919 --> 01:21:30,818
Tell me your real name, please.

843
01:21:32,755 --> 01:21:35,384
Jesus, you're pathetic.

844
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:49,403
She had worked both ends
against the middle for so long...

845
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:51,701
...the middle decided to give up
and go home.

846
01:21:51,808 --> 01:21:54,299
The Chinese, of course,
had serious problems with her.

847
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:57,005
A lot of little ones, one big one.

848
01:21:57,113 --> 01:22:00,310
The London bombings
claimed the life of the premier's nephew.

849
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,350
They don't forget that kind of thing.

850
01:22:02,452 --> 01:22:04,010
How well did you know Hadley?

851
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:08,252
Our paths crossed. That's about it.

852
01:22:08,358 --> 01:22:10,451
What was Bishop's reaction to all of this?

853
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,496
Didn't bring it up.
So, neither did I.

854
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:23,063
I'm gonna try to get us some work
in South America.

855
01:22:23,173 --> 01:22:25,197
You ever been to Argentina?

856
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:51,701
- You okay?
- Yes, I am okay.

857
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,826
Okay.

858
01:22:58,642 --> 01:23:01,611
Half a drop of this on the skin,
he'll be dead within 12 hours.

859
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:06,313
You will use this stethoscope.

860
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:09,249
You will take the cap off,
hold it to his chest to check his heart...

861
01:23:10,252 --> 01:23:11,276
...then place the cap back on.

862
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:12,818
Make sure don't brush up against it.

863
01:23:12,923 --> 01:23:14,389
- Got it?
- Yeah.

864
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:16,819
That's it.

865
01:23:22,532 --> 01:23:24,125
Tell me.

866
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:27,465
- Is it hard?
- Is what hard?

867
01:23:29,606 --> 01:23:31,005
To take a life?

868
01:23:48,058 --> 01:23:51,390
The sheik wants me to come at noon...

869
01:23:51,495 --> 01:23:52,893
...on Friday.

870
01:23:55,832 --> 01:23:58,267
Which was just four, long days away.

871
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,938
Intelligence showed us
that he was on the process of planning a major attack...

872
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,669
...on the civilian sector of West Beirut.

873
01:24:06,777 --> 01:24:10,736
We were on the clock,
and we knew this was our only chance.

874
01:24:10,848 --> 01:24:14,045
It was imperative
that everything went according to plan.

875
01:24:19,223 --> 01:24:20,621
Bishop baby-sat the doctor...

876
01:24:20,724 --> 01:24:23,920
...and the rest of us tried not to watch
the water boil.

877
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,292
And, to satisfy Langley,
I met with the Lebanese militia...

878
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,635
...who were more than just a little
excited about even the possibility...

879
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,175
...of putting their bomb squad
into action against the sheik...

880
01:24:41,277 --> 01:24:43,438
...in case the plan
with the doctor failed.

881
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:50,780
The militia was purely a backup.
Not a real option.

882
01:24:59,996 --> 01:25:01,589
And then there was the waiting.

883
01:25:03,066 --> 01:25:04,692
That's the worst part.

884
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:08,202
Gives you too much time
to consider, "What if? "

885
01:25:26,857 --> 01:25:28,323
My name is Tom.

886
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:08,928
And then on Thursday...

887
01:26:09,066 --> 01:26:12,296
...the day before the sheik's physical...

888
01:26:12,402 --> 01:26:15,098
...the Druze and the Party of God

889
01:26:15,205 --> 01:26:17,639
started a street war in South Beirut.

890
01:26:18,642 --> 01:26:23,170
The sheik got antsy,
and the water boiled over.

891
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,304
- Tom Bishop on the phone.
- Yeah?

892
01:26:25,415 --> 01:26:27,143
The sheik wants him there
within the hour.

893
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:30,014
- Here we go.
- Nathan, the doc is not with me.

894
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,313
Where the hell is he?

895
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,854
The Amal retaliated,
gets the palestinian and shell the camp.

896
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:35,514
- You let him go?
- Nathan!

897
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,889
- You let her take him?
- Nathan I'm on my way now.

898
01:26:37,995 --> 01:26:39,929
The Lebanese militia isn't an option.

899
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:42,191
If the sheik gets away,
we're dead in the water.

900
01:26:42,299 --> 01:26:45,131
No, I can get him there! Just trust me.

901
01:26:46,103 --> 01:26:47,866
Get out of the way!

902
01:27:47,798 --> 01:27:51,233
Ahmad, it's time.
I'm sorry, we've got to go now.

903
01:28:12,522 --> 01:28:13,988
Fuck! Move!

904
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:33,103
- Hello.
- It's Muir. Where are we?

905
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:35,201
Looks like they're packing up to go.

906
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,048
Move!

907
01:28:47,124 --> 01:28:48,385
And?

908
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:50,722
Could be an hour, or 10 minutes.

909
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:31,992
Get out of the way!

910
01:29:32,102 --> 01:29:34,399
Ahmad! Go! Move!

911
01:29:34,504 --> 01:29:36,665
Get out of the way!

912
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:46,974
Hello.

913
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:31,852
Okay, good luck, Ahmad.

914
01:30:33,463 --> 01:30:35,259
- Ahmad, we got to go. You okay?
- Yes.

915
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,259
Thank you.

916
01:34:05,008 --> 01:34:09,444
The destruction was a little more
extensive than anyone anticipated.

917
01:34:09,545 --> 01:34:12,241
Our Lebanese friends were just a little insecure

918
01:34:12,349 --> 01:34:13,975
about this being their first big mission.

919
01:34:14,084 --> 01:34:17,746
So they packed the car with enough
Semtex to blow up half of Beirut.

920
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:58,358
It was a tough deal,
but I figured Bishop could handle it.

921
01:35:35,732 --> 01:35:37,791
I didn't see him again until a week later...

922
01:35:37,901 --> 01:35:40,095
...when we were scheduled
to fly out of there to Karachi.

923
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:46,338
That was the last time I saw him.

924
01:35:56,819 --> 01:35:58,447
Happy?

925
01:35:58,554 --> 01:36:01,250
74 casualties,
an entire apartment block leveled...

926
01:36:01,357 --> 01:36:03,018
...one dead terrorist.

927
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:04,558
Yeah, happy.

928
01:36:05,527 --> 01:36:08,429
We have some fucked-up barometer
for success, don't we?

929
01:36:11,401 --> 01:36:13,392
Let's take a walk.

930
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:39,250
I'm not going with you.
I hooked up with another op.

931
01:36:43,899 --> 01:36:45,799
Probably for the best.

932
01:36:50,974 --> 01:36:52,872
Is this about her?

933
01:36:56,713 --> 01:36:58,942
Make sure you're doing it
for the right reasons, Tom.

934
01:36:59,048 --> 01:37:02,448
Yeah, I'm done with your reasons,

935
01:37:02,551 --> 01:37:06,215
Nathan. I'm done with you.
I'm not ending up like you.

936
01:37:14,531 --> 01:37:15,964
Good luck.

937
01:37:17,567 --> 01:37:18,965
Good luck.

938
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:53,335
Lizzy?

939
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:30,839
Yes?
I'm on my way.

940
01:38:31,941 --> 01:38:33,567
I'm going to brief the White House.

941
01:38:33,675 --> 01:38:37,475
We'll finish this up at 0700 tomorrow.

942
01:38:41,584 --> 01:38:45,451
- The files you requested, sir.
- Thank you.

943
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:55,559
Wait! You can't go in there!

944
01:38:57,966 --> 01:39:00,731
I'll get back to you.
It's all right.

945
01:39:03,339 --> 01:39:07,104
- You can't do this.
- I'm due at the White House.

946
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:08,541
He's one of ours.

947
01:39:09,978 --> 01:39:12,139
Troy?

948
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:17,147
Do you remember when we could tell
the good guys from the bad guys?

949
01:39:19,088 --> 01:39:23,581
All this...
was about something, wasn't it?

950
01:39:25,694 --> 01:39:27,389
Yes.

951
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:36,001
5:42 pm

952
01:39:48,084 --> 01:39:49,448
Yeah, yeah.

953
01:39:50,118 --> 01:39:52,951
Forgot my smokes.

954
01:39:53,055 --> 01:39:54,045
I'll get them, sir.

955
01:40:10,273 --> 01:40:14,004
You're aware
this is now a non-smoking facility, sir?

956
01:40:14,109 --> 01:40:16,169
Feels good to break a rule now and then.

957
01:41:49,772 --> 01:41:51,763
Good morning. Thomas Quinn.

958
01:41:51,874 --> 01:41:55,036
- Mitch Alford, please. Nathan Muir.
- One moment, please.

959
01:41:55,143 --> 01:41:59,080
Mitch, I got Nathan Muir on the line.
Do you want to take it? Thanks.

960
01:41:59,182 --> 01:42:00,944
Hey, Nathan, what can I do for you?

961
01:42:05,487 --> 01:42:06,955
Who's this?

962
01:42:09,591 --> 01:42:13,255
- She was his wife.
- This guy and his fucking wives.

963
01:42:13,362 --> 01:42:15,921
She stayed in Korea while he did
two tours in South America.

964
01:42:16,032 --> 01:42:19,000
His second op with Harry Duncan
was real sensitive shit.

965
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:23,366
Muir worked with Duncan?

966
01:42:23,472 --> 01:42:25,736
Bishop worked for both of them.

967
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:27,536
Liquidate everything, Mitch.

968
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:30,111
Stocks, T- bills, money markets,
the works.

969
01:42:30,213 --> 01:42:32,875
- Should we let's discuss this.
- No. I don't care about penalties.

970
01:42:32,982 --> 01:42:36,611
- I don't have access to it now.
- Nathan, "save for a rainy day"?

971
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,084
I know what I'm doing.

972
01:42:38,187 --> 01:42:40,746
Wire- transfer the balance
to this account:

973
01:42:40,857 --> 01:42:44,759
1-7-1-2-4-4-8-2-9-2.

974
01:42:44,861 --> 01:42:48,125
- First Maritime of Grand Cayman.
- Grand Cayman?

975
01:42:48,231 --> 01:42:49,789
That's it. Thanks, Mitch.

976
01:42:52,234 --> 01:42:52,893
This is Harker.

977
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:56,095
I need to find out if there were any calls
made to Hong Kong since this morning.

978
01:42:56,205 --> 01:42:59,072
The whole building.

979
01:43:05,214 --> 01:43:06,305
- Hi.
- Hi there.

980
01:43:06,415 --> 01:43:08,383
I mislaid my pass.

981
01:43:09,518 --> 01:43:11,041
- I'll look upstairs.
- No problem.

982
01:43:11,152 --> 01:43:13,518
Get a load of this.

983
01:43:14,456 --> 01:43:15,424
What?

984
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,514
He consolidated
his international trading account.

985
01:43:18,827 --> 01:43:20,692
He did what?

986
01:43:20,795 --> 01:43:22,388
Sent them to a bank in Grand Cayman.

987
01:43:25,468 --> 01:43:28,368
- Get me his account balance.
- Right.

988
01:43:38,347 --> 01:43:40,474
- Yeah?
- Harry? It's Muir.

989
01:43:40,582 --> 01:43:43,813
Here's the list of the Hong Kong calls
you requested.

990
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,216
Embassy.

991
01:43:47,023 --> 01:43:48,819
That's his cell phone.

992
01:43:48,924 --> 01:43:51,085
Hong Kong Herald.

993
01:43:53,296 --> 01:43:55,560
That's Andrew Unger's fucking office.

994
01:43:55,665 --> 01:43:59,430
You still have contact with that official
at the power company?

995
01:43:59,535 --> 01:44:01,264
Yeah. Yeah, Deng. Why?

996
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:04,532
Yeah, this is Harker.
I'll hold.

997
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:09,377
Where can I fax you
that's under the radar?

998
01:44:09,478 --> 01:44:11,844
Kowloon Marriott.

999
01:44:11,947 --> 01:44:14,473
Look, what the hell's going on here, Muir?

1000
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:17,813
- You got to trust me on this, Harry.
- And why should I trust you?

1001
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,444
Jesus you recommended Boy Scout
to me in the first place.

1002
01:44:20,555 --> 01:44:22,318
Call me on my cell.

1003
01:44:34,903 --> 01:44:37,532
- What's going on, Unger?
- I'm looking for my badge.

1004
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:38,504
I don't understand. It's always...

1005
01:44:38,607 --> 01:44:41,166
11:03pm

1006
01:44:54,122 --> 01:44:57,319
- Where's Muir?
- Looks like he's gone for the day, sir.

1007
01:44:57,425 --> 01:44:58,791
What?

1008
01:44:59,829 --> 01:45:01,888
How much longer?

1009
01:45:01,997 --> 01:45:03,727
Print them out and send them up.

1010
01:45:12,008 --> 01:45:13,532
- Yeah.
- What now?

1011
01:45:13,642 --> 01:45:15,200
Did you get my fax?

1012
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:18,803
Yes. I see an op
requiring three months of prep.

1013
01:45:18,914 --> 01:45:21,143
Bishop prepped it
before he piggybacked Sideshow.

1014
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:24,947
So, what, we gonna ask him for help?
He's gonna be dead in six hours.

1015
01:45:25,054 --> 01:45:27,715
He's got a friend on the inside.
Check the roster for Sideshow.

1016
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:31,622
Well, I'll be damned.
Tran.

1017
01:45:31,727 --> 01:45:33,388
He's got all the schematics
for the prison.

1018
01:45:33,496 --> 01:45:35,259
So what do we need Deng for?

1019
01:45:35,363 --> 01:45:37,594
Thirty minutes to complete blackout
at Su Chou.

1020
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,667
- And, Harry?
- Yeah.

1021
01:45:39,768 --> 01:45:41,964
Get me bottom dollar.

1022
01:47:27,809 --> 01:47:28,834
Yeah.

1023
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:32,140
Deng wants 500,000 yuan

1024
01:47:32,247 --> 01:47:36,377
- for the power-out in Su Chou.
- No way.

1025
01:47:36,484 --> 01:47:39,385
Tell him $100K, and I'll pay in dollars.

1026
01:47:49,197 --> 01:47:53,191
Well, he won't risk it for less
than $300,000, but he will take dollars.

1027
01:47:54,335 --> 01:47:56,599
Five years ago,
it would have cost $20,000.

1028
01:47:56,705 --> 01:47:58,899
Five years ago,

1029
01:47:59,008 --> 01:48:02,408
Deng wouldn't have had to bribe
ten employees, two supervisors...

1030
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:04,944
...a local politician,

1031
01:48:05,046 --> 01:48:08,675
all of whom stand
to lose their lives if they get caught.

1032
01:48:11,152 --> 01:48:14,611
Come on, Muir,
it's not like it was your money.

1033
01:48:19,027 --> 01:48:22,519
Tell him $282,000 in a Grand Cayman
account, and that's it.

1034
01:48:46,487 --> 01:48:48,786
Okay, it's a done deal.

1035
01:49:00,603 --> 01:49:02,036
Good morning, Gladys.

1036
01:49:02,136 --> 01:49:04,866
If the wife calls, tell her I'll be upstairs.

1037
01:49:17,018 --> 01:49:19,350
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Director Wilson.

1038
01:49:19,455 --> 01:49:21,752
Good morning.
Have a seat.

1039
01:49:23,826 --> 01:49:25,759
I found some extra stuff on Bishop.

1040
01:49:28,863 --> 01:49:31,526
I don't think it's relevant,
but if you want to see it...

1041
01:49:33,001 --> 01:49:34,799
Harker, you want to go ahead?

1042
01:49:38,773 --> 01:49:41,402
There are a couple of things
that need to be cleared up.

1043
01:49:42,478 --> 01:49:44,639
- About Bishop?
- No, about you, Muir.

1044
01:49:44,746 --> 01:49:46,407
About the past 24 hours.

1045
01:49:48,049 --> 01:49:52,183
Mr. Muir has been working against us
from the start.

1046
01:49:52,287 --> 01:49:55,849
What are you talking about?
I've done nothing but cooperate.

1047
01:49:55,957 --> 01:49:58,255
Cooperate?

1048
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:00,850
Have I withheld anything?

1049
01:50:00,963 --> 01:50:03,625
Certainly the fact that Harry Duncan
tipped you off to Bishop's situation...

1050
01:50:03,732 --> 01:50:06,666
...before you even arrived here yesterday.

1051
01:50:06,768 --> 01:50:10,670
Yet you chose to play dumb
with us. Why?

1052
01:50:14,809 --> 01:50:17,300
Then maybe you'd like to tell us
about the calls you placed to Duncan...

1053
01:50:17,412 --> 01:50:19,847
...from Andrew Unger's office last night.

1054
01:50:19,947 --> 01:50:22,416
- Harry Duncan's a friend.
- Aren't they all?

1055
01:50:22,518 --> 01:50:25,612
- We were discussing a personal matter.
- Harry Duncan's gone missing.

1056
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,849
Well yeah, good for Harry.
He deserves some time away.

1057
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:31,858
With your $282,000?

1058
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:37,594
Muir transferred that amount
to a Grand Cayman account yesterday.

1059
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:40,259
As of an hour ago, it's gone.

1060
01:50:42,938 --> 01:50:45,429
You want to accuse me of something?

1061
01:50:45,541 --> 01:50:46,906
Accuse me.

1062
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:52,442
Maybe the payoff went to Digby Gibson

1063
01:50:52,548 --> 01:50:54,447
when you tipped off the press.

1064
01:50:54,549 --> 01:50:57,713
- Troy?
- Leave Digger out of this.

1065
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:01,384
His paper is a front.
He's Ml6's man in Hong Kong.

1066
01:51:04,058 --> 01:51:05,389
Anything else, Harker?

1067
01:51:07,196 --> 01:51:09,720
Yes, sir. Yesterday, lmagery Analysis

1068
01:51:09,831 --> 01:51:12,733
delivered a file requested by Muir's
secretary to your office.

1069
01:51:12,835 --> 01:51:14,666
Did you receive that file, sir?

1070
01:51:17,039 --> 01:51:21,475
- I don't remember seeing it.
- It was returned at 0300 this morning.

1071
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:25,308
All right, give it to me.

1072
01:51:28,517 --> 01:51:29,541
Thank you.

1073
01:51:40,094 --> 01:51:41,687
Is this China?

1074
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:47,158
Muir?

1075
01:51:51,974 --> 01:51:54,499
I believe it is, sir,
and I think it would behoove Mr. Muir...

1076
01:51:54,609 --> 01:51:58,443
...to tell us exactly what $282,000
has bought him there.

1077
01:52:00,048 --> 01:52:00,946
Muir?

1078
01:52:07,289 --> 01:52:09,586
It's kind of difficult to explain.

1079
01:52:12,728 --> 01:52:15,161
I think you'd better tell us everything.

1080
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:22,032
I've been using company resources
for personal benefit.

1081
01:52:25,706 --> 01:52:27,867
For the past year,
I've been routing one of our satellites...

1082
01:52:27,975 --> 01:52:31,809
...over some retirement property
that I'm thinking about buying.

1083
01:52:38,687 --> 01:52:41,814
What the hell is that?
Harker, let me see that.

1084
01:52:43,391 --> 01:52:48,253
Because of the changing weather patterns
and the erosion occurring along the coastline of the beaches

1085
01:52:49,798 --> 01:52:52,358
and the fact that it's my life savings...

1086
01:52:54,902 --> 01:52:57,599
...I just wanted to be sure.

1087
01:52:57,706 --> 01:52:59,434
Sorry.

1088
01:53:01,742 --> 01:53:04,268
I believe I'll sit in for the rest of this.

1089
01:53:06,648 --> 01:53:09,707
Aiken, where did you leave off
yesterday?

1090
01:53:09,817 --> 01:53:11,080
Beirut, sir.

1091
01:53:11,185 --> 01:53:14,383
We still don't know how Hadley
wound up in a Chinese prison.

1092
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:17,286
Should we go off the record with this?

1093
01:53:17,392 --> 01:53:20,156
No, let's just get on with this.

1094
01:53:21,763 --> 01:53:23,822
After the bombing,

1095
01:53:23,932 --> 01:53:25,899
Hadley was a concern,

1096
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,459
not only to Middle East ops
but to Bishop's life.

1097
01:53:29,571 --> 01:53:32,835
So, I brokered a trade
with the Chinese government...

1098
01:53:32,941 --> 01:53:37,344
...using Hadley in exchange for a U.S.
diplomat convicted of espionage.

1099
01:53:43,818 --> 01:53:47,948
And she was flown to a high-security
prison near Su Chou, eastern China.

1100
01:53:54,563 --> 01:53:57,497
Her place was cleared out
and a Dear John letter retrieved...

1101
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:00,090
...they were through was forged
and left for Bishop to find.

1102
01:54:06,942 --> 01:54:10,206
It appears you underestimated
Bishop's feelings for her.

1103
01:54:15,817 --> 01:54:19,446
Yeah, I underestimated.

1104
01:54:19,521 --> 01:54:23,651
And you took it upon yourself to do
this deal, and you were alone in this?

1105
01:54:29,063 --> 01:54:31,930
Yeah. Just me.

1106
01:54:40,808 --> 01:54:42,504
Muir's secretary is on the phone.

1107
01:54:45,981 --> 01:54:48,710
Your secretary's on the phone. Line 1 .

1108
01:54:57,858 --> 01:54:59,759
- Yeah?
- I've got Commander Wiley.

1109
01:55:02,097 --> 01:55:03,563
Okay, connect us.

1110
01:55:05,933 --> 01:55:09,893
Commander Wiley, sir. Package
received. What's the verdict?

1111
01:55:10,539 --> 01:55:13,030
- We're on for tonight.
- Roger, sir, I understand.

1112
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:16,234
Operation Dinner Out is a go. Confirm?

1113
01:55:16,344 --> 01:55:19,280
Correct. Dinner Out is a go.

1114
01:55:20,349 --> 01:55:21,576
Thumbs up!

1115
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:28,849
"Dinner out is a go"?
Hell of a way to speak to your wife.

1116
01:55:30,692 --> 01:55:32,785
Why do you think
they keep dumping him?

1117
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:55,347
How did Bishop
find out where she was?

1118
01:55:56,751 --> 01:55:59,585
Couldn't have been too hard.

1119
01:55:59,688 --> 01:56:01,849
Small world, people talk.

1120
01:56:01,956 --> 01:56:04,618
A white face
in a Chinese prison stands out.

1121
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,688
He's well-trained.

1122
01:56:09,831 --> 01:56:11,856
I should've known he'd find out.

1123
01:56:15,504 --> 01:56:17,938
- Any other questions?
- Yeah, one.

1124
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:20,872
If you'd known he was going after her,
would you have told us?

1125
01:57:20,035 --> 01:57:23,402
Do we edit the transcript or let it stand?

1126
01:57:23,505 --> 01:57:27,532
The Agency can't be responsible for
some crazy thing Bishop did on his own.

1127
01:57:35,015 --> 01:57:37,746
I'm sorry about Bishop.

1128
01:57:38,886 --> 01:57:40,514
So am I.

1129
01:57:41,622 --> 01:57:43,817
- We done here?
- Non-disclosure agreement.

1130
01:57:47,963 --> 01:57:49,554
Aren't you gonna read it?

1131
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:54,759
- Read it 1,000 times.
- Aiken,

1132
01:57:54,870 --> 01:57:59,636
would you escort Mr. Muir
from the building?

1133
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:17,316
- Dinner with his wife?
- Sir.

1134
01:59:17,419 --> 01:59:18,407
Why?

1135
01:59:19,787 --> 01:59:22,416
- He said he had four wives.
- I'm changing phones.

1136
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:27,349
- There was one in Germany.
- His first wife was Korean.

1137
01:59:27,461 --> 01:59:30,362
- And Peggy. That's three.
- He was only married once.

1138
01:59:51,286 --> 01:59:54,350
This is Blackhawk 1.
We're inbound.

1139
01:59:54,356 --> 01:59:57,815
- Operation Dinner Out accomplished.
- What did you say?

1140
01:59:57,826 --> 02:00:00,385
Nothing.
Just that we're on our way home, sir.

1141
02:00:00,495 --> 02:00:04,192
- No, operation what?
- Dinner Out, sir.

1142
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:40,968
Who are the others?

1143
02:00:42,603 --> 02:00:44,697
Here it is. Patricia Lemour,

1144
02:00:44,805 --> 02:00:46,706
Sandra Harris and Peggy Dye.

1145
02:00:46,808 --> 02:00:48,866
All agents or civilian assets.

1146
02:00:48,977 --> 02:00:52,707
- They were all cover wives.
- And who was he talking to?

1147
02:01:07,761 --> 02:01:10,787
There's been an incident in China.

1148
02:01:17,505 --> 02:01:19,803
Jesus Christ.

1149
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,065
