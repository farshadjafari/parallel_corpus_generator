158
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:34,444
And I'm gonna play like shit because
I didn't have a good night's sleep.

159
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,904
- Why'd you agree to come in then ?
- Hey, I'm only here until 12:00.

160
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,154
After that, I'm gone.
The boss comes in.

161
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,158
- Why don't you open the shutters?
Get some sunlight in here.
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,118
- You're kidding.
- Bunch of savages in this town.

163
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:54,914
- Thanks.
- How much money did you leave up there?

164
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:57,956
Like, three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

165
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,833
This time in the morning,
people just get a paper or coffee.

166
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,459
- You're trusting.
- Why do you say that ?

167
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:07,503
How do you know they're taking
the right amount of change
or even paying for what they take ?

168
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:10,339
Theoretically, people see money
on the counter, no one around,

169
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,507
they think they're being watched.

170
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,800
Honesty through paranoia.

171
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:17,051
Why do you smell like shoe polish ?

172
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,677
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

173
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:22,887
- Smell won't come off.

can see us down here ?

- Can we ?
- Really ?

177
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:32,557
- l was kidding.
- Like you can't get enough of me.

178
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:35,936
- Typically male point of view.
- How do you figure ?

179

Show some bedroom proficiency,

What about what we do for you ?

181
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:45,607
Women as lovers are basically the same;
they just have to be there.

182
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,526
- Be there ?
- Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

183

Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

184
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:54,403
How flattering.

185
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:57,446
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

You think so ?

187
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:02,365
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

188
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,118
A guy makes a woman come,
it's talent.

- And l actually date you ?
- Something wrong ?

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,663
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it
takes more than that to get a guy off.

191

Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

Hmm, I've touched a nerve.

193

I'm astonished to hear you
you trivialize my role in our sex life.

194

It wasn't directed at you.
I was making a broad generalization.

195
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:24,919
You're making a generalization
about broads.

Including you ? Yes.

- You're a pig !

- Do you know how many different men
I've had sex with ?

- Three, including you.
- You only slept
with three different people ?

That's why you should feel like a pig.

that says yes.
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.

Vegetable, meaning paraplegic.

the least amount of struggle.

- Where ?
- To school.

221

There's a seminar about getting
back into a scholastic program...

Can't we ever have a discussion
without that coming up ?

It's important to me, Dante.

225

You have so much potential
that's going to waste in this pit.

- Stop. You're making my head hurt.

- Why do you call him that ?

It's a blow job thing.

What do you mean ?

245
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:46,453
After the blow job, he likes to have it
spit back into his mouth while kissing.

246
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:48,371
It's called snowballing.

247
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:51,122
- He requests this ?
- He gets off on it.

248
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:54,415
- Silvan can be talked into anything.
- Why do you say that ?

249

- Silvan ? No, l snowballed him.
- Yeah, right.

- You sucked that guy's dick ?
- Yeah. How do you think l knew--

You said you only had sex
with three different guys !
You never mentioned him !

you only had sex with three guys ?

- No, but you sucked enough dick !
- Yeah, l went down on a few guys.

- One of those guys was you.
The last one, l might add.

279

to comprehend, means that

I'm the town whore, because you
were plenty busy before you met me.

Why couldn't you sleep with them

- No ! He was probably
just resting his eyes.

""resting his eyes"" ?

I get blitzed, pass out in his bedroom.

-Caitlin comes in and jumps all over me.
-So that's cheating ?

353

- No.
In the middle of it she called me Brad.
- She called you Brad ?

354
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:27,997
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

355

- One time, l called this girl ""mom.""
- l hit the light, she freaks.

- She thought l was Brad Michelson.
- What do you mean ?

357
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,711
She was supposed to meet Brad in a
dark bedroom. She picked the wrong one.

358
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:38,837
- She didn't even know
I was at the party.
- Oh, my God.

- That girl was vile to you.

Interesting postscript to that story.
Do you know who wound up
in that bedroom with Brad ?

- Your mother ?
- Alan Harris.

362

- Chess team Alan Harris ?
- The two moved to Idaho together.

drove men to deviant lifestyles.

There was a lot of good
in our relationship.

Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

- They are.

she's a different person.
She's frightened, vulnerable.

and about to enter the real world.

- And she's looking for support.

- l think this is leading
our relationship to a new level.
- What about Veronica ?

377
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:30,699
I think the arguments Veronica and l are
having are some kind of manifestation...

378
00:23:30,782 --> 00:23:32,825
of a subconscious desire
to break up with her,

379
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:35,284
so l can pursue a more meaningful
relationship with Caitlin.

380
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:38,035

- it's safe to say yes.

466
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,542
Empire had the better ending.

467
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:10,919
I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off,
finds out Vader's his father.

468
00:29:11,044 --> 00:29:14,504
Han gets frozen, taken away by
Boba Fett. it ends on such a down note.

469
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:18,005
I mean, that's what life is:
a series of down endings.

470
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,715
All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

471
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:23,968
There was something else
going on in Jedi.
I never noticed it 'til today.

472
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:26,261
- They build another Death Star, right ?
- Yeah.

473
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:29,387
The first one
was completed and fully operational
before the rebels destroyed it.

474
00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:31,805
Luke blew it up.
Give credit where credit's due.

475
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:35,349
- The second one was still
being built when they blew it up.
- Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

476
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,183
Something just never sat right with me
that second time around.

477
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:41,018
I could never put my finger on it,
but something just wasn't right.

478
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:44,978
- And you figured it out.
- The first Death Star
was manned by the lmperial Army.

479
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,605
The only people on board were Storm
Troopers, dignitaries, lmperialists.

480
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:52,526
- Basically.
- So when they blew it up, no problem.
Evil's punished.

481
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:56,402
- And the second time around ?
- it wasn't even done being built yet.

482
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,694
- it was still under construction.
- So ?

483
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:01,154
A construction job
of that magnitude would require...

484
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:04,322
a lot more manpower
than the lmperial Army had to offer.

485
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:07,157
I'll bet they brought independent
contractors in on that thing.

486
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:09,991
- Plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers--
- Not just lmperialists.

487
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:12,451
- Is that what you're getting at ?
- Exactly.

488
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:15,202
To get it built quickly and quietly,
they'd hire anybody
that could do the job.

489
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:17,872
You think the average Storm Trooper
knows how to install a toilet main ?

490
00:30:17,956 --> 00:30:22,457
- All they know is killing.
- So they bring in
independent contractors.

491
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:27,377
- Why are you so upset ?
- Those innocent contractors
brought in are killed,

492
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:30,294
casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

493
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:34,505
Look, you're a roofer. Some juicy
government contract comes your way.

494
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,464
You got a wife and kids,
the two-story in suburbia.

495
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:40,632
This is a government contract
which means all sorts of benefits.

496
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,842
Along come these left-wing militants
who blast everything...

497
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,970
within a three-mile radius
with their lasers.

498
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,596
You didn't ask for that;
you had no personal politics.

499
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,722
- You're just trying
to scrape out a living.
- l don't mean to interrupt,

500
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:53,807
- but what are you talking about ?
- The ending of Return Of The Jedi.

501
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:58,601
My friend is trying to convince me
that independent contractors
working on the Death Star...

502
00:30:58,643 --> 00:31:01,269
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed by the rebels.

503
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:03,979
I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

504
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,938
""Done And Ready Home improvements.""

505
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,189
Speaking as a roofer, l can tell you
a roofer's personal politics...

506
00:31:09,273 --> 00:31:12,359
- comes into play heavily
when choosing jobs.
- Like when ?

507
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:15,735
Three weeks ago, l was offered a job
up in the hills. Beautiful house.

508
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:18,779
Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

509
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:22,572
They told me if l could finish it
in one day, l would double my price.

510
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:25,240
- Then l realized whose house it was.
- [ Dante ] Whose house was it ?

511
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:29,367
- Dominic Bambino's.
- Baby Face Bambino ? The gangster ?

512
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:33,369
The same ! The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

513
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:37,537
I knew who he was, and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend.

514
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:40,207
- Based on personal politics.
- Right !

515
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:44,584
The next week, the Foresie family
put a hit on Baby Face's house.

516
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:49,336
- My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.
- No way.

517
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:53,380
I'm alive because l knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

518
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:55,381
My friend wasn't so lucky.

519
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:59,424
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

520
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:02,050
If they got killed,
it's their own fault.

521
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:05,095
A roofer listens to this,
not his wallet.

522
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:19,685
They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good.

523
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:26,105
Are either one of these any good ?

524
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,065
- Sir ?
- What ?

525
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:31,941
- Are either one of these any good ?
- l don't watch movies.

526
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:35,361
[ Sighs ] Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them ?

527
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:38,738
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

528
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:42,740
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these ?

529
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:44,741
Nope.

530
00:32:44,824 --> 00:32:46,742
[ Sighs ]

531
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:52,161
- Well, what about these two ?
- They suck.

532
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,537
[ Sighs ]
These are the same two movies.

533
00:32:55,662 --> 00:32:59,122
- You weren't paying any attention.
- No, l wasn't.

534
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,750
I don't think your manager
would appreciate it--

535
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:04,794
- l don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
- l beg your pardon ?

536
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:08,504
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

537
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:12,880
I was only pointing out that
you weren't paying any attention
to what l was saying.

538
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:14,798
And l hope it feels good.

539
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:18,424
- You hope what feels good ?
- l hope it feels so good to be right.

540
00:33:18,424 --> 00:33:20,384
There's nothing more exhilarating...

541
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,551
than pointing out
the shortcomings of others, is there ?

542
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:25,886
[ Heavy Sigh ] Well, this is
the last time l rent here !

543
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:29,264
- You will be missed.
- Screw you !

544
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:35,893
- Hey, you're not allowed
to rent here anymore !
- [ Jay ] Yeah !

545
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:37,852
Screw me ?

546
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:53,611
- You'll never believe
what this unruly customer just said.
- Wait.

547
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:57,029
- She in here ?
- This guy's going through all the eggs.

548
00:33:57,113 --> 00:33:59,656
This has been going on
for 20 minutes now.

549
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:02,365
- What's he looking for ?
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.

550
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,325
- Perfect dozen ?
- Each egg has to be perfect.

551
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,617
- The quest isn't going well ?
- Obviously not.

552
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:11,078
- Look at all the cartons
that didn't make the grade.
- Why doesn't he mix and match ?

553
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:13,704
- l told him that, and he yelled at me.
- What'd he say ?

554
00:34:13,787 --> 00:34:17,080
He said
it was important to have standards.
He says no one has any pride anymore.

555
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:19,415
It's not like
you laid the eggs yourself.

556
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:22,459
I give him five more minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

557
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,503
I don't need this.
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

558
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:28,713
Two packs of cigarettes.

559
00:34:31,422 --> 00:34:34,882
- I'm as puzzled as you.
- I've actually seen it before.

560
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:38,050
- You know him ?
- No, but l know the behavior.

561
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:41,176
- Let me guess. He's looking
for the perfect carton of eggs ?
- [ Randal ] How'd you know ?

562
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,095
- I'll bet you a million dollars
he's a guidance counselor.
- [ Dante ] Why do you say that ?

563
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:49,182
I saw it happen in Food City,
Like, last year. Different guy, though.

564
00:34:49,307 --> 00:34:52,267
Stock boy said he'd been looking through
cartons of eggs for half an hour,

565
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,852
doing all sorts
of endurance tests and stuff.

566
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:57,310
I asked him why nobody ever called
the manager, and he said it happens...

567
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:59,645
two, three times a week, sometimes more.

568
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:01,938
- Get out of here.
- No, l kid you not.

569
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:05,440
They call it shell shock. Seems to
only happen with guidance counselors.

570
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:08,315
They used to make a big deal of it,
but they just let it go now...

571
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:11,568
because they always pay
for whatever they break,
and they never bother anybody.

572
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,568
Why guidance counselors ?

573
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:16,530
If your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too ?

574
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:20,073
- Come to think of it, my guidance
counselor was kinda worthless.
- See ?

575
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:22,533
It's important to have a job
that makes a difference, boys.

576
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:27,744
That's why l manually masturbate caged
animals for artificial insemination.

577
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:33,288
<MUSIC> Go your own way <MUSIC>

578
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,498
<MUSIC> You can call it
another lonely day <MUSIC><MUSIC>

579
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:06,221
Did you ever notice
that all the prices end in ""9"" ?

580
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:08,222
Damn, that's eerie.

581
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:12,142
- Do you know how much the average
jiz-mopper makes per hour ?
- What's a jiz-mopper ?

582
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:15,436
The guy that cleans up the nudie booths
after each guy jerks off.

583
00:36:15,478 --> 00:36:17,562
- ""Nudie booth"" ?
- Yeah, nudie booth.

584
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:20,188
- You ever been in a nudie booth ?
- Guess not.

585
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:22,230
Oh, man, it's great.

586
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,732
You go into this booth, and there's
this glass between you and these chicks.

587
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:28,108
- And they put on a show for you
for, like, ten bucks.
- What kind of a show ?

588
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,318
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit
you'd like to see chicks do.

589
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,111
These chicks do it all. They insert
things into any opening on their body.

590
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,531
- Any opening.
- Can we not talk about this now ?

591
00:36:37,657 --> 00:36:40,741
The jiz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

592
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,117
Practically everybody
does it right on the window.

593
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,285
I don't know if you know this,
but cum leaves streaks
if you don't clean it right away.

594
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:49,411
- l will never come to this place again.
- Excuse me ?

595
00:36:49,453 --> 00:36:53,288
Using filthy language in front of
the customers. You both should be fired.

596
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:56,915
Oh, l-I'm sorry.
I guess we kinda got carried away.

597
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:59,999
I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

598
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,793
You've highly offended me.

599
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:05,837
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

600
00:37:05,921 --> 00:37:07,797
Oh !
[ Screaming ]

601
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,632
- l think you can see her kidneys.
- Why do you do things like that ?

602
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:13,508
- You know he's only going
to come back and tell the boss.
- Who cares ?

603
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:16,550
That guy's an asshole. Everybody
that comes in here is way too uptight.

604
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:19,594
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

605
00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:22,929
- Jesus ! I'm gonna hear
from the boss tomorrow.
- Would you loosen up ?

606
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:26,097
You'd feel a lot better if you'd just
rip into the occasional customer.

607
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:29,139
Why ? l-l don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

608
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:33,936
Liar ! Tell me there aren't
customers that annoy the piss
out of you on a daily basis.

609
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:36,645
- There aren't !
- How can you lie like that ?

610
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:42,273
Why don't you vent ? Vent your
frustrations. Who pisses you off ?

611
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:45,774
Well, l guess it isn't
customers in particular.

612
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:48,651
Maybe just a group of customers.

613
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:52,986
- Well, let's hear it.
- Well, the Milk Maids.

614
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:54,945
The Milk Maids ?

615
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:58,991
The women that go through every gallon
of milk, looking for that later date,

616
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:02,033
as if somewhere beyond all the other
gallons is a container of milk...

617
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:04,827

00:56:52,963 --> 00:56:56,423
- What ?
- lf title dictated my behavior
as a clerk serving the public,

925
00:56:56,465 --> 00:56:59,425
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy, but l did.

926
00:56:59,425 --> 00:57:02,011
My point is that
people dictate their own behavior.

927
00:57:02,053 --> 00:57:05,471
Even though l work in a video store,
I choose to rent movies at Big Choice.

928
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:08,931
- Agreed ?
- You are a danger
to both the dead and the living.

929
00:57:08,973 --> 00:57:11,474
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

930
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,516
- Please get the hell outta here.
- You know I'm your hero.

931
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:23,021
Sounds to me like somebody
needs to hit the gym.

932
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:25,855
- Excuse me ?
- l heard you strain
when you picked up that milk.

933
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,984
- it only weighs seven pounds.
- l didn't strain. l sighed.

934
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:31,360
I don't think so.
That was a grunt.

935
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:34,903
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

936
00:57:34,986 --> 00:57:39,113
I'm a trainer. l know what that
sound signifies. You're out of shape.

937
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:42,365
- What ? There's no fat on my body.
- No fat !

938
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,866
No tone either.
You don't get enough exercise.

939
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:46,909
- You open ?
- Yes.

940
00:57:46,992 --> 00:57:49,701
- Just the paper.
- Thirty-five.

941
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:53,411
Hey, uh, let me ask you a question.
Think this guy's out of shape ?

942
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,414
I don't know.
Can't really tell from here.

943
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:58,333
- l am-- l am not !
- He is.

944
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,333
How much can you bench ?

945
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:03,460
- l don't know.
- I'd say about 60, 70, tops.

946
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:05,419
I know l can bench more than that.

947
00:58:05,461 --> 00:58:08,295
- Three-fifty, four.
- No way !

948
00:58:08,337 --> 00:58:10,338
Feel that.

949
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,214
Hey, that's tight.
Solid.

950
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:15,548
Yeah. Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

951
00:58:15,548 --> 00:58:18,092
- Oh, for God's sakes !
- See, you're ashamed.

952
00:58:18,175 --> 00:58:20,176
You know you're out of shape.

953
00:58:20,218 --> 00:58:22,137
Here.
Take my card.

954
00:58:22,262 --> 00:58:24,137
I can get you on
an aerobics/free weights program.

955
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:27,139
- Are you open ?
- [ Dante ] Yes. I'm not out of shape.

956
00:58:27,223 --> 00:58:29,182
Excuse me.
Have you been here all day ?

957
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:32,350
- Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
- He's got those love handles.

958
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:34,434
I don't have love handles !

959
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:36,602
- Were you working here about 4:00 ?
- Yes.

960
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:39,603
- it's probably from being
around all this food every day.
- Oh, l know.

961
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:43,271
If l had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

962
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:46,065
- I'm not out of shape.
- Can l have your name, please ?

963
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,482
Dante Hicks. Why ?
What's this all about ?

964
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:52,736
You're Dante Hicks ? Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognize you.

965
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,404
- Because he's out of shape !
- Do l know you ?

966
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:58,030
Yeah. Do you remember Alyssa Jones ?
She used to hang out--

967
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:59,906
- With Caitlin Bree !
- I'm her sister.

968
00:58:59,948 --> 00:59:01,865
You're Alyssa's sister Heather ?

969
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:04,075
- Yeah.
- You, uh, say Caitlin Bree ?

970
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,159
- Yeah.
- Pretty girl ?

971
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:08,785
A little taller than her ?
Gorgeous body ?

972
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:10,869
- Yeah.
- And you're Dante Hicks.

973
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:12,996
You went to the same school.
You played hockey.

974
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:15,705
- Yeah. How did you know that ?
- You still goin' out with her ?

975
00:59:15,746 --> 00:59:17,874
- No, she's getting married.
- To you ?

976
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,959
No. To an Asian design major.

977
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:22,002
Aw, shit !

978
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:25,336
Don't take this the wrong way,
but, uh, l used to fuck her.

979
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:27,838
- What ?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.

980
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:30,672
While you two were dating.
I drove a black Trans Am.

981
00:59:30,797 --> 00:59:32,715
- You're Rick Daress ?
- Yeah.

982
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,757
- You know him ?
- Yeah.

983
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:37,342
- Caitlin used to
talk about him all the time.
- Really ?

984
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:41,510
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while l was dating her ?

985
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:44,389
Nah, man, don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

986
00:59:44,472 --> 00:59:46,806
I'm surprised you didn't
know about it, Dante.

987
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:49,599
Everybody in school knew about it.
Even in my class.

988
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:51,642
Jesus Christ ! What next ?

989
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:53,601
- Here you go.
- What's this ?

990
00:59:53,685 --> 00:59:55,436
- A fine for $500.
- What ?

991
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,520
Five hundred bucks ?
For what ?

992
00:59:57,562 --> 01:00:02,105
For violation of New Jersey Statute,
Section 2A, Number 170/51.

993
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:04,732
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco,

994
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:07,774
or tobacco-related products,
to persons under the age of 18,

995
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:09,775
is regarded as disorderly.

996
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:14,154
- What are you talkin' about ?
- An angry mother called
the state division of taxation...

997
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:16,196
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee...

998
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:19,365
sold her four-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes at 4:00 today.

999
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,241
The New Jersey Division of Taxation
called the Board of Health...

1000
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:24,284
and sent me down to issue a fine.

1001
01:00:24,326 --> 01:00:27,827
You claimed you were working here
all day. Hence, the fine is yours.

1002
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:30,537
The fine is doubled due to
the incredibly young age of the child.

1003
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:32,537
But l didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids !

1004
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:35,706
You sold cigarettes to a four-year-old ?
What a scumbag !

1005
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:37,876
That's sick, Dante.

1006
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:40,126
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids !
I swear !

1007
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:45,212
The due date is on the bottom.
This summons cannot be contested
in any court of law.

1008
01:00:45,253 --> 01:00:47,338
Failure to remit before the due date...

1009
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:49,339
will result
in a charge of criminal negligence,

1010
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,256
and a warrant
will be issued for your arrest.

1011
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,175
- Have a nice day.
- But l didn't sell
any cigarettes to any kids.

1012
01:00:54,258 --> 01:00:57,301
Hey, wait a minute !

1013
01:00:57,343 --> 01:01:01,844
Forget it. l don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to four-year-olds.

1014
01:01:01,928 --> 01:01:04,220
Can l, uh, give you
a lift somewhere ?

1015
01:01:04,262 --> 01:01:07,183
Sure. How 'bout the beach ?

1016
01:01:07,265 --> 01:01:09,224
I like the way you think.

1017
01:01:13,977 --> 01:01:15,937
Jesus ! What next ?

1018
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,521
- [ Woman ] Dante ?
- What ? Caitlin !

- When did you get home ?
- Just now.

1021
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,036
I can't believe it.
I haven't seen you in so long.

1022
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:51,204
Dante, you have a customer.

1023
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:57,165
I just saw Alyssa's
Little sister outside.

1024
01:01:57,207 --> 01:02:00,169
- She was with Rick Daress.
- Let's not talk about her.

1025
01:02:00,253 --> 01:02:03,212
- How'd you get home ?
- Train. it took eight hours.

1026
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:05,338
- l can't believe you're here.
- Excuse me. Do you have--

1027
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,589
Uh, yeah. Back behind the oil.
How long you staying ?

1028
01:02:07,672 --> 01:02:10,632
Until Monday.
Then l have to take the train back.

1029
01:02:10,715 --> 01:02:12,841
Pack of cigarettes.
Hey, congratulations.

1030
01:02:12,925 --> 01:02:14,884
I saw the announcement
in today's paper.

1031
01:02:14,968 --> 01:02:16,884
You know, she's marrying
an Asian design major.

1032
01:02:16,926 --> 01:02:18,885

<MUSIC><MUSIC> [ Hip-Hop ]

You're just gonna close
the store like that ?

1035
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,570
I wanna talk to you about something,
and l don't wanna be disturbed.

1036
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:54,698
Something l read in the tabloids.

1037
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,740
- You saw it.
- Very dramatic, l thought.

1038
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,908
- it is not what you think.
- Oh, it's not what l think.

1039
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:01,909
What is it, worse ? You're pregnant
with the Asian design major's child ?

1040
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:04,035
- What's goin' on here ?
- l am not pregnant.

1041
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:06,744
Were you gonna tell me, or were
you gonna send me an invitation ?

1042
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:10,037
I was gonna tell you,
but we were getting along so well,
I didn't wanna mess it up.

1043
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,163
You could've broken it to me gently.

1044
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,082
You could've started
by telling me you had a boyfriend.
I told you l had a girlfriend.

1045
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,166
I know. I'm sorry,
but when we started talking,
it was like l forgot l had a boyfriend.

1046
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,670
- And then he proposed last month.
- And you said yes.

1047
01:03:21,753 --> 01:03:23,629
Well, kind of. Sort of.

1048
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:26,505
Is that what they teach you in that
school of yours ? ""Kind of,"" ""sort of"" ?

1049
01:03:26,505 --> 01:03:29,299
Everybody knows about this except me !
Do you know how humiliating that is ?

1050
01:03:29,382 --> 01:03:32,258
I would've told you, and you would've
stopped calling me, like a baby.

1051
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,342
- How do you know that ?
- Because l know you.

1052
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:36,969
You prefer drastic measures
to rational ones.

1053
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:39,386
- So you're really getting married ?
- No.

1054
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:41,762
- You're not really getting married ?
- [ Scoffs ]

1055
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:46,140
The story goes like this: He proposed,
I told him l had to think about it,

1056
01:03:46,182 --> 01:03:48,268
and he insisted
that l wear the ring anyway.

1057
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:50,810
Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

1058
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:53,395
- Oh, how like her.
- Then my mother called this morning...

1059
01:03:53,478 --> 01:03:55,896
to let me know that
the announcement was in the paper.

1060
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:59,148
That's when l hopped a train
to come back here,
because l knew you'd be a wreck.

1061
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,815
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was l right ?

1062
01:04:01,982 --> 01:04:03,900
""Wreck"" is a harsh term.

1063
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,984
""Disturbed"" is more like it.
""Mildly disturbed,"" even.

1064
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:09,652
Oh, l love a macho facade.
It is such a turn-on.

1065
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:13,613
- What smells like shoe polish ?
- So you came here to what ?
To comfort me ?

1066
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:16,657
The last thing l needed was for you to
think l was hiding something from you.

1067
01:04:16,782 --> 01:04:19,075
- But you were !
- No, l wasn't ! Not really.

1068
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:21,035
I told you
I'd been seeing other people.

1069
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,036
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
you're ready to walk down the aisle.

1070
01:04:24,077 --> 01:04:26,120

more than just seeing somebody.

01:04:26,204 --> 01:04:29,330
- What's going on ?
- I'm giving him his ring back.

- What ?
- [ Sighs ] l don't want to marry him.

and then l want to start a career.

and then have to worry about...

when I'm gonna
fit in the other stuff.

I have come way too far
and studied too damn hard...

1078

1388
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:13,413
- [ Dante ] One seventy-nine.
- Pay the good man.

1389
01:20:14,663 --> 01:20:17,248
- Yeah, you close soon ?
- in half an hour.

1390
01:20:17,331 --> 01:20:19,207
Yeah, we get off
the same time every day.

1391
01:20:19,332 --> 01:20:21,791
- We should hang out. You get high ?
- l should start.

1392
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:24,418
Wanna come to this party tonight ?
There's gonna be some pussy there.

1393
01:20:24,543 --> 01:20:26,419
With you ? l don't think so.

1394
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,753
Oh, look at you.
""l don't hang out with drug dealers.""

1395
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:32,046
- Nothing personal.
- What happened with that old guy ?

1396
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:35,049
- He died in the bathroom.
- l heard he was jerkin' off
or something.

1397
01:20:35,133 --> 01:20:37,259
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

1398
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,760
He probably saw that Caitlin chick.
I know l felt like beatin' it
when l saw her.

1399
01:20:40,844 --> 01:20:42,928
Oh, come here, bitch.
You like this ? Huh ?

1400
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:46,304
- This what you want ?
- Knock it off. That used to be
my girlfriend, all right ?

1401
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:48,264
Oh, you used to go out with her ?

1402
01:20:48,347 --> 01:20:50,598
Yeah, well, l thought
we might be starting again.

1403
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,183
- Don't you already have a girlfriend ?
- [ Dante ] Yeah, Veronica.

1404
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:57,601
- And what, you're gonna dump her
for that Caitlin chick ?
- Maybe.

1405
01:20:57,643 --> 01:21:00,644
I don't know, dude. That Caitlin chick's
nice, but l see that Veronica girl...

1406
01:21:00,644 --> 01:21:02,647
doin' shit for you all the time.

1407
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:05,690
I saw her rubbin' your back,
fuckin' comes and brings your food.

1408
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:08,567
-Didn't l see her change your tire once?
-Hey, l jacked up the car.

1409
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:11,109
All she did was unloosen the nuts
and put the tire on.

1410
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:14,736
- Well, l know she does a lot for you.
- She's my girlfriend.

1411
01:21:14,777 --> 01:21:19,030
I had some girlfriends too, but all
they wanted from me was weed and shit.

1412
01:21:19,071 --> 01:21:20,989
Shit, my grandmother used to say,
""What's better ?

1413
01:21:21,114 --> 01:21:24,073
Fuckin' a good plate
with nothin' on it ?""

1414
01:21:24,115 --> 01:21:26,658
No, wait. l fucked up. ""What's
a good plate with nothin' on it ?""

1415
01:21:26,742 --> 01:21:28,703
Meaning ?

1416
01:21:28,745 --> 01:21:32,663
I don't know. She was senile. She used
to fuckin' piss herself all the time...

1417
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:34,706
and shit herself.

1418
01:21:34,748 --> 01:21:37,874
Come on, Silent Bob. Let's get
the fuck outta this fuckin' gyp joint...

1419
01:21:37,957 --> 01:21:40,167
with this fuckin' faggot Dante.

1420
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:42,542
You cock smoker.

1421
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:45,627
You know, there's a million
fine-lookin' women in the world, dude,

1422
01:21:45,753 --> 01:21:47,711
but they don't all bring ya
Lasagna at work.

1423
01:21:47,753 --> 01:21:49,712
Most of 'em just cheat on ya.

1424
01:21:49,837 --> 01:21:52,255
[ Jay ]
Come on, limp dick !

1425
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:54,798
[ Silent Bob ]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1426
01:21:56,259 --> 01:21:58,218
He's right.

1427
01:21:58,302 --> 01:22:00,927
I love her.

1428
01:22:00,969 --> 01:22:04,638
So that's it. He doesn't love you
anymore. He loves Caitlin.

1429
01:22:04,721 --> 01:22:06,805
And he told you all of this ?

1430
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:11,183
Pretty much. All except
the latent homosexuality part.
That's just my theory.

1431
01:22:11,224 --> 01:22:13,558
Uh-- l don't know what to say.

1432
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:17,518
Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.

1433
01:22:17,602 --> 01:22:20,645
It's not your fault. it's Dante.

1434
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:23,607
I-Look. l don't know
thing one about chicks.

1435
01:22:23,774 --> 01:22:26,733
So if you gotta cry or something,
I can get outta here.

1436
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,151
- I'm not sad.
- You're not ?

1437
01:22:29,193 --> 01:22:31,235
Ow ! What'd you do that for ?

1438
01:22:31,277 --> 01:22:34,236
If you didn't wanna go out with me
anymore, why didn't you say so ?

1439
01:22:34,236 --> 01:22:36,738
Instead you pussyfoot around
and see that slut behind my back !

1440
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:39,781
- What are you talking about ?
- You've been talking to her
on the phone for weeks !

1441
01:22:39,822 --> 01:22:42,282
- it was only a few times.
- Then you pull that shit this morning,

1442
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,325
freaking out because
I've gone down a couple of guys.

1443
01:22:44,408 --> 01:22:47,409
- Oh, a couple ?
- I'm not the one trying
to patch things up with my ex,

1444
01:22:47,493 --> 01:22:49,369
sneaking around behind your back !

1445
01:22:49,494 --> 01:22:52,413
If you think 37 dicks are a lot,
just wait and see, mister.

1446
01:22:52,455 --> 01:22:55,332
I'm going to put the hookers
in Times Square to shame
with all the guys l go down on now !

1447
01:22:55,415 --> 01:22:57,374
- Will you let me explain ?
- Explain what ?

1448
01:22:57,457 --> 01:23:00,376
How you've been waiting
until the time was right, and then
you were going to dump me for her ?

1449
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:02,502
- it isn't like that !
- Damn right it isn't like that !

1450
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:06,212
Because l won't let it be like that.
You want your slut ?
Fine, the slut is yours.

1451
01:23:06,337 --> 01:23:08,879
- l don't want Caitlin.
- You don't know what you want !

1452
01:23:08,963 --> 01:23:12,005
But I'm not going to sit here
holding your hand anymore
until you figure it out !

1453
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,173
I've tried with you, Dante.

1454
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:17,300
I've encouraged you to get out of this
fucking dump and go back to school,

1455
01:23:17,386 --> 01:23:19,552
to take charge of your life
and find direction.

1456
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:21,720
I even transferred
so maybe you'd be more inclined...

1457
01:23:21,762 --> 01:23:23,805
to go back to college
if l was with you.

1458
01:23:23,888 --> 01:23:26,139
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but l didn't care...

1459
01:23:26,223 --> 01:23:28,099
because l loved you
and wanted to see you...

1460
01:23:28,224 --> 01:23:30,641
pull yourself out of this senseless funk
that you've been in...

1461
01:23:30,683 --> 01:23:32,517
since that whore dumped you
oh, so many years ago.

1462
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:35,352
Now you wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over some more !

1463
01:23:35,394 --> 01:23:37,978
- l don't wanna go back--
- Of course not ! Not now !

1464
01:23:38,144 --> 01:23:40,980
You're caught,
and now you're trying to snake out
of doing what you wanted to do !

1465
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,855
Well, l won't let you.

1466
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:45,984
I want you to follow through on this
so you can find out
what a fucking idiot you are !

1467
01:23:46,025 --> 01:23:48,943
And when she dumps you again--
and l promise you, she will--

1468
01:23:48,985 --> 01:23:51,403
I want to laugh in your face
so you realize that...

1469
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:53,320
that was what you gave up
our relationship for !

1470
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,071
I'm just glad that Randal had the balls
to tell me since you couldn't !

1471
01:23:56,113 --> 01:23:59,073
- Randal ?
- And having him tell me,
that was just the weakest move ever.

1472
01:23:59,115 --> 01:24:01,241
- You're spineless !
- Veronica, l love you !

1473
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:03,075
Fuck you !

How's your eye ?

1486
01:24:54,643 --> 01:24:57,854
The swelling's not that bad,
but the F.D.S. stings.

1487
01:24:59,313 --> 01:25:02,397
- How's your neck ?
- it's kinda hard to swallow.

1488
01:25:04,023 --> 01:25:05,982
You didn't have to choke me, you know.

1489
01:25:06,065 --> 01:25:09,402
Why did you tell Veronica that l was
gonna dump her to go back with Caitlin ?

1490
01:25:09,444 --> 01:25:12,571
- l thought l was doing you a favor.
- Oh, Jesus.

1491
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:14,697
You're always saying
how you can't initiate change yourself.

1492
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:16,572
I thought I'd give you a hand.

1493
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:18,781
Thanks.

1494
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:20,741
You still didn't have to choke me.

1495
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,784
Oh, please.
I'm surprised l didn't kill you.

1496
01:25:23,826 --> 01:25:25,951
- Why do you say that ?
- Why do l say that ?

1497
01:25:25,993 --> 01:25:27,994
Randal-- [ Sighs ]
Forget it.

1498
01:25:28,036 --> 01:25:31,121
- No, really.
What did l do that was so wrong ?
- What don't you do ?

1499
01:25:31,204 --> 01:25:34,416
Sometimes l think
the only reason you come to work
is to make my life miserable.

1500
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:36,791
- How do you figure ?
- What time did you get to work today ?

1501
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:39,251
Like 10:00, or ten after.

1502
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:42,419
You were over a half an hour late.
And then all you do is come in here.

1503
01:25:42,461 --> 01:25:46,213
- Yeah, to talk to you.
- Which means the video store
is ostensibly closed !

1504
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:48,339
Oh, it's not like I'm miles away.

1505
01:25:48,339 --> 01:25:50,381
Unless you're out renting video
at other video stores.

1506
01:25:50,465 --> 01:25:54,634
- Hermaphrodites. l rented it
so we could watch it together.
- You get me slapped with a fine.

1507
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:57,676
You argue with the customers,
and l have to patch everything up.

1508
01:25:57,718 --> 01:26:00,053
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating the corpse.

1509
01:26:00,094 --> 01:26:03,932
Then to top it all off,
you ruin my relationship.
I mean, what's your encore ?

1510
01:26:04,057 --> 01:26:07,767
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank ?

1511
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:13,560
You know what the real tragedy
about all of this is ?

1512
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,686
I'm not even supposed
to be here today !

1513
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:19,146
Oh, fuck you !
Fuck you, pal !

1514
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:21,397
Jesus, there you go,
trying to pass the buck.

1515
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:23,357
I'm the source of all your misery.

1516
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,108
Who closed the store to play hockey ?
Who closed the store to go to a wake ?

1517
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:29,237
Who tried to win back
his ex-girlfriend...

1518
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:32,279
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one ?

1519
01:26:32,363 --> 01:26:34,989
You wanna blame somebody ?
Blame yourself.

1520
01:26:35,073 --> 01:26:36,949
""I'm not even supposed
to be here today.""

1521
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:38,824
You sound like an asshole !

1522
01:26:38,908 --> 01:26:40,908
Jesus, nobody twisted
your arm to be here.

1523
01:26:40,991 --> 01:26:43,117
You're here of your own volition.

1524
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:46,119
You like to think the weight
of the world rests on your shoulder,

1525
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:49,037
Like this place would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

1526
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:51,955
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

1527
01:26:52,038 --> 01:26:57,001
You push fuckin' buttons. Anybody
could waltz in here and do our jobs.

1528
01:26:57,043 --> 01:27:00,336
You're so obsessed
with making it seem so much more epic,

1529
01:27:00,336 --> 01:27:02,754
so much more important
than it really is.

1530
01:27:02,837 --> 01:27:07,422
Christ, you work in a convenience store,
Dante, and badly, l might add !

1531

I work in a shitty video store,
badly as well.

You know, that guy Jay's got it right.
He has no delusions about what he does.

1533
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:17,344
Us, we like to make ourselves
seem so much more important...

1534
01:27:17,468 --> 01:27:20,804
than the people that come in here to
buy a paper or, God forbid, cigarettes.

1535
01:27:20,887 --> 01:27:23,139
We look down on them
as if we're so advanced.

1536
01:27:23,265 --> 01:27:25,140
Well, if we're so fuckin' advanced,

1537
01:27:25,266 --> 01:27:27,642
what are we doin' workin' here ?

1538
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:49,362
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I put the cat next door.

1539
01:27:49,445 --> 01:27:52,905
- Need a ride home ?
