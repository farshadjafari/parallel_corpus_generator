come up very rarely

The intruder enters
in the dark and cuts
Charles Leeds' throat.

The children were still in bed
when they were shot,

203
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,710
which might indicate
that he used a silencer.

204
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,600
He dragged the bodies into
the master bedroom, but why?

357
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,530
their style, so to speak,

358
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,080
were you able, perhaps,
to reconstruct his fantasies?

359
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,000
And, if so, did you
jot down any impressions?

360
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,170
No.

361
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,630
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.

362

You must have some advice.

366
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,820

So nice of the Bureau's

379
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,070

even to a layman.

380
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,450
You say you're a layman.

381

you don't have.

Maybe even computer access.

You'd get to see

smarter than the person
i'm looking for.

406
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,670
Then, by implication,
you think you're smarter
than i am,

407
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,090
since it was you
who caught me.

408

i know i'm not
smarter than you.

409
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,170
Then how did you catch me?

410
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,640
You had disadvantages.

and the lovely Molly?

419

you know.

This is a very shy boy, Will.

436
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,870
i'd love to meet him.

437
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,950
Have you considered
that he is disfigured

438
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,910
or that he may believe
he is disfigured?

439
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,080
Yeah, the mirrors.

440
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,960
Notice he smashes
all the mirrors,

441
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,380
not just enough to
get the pieces he wants.

442
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,420
And, of course,
those shards in their eyes

443
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,130
so he can see himseif there.

444
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,260
That's interesting.

445
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,720
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.

Almost. Not quite.

What were the yards like?

453
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,030
BIg backyards, fenced,
some hedges. Why?

454
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,700
Because if this pilgrim

455
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,870
feels a speciai relationship
with the moon,

456
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,500

and look at it.

are a factor

break in down there?

it's more hidden.

A bolt cutter.

He used that
to clear his view.

But?

566
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,780
i don't think that's
what he brought it for.

567
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,620
it's too heavy.
Too awkward.

568
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,580

through the patio doors.

589

and he had to shoot him
on the stairs.

not by a fault

602
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,750

to act on them
untii it was too late.

But you're wiser now.

go back in time.

00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,260
i'm not interrupting anything,
am l?

693
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:27,510
No, Ralph.

694
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,140
it's starting
to spritz outside.

695
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,270
i'll give you a lift home?

696
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,980
You ride a motorcycle.

697
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,270
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?

698
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,020
i thought maybe
we'd stop off someplace

699
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,150
have ourselves
a little sundowner.

700
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,070
i've already got a ride.
it's cool.

701
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:46,990
That's cool. No problemo.

702
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:59,920
if there's anything
i hate worse than pity,
it's fake pity.

703
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,470
Especially from
a walking hard-on
like Ralph Mandy.

704
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,720
Sorry.

705
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,100
i have no pity.

706
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,390
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

707
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,010
RIde with me!

708
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,890
Thanks, but i take
the bus all the time.

709
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,350
Mandy is a fool.
RIde with me

710
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,190
for my pleasure.

711
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,160
You want to come in?
i'll fix us a drink.

712
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,090
Maybe another time.

713
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,130
i will come in.

714
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,970
When is the zoo project?

715
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,480
Maybe next week.
They'll call.

716
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,350
i love zoos.

717
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:44,360
ln fact one of my earliest
memories is seeing a cougar

718
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,820
when i was about five.

719
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,740
i didn't lose my sight
till i was seven. Diphtheria.

720
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,910
Could you hand me that knife?

721
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:13,550
i've always tried
to hang on to what
that cougar looked like.

722
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:18,390
But by now,
to tell the truth,
what i see in my head

723
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,440
is probably not in
the least bit like a cougar.

724
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,270
it's more like
a donkey or a goat.

725
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,780
You know, sometimes i'm not
so sure i really saw him.

726
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,240
Maybe he's just something
i dreamed up.

727
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,240
You okay?

728
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,450
Uh-huh.

729
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,250
You don't say much, do you?

730
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,960
No, i guess not.

731
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,550
Let's talk about
something and get it
out of the way, okay?

732
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,640
i can hear that you've had

733
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,190
some kind of
soft palate repair.

734
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,780
But i understand you fine
because you speak very well.

735
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,070
if you don't want to
talk to me, that's cool.

736
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,120
But i hope that you will,

737
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,830
because i know what
it's like to have people

738
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,210
always thinking
that you're different.

739
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,790
That's good.

740
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,260
May i touch your face?

741
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,930
i want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

742
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,470
i want to know whether
i should just shut up or not.

743
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,030
Take my word
that i'm smiling.

744
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,830
i have to go.

745
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,410
if i offended you,
i didn't mean to.

746
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:01,830
No.

747
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:13,090
WlLL: i don't know
what the jacobis were like.

748
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,760
it'd help
if i could see some of
their personai effects.

749
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,680
Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things?

750
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,850
i sure do.
i mean, other than

751
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,600
one or two little
keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.

752
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,270
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son
by his first wife?

753
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,610
Yes. As their executor,
i keep all that stuff
in the office

754
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:35,200
along with some of
the smaller valuables,
till after probate.

755
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:38,660
But the BIrmingham P. D.'s
been all through it.

756
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,700
Could you pack those things
and ship them up to me?

757
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,000
i hate to ask.
i know it's a pain in the ass.

758
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,210
Hell,

759
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,180
probate judge is
an old goifing buddy of mine.

760
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,390
Son, just tell me
you're gonna nail
that son of a bitch.

761
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,480
We're doing our best.

762
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:07,060
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcaif.

763
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,270
A note hidden
in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter.

764
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,070
Might've been mailed
by the Tooth Fairy.

765
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,650
He wants Lecter's approval.

766
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,950
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.

767
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,490
i've scrambled a chopper.

768
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,990
Does Lecter know
we have the note?

769
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,700
CRAWFORD: not yet.
lt was found during
a routine cleanup.

770
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,040
WiLL:
They don't open his mail?

771
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,000
can't. need a warrant.
x-rays only.

772
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,170
where's Lecter now?
ln the holding cage.

773
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,670
can he see his cell?

774
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,210
no. but he's been there
almost haif an hour.

775
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,710
he'll soon start
to wonder what's wrong.

776
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,210
We got to buy time, Jack.

777
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,680
Dr. Chilton.
CHILTON: yes?

778
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,300
Call your building
superintendent

779
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,890
or engineer,
whoever's in charge.

780
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,810
Tell him to pull
the circuit breakers
on Lecter's hall.

781
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:50,100
Have the super walk down
the hall past the cell
carrying tools.

782
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,650
He'll be in a hurry,

783
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,530
pissed off, too busy
to answer questions.

784
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,030
And don't forget:
Don't touch the note, okay?

785
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,990
Graham's on his way.

786
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:04,290
LIsten up!
We've got a note
coming in on the fly,

787
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,450
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.

788
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,660
Number One Priority.

789
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,710
lt has to go back
to Lecter's cell
within the hour

790
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,130
unmarked.

791
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,760
We'll need Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, then Documents.

792
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,640
i'll walk it through myseif.
Let's go, people!

793
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,810
DOLARHYDE:
my dear dr. Lecter,

794
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,640
i wanted to tell you
i'm delighted

795
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,980
that you've taken
an interest in me.

796
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:35,360
and when i learned
of your vast correspondence,
i thought,

797
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,200
"dare l?" of course i do.

798
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,200
i don't believe
you'll tell them who i am.

799
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,040
Besides, what particular body
i currently occupy is trivial.

800
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,120
The important thing
is what i am becoming.

801
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,170
i know that you alone
can understand
this transformation.

802
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,670
i have some things
i'd love to show you.

803
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,630
if circumstances permit,
i hope we can correspond.

804
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,430
i have admired you
for years and have

805
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,850
a complete collection
of your press notices.

806
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:10,310
actually, i think of them
as unfair reviews.

807
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,480
as unfair as mine.

808
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,860
They do like to sling
demeaning nicknames,
don't they?

809
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,650
"The Tooth fairy."

810
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,780
what could be
more inappropriate?

811
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,450
lt would shame me
for you to read that,

812
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,200
if i didn't know
you had suffered

813
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,200
the same distortions
in the press.

814
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,830
i'm fed up with this
bloody stupid building !

815
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,460
Every day something breaking.

816
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,130
i swear they ought to tear
the whole fucking place down.

817
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,040
How much longer
do we have?

818
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,630
Ten minutes, max.

819
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,090
BOWMAN:
lnstructions for answering

820
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,220
were probably in the section
Lecter tore out.

821
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,680
Why not just throw
the whole note away?

822
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,550
lt was full of compliments.

823
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,850
He couldn't bear
to part with them.

824
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,150
Now we can mash
just a little.

825
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,860
You're so sly.

826
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,070
But so am l.

827
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,740
Aniline dyes and colored inks
are transparent to infrared.

828
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,870
These could be
the tips of "T's"
here and here.

829
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,000
On the end, that's a "P,"
or possibly an "R."

830
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,790
Maybe this is where
he's telling Lecter
how to answer him.

831
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,170
There's only one way
to carry on a conversation

832
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,250
that's one-way blind.

833
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,340
Publication. Wait a minute.

834
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,170
We know this guy
reads the tattler.

835
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,630
That's in his note, right?

836
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,050
The Tooth Fairy,
they made that up.

837
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,350
Three "T's"
and an "R" in "Tattler."

838
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,100
How do you communicate
through a tabloid?

839
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,770
You got what? News stories.

840
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,180
Personals.

841
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:36,060
Maybe he wants Lecter
to answer him
through the personals?

842
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,560
That could be it.
We need proofs of the pages

843
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,820
before the next
tattler's published !

844
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,980
CRAWFORD: i'm on it!

845
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,820
DOLARHYDE:
lnvestigator graham
interests me.

846
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,280
not your standard gumshoe,
is he?

847
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,370
more alert.

848
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,240
purposefui looking.

849
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,080
you should have
taught him not to meddle.

850
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,790
forgive the stationery.

851
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,120
i chose it because
it'll dissolve very quickly

852
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,290
if you should have
to swallow it.

853
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:04,720
if i hear from you,
next time i might
send you something wet.

854
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,800
untii then, dear doctor,

855
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,350
i remain your most avid fan.

856
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:35,250
CRAWFORD: The tattler
got an ad order signed 666,

857
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,370
Baltimore postmark
on the envelope.

858
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,380
it's set to run
this afternoon.

859
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,420
Chicago field office
is sending the text
through now.

860
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:47,800
"Dear Pilgrim."

it's a book code.

The first numeral,

873
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,790
"1 00 prayers,"
may be the page number.

874
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,290
The numbers after
could be line and letter.
But what book?

875
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,670

No, he's got
"Galatians 1 5:2."

876
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,260
lt has only six chapters.

877

Same with "Jonah 6:8."
lt has four chapters.

878

He wasn't using a BIble.

879
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,140
Then the Tooth Fairy
named the book to use.

880
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,140
He specified it in his note,
in the part Lecter tore out.

picked the book,

889

would have it in his cell.

what i'm doing,
Mr. Lounds?

1033
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:50,840
No.

1034
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,920
But i would like to.

1035
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,510
i really want to understand

1036
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,180
and then all my readers
could understand, too.

1037
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,850
i am not a man.

1038
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,230
i began as one

1039
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:06,270
but each being
that i change makes me

1040
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,230
more than a man,

1041
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,980
as you will witness.

1042
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,150
i don't need to see you. No.

1043
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,690
But you must, Mr. Lounds.

1044
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:16,280
You're a reporter.

1045
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,280
You're here to report.

1046
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,790
Open your eyes and look at me.

1047
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,960
No.

1048
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,880
if you won't open them,

1049
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,300
i'll staple your eyelids
to your forehead.

1050
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,760
No!

1051
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,550
Open your eyes!

1052
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:56,030
Oh, my dear God Jesus!

Oh, God !

1055
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,430
Do you want to know what i am?

1056
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,470
More than anything.

1057
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,770
i was afraid to ask.

1058
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,030
DOLARHYDE: Do you see now?

1059
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:40,320
Yeah, i see.

1060
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,780
Oh, God.

1061
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,740
Mrs. Jacobi in human form.

1062
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,580
Do you see?
Yes.

1063
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,870
Mrs. Leeds in human form.

1064
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,540
Do you see?
Yes.

1065
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,590
Mrs. Jacobi changing.
Oh, my God.

1066
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,800
Mrs. Leeds changing.

1067
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,340
Do you see?

1068
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,180
Mrs. Jacobi reborn.

1069
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,380
Do you see?

1070
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,430
Mrs. Leeds reborn.

1071
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,140
Do you see?
Please, no.

1072
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,350
No? No what?

1073
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:10,940
Not me.

1074
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,230
Why did you write lies,
Mr. Lounds?

1075
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,490
Graham told me to lie.

1076
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,160
lt wasn't me.

1077
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,660
Will you tell the truth now?
Yes!

1078
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,120
About me?

1079
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:31,250
My work?
Oh, yes.

1080
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:33,170

1081
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,420
Yeah.

i am the Dragon,
and you call me insane!

1083
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:44,430
You are privy
to a great becoming

1084
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,720
and you recognize nothing.

1085
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,980
You are an ant
in the afterbirth.

1086
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:53,560
lt is in your nature to
do one thing correctly.

1087
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,310
Before me,
you rightly tremble.

1088
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:01,030
But fear is not
what you owe me,
Mr. Lounds.

1089
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,660
You owe me awe.

1090
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,390

That's all, Mr. Lounds.

1092
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,180
You did very well.

1093
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,400
Will you let me go now?

1094
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,770
Soon.

1095
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,900
There's one more way
i can help you
to better understand.

1096
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,450
i want to understand.

1097
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:48,740
i do. And i'm really
gonna be fair from now on.

1098
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,620
You know that.

1099
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,590
Hello?

1103
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,450
LOUNDS: i have had
a great privilege.

1104
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,870
i have seen with

1105
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,670
wonder and awe the strength
of the great red dragon.

1106
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,800
he has helped me to
understand his splendor

1107
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,130
and now i want to serve him.

1108
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:51,720
he knows you made me lie,
will graham.

1109
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,600
because i was forced to lie

1110
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,730
he will be more merciful
to me than to you.

1111
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,480
hello?

1112
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,280
oh, god, no!

(LOUNDS SCREAMING IN PAIN
ON RECORDING)

1114
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:30,340
We can let this
tie us up in knots

1115
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,390
or we can learn from it.

1116
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:36,390
Maybe even use it
to catch the bastard.

1117
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,690
He had to have
a van or panei truck

1118
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,990
to move Lounds around
in that big old wheelchair.

1119
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,360
Go on.

1120
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,200
He had to already
have the wheelchair

1121
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,820
or know where
to get one fast.

1122
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:55,620
it's an antique,
not something
you'd find in the house.

1123
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,290
Does it strike anybody that
he set this up in a hurry?

1124
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:01,790
The tattler comes off
the press Monday night.

1125
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,000
By Tuesday morning
he's in Chicago,
snatching Lounds.

1126
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,260
He either lives
in the Chicago area

1127
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,760
or he's within
a driving radius of. . .

1128
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,380
Call it six hours.

1129
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,930
Find out in this area
where the tattler
was available

for early distribution
Monday night.

Start with airports,
all-night newsstands.

remembers an odd customer.

LLoyd, this cassette,
enhance the audio.

1134
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,690
Maybe you can pick up
something in the background.

1135
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:26,940
That wheelchair,

1136
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,400
i want the maker,
date, possible sources.

1137
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:31,490

coordinate from Chicago.

Look, there's not gonna be
any answers in Chicago, Jack.

Okay? i mean, Lounds,
that was a bonus.

That was a chance
to show off.

1142

lt doesn't even
fit his pattern.

1143
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:01,890
The Leeds and the Jacobis
are what he needs.

1144
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,860
i think i should
go back to Baltimore.

1145
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,530
After what he tried to pull?

1146
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:15,870
Lecter picked up on
something in the missing
part of the note.

1147
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,540
Not a name, but something,
enough to narrow the search.

1148
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:20,200
Even if he did,
he won't tell you.

1149
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:22,000
Not unless i can
offer him something.

1150
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,960
LECTER:
congratulations, will.

1151
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:29,630
That was most artistic,
the way you disposed
of Mr. Lounds.

1152
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:32,670
Your cell looks bigger
with no books in it.

1153
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,720
Does it?

1154
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,430
i hadn't noticed.

1155
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:36,840
Oh, you will.

1156
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,930
i have other resources.

1157
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,680
Tell me, Will.
Did you enjoy it?

1158
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,480
Your first murder?

1159
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:48,230
Of course you did.
Why shouldn't it feei good?

1160
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,940
lt does to God.

1161
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,650
Why, only last week in Texas,

1162
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:55,910
he dropped a church roof
on the heads of
34 of his worshippers

1163
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:58,320
as they were
groveling through a hymn.

1164
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:00,950
He wouldn't begrudge you
one journalist.

1165
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:03,330
Put me next to him, Doctor.

1166
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:05,080
You and some SWAT team?

1167
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,710
Oh, Will.
Where's the fun in that?

1168
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,040
He'll have to
take his chances, too.

1169
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,710
A roof can fall on anybody.

1170
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,720
But not on Molly and Josh,
i take it.

1171
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,470
Not yet, anyway.

1172
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,060
First he kills the pet,
then the family.

1173
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,810
Freddy was your pet.

1174
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,390
They're safe now.

1175
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,400
No one will ever be
safe around you, Will.

1176
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:42,330
Clever work on his note,
by the way.

1177
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,710
And that blackout was
an especially nice touch.

1178
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,960
What else was in that note,
Doctor?

1179
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:55,170
Put me next to him !

1180
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:57,180
That's what you want,
isn't it?

1181
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,220
To help him succeed
where you failed?

1182
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,510
Twice?

1183
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,850
GIve him a chance to kill me.

1184
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:05,850
Go on, then.

1185
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:08,100
Seduce me with your wares.

1186
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,810
Full restoration
of your privileges.

1187
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,780
Plus computer access
to the AMA archives.

1188
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,150
One hour a week
under supervision,
of course,

1189
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,820
but it's a one-time offer.

1190
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,320
lt expires the minute
i walk out of here.

1191
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,030
BIt measly, don't you think?

1192
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,240
Turn it down, then.
See what terms
you get from Chilton.

1193
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,040
Are these threats, William?

1194
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,540
i'm waiting, Doctor.
Or maybe you've got
nothing left to sell.

1195
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:38,930
A little sample, then.
Why not?

1196
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,760
Seen the Blake, have you?
Yes.

1197
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,850
No,
you've looked but not seen.

1198
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,850
Transformation is the key.

1199
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,810
The man-dragon,

1200
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,480
his ugliness
transformed by power.

1201
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:53,820
Look for a military record
with combat training.

1202
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,980
Look for extensive tattooing

1203
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:58,360
and corrective surgery,
most likely to the face.

1204
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,610
Come on, i'm past that
already and you know it.
