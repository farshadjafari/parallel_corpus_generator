00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,120
No, you've just never
been caught out before.

183
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,042
Hmm.

184
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,127
Hello, darling.

185
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,131
Sod you, then.

186
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,509
Oh, dear, picky,
picky, picky.

187
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,386
You're late.

188
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,596
I know.
It's all her fault.

189
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,603
Who's your friend?

190
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,646
Queen of Ireland,

191
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,815
love of my life,
mother of my child,

192
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,484
Caitlin Thomas.

193
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,612
Your wife, Dylan?

194
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,574
The one and only.

195
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,327
He didn't mention.

196
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,079
Well, he wouldn't...

197
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,373
would he?

198
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:15,340
You made that,
didn't you?

199
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,341
I might like you.

200
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:21,179
Then again, I might not.

201
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,516
I'll await your decision,
shall I?

202
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,520
I won't hold my breath, mind.

203
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,480
Got a mansion
we could share with you?

204
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,315
Yes, two little homeless orphans
you're looking at here.

205
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,109
I've only got a room.

206
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,860
Bugger.
Condemned to her sister's, then.

207
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,531
I'll be having that,
sailor boy.

208
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,701
- Needn't let-
- Small matter of a wife?

209
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,414
Nothing should ever
come between us.

210
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,833
Oh, God, Dylan.

211
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,377
Soul mates, we are, Vera,
always were.

212
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,837
Don't.

213
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,257
Stop talking about me.

214
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,554
There's a phone in the hall
where I stay, you know.

215
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,266
If you want me,
he's got my number.

216
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,648
What does it mean
when she smiles?

217
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,278
I don't know, never did.

218
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,071
[knocks on door]

219
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,451
God help us.

220
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,620
It's the Visigoths from Wales.

221
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,622
Your sister's here.

222
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,750
(Dylan)
Back from strangling Germans,

223
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,793
then, are you?

224
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,961
Left all the other little boys

225
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,463
playing with
their little pistols,

226
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,008
all ging-gang-gooley
and yo-ho-ho.

227
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,677
That what you call
poetry, is it?

228
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,055
Look, give us a bed and we'll stay out from under your feet.

229
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,684
(Vera)
♪ Maybe it's because ♪

230
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,523
♪ I kissed you too much ♪

231
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:06,451

[applause]

236
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,558
Sometimes I can nurse
a single pint all night.

237
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,893
But that's sometimes.

238
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,020
Thank you.

239
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,438
(man)
Oh, yeah!

240
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,233
I thought it was hilarious.

241
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,943
I'll get them in.

242
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,027
You pay, though, Vera, eh?

243
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,070
Fair dos.

244
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,197
Support the starving poet.

245
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,448
You are not a bloody poet,
Dylan.

246
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,742
You write films
about barrage sodding balloons

247
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,910
for your living.

248
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,495
There is a war on.

249
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,955
You know,
you're not the man I married.

250
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,791
I did cartwheels
in a rubber corset

251
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,335
in Peter Robinson's window
one time I was hungry.

252
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,378
You were never hungry.

253
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,338
You've always had a man
to feed you.

254
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,090
Demonstration purposes it was.

255
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,133
Bet you can't beat that.

256
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,427
Bet I can't.

257
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,807
He's following me.

258
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,020
Don't you have
all the luck.

259
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,438
Watch this.

260
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,951
Causing chaos, my lovely?

261
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,953
What do you need knickers for?
You've only got to wash them.

262
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,330
Looking for a good time

263
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,248
with a couple of showgirls,
are you?

264
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,461
Three more, please.

265
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,629
Your drinks are here, chaps.

266
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,756
Oh, chief stag's beaten off
the main competition.

267
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,926
William Killick.

268
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,183
Vera Phillips.
She's very pleased to meet you.

269
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,309
Rums all round?

270
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,477
Mmm, goody.

271
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,270
Four rums, please.

272
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,776
Do you do cartwheels?

273
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,985
On the seashore I might.

274
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,155
Ah, I'll take you there.

275
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,741
You're busy,
by the looks of you.

276
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,076
I could do
with a bit of sea air.

277
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,662
I'd like to sit
on the beach with you.

278
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,498
Don't you know a brush-off
when you get one?

279
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,667
(Caitlin)
Got any smokes?

280
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,336
I enjoyed your show.

281
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,340
- Did you?
- Yes.

282
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,717
- Hey?
- Hay's for horses.

283
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,678
Come for a gallop.

284
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,307
Used to call it busking,
singing in the tube stations.

285
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,435
Coppers used to move you on.

286
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,438
I'll come again,
if I may.

287
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,983
Free world.

288
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,611

00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,749
[laughter]

290
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,715
Keeping those rums to yourself?

291
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,383
We're in danger
of breaking a thirst.

292
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,551
(Vera)
I don't melt

293
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,386
at the sight of a uniform,
that's all.

294
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,055
Sod it.
I don't like nosy parkers.

295
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,016
(Caitlin)
It was a civil question.

296
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,809
I could have said,
"Are you after my husband?"

297
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,813
But I didn't.

298
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,898
Heartache, that's what I see
in a uniform.

299
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,944
I'm not gonna love someone
just to have them die off on me.

300
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,279
Who's talking about love?

301
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,405
Don't you ever get lonely?

302
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,199
My work's all I need.

303
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,617
I used to think
I'd be a dancer.

304
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,911
Danced night and day.

305
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,915
I know, you're one of those.

306
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,376
No.

307
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,628
No! God!

308
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,130
Not one of those,
for God's sake!

309
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,256
Not that I'm averse.

310
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,843
One of the ones that never
got over her first love.

311
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,555
'Course I am.

313
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,728
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

314
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,812
All I said-

315
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,731
You can walk on your own,
I know.

316
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,524
Keep your hand
on your ha'penny,

317
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,068
that's what
my mother taught me.

318
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,903
I'm not touching you.

319
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,197
Well, don't look at me either.

320
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,157
Fine.

321
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,911
No, don't do that!

322
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,831
What have you got against me,
Vera Phillips?

323
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,875
You might be dead tomorrow.

324
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:11,047
Live while you can,
live all you can.

325
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,757
I won't see you again.

326
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:18,096
Of course not.

327
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,515
I'd like my torch back.

328
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,814
Please.

329
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,535
Don't let the light out!

330
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,705
Light of your life.

331
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,042

before it comes back in again.

332

Go bark somewhere else.

(Dylan)
Come on, Catty.

337
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,288
Have you got a poem for me?

338
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,123
You still owe me
for the last one.

339
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,084
[laughs]

340
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,089
I am not a sodding
deposit box, Dylan.

341
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,516
What do you think this is?

342
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,063
- Well, it could be a scribble.
- Could be.

343
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,441
It could be
a bloody limerick, Dullun.

344
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,692
Could be.

345
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,283
Among Those Killed In The Dawn
Raid Was A Man Aged A Hundred.

346
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,534
Happy piece, is it?

347
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,829
Do you want to hear it?

348
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,789
Do you?

349
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,419
Do you want to hear it?

350
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,963
Oh, heavy.

351
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,474
"When the morning
was waking over the war,

00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,742
Lived.

Oh, no, it's-

He's a hundred
sodding years old!

362
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,459
He can't remember love.

363
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,460
For Christ's sake,

364
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,462
the bloody word's only there
because I bloody wrote it!

366

It's mine, isn't it?

368
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,686

369
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,313

370
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,649

378

and come and see
what he's done this time!

379
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,929
Oh, dear, naughty doggy Dylan.

380
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,682
Do you know what that is?

381
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,978
That's animal behavior,
that's what it is.

Hello,

386
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,530
is Vera Phillips there, please?

387
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,408
- Just a moment.
- Thank you.

[Vera on telephone]
Hello?

389
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,122
Hello, darling.

390

391
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,458
'Course it is.

392
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,296
There was a young hero
called Killick

393
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,797
who marched
to the top of a...

394

hillick.

395
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,011
He stood legs astride
and whipped out his pride

396
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,638
and spread Brylcreem
all over his fillick.

397
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,807
What's a fillick?

398
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,142
Oh, dear,

399
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,435
showing your ignorance now, Cat.

400
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,603
William will have a nice one,
whatever it is.

401
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,896
(Caitlin)
Not that you're

402
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,064
seeing him again.

403
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,190
He'll still have a nice one.

404
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,193
Come here, Vera Bera.

405
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,322
Come on,
come and have a cuddle.

406
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,159
Go on, you're welcome to it.

407
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,119
I don't want him.

408
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,048
Don't change, Vera Bera.

409
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,385
You're the star
in my dark sky.

410
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,552
Don't you ever change.

411
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,430
What am I in your sky?

412
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,140
You're on my earth,
Caitlin,

413
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,183
just where I want you to be.

414
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,226
Come on.

415
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,686

Oh, no, no.

425
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,095
It's like living with children.

- Oh, God!
- I'm going to the pub.

428

What's it like having a son?

429
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,365
Oh, exhausting.

430
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,660
I can't imagine it.

away from here...

You could die in an air raid.

(Vera)
I'm not going to.

435
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,178
You might.

436
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,805
This is not how I would choose
to seduce someone.

437
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,142
My firm intention
is to live forever.

438
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,560
Is that a promise?

439
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,437
Cross my heart.

440
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,825
You only think
you're in love with the poet.

441
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,495
You know that,
don't you?

442
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,496
His name's Dylan.

443
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,122
You can say Dylan,
can't you?

444
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,707
So, you admit
you're in love with him?

445
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,334
What are you,
a bloody lawyer, are you?

446
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,960
I'm not saying
I'm the better man,

447
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,297
but I'm not married,
Vera.

448
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,759
And you'll admit
that gives me an advantage.

449
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,594
I'll admit nothing.

450
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,347
On the grounds
that it may incriminate you?

451
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,141
You're trying to provoke me,
aren't you?

452
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,314
First love's all right
as far as it goes.

453

I'm interested in.

so damn wise.

wanting.

I am put on this earth

to nurture his talent,

472

have his children,

quietly in the night,

00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,678
in the body bereft."

907
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:25,487
Come on.

908
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,032
Sleep tight.

909
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,620
- I'm hungry.
- Shh.

910
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,664
Baby is sleeping.

911
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,594
It's bloody freezing.

912
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,929
Bloody Wales.

913
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,478
When I was little, my da always
used to warm me like this.

914
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,271
You loved him?

915
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,939
Adored him.

916
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,191
I hated mine.

917
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,901
You didn't hate him,
not hate.

918
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,737
He was loathsome.

919
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,073
Pity you're not a man.

920
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,741
If you were a man,
I'd fancy you.

921
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,453
[snickering]

922
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,789
Don't think I didn't
know you were there.

923
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,831
I didn't.

924
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,291
I could smell him.

925
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,626
Come here, Dylan.

926
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,461
Let Vera smell you,

927
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,462
smell the woman on you.

928
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:24,505
Stop it.

929
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,131
She thinks I should twiddle
my thumbs while she-

930
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,800
What?

931
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,593
What?

932
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,677
Don't wake the kids, Dylan.

933
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,471
So where are they,
Caitlin, hmm?

934
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,680
Where are
your little friends?

935
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,224
Come on, boys,
out you come.

936
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,268
Feeding time.

937
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,311
Ow!

938
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,979
She's killing me, Vera!

939
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,981
I will kill you!
I will!

940
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,858
If I catch you at it again,
I will!

941
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,443
Why don't you see to the kids,
Caitlin?

942
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,486
Go on.

943
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,822
[children crying]

944
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,865
Why do you do it?

945
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:55,869
I don't do anything.

946
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:59,706
I do it,
sleep with other women...

947
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,292
- Hello.
- Morning.

948
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,379
Because I'm a poet,
and a poet feeds off life.

949
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,214
[chuckles]

950
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,257
What?

951
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,801
Pompous sod, aren't you?

952
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,887
I do it because she does it.

953
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,722
She always has.

954
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,932
She can't help herself.

955
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,102
It doesn't mean anything to her.

956
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,396
You don't need William.

957
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,023
You've got me.

958
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,317
Nothing but you and me
with time on our hands

959
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,736
and each other
to spend it with.

960
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,490
[door creaks open]

961
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,371
Hello, Daisy.

962
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,005
Come back with me.

963
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,799
Come on.

964
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:55,262
I'll take you back
to a time when we were safe,

965
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,347
where no bombs fell
from the sky,

966
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,267
and no one died,
ever.

967
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:05,856
You can't go back.

968
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,734
We can.

969
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,528
You and me.

970
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,323
It's not real.

971
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,742
It is if we want it to be.

972
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,219
Pity about
the poor bloody husband.

973
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,929
Off bleeding
for his country

974
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,430
and paying for the fun
back home.

975
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,894
Don't mind if I join you,
do you?

976
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:15,592
(woman)
Room for a small one?

977
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,096
Ooh, wartime luxury.

978
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,361
[shouting]

979
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,323
(woman)
You can drop me here.

980
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,285
[horn honking]

981
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,621
[screams]

982
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:48,500
- Cat?
- That looks nasty.

983
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,253
Catty, Catty.
Cat, Cat, Cat.

984
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,714
Cat, Catty.

985
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:58,760
God, you're drunk
in charge of a bike.

986
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,887
And what are you
drunk in charge of?

987
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,601
(man)
Am I hurting you?

988
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,768
(Dylan)
You can't hurt her.

989
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,103
She's got skin like
a rhinoceros hide.

990
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,278
We're only friends,
Dylan and me,

991
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:19,615
you know that,
don't you?

992
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,618
Don't ever lie to me.

993
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,245
I won't. Not ever.

994
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,623
Friends don't lie
to each other.

995
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:28,749
Still as you can now.

996
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,971
Tell him to come back, Rowatt.

997
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:51,605
Tell your daddy
to come back to me.

998
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,149
Think he sees it, lovely?

999
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:57,110
Your daddy?

1000
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:01,490
You think he sees the rain?

1001
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,699
Hmm?

1002
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,826
(boy)
Mama, Dada.

1003
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,536
(Dylan)
Caitlin, shut it up!

1004
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,997
You're its father!
Play with him!

1005
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,040
That's what he wants.

1006
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,458
I'm writing!

1007
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,876
Damn it, Dylan.

1008
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,796
Daddy! Mummy!

1009
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,756
That's my only-

1010
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,758
Dada.

1011
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,884
That's my only draft!

1012
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,053
You'll find it
in the cesspit, then,

1013
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,179
along with my only life!

1014
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,847
Cat! Cat!

1015
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,642
Cat!

1016
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:08,223
(Dylan)
When I was a windy boy and a bit

1017
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,852
and the black spit
of the chapel fold,

1018
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:19,067
sighed the old ram rod
dying of women,

1019
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,654
I tiptoed shy
in the gooseberry wood.

1020
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,825
The rude owl cried
like a telltale tit.

1021
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:30,120
I skipped in a blush
as the big girls rolled

1022
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:34,040
ninepin down
on the donkeys' common.

1023
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,586
And on seesaw Sunday nights
I wooed

1024
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,922
whoever I would
with my wicked eyes.

1025
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,550
The whole of the moon
I could love and leave...

1026
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,051
For God's sake,

1027
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,595
don't wake Rowatt.

1028
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,054
[whispering]
All the green-leaved

1029
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,765
little weddings' wives

1030
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:55,061
in the coal black bush
and let them grieve.

1031
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,483
Wash my back for me?

1032
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,287
There is nothing
like a proper sponge.

1033
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,168
Give us a kiss,
Vera Phillips.

1034
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,961
Give us a penny,
then.

1035
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,421
I haven't got a penny.

1036
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,551
Like we used to be.

1037
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:30,138
Little dog says,
"Play with me."

1038
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:34,392
That's all you'll get.

1039
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,520
And don't you wet
my jumper.

1040
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,979
We've had baths together before.

1041
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,148
We were children then.

1042
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,441
I made love to you
on a beach.

1043
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:45,028
Once, and it was cold.

1044
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,071
So lonely.

1045
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,739
Not for you.

1046
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,032
Aching with it,
you are.

1047
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,075
No, Dylan.

1048
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,368
No what?

1049
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,286
Don't make mischief.

1050
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:56,164
There's no harm in it.

1051
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,875
You're getting me wet.

1052
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:04,297
Walk away, then.

1053
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,967
Go on, Vera Phillips.

1054
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:10,136
Hmm? Walk away.

1055
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,515
You want us all to love you.

1056
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,809
So I can love you back.

1057
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,027
All right, then.

1058
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:29,281
Love me.

1059
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,229
[screaming]

1060
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,564
Look at me.
I'm soaking!

1061
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,649
Shh!

1062
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,728
Vera!

1063
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,744
Hello.

1064
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,550
(Caitlin)
Where have you been?

1065
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,428
Nowhere.

1066
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,102
I'm going to make laver bread.

1067
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,773
Look.

1068
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,902
No, don't.

1069
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:59,199
Have you been crying?

1070
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,118
They're sending William home.

1071
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,377
I've never seen a man
love anyone

1072
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,213
the way I saw
that man love you.

1073
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,049
I'm not that me anymore.

1074
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:24,265
I've got Rowatt.

1075
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,935
Just tell him you love him,
Vera.

1076
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,105
What if it's too late?

1077
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,318
It's never too late.

1078
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:44,619
It's cold! It's cold!

1079
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,454
Of course it's bloody cold!

1080
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,249
Catty!

1081
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:59,592
I'm pregnant, you know.

1082
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:03,138
Oh, God, Cat.

1083
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,598
Whose is it?

1084
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,977
Don't know.

1085
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:09,978
Can't have it,
of course.

1086
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,729

01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:42,433
I held a boy while my sergeant
hacked his arm off.

1266
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,935
Later I held him
while he died.

1267
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:47,646
British boy, he was.

1268
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,523
That was in Greece.

1269
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:51,316
I beg your pardon?

1270
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,193
We fight...

1271
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:56,739
out there...

1272
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,824
so you and your friends can-

1273
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:01,452
can sit around in Hampstead
and theorize.

1274
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:02,953
You do that

1275
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:06,206
while we bleed
our lives away.

1276
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:09,752
What do you know about war?

1277
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:14,423
You people,
what do you know about war, hmm?

1278
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:20,262
Drink up, boys and girls,

1279
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,431
drink up.

1280
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,184
Introduce me to your
knowledgeable friends, Dylan.

1281
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,810
Please, introduce me.

1282
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:27,978
I'd be charmed
to meet them.

1283
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:29,897
I'll introduce you
just as soon as you calm down.

1284
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,648
Oh, you can take my money.

1285
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,358
Hmm?

1286
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:34,568
You can take my bloody money,

1287
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:36,570
but you can't even introduce me
to your friends?

1288
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,032
Ha! I'm just a bloody Tommy.

1289
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,283
[bell rings]

1290
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,326
Time, gentlemen!

1291
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,828
Gentlemen, please.
It's time.

1292
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:46,663
- Whisky, double.
- Time's called.

1293
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,957
Are you refusing to serve me?

1294
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,793
- I said time's called.
- What do you mean, time?

1295
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,836
Go home, Captain Killick.

1296
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,382
No, don't you laugh at me.

1297
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:00,886
Oh, play the big man.

1298
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,679
Come on.

1299
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,681
Easy in front of a woman,
isn't it?

1300
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:06,475
We only have
your word for it

1301
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:09,269
that you weren't
skulking at the back

1302
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:13,148
with urine
running down your leg.

1303
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:19,321
William, come on.

1304
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:22,282
Don't bother with them,
Captain Killick.

1305
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,827
Best off home.

1306
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:42,886
[laughter]

1307
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:51,353
William?
What in heaven's name?

1308
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:52,396
Take your hands off me.

1309
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:55,649
- Put it down!
- Please, take your hands off.

1310
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:56,942
Put the damn thing down!

1311
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:59,987
Vera!

1312
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,072
Vera?

1313
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:05,200
Vera?

1314
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:19,506
Give me words,
and I'm a giant.

1315
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:21,800
Above all women.

1316
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:24,678
Hmm? Words.

1317
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:25,846
Beyond the bottle.

1318
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,348
More than love.
Better than sex.

1319
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,101
Words...

1320
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:32,352
for me.

1321
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:34,062
Hmm?

1322
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:39,151
(Dylan)
Shall I tell you about

1323
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:42,112
our first night together
at the Wheatsheaf?

1324
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,699
She offered her honor,
so I honored her offer.

1325
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,159
All that long,
I've got her on offer.

1326
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:48,744
[laughter]

1327
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,495
Very easily entertained,
this one.

1328
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:51,997
Thinks a pint of Guinness
with a potato in it

1329
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,373
is a cocktail.

1330
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:56,001
Don't you, my darling?

1331
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,461
[gun cocks]

1332
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:58,629
[gunshot]

1333
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,510
(Vera)
William, no!

1334
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,553
No! No!

1335
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:09,681
[gunshots]

1336
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,148
No!

1337
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:19,399
No! No! No!

1338
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:20,525
[gunshot]

1339
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,027
William, no, stop, please.

1340
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:23,695
Please stop!

1341
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:26,615
[child crying]

1342
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,741
No one here means you any harm.

1343
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:29,785
Please.

1344
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:32,663
Don't you care?

1345
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,542
Your husband and my wife.

1346
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:49,596
My son.

1347
01:28:03,152 --> 01:28:06,113
You've got a bruise.

1348
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,365
Take me home.

1349
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:10,742
Did I do that?

1350
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:13,287
[child crying]

1351
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:14,830
Take her home, William.

1352
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,626
Not without my gun.

1353
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,964
Give me the gun...

1354
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,550
or I'll pull the pin on this

1355
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:29,386
and kill the lot of us.

1356
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:32,306
My son.

1357
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,146
What'd you give it to her for,
you daft sod?

1358
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:44,359
(man)
There isn't a pin in it,

1359
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:45,527
William.

1360
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,073
Either it's faulty or...

1361
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:51,241
it's just gone off,

1362
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:53,994
and we're standing here dead,
looking at it.

1363
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,039
[child crying]

1364
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,292
(boy)
Mommy!

1365
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:04,963
[crying continues]

1366
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,715
Look, the boy's screaming.

1367
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:18,226
Come home, William.

1368
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,728
William.

1369
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,884
(Dylan)
All they care about is

1370
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,804
keeping the lid on it, but...

1371
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,431
that's Wales for you.

1372
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,475
Doesn't want the world
knowing its business.

1373
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:00,685
I mean,
we could have been killed.

1374
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,814
Cat.

1375
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,191
I haven't got any more money.

1376
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,991
I've nothing left, Dylan.

1377
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:05,041
Got your toe.

1378
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,711
Got your toe.

1379
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:31,943
Can I...

1380
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:35,071
Hold him, then.

1381
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:47,250
See?

1382
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:49,628
You won't hurt him.

1383
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:59,930
Thank you.

1384
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:05,101
Shall we take him out?

1385
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:10,899
Now.

1386
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,083
You're an expert.

1387
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,297
Eyelashes like feathers,

1388
01:32:34,423 --> 01:32:35,757
like yours.

1389
01:32:36,759 --> 01:32:37,968
[knocks on door]

1390
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:40,053
Captain Killick,
it's the police.

1391
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:41,096
Open up.

1392
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,932
Oh, God.

1393
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:46,268
One way
to get rid of me, eh?

1394
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,520
William.

1395
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,772
I love you.

1396
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:55,694
Come here.

1397
01:33:39,488 --> 01:33:41,197
(Caitlin)
Don't think I don't understand.

1398
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:44,284
His kind of violence, I mean.

1399
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:46,953
I do.

1400
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:49,956
It's just I've never had
a Sten gun handy.

1401
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:54,127
Tea's got scum on it.

1402
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,590
He's a beauty.

1403
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:03,970
Does William think he's Dylan's?

1404
01:34:07,099 --> 01:34:09,351
Is he Dylan's?

1405
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,770
No.

1406
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,816
I've used up all the sugar.

1407
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:23,198
Were you sleeping with him?

1408
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:28,328
I love my husband.

1409
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,461
I should kill you.

1410
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:41,049
You're my friend.

1411
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:42,175
For lying...

1412
01:34:42,301 --> 01:34:45,929
I mean.

1413
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:53,937
For lying to me, Vera.

1414
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:20,839
You look smart.

1415
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,298
Quite your old self.

1416
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:31,099
(man)
I recovered

1417
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,601
five empty bullet cases from the gravel.

1418
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:36,479
The walls being made
of wood and asbestos,

1419
01:35:36,605 --> 01:35:38,440
the bullets had penetrated
through to the living room,

1420
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:39,983
where I also found

1421
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:42,318
five more
empty bullet cases.

1422
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:46,281
All with him,
aren't they?

1423
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,657
The whole bloody village.

1424
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:49,534
I'm the bard, aren't I?

1425
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:50,577
They've only just met him.

1426
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:51,619
Shh.

1427
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,830
(man)
A revolver, a grenade,

1428
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:56,916
and 100 rounds
of 9-millimeter ammunition.

1429
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,004
(man)
Used to lay minefields,

1430
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,006
Captain Killick.

1431
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,259
When he left an area, though,

1432
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:10,430
he used to dig up
the mines he'd laid.

1433
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:11,556
(Dylan)
Why don't you take

1434
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:12,640
the witness box

1435
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,809
and sing Killick's praises
to his judgeship?

1436
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:16,311
Why don't you do that?

1437
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:17,353
Everybody loves a hero.

1438
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,438
(man)
Are you telling me

1439
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:19,898
Captain Killick didn't know

1440
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,649
he had to hand in
his weapons?

1441
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:22,776
(man)
Captain William Killick

1442
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:23,818
is an expert marksman.

1443
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:25,278
If he'd been intent on murder,

1444
01:36:25,404 --> 01:36:26,696
he couldn't possibly
have failed.

1445
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:27,781
'd be obliged
if you confine yourself

1446
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:29,532
to answering
the questions I ask,

1447
01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:31,993
Lieutenant Colonel.

1448
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,411
(Dylan)
Scratch my head, Cat.

1449
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:35,955
Can't.

1450
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:46,800
(man)
Is there any reason

1451
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:48,802
why a man of your rank

1452
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:51,971
should strike a woman
in the face?

1453
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:53,515
No, sir.

1454
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:55,391
Why did you go to the Thomas
bungalow so late at night?

1455
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:59,187
I have no idea why.

1456
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:00,313
They cut me dead.

1457
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:03,316
I suppose
they didn't want to see

1458
01:37:03,442 --> 01:37:05,026
the goose that lay
the golden egg.

1459
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:09,322
I thought I'd show them
that war is real.

1460
01:37:09,448 --> 01:37:12,700
I could see there was
no one in my line of fire,

1461
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,828
so I fired at a partition.

1462
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:17,622
I never imagined the bullets
would penetrate the wall.

1463
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:19,207
The walls were asbestos,
Captain Killick.

1464
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,209
I didn't know that.

1465
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,670
I wanted to frighten them, that's all.

1466
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,922
There was a child present.

1467
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:32,679
Is-is that a question, sir?

1468
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:47,610
I can't live without him.

1469
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:49,696
Did you know
the entire unit were killed

1470
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,949
when they
went back out there?

1471
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:55,076
Wiped out.

1472
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:57,996
That would have been him.

1473
01:37:58,122 --> 01:38:00,623
I'm begging you
to help him.

1474
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:03,918
It saved his life,
this trial.

1475
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,004
Did him a favor.

1476
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,384
Dylan...

1477
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:12,719
please.

1478
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,484
You were the star in my sky.

1479
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:33,448
You can't stay the same
all your life.

1480
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,702
I can.

1481
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:42,790
You'll help him, won't you?

1482
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:46,836
It means that much to you?

1483
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:51,466
William's my world,

1484
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,636
him and Rowatt.

1485
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:56,763
I've no room
for anyone else.

1486
01:38:56,889 --> 01:39:02,685
I don't want anyone else.

1487
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:11,694
I see.

1488
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,739
I do, I see.

1489
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:25,124
(man)
Mr. Thomas?

1490
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:41,933
Captain Killick and I
were no more than acquaintances.

1491
01:39:44,436 --> 01:39:46,562
We would occasionally stand
next to each other at the bar.

1492
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:49,732
Captain Killick
was stone-cold sober

1493
01:39:49,858 --> 01:39:50,817
on the night of the shooting,

1494
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:55,154
and it is my firm belief
that he tried to kill me,

1495
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,448
that he tried to kill my wife,

1496
01:39:57,574 --> 01:40:00,702
and that he tried
to kill my son.

1497
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:08,042
(Vera)
Why?

1498
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:12,338
You.

1499
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:15,675
Leave Caitlin.

1500
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:18,177
Go on.

1501
01:40:18,303 --> 01:40:21,222
Leave Caitlin.

1502
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:22,557
You've got rid
of the opposition.

1503
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:25,685
Now you come on.

1504
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:29,689
Leave your wife
and live with me.

1505
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:40,158
Do you see?

1506
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:45,204
You want a 15-year-old girl
back on the beach,

1507
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:49,375
not me.

1508
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:53,796
You don't even see me,
do you, Dylan?

1509
01:40:57,801 --> 01:41:03,556
All you've got
is stories in your head, words.

1510
01:41:03,682 --> 01:41:07,977
And I have to be real.

1511
01:41:08,103 --> 01:41:12,398
William makes me real.

1512
01:41:19,823 --> 01:41:25,912
If you have sent
my beloved husband to jail...

1513
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:28,915
I will never forgive you.

1514
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:52,188
It is my opinion

1515
01:41:52,314 --> 01:41:54,190
that it is not
an innocent hand

1516
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:56,651
that wields a gun
against a civilian household.

1517
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:00,363
It is, however,
your peers who judge you,

1518
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:01,531
Captain Killick,

1519
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:04,117
and not I.

1520
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:05,701
They have found
that there is no evidence

1521
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:09,372
to support the charge
of attempted murder.

1522
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:11,040
I have, therefore,
no choice

1523
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:16,129
but to pronounce you free to go.

1524

There's that smile.

1527
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:39,063
I never meant to hurt you.

1528
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:42,858
Might as well, I suppose.

1529
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:46,570
Smile, I mean.

1530
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:47,697
Write, Catty.

1531
01:44:49,324 --> 01:44:51,242
I'll leave that to Dylan.

1532
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:53,244
Write to me.

1533
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:08,676
Don't be lonely.

1534
01:45:13,515 --> 01:45:15,725
Don't you, Catty.

1535
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:21,480
Don't you.

1536
