00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,124
- What did you run into me for?
- I didn't mean to, that guy pushed me.

3
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,749
What are you doing here?

4
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:07,791
I'm going to tell you something.
I want you to listen to me, OK?

5
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,666
This is not your country.

6
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,416
Help!

7
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,833
Get the yellow fuck!

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,083
Fuck off!

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,083
Fucking squinty! Fuck him!

10
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:30,416
Fuck him!

11
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,874
One, two...

12
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,499
Get him!

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,708
You like it, gooky boy?

14
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,374
Fuck off!

15
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,083
Hurry, your brother needs the pot.

16
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,291
- What happened?
- Fucking skinheads!

17
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,958
They bashed Long, Vinh and my sister.

18
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,333
Look, my sister's blood.

19
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,333
Come on. We'll get some payback.

20
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:02,458
All the guys from the factory are with us.

21
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,958
But we're going to need more wheels,
so bring your car.

22
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,958
The skinheads would all be gone by now.

23
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,958
We'll find them, sooner or later.

24
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,166
Well? My sister worked for you
and your father. Remember?

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,499
Doesn't that mean anything?

26
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,124
Dad will kill us
if he knows we left the car.

27
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,249
He's right.

28
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,208
Yeah? Yeah?

29
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,041
Forget them, Tiger.

30
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:31,791
Chicken shit.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,124
I'll help. Can I come?

32
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,583
Forget it, shrimp.

33
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,958
Where is he? Inside?

34
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,791
Yeah, he hasn't come out
but he's expecting you.

35
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,041
That was Pommy Bill.
He's come to help.

36
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,958
- He hurt you?
- No.

37
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,291
But he's been hitting the rohys again.
It's the worst I've ever seen him.

38
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,041
Are you all right?

39
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:22,458
Perhaps if you stop struggling, Sir...

40
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:24,999
Have it your way.

41
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:32,374
Do you like punching up little girls, Sir?
Do junkies like punching up little girls?

42
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,541
- Have you been taking the Phenytoin?
- Yeah.

43
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,249
Then where is it?

44
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,124
I don't know. I'm busy.

45
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,541
You haven't, have you?

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,583
- Seizures been bad?
- No.

47
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:58,374
You've got a bloody chemist shop here.
You'll fry your brains with this stuff.

48
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,083
And the one drug you really need,
you don't bother with.

49
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,541
I need some money, Martin.

50
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,833
Come on now.

51
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,833
Shut up!

52
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:14,999
It's your game anyway,
you stupid...

53
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,249
Get away from me, you bastard!
I'll fucking kill you!

54
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,333
Missed you badly.

55
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,249
I don't want that.

56
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,791
Can't you just be nice to me?

57
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,833
Pick up your things
and let's get out of here.

58
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:56,499
Get away from me, you bastard!
I'm going to fucking kill you!

59
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,333
I can't stay with you,
Martin, come on.

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,958
Fuck off!

61
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,958
You're the one who always starts it.

62
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,124
- All right!
- Hey, boys!

63
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,249
Tracy!

64
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,041
Sorry.

65
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,249
The men are here.
The big men have arrived.

66
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,416
Come here, you!

67
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:34,291
Piss off!

68
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,958
Fuck off!

69
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,624
Hey, we need your muscle.
Rob and Chris have kicked us out the squat.

70
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:47,874
Three jugs, Harold.

71
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:51,249
- Fucking Rob hit me too.
- Are you going to stomp 'em for us, Davey?

72
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,791
Hey! Get him out!

73
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,208
Come on. I'm not serving
any bloody kids. Get him out!

74
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,499
If he doesn't leave,
I turn off the beer.

75
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,749
Now!

76
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,833
OK, Bubs, piss off.

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,791
Come on, out you go!

78
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,749
Get your mother to read you a story.

79
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,291
Piss off, Bubs!

80
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,374
Go home!

81
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,583
Hey, Rollo says you had
some gooks in here last week.

82
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,083
- What's it to you?
- What were they doing here?

83
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:27,499
- This is our place, mate.
- No, this is my fucking place, mate!

84
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,416
Yeah, but you had gooks here.

85
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,374
Doesn't bother me.

86
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,783
You got a problem with that,
that's your fucking problem.

87
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,083
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

88
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,791
Never seen her before.

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,791
- Bit of a space monster, if you ask me.
- You mean space cadet.

90
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,749
Hey, mate,
you gonna give us a drink?

91
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,333
Come on, mate.
Come on, give us a drink.

92
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,208
Fuck!

93
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,999
Your breath smells like shit.

94
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,208
- Hey, can we go?
- What did you just call me?

95
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,041
Hey, what did you just call me?

96
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:39,041
- Just leave it. Let's just go.
- Don't lean on my face!

97
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,874
Davey!

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,499
Get off me!

99
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:09,541
- Do you surrender?
- Yeah, fucking whatever, I surrender.

100
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,124
Motherfucker!

101
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,458
You're getting better, Davey.

102
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,166
Gee, look at that jacket.

103
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,583
It's beautiful!

104
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,083
You want that jacket?

105
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,499
Move!

106
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,208
- Nice jacket.
- Yeah.

107
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,749
Well, I hope it was worth it.

108
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,374
It's bleeding.

109
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,624
It's not even deep.

110
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,124
Got a bit of glass in it, though.

111
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,333
Do you want me to operate?

112
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,541
It's still bleeding.

113
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,041
This is pretty clean.

114
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,041
This is home.

115
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:06,958
- Yeah, what is this, a squat?
- Squat be fucked! We pay rent for this.

116
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:08,958
Let me show you this.

117
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,833
What is this?

118
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:03,208
Do you love me?

119
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,166
So you're awake.

120
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,499
Brought my bag up from downstairs.

121
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,374
I didn't get to salvage much
from the place where I was living.

122
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,791
Some idiot tore it all up.

123
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,249
These are for tap dancing. See?

124
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,374
But they don't fit me anymore.

125
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:56,333
That's a picture of my mum.
Isn't she beautiful?

126
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,541
Everyone says I look like her.

127
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,166
Not saying I'm good-looking.
I'm not saying that.

128
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,374
But we do look alike.

129
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,999
She's dead now.

130
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,958
It was a car accident.

131
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,124
She had her head chopped off.

132
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,624
I think it's good to be able to talk about
these things without cracking up, you know?

133
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:27,791
Besides...
I know she's still with me somehow.

134
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,083
I think, that when I have kids,
she'll be one of them.

135
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,958
You know, sort of reincarnated.

136
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,291
What are you doing?

137
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,666
Why don't you fucking keep your mind
on the fucking job, woman?

138
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,791
What?

139
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,624
Hando, Magoo.

140
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,749
- Magoo!
- Way to go!

141
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,666
Fucking Magoo.
What are you doing here?

142
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,458
Didn't have time
to tell you we were coming.

143
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,874
Didn't know we were coming, actually.
Just kept on driving.

144
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,624
Forgot to fucking stop!

145
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,291
Check this out!

146
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,333
Joined up a couple of months ago.

147
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,749
What for?

148
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,874
Needed a job, didn't I?

149
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:52,958
They put you through school.

150
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,708
- Still get to keep the hair short.
- You look like a fucking hippie!

151
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:02,833
Fuck!

152
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,833
I thought you wanted
to shoot guns, mate.

153
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,208
I want to get in a fucking sub.

154
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,749
Fire torpedoes.

155
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,999
How are you?
We're the handsome Canberra boys.

156
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,624
Come to see
the ugly Melbourne boys.

157
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,749
This is my mate Magoo.

158
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,249
That's Jacqui.

159
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,749
And that's Flea.

160
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:28,041
Hi.

161
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,874
Got something for you, boys.

162
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,791
Macka pulled it from
the basement of the war museum.

163
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,208
Standard issue for the Hitler Youth.

164
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:44,249
Cheap alloy. Doesn't look that good.
They were made towards the end of the war.

165
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,708
They were running out
of metal then, weren't they?

166
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,999
You don't want it?

167
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,458
- I'll take it.
- Fifty bucks.

168
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,416
Thirty.

169
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,749
Forty then.

170
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,499
Come on, Davey,
you're robbing me of fifty, mate.

171
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,374
That's all I got.
How long are you staying for?

172
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,791
Come on.

173
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,166
Here. Pay me back
next dole cheque.

174
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,291
- Magoo!
- Champ, man!

175
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:20,804
- Hey, how's Billy?
- Can I have look, Dave?

176
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,416
- He got Eileen up the duff.
- It looks all right.

177
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:25,124
- It'll be all right.
- Tommy's going to kill him.

178
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,708
I'll change that bandage
for you later on.

179
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,249
He's going to fucking kill him!

180
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,249
Any parties happening
in this shitty town?

181
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,541
Orr, Bubsy!

182
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,499
Oy, Davey! Cop a drink!

183
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,583
Nice party, mate.

184
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,958
I've got to get
the first bus back to base.

185
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:18,208
You enjoy being cannon fodder
for the system?

186
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:21,958
It's a job.

187
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,666
See you, Hando.

188
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,166
Hey, Flea.

189
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:54,708
You look like shit, Davey.

190
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,624
Stupid little bugger.

191
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,732
Why do you go in for all this stuff?

192
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,360
Because I don't want to be
a white coolie in my own country.

193
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,166
Because it's not our country anymore.
Because rich people...

194
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,291
and powerful people brought in
boatloads of human trash.

195
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,291
Cheap labour.

196
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:26,166
Gooks mainly.
And there's going to be more.

197
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,874
I want people to know that I'm proud
of my white history and my white blood.

198
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,333
One day, it might be all I have.

199
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,958
But I don't want to go
the same way as the fucking Abbo.

200
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,208
See that map?

201
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:55,749
That's all the gook properties
in Barclay Street.

202
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,958
A few years ago
that was a white area.

203
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,124
"Mein Kampf."

204
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,958
- Do you know it?
- It's about war, isn't it?

205
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,124
This book was written by Adolf Hitler.

206
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:28,899
Got turned into a joke by people who don't
want you to know Hitler's view of the world.

207
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:31,249
It's simply about...

208
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,560
the on-going struggle of the white race
and the enemies it faces.

209
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:41,541
If you don't know who the enemy is,
you can't win the war.

210
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:43,874
Listen.

211
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:50,416
"All the noble cultures
of the past declined"

212
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,708
because the purity and vigour

213
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,749
of the originally
created race faded out.

214
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:00,124
They were compromised
by the seed of lesser races

215
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,499
who were attracted to
the works of the superior men.

216
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:07,416
The undeniable reason
for their decline

217
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:12,291
was then due to a kind of
racial blood poisoning.

218
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,291
"Racial blood must then be preserved
in it's purity at all costs."

219
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,708
Well, how does it feel to own a pub?

220
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,708
It's a dump.

221
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,041
Shut up.

222
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:10,874
The money will be transferred
to your account in thirty days.

223
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,708
Did you finalize your plans
for the old place?

224
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:18,124
We will turn the place
to a restaurant with bar.

225
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:21,083
For my sons to run
when a little older.

226
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,166
If they are smart enough.

227
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,249
Well.

228
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:32,708
- You're going to root it, Bubsy.
- I don't care. Fuck Harold!

229
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:38,416
I'm just going out for
about an hour. Mister...

230
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:41,541
- his sons want to have a look around.
- All right.

231
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:52,874
Ten metres.

232
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:56,083
Ten metres by twelve.

233
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:57,958
Can we keep
one of these tables at home?

234
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:03,291
What do you want it for?
You're a lousy player.

235
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:05,874
Do something useful.

236
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:10,708
Go and get us some lunch.

237
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,333
And remember,
no greasy souvlaki shit.

238
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,541
This red's going to do
lovely things for your eyes.

239
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:22,999
- Just watch my makeup, OK?
- All right, don't move then.

240
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,999
What are you eating that rubbish for?
You got rocks in your head? Geez!

241
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,124
I'm not living with no fat bitch.

242
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,249
Hando!
Gooks down at the Railway Hotel!

243
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,833
- Stop there!
- But I want to come!

244
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,583
Stay here! Piss off, Bubs!

245
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,833
Fuck you, you bastards!

246
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,791
Fuck you, I'm going!

247
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,416
Do you want to come?

248
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:35,874
How you going?

249
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:53,999
Right!

250
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:55,999
Shut up!

251
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,291
Time to die, gook!
Time to fucking die!

252
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:15,958
Let's break some fingers.

253
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,499
Tiger! Fucking skinheads!

254
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,291
They've got my brothers.

255
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,874
Get the guys. Get the guys.
Skinheads!

256
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,999
What are you doing here, Bubs?
You were told not to come here! God!

257
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,458
Fuck off, shithead!
Let me through!

258
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,624
Fuck me!

259
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:01,499
What's happening?

260
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,041
What are you doing here?

261
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:06,458
Why don't you bloody well do
what you're told, woman?

262
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,687
- I thought I told you to stay at the shop.
- They're only kids!

263
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:10,666
Who says?

264
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:14,083
We hate you, gook.
We'll never let you go.

265
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,291
This is our place, gook boy. Our place.
What are you doing here?

266
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,041
The only thing for you here is pain.

267
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:24,749
We don't love you.

268
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,166
You understand?

269
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:30,291
I hope you do, mate,
because I don't speak monkey talk!

270
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,749
Give him smack in head, special.

271
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,833
Maybe you got him
enough now, Hando.

272
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,791
- Hit one of them.
- Go on, go for it.

273
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:46,416
Hando!

274
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:01,958
Hando! There's gooks!
There's thousands of them!

275
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,124
Monkeys! Monkeys!

276
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:39,999
How do you like it?
Do you fucking like it, man?

277
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:43,874
Do you fucking like it?

278
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,791
Brett!

279
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,083
Wait for Brett, you bastards!

280
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:03,416
- Come on!
- Fuck!

281
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,958
Fuck this, bastards!
Fucking dogs!

282
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:07,999
Fucking move!

283
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,416
Come on, you wankers!

284
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:43,374
Fucking move!

285
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:32,749
You fucking yellow bastards!
Fuck you!

286
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,083
What happened?
What are we going to do?

287
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,708
There's fucking thousands of them!

288
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,333
- There's millions of them!
- Shut up!

289
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,999
- Shut up, I said!
- They got Champ, Luke and Magoo.

290
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,124
And Brett!

291
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:48,812
Why didn't you all stop and help?
What did you keep running for?

292
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:50,249
What do you expect?

293
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:55,083
You fucking little dickhead!
There's fucking billions of them!

294
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:57,249
- Where's Jacqui?
- We should have stopped!

295
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,541
- Bullshit!
- Anyway, we're all in for it now.

296
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:02,749
- Like fuck, Sonny!
- Hando, they're at the front door!

297
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:27,249
Come in. Come on.

298
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,208
You fucking filthy slope head scum.

299
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,291
You filthy yellow monkeys!

300
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,333
What the fuck are you afraid of?

301
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,749
This is our place.
No more running.

302
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:51,249
We stop them here!

303
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,958
You look like a bunch
of scared fucking rabbits.

304
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,041
Through the manhole,

305
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,249
across the roof.

306
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:17,708
All right, Davey?

307
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,499
Go!

308
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,541
- Fucking move it!
- Don't fucking rush me, you...

309
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,583
Bubs! Come on!

310
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,416
- Hando!
- Let's go!

311
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,416
Keep "stumm", keep your head down.
They don't know we're here yet.

312
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,416
Gabe! Where's your jacket?

313
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:14,750
Davey!

314
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:05,666
Cops. Cops. Let's go.

315
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,208
Fucking skinheads.

316
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,333
Fucking next time, mate.

317
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,208
Rob!

318
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:17,208
Come on! Rob, open the door!

319
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,791
Rob, open up!

320
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:28,624
Rob, is that you?

321
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:30,499
Prick wife-basher.

322
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:34,083
- What are you doing here?
- Can we talk to you for a while?

323
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,874
- How long is a while?
- I don't know.

324
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,541
- Where's Tracy?
- I'm here, Rob.

325
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:41,229
How come you stopped
making love to me?

326
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:44,583
That's it! Get lost!
That bitch smoked my fucking stash.

327
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,624
She's not coming back.

328
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:49,583
Rob, I know we haven't
known each other for long,

329
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,041
but we feel bad
about what happened

330
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:55,874
and we'd like to give you some money,
if only to pay for the food we ate.

331
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:57,708
You two have money? Pigs!

332
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,666
Rob, don't be a bastard.

333
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,499
- We want to make it up to you.
- Well, stick it in the hole.

334
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:07,666
If you want this money, then have
the decency to see us face to face.

335
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,249
Serves you right, you wanker.

336
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:26,249
- I'll get you, you maggots!
- Shut up!

337
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,874
Come on, guys. Let him go.

338
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,208
How's it going?

339
00:43:58,625 --> 00:43:59,666
Yeah!

340
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,374
"Yeah"?

341
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:04,291
Is that all you've got
to say for yourself?

342
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,624
Hello, Chris.

343
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:16,291
Hello, Chris!
Let's have a tonguey for the skins.

344
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:18,874
Come on!

345
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:27,041
- Tonguey for the skins.
- Couple of fucking faggots!

346
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,499
You faggots!

347
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,291
- Faggots!
- Sonny!

348
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:52,166
We're going to stay here for a while.
You don't want to hang around, do you?

349
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,333
Do you?

350
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:58,374
Now I'm going to
ask you nicely to leave.

351
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:01,833
If I see either one of you again,

352
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:09,374
I'm going to chop your legs off.

353
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,374
OK?

354
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:22,958
Stupid shit!

355
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:27,958
Hando? I'm starving, man.

356
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,458
Hippy degenerates.

357
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,499
Hot food!

358
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,833
Yeah.

359
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,333
- So, do you do much cooking?
- Sometimes.

360
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:08,749
My mum was a good cook.

361
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:12,958
And I liked Home Eco at school.

362
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:15,833
They had a great kitchen at Linley.

363
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,124
- Where?
- Linley Hall. It's my old school.

364
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:22,791
- Well, one of them.
- What is this shit?

365
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:27,833
Vegetables and pasta sauce.

366
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,666
Anything else?

367
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,458
Well, I used everything we had.

368
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:39,958
- Hey, Sonny...
- I can put different sauce on it, if you like.

369
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:42,416
Like the disposal unit?

370
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,708
Bloody wog crap!

371
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:08,666
Thanks for helping.

372
00:47:10,334 --> 00:47:12,666
Sometimes I live
like a slob, you know?

373
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,083
But when I make the effort...

374
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:24,999
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

375
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:41,499
All right.

376
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,791
It was an accident.

377
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,417
Gabe?

378
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,583
Gabe!

379
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,541
- What are you doing?
- Davey, do something!

380
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:21,499
What's wrong?

381
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:26,999
She's a spastic.

382
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:41,958
So what's the matter with you then?

383
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:53,208
Does it happen often?

384
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:55,666
Sometimes.

385
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:02,374
- I'm not crazy or anything.
- No one said you were.

386
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,124
I just get these fits sometimes.

387
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:15,583
There's stuff I can take for it.

388
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,291
Let's get a shotgun
and spray Harold's window.

389
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,124
Shotguns are for Elmer Fudd, dickhead.

390
00:49:27,584 --> 00:49:30,999
I vote we get a.45 automatic

391
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,083
and blow the head gook
back to Singapore.

392
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:36,208
Saigon, stupid.

393
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:41,833
I fired a.45 at a range once.
It was far out.

394
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,458
You never used a.45.
Don't shit me, Sonny.

395
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,416
What would you know, Baby Bubs?

396
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,833
An anti-static gun's big news for you.

397
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:51,857
We can get any sort of gun we want
from Bully at the Red Room.

398
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,458
All we need is the cash
and we need it up front.

399
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,958
- If you lot are going to shoot people...
- We're going.

400
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,124
Then go.

401
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:05,041
We don't want any fucking
passengers from here on in.

402
00:50:05,209 --> 00:50:06,999
So fuck off.

403
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:13,833
Sonny, do you
want to come with us?

404
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,458
No.

405
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:21,499
I want to kill gooks.
Gooks! Gooks!

406
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:27,249
- We could go fruit picking.
- I hate the fucking country. Don't I?

407
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:30,958
All right then.

408
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:44,124
- You'll all end up fucked!
- You'll end up fucked if you don't piss off!

409
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:48,708
You fucking moles!

410
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:55,499
I want guns.

411
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:59,541
Luke, Magoo, Champ, Brett...

412
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:04,374
I want revenge.

413
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,541
Bully handles cars.

414
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,708
Yeah, fuck cars.
Let's go do a burg.

415
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,458
You want to knock over
a house, do you?

416
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:19,874
What about it?

417
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,083
I know a place you could do.

418
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:25,416
It's better than anything
you got on your minds.

419
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:52,208
Is that you?

420
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,333
Hi.

421
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:03,374
Shut your mouth!

422
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,140
You're not going to
hit me again, are you?

423
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,666
How are your renovations going?

424
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,458
Bloody endless.

425
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,749
More Bundy and less coke.

426
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,833
See, I remembered.

427
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:05,999
Are you going to stay?

428
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:09,208
No, this is just a visit.

429
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,958
God.

430
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:25,499
I love you. Do you know that?

431
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,749
Sorry.

432
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:36,999
I'm going to the loo.

433
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:40,208
I'll be back in a sec.

434
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:47,249
- Nice place you have here.
- Who the hell are you?

435
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:51,624
We came to wreck everything
and ruin your life.

436
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:53,958
God sent us.

437
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:02,208
- Cheers, mate. Good on ya.
- To Martin, the big, fat, rich pig.

438
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,416
Fucking suck shit!

439
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:08,874
- Fuck, mate!
- You mug!

440
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,416
- Thanks, Martin.
- Shit!

441
00:55:18,709 --> 00:55:20,291
Fuck, mate.

442
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:25,208
- What's in it?
- Wack it in there, mate.

443
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,374
That's shit, isn't it?

444
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:49,749
Could be worth something.
The guns will be worth a lot.

445
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:52,208
Hey, Gabe.

446
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:57,958
Bubs!

447
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,624
Hey, Hando, I found one
without the barrel filled in.

448
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:13,458
It doesn't work, though.

449
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,583
None of them work, Bubs.

450
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,833
The firing pin's been ground down.

451
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,958
Still looks good, though.

452
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:33,249
What does this bastard do anyway?

453
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:37,249
He used to be in advertising,
but he made films.

454
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:40,333
He did "Mortal Blade"
and "Last Blood".

455
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,958
They came out last year.
Did you see them?

456
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:47,291
So, how do you know him?

457
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:48,791
He's my dad.

458
00:56:50,459 --> 00:56:53,499
He won an award for this poster.
It's good, isn't it?

459
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:55,083
Did you see it?

460
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,458
He's very talented, you know.

461
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:16,208
Go on then. You fucking shit.

462
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,249
Hurry up, come on. Let's get it
fucking loaded so we can piss off.

463
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:27,249
What a fucking tragedy
breaking this up for parts.

464
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,624
Cackles!
Just be fucking careful, all right?

465
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:37,458
Martin really loved this car.

466
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:42,604
Blotted his copy book with
that piece of shit though, didn't he?

467
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,791
Jap crap.

468
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:06,874
Fuck you!

469
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,249
Why are you doing this to me?

470
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:38,541
I want to see you squirm.

471
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,416
Incredible little bitch.

472
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,833
- I loved you.
- That wasn't love.

473
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:48,958
Let me go, Gabrielle.

474
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:05,333
Why didn't you love Mum?

475
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,166
Did she know about us?

476
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:11,499
Did she?

477
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,291
Sometimes...
I think she killed herself.

478
00:59:22,584 --> 00:59:24,499
She died in an accident.

479
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:27,999
An accident,
that's all there was to it.

480
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,374
I loved her.

481
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,708
And I loved you.

482
00:59:37,209 --> 00:59:38,416
Shut up!

483
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,666
And you wanted me.

484
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,791
Next time I'll aim at your skull.

485
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,666
Check this out.

486
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:38,374
"Timmy and Ted went to bed
dressed in red dressing gowns."

487
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:44,791
- Who's Timmy and Ted?
- My cats.

488
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:50,499
I used to always do this.

489
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:02,874
That's my brother Nicholas.

490
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,416
He's gay now.

491
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,416
Cute though.

492
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:16,708
You're cute too.

493
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,624
Give me a look.

494
01:01:47,709 --> 01:01:49,249
It looks all right.

495
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,666
See, Hando doesn't act
like he likes me.

496
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:04,999
- He likes you though, doesn't he?
- He's my best mate.

497
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:18,291
I want him to go away
on a holiday with me.

498
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:21,249
Just him and me.

499
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:24,583
And you.

500
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,583
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

501
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,458
You like me, don't you?

502
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:49,124
Don't you?

503
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:00,124
I'll kill you, boy!

504
01:04:04,084 --> 01:04:05,291
It's locked!

505
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:15,124
Hando, he's got a gun!

506
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:23,791
Get fucking in!

507
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:43,833
Gabrielle!

508
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,833
Stop doing that to your hair.
You look fucking pathetic.

509
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,791
And while you're at it,
keep the fucking noise down as well.

510
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:27,333
I told you to shut up!

511
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:31,624
- What's wrong with you?
- You, you dumb slut. Shut up!

512
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:35,999
Don't go crazy at me just because
you and your mates fucked up.

513
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:41,958
You had it all on a plate. But no,
you had to play silly buggers with the car.

514
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:44,499
Why couldn't you
just take his stuff and go?

515
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,791
You're a loser.

516
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,833
Don't call me that.
No one ever calls me that!

517
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:02,958
I was going to give her to you anyway.
I want you to go.

518
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:06,041
I'm sick of looking at you.

519
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:16,374
Go! We're finished. You're out.

520
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,833
- Just like that?
- Yes.

521
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,083
All right then.

522
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,083
All right.

523
01:06:25,709 --> 01:06:26,874
You...

524
01:06:28,334 --> 01:06:30,666
- You'll all end up...
- Shut up!

525
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,624
You live like shit!

526
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:39,083
You can't even
look after yourselves!

527
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,874
You're just hopeless!

528
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:47,416
Where the fuck are you going?

529
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:49,958
I'm going home.

530
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,666
Well, good riddance to you, boy!

531
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:56,124
Maybe you'll get that fuck
you've been after for so long.

532
01:07:00,209 --> 01:07:01,166
Davey!

533
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:05,291
What are you leaving us for?
You're leaving us for her?

534
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:07,958
You're a suck! You're weak!

535
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:10,749
You're piss weak and gutless!

536
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,583
Fuck off, little Bubs.

537
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:16,958
I thought you were strong.
You're weak!

538
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:18,874
You're nothing!

539
01:07:24,209 --> 01:07:25,166
Gabe?

540
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:29,416
- Leave me alone!
- Gabe!

541
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:31,708
Look...

542
01:07:33,334 --> 01:07:36,583
- There's something I've got to do.
- Well, can I come?

543
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,583
No.

544
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:42,583
Have you got a piece of paper?

545
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:44,499
No.

546
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,499
Bubs.

547
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:03,874
If ever you need me or want me,
I'll be at this address.

548
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:21,541
Is that Footscray Police?

549
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:23,499
Listen,

550
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:27,416
I know where there's some people
that you might be looking for.

551
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:03,166
- Shut up, cockhead!
- Christ!

552
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:12,791
Got cut off yesterday.

553
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,249
- Anyone know we're here?
- No. No way.

554
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,999
Is there a tap outside?

555
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:38,499
I don't know.

556
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:43,166
I thought you were
supposed to be my scout?

557
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:42,083
Drop it! Drop it!

558
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:47,708
- Hurry!
- Right!

559
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,124
No!

560
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,893
Come on, copper!
You murdering fucking...

561
01:10:57,334 --> 01:10:58,958
You fucking...

562
01:11:00,042 --> 01:11:03,791
Fuck off, pig!
Fuck off, you fucking pigs!

563
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:07,083
Lezz-slut!

564
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:11,791
Fuck you!
I'll fucking kill you!

565
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,124
- I surrender.
- Too fucking late.

566
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,583
That's right, you know the rules.

567
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,749
They're smiling at you.

568
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,583
You have a lovely smile too.

569
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,374
Thank you.

570
01:12:11,084 --> 01:12:11,584
David!

571
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:19,958
Someone here to see you.
She looks like a tramp.

572
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:22,166
Don't worry, Grandma.

573
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:23,291
Hi, Gabe.

574
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:26,791
Why don't you bring your friends into
the house and entertain them in there?

575
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,708
We're OK out here, Gran.

576
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:35,833
You don't look right without
your jacket with all the badges.

577
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:39,166
Well, my Grandma, you know,
she doesn't know about that.

578
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,958
She doesn't like the badges or anything.
I don't want to upset her.

579
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,249
It's her place.

580
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:01,874
What's this?

581
01:13:04,209 --> 01:13:06,041
That's my matchbox collection.

582
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:08,583
My dad...

583
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,958
he's an industrial diver.
He travels all around the world. See?

584
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:18,791
Amsterdam,

585
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,249
San Francisco,

586
01:13:21,334 --> 01:13:22,458
Venice,

587
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:24,874
Perth,

588
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:26,708
Naples.

589
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:34,833
I think he's in Sydney
working on the Sydney Harbour tunnel.

590
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:40,791
I haven't got a box from there?

591
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,291
I love you.

592
01:15:27,209 --> 01:15:28,666
I love you too.

593
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,666
Don't ever leave me.

594
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:57,708
Hando!

595
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:04,458
- They killed Bubs.
- What?

596
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:09,624
The cops come.

597
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:12,041
They took everybody else.

598
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,791
They killed Bubs.

599
01:16:18,209 --> 01:16:20,833
How did they know
where to get us?

600
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:30,083
She's been with me
since she left the squat.

601
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:33,083
She hasn't told anyone.

602
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:36,291
Shit!

603
01:16:43,917 --> 01:16:46,999
What is wrong?
Why are my "Lieblings" barking so?

604
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:48,541
- It's just a cat.
- What?

605
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,416
A cat. They've seen a cat.

606
01:16:50,584 --> 01:16:52,791
We don't get many cats in this yard.

607
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,833
Is that girl still here?
I'm not running a brothel.

608
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,499
I'm alone, Gran.

609
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:02,083
You can't come in.
I'm not dressed.

610
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:09,666
They'll find you here.

611
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,708
They'll come looking for you.
You know that.

612
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:15,124
Yeah.

613
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,458
I think we should stick together.
Past is past, right?

614
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:38,666
We're all we've got left, Davey.

615
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:46,666
What do you want to do?

616
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,749
I've got a plan, mate.

617
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:55,458
Let go of him!

618
01:17:57,792 --> 01:17:59,124
You'll kill him!

619
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:01,166
Stop it! You don't have to...

620
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:11,291
- No! He's fucking killed him!
- Shut up!

621
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:15,999
- No! He's fucking killed... No!
- We're never going to get out of this.

622
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:19,458
- Is he dead?
- Is the car full?

623
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:20,999
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

624
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:23,166
- Is the car full?
- Yes.

625
01:18:23,334 --> 01:18:25,583
The jerry? The fucking jerry?

626
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,708
Yes!

627
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,749
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Why'd you fucking kill him?

628
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:37,357
We'll drive all night and dump
this piece of shit in Adelaide.

629
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:48,958
I haven't been to the beach in years.

630
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,208
- Be all right if we stay here a while?
- Not long.

631
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,874
I think we should go west.

632
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:34,333
I'll get you through this,
I promise.

633
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:41,041
Davey!

634
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:48,416
We just have to stick together.

635
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,249
I'm not afraid.

636
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:58,708
She's sick, mate.

637
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,333
She's trouble.

638
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:08,291
She doesn't really want you.
She'll just use you.

639
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,416
You won't get
nowhere with her, Davey.

640
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:22,541
- She needs medicine or something.
- She's my problem, isn't she?

641
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:24,791
- Listen to me.
- Take your hands off me!

642
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,666
- I'm sick of listening to you, all right?
- She's desperate.

643
01:22:30,834 --> 01:22:32,791
She'll drag you down, Davey.

644
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:45,583
She doesn't love you,
if that's what you think.

645
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:47,666
Is that what you think?

646
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:51,708
She's fucking desperate, that's all.

647
01:22:54,792 --> 01:22:57,374
Davey, she's going to
drag us both down.

648
01:23:02,459 --> 01:23:03,583
Besides which,

649
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,791
you don't want her involved if...

650
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:11,499
we get caught,
for last night, do you?

651
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,374
We've got to get rid of her.

652
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:25,874
She can have a share of the money.
Can't be fairer than that.

653
01:23:28,084 --> 01:23:29,541
Do you want to tell her?

654
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,999
I'll tell her, if you want.

655
01:23:35,709 --> 01:23:37,583
You're not just dumping her.

656
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:41,833
We'll give her fucking
two hundred bucks. All right?

657
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,541
You've looked after her
as far as you can.

658
01:23:57,125 --> 01:24:04,833
Are you going to tell her?

659
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,958
I'm with her,

660
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:10,791
and she's with me.

661
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,958
Well, Davey, I tried.

662
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,333
What's that?

663
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:01,833
It's where the fucking car is!

664
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:13,833
- What happened?
- Gabe!

665
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,249
What happened,
you mental bitch?

666
01:25:15,417 --> 01:25:18,874
Mental bitch!
I heard what you two said.

667
01:25:19,542 --> 01:25:21,333
I know what you're going to do.

668
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,541
You suck, Davey.
You can't do anything without him.

669
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,999
- It was me who called the cops.
- What?

670
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:30,541
I called them.

671
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:33,291
No!

672
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,124
Hando!

673
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,708
Davey!

674
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:33,791
I told you, you stupid cunt!
I fucking told you!

675
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,999
You bitch! You're fucking dead!

676
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:51,708
Gabe!

677
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,999
Are they all right?

678
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:04,041
I'm not sure.

679
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:10,833
Stay.

680
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,057
