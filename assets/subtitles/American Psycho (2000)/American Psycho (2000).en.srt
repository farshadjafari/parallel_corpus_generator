1
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:12,757
rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis
with a sorrel timbale.

2
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,093
...and grilled
free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

3
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,014
Our pasta tonight is
a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.

4
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,731
God, I hate this place.
It's a chick's restaurant.
Why aren't we at Dorsia?

5
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,816
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.

6
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,905
Is that Reed Robinson
over there?

7
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,991
- Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.
- Well, who is it then?

8
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,994
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

9
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,455
Paul Allen's
on the other side
of the room over there.

10
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,499
Who's he with?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

11
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,459
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

12
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,420
Are you sure
that's Paul Allen over there?
Yes, McDufus, I am.

13
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,048
- He's handling
the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.

14
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:58,553
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does
that have to do with anything?

15
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,555
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...

16
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:02,723
talking on the phone
to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

17
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,309
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

18
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,270
Oh, my God, Bateman.

19
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:10,356
Do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes?
Some latkes?

20
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,110
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

21
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,322
Oh, I forgot.
Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.

22
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,284
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

23
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,871
Speaking of reasonable...
Only $570.

24
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,915
That's not bad.

25
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,042
A little something
for the purse.

26
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,044
Give her the 50.

27
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,002
Stoli on the rocks.

28
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,464
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.

29
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,799
That'll be $25.

30
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,013
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

31
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,682
I wanna stab you to death...

32
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,352
and play around
with your blood.

33
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,198
What can I get
for you two?

34
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,100
I live in the
American Gardens building...

35
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,686
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.

36
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,897
My name is Patrick Bateman.

37
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,899
I'm 27 years old.

38
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,236
I believe in
taking care of myself,

39
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:25,241
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.

40
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,743
In the morning,
if my face is a little puffy,

41
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,913
I'll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches.

42
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,915
I can do a thousand now.

43
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,437
After I remove the ice pack,
I use a deep pore
cleanser lotion.

44
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,773
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.

45
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,445
Then
a honey-almond body scrub.

46
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,240
And on the face,
an exfoliating gel scrub.

47
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,294
Then I apply
an herb mint facial masque,

48
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,423
which I leave on for ten minutes
while I prepare the rest
of my routine.

49
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,971
I always use
an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,

50
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,850
because alcohol
dries your face out
and makes you look older.

51
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,852
Then moisturizer,

52
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,938
then an anti-aging eye balm,

53
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,483
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

54
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,154
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.

55
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:49,367
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.

56
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,328
Only an entity...
something illusory.

57
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,997
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...

58
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,251
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh
gripping yours...

59
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:03,130
and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles
are probably comparable,

60
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,509
I simply am not there.

61
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,409
Good morning.

62
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,704
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.

63
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,379
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry.
Any messages?

64
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,966
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what
he was cancelling or why.

65
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,553
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club.
Anyone else?

66
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,806
Spencer wants to meet
for drinks at Fluties, Pier 17.
When?

67
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,976
After 6:00.
And what should I say?
Negative. Cancel it.

68
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,897
Just say "no."
Just say "no"?

69
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,690
Okay, Jean.

70
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,318
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,

71
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,278
and if not there
try Crayons.

72
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,906
All right?
Yes, sir.

73
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:15,328
Oh, wait. And I need
reservations for two at Arcadia
at 8:00 on Thursday.

74
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,288
Something romantic?

75
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,500
No.

76
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,086
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.

77
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,088
No, I'll do it.
No, no.

78
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:30,384
Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?
You look nice today.

79
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,054
Don't wear that outfit again.

80
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,097
What? I didn't hear you.

81
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,767
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.

82
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,853
Wear a dress, a skirt
or something.
You don't like this, I take it.

83
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,190
Come on.
You're prettier than that.

84
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,652
- Thanks, Patrick.
-
- I'm not here.

85
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,490
And high heels.
I like high heels.

86
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,332
Feathered friends for 600.

87
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,709
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...

88
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,254
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

89
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,479
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.

90
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,857
And lots of
chocolate truffles,

91
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,401
Godiva, and oysters
in the half shell.

92
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,362
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

93
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,867
but Evelyn,
my supposed fianc?,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

94
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,328
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

95
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,747
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

96
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,042
Patrick,
we should do it.

97
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,504
Do what?
Get married.
Have a wedding.

98
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,798
No. I can't take
the time off work.

99
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,342
Your father practically owns
the company. You can do
anything you like, silly.

100
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,053
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.

101
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,097
I don't see why
you just don't quit.

102
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,727
Because I want to fit in.

103
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,907
Williams party.

104
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,993
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

105
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,079
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

106
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,626
But we do,
and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

107
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,880
Patrick,
this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.

108
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,341
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.

109
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,969
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.

110
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,223
Okay. All right.

111
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,391
I'm fairly certain that...

112
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,853
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.

113
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,773
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

114
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,318
I'm almost
completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

115
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:57,406
I'm having an affair
with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.

116
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,450
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.

117
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,120
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

118
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,581
Tonight, I believe,
it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.

119
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,793
More disturbing than her
drug use, though, is the fact
that she's engaged...

120
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,463
to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest doofus
in the business.

121
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,841
Tell me, Stash.

122
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,469
Do you think Soho
is becoming too...
commercial?

123
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,848
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

124
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,933
Hey, that affects us.

125
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,937
Well, what about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?
Doesn't that affect us too?

126
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,939
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka?

127
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,108
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there?

128
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,235
Come on, Bryce.

129
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,613
There are a lot more
important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

130
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,200
- Like what?
- Well, we have to
end apartheid, for one,

131
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:46,664
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.

132
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,501
We have to provide
food and shelter
for the homeless...

133
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,797
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,

134
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,758
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

135
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,178
We have to encourage
a return...

136
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,889
to traditional moral values.

137
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,391
Most importantly,

138
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,687
we have to promote
general social concern...

139
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,691
and less materialism
in young people.

140
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,486
Patrick,
how thought provoking.

141
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,858
Hello.

142
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,654
Hello.

143
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,383
Bleaching? Are you
trying to say "bleaching"?

144
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,426
Oh, my God.
Two things.

145
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,428
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

146
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,390
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

147
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,475
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.

148
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,145
Lady, if you don't shut
your fucking mouth,
I will kill you.

149
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,772
Now, listen.

150
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,400
I have a lunch meeting
at Hubert's in 20 minutes
with Ronald Harrison.

151
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,318
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

152
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,738
Listen, I can't understand you!
This is crazy!
You're a fool.

153
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,824
I can't cope with this
stupid "bitchee"!

154
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,451
Understand?
Christ.
Patrick?

155
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,871
Hi, Patrick.

156
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,124
I thought that was you.
Hello.
This is...

157
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,586
Isn't it ridiculous,
coming all the way up here?
They really are the best.

158
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,629
Then why can't they
get these stains out?

159
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,133
I mean, can you talk
to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.

160
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,178
- Oh, what are those?
- Well, it's...

161
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,431
- Cranberry juice.
Cranapple.
- Really?

162
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,267
Listen, if you
could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

163
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,437
I'm really late.
I have a lunch appointment
at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

164
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,814
Hubert's?
That moved uptown, right?
Oh, boy.

165
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,192
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

166
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,194
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

167
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,822
I'm downtown quite often.
What about a Saturday?
I'm at work all the time.

168
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,576
Next Saturday?
Can't, I'm afraid.
Sure.

169
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,745
At a matinee of Les Mis.
Listen, I really gotta go.

170
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,207
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you.
Okay. Do.

171
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,709
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.

172
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,711
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

173
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,630
What could you possibly
be up to tonight?

174
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,549
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?

175
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,928
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

176
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,640
Pumpkin? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.

177
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,477
Mm-hmm.
Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.

178
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,648
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

179
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,859
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay?

180
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,363
I have to go.
Courtney?

181
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,365
Hmm?
Dinner.

182
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,992
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.

183
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,414
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.

184
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,458
Oh, yeah!

185
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,762
Dorsia.

186
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,014
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,

187
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:36,727
but is it possible
to reserve a table for two
at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?

188
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,373
...a facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.

189
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,626
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,

190
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,005
where I got this little...

191
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,550
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?

192
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,594
God, Patrick.
Shut up.

193
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,430
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium
or have a Diet Coke.

194
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,391
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

195
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,227
I just want a child.

196
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,897
Just two...

197
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,524
perfect...

198
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,943
children.

199
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,700
Are we here?
Yeah.

200
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,586
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.

201
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,380
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...

202
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,050
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.

203
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,012
New York Matinee called it
"a playful but
mysterious little dish."

204
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,933
You'll love it.
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

205
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,935
I think that'll
follow nicely.

206
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,813
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.

207
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,864
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

208
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,825
Dorsia.
How impressive.

209
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,078
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there?

210
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,455
Lucky, I guess.

211
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,457
That's a wonderful suit.

212
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,876
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

213
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,921
Mmm, Valentino Couture?

214
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,090
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

215
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,301
It looks so soft.
Your compliment
was sufficient, Luis.

216
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,183
Hello, Halberstram.
Nice tie.
How the hell are you?

217
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,478
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

218
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,189
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,

219
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,733
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.

220
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,821
He also has a penchant
for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

221
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,823
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,

222
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,117
although I have
a slightly better haircut.

223
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,537
- How's the Ransom account
going, Marcus?
- It's, uh, all right.

224
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,956
Really? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.

225
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,709
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia?

226
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,503
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

227
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,673
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations
on the Fisher account.

228
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,426
- Thank you, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.

229
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,517
Call me.
How about Friday?

230
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:26,022
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

231
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,609
Great sea urchin ceviche.

232
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,694
Dorsia on Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

233
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,696
I think he's lying.

234
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,535
- Is that a gram?
- New card.

235
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,538
What do you think?

236
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,166
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.

237
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,170
Look at that.
Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

238
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,172
Good coloring.
That's bone.

239
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,799
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

240
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,428
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing.
Look at this.

241
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,805
That is really nice.

242
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,851
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think?

243
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,771
Nice.

244
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:11,400
Jesus. That is really super.
How'd a nitwit like you
get so tasteful?

245
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,945
I can't believe that Bryce...

246
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,948
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

247
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,909
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

248
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:27,250
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.

249
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,919
Impressive.
Very nice.

250
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,046
Hmm.

251
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,340
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

252
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,773
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.

253
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,776
The tasteful thickness of it.

254
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,029
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.

255
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,328
Is something wrong,
Patrick?

256
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,330
You're sweating.

257
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,486
Hello. Pat Bateman.

258
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,488
You want some, uh, money?

259
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,490
Some food?

260
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,329
- Is this what you need?
- I'm-I'm hungry.

261
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,331
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it?

262
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,506
Why don't you get a job?
If you're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?

263
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,508
I lost my job.

264
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,635
Why? You drinking?

265
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,347
Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading?

266
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,641
Just joking.

267
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,852
Listen, what's your name?
Al.

268
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,896
Hmm? Speak up.
Come on.
Al.

269
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,232
Get a goddamn job, Al.

270
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,443
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

271
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,072
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.

272
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,951
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind...
You're a kind man.

273
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,953
It's okay.
I can tell.

274
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,373
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do.
You gotta help me.

275
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,376
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.

276
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,045
You know how bad you smell?

277
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,215
You reek of shit.
Do you know that?

278
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,593
Al.

279
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,638
I'm sorry.
It's just that...

280
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,682
I don't know.

281
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,352
I don't have anything
in common with you.

282
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,238
Oh.
Oh, thank you, mister.
Thank you.

283
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,449
I'm cold out here.

284
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,451
You know what
a fucking loser you are?
What?

285
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,813
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

286
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,066
So fine,
so smooth.

287
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,076
I have all the characteristics
of a human being...

288
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,747
flesh, blood, skin, hair...

289
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,125
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,

290
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,629
except for greed and disgust.

291
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,340
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

292
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,342
and I don't know why.

293
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,597
My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.

294
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,351
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

295
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,646
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

296
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,994
Hey, McCloy,
what do you say?

297
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,539
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

298
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,835
Is Allen still handling
the Fisher account?
Of course. Who else?

299
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,879
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.

300
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,465
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.

301
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,801
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are.
I'm not late.

302
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,012
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

303
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:54,141
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says,
"Merry Christmas, Patrick."

304
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,687
What is it?
It's a little baby
piggly-wiggly, isn't it?

305
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,189
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.

306
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,650
They make darling pets.
Don't you?

307
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,027
Don't you?

308
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,155
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.

309
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,449
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas?

310
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,785
And don't say
breast implants again.

311
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,374
Allen.
Marcus.
Merry Christmas.

312
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,544
How you been?
Workaholic, I suppose?
Haven't seen you in a while.

313
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:25,673
Hey, Hamilton.
We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

314
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,051
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring...

315
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,054
Cecilla?
Yes, Cecilla.

316
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,390
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

317
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,143
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.

318
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,103
Great party.
Thanks.

319
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,397
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus?

320
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,108
Mistletoe alert.

321
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,952
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.

322
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,708
No, I want to know, okay?
I came here for
the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

323
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,378
which is, after all,
the only excuse one could have
for being in this restaurant,

324
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,881
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

325
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,468
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight,
and a Corona.

326
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,262
Would you like to hear...
Double Absolut martini.

327
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,389
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear
the specials?

328
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,892
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.

329
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:24,982
This is a real beehive
of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.

330
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,903
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup
and charcoal arugula...

331
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,947
are outrageous here.

332
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,324
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce.

333
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,952
Give me a break.

334
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,249
I see they've omitted
the pork loin with lime Jell-O.
We should've gone to Dorsia.

335
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,001
I could've gotten us
a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.

336
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,756
Is that Ivana Trump?

337
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:52,718
Oh, geez, Patrick.
I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking?

338
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:56,597
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana?

339
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,685
So, uh,
wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account?

340
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:05,273
How'd you get it?
Well, I could
tell you that, Halberstram,

341
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,692
but then I'd have to
kill you.

342
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:18,327
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know
I'm utterly insane?

343
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,624
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.

344
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,501
Where do you tan?
Salon.

345
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,837
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

346
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,215
And, uh, Cecilla.

347
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,551
How is she?
Where is she tonight?

348
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,512
Cecilla's, uh...
Well, you know Cecilla.

349
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,223
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.

350
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,185
Evelyn?
Great ass.

351
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,938
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman.
What a dork.

352
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,192
Another martini, Paul?

353
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,866
You like
Huey Lewis and the News?

354
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,118
Um, they're okay.

355
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,916
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.

356
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,960
But when Sports
came out in '83,

357
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,088
I think they really
came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

358
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,011
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,

359
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,805
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...

360
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,100
that really gives the songs
a big boost.

361
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,820
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,

362
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:39,534
but I think Huey has
a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

363
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,494
Hey, Halberstram?
Yes, Allen?

364
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,413
Why are there copies
of the Style section
all over the place?

365
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:49,377
Do you...
Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?

366
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:52,338
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat?

367
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,674
Yes, it is.

368
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,343
In '87, Huey released this...

369
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,345
Fore, their most
accomplished album.

370
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:03,099
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is
"Hip To Be Square."

371
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,935
The song's so catchy,
most people probably
don't listen to the lyrics.

372
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,479
But they should,
because it's not just about...

373
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,440
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.

374
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:15,736
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself.
Hey, Paul!

375
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,287
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,

376
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,498
you fuckin' stupid bastard!

377
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:31,460
You fucking bastard!

378
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:34,357
He was completely naked
and standing up
on the table.

379
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,943
He had no clothes on
whatsoever, and he...

380
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,945
Patrick?
Patrick.

381
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,614
Is that you?

382
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,951
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.

383
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,119
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

384
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:51,374
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

385
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,210
Ooh.

386
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,630
Where did you get
that overnight bag?

387
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,176
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

388
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,356
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,

389
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:17,400
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...

390
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,485
before disposing
of the body.

391
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,697
There is a moment
of sheer panic...

392
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:27,160
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...

393
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,871
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.

394
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,877
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,

395
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,046
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

396
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,966
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.

397
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,096
Where do I send the bastard?

398
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,098
Dallas?

399
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,726
Paris? Singapore?

400
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,979
London? I'll send
the asshole to London.

401
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:03,446
Hi. This is Paul.

402
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,573
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

403
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,951
Meredith, I'll call you
when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

404
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,479
What is it?

405
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:40,149
Patrick.
Yes, Jean?

406
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:43,444
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you.
Who?

407
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:46,113
Detective Donald Kimball.

408
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,244
Tell him I'm at lunch.

409
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,790
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

410
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,209
Send him in, I guess.

411
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,053
Now, John,
you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

412
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,974
There are definite
do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

413
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,476
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...

414
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,937
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.

415
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,482
Yes, always tip the stylist
15 percent.

416
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,319
Listen, John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

417
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:30,116
Just joking.
No, don't tip the owner
of the salon.

418
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,118
Okay, John? Right.

419
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:35,371
Got it.
Sorry about that.

420
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,999
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

421
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,001
Was that anything important?

422
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:43,087
Oh, that?
Just mulling over
business problems,

423
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:47,550
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.

424
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:50,845
Hi.

425
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,890
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.

426
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,225
Nice to meet you.
Sorry to barge in on you
like this.

427
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,311
I know how busy
you guys can get.

428
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:05,067
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion?

429
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,612
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...

430
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,781
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

431
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,036
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

432
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:17,205
So it's nothing
that official.

433
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,458
- I just have some questions
about Paul Allen and yourself.
- Coffee?

434
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,668
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris?

435
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:24,712
No, I'm okay.

436
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,340
Can you bring Mr...

437
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,092
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball
a bottle of Apollinaris.

438
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,303
It's no problem.

439
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,099
So, what's the topic
of discussion?

440
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,810
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.

441
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,523
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't...

442
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:48,236
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.

443
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,446
Not on page six, at least.

444
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:54,200
- I think his family
wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime?

445
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:58,329
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure? I can always
get you a lime.

446
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:01,457
Just some preliminary
questions that I need
for my own files, okay?

447
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,459
Shoot.

448
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:06,045
Hold old are you?
Twenty-seven.

449
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,047
Where did you go
to school?
Harvard.

450
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,758
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address?

451
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:13,052
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

452
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,681
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

453
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:20,434
What can you tell me
about Paul Allen?
I'm at a loss.

454
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,354
He was part of that whole
Yale thing.
"Yale thing"?

455
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:26,274
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean,
"Yale thing"?

456
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:30,319
Well, I think for one
that he was probably
a closet homosexual...

457
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,321
who did a lot of cocaine.

458
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,532
That "Yale thing."

459
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:38,703
What kind of man was he,
besides the information
you've just given?

460
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,622
- I hope I'm not being
cross-examined here.
- You feel like that?

461
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,749
No, not really.

462
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,753
Where did Paul hang out?

463
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,755
Hang out?
Yeah, you know, hang out.

464
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:54,010
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,

465
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,970
Fluties, Indochine,

466
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,014
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

467
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:00,474
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht?

468
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:04,478
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he
go to school?

469
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,064
Don't you know this?

470
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,150
I just wanted to know
if you know.

471
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:16,324
Before Yale,
if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.

472
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:19,368
Listen, I just...
I just wanna help.

473
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,455
I understand.

474
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,876
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints?

475
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:31,047
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine
that says he went to London.

476
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,716
- Well, maybe he did, huh?
- His girlfriend
doesn't think so.

477
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,843
- But has anyone seen him
in London?
- Actually, yes.

478
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,180
Hmm.
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.

479
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:43,100
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

480
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,102
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...

481
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,522
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so...

482
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:50,900
- Had his apartment
been burglarized?
- No, actually, it hadn't.

483
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:54,487
Toiletries were missing,
a suit was gone, so was
some luggage. That's it.

484
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,989
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet
or anything, right?

485
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,534
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.

486
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,911
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.

487
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,831
So typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.

488
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,458
One day,
someone's walking around,

489
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,044
going to work, alive,
and then...

490
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,547
Nothing.

491
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,549
People just disappear.

492
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:18,302
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.

493
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:22,682
Eerie.
Really eerie.

494
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,523
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.

495
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,819
I have a lunch meeting
with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

496
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,781
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

497
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,326
I mean, aren't you
gonna be late?
No, there's one down here.

498
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,829
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.

499
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:49,083
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you,
any information...

500
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,836
Absolutely.
I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.

501
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:55,548
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

502
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,429
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

503
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,158
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.

504
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:08,621
- Would you like to see
my apartment?
- I'm not supposed to.

505
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,250
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not?

506
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:18,840
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

507
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,510
Do you take a credit card?

508
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:25,137
I'm joking.

509
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,223
Come on. Get in.

510
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,819
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.

511
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:43,281
Blonde,
who does couples.
Couples.

512
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:47,743
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.

513
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,456
I'm Paul.

514
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:55,751
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that?

515
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:59,839
You're Christie.
You're to respond
only to Christie.

516
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,841
Is that clear?

517
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,895
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

518
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,731
I want you
to clean your vagina.

519
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,910
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.

520
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:31,829
You have a very nice body.

521
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,425
Mm-hmm?

522
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,178
Thank you. Send her up.

523
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:53,017
Christie,
get out and dry off.

524
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,895
Choose a robe...
not the Bijan...

525
00:39:56,103 --> 00:40:00,525
and come and meet
me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.

526
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,450
You've arrived.
How lovely.

527
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,452
Let me take your coat.

528
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,288
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

529
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,003
Not quite blonde,
are you?

530
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,005
More dirty blonde.

531
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,591
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.

532
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:27,718
I'm Paul Allen.

533
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:49,031
So.

534
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:51,033
Don't you wanna know
what I do?

535
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,040
No.
No, not really.

536
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,712
Well, I work on Wall Street...

537
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,089
for Pierce & Pierce.

538
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,258
Have you heard of it?

539
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:19,187
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.

540
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:21,230
How much
did you pay for it?

541
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,357
Well, actually,

542
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:26,235
that's none of your business,
Christie.

543
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:30,072
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

544
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:32,408
No. No smoking.
Not in here.

545
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,996
Varda truffle?

546
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,709
I don't want you to get drunk,

547
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:45,171
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.

548
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:55,264
Do you like Phil Collins?

549
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:57,558
I've been a big Genesis fan
ever since the release...

550
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:01,646
of their 1980 album Duke.

551
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:06,442
Before that,
I really didn't understand
any of their work.

552
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,529
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.

553
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:12,323
It was on Duke where...

554
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:15,368
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

555
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:23,000
I think Invisible Touch
is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.

556
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:29,465
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.

557
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,263
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

558
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,641
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.

559
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,727
Christie,
take off the robe.

560
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,815
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...

561
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:48,568
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.

562
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:52,989
You can practically hear
every nuance
of every instrument.

563
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:55,032
Sabrina, remove your dress.

564
00:42:56,826 --> 00:43:00,163
In terms of
lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

565
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:03,332
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

566
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,793
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.

567
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:09,839
Take the lyrics to
"Land of Confusion."

568
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:12,008
In this song,
Phil Collins...

569
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:16,095
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.

570
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,934
"In Too Deep"
is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

571
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:25,354
about monogamy and commitment.

572
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:28,691
The song is
extremely uplifting.

573
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:32,153
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

574
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:36,532
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.

575
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:42,121
Christie,
get down on your knees...

576
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:45,249
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

577
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:48,002
Phil Collins' solo career...

578
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,880
seems to be more commercial,

579
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,133
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,

580
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:58,763
especially songs like
"In the Air Tonight"
and "Against All Odds."

581
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,683
Sabrina,
don't just stare at it.
Eat it.

582
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:07,772
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...

583
00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:11,776
within the confines
of the group
than as a solo artist.

584
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:15,279
And I stress the word "artist."

585
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,202
This is "Sussudio."

586
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:24,247
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.

587
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:40,763
Look at the camera.

588
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:18,801
Christie, look at the camera.

589
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,027
Don't touch the watch.

590
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:00,092
Can we go now?

591
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:02,053
We're not through yet.

592
00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:23,533
If they have a good personality
and they're not great looking,
then who fucking cares?

593
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,535
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay?

594
00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:27,870
What if they have
a good personality?

595
00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:31,040
I know.
I know.

596
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:33,709
There are no girls
with good personalities.

597
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:36,629
A good personality consists
of a chick with
a little hard body...

598
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:38,548
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...

599
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,550
without being too slutty
about things...

600
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:42,552
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

601
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,595
The only girls
with good personalities...

602
00:46:44,762 --> 00:46:47,890
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent
or talented...

603
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:50,893
though God knows
what the fuck that means...
are ugly chicks.

604
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,229
Absolutely.
And this is because
they have to make up...

605
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:55,106
for how fucking
unattractive they are.

606
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:58,401
- Do you know what Ed Gein
said about women?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

607
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:02,405
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin,
in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say?

608
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:05,616
"When I see a pretty girl
walking down the street,
I think two things.

609
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:08,077
"One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,

610
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:10,621
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

611
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,124
- And what did the other part
of him think?

612
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,793
What her head would look like
on a stick.

613
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:23,926
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion
on something.

614
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:27,722
It's my business card.

615
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:31,142
I decided to get
a new one too.

616
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,645
Oh, it's...

617
00:47:34,812 --> 00:47:36,647
Very nice, Luis.

618
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:40,067
Thank you.

619
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:56,042
Listen, what about dinner?

620
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:58,961
Is that all you ever have
to contribute, Van Patten?
"What about fucking dinner"?

621
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:02,048
Cheer up there, Bateman.
What's the matter?
No shiatsu this morning?

622
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:05,384
Keep touching me like that,
you'll draw back a stump.
Hold on there, little buddy.

623
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:07,386
Excuse me.

624
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:47,718
God. Patrick.
Why here?

625
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:50,388
I've seen you
looking at me.

626
00:48:50,555 --> 00:48:53,683
I've noticed your...

627
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:56,394
hot body.

628
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:58,521
Don't be shy.

629
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:00,731
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this...

630
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,484
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

631
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:06,821
You know, the one you were
wearing that red-striped
paisley Armani tie.

632
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:14,287
I want you.
I want you too.

633
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:16,289
Patrick.
What is it?

634
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:19,458
Where are you going?

635
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,295
I've gotta return
some video tapes.

636
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,930
Patrick!

637
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:58,414
Okay, London the...

638
00:49:58,623 --> 00:50:01,292
London, there's, um,
a reservation...
Any Paul Allen?

639
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,794
No.
A reservation, but...
Kimball!

640
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:06,005
I've been wanting
to talk with you.
Come into my office.

641
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:08,049
Jean, great jacket.
Matsuta?

642
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:12,053
Do you remember
where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,

643
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:14,096
which was on
the 20th of December?

644
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:16,182
God.

645
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,352
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.

646
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,774
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.

647
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:27,360
That's not what I've got.
What?

648
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:29,737
That's not the information
I've received.

649
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:32,114
Well, I... Wait.

650
00:50:32,323 --> 00:50:35,159
- What information
have you received?
- Let me see.

651
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:37,995
Well...

652
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,081
You were with...
Well, I could be wrong.

653
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:43,751
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?

654
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,087
We'd gone to a new musical...

655
00:50:46,254 --> 00:50:49,715
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

656
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:52,844
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.

657
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:56,347
I think we had dinner
at Orso's. No, Peto...
No, Orso's.

658
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:59,684
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.

659
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:01,686
I'm a little spent now too.

660
00:51:01,894 --> 00:51:04,939
But how about lunch
in a week or so...

661
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:07,275
when I've sorted out
all this information?

662
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:09,277
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.

663
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:12,530
And if you could
try and pin down
where you were...

664
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:09,735
23.976

665
00:51:12,738 --> 00:51:16,284
the night of Paul Allen's
disappearance, it would
make my job a lot easier.

666
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,818
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.

667
00:51:16,692 --> 00:51:18,861
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.

668
00:51:35,985 --> 00:51:39,322
Not a big music fan, huh?
No, I like music.

669
00:51:39,572 --> 00:51:44,118
Just they're...
Huey's too black sounding
for me.

670
00:51:22,973 --> 00:51:24,808
Huey Lewis and the News.

671
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,645
To each his own.

672
00:51:27,603 --> 00:51:30,773
Great stuff. I just
bought it on my way here.
You heard it?

673
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:50,541
So, lunch next week?

674
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,543
I'll be there.

675
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,680
Oh!

676
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:05,723
Oh!

677
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,874
Will you call me
before Easter?
Maybe.

678
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:37,463
What are you doing tonight?

679
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,258
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

680
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:43,678
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.

681
00:52:45,722 --> 00:52:48,433
I never knew you smoked.

682
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:50,435
You never noticed.

683
00:52:53,813 --> 00:52:55,982
Listen, Patrick.

684
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,900
Can we talk?

685
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:06,367
You look... marvelous.

686
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,288
There's nothing to say.

687
00:53:10,496 --> 00:53:13,958
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special?

688
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:17,420
Patrick?

689
00:53:22,008 --> 00:53:23,843
Yes, Courtney?

690
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:29,265
If I don't see you
before Easter,

691
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,392
have a nice one, okay?

692
00:53:36,522 --> 00:53:38,358
You too.

693
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:46,616
Patrick?

694
00:53:46,783 --> 00:53:48,576
Yeah?

695
00:53:49,952 --> 00:53:54,499
Nothing.

696
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,527
There is this theory now...
Listen to me.

697
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:24,570
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AIDS virus...

698
00:54:24,737 --> 00:54:28,032
by having sex
with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.

699
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:31,494
Alzheimer's,
muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,

700
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:34,330
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.

701
00:54:34,455 --> 00:54:37,083
I'm not sure,
but I don't think dyslexia
is a virus.

702
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,460
But who knows?
They don't know that.

703
00:54:39,669 --> 00:54:41,504
Prove it.

704
00:54:53,182 --> 00:54:55,018
Oh, God.
What?

705
00:54:55,184 --> 00:54:58,479
It's a fucking milligram
of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,

706
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,898
not sprinkle it on
my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,

707
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:03,067
but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it,
we'll be okay.

708
00:55:03,276 --> 00:55:06,654
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs.

709
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:09,073
Fuck you!
Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.

710
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,075
That's right.

711
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:13,161
That is if the faggot
in the next stall
thinks it's okay!

712
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:15,163
Fuck you!
Hey, fuck you!

713
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,043
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

714
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:22,462
Okay, let's do it.

715
00:55:42,482 --> 00:55:45,151
Where did Craig go?

716
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:48,613
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went
to sign a peace treaty...

717
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:50,656
between the United States
and Russia.

718
00:55:50,823 --> 00:55:53,493
He's the one behind Glasnost.

719
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:57,038
- He said he was in
mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you?

720
00:55:57,205 --> 00:55:59,165
No, not really.

721
00:55:59,332 --> 00:56:02,085
- Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.

722
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:04,796
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

723
00:56:05,004 --> 00:56:06,798
Ask me a question.

724
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:10,134
So, what do you do?

725
00:56:10,343 --> 00:56:13,680
I'm into, uh,
well, murders
and executions, mostly.

726
00:56:13,888 --> 00:56:17,642
- Do you like it?
- Well, it depends. Why?

727
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:22,980
Well, most guys I know who work
in mergers and acquisitions
really don't like it.

728
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:28,945
So, where do you work out?

729
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:34,200
You think I'm dumb,
don't you?

730
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:37,328
What?
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

731
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:40,206
No.
I really don't.

732
00:56:40,373 --> 00:56:43,000
That's okay.
I don't mind.

733
00:56:43,209 --> 00:56:45,044
There's something sweet
about you.

734
00:57:11,654 --> 00:57:13,489
Doin' the crossword?

735
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:20,872
You need any help?

736
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,718
- Jean?
- Yes, Patrick?

737
00:57:33,926 --> 00:57:37,096
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner?

738
00:57:37,263 --> 00:57:40,016
That is,
if you're not doing anything.

739
00:57:40,183 --> 00:57:42,810
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.

740
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:47,023
Well,

741
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,319
isn't this a coincidence?

742
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:53,738
Listen, where should we go?
Anywhere you want.

743
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:56,741
Let's not think about
what I want. How about
anywhere you want?

744
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:01,371
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

745
00:58:01,537 --> 00:58:05,166
Come on.
Where do you wanna go?

746
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:10,046
Anywhere you want,
just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.

747
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,090
What about...

748
00:58:20,348 --> 00:58:22,141
Dorsia?

749
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:30,942
So,

750
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:33,528
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.

751
00:58:33,736 --> 00:58:37,281
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.

752
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:39,158
Dorsia is fine.

753
00:58:45,665 --> 00:58:47,500
Dorsia. Yes?

754
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:51,713
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, oh, let's say 9:00?
We're totally booked.

755
00:58:51,921 --> 00:58:53,715
Really? That's great.

756
00:58:53,923 --> 00:58:57,343
No, I said
we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00? Perfect.

757
00:58:57,552 --> 00:58:59,512
See ya then.

758
00:59:02,265 --> 00:59:04,475
Yeah?

759
00:59:04,684 --> 00:59:07,979
You're... dressed okay.

760
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:12,275
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.

761
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:17,113
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...

762
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,574
for drinks.

763
00:59:19,741 --> 00:59:21,576
And Jean,

764
00:59:21,743 --> 00:59:23,661
you'll wanna change
before we go out.

765
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:34,172
Patrick, it's so elegant.

766
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,257
What a wonderful view.

767
00:59:36,424 --> 00:59:38,760
Jean,

768
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,803
sorbet?

769
00:59:42,555 --> 00:59:44,724
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.

770
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:54,567
Do you want a bite?
I'm on a diet.
But thank you.

771
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:58,071
You don't need
to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right?

772
00:59:58,237 --> 01:00:00,239
You look great.
Very fit.

773
01:00:01,657 --> 01:00:04,660
You can always be thinner,
look better.

774
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:09,248
Well, maybe we shouldn't
go out to dinner. I don't
wanna ruin your willpower.

775
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:12,043
No, it's all right.

776
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:15,546
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

777
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:20,134
So listen.

778
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:23,304
What do you really
wanna do with your life?

779
01:00:23,471 --> 01:00:25,598
Just briefly, summarize.

780
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:28,518
And don't tell me
you enjoy working
with children, okay?

781
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:32,939
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,

782
01:00:33,147 --> 01:00:36,025
but I don't really know.

783
01:00:36,192 --> 01:00:40,405
I'm at a point in my life
where there seems to be
so many possibilities,

784
01:00:40,655 --> 01:00:43,991
but I'm... I don't know...
I'm just so unsure.

785
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:50,206
Do you have a boyfriend?

786
01:00:50,373 --> 01:00:54,001
No, not really.
Interesting.

787
01:00:54,168 --> 01:00:57,755
Are you seeing anyone?
I mean, seriously?

788
01:00:57,922 --> 01:01:00,133
Maybe.

789
01:01:00,299 --> 01:01:03,302
I don't know.
Not really.

790
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:08,433
Jean,

791
01:01:08,641 --> 01:01:11,144
do you feel... fulfilled?

792
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,813
I mean, in your life?

793
01:01:14,063 --> 01:01:16,941
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.

794
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:22,113
But now I've really begun
to think about changing myself,
you know,

795
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:24,741
developing and growing.

796
01:01:24,907 --> 01:01:27,994
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.

797
01:01:30,371 --> 01:01:34,667
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,

798
01:01:34,876 --> 01:01:37,920
a collie,
was named Lassie?

799
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:41,382
Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?

800
01:01:43,343 --> 01:01:45,636
Forget it.

801
01:01:45,845 --> 01:01:48,431
What's that?

802
01:01:48,598 --> 01:01:53,436
Duct tape.
I need it for, uh,
taping something.

803
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:01,194
Patrick,

804
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:04,072
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy?

805
01:02:04,238 --> 01:02:06,532
What? No!
Put it in the carton.

806
01:02:09,077 --> 01:02:11,204
Sorry.

807
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:12,997
Jean?

808
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:19,629
What?
Uh, make someone happy?

809
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:23,341
Have you ever wanted to?

810
01:02:25,802 --> 01:02:28,179
I'm looking for, uh,

811
01:02:32,141 --> 01:02:35,269
I guess you could say
I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

812
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:39,148
with someone special.
Hmm.

813
01:02:46,906 --> 01:02:50,201
Patrick? Patrick?
I know you're there.

814
01:02:50,326 --> 01:02:52,370
Pick up the phone,
you bad boy.

815
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,624
What are you up to tonight?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

816
01:02:56,791 --> 01:03:00,878
I hope you're not with some
little number you picked up
because you're my Mr. Bateman.

817
01:03:01,087 --> 01:03:03,589
My boy next door.

818
01:03:03,756 --> 01:03:06,092
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,

819
01:03:06,259 --> 01:03:08,720
and I'll leave
a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

820
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,139
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

821
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:13,516
You know Melania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

822
01:03:13,725 --> 01:03:15,810
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,

823
01:03:15,977 --> 01:03:17,854
so I'll call you
tomorrow morning, honey.

824
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:20,356
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.

825
01:03:20,565 --> 01:03:25,945
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O.
Bye-bye.

826
01:03:29,365 --> 01:03:32,201
Was that Evelyn?

827
01:03:35,163 --> 01:03:37,498
Are you still seeing her?

828
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:44,881
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.

829
01:03:49,802 --> 01:03:52,180
Do you want me to go?

830
01:03:52,305 --> 01:03:54,140
Yeah.

831
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:58,936
I don't think
I can control myself.

832
01:04:01,314 --> 01:04:05,985
I know. I should go.
I know I have a tendency to get
involved with unavailable men.

833
01:04:08,654 --> 01:04:10,448
I mean,

834
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:14,452
do you want me to go?

835
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:17,538
I think if you stay,

836
01:04:17,705 --> 01:04:20,291
something bad will happen.

837
01:04:21,709 --> 01:04:23,503
I think I might hurt you.

838
01:04:25,088 --> 01:04:27,340
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you?

839
01:04:27,548 --> 01:04:29,717
No. No, I guess not.

840
01:04:31,177 --> 01:04:33,721
I don't wanna get bruised.

841
01:04:35,765 --> 01:04:38,559
You're right.
I should go.

842
01:04:44,357 --> 01:04:49,153
Oh. Don't forget you have a
lunch date tomorrow with Donald
Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

843
01:04:50,363 --> 01:04:52,615
Thanks.

844
01:04:52,824 --> 01:04:54,992
It slipped my mind completely.

845
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:18,099
So, the night
he disappeared...

846
01:05:18,266 --> 01:05:20,893
any new thoughts
about what you did?

847
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:26,357
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...

848
01:05:26,566 --> 01:05:28,359
and some sorbet?

849
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:30,486
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

850
01:05:30,653 --> 01:05:32,488
But how?

851
01:05:32,697 --> 01:05:35,658
Where do you place...
Paul that night?

852
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:39,162
According to his date book,
and this was verified
by his secretary,

853
01:05:39,287 --> 01:05:42,123
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.

854
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:44,459
And?
I questioned him.

855
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:48,755
- Marcus?
- Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.

856
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:51,758
But he denied it.
Yes.

857
01:05:53,092 --> 01:05:55,094
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi?

858
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:58,639
Yes.
He does?
You're sure?

859
01:05:58,848 --> 01:06:00,683
I checked it out.
It's clean.

860
01:06:04,854 --> 01:06:08,191
Now, where were you?

861
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:10,318
Where was Marcus?

862
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:12,570
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

863
01:06:12,779 --> 01:06:14,822
Who was he with?
He was...

864
01:06:15,031 --> 01:06:17,408
at Atlantis... with...

865
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:21,537
Craig McDermott,
Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...

866
01:06:21,704 --> 01:06:24,165
and... you.

867
01:06:28,461 --> 01:06:30,254
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.

868
01:06:30,463 --> 01:06:34,509
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,

869
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:36,761
but he had made plans.

870
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:40,765
And I guess I had dinner
with Victoria
the following night.

871
01:06:40,973 --> 01:06:43,226
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

872
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:48,189
Split town for a while.
Maybe he did go to London,
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

873
01:06:48,356 --> 01:06:52,443
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.
I mean, to think...

874
01:06:52,652 --> 01:06:57,824
that one of his friends killed
him for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.

875
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:00,201
Isn't that right, Patrick?

876
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,516
Christie. Christie.

877
01:07:23,683 --> 01:07:27,353
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency
after last time.

878
01:07:27,562 --> 01:07:30,231
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.

879
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:33,067
I don't think so.

880
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:36,404
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

881
01:07:36,612 --> 01:07:38,448
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.

882
01:07:57,342 --> 01:07:59,635
Nothing like last time.
Promise.

883
01:07:59,802 --> 01:08:01,637
All right.

884
01:08:01,804 --> 01:08:05,016
So, you're looking great.
How have you been?

885
01:08:05,183 --> 01:08:08,895
Well, I actually might need
surgery after last time.
Really?

886
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:13,066
My friend told me
I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

887
01:08:13,232 --> 01:08:15,818
Lawyers are so complicated.

888
01:08:15,985 --> 01:08:18,446
Don't do that.

889
01:08:18,654 --> 01:08:20,490
Here's a check.

890
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:12,083
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.

891
01:09:17,422 --> 01:09:20,842
Okay, your name is Christie.

892
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,553
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.

893
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,057
She'll be joining us
in my new apartment shortly.

894
01:09:28,266 --> 01:09:31,602
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.

895
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:41,279
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?

896
01:09:43,823 --> 01:09:46,451
I think I met you
at Surf Bar, didn't I?
With Spicey?

897
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:49,746
Well, maybe not with Spicey,
but definitely at Surf Bar.
You know, Surf Bar.

898
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:51,956
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.

899
01:09:52,123 --> 01:09:57,128
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes.
Oh, my God, please.

900
01:09:57,336 --> 01:09:59,797
This is nicer
than your other apartment.

901
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:04,093
Oh, it's not
that nice.

902
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:12,477
Where did you two meet?
Oh, God.
We met at...

903
01:10:12,685 --> 01:10:16,981
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.

904
01:10:17,148 --> 01:10:20,360
You were hanging out
with that bimbo Allison Poole.
Hot number.

905
01:10:20,568 --> 01:10:22,737
What do you mean?
She was a hot number.

906
01:10:22,904 --> 01:10:27,408
If you had a platinum card,
she'd give you a blow job. This
girl worked in a tanning salon.

907
01:10:27,575 --> 01:10:30,036
What do you do?

908
01:10:30,203 --> 01:10:33,998
She's my... cousin.

909
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:38,002
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.

910
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:41,381
Where's your phone?
I've gotta call Harley.

911
01:10:44,967 --> 01:10:48,554
Where do you summer,
South Hampton?

912
01:10:49,847 --> 01:10:52,892
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.

913
01:10:53,059 --> 01:10:57,021
It's 3:00 in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.

914
01:10:57,188 --> 01:10:59,148
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?

915
01:10:59,357 --> 01:11:01,192
This tastes weird.

916
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,488
Harley, it's me.
I need your services.
Translate that however you want.

917
01:11:05,697 --> 01:11:09,367
- I'm at...
- Paul Allen's.

918
01:11:09,575 --> 01:11:11,703
Who?
Paul Allen's.

919
01:11:11,911 --> 01:11:15,748
I want the number, idiot.
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's
and I'll try you again later.

920
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:19,585
And if I don't see you at Canal
Bar tomorrow night I'm gonna
sic my hairdresser on you.

921
01:11:19,752 --> 01:11:21,587
Did you know that guy
who disappeared?

922
01:11:21,796 --> 01:11:24,590
Didn't he work
at Pierce & Pierce?
Was he a friend of yours?

923
01:11:24,757 --> 01:11:26,592
No.

924
01:11:26,759 --> 01:11:29,554
Do you have any coke?
Or Halcyon?

925
01:11:29,721 --> 01:11:32,640
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.

926
01:11:34,434 --> 01:11:36,394
I would just like to see...

927
01:11:36,602 --> 01:11:38,938
the two of you...
get it on.

928
01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:42,233
What's wrong with that?

929
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,527
It's totally disease free.

930
01:11:46,529 --> 01:11:49,490
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.

931
01:11:49,657 --> 01:11:51,868
Don't you find Christie
attractive?

932
01:11:52,035 --> 01:11:55,705
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.

933
01:11:55,872 --> 01:11:58,082
Come on.

934
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:01,586
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this
all the time?

935
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:07,091
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.

936
01:12:08,676 --> 01:12:10,970
Are you telling me
you've never gotten it on
with a girl?

937
01:12:11,137 --> 01:12:14,182
No. I'm not a lesbian.

938
01:12:14,349 --> 01:12:17,101
Why would you think
I would be into that?

939
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,395
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

940
01:12:19,604 --> 01:12:24,108
Those are
Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.

941
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:30,656
Did you know...

942
01:12:30,823 --> 01:12:34,202
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...

943
01:12:34,327 --> 01:12:37,205
called simply
Whitney Houston...

944
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:40,041
had four number-one
singles on it?

945
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,628
Did you know that,
Christie?

946
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:47,131
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston?

947
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,967
You own
a Whitney Houston CD?

948
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:54,639
More than one?

949
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:58,184
It's hard to choose
a favorite among
so many great tracks.

950
01:13:00,353 --> 01:13:05,066
But the "Greatest Love Of All"
is one of the best,
most powerful songs...

951
01:13:05,233 --> 01:13:07,318
ever written...

952
01:13:07,527 --> 01:13:09,320
about self-preservation...

953
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:11,614
and dignity.

954
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:15,243
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries...

955
01:13:15,368 --> 01:13:17,495
and instills one...

956
01:13:17,704 --> 01:13:21,207
with the hope
that it's not too late...

957
01:13:21,374 --> 01:13:23,584
to better ourselves.

958
01:13:23,835 --> 01:13:27,088
Since, Elizabeth,

959
01:13:27,255 --> 01:13:32,093
it's impossible
in this world we live in
to empathize with others,

960
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:35,763
we can always empathize
with ourselves.

961
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:40,059
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.

962
01:14:55,885 --> 01:14:58,221
Not the face!

963
01:14:58,346 --> 01:15:02,308
You bitch,
not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash!

964
01:15:59,866 --> 01:16:02,869
Aaah!

965
01:16:31,064 --> 01:16:33,691
I want a firm commitment.

966
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,362
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.

967
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,322
Why? What's wrong?

968
01:16:42,909 --> 01:16:44,869
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...

969
01:16:45,036 --> 01:16:47,705
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,

970
01:16:47,914 --> 01:16:50,833
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

971
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:55,213
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick?

972
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:57,340
It's over, Evelyn.

973
01:16:57,548 --> 01:16:59,926
It's all over.

974
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:03,262
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up
the wedding.

975
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:06,891
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right? Now,
are we having coffee?

976
01:17:07,058 --> 01:17:11,729
I'm fucking serious.
It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.

977
01:17:11,938 --> 01:17:14,732
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

978
01:17:14,941 --> 01:17:20,071
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.

979
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:23,449
I really don't think
it would work. You have
a little something...

980
01:17:23,616 --> 01:17:28,913
I know that your friends
are my friends, and, uh...
and I've thought about that.

981
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:32,041
You can have 'em.

982
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:35,586
You're really serious,
aren't you?
Yes, I am.

983
01:17:38,798 --> 01:17:42,844
- What about the past?
Our past?
- We never really shared one.

984
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:44,971
You're inhuman.
No.

985
01:17:45,138 --> 01:17:48,182
I'm in touch with humanity.

986
01:17:48,349 --> 01:17:52,687
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh...

987
01:17:52,895 --> 01:17:54,856
You're not terribly
important to me.

988
01:17:55,023 --> 01:17:57,608
Oh, no!

989
01:17:57,775 --> 01:17:59,944
No. No, Patrick.

990
01:18:00,111 --> 01:18:04,574
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.

991
01:18:06,034 --> 01:18:09,037
What do you want me to do?
What is it that you want?

992
01:18:09,203 --> 01:18:12,457
If you really wanna do something
for me, then stop making
this scene right now.

993
01:18:12,665 --> 01:18:15,460
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

994
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:18,004
I'm leaving.
I've assessed the situation,
and I'm going.

995
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:21,382
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.

996
01:18:21,632 --> 01:18:23,593
But where?

997
01:18:24,844 --> 01:18:26,971
I have to return
some videotapes.

998
01:18:57,877 --> 01:18:59,629
Here, kitty, kitty.

999
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,022
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1000
01:19:18,231 --> 01:19:20,149
Stop that.

1001
01:20:02,066 --> 01:20:04,318
Drop the weapon!
Drop it now!

1002
01:20:04,527 --> 01:20:06,446
Get on the ground!
Put your...

1003
01:20:49,655 --> 01:20:51,991
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith?

1004
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:54,452
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.

1005
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:26,711
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.

1006
01:22:26,878 --> 01:22:29,714
You're my lawyer,
so I think you should know
I've killed a lot of people.

1007
01:22:29,922 --> 01:22:32,633
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,

1008
01:22:32,842 --> 01:22:35,970
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,

1009
01:22:36,095 --> 01:22:38,389
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.

1010
01:22:38,556 --> 01:22:40,725
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1011
01:22:40,892 --> 01:22:43,895
I killed Bethany,
my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.

1012
01:22:44,103 --> 01:22:48,441
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot
with a dog.

1013
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:50,693
Last week, I, uh...

1014
01:22:50,943 --> 01:22:54,364
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.

1015
01:22:57,241 --> 01:23:00,411
I had to.
She almost got away.

1016
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,413
And...

1017
01:23:02,622 --> 01:23:07,627
Someone else there.
I can't remember,
maybe a model... She's dead too.

1018
01:23:07,794 --> 01:23:10,296
And, uh, Paul Allen.

1019
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:14,133
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

1020
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:18,596
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1021
01:23:18,805 --> 01:23:23,351
I don't wanna leave anything
out here. I guess I've killed
maybe... 20 people.

1022
01:23:23,559 --> 01:23:26,521
Maybe 40!

1023
01:23:26,729 --> 01:23:29,982
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1024
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:32,694
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.

1025
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,446
I even, um,

1026
01:23:42,578 --> 01:23:44,956
I ate some
of their brains...

1027
01:23:45,123 --> 01:23:48,751
and I tried to
cook a little.

1028
01:23:51,212 --> 01:23:54,340
Tonight, I, uh...

1029
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:58,428
I just had to kill
a lot of people!

1030
01:23:58,594 --> 01:24:00,596
And, um,

1031
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:08,813
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.

1032
01:24:11,816 --> 01:24:14,736
So, uh... I mean,

1033
01:24:14,902 --> 01:24:18,281
I guess...

1034
01:24:18,406 --> 01:24:20,992
I'm a pretty, uh...

1035
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,996
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.

1036
01:24:25,204 --> 01:24:27,665
So,

1037
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:32,211
if you get back tomorrow,

1038
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:34,547
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1039
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:37,717
So, you know,

1040
01:24:37,925 --> 01:24:39,969
keep your eyes open.

1041
01:24:40,178 --> 01:24:43,139
Okay.

1042
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,145
Oh!

1043
01:26:59,525 --> 01:27:01,778
Are you my 2:00?

1044
01:27:01,903 --> 01:27:05,740
No.
Can I help you?

1045
01:27:06,991 --> 01:27:10,953
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.

1046
01:27:12,205 --> 01:27:15,875
Doesn't he... live here?
No, he doesn't.

1047
01:27:16,084 --> 01:27:18,920
You sure?

1048
01:27:19,128 --> 01:27:21,339
You saw the ad
in the Times?

1049
01:27:21,547 --> 01:27:24,384
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

1050
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:28,012
In the Times.
There was no ad
in the Times.

1051
01:27:29,389 --> 01:27:31,557
I think you should
go now.

1052
01:27:31,724 --> 01:27:33,559
But I think...

1053
01:27:35,311 --> 01:27:37,438
I wanna know
what happened here.

1054
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:40,733
Don't make any trouble,
please.

1055
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,027
I suggest you go.

1056
01:27:54,956 --> 01:27:56,791
Don't come back.

1057
01:27:56,958 --> 01:27:59,002
I won't.

1058
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:01,170
Don't worry.

1059
01:28:28,322 --> 01:28:32,368
Patrick Bateman's office.

1060
01:28:32,618 --> 01:28:36,247
Jean? I need help.
Patrick, is that you?

1061
01:28:37,373 --> 01:28:39,792
Jean, I'm not...

1062
01:28:39,959 --> 01:28:44,380
Craig McDermott called. Wants
to meet you, David Van Patten
and Tim Bryce at Harry's.

1063
01:28:44,589 --> 01:28:48,384
Oh, God.
What did you say,
you dumb bitch?

1064
01:28:48,551 --> 01:28:52,305
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing?

1065
01:28:52,472 --> 01:28:54,349
Where are you, Patrick?
What's wrong?

1066
01:28:56,642 --> 01:29:01,189
I don't think
I'm gonna make it, Jean,
to the, uh,

1067
01:29:01,356 --> 01:29:03,191
office this afternoon.

1068
01:29:03,358 --> 01:29:05,193
Why?

1069
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:09,989
Just say no!
What is it, Patrick?
Are you all right?

1070
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:14,243
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.

1071
01:29:14,494 --> 01:29:16,287
Jesus!

1072
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:38,036
That's a table for three.
Bateman, you're looking
wild-eyed. Rough day?

1073
01:30:38,202 --> 01:30:40,955
Hey, look.
Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.

1074
01:30:41,164 --> 01:30:44,125
He's a changed man,
except for he still can't
a reservation to save his life.

1075
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:46,336
Why don't you just try
150 Wooster?

1076
01:30:46,586 --> 01:30:50,006
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1077
01:30:50,173 --> 01:30:53,885
Le Cirque, Flamingo East,
Oyster Bar. Come on, faggots.
Let's get a "res."

1078
01:30:54,052 --> 01:30:57,722
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1079
01:30:57,889 --> 01:30:59,807
Need a reservation
for 8:30.

1080
01:30:59,974 --> 01:31:02,393
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.

1081
01:31:02,602 --> 01:31:04,896
10:00 would not be
any good. No.

1082
01:31:05,063 --> 01:31:08,274
Just fucking call them.
Give me the phone. I'll do it.
I'll call you back.

1083
01:31:08,524 --> 01:31:11,819
Face it. The Japanese
will own most of this country
by the end of the '90s.

1084
01:31:11,986 --> 01:31:14,864
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.

1085
01:31:16,407 --> 01:31:19,994
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message?

1086
01:31:20,203 --> 01:31:24,290
Jesus, yes.
That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it?

1087
01:31:24,457 --> 01:31:28,127
Yeah, naturally.
Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

1088
01:31:28,294 --> 01:31:30,129
That's fabulous.
That's rich.
What exactly do you mean?

1089
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:34,634
The message you left. By
the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?
You're still seeing her, right?

1090
01:31:34,842 --> 01:31:36,803
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean?

1091
01:31:36,969 --> 01:31:40,390
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.

1092
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,101
Is that Edward Towers?

1093
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:45,019
Carnes, wait. Uh...

1094
01:31:45,228 --> 01:31:50,900
Davis, I'm not one
to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.

1095
01:31:51,109 --> 01:31:54,946
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:

1096
01:31:55,113 --> 01:31:57,073
Bateman is such a dork.

1097
01:31:57,281 --> 01:32:00,785
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.

1098
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:04,747
Now, if you said Bryce
or McDermott. Otherwise,
it was amusing.

1099
01:32:04,914 --> 01:32:07,417
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1100
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:10,962
Wait. Uh... Stop.

1101
01:32:12,338 --> 01:32:14,841
I did it, Carnes.

1102
01:32:15,049 --> 01:32:16,843
I killed him.

1103
01:32:17,093 --> 01:32:19,554
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1104
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:25,018
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.

1105
01:32:26,394 --> 01:32:31,274
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1106
01:32:31,482 --> 01:32:34,193
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.

1107
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,488
No. No, listen.

1108
01:32:37,697 --> 01:32:39,991
Don't you know who I am?

1109
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:42,827
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1110
01:32:45,621 --> 01:32:48,750
We talk on the phone
all the time.

1111
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:51,419
Don't you recognize me?

1112
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,673
You're my lawyer.

1113
01:32:55,882 --> 01:33:00,345
Now, Carnes, listen.

1114
01:33:00,553 --> 01:33:02,722
Listen very, very carefully.

1115
01:33:06,559 --> 01:33:09,771
I killed Paul Allen,

1116
01:33:09,937 --> 01:33:11,814
and I liked it.

1117
01:33:12,023 --> 01:33:15,693
I can't make myself
any clearer.

1118
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:19,864
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny
anymore.

1119
01:33:20,073 --> 01:33:23,493
It never was
supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible?

1120
01:33:23,701 --> 01:33:27,830
It's just not.
Why not,
you stupid bastard?

1121
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:30,208
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...

1122
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:32,835
twice in London
just ten days ago.

1123
01:33:33,002 --> 01:33:35,004
No, you...

1124
01:33:37,924 --> 01:33:40,551
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1125
01:34:21,884 --> 01:34:24,095
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...

1126
01:34:24,262 --> 01:34:27,682
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.

1127
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:32,270
We need to find a way
to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...

1128
01:34:32,437 --> 01:34:34,731
can't be run
by committee.

1129
01:34:34,897 --> 01:34:37,275
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...

1130
01:34:37,483 --> 01:34:41,195
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

1131
01:34:41,362 --> 01:34:45,199
And in the end,
this may be the eventual
blessing in disguise...

1132
01:34:45,408 --> 01:34:47,285
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.

1133
01:34:47,493 --> 01:34:51,039
How can he lie like that?

1134
01:34:51,205 --> 01:34:53,082
How can he pull that shit?
What shit?

1135
01:34:53,249 --> 01:34:55,251
Now, where do we have
reservations at?

1136
01:34:55,335 --> 01:34:58,212
I'm not really hungry,
but I'd like to have
reservations someplace.

1137
01:34:58,463 --> 01:35:01,299
How can you be so fucking,

1138
01:35:01,507 --> 01:35:03,926
I don't know,
cool about it?

1139
01:35:04,052 --> 01:35:07,430
Some guys are just
born cool, I guess.

1140
01:35:12,268 --> 01:35:14,312
Bateman?

1141
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:19,692
- What are you
so fucking zany about?
- I'm just a happy camper.

1142
01:35:19,859 --> 01:35:22,236
Rockin' and a rollin'!

1143
01:35:22,362 --> 01:35:24,364
Oh, brother, look.

1144
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:29,452
He presents himself
as this harmless old codger,
but inside...

1145
01:35:29,619 --> 01:35:32,121
but inside...

1146
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:35,124
But inside doesn't matter.

1147
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:39,462
Inside? Believe or not,
Bryce, we're actually
listening to you.

1148
01:35:39,671 --> 01:35:42,131
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think?

1149
01:35:45,176 --> 01:35:49,347
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?

1150
01:35:49,555 --> 01:35:51,432
I need a scotch.

1151
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:10,702
There are no more barriers
to cross.

1152
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:14,622
All I have in common
with the uncontrollable
and the insane,

1153
01:36:14,789 --> 01:36:18,042
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...

1154
01:36:18,209 --> 01:36:20,169
and my utter indifference
toward it,

1155
01:36:20,378 --> 01:36:22,839
I have now surpassed.

1156
01:36:25,633 --> 01:36:28,469
My pain is constant and sharp...

1157
01:36:28,636 --> 01:36:32,181
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

1158
01:36:32,306 --> 01:36:36,728
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1159
01:36:36,936 --> 01:36:39,355
I want no one to escape.

1160
01:36:40,565 --> 01:36:43,359
But even after admitting this,

1161
01:36:43,568 --> 01:36:45,570
there is no catharsis.

1162
01:36:45,778 --> 01:36:48,406
My punishment continues
to elude me...

1163
01:36:48,656 --> 01:36:51,784
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.

1164
01:36:51,951 --> 01:36:55,580
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1165
01:36:55,788 --> 01:36:59,876
This confession
has meant... nothing.

1166
01:38:18,955 --> 01:38:21,499
Word.

1167
01:39:15,762 --> 01:39:18,556
Come on.
