00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:10,184
<i>¶¶ We'll meet again</i>

2
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,184
<i>¶¶ Don't know where</i>

3
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,184
<i>¶¶ Don't know when</i>

4
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,750
<i>¶¶ But I know
we'll meet again</i>

5
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>¶¶ Some sunny day</i>

6
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:29,000
<i> ¶¶ Keep smiling' thru</i>

7
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:34,000
<i> ¶¶ Just like you always do</i>

8
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:41,000
<i> ¶¶ Till the blue skies drive

00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:46,300
<i>¶¶ And will you please say hello</i>

10
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,784
Dr. Dutton... My aunt is in town.

11
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:59,501
- And she's sick too.
- I'm goanna need you to stay late, tonight.

12
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:01,041
- You know... You should probably
- Oh, you are?

13
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:05,297
text your "aunt" Scotty and tell him
you can't make it to the baseball game today.

14
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,182
Oh, wait a second...How...
Okay look, Scotty and I were...

15
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:09,016
Oh, c'mon Becky.

16
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:11,016
- I mean...
- It's the worst kept secret in town.

17
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:16,627
Now, that's saying a lot! Go on,
get out of here. Go and have some fun.

18
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,127
Thanks, Dr. Dutton.

19
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:37,629
Well, I don't care what the calendar says.
Opening day, that's first day of spring.

20
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,567
- No, no, no, Sheriff never pays for coffee.
- Well, that's kind of you Ben...

21
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:45,024
But the Principal's star
has to pay his parking tickets.

22
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,070
- Start him a tab.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,644
- That kid throws fast.
- Just like he drives. Nice pitch, Scotty!

24
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,353
See middle-field.

25
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:29,835
Oh, Jesus Christ!

26
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,076
Tommy!

27
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:39,020
- Stay there.
- Boys, get in the dugout.

28
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,270
- Get them off the field!
- Get them in the dugout, Principal.

29
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,275
Hey Rory,
we got a ball game going on here.

30
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,227
We are playing ball and you come out with a gun?!
What the hell are you doing?!

31
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:59,072
Oh Rory... You are drunk. That's all.

32
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:01,630
Now, let's just...lay the gun down.

33
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:06,758
Rory... Lay the gun down...

34
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,452
Lay it down.

35
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:12,843
Rory.

36
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,751
Rory?

37
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:20,614
Now, you lay the gun down.

38
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:27,865
Rory?

39
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:31,742
Oh, my God!

40
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:08,103
I'll have the blood alcohol report in the morning.

41
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:11,196
Full tux screen take about a week.

42
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,276
How are you holding up, David?

43
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:20,703
- Is Peggy here yet?
- She just walked in with the boy.

44
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:26,536
David, perhaps now is not the best time.

45
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,886
Son... Settle down.

46
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:40,069
Hey Curt...I'm so sorry.

47
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,095
I liked Rory...
I liked him a lot.

48
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,862
- What he was doing out there?
- He's been drinking.

49
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:50,005
- That's all.
- Rory quit two years ago...

50
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,705
You know how proud he was of that.

51
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:56,476
Is that what you are saying?
That he was drunk?

52
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:57,976
- Is that what you are telling people?
- No...

53
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,907
You had to do it?
Had to shoot the damn drunk?

54
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,463
You did the right thing.

55
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,714
- I need to blame for this.
- Hey, David..

56
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:44,287
You did the right thing.

57
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,679
She's been sleeping?

58
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:12,455
Sheriff's department.
No Ma'am, we can't comment on that.

59
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:13,465
That's an ongoing investigation.

60
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:19,122
No Ma'am... the Sheriff is not here right now,
but I can see if the Deputy will...

61
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,696
Amateurs.

62
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:25,765
Sheriff's department.

63
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:30,526
That's the medical examiner on line two.

64
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:36,936
Good morning Jim.
What've we got?

65
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,009
<i>- The results were negative.
- Tell me again?</i>

66
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,309
There was no alcohol...

67
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,118
No, I heard what you said Jim,
but that's not right.

68
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:46,277
<i>- Rory was...
-David, I did the test twice.</i>

69
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:49,952
<i>Rory wasn't drunk,
there's no use of alcohol in his bloodstream.</i>

70
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:52,952
<i>It takes sometimes a couple days,
a week or so. I don't know what's going' on.</i>

71
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,892
Yeah okay. Thank you.

72
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,782
Ben!

73
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:41,703
Hey Ben. Ben!

74
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:46,221
Ben! Hey, you alright?

75
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:56,664
Don't worry... The kids are resiled.
They'll be alright.

76
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:00,293
I'm late... I got to go.

77
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,606
- Deidra, Bill.
- Hey Judy.

78
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:07,570
Little man. How are you all doing??

79
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,527
- Would you mind take a look at Bill?
- Sure, what's wrong?

80
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:14,527
I don't know.
He's just... not alright.

81
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,536
How are you feeling, Bill?
Any pain or discomfort?

82
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:28,258
- Bill?
- She worries too much. I'm fine.

83
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:33,517
- Just a little tired.
- You got any plans this weekend?

84
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,461
She worries too much. I'm fine.
Just a little tired.

85
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,258
His vitals are fine.

86
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,360
You know, I got to see a patient
in Cedar Rapids on Monday..

87
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:47,290
I want to take Bill and to get a CT scan...

88
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:51,899
- Monday?
- Yeah. Let's just make sure it's nothing serious.

89
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:57,635
- If you need me, you call me. Day or night. Okay?
- Thanks Judy.

90
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:01,049
- See you Nicholas.
- Bye Judy. - Bye Bill.

91
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:39,634
What's Dad doing?

92
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:44,620
Wait here, Nicholas.

93
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,821
William!

94
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,053
William!

95
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,952
William!

96
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,754
William!

97
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,565
<i>- Mom!
- Oh God! Nicholas!!!</i>

98
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:37,874
Nicholas!

99
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,583
Nicholas, are you okay?!

100
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,285
Nicholas, what happened?

101
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:59,342
- It's Dad.
- Where is Dad? What happened?

102
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:03,376
Honey, please talk to me. Please.

103
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:07,003
He has a knife.

104
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:09,857
Oh my God.

105
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,658
Stay back. Stay right there.

106
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:59,266
William!

107
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:19,625
<i>William, please, let us out of here!</i>

108
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,412
Hello?

109
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:47,743
I'm coming'.

110
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:52,589
What is it?

111
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,808
- Deidra! - Tom, did they get out?
- Not Deidra and Nicholas. Just Bill.

112
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,500
I need two men on that edge-cliff border,
how's that.

113
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:09,031
When we got here,
there was an empty gas can

114
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:12,296
just sitting' in front, and Bill..
he was pulling' a goddamn mower.

115
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:19,708
Bill?!

116
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,718
What the hell happened here?

117
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,186
- God! Oh God!
- Judy c'mon.

118
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,650
What the fuck have you done?!

119
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:10,193
What the hell?!

120
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,801
What you've got?

121
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:33,085
Russ, did you get in touch with
Sheriff Burns in Cedar Rapids?

122
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:37,918
Russ?

123
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,918
Yeah, State Trooper is coming
this afternoon to pick him up for transfer.

124
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,499
- How long he's been playing a statue?
- A couple of hours now.

125
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:50,268
Same look Rory gave me.
The same goddamn look.

126
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,428
<i>Sheriff's department.</i>

127
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,344
It's been there at least
a week by the looks of things.

128
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:21,551
- I'll check to see if there is any identifications.
- Yeah. Do that.

129
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,018
Lewis, last I checked
the hunting season ended three months ago.

130
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,126
We were just out taking in a little nature.
Fresh air is all.

131
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:34,050
- Guns away 'till fall.
- Oh c'mon, Sheriff. - Are you kidding me?

132
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,220
Well, the guy is a pilot.
Where is the plane?

133
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:43,116
Well, last week Travis Quinn
was going around saying he heard

134
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,016
something crashed out by the Hop man bar.

135
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,320
- I didn't think nothing of it.
- On account of him being full of shit?

136
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,820
That's the general rule.

137
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,768
- Well, maybe this is the exception.
- Maybe.

138
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:04,282
- Shit sounded like a plane truck.
- Sheriff, about the reward?

139
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:07,020
- Shit. Big plane? Little plane? What? C'mon now...
- Well, if he can explain

140
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,758
the difference how those two sound,
I might be able to figure it out.

141
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,713
You are full of shit.
He's full of shit.

142
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:14,946
People only ask for reward,
when there's something to be find.

143
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:17,650
- Is there goanna be a big reward, Sheriff?
- Travis, if you ask about that again,

144
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:21,286
- I'm goanna throw you out of the fucking boat.
- You're not goanna shoot me?

145
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,071
- Travis?
- Yeah?

146
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,971
Kill the engine.

147
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,791
- It's a big plane, Russ.
- Why is that?

148
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,695
'Cause we are right on top of it.

149
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:12,302
- Kevin, which way is water flowing through the town?
- Nice to see you too, Dave.

150
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,675
- Waste water or drinking?
- Drinking.

151
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:15,975
Give me a sec.

152
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:21,422
Plane that size goes down, and nothing
in the paper, nothing in the news.

153
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:24,463
- Make any sense to you?
- It depends on what the payload is.

154
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:27,649
- Exactly what I'm thinking.
- Which is what?

155
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,035
- Hop man bar, where it's draining to?
- Dwight Creek.

156
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:33,035
- Where it's raising to?
- Black pawn.

157
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,104
- Oh, you remember that monster catfish?
- What do you think we are getting' our drinking water from?

158
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:40,122
Treated water comes in from the north.

159
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:42,428
- Breaks east- west.
- What house is to get it first?

160
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:46,311
Let's see. Rory Hamill.

161
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:57,862
You want to shut out the entire town's
water supply on a hunch?

162
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,823
Mayor, I've got three dead bodies
in the morgue in the last 48 hours.

163
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:05,376
David, take a look around you.
This is a farming community.

164
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:09,518
It is spring time, it's planting season.
You turn off the water, you're goanna kill the crops.

165
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:12,925
You kill the crops and you bankrupt
every family in Pierce County.

166
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:17,727
And that is not based on some..hunch.
That's a fact.

167
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:21,159
Water...Stays on.

168
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:39,056
Sheriff, I'm on for a little
civil disobedience...

169
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,458
but I think this whole thing
might cost you your job.

170
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:46,338
You know what, Russ?

171
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:51,021
That wouldn't be such a bad thing.

172
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:04,491
What the fuck?

173
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:16,383
Stay on a second.

174
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:21,229
Is he dead?

175
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:25,863
Well, if he is he won't mind waiting'.

176
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,877
Jesus Christ!

177
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:38,656
Did we or did we not,
request a transfer for him this morning?

178
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:51,274
Even better.

179
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,657
- You know what?
- What?

180
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,550
We are in trouble.

181
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,571
Hello?

182
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:45,085
<i>All things wise and wonderful,
and our Lord loves them all.</i>

183
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,818
Jim?

184
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:42,729
Jim?

185
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:30,237
Jesus Christ!

186
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:42,819
Behind you.

187
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,383
Christ Almighty!

188
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:09,259
David, I'm not goanna do this.
I can't go to my parents.

189
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,216
- You have no idea what...
- And neither do you?!

190
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:15,058
Look whatever it is, I can't just leave.
Are you goanna leave?

191
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:17,271
- I am the Sheriff.
- I am their doctor.

192
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,926
Yeah...Well, if it turns out what
they need is penicillin, I'll call you.

193
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:23,612
- David.
- What?!

194
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,489
What?

195
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:30,535
There's somebody outside.

196
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:24,449
<i>David!</i>

197
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:42,661
- David, what's going on?? -I don't know...
Right now I don't know any more than you do.

198
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:45,526
Funny thing happened
on the road to Cedar Rapids.

199
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,549
The bastards fired my tires.

200
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:50,838
Who are these fuckers man?

201
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,152
<i>Keep moving.</i>

202
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,073
<i>Keep moving, please.</i>

203
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,080
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

204
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,191
<i>Stay in line, sir.
Keep on the group, please.</i>

205
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,531
<i>Inside, please.</i>

206
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,122
<i>Please, keep moving. Let's go!</i>

207
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:47,804
<i>Keep moving, please.</i>

208
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,026
Why don't you guys tell me,
what's going on?

209
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:51,647
<i>Sorry Sir,
you have to keep moving.</i>

210
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,471
Asshole!
Don't touch me! Asshole!

211
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,699
Help! Help!

212
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,527
What are you people doing?!

213
00:30:06,247 --> 00:30:09,128
<i>This facility is under command and control...</i>

214
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,200
- What does it mean? Judy, what does it mean?
- They are checking for elevated temperatures.

215
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:15,250
Barnum was bleeding from the nose
so was Rory.

216
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:18,582
Well, cerebral haemorrhage.
It's got to be some kind of virus.

217
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:22,030
Look, I'm a Sheriff, she's a doctor.
We know these people.

218
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,991
What the fuck is going' on in here?
Would you please tell us

219
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:25,952
what's going' on?
Maybe we can actually help you.

220
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:29,209
David!

221
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:34,406
David!

222
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:38,902
Wait!

223
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:44,210
Wait!

224
00:30:44,902 --> 00:30:48,147
- David! David! Help!
- Judy!

225
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,317
David! David! David!

226
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:58,788
Please. Please. Help me, please.

227
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:11,386
<i>Keep on moving.
Keep on moving</i>

228
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:22,982
Please, please, don't please, don't.

229
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:33,248
No, no! Please, please I'm pregnant!
Please, no!

230
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,234
<i>Let's go! Don, Franklin,
open these doors!</i>

231
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:07,379
<i>Move people, we are getting' you
out of here. Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

232
00:32:15,073 --> 00:32:17,195
Let's go, let's go!

233
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:27,450
- Kevin, where is Linda?
- They took her.

234
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:29,450
- Judy?
- They took her too.

235
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,710
They took George and Francine and
Whitney, Simon and whole mass of other people.

236
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,685
- Kevin! Kevin!
- Mom!

237
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:40,948
- We are going back.
- They got the whole town sealed off.

238
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:44,789
Road blocks on every highway.
Tim Mitchell tried to run one,

239
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,954
they shot him dead and his entire family.

240
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,802
David, this here,
might be our only chance.

241
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:52,154
Don't lose it to run off
on some fool's errand.

242
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:56,720
- Judy is fool's errand?
- You know what I am saying.

243
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:03,662
I'll tell you what Kiev, don't ask me why
I can't leave without my wife.

244
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:05,583
And I won't ask you why you can.

245
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:17,981
<i>We got a breach in the yard!
Move out! Move out! Let's go! Evacuate!</i>

246
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:20,994
<i>C'mon! Let's go, let's go!
The crazies are breached the corridor!</i>

247
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:23,011
<i>C'mon! Move out!</i>

248
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:24,963
<i>We got to get out of here!</i>

249
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:18,505
Nice to see you too, chief.

250
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,448
Shit!

251
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:30,025
- How did you get out?
- Tom Alice

252
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,025
went with his pickup through the fence.

253
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:34,374
And fucking military started shooting.
Town's folks going nuts.

254
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,028
Before you know, the people were just
running' off on the field.

255
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:41,328
David, Judy was still inside.
I'm sorry.

256
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:44,333
She's not sick. She's been running
a fever all month. Russ, she's pregnant.

257
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,306
- It's about time.
- I'm goanna go get her.

258
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:50,517
Boo-fucking-yah...
Let's gobble the high school!

259
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:15,996
Becca? Becca, is that you?

260
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:22,298
Oh God! Honey...honey, are you hurt?

261
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:29,223
- Is this really happening?
- It's goanna be alright. We're goanna be okay.

262
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:31,699
You don't really believe that, do you?

263
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:43,992
Becca! Oh shit!

264
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,741
Please, stop! Please, let me go!
Please, don't do this!

265
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,741
No, please don't do this!
Please..No, no, please!

266
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:09,173
Shit!

267
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:19,816
No! Stop! No, please!

268
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:23,794
No, please! Just get out of here!

269
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,976
Oh God!

270
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:57,615
- Are you okay?
- No, not really.

271
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:03,211
- Chief?
- We got to get quick to fuel truck stop...

272
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:06,510
135. They're putting' people on busses
and get them out of here.

273
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:10,231
We're goanna go. C'mon.

274
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:17,998
<i>Did Peter call?
Did Peter call?</i>

275
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,214
- It's got to be me.
- Russell,

276
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,214
I had enough problems
without you and then...

277
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:28,089
It's easy for you to say. You are at the end
of the pipe, I'm a half-mile from the farm.

278
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,422
- Who is the Sheriff?
- What?

279
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:32,022
- Who is the Sheriff of the Pierce County?
- You are.

280
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:34,813
- I am. Who's the Deputy?
- That would be me.

281
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:37,803
You are. Deputy does what the Sheriff tells him
and that's the balance of power.

282
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:42,989
And I'm telling... You are not getting sick.
You understand me?

283
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,011
<i>Did Peter call?</i>

284
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:55,085
I hope you are right, Chief. I didn't
owe the world, but I had plans.

285
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:59,659
C'mon.

286
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:13,228
Let's go.

287
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:42,760
I'll check the truck.

288
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:51,244
Oh shit! It's brooded.

289
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:55,872
- They all are.
- I'll check those cars.

290
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:07,519
It's not brooded.

291
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:19,359
- Russell, get out of the truck.
- Give me a sec...

292
00:42:22,057 --> 00:42:25,898
Run!
Go, go, go, go!

293
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:37,528
C'mon, boy. Run out...

294
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,798
Run, little man, run!

295
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,703
- Oh yeah!
- Good shot!

296
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,895
- C'mon. Weft him.
- Straight through the heart.

297
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:40,846
- Good shot, man!
- You have something about that shot?!

298
00:44:02,288 --> 00:44:04,209
It's a hell of the walk to Quick Falls.

299
00:44:06,634 --> 00:44:09,636
- Get the old cruiser of the blocks.
- That piece of shit still works?

300
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:13,524
- Yeah.
- Just I can't blow the car without wheels.

301
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:17,795
- It's only seven miles to my place.
- It's five, if we cut through McGregor's farm.

302
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,749
And one-twenty to Quick Falls from there.

303
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:23,071
- I'm fine.
- Good, let's go.

304
00:44:31,056 --> 00:44:32,994
They took my blood.

305
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,539
Or at least one test,
that I saw.

306
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,989
What if the reason they didn't
let me go, because I have it?

307
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,911
You're pregnant,
that's why you have a fever.

308
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:51,738
- David, we can't know that for sure.
- I can, and I do.

309
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:55,801
You're sick, I'm sick.
We drink from the same tap.

310
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:58,870
I'm not sick.
None of us are.

311
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:06,412
We're goanna get through this.

312
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:15,185
- What the fuck?
- Scotty McGregor.

313
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,597
- It's her boyfriend.
- Russell, stop her.

314
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:19,254
Yeah, I got it.

315
00:45:19,255 --> 00:45:21,275
- David?
- We don't have time for this.

316
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:23,275
You had time for me.

317
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:30,275
Let's go.

318
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,815
- Looks deserted.
- Scotty?

319
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:42,184
- Scotty?
- Get back!

320
00:45:42,185 --> 00:45:43,484
Drop your fucking gun, Scotty.

321
00:45:43,485 --> 00:45:45,825
- I'll blow your head off, do you hear me?
- Scotty, it's me!

322
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:47,876
Stay here.

323
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:51,230
Scotty, don't be an asshole.
We're fine.

324
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:56,117
- Scotty!
- Scotty, put the gun down.

325
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,250
- Put it down!
- Scotty?

326
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:12,252
Sorry.

327
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:17,905
- I had to be sure.
- Yeah. Well, that's two-way street here, Scotty.

328
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,835
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

329
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,226
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

330
00:46:26,227 --> 00:46:27,326
Scotty, where's your mom?

331
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,729
Back at the house. We're just getting
some supplies before the sun woke.

332
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,847
Well, the sheriff got a car.
You two can come with us.

333
00:46:33,236 --> 00:46:35,952
Are you okay?
How's your mom?

334
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,952
Be quiet.

335
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:41,198
Get in the barn! Go, go, go.

336
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:13,891
Russ.

337
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:24,472
<i> We have one civilian.
Coming' out!</i>

338
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:30,456
<i>- Wait!
- Everything's goanna be okay ma'am, we just need to process you.</i>

339
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:43,774
Hold up right there!
Stay where you are!

340
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,249
<i>OK, let's go. Split up.
We got to complete sweeping the area.</i>

341
00:48:10,564 --> 00:48:12,785
Take Becca,
go to the back of the barn.

342
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:45,801
Don't kill me, please.
Don't kill me.

343
00:48:45,802 --> 00:48:49,179
- Oh, fuck.
- How could you do it? How could you...?

344
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:52,862
You make a sound out of the mess,
and I'll kill you, you understand?

345
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:54,537
- What the hell was that?
- Orders, sir.

346
00:48:54,538 --> 00:48:55,807
From where, asshole?

347
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,354
- Whoever gives them, I don't know.
- Bullshit. What the fuck is going on here?

348
00:48:58,742 --> 00:49:00,662
All they said, is intervene in
some sort of accident.

349
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:03,331
My whole unit got flown here,
we didn't even know what's the state,

350
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:04,331
until we've seen a license of it.

351
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:13,068
Am I goanna die,
that my mask's gone?

352
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:18,868
Is that what they told you?
If you took your mask off, you're goanna die?

353
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:22,049
They said to keep it on.

354
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:24,826
Look...

355
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,508
I know I don't deserve
any favours from you people,

356
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,813
but if you let me go,
I swear to God, I won't say nothing.

357
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:32,936
I didn't sign up
to shoot unarmed civilians.

358
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:36,141
- I'll just leave here, okay?
- Sit down.

359
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:37,741
- Put the gun down, Russ.
- Chief?

360
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:42,710
I'm a sheriff.
That's my deputy.

361
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:46,456
My wife is a doctor, she's pregnant.
Becca here is not even 18.

362
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:49,236
- He blabs, they'll find us.
- If we didn't let him go, they'll find us for sure.

363
00:49:49,914 --> 00:49:52,596
Beside... he's not goanna blab.

364
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:55,614
No, sir.

365
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:07,760
- You got to give it to him, Russ.
- Shit!

366
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:10,056
Sorry about your folks town.

367
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,963
- Hey! Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

368
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:15,386
Any crazies back there, Babcock?

369
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:20,134
Babcock?

370
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:23,996
- No, all clear.
- Good. Military's point back to the perimeter.

371
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:26,175
Let's go, come on!

372
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:30,990
<i> The barn is clear.
We're secured back there.</i>

373
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:34,949
<i>Alright. Moving' out.</i>

374
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:57,842
If what that soldier said is true,
this disease is gone airborne.

375
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:02,796
We just have to keep going.

376
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,107
We're going to get the car running.
Come on.

377
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:23,445
It's perfect.

378
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:29,595
It's a perfect, beautiful morning,
and this is our home.

379
00:52:30,078 --> 00:52:31,949
This is where we're goanna
raise our baby.

380
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,949
We're still got all those things.

381
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:39,973
Everyone we know,
is dead.

382
00:52:43,784 --> 00:52:46,918
This town is dead,
and it's not coming back.

383
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:51,423
It's never coming back.

384
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,246
Fuck ya! See if you can
find a tool box.

385
00:53:35,506 --> 00:53:37,427
This is goanna be your room.

386
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:26,112
Judy?

387
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:32,785
Look, I know this is hard
but we've got to keep moving....

388
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:05,687
This is the gun
that killed your father.

389
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:18,389
Peggy, no.
Not Judy.

390
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,041
I shot him. I-I... I shot...
Yes!

391
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,895
Peggy, I shot him.
Look at me, you crazy bitch!

392
00:55:29,094 --> 00:55:32,615
That's it!
I fuckin' shot him! I did it!

393
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:35,620
When he walked on
that field, with a loaded shotgun.

394
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,753
Thanks God I did. They could
give me a fuckin' medal.

395
00:55:39,463 --> 00:55:42,108
Finally killed the damn drunk!

396
00:56:34,128 --> 00:56:38,049
- Oh my God.
- Let me see your hand.

397
00:56:38,488 --> 00:56:40,408
Give me the bandage.

398
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,796
Russell!

399
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:04,960
Just making sure.

400
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,501
He is sick, David.

401
00:57:23,683 --> 00:57:26,032
- We don't know that.
- You saw what he did.

402
00:57:26,128 --> 00:57:28,823
Hey, guys!
Come on, we got to go.

403
00:57:31,986 --> 00:57:34,635
He saved our lives.
That's what I saw.

404
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:22,925
- Hey. You feeling' okay?
- I'm fine.

405
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:25,502
Well, I'm just saying,
if she is getting sick, we don't want to be

406
00:58:25,598 --> 00:58:26,941
- in the fucking car with her.
- Russell, she's fine.

407
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:28,941
I'm not sick.

408
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:32,721
We wouldn't know. This got to be
the sickness messing with your mind.

409
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:36,741
Okay, Russell. That's enough.
Don't lose your head.

410
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:41,167
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean, don't lose your head.

411
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,332
- What do you mean by that, chief?
- I mean...

412
00:58:45,385 --> 00:58:47,305
She's fine.

413
00:58:48,454 --> 00:58:50,374
Now, just...

414
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:54,155
Fuck!

415
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:57,434
- Did they see us?
- I don't know.

416
00:59:00,826 --> 00:59:01,535
- Honey.
- Oh, shit!

417
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:03,960
Guys, turn around.
They're coming' back.

418
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:06,190
- We got to get out of here!
- Let's go.

419
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:10,507
-The helicopter is coming.
- Chief, let's go!

420
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:35,975
We can't stay on the highway.
There's got to be another road we can take.

421
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:38,193
- What road, Judy? Tell me?
- I don't know. There's got to be something.

422
00:59:38,194 --> 00:59:41,855
What road can they not see?
Tell me? What road can they not see?

423
00:59:42,147 --> 00:59:43,603
What magic road,
can they not see?

424
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:47,735
- Tell me, how fucking go?
- David, I'm just trying to help.

425
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:53,629
I'm sorry.

426
00:59:56,457 --> 00:59:58,377
- I saw someone!
- Move. Where?

427
00:59:59,074 --> 01:00:00,994
It was back there.
I know, I saw someone.

428
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:06,099
Fuck!

429
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:12,755
David, get us out of here.

430
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:19,006
- Oh, shit!
- Start the car.

431
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:20,927
Come on!
Come on, chief.

432
01:00:21,947 --> 01:00:23,867
Let's go.
Come on, get us out of here.

433
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:29,683
Let's go.
Let's go!

434
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:41,428
Come on!
Let's go!

435
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:48,194
- Why aren't we moving?
- Why the fuck aren't we moving', chief?

436
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:49,474
Because I can't get
a fucking contraction.

437
01:00:49,475 --> 01:00:51,474
Go! Go!

438
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:53,395
Fuck! let's go.
Get us out of here.

439
01:00:55,388 --> 01:01:00,308
- I don't want to die like this.
- What the fuck was that?

440
01:01:03,396 --> 01:01:06,835
- Russell!
- Russell... Russ...

441
01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:11,938
Russell!

442
01:01:12,571 --> 01:01:14,427
- Russell!
- I saw a movement!

443
01:01:14,428 --> 01:01:16,427
Everything is fucking moving.

444
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,780
Just drive! Come on!

445
01:02:07,918 --> 01:02:10,839
- Stop the fucking car!
- Stop!

446
01:02:11,187 --> 01:02:13,052
- Stop.
- Judy.

447
01:02:15,914 --> 01:02:19,067
David!
Come on. Help me!

448
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:21,075
Oh, God. Please.

449
01:02:23,644 --> 01:02:26,164
Becca! Becca!

450
01:03:49,286 --> 01:03:53,371
It's my truck.
The fuckers fired my tires.

451
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:21,131
- Goddammit!
- We need water.

452
01:04:22,627 --> 01:04:25,613
- I know
- Guys! Car coming!

453
01:04:36,161 --> 01:04:38,082
Stay here.

454
01:04:38,455 --> 01:04:40,976
- David, what are you doing'?
- We're taking this car.

455
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:57,871
- Fuck!
- Russ, what are you... No!

456
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:26,850
Welcome to Pierce County.
The friendliest place on earth, asshole.

457
01:05:27,496 --> 01:05:29,416
Russ, I want to talk to him.

458
01:05:30,985 --> 01:05:32,906
Okay.

459
01:05:33,622 --> 01:05:36,316
- What the fuck do you think you are?
- I am the guy, standing between you,

460
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:37,316
and a bullet.

461
01:05:37,383 --> 01:05:40,304
Now, what was on that plane?

462
01:05:41,227 --> 01:05:43,650
What was on,
that goddamn plane?

463
01:05:44,004 --> 01:05:46,995
Trixie. Rhabdoviridae prototype.

464
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:52,297
- A fucking biological weapon!
- It was headed to incinerator in Texas.

465
01:05:52,436 --> 01:05:55,682
You're telling' me,
that you guys, engineered this crap?

466
01:05:55,683 --> 01:05:58,930
It's designed to destabilize the population.
In this case, the wrong one.

467
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:02,258
Look fella, we lost a plane.
What do you want me to say?

468
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:08,105
How about "Sorry, for destroying
your whole goddamn town?"

469
01:06:08,202 --> 01:06:10,077
- David, wait.
- What would you've preferred?

470
01:06:10,078 --> 01:06:11,434
A global pandemic?

471
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,499
I take it up with the pilot.
I came here to help.

472
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:18,000
- Help who? Help us?
- What.. what is the incubation period?

473
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:21,448
48 hours. After that,
you're either dead, or you don't have it.

474
01:06:21,802 --> 01:06:25,943
Fine. It's day 3, and we're still
talking. So, you are goanna help us...

475
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:30,557
Fuck!

476
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:32,478
- No, no, no, no!
- Oh my God!

477
01:06:32,495 --> 01:06:33,752
What the fuck is the matter
with you?

478
01:06:33,753 --> 01:06:36,952
I said, that I wanted to talk to him.

479
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:39,230
You talked.

480
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,080
Shit.

481
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:16,269
- I'm goanna need that back.
- I'll carry it for a while.

482
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:19,162
- You've been carrying' it the whole time.
- No, not really.

483
01:07:19,163 --> 01:07:20,987
I got it.

484
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:24,435
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

485
01:07:37,107 --> 01:07:40,016
- Russell. We're on your side.
- My side? Shit.

486
01:07:40,049 --> 01:07:41,793
- I didn't even know there were sides.
- There's not. I'm just saying...

487
01:07:41,794 --> 01:07:43,733
- Shut the fuck up!
- no side, I've been...

488
01:07:43,734 --> 01:07:45,233
- Russell! No!
- Tell her to shut up, or I'll kill her,

489
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:47,187
- do you understand?
- Judy, stop talking.

490
01:07:48,124 --> 01:07:50,044
Let him think about
what he's doing.

491
01:07:53,648 --> 01:07:57,489
One... Two... Three...

492
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:02,888
That's how many times
I saved your life.

493
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:08,121
Go on. Walk where I can see ya.

494
01:08:09,317 --> 01:08:11,237
Move!

495
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,791
That's fuckin' heavy.

496
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:45,144
Move! Move!

497
01:08:54,932 --> 01:08:57,870
- Fuck it. I'm goanna confront him.
- David, don't, please.

498
01:08:57,873 --> 01:08:59,811
If we don't make it to
that truck stop, we're dead anyway.

499
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,670
- David, don't.
- Back off!

500
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:06,490
- I want to talk to you.
- I'll fuckin' shoot you where you stand.

501
01:09:06,498 --> 01:09:08,085
- Just want to talk.
- David, stop!

502
01:09:08,098 --> 01:09:10,945
- You better listen to me.
- David.

503
01:09:10,954 --> 01:09:12,068
- Put the gun down.
- Final warning, chief.

504
01:09:12,187 --> 01:09:16,107
Put it down. Please.
Just put it down.

505
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,274
I just want to talk.

506
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:21,373
You and me, man to man.

507
01:09:23,169 --> 01:09:25,089
Come on.

508
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:28,821
- Shit.
- Okay. Here's a deal.

509
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:50,267
Remember that monster catfish
I caught last summer?

510
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:53,258
What the weight you reckon?

511
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:56,910
35-40 Pounds.

512
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,933
Shit. It's a big
son of a bitch.

513
01:10:14,113 --> 01:10:16,034
I'm not alright, am I?

514
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:29,442
Can I walk with you guys?

515
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,319
A little while longer?

516
01:10:35,339 --> 01:10:37,260
Please.

517
01:11:11,748 --> 01:11:14,558
If you got through there, you can make it
to the highway on the other side.

518
01:11:14,914 --> 01:11:17,337
- They'll see us.
- No, they'll be focusing on me.

519
01:11:19,082 --> 01:11:22,923
Deputy does what the sheriff
tells him, right? You're the sheriff.

520
01:11:25,251 --> 01:11:30,092
Come on, chief. I am done.
I'm goanna die here, no matter what.

521
01:11:30,776 --> 01:11:32,696
So, let it mean something.

522
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:35,776
let that mean you two made it.
Give me that.

523
01:11:56,374 --> 01:11:58,295
Boo-fucking-yah.

524
01:12:03,832 --> 01:12:07,124
<i>Attention! You have entered
a prohibited zone of a massive military operation</i>

525
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,857
<i>Please, identify yourself.</i>

526
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:12,612
My name is, Deputy Russell Clark,
the Pierce County sheriff department.

527
01:12:12,616 --> 01:12:15,035
<i>- It's okay. I'm not sick.
- Keep your hands in the air</i>

528
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:18,070
<i>make no sudden movements,
or you will be fired upon.</i>

529
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,336
<i>We have a fire operation.</i>

530
01:12:20,432 --> 01:12:22,142
<i>Get up behind the vehicle.</i>

531
01:12:32,226 --> 01:12:34,627
<i>Show yourself,
or we will open fire.</i>

532
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:42,236
It's okay. It's okay.

533
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:45,078
<i>Now stop there,
and get down on the ground.</i>

534
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:47,078
<i>Stop, and get down on the ground.</i>

535
01:12:48,213 --> 01:12:50,133
<i>Get down on the ground, now!</i>

536
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:55,395
<i>He's down!
Cease fire!</i>

537
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:09,548
<i>He's still breathing.</i>

538
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:12,230
<i>Stay on him.</i>

539
01:13:15,059 --> 01:13:17,063
Fuck you,
for what you did.

540
01:13:53,406 --> 01:13:55,808
It was Grand Central last night.

541
01:14:01,451 --> 01:14:03,371
Wait here.

542
01:14:17,023 --> 01:14:18,943
Hello?

543
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:15,945
Judy? Judy?!

544
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:17,945
Judy?

545
01:15:22,927 --> 01:15:24,847
Judy, you alright?

546
01:15:59,303 --> 01:16:01,722
They exterminated everyone,
not just the sick.

547
01:16:02,372 --> 01:16:04,311
- Look, there's a ... truck we can take.
- What's...

548
01:16:04,471 --> 01:16:06,810
If we get out of here,
they're goanna kill us, too.

549
01:16:06,827 --> 01:16:09,123
- No, if we get to Cedar Rapids...
- David, can you just stop it?

550
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:14,352
- If we get to Cedar Rapids...
- Stop pretending everything's goanna be okay!

551
01:16:14,648 --> 01:16:16,569
Alright.

552
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,701
For Christ's sake.

553
01:16:25,018 --> 01:16:26,938
I'm sorry.

554
01:16:35,454 --> 01:16:37,374
You want to give up?

555
01:16:38,749 --> 01:16:40,687
If you want to sit here
and die, tell me.

556
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:43,609
And I'll sit here and die with you.

557
01:17:09,052 --> 01:17:11,452
You're goanna go, get that truck.

558
01:18:16,648 --> 01:18:22,409
<i>Viper 2, this is TOC. We're approaching
T-10 minutes. Confirm status.</i>

559

<i> All units, this is TOC.

<i>Countdown procedure initiating.

562
01:20:21,562 --> 01:20:23,483
Oh, shit

563
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:25,842
Honey, it's fine.
It's okay.

564
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:45,222
- David, honey. how's it going there?
- We're goanna get there.

565
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:48,309
Come on.

566
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:53,221
David.

567
01:22:53,723 --> 01:22:56,049
- Goddammit!
- David, come on.

568
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:58,971
Hurry up.

569
01:23:01,703 --> 01:23:03,623
All right. It's okay.

570
01:23:03,834 --> 01:23:06,160
It's got to be in here somewhere,
David. Come on, just keep looking.

571
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:09,280
David, what are you doing?

572
01:23:16,337 --> 01:23:18,258
David!

573
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:20,258
Come on!

574
01:24:56,937 --> 01:24:58,858
Let's get the fuck out of here.

575
01:25:18,518 --> 01:25:21,233
The smallest and straightest road
to Cedar Rapids.

576
01:25:21,234 --> 01:25:23,233
Yeah, perfect.

577
01:25:27,432 --> 01:25:30,314
<i>35... 34... 33... 32...</i>

578
01:25:30,762 --> 01:25:32,683
What happens
when it gets to zero?

579
01:25:33,508 --> 01:25:35,835
<i>T-30 seconds and counting.</i>

580
01:25:36,383 --> 01:25:38,612

01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:50,050
<i>- 19... 18...

584
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:52,971
<i>- 17... 16...

585
01:25:54,669 --> 01:25:58,510

Get down!

593
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,532
