<i>To begin with, of course...</i>

167
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,658

held in the American embassy compound.</i>

their ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>

169

inside the prison that was once our embassy.</i>

180
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,285
TONY:
What happened?

181
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,250
The six of them went out a back exit.

182
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,912
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

183
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,797
Canadians took them in.

184
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,003
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

185
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,295
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.

186
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,680
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

187
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,308
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

188
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,767
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

189
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,397
What about the White House?

190
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,183
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

191
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,397
The Canadians are done.

192
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,377
They say they're bearing
too much risk. Their

193
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:57,259
foreign secretary corners
Vance in Brussels...

194
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,946
...and told him she wants
the six of them out.

195
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,657
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

196
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,538
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book...

197
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,575
...on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.

198
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,914
O'DONNELL: We think it got shredded
before they got in.

199
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,127
But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.

200
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,010
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

201
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,761
And they'll know what they look like.

202
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,298
Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.

203
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,059
- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.

204
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,353
State?

205
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,806
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

206
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,442
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

207
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,648
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

208
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,532
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

209
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,692
State wants the blame,
we'll give it to them.

210
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,494
What does he want me here for?

211
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,452
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

212
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,464
ENGELL:
Okay.

213
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,383
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

214
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,419
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

215
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,964
- Bob?
- Thank you.

216
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,802
All right.

217
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,850
Mark and Cora Lijek.

218
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,434
<i>Twenty-nine and 25. He's</i> a <i>consular
officer, she's an assistant.</i>

219
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,016
<i>Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.</i>

220
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,316
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

221
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,858
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attachÃ© from Idaho.

222
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,822
<i>A bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>

223
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,204
<i>He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.</i>

224
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,952
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

225
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,992
<i>He's smart and a climber.</i>

226
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,251
<i>Speaks Farsi.</i>

227
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,254
<i>He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.</i>

228
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,713
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

229
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,424
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

230
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,180
<i>...oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.</i>

231
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,218
They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.

232
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,183
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

233
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,442
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

234
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,230
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

235
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,739
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

236
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,195
...to the crossing near Tabriz.

237
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,237
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

238
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,949
We wait till the weather clears up...

239
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,491
...then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.

240
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,286
PENDER: We have intelligence
they can ride bicycles.

241
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,422
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

242
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,425
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

243
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,059
O'DONNELL:
Tony.

244
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

245
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,810
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

246
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,351
ENGELL:
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

247
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,894
State is handling the op.

248
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,312
I'm sorry, who is this?

249
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,904
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

250
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,660
Sir, if these people can read or add...

251
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,868
...pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

252
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,073
It's winter. You can't
afford to wait around till

253
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:57,060
spring so it's nice enough
to take a bike ride.

254
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,796
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them...

255
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,925
...you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

256
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,927
- We've explored those options. ENGELL:
They'll never get past airport control.

257
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,635
- Komiteh own the place.
BATES: They could pose as reporters.

258
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,958
- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four.

259
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,601
...visas for American journalists.

260
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

261
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,807
If they're caught with
fake journalist creds,

262
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,833
it's Peter Jennings' head
in a noose in an hour.

263
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,102
North American accents
gives us limited options.

264
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,270
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

265
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,860
What about English teachers
at the international school?

266
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,697
It's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.

267
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,486
BATES:
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

268
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,847
Six Canadians have been
over there inspecting

269
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:36,816
crops, making sure the
kids get enough to eat.

270
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,498
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

271
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,796
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

272
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,628
Those kids are black.

273
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,504
Those are African kids.

274
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,887
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
LAMONT: Are there starving kids in Iran?

275
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so...

276
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,726
LAMONT: What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

277
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,932
Hold on.

278
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,644
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

279
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,897
What's in this picture?

280
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,313
- Tehran.
TONY: Right. What's on the ground?

281
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,153
- Snow.
TONY: Right.

282
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,570
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

You don't wanna need one...

don't do it yourself.

Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

525

He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

526
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,448
Seems he was attached
to star in <i>Zulu Empire...</i>

527
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,825
...which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

528
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,079
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

529
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,161
...because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

530
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,917
They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental...

531
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,373
...so the movie's kaput.

532
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,756
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

533
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,758
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

534
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,170
So the way it looks to me...

535
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,176
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

536
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,132

537

for your toilet paper script...

538

CIA are the good guys.

1330
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,609
The Canadians are the good guys.

LAMONT:
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1332
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:22,735
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

1333
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,410
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1334
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,155
No CIA.

Is that right, Jack?

1336
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:33,794
Involved in what?

1337
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:37,290
We were as surprised as anybody.

1338
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,969
Thank you, Canada.

1340

1341
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,908

a solution to have them</i>

this morning, I'm having breakfast.

1357
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,486
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1358
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,023
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1359
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,658
And I said to her... Do
you know what I said?

1360
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,193
No, what?

1361
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:50,204

Probably wants to fire me himself.

Nobody can know about it.

on January 20, 1981, when all

They spent 444 days in captivity.

1391
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:38,690

complemented efforts of

the six held in Tehran.

friends until Chambers' death in 2001.
