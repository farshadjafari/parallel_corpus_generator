for mob bosses when he was 16.

See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

-There's feds all over the place.
-So what? Where are they gonna go?

-It's in the papers.

-You worry too much.

for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1663
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:58,503
His mind was going in
eight different directions at once.

1664
01:43:00,798 --> 01:43:03,259
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1665

Morrie? Him?

01:43:05,511 --> 01:43:08,389

Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

he talks so much.

I was just stalling for time.

1676
01:43:37,793 --> 01:43:41,881
I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1677
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:46,135

I was going along with the program.

fucking head. I bit him. He's out cold.

I wanted to kill this little fuck.

between himself and the robbery...

1744
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:57,051
but it had nothing to do with me.

1745
01:48:07,564 --> 01:48:10,899
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1746
01:48:12,652 --> 01:48:15,029
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1747
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:19,073
I knew Jimmy.
He had the cash. It was his.

1748
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:22,578
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1749
01:48:23,662 --> 01:48:27,123
It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1750
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:30,127
He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did I care?

1751
01:48:30,295 --> 01:48:32,128
I wasn't asking for anything.

1752
01:48:32,296 --> 01:48:35,925
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1753
01:48:36,467 --> 01:48:40,554
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1754
01:49:02,577 --> 01:49:05,287
When they found Carbone
in the meat truck...

1755
01:49:05,454 --> 01:49:07,122
he was frozen so stiff...

1756
01:49:07,289 --> 01:49:10,417
it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1757
01:49:15,256 --> 01:49:17,382
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1758
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:21,386
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh people...

1759
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:25,099
and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1760
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:27,434
What made Jimmy so happy
that morning...

1761
01:49:27,601 --> 01:49:30,479
was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.

1762
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:33,983
Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1763
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:37,235
He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

1764
01:49:37,444 --> 01:49:41,364
They had a signal set up, so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

We always called each other goodfellas.

01:50:02,679 --> 01:50:04,305

"You'll like this guy. He's all right.

We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1778
01:50:22,114 --> 01:50:26,034
To become a member of a crew,
you've got to be 100% Italian...

1779
01:50:26,202 --> 01:50:29,203
so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1780

It's the highest honor they can give you.

1781
01:50:39,048 --> 01:50:41,550
It means you belong
to a family and a crew.

1782
01:50:41,926 --> 01:50:44,470
It means nobody can fuck around
with you.

1783
01:50:45,012 --> 01:50:47,389
It also means you could
fuck around with anybody...

1784
01:50:47,556 --> 01:50:50,016
just as long as they aren't also a member.

1785
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:53,604
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

01:50:55,774 --> 01:50:57,774

Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

2107
02:15:06,806 --> 02:15:08,640
I don't want to go any place cold.

2108
02:15:09,643 --> 02:15:11,810
You don't have a choice in that matter.

2109
02:15:12,186 --> 02:15:14,729
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

2110
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:18,192
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to--

2111
02:15:18,359 --> 02:15:20,069
He's bronchial, that's why.

2112
02:15:20,237 --> 02:15:22,947
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

2113
02:15:23,114 --> 02:15:25,198
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

2114
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,078
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

2115
02:15:30,037 --> 02:15:31,079
What about them?

2116
02:15:31,247 --> 02:15:33,832
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

2117
02:15:35,085 --> 02:15:37,293
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

2118
02:15:38,171 --> 02:15:39,212
No.

2119
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:43,676
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

2120
02:15:44,051 --> 02:15:48,055
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

2121
02:15:48,222 --> 02:15:51,225
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

2122
02:15:51,725 --> 02:15:53,894
if there's extraordinary circumstances--

2123
02:15:54,061 --> 02:15:56,896
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2124
02:15:58,024 --> 02:15:59,774
I can't leave my parents.

2125
02:16:01,027 --> 02:16:03,237
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

2126
02:16:04,488 --> 02:16:07,490
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

2127
02:16:09,828 --> 02:16:11,494
I can't do it without you.

2128
02:16:11,912 --> 02:16:16,000
So, you do whatever, but...that's it.

2129
02:16:17,543 --> 02:16:20,003
-You need Henry, not me, right?
-That's right.

2130
02:16:20,421 --> 02:16:22,881
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

2131
02:16:23,216 --> 02:16:26,594
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

2132
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:28,345
They want Henry, not me.

2133
02:16:28,512 --> 02:16:31,599
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

2134
02:16:32,516 --> 02:16:35,769
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2135
02:16:35,936 --> 02:16:38,522
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger--

2136
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:41,066
-I don't know anything.
-Don't give me...

2137
02:16:41,234 --> 02:16:42,735
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2138
02:16:42,903 --> 02:16:47,281
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2139
02:16:47,449 --> 02:16:50,783
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

2140
02:16:55,998 --> 02:16:58,083
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2141
02:16:58,251 --> 02:17:01,545
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2142
02:17:02,297 --> 02:17:04,005
He knows it and you know it.

2143
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:07,343
What about the kids and school?

2144
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:09,802
KAREN: Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?

2145
02:17:10,138 --> 02:17:12,556
TUDDY:
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2146
02:17:12,724 --> 02:17:15,183
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2147
02:17:15,352 --> 02:17:18,436
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2148
02:17:19,272 --> 02:17:22,691
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2149
02:17:26,947 --> 02:17:29,573
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2150
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:31,575
HENRY:
It was easy for us to disappear.

2151
02:17:32,118 --> 02:17:34,245
My house
was in my mother-in-law's name.

2152
02:17:34,412 --> 02:17:36,371
My cars were registered to my wife.

2153
02:17:36,539 --> 02:17:40,000
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2154
02:17:40,167 --> 02:17:42,503
I never voted or paid taxes.

2155
02:17:43,087 --> 02:17:47,549
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.

2156
02:17:47,717 --> 02:17:49,635
ATTORNEY:
Do you see him here in this courtroom?

2157
02:17:49,802 --> 02:17:50,843
Yes.

2158
02:17:51,012 --> 02:17:53,096
ATTORNEY:
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2159
02:17:55,683 --> 02:18:00,311
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2160
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:04,524
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2161
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:06,860
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.

2162
02:18:07,444 --> 02:18:09,362
ATTORNEY:
Can you point him out for the jury?

2163
02:18:11,324 --> 02:18:15,411
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2164
02:18:16,745 --> 02:18:18,454
Your Honor, I have a document....

2165
02:18:18,622 --> 02:18:21,040
HENRY:
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2166
02:18:21,876 --> 02:18:23,334
I still love the life.

2167
02:18:23,711 --> 02:18:25,629
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle.

2168
02:18:25,797 --> 02:18:28,048
We had it all, just for the asking.

2169
02:18:28,216 --> 02:18:31,551
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2170
02:18:31,886 --> 02:18:35,055
I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2171
02:18:35,222 --> 02:18:37,474
I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.

2172
02:18:37,641 --> 02:18:41,436
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2173
02:18:41,603 --> 02:18:43,647
ATTORNEY: Objection!
JUDGE: Objection sustained.

2174
02:18:43,815 --> 02:18:47,400
-I know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it.

2175
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:49,444
ATTORNEY: Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence....

2176
02:18:49,611 --> 02:18:51,738
HENRY:
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

2177
02:18:51,906 --> 02:18:55,325
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.

2178
02:18:55,493 --> 02:18:57,995
I'd bet $20,000, $30,000
over a weekend...

2179
02:18:58,163 --> 02:19:02,207
then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2180
02:19:02,375 --> 02:19:03,709
It didn't matter.

2181
02:19:04,252 --> 02:19:09,130
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2182
02:19:09,549 --> 02:19:10,924
We ran everything.

2183
02:19:11,468 --> 02:19:15,763
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2184
02:19:16,013 --> 02:19:19,433
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2185
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:23,061
And now it's all over.

2186
02:19:23,979 --> 02:19:25,439
That's the hardest part.

2187
02:19:26,441 --> 02:19:28,066
Today everything is different.

2188
02:19:28,234 --> 02:19:32,404
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.

2189
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:34,573
Can't even get decent food.

2190
02:19:35,325 --> 02:19:38,451
After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

2191
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,453
and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2192
02:19:41,289 --> 02:19:42,790
I'm an average nobody.

2193
02:19:44,166 --> 02:19:46,959
I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.

2194
02:25:11,494 --> 02:25:13,495
