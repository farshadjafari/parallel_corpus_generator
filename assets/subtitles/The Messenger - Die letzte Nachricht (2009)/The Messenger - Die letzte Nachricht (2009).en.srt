1
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:41,914
Here. Right here. Just wait.

2
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,450
Sorry. I'm late. I...

3
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,256
I ain't dead yet.

4
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,055
It's also for healing.

5
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,229
And celebration, you know?

6
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:15,742
Hey.

7
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,594
Yeah.

8
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:43,640
- Thank you.
- I'd like to sit at that table.

9
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:48,369
- Why?
- I'd like to sit at that table.

10
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:52,777
I know, but they're still eating.
It's fine... -I can see that.

11
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,144
I don't know, I think...

12
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:59,749
I think in, like, a year or so, you know,
I think I'll be ready...

13
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:03,125
...but, you know, I really...
I want to get married.

14
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:06,029
I just... Like, eventually, you know.
I don't...

15
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,459
I just don't want to right now.

16
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:14,797
Plus, we're kind of on this,
like, cruise control, you know?

17
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:18,442
Which is normal. I mean, it happens to
every couple. It happened to us.

18
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,878
Where did you tell him you were going?

19
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,643
- To visit you.
- Yeah, right.

20
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,043
To visit my dad.

21
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,556
- And he believed that?
- I invited him actually, but...

22
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,889
...it turns out he was really, really busy.

23
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,956
You always were a terrific liar.

24
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:43,030
That's not fair.

25
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,881
- I really do love him, you know?
- Well, I do.

26
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,247
He's the right guy for you.

27
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:05,256
I mean, what do you want to do?

28
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:08,988
Are you thinking... Family?
Bachelorhood?

29
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,025
College? Job?

30
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,399
You don't have to worry about me.

31
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,771
The world's my fucking oyster.

32
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,078
Thanks for coming.

33
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,884
I really wanted to see you.

34
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,816
I'm glad you came.

35
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:54,800
Say hi to Alan for me.

36
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,072
I don't think so.

37
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:41,411
Somewhere you gotta be?

38
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:43,780
No, sir.

39
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:49,989
How long has he been waiting?

40
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,631
Seventeen minutes, sir.

41
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,830
Send him in.

42
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:02,966
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

43
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,407
Come in.

44
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,755
Sir, Staff Sergeant Montgomery reports.

45
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,617
At ease. How you getting on, Montgomery?

46
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:25,563
It's going well, sir. -I have
an assignment for you, Montgomery.

47
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:28,795
It so happens that over the few months
you have left on your enlistment...

48
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:33,396
...you will get your chance to render some of
your most valuable service to your country.

49
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:37,136
I'm assigning you to
a Casualty Notification team.

50
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,771
Sir?

51
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,907
Captain Stone will show you the ropes.

52
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,612
He is the expert.

53
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:51,423
But until he does,
I just want to make myself very clear...

54
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:55,222
...that although most of your time will
remain occupied by your other duties...

55
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:59,698
CNO is to be your absolute priority.

56
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,031
This mission is not simply important.

57
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,393
It is sacred.

58
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,531
- Sir, if I may?
- Go ahead.

59
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:11,270
I've never received any grief counseling,
let alone given it.

60
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:14,344
I'm not a religious man, sir.

61
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,439
We're just there for notification.

62
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,576
Not God. Not heaven.

63
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,652
Montgomery...

64
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:26,658
...this job is about character.

65
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:33,089
Now I have had soldiers go out on
notification and break into a stutter.

66
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:37,796
Men so nervous they read from a script
or get the name wrong...

67
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,771
...or the address.

68
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,307
Too many tears.

69
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,367
I need men of solid stature.

70
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:51,577
Now you are a model soldier.
Hell, you're a goddamn hero.

71
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,687
Casualty is a soldier who's
been killed, wounded, missing...

72
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:01,488
...captured, beleaguered or besieged.

73
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,394
Of course, our job's mainly about killed.

74
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:07,360
What you actually need
to do is pretty simple...

75
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,227
...read the guidebook, learn the script...

76
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,204
...stick to the script, fill in the blanks
from the casualty report.

77
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:15,571
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

78
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,809
Can you look at me when I speak with you?

79
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,002
Much appreciated.

80
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,216
Never say stuff like lost
or expired or passed away...

81
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,981
...things people misunderstand.

82
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:32,821
I knew this guy once told this old lady
that her grandson was no longer with us.

83
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:37,192
She thought he had defected to the enemy,
started calling him a traitor.

84
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:44,099
We need to be clear.
Need to say killed or died.

85
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,003
What we don't say
is the deceased or the body.

86
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,565
We call each casualty by name.
We honor them. You with me?

87
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,668
- Yes, sir.
- Then look at me, Sergeant.

88
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:58,748
You do not speak with anybody
other than the next of kin.

89
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,185
No friend, no neighbor,
no coworker or mistress.

90
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,281
Hours of operation are 0600 to 2200 hours.

91
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,622
We don't want to wake anybody
up in the middle of the night...

92
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,720
...though if you ask me, hitting them with
the news at the crack of dawn...

93
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:14,426
...is not exactly a great way
to start their day, breakfastwise.

94
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,535
What do we do if
the next of kin isn't around?

95
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:21,665
We leave. We don't wait. We don't lurk.
We come back later.

96
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:26,144
This is a zero-defect mission.
A pure hit-and-git operation.

97
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,504
Is that it, sir?

98
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,548
One more thing.
You do not touch the NOK.

99
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:39,222
Avoid physical contact
with the next of kin...

100
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:43,661
...unless it's a medical emergency, like if they
were having a heart attack or something.

101
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,193
You're representing the Secretary of the Army,
not Will Montgomery.

102
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,602
So in case you feel like offering a hug
or something, don't.

103
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:54,537
It'll only get you in trouble.

104
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:58,972
I'm not gonna be offering any hugs, sir.

105
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,138
- Is that's it?
- No.

106
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:06,083
These are the rules. It's not the job.

107
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:07,813
The job is about...

108
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,823
...something else.

109
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:14,655
You gotta do it before you can understand.

110
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,754
You a head case?

111
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,101
No, sir.

112
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,299
I surely hope not.

113
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,341
Then that's it. You can go.

114
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,864
Sergeant, one more thing.

115
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:58,666
We make it our business to deliver
the news within 24 hours of positive I D.

116
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,672
The ideal is within four.

117
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,403
We're racing FOX,
CNN, <i>Drudge Report,</i> what-have-you.

118
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:07,537
Not to mention any soldier
with a cell phone or a webcam.

119
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,945
The whole point is we gotta be first.

120
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,506
So, if you're in bed...

121
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:16,419
...or church or the ballet,
this baby stays on.

122
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:19,857
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:26,988
Tried and true.

124
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:31,162
A long battery life too. Can't be beat.

125
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,733
I know what you're thinking.

126
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,506
You're thinking...
"Shit, I'm a goddamn decorated war hero...

127
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,516
with three months left to serve and they
draft me into the Angels of Death squadron.

128
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:47,951
I get a beeper, a canned speech...

129
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:52,458
...and a lunatic commanding officer
to surf a fucking ocean of grief. "

130
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:54,916
Am I right?

131
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:58,521
More or less, sir. Am I right?

132
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:47,737
It's the middle of the fucking night!

133
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,805
Turn that fucking music off!

134
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,397
There's your problem.

135
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,335
Attention to detail, Private!

136
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,146
Read the fucking manual!

137
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:28,017
You have 130-degree heat.
You have sand blasting.

138
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,453
It's baked the hose
right under the housing.

139
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,514
Break the suction.

140
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,859
Every second you're
on the side of the road...

141
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:39,693
...increases your chances of getting shot...

142
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,699
...your boys shot, your boys blown up.

143
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:44,668
No haji armor's gonna protect you.

144
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,968
Plus you're fucking up
a five billion dollar a week operation...

145
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,373
...because you don't have
a 25 cent cooling hose.

146
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,969
So you think ahead.
You have 10 in the back.

147
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,241
You think ahead. You prepare.
You think ahead.

148
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,881
Yeah, well, should be
in the next couple blocks.

149
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:10,562
We should just ask someone.

150
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,688
No.

151
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:16,724
First of all, men don't ask for directions,
much less soldiers.

152
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:22,965
Soldiers on a notification, definitely,
positively do not ask for freaking directions.

153
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:27,545
No GPS. No MapQuest. We navigate.

154
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:31,947
Second, you never wanna park too close.

155
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:36,751
They hear a car park, go to the window,
see two soldiers getting out...

156
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,790
...it's just a minute of torture.

157
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:44,024
Now I should warn you
some of them do have guns.

158
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,993
Knocking is ominous,
but ringing is jarring.

159
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,334
Or worse, sometimes you get one of those
god-awful chirping doorbells...

160
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:56,204
...some singsongy shit throws
you right off your game.

161
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:59,506
<i>Yankee Doodle went to town</i>
<i>A ridin'on a pony</i>

162
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,548
And "Sorry your husband is dead"
doesn't flow. So I knock.

163
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:05,550
I don't really like to say good morning
or good afternoon either.

164
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,745
There ain't nothing good about it.

165
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,312
I used to introduce myself, that's standard,
but now I think it's rude.

166
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,291
It ain't about me. Lose the shades.

167
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,300
We're looking for Mrs. Tina Burrell.
Is she in?

168
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:37,949
Is Leroy in trouble again?
I'm his girlfriend.

169
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:40,645
We need to speak with Mrs. Burrell.

170
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,348
Okay, Come in. Come in.

171
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,564
Please, sit down.

172
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:55,458
I just made some tea.

173
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:58,826
Do you want some?

174
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:02,737
Ma'am, could you please get Mrs. Burrell?

175
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:06,244
Yeah, she's down the block. She just called.
She'll be back in a minute.

176
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,717
I thought you said we don't wait.

177
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,186
If she's not here in 30 seconds,
we're gone.

178
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:20,083
Sit.

179
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,393
I'm Monica. I'm Leroy's girlfriend.

180
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,227
And this is his baby. He's a boy.

181
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:34,296
But he don't know that yet, so don't tell
him because I ain't calling him Junior.

182
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,807
<i>Two cell phones.</i>

183
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:41,279
<i>One was $209.75, and the other...</i>

184
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:42,871
What did he do?

185
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,644
I'm sorry, ma'am. Our orders
are to speak with Mrs. Burrell.

186
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,314
Well, I am too. I mean, I was gonna be.

187
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:53,756
We were supposed to get married, but then
my father got laid off and...

188
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,619
Look, I know Leroy's always saying
the wrong thing, but he's a good man.

189
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,364
Please, just tell me.

190
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,926
<i>I got an envelope</i>
<i>with these sheets of paper.</i>

191
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,938
<i>Could I see those papers, please?</i>

192
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:08,997
We'll be back.

193
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:13,171
<i>You sent her the money and this envelope</i>
<i>came with these two pictures...</i>

194
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:15,941
Sir, tell me.

195
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:24,582
Oh, why? Oh, no,
please, God, no! My, God, why?

196
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:28,184
- What's going...
- I have bad news, Mrs. Burrell.

197
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,196
The Secretary of the Army has asked me to
express his deepest regret...

198
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:34,994
...that your son,
Private First Class Leroy Burrell...

199
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:38,230
No, no, no!
You got to go! You got to go!

200
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:42,832
- I'm very sorry, Mrs. Burrell.
- No. Listen. No!

201
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:46,400
That's my baby. That's my baby.

202
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,413
We can't do this right...

203
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,609
- Your son was killed yesterday...
- Monica... Oh, my God! My house is a mess.

204
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:55,882
- A Casualty Assistance...
- No! Don't you say that about my baby!

205
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,515
Don't you say that about my baby!

206
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,793
- I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- No! Make him go!

207
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:04,830
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you shortly...

208
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:08,128
- To help you arrange for the funeral.
- Tell him to stop saying that!

209
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,847
We left them with the next-door neighbor.

210
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:26,351
- <i>How'd she take it?</i>
- Hard. Very hard.

211
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,353
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Yep.

212
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,083
<i>We'll be there by 1000 hours.</i>

213
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,125
All right, thanks. Good luck.

214
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:36,461
CAO is on the way.

215
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,361
No such thing as a satisfied customer.

216
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:46,963
Ice cream! Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream!

217
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,267
Double whiskey, please.

218
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:52,936
- Hot water and lemon?
- And a glass of ice.

219
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,811
I'm in AA, if you're asking.

220
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:06,684
Been sober three years. Mind you, I never
drank anything stronger than pop.

221
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,160
Of course, my pop would drink
just about anything.

222
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,569
Oh, they tell them to get ready
when their kids deploy...

223
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,006
...but they never really listen, do they?

224
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:29,480
Soldiers go to war
and everyone waves flags and applauds...

225
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:34,884
...look at charts, study strategies,
have "informed opinions. "

226
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:39,584
And then bullets fly and soldiers die
and it's such a shock.

227
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:44,061
Fuck that! What did they think
it was gonna be like, <i>Fear Factor?</i>

228
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:49,159
- Where'd you see action?
- Desert Storm/Desert Shield.

229
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:53,934
Never got a crack at Enduring Freedom
or Iraqi Freedom, much to my chagrin.

230
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,604
Wasn't much of a war, but...

231
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:01,378
I got my baptism too.

232
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:04,914
You weren't the only one getting shot at.

233
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,126
So they say you saved your buddies.

234
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,038
You want to know what I think?

235
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:32,408
I think they ought to show
every goddamn funeral on TV, live.

236
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:36,278
Have the president come
around from time to time and eulogize...

237
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:39,579
...the vice president, get people used to it.

238
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,916
I mean, are we at war or not?

239
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,486
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

240
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:52,327
- Let me know if you guys need anything else.
- Oh, you know it already, Emily.

241
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:01,634
I'd like to strap her on and wear her like
a government-issue gas mask.

242
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:05,165
- I got my sights on her, so don't even go there.
- Roger that.

243
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:11,749
I figure I could play
the sensitivity card.

244
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:14,285
Tell her what my day was like
down in death valley.

245
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:18,119
Then again, sympathy backfires...

246
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,158
...she'll never leave.

247
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:23,922
Trust me, I've been married three times.
Twice to the same woman.

248
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,930
So now you know what the mission is.

249
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:32,095
Yeah.

250
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:35,930
Hey, if you're not cut out for it...

251
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,669
...you're not cut out for it.

252
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:46,307
So you have a girl?

253
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,749
You got to think about it?

254
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,388
Kelly.

255
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,985
We were together
since we were little kids.

256
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:59,189
Then when I was deployed, everything...

257
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,164
She wanted you to commit, you balked...

258
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:05,499
...and the minute you were gone,
Jody plunked his ass down in the La-Z-Boy.

259
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,539
You probably dodged a bullet.

260
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,500
The only reason to get married like that
is the extra pay.

261
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:13,704
Cut them in, then cut them loose.

262
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,914
Of course, they can always get pregnant
and bleed you dry.

263
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,275
It's too easy.

264
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:25,255
I just told her she was free.
I didn't want you knocking on her door.

265
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:34,890
Yeah, well.
Anyway, lot of Shellys out there.

266
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:37,228
Kelly.

267
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,036
You know, up to Vietnam,
they used send a telegram.

268
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:50,377
If it was your wife, what would she want?

269
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,344
<i>Why don't you just kill me,</i>
<i>you son of a bitchl</i>

270
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,651
Yeah! Come on! Come on!

271
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,770
<i>Hey, that was quick.</i>

272
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:01,309
Are you awake?
Just making sure you're on your toes.

273
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:04,082
- <i>Is this a joke, sir?</i>
- No, no. I just...

274
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:10,087
You know, since I stopped drinking,
I stay up nights...

275
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:12,928
...especially after notifying someone.

276
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:20,971
<i>So you think you might stay on</i>
<i>after your enlistment's up?</i>

277
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,028
<i>I mean...</i>

278
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,734
...hell, you...

279
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:28,877
What's your e-mail anyway? Do you I M?

280
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:31,040
<i>I don't have a computer.</i>

281
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:34,313
Really? How does that work?

282
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,180
Hey, you're funny.

283
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:41,454
- <i>What?</i>
- You calling my beeper.

284
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:44,860
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Oh, shit.</i>

285
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,125
<i>Get ready. I'll meet you on post.</i>

286
00:24:58,076 --> 00:24:59,566
What's going on?

287
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:01,670
You gotta get out of here.

288
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:08,981
Don't look at me like that. I gotta go,
so you gotta go. Come on, let's go.

289
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,324
I don't get it. You married or something?

290
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:19,689
No, no. I just got... work.

291
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:22,632
Work? In the middle of the night
all of a sudden?

292
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,795
What the do you do? Deliver babies?

293
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:34,837
Dale Martin. Dale Martin. Dale. Dale.

294
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,044
Specialist Eric Martin, killed in action...

295
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:41,917
- I got it covered.
- I'm doing this one.

296
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:44,013
...in southern Iraq...
- It's okay. I'll do it.

297
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,683
I'm assigned to do something,
I'm going to do it, sir.

298
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:50,953
Specialist Eric Martin, southern Iraq.

299
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,931
Well, okay. It's a man this time.

300
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,663
So?

301
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:04,637
Men try harder to keep it together.
They're also the ones that can hurt you.

302
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,644
<i>You cannot be a burden to taxpayersl</i>

303
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,647
- <i>You're not entitled to welfare...</i>
- I'm doing this.

304
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:12,309
<i>... Assistance that comes</i>
<i>in any way out of my pocket.</i>

305
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:14,409
Well, then, reach down in your pants...

306
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:17,717
...grab a double handful of balls
and do it right.

307
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,417
<i>Freeloader, got itl You can come here</i>
<i>if you can invest here...</i>

308
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:23,017
<i>around, let's say, 50 times</i>
<i>the current minimum wage.</i>

309
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:25,086
<i>If you can do that, ha, come!</i>

310
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:08,299
Let's go.

311
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:11,936
Let's go.

312
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:20,915
Excuse me?

313
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,151
Mr. Martin?

314
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:26,424
Oh, shit!

315
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,584
Dale Martin?

316
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:32,890
The Secretary of the Army
has asked me to express his deep regret...

317
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:37,868
...that your son, Specialist Eric Martin,
was killed in action yesterday...

318
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:40,803
...in southern Iraq by sniper fire.

319
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:43,864
You will receive a more complete report
as soon as possible, sir.

320
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:48,572
What we can tell you right now is that his
platoon came under sniper fire...

321
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:52,242
...and it was an instant death.

322
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,443
I'm so sorry.

323
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,422
Look at that tree.

324
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,456
I said look at that fucking tree.

325
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,726
It's the same age as my son.

326
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:20,539
"If I don't go,
who's gonna go in place of me?"

327
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:22,102
That's what he said.

328
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,585
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you in four hours...

329
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:30,951
- Fucking bastards!
- Will notify you in...

330
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:35,125
Will notify you in four hours.

331
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:37,627
Is there a neighbor
or a friend or a family member...

332
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,358
- You fucking idiot!
- That can come and help you in your trying time?

333
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,759
Why aren't you there?

334
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,528
Why aren't you dead?

335
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,576
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Why aren't you there now?

336
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:56,839
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking cowards.

337
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:59,850
- Let's go.
- I don't care if you're fucking sorry!

338
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:01,579
We're done here.

339
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:03,814
Don't you fucking say you're sorry to me.

340
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:08,586
You want to tell his mother?

341
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,128
Are you gonna tell his mother?

342
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:13,426
He's fucking 20 years old!

343
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,394
Keep walking.

344
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:21,665
- You fucking coward!
- Keep walking.

345
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,867
- I said...
- I don't fucking care!

346
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:27,639
Sergeant,
he touches you again, I'll handle it.

347
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:30,272
What? Fucking handle what?

348
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,982
You'll fucking handle what?

349
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,778
You fucking cowards!

350
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:11,847
Well, I guess one way or another
we're all God's children.

351
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:19,492
It's all fortune cookies to me, sir.

352
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:35,336
I'm not really happy with these drops.

353
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:39,042
I'm gonna prescribe something else.

354
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:45,116
What's the doctor saying about the leg?

355
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,523
It's getting better. Though but I'm sort
of rooting for the eye.

356
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:51,452
It's not a race.

357
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,325
Polytrauma takes a lot of patience.

358
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,699
The body parts are literally
on different schedules.

359
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:04,368
"And all the king's horses
and all the king's men... " How does it go?

360
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:09,874
"Couldn't put Humpty back together again. "

361
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,089
<i>Kelly's phone. This is Alan.</i>

362
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:35,233
<i>Answer off.</i>

363
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,885
Shit.

364
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,060
- Son of a bitch.
- <i>... For sentencing tomorrow.</i>

365
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:06,160
<i>We'll keep you posted.</i>
<i>And the State Supreme Court...</i>

366
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:16,039
Don't say anything. I'll do the talking.

367
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:23,947
Sergeant.

368
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,984
- License and registration.
- What'd I do?

369
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:30,384
You went through a red light
about a half a mile back.

370
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:33,397
- It was yellow.
- It was red when he went through it.

371
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,865
- It's an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

372
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:38,994
A soldier died.
We're going to notify the widow.

373
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:42,205
- That's not an emergency.
- It's about timing.

374
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,764
You know that.

375
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:46,606
Yeah, well, you get into a wreck
on your way to a notification...

376
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:49,647
...you kill somebody, you get yourself killed,
how's that gonna feel?

377
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:51,705
That's a jackass move.

378
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,717
- Can you believe this shit?
- Excuse me?

379
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,412
No, he's right. He's right.

380
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,617
I don't want to do this anyway.

381
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,555
You want to do it?

382
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:14,495
Go to this address,
her name is Olivia Pitterson.

383
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:17,405
Knock on her door
and break her little heart.

384
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:20,734
Fuck it.
Well, let's pretend it didn't happen.

385
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:25,647
Let her find out that he got blown up
from some kid at the local news desk.

386
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:29,346
Let him put her on hold, 'cause you don't
give a fuck about her, do you?

387
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:33,619
No. No! You are just doing your job.

388
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,492
Get the hell out of here.

389
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:22,162
- All right. Hey!
- Yeah, me too.

390
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,208
Last one's is ready!

391
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,368
Pretty high up, isn't it, huh?

392
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:43,256
Could be worse.

393
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,353
It could be Christmas.

394
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,335
Jesus.

395
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:07,415
Mrs. Pitterson? Mrs. Pitterson.

396
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,811
Are you Mrs. Pitterson?

397
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:15,623
How did it happen?

398
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:20,292
Did anyone talk with you already, ma'am?

399
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,062
How did he die?

400
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:30,140
He was killed in action yesterday
in the city of Mosul.

401
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,233
That's all the information
we have now, ma'am.

402
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,111
But the Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy to you...

403
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:38,945
There's no need.

404
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,718
But...

405
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:53,695
I would ask you in, but my little boy...

406
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:58,800
Am I supposed to call Phil's parents?

407
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,866
Not unless you want to, ma'am.

408
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:06,741
Your husband's DD-93 has you
listed as the primary NOK...

409
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,143
...and them as secondary.

410
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:13,173
They moved to Florida.
Is that still accurate?

411
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:14,445
Yes.

412
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:20,182
A local notification team
has been alerted...

413
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:24,058
...and they're waiting for us
to give them the go-ahead.

414
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:28,497
Okay, thanks a lot. Good-bye.

415
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:32,002
The Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you shortly...

416
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,800
...to help make arrangements for the funeral.

417
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,738
Okay. Thanks.

418
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:40,137
Good-bye.

419
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:46,573
Ma'am, would you like us
to notify your child?

420
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,514
What?

421
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:55,750
No, no. I can tell my little boy.

422
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:01,156
Okay, good-bye.
I know this can't be easy for you.

423
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,873
- If you have any further questions, just...
- No. No. No, thanks.

424
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:32,422
Sergeant!

425
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:43,497
"I know this can't be easy for you. "
Can you believe that?

426
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:45,799
That's a first.

427
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:51,976
She's banging someone.
You see the shirt she was hanging?

428
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:59,790
Her husband dies 10,000 miles away,
she's got a man on the clothesline already.

429
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:08,763
Hey, we getting in this vehicle
sometime today?

430
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:12,360
We walk into these people's lives,
we don't know shit.

431
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:13,426
Trust me.

432
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,062
You don't want to know.

433
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:20,437
Come on.

434
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:28,781
From now on we take the silver bullet.
Your wheels are crap.

435
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,160
Why are you giving me pancakes?

436
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:45,702
'Cause you're my baby and I love you.

437
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:48,705
What's wrong?

438
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:17,092
You going to pretend you don't have one?

439
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:20,698
I know you have her picture.

440
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:23,138
I'm willing to bet the next round on it.

441
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:32,873
What have we here?

442
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:35,741
Nice.

443
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,012
You can afford the next round.

444
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,254
Nice.

445
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:50,027
Very nice. Table grade.

446
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,729
I could slop her up with a biscuit.

447
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:55,238
Yeah, well, she has
a very serious boyfriend.

448
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:59,675
No, I don't buy it. Not this girl.
There's nothing serious about her.

449
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:05,073
She's having a ball down in Nowheresville
while you pine for her.

450
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,141
You still got her number?

451
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:17,050
Oh, wait. Hey, hey.

452
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:18,425
Come here.

453
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:21,692
Sit. Will you sit?

454
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,963
Listen, I thought we had
a great time the other night.

455
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:31,497
You were amazing, as was I...

456
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:36,479
...and I'm sorry I had to go,
but tonight's another night.

457
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,149
I'm pregnant.

458
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,419
I'm just fucking with you.

459
00:40:46,324 --> 00:40:48,952
- Have a good life.
- A good life.

460
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:50,891
Hey, you got my hopes up.

461
00:40:57,602 --> 00:41:02,130
A glass of ice, hot water, lemon.

462
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:03,696
Paid in full.

463
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:09,169
I think I'm gonna head out.

464
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:12,538
Where you going?

465
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:18,021
- I'm gonna go home.
- What for? Internet porn?

466
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,789
Come on, you don't even have a computer.

467
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:22,985
What...

468
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:26,962
I was bullshitting. No, stay.

469
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,161
Forget women.
We'll talk about something else, right?

470
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:36,697
Sleep when you're dead.

471
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,366
What's your deal?

472
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,707
Your folks around?

473
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:51,780
My father's gone.

474
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,218
My mom's a... Nut.

475
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,793
I haven't seen her in years.

476
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:02,364
Another lost child
looking for family, huh?

477
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:04,791
I guess so.

478
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:10,663
Why did you join?

479
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:13,767
- A dare.
- A dare?

480
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:15,335
Why are you still here?

481
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:18,905
Well, they offered me a commission
and no one dared me to leave.

482
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,855
And I dare you to stay.

483
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:36,799
Hey, we're not gonna lie to you... Iraq,
Afghanistan... wherever we go next, hostile.

484
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,059
Hey, it's crazy, but it's real.

485
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:43,436
Hey, the army's hard work. Fighting terrorists,
rebuilding countries, saving lives.

486
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:44,997
And risking our lives?

487
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:46,976
I don't have to remind you
how many Americans lost their lives...

488
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:48,841
...just showing up for work
one morning in September, do I?

489
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,778
- That's right.
- No, I didn't think so.

490
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:52,873
Shoot, there's risk in the army,
there's risk in life.

491
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,850
But we're talking about rewards here...

492
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,513
...and we're talking about
a feeling that you can get...

493
00:42:57,588 --> 00:43:01,752
...but not from flinging hot dogs at a ball game
or bagging groceries at a supermarket.

494
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:04,386
We're talking about honor and discipline.

495
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:06,555
- Self-respect.
- Thank you.

496
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,189
I just wanna fuck some shit up.

497
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:10,734
- That does come with the job sometimes.
- Oh, come on.

498
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:12,701
You have any sort of skills
you want to bring to the army?

499
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,328
Leave them alone.
They're just kids.

500
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:16,600
Oh, ma'am, these young men
want to serve their country.

501
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:19,336
- They're here by their free will.
- Oh, do you want to take a look?

502
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,571
- You want to take a look at this, see?
- Okay, ma'am...

503
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:23,580
- You want to guess what it's for?
- Ma'am...

504
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:26,242
There's a sticker on my husband's coffin
that says "remains unviewable. "

505
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:28,285
- Ma'am, we're very sorry...
- Nice big tall boys like you.

506
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:30,820
- And what's left could fit in a shoe box.
- I understand you're upset.

507
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:33,118
- Why don't you calm down?
- Ma'am, why don't you take your son home...

508
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,681
Why don't you take your son home
and calm down?

509
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,820
Why don't you go home? In fact, why
doesn't everybody just go home?

510
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,830
- That's right go home!
- We're all in this together.

511
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:43,628
- Sergeant. Take a walk.
- Why doesn't everybody just go home?

512
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:45,635
- Yes, sir.
- You guys know where to find us.

513
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:47,796
- What are you looking at? Just go home!
- You okay?

514
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:49,795
Yeah.

515
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:53,605
- Do you need anything?
- What? No, thank you.

516
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,536
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Come on.

517
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:05,983
- Come on.
- I hate this suit!

518
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:09,083
Pick it up.
I've asked you to pick that up.

519
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,957
Pick it up. Now.

520
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:15,054
Do not do that.

521
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,281
I was getting a prescription...

522
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:35,975
...at the mall.

523
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:39,952
And that's why I was at the mall.

524
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:43,257
I have this eye...

525
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:47,830
I gotta get... Take drops... For...

526
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:54,267
It's okay now? Is it okay now?

527
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:57,299
Yeah.

528
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:06,212
Gets dry. It's kinda... Spotty.

529
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:42,777
You'll need a new transmission soon.

530
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,478
Can I pay you something?

531
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:46,818
No.

532
00:45:50,227 --> 00:45:52,957
I should get a new car
at some point, but...

533
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:57,590
...it just feels wrong,
you know, with the new money.

534
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:02,728
Do you play?

535
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:06,075
No.

536
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:07,770
I work at Lock and Keep.

537
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,976
It's a storage space
on Third Street and Battalion.

538
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:17,511
You know, sometimes people
leave things behind. Nice things.

539
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:20,648
A new mattress, coffee table...

540
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:23,659
...framed pictures of strangers.

541
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:32,297
I'm gonna get going.

542
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:36,296
Thanks for your help.

543
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:38,773
Yeah. Get a new transmission.

544
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:39,935
Soon.

545
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:42,273
Seriously.

546
00:46:45,716 --> 00:46:47,206
Thanks for the ride.

547
00:46:54,558 --> 00:46:56,219
Thanks. Bye.

548
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,132
That's it! Yeah, come on!

549
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:28,219
Yeah!

550
00:47:31,795 --> 00:47:33,626
That's not what I said.

551
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:35,894
But you are trying to fuck her,
aren't you?

552
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:39,129
I'm not trying anything, sir.
I fixed her car.

553
00:47:39,937 --> 00:47:43,429
You saw the shirt.
She's got someone.

554
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:44,633
Who?

555
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,374
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

556
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:53,478
Jesus, why is it always the quiet ones?

557
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:57,518
Where are your morals, hero?

558
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:02,788
It's just too easy. You bring her her husband's
death and then you try to fuck her.

559
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:09,230
And by the way, if she's into you,
she's into some really weird twists.

560
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,997
She's a real head case.
You've been warned.

561
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,698
Thank you, sir.
I will make a note of that.

562
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:26,974
I bet her husband couldn't wait to get
away from her and back in theater.

563
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,485
<i>For Central, a stalled</i>
<i>car blocking the middle lane.</i>

564
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:31,418
<i>Traffic slowing down from...</i>

565
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:37,556
We're here to speak with Mrs. Galindo.

566
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:42,595
What, this some kind of joke?

567
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:46,728
- No, sir.
- There's no Mrs. Galindo here.

568
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:50,535
- Marla Galindo? Are you saying she moved or...
- Hold it. Marla!

569
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:54,467
Marla!

570
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:02,885
- Marla!
- What?

571
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:04,978
- I'm so tired of this shit from you.
- What? What did I do?

572
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:08,115
There are a couple of soldiers downstairs.
They're asking for a Mrs. Galindo.

573
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:10,683
Dad, we were gonna, but I...

574
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:12,888
Tell me what? What are you talking about?

575
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:15,124
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's going on?

576
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:16,689
We were gonna tell you, but I...

577
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:19,201
I knew how you felt and there
was just so little time before...

578
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,295
- What, you married that little greaseball?
- Please, don't call him that!

579
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:23,306
- You always do that!
- Mrs. Galindo...

580
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:25,308
Hold it! I'm dealing with
some family stuff here!

581
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:27,503
- Could you step outside?
- Just let them say what they need to say!

582
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:29,944
- I have bad news for you, Mrs. Galindo.
- Just leave us for a second?

583
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:34,212
Your husband, Corporal Mario Galindo,
was killed last night in Iraq...

584
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:37,584
...by an improvised explosive device.

585
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:41,989
The Secretary of the Army has asked me
to express his deepest sympathy to you.

586
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:47,759
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you in the next few hours.

587
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:02,537
- We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- All right, all right.

588
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:12,448
Daddy.

589
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:15,922
- I'm so sorry.
- I know. I know.

590
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:19,827
I was gonna tell you. I'm... I'm...

591
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:24,399
Here's a good one! Here's a good one!

592
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:28,302
So this tribal chief, he's this
old-looking guy, I figured he's around 50.

593
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:30,363
Maybe older. Maybe 60.

594
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,274
His face is all sagging and fucking gray.

595
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:35,039
He's got a bunch of teeth missing.

596
00:50:35,112 --> 00:50:36,739
The guy's got fucking scurvy.

597
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:39,044
All kinds of, you know, desert shit.

598
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:41,414
We called him Haji-Wan Kenobi.

599
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:44,420
So he tells me he's not used to making
deals like this with a kid.

600
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:46,422
So I tell him, "Hey, man, I'm 28."

601
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,424
Twenty-nine next month.

602
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:51,427
Yeah, I'm no kid, gramps.
But then, so, the chief says...

603
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:54,555
"Twenty-eight?
You can't be 28. You're a beautiful man.

604
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:56,792
You must be 20, 21."

605
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:01,634
I'm thinking, what is he talking about?
What is this? What is this, he likes me?

606
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:05,266
He wants to get in my pants? But the guy,
he's getting all depressed.

607
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:08,470
He starts saying, " This country's shit.
This country's cursed. "

608
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,775
I try to tell him,
"Hey, man, it ain't that bad...

609
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:13,373
...since we came in
and liberated your sandy asses. "

610
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,645
And then he goes...
And then he goes, " Not that bad?

611
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,017
Look at me. I'm 27!"

612
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:22,749
It's all the goat fucking, man!

613
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:26,455
The poor asshole. He got one here,
a couple here, one went through his chest.

614
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,794
You could almost hear the lungs
deflate, like, swoosh.

615
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:30,959
One of his own men did it.

616
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:34,034
Anyway, he was a funny guy.

617
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:37,806
Haji-Wan Kenobi.

618
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,433
I liked him.

619
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:46,446
What's going on?
What is this? A funeral all of a sudden?

620
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,780
I'll be right back.

621
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:18,637
You okay?

622
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:21,741
Yeah, sure.

623
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:24,447
Night. Good night, guys. See you Monday.

624
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:26,250
See you Monday.

625
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:36,692
It's like coming back from another planet.

626
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,497
What are you talking about, man?

627
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:43,501
I'm fine.

628
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:46,104
I'm fine.

629
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:50,103
I'm home, baby.

630
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:56,886
I'm fucking home, sweet home.

631
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:03,991
Every American generation
has to have a war, you know.

632
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:08,998
We just need it. Because we gotta use up
our weapons, so we can make more. Easy.

633
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:12,763
And we gotta take warriors through wars
so they can command the next batch.

634
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:14,463
Nothing wrong with that.

635
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:18,167
Hey, Sergeant.
Ladies, this is the guy I told you about.

636
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:21,439
Will, this is Claire and Laura.

637
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:23,446
- It's Lara.
- Hey, baby.

638
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:25,675
- Lara. I'm sorry.
- No.

639
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:27,808
- Nice to meet you, Will.
- I'm not sure I can.

640
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:30,012
Yeah, likewise, Lara.

641
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:32,578
- Are you coming in?
- Yeah, in a minute.

642
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:34,783
- I'm buying.
- I'll be in.

643
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:37,053
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Ladies.

644
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:39,595
Everybody's all fucking concerned.

645
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,595
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

646
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:50,729
Ready, aim, fire!

647
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:53,705
Ready, aim...

648
00:53:53,777 --> 00:53:56,109
...fire! Ready.

649
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:58,739
Present arms.

650
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:56,436
Excuse me.

651
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:37,445
Are you Angel Vasquez?

652
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,073
Do you speak English?

653
00:55:41,985 --> 00:55:43,509
No.

654
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:48,524
Mr. Vasquez, the Secretary of the Army
has asked me to extend his deepest regret...

655
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:52,562
...that your daughter, Patricia...

656
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:55,621
was killed in a helicopter crash...

657
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:59,567
...at 7:00 a.m. our time
in the Anbar province of Iraq.

658
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:03,595
You will be further advised
as more information becomes available.

659
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:11,880
The Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy to you...

660
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:15,384
...and your family in your tragic loss.

661
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,492
He's asking if we're sure about it.

662
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:34,462
Positive identification
has been made, sir.

663
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:54,786
He's saying, "It can't be. "

664
00:56:57,594 --> 00:56:59,084
I'm very sorry, sir.

665
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:37,658
<i>Hey, it's Kelly.</i>

666
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:41,927
<i>I'm sorry I sent that invitation.</i>

667
00:57:42,606 --> 00:57:45,074
<i>That was really... That was really dumb.</i>

668
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:48,475
<i>You know, I wanted us to be able...</i>

669
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:51,241
<i>I don't know. I hope you're not mad, okay?</i>

670
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:55,341
<i>You didn't RSVP, so...</i>

671
00:57:57,454 --> 00:58:01,823
<i>I guess, you know,</i>
<i>I was scared to tell you and...</i>

672
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:03,985
<i>I don't know, there's, like,</i>
<i>all this stress.</i>

673
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,723
<i>You know, I don't even want</i>
<i>this stupid party anyways, and his parents...</i>

674
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:13,665
<i>Sorry, it's, like,</i>
<i>not even your problem.</i>

675
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:16,862
<i>I'm crazy, I know.</i>

676
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,510
<i>Alan and I got in a big fight</i>
<i>about it and...</i>

677
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:24,606
<i>Don't come, okay?</i>

678
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:29,775
<i>Just forget the invitation</i>
<i>and forget me. Just...</i>

679
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:31,480
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

680
00:59:15,065 --> 00:59:16,259
Matt?

681
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:21,233
Hey, pal.

682
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:25,433
I bet the other kid
got it pretty good, huh?

683
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:29,368
I brought you this.

684
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,471
It was my unit's flag.

685
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:35,211
I already have two.

686
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:38,618
Matt, say thanks.

687
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:40,155
Thanks.

688
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:49,255
Thanks a lot.

689
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:54,127
You know, flags and casseroles,
I can't seem to get enough of them.

690
00:59:57,073 --> 01:00:00,668
If I can... Do anything...

691
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:03,938
I know where to find you.

692
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:08,744
Anyway, we're leaving town.

693
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:14,312
Where you going?

694
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,621
I haven't decided. You know, it's funny.

695
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:18,718
We always had to move
wherever the army sent us...

696
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:21,628
...and now I don't know where to go.

697
01:00:21,698 --> 01:00:27,432
If you need help with any, you know,
packing boxes or putting things in boxes...

698
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:31,870
You know, I can pack up
this house in a day and unpack it in two.

699
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:34,172
Plenty of practice.

700
01:00:40,717 --> 01:00:43,277
- Thanks for the flag.
- Sure.

701
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:47,221
We were thinking about
getting some pizza.

702
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,799
- Can I watch TV?
- After you finish your broccoli.

703
01:01:03,573 --> 01:01:06,007
Mom, there's no broccoli.

704
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:16,243
Oh, I must've left it on the microwave.

705
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,685
I should probably go...

706
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:21,815
...but thank you... For the pizza.

707
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:24,621
And it was nice
hangin' with you, Matt.

708
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:28,157
How come he doesn't
have to eat his broccoli?

709
01:01:32,202 --> 01:01:34,170
I could eat broccoli.

710
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:39,064
I'm not eating mine.

711
01:01:40,677 --> 01:01:42,304
Then I'll have yours.

712
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:47,109
<i>Stain Spray-Away, the only</i>
<i>instant stain remover...</i>

713
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:50,414
<i>that can spray away stains</i>
<i>anywhere stains can happen.</i>

714
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:53,479
<i>Worry-free Oxy-clean</i>
<i>uses the power of oxygen.</i>

715
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:56,116
<i>It gently lifts stains out</i>
<i>without rubbing and scrubbing.</i>

716
01:01:56,192 --> 01:01:58,786
<i>You can't avoid stains</i>
<i>like coffee and ketchup...</i>

717
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,456
<i>It's like you never got them</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

718
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,351
Because Friday's my last day...

719
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:37,161
I thought that you could
take some of this stuff, you know?

720
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:39,633
It's just left here,
and it seems such a waste.

721
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:07,355
Anybody looking at us right now...

722
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,456
would say that you're a lowlife
trying to take advantage of my grief...

723
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:14,737
...and that I'm a slut
and that I'm not really grieving.

724
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:27,340
You ever lose anybody?

725
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,648
Yeah.

726
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:36,490
Friends, over there.

727
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:40,561
My father during peacetime.

728
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,723
A drunk driver.

729
01:03:43,933 --> 01:03:45,457
Did they catch him?

730
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:49,301
No, my father was the drunk driver.

731
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:55,236
My mom woke me up
in the middle of the night...

732
01:03:55,311 --> 01:04:00,374
...and she said his brakes failed.

733
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,111
Never saw her cry.

734
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:10,349
But it made me
want to be a mechanic by age 10.

735
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:21,695
So your mom notified you.

736
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:53,591
Do you want to dance?

737
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:56,798
There's no music.

738
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:38,243
I'm gonna go get a shower.

739
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:42,981
But why?

740
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:46,282
'Cause I smell.

741
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,664
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
Do you want one?

742
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:16,745
- Do you want a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

743
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:17,210
I can't. I'm sorry.

744
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:19,376
It's okay.

745
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:31,426
When Phil reenlisted for a third tour...

746
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:35,964
...it was like he needed to go.

747
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,291
Staying home was no longer an option.

748
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:45,597
I was relieved to see him go.

749
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:51,677
I missed him, but I didn't...

750
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:55,775
I didn't miss the guy that just left...

751
01:07:57,387 --> 01:08:00,914
...because I missed the man
he was a long time ago.

752
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:10,296
One morning, I opened the closet...

753
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:13,159
...and a shirt fell out...

754
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,036
...and I smelled it.

755
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:21,810
And it smelled awful.

756
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:27,639
It smelled horrible.

757
01:08:29,886 --> 01:08:35,847
Not of, like, another woman
or booze or cigarettes or...

758
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,227
It smelled of rage...

759
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:44,530
...and fear.

760
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:55,505
It smelled of the man
that he had become over there, you know?

761
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:02,610
And he didn't treat me or his little boy
very good when he was at home.

762
01:09:03,853 --> 01:09:07,311
So in a way, in my mind,
it was like he was dead already.

763
01:09:08,024 --> 01:09:12,654
Anyway, I washed the shirt...

764
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:17,190
...and then you came.

765
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:49,355
I loved him once.

766
01:09:56,205 --> 01:10:00,437
And it's weird because now he's dead.

767
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:06,070
I just... I love him again.

768
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:12,387
But more for my little boy.

769
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:19,020
I'm sorry. I should never
have brought you here.

770
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:22,462
God, I'm sorry.

771
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:26,796
Don't be.

772
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:36,576
And it's not that I don't want to. I just...

773
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:41,107
I know. Me too.

774
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:58,131
I'm gonna go and get Matt
and pick him up early.

775
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:02,635
He loves that,
and the other kids go green with envy.

776
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,031
Okay.

777
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:14,880
Okay.

778
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:34,030
Is it okay if I...

779
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:38,971
...stay here for a few minutes?

780
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:45,337
Sure.

781
01:11:45,414 --> 01:11:49,874
Just slam the door real hard.
The lock's kinda funky.

782
01:11:49,952 --> 01:11:51,044
Okay.

783
01:11:52,788 --> 01:11:53,812
Thanks.

784
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:46,002
A soldier dies in a black-op mission
someplace we never admitted being...

785
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:48,067
...the army calls his death an accident.

786
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:50,908
Why? To protect the next one.

787
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:56,079
Another soldier dies slipping into
a ditch, we call it a combat death...

788
01:12:56,152 --> 01:12:58,882
...just to give it a meaning.

789
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:00,819
What's your point?

790
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,084
My point?

791
01:13:03,526 --> 01:13:05,824
My point is that sometimes the army...

792
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:09,456
...has to be concerned
with something bigger than the truth.

793
01:13:09,532 --> 01:13:12,092
And it's not that
they don't care about you.

794
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:16,036
On the contrary, there is not a family
on God's green Earth...

795
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:18,733
...that takes better care of you
than the US Army.

796
01:13:18,808 --> 01:13:20,070
Really?

797
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,238
Really.

798
01:13:24,013 --> 01:13:26,675
Civilian life's for people
who ain't seen shit.

799
01:13:26,749 --> 01:13:28,580
It's too late for you.

800
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:32,246
You've already seen the shit.
You can't unsee it anymore.

801
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:37,486
You can't be an insurance salesman now,
brother. It's too fucking late.

802
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:40,595
How's that beautiful garden?

803
01:13:40,663 --> 01:13:43,427
Oh, it's doing well.
It's his pride and joy.

804
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:45,694
Oh, yes. He must have you working on it.

805
01:13:45,768 --> 01:13:47,759
The size of those strawberries.

806
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:50,601
I'll see you, Ralph.
Good-bye, Mrs. Flanigan.

807
01:13:50,673 --> 01:13:52,163
Good-bye, now.

808
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:55,876
Ralph Flanigan?

809
01:13:57,213 --> 01:13:58,703
Do I know you?

810
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:01,978
You're Walton Flanigan's father?

811
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:03,279
Yes?

812
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,191
Oh, God!

813
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:19,933
Oh, my God, what's wrong? Ralph?

814
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:21,196
Ralph?

815
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,603
- Ralph?
- Oh, God.

816
01:14:26,408 --> 01:14:28,774
- Ma'am...
- No.

817
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:30,835
- No.
- Talk to me, sweetheart.

818
01:14:32,982 --> 01:14:37,112
The Secretary of the Army
has asked me to express...

819
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:41,350
...his deep regret that your son,
Walton Flanigan...

820
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:44,051
...died yesterday in Iraq.

821
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:47,721
He... No.

822
01:14:47,797 --> 01:14:52,825
The Secretary of the Army
extends his deepest sympathy...

823
01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:56,998
...to you and your family
in your tragic loss.

824
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:07,609
No.

825
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:16,254
A Casualty Assistance Officer
will contact you within a few hours.

826
01:15:16,325 --> 01:15:20,659
Do you need anything? Do you need a ride?
Do you want us to call someone?

827
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:24,688
- No.
- I'm so sorry, ma'am.

828
01:15:26,302 --> 01:15:28,361
I'm so sorry, sir.

829
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:34,298
Where'd they go?

830
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:36,634
They took off.

831
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:47,746
- What?
- What'd I tell you from day one?

832
01:15:47,823 --> 01:15:51,623
You do not touch the NOK.
You gotta wake the fuck up.

833
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:53,184
You're not in high school.

834
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:56,197
You're not in a fucking rock band.
You're in the army.

835
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:59,530
Yeah, I know. I know I'm in the army.
I gave blood to the army.

836
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:04,137
I got blown up in a firefight
that lasted longer than your entire war.

837
01:16:04,206 --> 01:16:08,336
I didn't sunbathe in Kuwait
with the rest of the POG's. I fought!

838
01:16:17,386 --> 01:16:21,254
That was not your job
and you did not follow procedure.

839
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:26,750
Fuck procedure, Tony.
They're human beings.

840
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:30,155
They're just people.

841
01:16:31,433 --> 01:16:33,128
They're not like you.

842
01:17:33,996 --> 01:17:35,054
Get in.

843
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:42,902
It's gonna take you a week
at this rate. Get in.

844
01:17:49,111 --> 01:17:51,875
Hey, guess what? I already let it go.

845
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:01,022
Hey, stubborn, get in the fucking car!

846
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:14,797
Thanks.

847
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:28,040
Dorsett thinks you need some time away.
Clear your head.

848
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,176
He told me to look after you.

849
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:31,243
<i>Yeah...</i>

850
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,810
I don't need anything.

851
01:18:32,888 --> 01:18:34,879
<i>You walked home. You need it.</i>

852
01:18:34,957 --> 01:18:37,858
<i>We're off till Tuesday.</i>
<i>I got everything planned out.</i>

853
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:42,522
Just bring your bathing suit and your ACU's
and the girls are totally into it.

854
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:45,032
<i>What girls? Into what?</i>

855
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,967
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>They won't go if it's just me.</i>

856
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:52,400
<i>Milk in the bottle</i>
<i>Milk in the bottle</i>

857
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:55,500
<i>Well, that sounds like...</i>
<i>That sounds really good.</i>

858
01:18:55,577 --> 01:18:57,101
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

859
01:18:58,647 --> 01:19:02,515
<i>Hey, come on. You're my buddy, right?</i>

860
01:19:02,584 --> 01:19:04,814
<i>I haven't had any in decades.</i>

861
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:07,321
Okay, so don't make me beg, just...

862
01:19:07,389 --> 01:19:10,620
I need to get laid and you do too, right?

863
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,819
Can we take my car?

864
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:17,599
I'll let you choose the girl.
How's that?

865
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:25,570
You sure your step dad
ain't gonna show up?

866
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:28,872
No, he's fishing in Alaska
till the end of the season.

867
01:19:30,245 --> 01:19:31,542
Fishing.

868
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:33,205
In Alaska.

869
01:19:50,632 --> 01:19:51,621
Nice.

870
01:19:55,637 --> 01:19:57,628
That's not distracting.

871
01:19:57,706 --> 01:19:59,697
How embarrassing.

872
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:07,504
God.

873
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:10,276
Yes!

874
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,183
- Want a piece of gum?
- Yeah.

875
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:27,900
Choke me. Choke me. Come on. Come on.

876
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:32,131
I know. I'm sorry.

877
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,698
- Come on.
- She doesn't ever close the door.

878
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:35,800
Yeah.

879
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:43,912
Keep going.

880
01:20:44,987 --> 01:20:46,750
Come on.

881
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:03,327
Gross.

882
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:08,242
Hey.

883
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:11,741
Is there any more beer left in the car?

884
01:21:16,285 --> 01:21:18,082
What the hell you doing?

885
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:22,988
It's okay. It's all right.
I'm just... Taking the edge off.

886
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:26,588
Extraordinary times, right?

887
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:33,899
Hey, you can give me a break, can't you?
You're my buddy, aren't you?

888
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:39,401
Hey. Come on.
We've been to hell and back together.

889
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:43,201
Three years just like that.

890
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:46,805
You know what? He knows what he's doing.
It's good. Let's just go to sleep.

891
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:48,372
Yeah, lets go to bed.

892
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:52,045
- Go to bed.
- Fucking asshole.

893
01:22:01,563 --> 01:22:04,123
I'm more fun when I drink.

894
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:07,463
Sergeant.

895
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:10,835
You missed out. That's the whole problem.

896
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:15,240
That is the whole problem
this time around in Iraq.

897
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:20,373
Vietnam, those guys
got laid six ways from Sunday.

898
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:24,881
Bosnia... Best brothels in the world.

899
01:22:24,953 --> 01:22:30,687
Desert Storm... we had R and R ships
with Filipino hookers...

900
01:22:30,759 --> 01:22:32,886
...on call.

901
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:38,563
Yeah, but this war? I don't know.

902
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:44,863
All the religious bullshit, the Crusades
and <i>jihad</i> and nobody getting laid.

903
01:22:45,974 --> 01:22:51,276
I mean, that right there is half the reason
why everybody's so angry, yeah?

904
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:54,809
Hey, Charlie, don't surf!

905
01:22:58,287 --> 01:23:00,016
- Let's get back.
- Yeah.

906
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:04,422
I'm thinking maybe
I ought to have a kid.

907
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:07,087
I shouldn't have let you drink.

908
01:23:07,162 --> 01:23:10,131
No, see, that is your other problem
right there, hero.

909
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:14,363
Everything's your fault.
Everything is your responsibility.

910
01:23:14,436 --> 01:23:18,600
Somebody's gonna fall to pieces?
Well, here's Will with a glue stick.

911
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:22,138
Some soldier gets drunk...
Hey, let me tell you something.

912
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:26,306
I had a beer last month, okay?

913
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:29,248
A few weeks ago, I had a few more.

914
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:31,252
- The other day...
- You serious?

915
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:34,817
Today is not the day
that I got off the wagon.

916
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:39,054
This is the day that I'm gonna not
bother pretending anymore.

917
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:50,360
Stay the fuck away from us, you assholes!

918
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:53,431
Motherfuckers! Goddamn it!

919
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:54,532
It's okay.

920
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:56,236
Fuck you!

921
01:23:56,311 --> 01:23:57,869
Let's head back.

922
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,771
Stone, let's head back.

923
01:24:02,851 --> 01:24:04,614
Where'd you learn about knots?

924
01:24:04,686 --> 01:24:06,517
Oh, Boy Scouts.

925
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:11,423
They sure love a good knot. Easy to tie,
easy to untie, hard to pull loose.

926
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:13,427
Dude, what's your fucking problem, anyway?

927
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:15,190
You own this lake?

928
01:24:21,636 --> 01:24:23,900
- Lock and load, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sir.

929
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:25,735
Hey, ladies.

930
01:24:25,807 --> 01:24:28,708
- What sorority you girls belong to?
- What the fuck?

931
01:24:33,715 --> 01:24:38,379
Boy, those girls sure overreacted.
Just a little fight is all.

932
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:44,086
I thought they was cool.

933
01:24:45,494 --> 01:24:46,893
Sorry, buddy.

934
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:54,328
Hey, how far did you get
with that girl, Laura?

935
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:56,564
- Lara.
- Lara.

936
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:59,436
What a name, Lara.

937
01:25:09,117 --> 01:25:14,521
<i>Give me a home</i>
<i>where the buffalo roam</i>

938
01:25:14,589 --> 01:25:18,753
<i>Where the deer</i>
<i>and the antelope play</i>

939
01:25:21,897 --> 01:25:27,858
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>
<i>a discouraging word</i>

940
01:25:29,104 --> 01:25:33,871
<i>And the skies</i>
<i>are not cloudy all day</i>

941
01:25:34,576 --> 01:25:39,206
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

942
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:44,048
<i>Where the deer</i>
<i>and the antelope play</i>

943
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:51,689
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>
<i>a discouraging word</i>

944
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:57,062
<i>And the skies</i>
<i>are not cloudy all day</i>

945
01:25:57,132 --> 01:25:58,827
Whoo!

946
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:03,496
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

947
01:26:09,611 --> 01:26:12,978
Bill! Hi. Good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

948
01:26:30,499 --> 01:26:33,798
You should have RSVP'd, okay?
Alan is gonna freak.

949
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:37,805
Hey. I didn't know you...

950
01:26:37,873 --> 01:26:39,773
Alan, good to see you. Long time.

951
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:43,036
Yeah. Jesus, you look terrible.

952
01:26:43,111 --> 01:26:45,443
I feel terrible.

953
01:26:47,849 --> 01:26:52,582
Tony, this is Alan.
Alan, Tony, groom-to-be.

954
01:26:52,654 --> 01:26:55,748
Hey, Tony.
What happened to you guys?

955
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:59,885
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
We do all our own stunts, you know.

956
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:04,091
Kelly, Tony. Tony, Kelly. Bride.

957
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:06,360
<i>Enchant.</i> Hubba-hubba.

958
01:27:10,372 --> 01:27:14,172
Well... Let's get these guys
some drinks.

959
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:17,902
- I was just about to sober up. Come on.
- Sounds good.

960
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:22,075
Let's go, Alan.
Come on. All right?

961
01:27:26,655 --> 01:27:28,145
- You look beautiful.
- Don't.

962
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:30,853
You do.

963
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,621
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

964
01:27:42,103 --> 01:27:45,163
So, on behalf of everyone in the room...

965
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,606
...and those who couldn't
make it here tonight...

966
01:27:50,011 --> 01:27:53,947
Kelly and Alan...

967
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:58,218
...here's to a lifetime together, huh?

968
01:27:58,286 --> 01:28:00,220
Hear! Hear!

969
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:01,983
Whoo! Kelly and Alan.

970
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:07,694
Hey, there's a lot better things
we could be doing right now than talking.

971
01:28:07,762 --> 01:28:09,821
I would like to say something.

972
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:16,936
Jesus Christ. Before you do...

973
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:21,704
I would like everyone to toast our troops.

974
01:28:21,776 --> 01:28:23,903
Hear! Hear!

975
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:28,643
Love the war or hate it,
we support you guys all the way.

976
01:28:28,717 --> 01:28:31,277
Hear! Hear!

977
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:37,014
- They support us.
- All the way.

978
01:28:38,526 --> 01:28:39,823
Alan...

979
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:43,156
Kelly...

980
01:28:44,232 --> 01:28:45,961
...family and friends...

981
01:28:54,009 --> 01:28:56,978
...the Secretary of the Army...

982
01:28:57,045 --> 01:29:01,880
...is pleased to congratulate you
on your engagement.

983
01:29:04,452 --> 01:29:06,818
<i>We love it here</i>
<i>We love it here</i>

984
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:10,255
<i>You bet your ass</i>
<i>We love it here</i>

985
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:12,691
- Hoo-ahh!
- Hoo-ahh!

986
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:19,997
Back away.

987
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:35,177
Go, Sergeant!

988
01:29:37,452 --> 01:29:39,079
Fuck me.

989
01:29:43,892 --> 01:29:46,224
You just caught a. 556 in your upper lip!

990
01:29:46,294 --> 01:29:47,420
Bang!

991
01:29:47,495 --> 01:29:48,484
Boom.

992
01:29:56,805 --> 01:30:00,468
This is America!

993
01:31:15,016 --> 01:31:16,142
Hey.

994
01:31:19,654 --> 01:31:20,780
Hey.

995
01:31:27,662 --> 01:31:29,220
It's time to wake up.

996
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:37,495
Jesus, am I dead?

997
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,364
No.

998
01:31:43,444 --> 01:31:46,038
Oh, dear God, help me.

999
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,522
I gotta call my sponsor.

1000
01:32:10,104 --> 01:32:12,538
We should both
get out of this together.

1001
01:32:13,942 --> 01:32:15,432
You could retire.

1002
01:32:17,545 --> 01:32:20,013
We'd go fishing in Alaska.

1003
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:30,755
Nah, this Dorsett will never let me go.

1004
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:32,417
He doesn't own you.

1005
01:32:33,995 --> 01:32:35,758
He saved my life.

1006
01:32:36,497 --> 01:32:40,627
Got me sober... Until yesterday.

1007
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:46,365
The army owns me and that's fine with me.

1008
01:32:50,345 --> 01:32:53,610
That's not fine with me.
Come on.

1009
01:33:09,764 --> 01:33:11,925
All I ever wanted...

1010
01:33:13,401 --> 01:33:15,062
was to get shot at.

1011
01:33:19,007 --> 01:33:23,637
That too much to ask for
on the battlefield? A battle?

1012
01:33:27,415 --> 01:33:29,940
I thought you said you had your baptism.

1013
01:33:33,588 --> 01:33:35,180
Yeah, well, I lied.

1014
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:39,520
Wasn't much of a war.

1015
01:34:01,215 --> 01:34:02,375
Heads up.

1016
01:34:12,293 --> 01:34:14,591
Dale Martin's my name.
Do you remember me?

1017
01:34:16,297 --> 01:34:17,286
Yes, sir.

1018
01:34:32,914 --> 01:34:35,678
You know what's the last thing
my son said to me?

1019
01:34:37,885 --> 01:34:43,323
He said,
"I'll see you next week. " On the phone.

1020
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:45,382
That's what he said, from over there.

1021
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:52,229
And all I said was, "Yeah. "

1022
01:34:56,938 --> 01:34:57,927
I'm...

1023
01:35:00,008 --> 01:35:01,771
I'm not a good talker.

1024
01:35:05,079 --> 01:35:06,307
But...

1025
01:35:10,151 --> 01:35:12,745
Will you please forgive me?

1026
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:20,486
Sir, there's nothing to forgive.

1027
01:35:43,251 --> 01:35:45,719
Mama said there'd be days like these.

1028
01:35:58,332 --> 01:36:04,100
<i>Our LT was taking fire</i>
<i>two blocks down...</i>

1029
01:36:04,172 --> 01:36:08,871
<i>and so I made a decision</i>
<i>to move up this alleyway...</i>

1030
01:36:08,943 --> 01:36:12,401
<i>so we could get into this</i> haji <i>market</i>
<i>that I knew had roof access.</i>

1031
01:36:15,316 --> 01:36:18,149
Sniper fire came down on us
from everywhere.

1032
01:36:18,219 --> 01:36:20,517
It was just pop, pop, pop, pop.

1033
01:36:20,588 --> 01:36:26,151
And we're all scrambling
around trying to get some cover...

1034
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:28,252
when an IED goes off.

1035
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:29,990
You know, blows us back.

1036
01:36:31,999 --> 01:36:33,489
And we're all...

1037
01:36:38,139 --> 01:36:42,269
But I can see Timmerman
is still standing, and he has...

1038
01:36:43,144 --> 01:36:47,376
...he has this flap hanging off
the side of his head...

1039
01:36:47,448 --> 01:36:50,110
...and when he turns around,
I can see it's the...

1040
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:52,379
I can see it's the side of his face.

1041
01:36:52,453 --> 01:36:56,947
Two of my guys behind us are hit
and I'm yelling at them...

1042
01:36:57,024 --> 01:37:00,289
...you know, yelling,
"Get out of the road"...

1043
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:03,194
...but they're screaming so loud
they can't hear me.

1044
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:07,963
So I take off. I pick one of 'em up.

1045
01:37:09,837 --> 01:37:11,134
He was...

1046
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,567
I don't know,
third month, fourth month, 18, 19.

1047
01:37:16,644 --> 01:37:18,635
Pull the other one with my free hand...

1048
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,341
...take us and drop them behind
these truck tires.

1049
01:37:21,415 --> 01:37:26,216
And we're all catching our breath,
trying to radio the bird...

1050
01:37:28,256 --> 01:37:29,780
when I see Derek...

1051
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:33,717
...just bleeding out in the middle
of the street.

1052
01:37:33,794 --> 01:37:35,785
Now, sniper fire had slowed...

1053
01:37:37,665 --> 01:37:39,656
...and he was on his back.

1054
01:37:41,969 --> 01:37:44,233
He had his hands up like this.

1055
01:37:44,305 --> 01:37:48,139
Looked like he was... Like he was praying.

1056
01:37:48,209 --> 01:37:53,169
Nothing but noise from the radio,
so I make a mad dash to him.

1057
01:37:53,848 --> 01:37:56,146
It's pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

1058
01:37:56,217 --> 01:38:00,017
Grab his wrist, drag him across the street
behind this burned-out old car.

1059
01:38:01,722 --> 01:38:04,418
And he looking down at his hands.

1060
01:38:04,492 --> 01:38:06,221
He keeps looking down at his damn hands.

1061
01:38:06,294 --> 01:38:09,422
He keeps opening them and closing them...

1062
01:38:09,497 --> 01:38:12,898
...and he's opening,
he keeps saying over and over...

1063
01:38:12,967 --> 01:38:16,368
"I can't feel my hands.
I can't feel my hands. "

1064
01:38:16,437 --> 01:38:19,235
And I'm looking down at his hands.
His hands are fine.

1065
01:38:19,307 --> 01:38:21,468
There's not a spot on them...

1066
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:24,409
when his left leg is, you know,
halfway down the block.

1067
01:38:24,478 --> 01:38:29,040
So I start pushing him
underneath the car...

1068
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:33,345
...and I'm saying, " Derek, your hands
are fine. Your hands are fine.

1069
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:36,179
Just sit tight. "

1070
01:38:36,257 --> 01:38:40,819
And he looked at me like I was...

1071
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:43,227
He looked at me like I was lying to him.

1072
01:38:45,433 --> 01:38:47,901
And that's when the IED
went off under him.

1073
01:38:51,405 --> 01:38:52,565
Jesus.

1074
01:38:55,309 --> 01:38:59,769
I actually got pieces of him
blasted right into me.

1075
01:38:59,847 --> 01:39:01,337
It was like...

1076
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:04,951
...flesh shrapnel.

1077
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:08,381
When I came to,
I had already been to the FOB.

1078
01:39:08,456 --> 01:39:12,222
I was on my way to Ramstein. In the hospital,
I'm laid out and some guy comes in.

1079
01:39:12,293 --> 01:39:17,060
I can't see very well,
and he drops this little...

1080
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:19,793
...drops a little ribbon
on my bare chest and I'm...

1081
01:39:19,867 --> 01:39:25,806
I'm all hooked up to wires and machines
and heart rate monitors...

1082
01:39:27,475 --> 01:39:29,409
IV's and shit.

1083
01:39:29,477 --> 01:39:31,911
Shit I, you know, shit I don't need.

1084
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:33,879
And he...

1085
01:39:35,616 --> 01:39:38,107
...he says, " Son...

1086
01:39:41,122 --> 01:39:42,646
...you're a hero. "

1087
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:45,986
Damn right, you are.

1088
01:39:47,595 --> 01:39:48,653
No.

1089
01:39:51,866 --> 01:39:54,357
No, I... No.

1090
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:57,860
I put him there.

1091
01:39:58,939 --> 01:40:00,429
I did that.

1092
01:40:02,043 --> 01:40:04,841
That was me.
I didn't mean to. I didn't plan that.

1093
01:40:04,912 --> 01:40:06,937
There's no planning. You can't plan.

1094
01:40:08,683 --> 01:40:10,878
You only have the moment,
but that's what I did.

1095
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:12,111
I...

1096
01:40:13,988 --> 01:40:16,354
I loaded him into the bomb.

1097
01:40:26,967 --> 01:40:29,026
That's not a hero in my book.

1098
01:40:32,873 --> 01:40:36,775
A couple weeks later,
I'm on crutches.

1099
01:40:40,147 --> 01:40:43,480
Major surgery. Fox eye shield patch.

1100
01:40:44,452 --> 01:40:50,220
And everything looks gray...
the nurses, the flowers, blood.

1101
01:40:51,092 --> 01:40:53,686
I'm wandering the halls in the hospital.

1102
01:40:57,665 --> 01:40:59,223
My ears are ringing.

1103
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,367
I take the elevator up to the roof
and climb the stairs.

1104
01:41:03,437 --> 01:41:05,997
And we're not supposed to be up there...

1105
01:41:06,073 --> 01:41:10,908
...but that's where the doctors
take their smoke breaks.

1106
01:41:12,413 --> 01:41:13,903
So the door was open.

1107
01:41:15,282 --> 01:41:16,772
And the whole...

1108
01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:23,818
...the whole living thing just didn't,
you know, make sense anymore.

1109
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:25,222
It was...

1110
01:41:28,162 --> 01:41:30,187
I was out there for a while...

1111
01:41:33,634 --> 01:41:35,124
...standing on the edge...

1112
01:41:37,204 --> 01:41:41,231
...and it was cold and it was dark...

1113
01:41:43,978 --> 01:41:45,605
...and I felt calm.

1114
01:41:48,015 --> 01:41:49,573
Why didn't you jump?

1115
01:42:03,197 --> 01:42:04,789
The sun came up.

1116
01:42:07,301 --> 01:42:08,825
The sun came up?

1117
01:42:09,837 --> 01:42:11,031
Yes.

1118
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:15,074
The sun came up and...

1119
01:42:16,277 --> 01:42:18,837
...and I didn't feel like dying anymore.

1120
01:42:24,752 --> 01:42:26,242
Want another one?

1121
01:42:28,756 --> 01:42:30,246
No, I just...

1122
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:33,392
Pepsi.

1123
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:36,555
This fake beer tastes like laundry.

1124
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:11,449
Pass me the ball. Pass me the ball.

1125
01:44:15,596 --> 01:44:17,086
Where you heading?

1126
01:44:17,765 --> 01:44:19,665
Louisiana.

1127
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:24,660
Taking the piano.

1128
01:44:26,574 --> 01:44:28,064
What?

1129
01:44:28,142 --> 01:44:29,632
Why?

1130
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:32,178
- Do you play?
- No.

1131
01:44:34,448 --> 01:44:35,938
A little bit.

1132
01:44:37,284 --> 01:44:41,118
My mom forced me when I was a kid.

1133
01:44:41,789 --> 01:44:43,313
I hated it.

1134
01:44:45,225 --> 01:44:47,090
Hey, you don't have to...

1135
01:44:51,165 --> 01:44:52,655
Thanks a lot.

1136
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,215
- Yes!
- Good-bye, Will.

1137
01:45:18,626 --> 01:45:20,025
Good luck.

1138
01:45:25,432 --> 01:45:29,334
Look, I've never been very good at timing.

1139
01:45:31,538 --> 01:45:33,529
I wouldn't say that.

1140
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:40,575
Maybe... You'd let me know where you are,
you know, your address?

1141
01:45:41,915 --> 01:45:43,815
I don't mind driving.

1142
01:45:51,258 --> 01:45:53,249
I think I could handle that.

1143
01:45:54,995 --> 01:45:56,189
Okay?

1144
01:45:57,131 --> 01:45:58,689
Okay.

1145
01:46:02,636 --> 01:46:03,864
E- Mail?

1146
01:46:05,205 --> 01:46:08,231
Yeah. I just have to get a computer first.

1147
01:46:08,942 --> 01:46:10,910
I could check at Tony's, though.

1148
01:46:12,246 --> 01:46:13,736
You're staying on?

1149
01:46:13,814 --> 01:46:15,714
Thinking about it.

1150
01:46:24,124 --> 01:46:29,687
Why don't you come inside
and give me your address...

1151
01:46:29,763 --> 01:46:31,856
...and I'll write you a letter.

1152
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,124
I'd like that.

1153
01:46:48,749 --> 01:46:50,410
Yeah.ff
