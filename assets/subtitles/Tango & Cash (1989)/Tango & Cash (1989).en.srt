1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,178
Okay, let's do it.

2
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,363
10-4, 20 William 12.

3
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,283
We have you eastbound,
in pursuit of tanker truck.

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,285
Backup is available.

5
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,412
Air Unit 3 is in the area.

6
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,789
I see him, but I can handle this myself.

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,292
This is Air Unit 3. Forget it, Tango.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,419
We'll take it from here. Drop back.

9
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,964
Drop dead. I've been on this case
for three months. I'm going around.

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,157
We're out of our jurisdiction, Tango.
County sheriff and CHP are on the way.

11
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,534
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

12
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,994
And good luck.

13
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,454
Thanks. Over.

14
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,714
- Jesus!
- Shit!

15
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,805
This guy's crazy!

16
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,062
Shit!

17
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,398
Jesus!

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,745
Glad you could drop in.

19
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,581
You like jewelry?

20
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,875
Fuck you!

21
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,168
I prefer blonds.

22
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,963
Do the honors.

23
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,370
- Ray.
- Hey, captain.

24
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,788
What the hell's going on here?

25
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,707
Just letting the locals do their thing.

26
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,667
- You blew out the truck window.
- I noticed.

27
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,086
- Two guys are in the road.
- I noticed.

28
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,797
- We're out of our jurisdiction here.
- That's true.

29
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,425
- What the hell's going on?
- I heard a rumor about this truck.

30
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,677
- What about this truck?
- It's not a truck.

31
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,804
- It's a gas truck.
- No.

32
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,724
It's a major moving violation.

33
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,187
- Did you check the first panel?
- It's full of gas, sir.

34
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,440
We checked the whole truck, asshole!
There's nothing in it!

35
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,193
And you're out of your neighborhood,
big city boy!

36
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,238
I want your badge! I want your weapon!
I want your ass!

37
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,989
Who in the fuck do you think you are?!

38
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,658
He thinks he's Rambo.

39
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,827
Rambo...

40
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,496
...is a pussy.

41
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,088
What do you know, it's snowing!

42
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,765
Anybody want to get high?

43
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,684
I'll be damned!

44
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,020
Not bad for a city guy.

45
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,820
Ray Tango.

46
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,197
He's done it to us again.

47
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,157
If it isn't Tango, it's Cash.

48
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,035
Tango and Cash! Cash and Tango!

49
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,913
These two cops are driving me crazy.

50
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,207
We have to do something about this.

51
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,753
I agree. I would like to handle
this myself, Mr. Perret.

52
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,047
No, we will handle it.

53
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,716
No.

54
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,218
Not that way.

55
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,723
I have something else in mind.

56
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,193
Hey, Cash!

57
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,854
Well, if it isn't Armani with a badge.

58
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,797
Look out!

59
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,724
Police business!

60
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,518
Hey! This is my car!

61
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,894
Move!

62
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,698
What are you doing to my car?!

63
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,226
Son of a bitch!

64
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,311
What's the matter, ace?
Got a little headache?

65
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,146
You crazy guy!

66
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,690
What did you do with my car?!

67
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,609
I believe in perestroika!

68
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,695
Welcome to America!

69
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,210
Hey, Tango, I saw your picture in the paper.

70
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,421
- Nice suit.
Thanks. Morning.

71
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,844
- Hey, Ray? Look at this.
- Yeah.

72
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,430
Blind luck.

73
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,640
Hey, Ray.
- Yeah.

74
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,643
- Catherine's in your office.
- Ah, that's great.

75
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,063
Catherine, you just don't take off...

76
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,065
...on the spur of the moment. It's...

77
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,150
What? Illogical?

78
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,986
- Very!
- It's not that big a deal.

79
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,821
I'll be gone a month or two.

80
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,323
It takes that long to build a house,
not take a vacation.

81
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:40,161
A dance tour is not a vacation!
And besides, I just wanna get away.

82
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,831
You got everything you need
right here in this town.

83
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,499
Grime, crime and slime.

84
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,585
No, thanks.
I'd really rather be out of here.

85
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,672
Okay, then at least let me have
the phone numbers where I can reach you.

86
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,550
Why don't I just call you?

87
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,678
Why don't you just call me?

88
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,104
Catherine, if you're feeling stressed,
don't run away.

89
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,523
Stay here and we can
deal with this together.

90
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,191
Don't make me feel guilty.

91
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,361
I just feel like I need
some time alone, okay?

92
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,865
And I promise, lieutenant,
that I will be a good girl.

93
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,908
There it is!

94
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,869
The key word.

95
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,579
"Good. "

96
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:27,125
You're telling me you'll be this good girl
because you know, don't you...

97
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,919
...automatically, I think you'll be bad.

98
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,256
- Yes?
- Hey, Ray, what's a margin call?

99
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,425
- Why?
- Your stockbroker's on line 3.

100
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,136
- Says it's urgent.
- This is very important. Don't leave.

101
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,846
Yeah?

102
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,266
Hold on. Catherine.

103
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,226
I'm sorry, I have a plane to catch.

104
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,520
Catherine, don't go.

105
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,314
Think positive.

106
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,233
Shit!

107
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,779
Harvey, yeah. Yeah, it's me, sure.

108
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,332
Good thing you wore a vest.
Hardly needed it with these.

109
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,542
Half-load soft lead slugs.

110
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,420
This guy was really sloppy.

111
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,343
Oh, boy.

112
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,178
Look at this, will you?

113
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,307
This shirt cost me 9 bucks.
Get me a new vest, will you?

114
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,352
Whoa, whoa, whoa, pizza!

115
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,948
Who's been fucking with my gun?

116
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,242
The sight's shifted on it.

117
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,953
- Maybe you dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.

118
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,456
- Hey, captain!
Yeah, Gabe.

119
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,250
You get anything out of that guy?

120
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,713
Nothing, he doesn't speak any English.
Our interpreter says he wants a lawyer.

121
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,798
- Let me question him.
- Question him?

122
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,593
The guy that just tried
to blow you away? Forget it!

123
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,805
Stay away from him, Gabe.

124
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,858
Hi.

125
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,862
So you don't know any English, huh?

126
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,158
I don't know much Chinese, so we'll
have to give you a crash course, buddy.

127
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,245
But I got a feeling you're gonna be
a real quick learner.

128
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,124
Yeah, come here. Sit down.
There we go.

129
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,627
All right, this is lesson number one.

130
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,713
And the next lessons do get harder.

131
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,506
Who hired you to kill me?

132
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,675
I don't know!

133
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,510
"I don't know. "

134
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,347
Nope, wrong answer. Try again.

135
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,268
I think he's one of Quan's men.

136
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,354
I don't know his name. I swear!

137
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,690
Look at that, Flattop.

138
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,526
You're speaking like a native already.

139
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,070
What is this?
- English 101.

140
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,075
Since your scumbag lawyer
won't be here for quite some time...

141
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,036
...is there anything else
you wanna share?

142
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,163
Think hard.

143
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,249
A deal. Tonight.

144
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,543
4942...

145
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,545
...Front Street. 9:00.

146
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,047
Very good.

147
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,550
My compliments.

148
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,096
Pretty good for your first lesson.
Don't forget to wash your hands.

149
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,225
Ray? Your ship's come in.

150
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,894
There's a big bust going down
at 4942 Front Street.

151
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,563
- Great. Is that reliable?
- Very reliable. A phone tap.

152
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,024
- Fantastic.
- What the hell is this?

153
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,902
Downtown clown
versus Beverly Hills wop.

154
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,531
- All the news that's fit to print.
- I don't understand you.

155
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,243
You make a shitload of money.
What are you doing this for?

156
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,786
- Action.
- Action?

157
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,246
Good old American action.

158
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,124
If you want to stare death in the eye,
you should've gotten married.

159
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,793
Is that a proposal?

160
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,996
Gabriel Cash.

161
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,706
Oh, God.

162
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,958
How many millions? How many?

163
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,877
How many this time?

164
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,851
Oh, God!

165
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,228
Ray Tango!

166
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,188
How he loves to dance.

167
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,483
He waltzes in and takes all my drugs...

168
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,653
...and then Tangos back out again.

169
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,156
I've had enough of this.

170
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,742
Too much television...

171
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,829
...can hurt your eyes.

172
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,960
Now... Now do you understand
why we mustn't kill them?

173
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,713
No, Mr. Perret. I do not understand.

174
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,840
It would be much quicker.

175
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,342
And easier.

176
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,262
Quicker...

177
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,389
...and easier.

178
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,559
Yes, quick and easy
is how you make a cake.

179
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,395
Or clean a toilet bowl, or shop...

180
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,022
...by mail.

181
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:46,361
But quick and easy is not how you run
a multimillion-dollar business such as ours.

182
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,363
Now, Mr. Quan.

183
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,032
On the east side...

184
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,369
That's your part of the city.

185
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,829
- Gabriel Cash...

186
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,916
...has cost me more than $60 million...

187
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,045
...including guns, drugs
and various other enterprises.

188
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,880
On the west side...

189
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,590
...Mr. Lopez...

190
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,219
...Ray Tango...

191
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,888
...has cost me even more.

192
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,142
Two little mice...

193
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,228
...and so much damage.

194
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,983
But...

195
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,905
...if we kill them,
we risk all-out war with the police.

196
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,658
They're heroes already.

197
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,618
Why make martyrs of them?

198
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,955
Instead of death...

199
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,083
...we have a game.

200
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,752
A game that only we can win.

201
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,714
Within two weeks...

202
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:54,429
...I will be taking delivery
of the largest shipment of weapons...

203
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,264
...that we have ever handled.

204
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,267
Within that time...

205
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,064
...Tango...

206
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,524
...and Cash...

207
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,404
...will be safely tucked away...

208
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,660
...behind bars.

209
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,960
Aren't they beautiful?

210
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,649
You almost got yourself killed, pal.

211
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,610
I'd say it's the other way around.

212
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,613
I pull this trigger,
your throat's hanging off that wall.

213
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,616
You pull that trigger,
I'll blow you in half.

214
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,493
You never had a chance
to hit me with that gun.

215
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,287
Not with this one. This one.

216
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,336
- You know me, huh?
- I hear you're the second-best cop in L.A.

217
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,129
I heard the same thing about you.

218
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,465
- Stay off my case.
- What makes it your case?

219
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,217
I've been on it for three months.

220
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,721
Then you're stupid. I've been on it for half
an hour now and I'm all caught up with you.

221
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,807
- Stay off my case.
- Nice tie.

222
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,813
It's your bust.
How do you wanna do this?

223
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,483
- I'll go first. Cover me on three.
- Okay.

224
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,026
One.

225
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,820
- Two.
- Three.

226
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,323
Freak!

227
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,991
What's the score, babe?

228
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,748
My turn. Don't move!

229
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,334
Don't move your hands.

230
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,672
I don't think his hands
are going anywhere.

231
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,009
Wanna do the honors?

232
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,308
He's wired.

233
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,312
No, no, no. This is all wrong!

234
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,524
You ought to be a cop.
Did you expect this?

235
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,444
No, I didn't this,
and I didn't expect you, either.

236
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,698
Why the hell is he wired?

237
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:28,160
I don't know, but
you'll play hell getting anything out of him.

238
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,079
I'm gone. Ciao, babe.

239
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,875
Drop your weapons!

240
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,877
- Freeze!
- We're cops!

241
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:41,716
Wait a minute! We're on the same team!
Just read this, goddamn it!

242
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,719
I'm gonna blow
both your fucking brains out!

243
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,596
- No problem.
- I'm convinced.

244
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,056
The man's hysterical.

245
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,225
- I'd like a receipt for that.
- Yeah, me too.

246
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,894
We can talk about this.

247
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,029
Christ, that's my gun.

248
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,491
- What's your gun doing here?
- That's my gun, I put it in my locker.

249
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,744
It's not your gun now!

250
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,997
It's evidence.

251
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,499
Why's your gun here?
They stole it.

252
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,293
Tell me what you did.

253
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,756
I don't know this man.
I didn't come with him.

254
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,843
And with your permission,
I'll be leaving. Ciao.

255
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,929
You may not have arrived with him,
but you're leaving with him.

256
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,431
You're making a mistake.

257
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,933
You're going down for this.

258
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,689
Get these bastards out of here! Now!

259
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,193
- You're bad karma.
- I hope you got a good lawyer.

260
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,798
Perret says use this tape here.

261
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,433
- Is it true Tango shot a federal officer?
- No comment.

262
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,147
- Was Detective Cash there too?
- No comment.

263
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,192
What do they have?

264
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,195
They got a. 380
with Cash's fingerprints.

265
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,074
They think it's the murder weapon.
Ballistics is checking it.

266
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:35,329
They were found at the scene of the crime.
Nobody else was seen coming or going.

267
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,458
What else?

268
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,210
Sir, tape is ready.

269
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,504
What tape?

270
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,803
Show us the money.
It's in the suitcase.

271
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,346
Open it.
It's all there.

272
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,515
- Count it if you want to.
We want to.

273
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,975
Okay, where's the stuff?

274
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,437
Right here. Best high for the buy.
Direct from the department lockup.

275
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,523
You know, I like dealing with cops.
Why's that?

276
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,526
It restores my low opinion
of human nature.

277
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,446
Really? In that case, you'll love this.

278
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,367
Lieutenants Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash...

279
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,829
...two highly decorated officers,
go on trial today...

280
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,374
...for slaying an undercover agent
during a drug-sting operation.

281
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,418
Officers Tango and Cash insist...

282
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,046
...they are victims of a setup,
possibly a retaliation by criminal figures...

283
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,549
...aimed at taking the two top cops
out of action.

284
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,886
Expert witnesses
will lead off the prosecution s case.

285
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,054
Mr. Skinner, you've heard the tapes.

286
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,558
If you had to make a judgment
regarding its authenticity...?

287
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,561
There's no reason for me to believe
it isn't genuine.

288
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,855
How did you test this tape?

289
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,191
I took samples of the suspects' voices...

290
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:49,069
...and compared them to the tape
with an oscilloscope. They matched.

291
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:53,240
When this is over, remind me
to rip Jumbo there's tongue out.

292
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,242
With a tow truck.

293
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,664
When I entered the premises,
I saw the two suspects, the guns...

294
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,793
...the money, the drugs, the dead body.
That's what I saw.

295
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,420
When these two guys show up...

296
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,256
...I figure the whole thing's gone sour.

297
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,926
So I'm gonna go in
and clear everything up...

298
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,178
...when they kill him.

299
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,098
When this is over, we have to pay
Jabba the Hutt here a visit.

300
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,975
I'll bring the chain saw.

301
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,602
I'll bring the beer.

302
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,148
Detective Cash assaulted me.

303
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,651
He put a chair on my chest and sat on it.

304
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,402
I couldn't find a piano.

305
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,908
The son of a bitch can speak English!

306
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,451
The squarecrow can talk!

307
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,787
- Squarecrow?
- What would you call it?

308
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,957
As the attorneys
for Tango and Cash left the courtroom...

309
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,501
...their mood can only
be described as grim.

310
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,336
They clearly face an uphill battle...

311
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,547
...if not an impossible one.

312
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:57,179
Ray, somebody set you up good.
I feel we should cop a plea.

313
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,974
You can guarantee me minimum security?

314
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,018
Absolutely. No question.
That'll be the deal.

315
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,312
Is Cash's attorney
giving him the same advice?

316
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,356
If he's smart, he is.

317
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,359
I want to talk to Cash.

318
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,995
I need to work on my
statement for the court.

319
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,204
Why do you wanna see me?

320
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,207
First of all, I wanna say
I'm not fond of your kind.

321
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,959
Oh, really, what kind is that?

322
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,587
You're a glory hound and a hot dog.

323
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,838
That stings.

324
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,340
Let me know when the critique is over.

325
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,758
It's over.

326
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,053
- My lawyer wants me to cop a plea.
- Mine too. Eighteen months.

327
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,097
Lompoc Federal Country Club.

328
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,851
I understand they open the gym at 5 a. m.
You can start pumping early.

329
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,236
- Who do you think set us up?
- I don't know.

330
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,863
I got a lot of admirers. You?

331
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,990
I got a few.

332
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:03,203
Look, if we cop a plea,
we cop it together.

333
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:07,875
I think what you're saying is your lawyer
wanted you to consider making a deal...

334
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,670
...but you didn't want to leave
this glory hound holding the bag.

335
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,839
Sound about right, Ray?

336
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,591
- About.
- Very generous guy.

337
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,593
- I'll make the statement.
- I will.

338
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,094
- No way.
- Why not?

339
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,929
- You'll screw it up.
- When's your birthday?

340
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,640
- Why?
- When were you born?

341
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,308
- Why?
- Day and month.

342
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,810
- You want to do my horoscope?
- Don't give me the year.

343
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,646
When were you born?

344
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,231
- May.
- February. Ha-ha-ha!

345
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,109
I got seniority.
I'll make the statement.

346
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,236
August 16.

347
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:42,076
I read your records. Isn't that the date
you were hatched? August 16th ring a bell?

348
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,036
I got seniority.

349
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,579
Heh-heh-heh!

350
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,414
All rise.

351
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,671
The court is now in session.

352
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,674
The Honorable
Judge McCormack presiding.

353
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,925
Be seated.

354
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,427
Your Honor.

355
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,889
The defendants wish
to change their plea.

356
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,474
Order!

357
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,853
Very well, counselor.
What is the plea?

358
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,648
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?

359
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,067
Proceed, Mr. Tango.

360
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,654
It's okay.

361
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,829
Your Honor, I've been
a policeman for 12 years.

362
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,082
I think it's the best organization
in the country.

363
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,212
I've been accused of being too aggressive
in taking criminals off the street.

364
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,797
Well, if that's a sin...

365
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,924
...then I guess I'm guilty.

366
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,885
All the cops I've worked with
are good cops.

367
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,929
You are.

368
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,681
Doing a tough job.

369
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:50,853
I only hope that the outcome of this trial
is such that the whole department...

370
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:55,858
...is not judged
by what has transpired here.

371
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,818
Thank you.

372
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,656
Ray. Ray, will you let me handle this?

373
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,243
Not bad.

374
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,163
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Cash?

375
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,750
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- No! No, no.

376
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,877
- Yeah.
- No.

377
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,300
Mr. Tango has spoken very eloquently.

378
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,678
And I wish I could be as forgiving.

379
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,431
But I can't, because...

380
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,059
...this whole thing...

381
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,021
...fucking sucks!

382
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,398
This is the biggest pile of shit!

383
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,693
- Your Honor!
- Order!

384
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,364
That's right! Yeah!

385
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,699
Order!

386
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,369
Your Honor!
Be seated, Mr. Cash.

387
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,959
Your Honor, the defendants
wish to plead no contest...

388
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,545
...to a charge of
voluntary manslaughter.

389
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,798
I take it this is part of an agreement?

390
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,675
Yes. The state recommends a sentence...

391
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:08,055
...of not more than 18 months
in a minimum-security facility.

392
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:14,102
Mr. Cash, Mr. Tango, do you
enter this plea of your own free will?

393
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,147
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,817
The agreement is
acceptable to the court.

395
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,071
The defense and the state
will deliver the proper documentation.

396
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,698
Court is adjourned.

397
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,914
Now that Tango and Cash
are behind bars...

398
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,167
...you don't have to be afraid anymore.

399
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:42,256
What's the matter, gentlemen?
You don't share my enthusiasm.

400
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,091
Mr. Perret, I am sorry...

401
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,428
...but I cannot appreciate
these games you keep playing.

402
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,806
Forgive me for asking, Mr. Perret...

403
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,351
...but what happens in 18 months
when they get out?

404
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,021
Use your imagination.

405
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,611
What makes you think
they'll ever get out again?

406
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,157
Now go take care of your business.

407
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,744
I got a feeling this is
gonna be a great year.

408
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,375
These bozos ever hear
of shock absorbers? Welcome to Club Fed.

409
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,711
You told me this was a vacation.

410
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,132
End of the line. Get out.

411
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,968
You, this way!

412
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,271
What do you got to say now, genius?

413
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,901
I don't think there's
a golf course here.

414
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,821
Make yourselves
at home sweet home, boys.

415
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,116
This has gotta be a mistake.
What do you think?

416
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,037
I think my underwear
is riding into my throat. Ow!

417
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,665
They're not there?
They were on that bus!

418
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,001
I'm already trying to trace them.

419
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,922
They were transferred
off the bus near Victorville.

420
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,214
We gotta find them.

421
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,383
Your underwear problem is solved.

422
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,178
I noticed. You can stop
holding in your stomach.

423
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,892
Come on! Somebody bribed
the prison board! That's why we're here!

424
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,520
They're as crooked as
everybody else in this deal.

425
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,648
Oh, man.

426
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:27,361
I'll tell you one thing.
Whoever set us up is fucking connected.

427
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,738
Who do you think it is, Quan?

428
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,365
Thanks.

429
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,327
No, wait! I got it!

430
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,120
It's Lopez!

431
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,539
It's Lopez! Follow me through here.

432
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,876
Lopez has a guy pretend
to try and kill me...

433
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,045
...and claims that Quan put him up to it.

434
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,256
That Chinese guy feeds me
bogus information about the setup.

435
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:52,386
That way Lopez figures, no matter
what happens, I'll think it was Quan.

436
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:56,223
All the time it's Lopez,
and now I know it, right?

437
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,392
Well, what do you think?

438
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,312
I think with your IQ,
you're unarmed and still very dangerous.

439
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,358
Okay, Sherlock Holmes, if you're so smart,
you tell me who set us up.

440
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,278
- I don't know yet.
- Yeah! You don't know shit!

441
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,573
What are you doing?

442
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,158
Relax.

443
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,910
Soap.

444
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,245
And don't flatter yourself.

445
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,038
Peewee.

446
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,916
I don't know you that well.

447
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,795
Don't worry.
Someday the other one will drop.

448
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,965
Attaboy, tripod! You just keep talking.

449
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,425
Sure thing, Minnie Mouse!

450
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,635
By the way...

451
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,431
...I think they're gonna stick us
in general population.

452
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,974
Yeah?

453
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,936
Well, you know they don't put cops
in general population.

454
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,482
Never put cops in
general population, huh?

455
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,819
Cash, I'll light your fucking bowels!

456
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,779
Cash, I'm gonna put
brown sugar in your ass!

457
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,282
Shit, I put half these guys away.

458
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,035
Tango, you're going to be my bitch!

459
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,661
I'll kick your fucking ass!

460
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,413
- You know what I hate?
What?

461
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,832
Litter.
Goddamn it!

462
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,668
What?
I forgot the marshmallows.

463
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,963
I don't think rehabilitation
is working here.

464
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,340
They're just misunderstood, really.

465
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,176
Cops!

466
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,055
Bring them to me!

467
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,641
Cops! Cops!

468
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,352
Bring them here!

469
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,438
Come here!

470
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,690
I want to talk to you.

471
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,442
Hey, punk!

472
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,321
When I get out of here,
I'll tear you a new ass.

473
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,573
You know Captain Dynaball here?

474
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,911
Yes! Yes! I loved you
in Conan the Barbarian.

475
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,959
If you need me, me and my ass
will be in the neighborhood.

476
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,840
You fucking pig! It's over for you!

477
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,718
You're gonna be very popular here.

478
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,262
Funny, I don't see your fan club, either.

479
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,376
Hey! That crapper is mine!

480
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,588
And what am I supposed to use?

481
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,884
I don't give a shit!
Just don't use that.

482
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,640
Okay, bud. We're gonna
get one thing straight right now.

483
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,727
That is yours!

484
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,405
Would you mind stopping that?

485
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,198
Thank you.

486
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,575
I appreciate it.

487
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,077
I'm not afraid of you.

488
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,875
You see that?

489
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,209
I killed him.

490
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,420
Congratulations.

491
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,422
He was my best friend.

492
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,804
Crazy people aren't afraid of anybody.

493
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,602
Would you look at that?

494
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,356
Sugar is up. I cannot believe this!

495
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,672
Let's dance, Tango!

496
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,840
Come on, Cash!

497
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,134
Get the bag on him!

498
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,642
Kill him!

499
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,019
Kill him!

500
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,562
Kill the fucker!

501
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,530
You're dead meat, Tango!

502
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,480
- They got you?
- What's it look like?

503
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,485
Oh, yeah, let me guess.

504
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,404
The welcoming committee.

505
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,698
It's either that or a surprise party.

506
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,825
Don't make a move.

507
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,994
We'll talk our way out of this.

508
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,913
I don't think they're into small talk.

509
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,082
If we panic, we're history.

510
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,751
Ah, the infamous...

511
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,754
...Cash and Tango.

512
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,757
Dishonored, imprisoned.

513
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,426
What a shameful fall from glory.

514
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,969
And who are you?

515
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,265
Just think of me as somebody who...

516
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,435
...doesn't like you very much.

517
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,604
The surprise party is out.

518
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,152
Oh, shit. That's the guy
I followed to the setup.

519
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,697
Don't panic.

520
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,620
Tarty Tango.
You're a pretty boy, aren't you?

521
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,871
I'm panicking.

522
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,791
How would you like me
to change it for you?

523
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,501
- I wouldn't.
- How about you?

524
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,380
- Maybe you first.
- Don't panic.

525
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,343
I'll cut your throat,
yank your tongue out the hole...

526
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,804
...and tie it in a Windsor knot for you.

527
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,765
- I don't wear ties. That's him.
- Brave boy.

528
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,184
You wanna cut my throat?! Go ahead!

529
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,186
You wanna cut my fucking head off?!

530
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,148
You can bowl the motherfucker
for all I care! Just don't let him do it!

531
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:06,152
I don't wanna get killed by this
limey immigrant jerk-off!

532
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,656
I wanna get killed
by an American jerk-off!

533
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,074
You fucking wanker!

534
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,660
Put it away for now.

535
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,496
Just for now.

536
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,500
Some of your other friends
want to say hello first.

537
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,210
What are you doing?

538
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,379
- Buying time.
- Time for what?

539
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,588
I don't know yet.

540
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,927
- Oh, shit, it's Conan. It's Conan.
- What?

541
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,971
- We're gonna get FUBAR now.
- What's FUBAR?

542
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,431
You'll see.

543
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,058
Real bad-ass cops!

544
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,020
You don't look so tough now, do you?

545
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,605
Do you, you fuck?!

546
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,023
He must mean you.

547
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,025
This pig and his cop friends...

548
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,736
...broke my ribs, my leg and my jaw.

549
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,615
You broke that jaw?

550
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,743
- He deserved it.
Why did you do that?

551
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,078
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

552
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,830
- I was having a bad day!
Like now?

553
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,665
Like now!

554
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,541
Don't panic!

555
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,085
Don't panic!

556
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,275
Rats in a maze...

557
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,528
...men in a cage.

558
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:16,741
Come on, lads. Place your bets!
Which bloke survives?

559
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,660
Who's a brave boy?

560
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,161
Who fries first?

561
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,626
Cook, you bastard!

562
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,462
Tango, you got any family?

563
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,298
Yeah. You?

564
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,010
I'm going steady with an alimony check.
That's about it.

565
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,931
First, Mr. Cash.

566
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,976
No, don't do it! No!

567
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,145
- Cash!
- It's all right, man.

568
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,947
Motherfuck you!

569
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,200
Son of a bitch!

570
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:10,503
Cash!

571
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,882
Fuck you.

572
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,851
Tango?

573
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,187
Fry, Tango.

574
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,581
Get them the hell down!

575
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,419
Off the scaffolding!

576
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,921
Lock this place down!

577
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,509
Ah, shit.

578
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,928
Cash, you fight this one. I'm burned out.

579
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,391
SOKOWSKl: You look like hell, Cash.
- Matt?

580
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:10,146
- Matt, it is you, isn't it? Say it is.
- It is.

581
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,816
- Oh, God, am I glad to see you!
- Cash!

582
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,860
- Yeah?
- My arm.

583
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,240
- Who's this guy?
- Matt Sokowski. I'm assistant warden.

584
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,368
He was my C.O.
When I started on the force.

585
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,662
- You guys are in deep shit.
- Shit.

586
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,915
- Really?
- Yeah. Who the hell set you up?

587
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,000
I think we just met him.

588
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:35,713
If this creep wants us dead so bad,
why doesn't he put a bullet in our head?

589
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,715
Why play this game?

590
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,175
Maybe he has a boring nightlife.

591
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,553
How'd he get in?
- Anything can happen behind these walls.

592
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,265
All you need is the cash.
We have the best guards money can buy.

593
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,477
You got the bucks, you get what you need.
The place is corrupt.

594
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,772
Once you're back in general population,
somebody's gonna nail you.

595
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,983
The way I see it,
you got only one choice: Escape.

596
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,527
Escape?

597
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,820
Yeah.

598
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,948
I'll get a spoon
and we'll start tunneling out of here...

599
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,827
...and you can help me chew through
the bars. Come on, this is bullshit.

600
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,078
What's with your friend?

601
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,914
He's upset. He misses his wardrobe.

602
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,500
What are you saying, Matt?

603
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,961
Listen, I got a plan worked out.

604
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,254
How do we trust him?

605
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,464
We've known each other for 15 years.

606
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,383
- We trusted our lawyers.
And the judge.

607
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,928
And that got us nowhere.
This time, you're gonna have to trust me.

608
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,889
Now that is a risky proposition.

609
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,686
SOKOWSKl:
Come on, Gabe, I got a present for you.

610
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,230
You're unbelievable.

611
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,652
I do miss my wardrobe.

612
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,530
SOKOWSKl:
This is the prison ventilation system.

613
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,450
You get to it from
the utility shaft in the yard.

614
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,786
This main ventilation shaft
leads outside beyond the wall.

615
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,707
I can shut one of these fans down
and leave this vent door unlocked.

616
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,003
I'll get you the right work detail and leave
everything you need outside the shaft.

617
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,297
This way looks faster.

618
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,300
SOKOWSKl: No, long way around.
Let's stick to plan A.

619
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,510
SOKOWSKl:
Let's get you guys to the infirmary.

620
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,053
Why use your plan A?

621
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:10,767
It's a hell of a lot better than your plan B,
which you don't even have.

622
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,853
Not yet, Cash, but I will.

623
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,819
My partner in pain.

624
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,406
I only got a minute.
Sokowski got us trash detail. Let's go.

625
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:29,202
- Whoopee! Race you to the Dumpster.
- It's set up for right now. Come on.

626
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,162
Negative.

627
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,373
- What?
- I'm not going. I changed my mind.

628
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,210
Did you have a brain meltdown?

629
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,129
I have a slight aversion
to getting FUBAR.

630
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,715
- What's FUBAR?
- "Fucked up beyond all recognition. "

631
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,008
What is your problem?

632
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,345
I'm not waltzing into anybody's trap.
I don't trust Sokowski!

633
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,223
Sokowski's a cop, for chrissake!

634
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,392
What's this?

635
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,020
This is my fiancée, Slinky.

636
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,147
Up, Slinky.

637
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,737
- Let's see how business is.
- Seriously...

638
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:09,033
...you are one major mistrustful,
maladjusted human fucking being!

639
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,701
Well, I love you too.

640
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,245
Ray, I'm not coming back for you.

641
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,413
You're making a big mistake.

642
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,917
You don't have to.
I hope you make it on the outside, Cash.

643
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,964
Let's go, you're late!

644
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,094
I hope you and Cousin It here...

645
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,137
...are very happy together...

646
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,974
...and raise a beautiful litter.

647
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:36,102
Ciao.

648
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,676
Where've you been, asshole?
You're a half hour late.

649
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,678
I'm doing my best, boss.

650
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,687
Matt!

651
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,659
There he is!

652
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,161
Come on, let's go!

653
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,053
Out of my way!

654
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,637
What are you doing here?
- I got lonely.

655
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,433
I can't hold it all day!

656
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,360
Shit!

657
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,615
Come on, Cash!

658
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,745
This way!
Come on!

659
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,832
Move it!

660
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,178
Your friend Matt
waltzed you right into a trap!

661
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,721
How could you be so stupid?

662
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,598
Matt's dead.

663
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,768
They cut his throat ear to ear.
Know what I mean?

664
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,353
Ponytail!

665
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,271
Yeah. This is the way.

666
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,037
You'll like this.
It's the best ride in the park.

667
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,956
Come on, this way!

668
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,417
Know where you're going?
Absolutely.

669
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,337
Sure you know where you're going?

670
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,172
I know exactly where I'm going!

671
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,675
Then get your ass out of my face
and get there!

672
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,728
Come on!

673
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,083
Is this the only way?
No.

674
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,627
We can go back. Let's go!

675
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,758
This way!

676
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,013
- You sure this is the way?
- It's exactly the way!

677
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,182
Let's go! Sector 4!

678
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,022
- Tango!
- What?

679
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,107
Don't touch those wires.

680
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,734
Thanks.

681
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,036
- Know what?
- What?

682
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,622
I'm getting real tired of electricity.

683
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,457
Nag, nag, nag!

684
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,223
- Now what?
- Okay, no problem.

685
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,100
Jump to those wires, slide down,
and we're home free.

686
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,104
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

687
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,690
We're gonna fry.

688
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,943
- You know anything about electricity?
- No.

689
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:02,488
If you only touch one wire and don't touch
the ground, you don't get electrocuted.

690
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,451
- Right?
- I don't know.

691
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,661
I don't either.

692
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,414
I owe you from back there.

693
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,541
So you can go first.

694
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,087
- Uh-uh. And you still owe me.
- I knew you'd say that.

695
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,925
If I don't make it, will you even try?

696
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,760
Depends how close you get.

697
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,229
What's the matter, Tango?
Come on, dog!

698
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,073
Come on, dog! Heel!

699
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,120
Come on, puppy!

700
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,372
You want more?

701
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,916
Move it, move it!

702
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,754
Come on, Tango.

703
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,547
Come on, doggy!

704
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,217
Speak, doggy! Speak!

705
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,366
Tango!

706
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,247
That was fun.

707
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,959
Jesus Christ! What did you do,
stop for coffee and a Danish?

708
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,627
I hate Danish.

709
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,839
- Come on, we gotta get out of here.
- All right.

710
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:10,426
- Nice doing time with you.
- I'll never forget that time in the shower.

711
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,512
If it gets too hot for you
in the streets...

712
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,391
...go to a club named Cleopatra's.
Ask for Catherine.

713
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,018
- She'll know where to find me.
- Got it.

714
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,271
Hey, Ray!

715
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,023
I really do owe you one.

716
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,406
Quan and Lopez on line one.

717
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,576
Put them on.

718
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,997
Gentlemen, I've already heard
about the escape.

719
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,790
Mr. Perret...

720
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,917
...this is most disturbing.

721
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,087
We are being threatened by two maniacs.

722
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,381
I think we must take some action.

723
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:54,386
There you go thinking again.
That'll be the cause of your downfall.

724
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,221
Try to control your fear.

725
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,641
These men are convicted killers
and fugitives.

726
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,852
They won't last long on the outside.

727
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:06,982
Mr. Perret, we cannot rely
on the police. I insist...

728
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,567
Don't insist!

729
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:16,158
Insistent people make me angry.

730
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,703
Everything is under control.

731
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,257
Cover your tracks.

732
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,600
Oh, you're beautiful.

733
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,605
Oh, gee. Hope they're all right.

734
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,899
Attention, commencing live fire test.

735
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,372
Owen.

736
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:07,459
Hey, Gabe, I knew you'd come here.
How'd you get out?

737
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,253
You got something I can change into?

738
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,587
Sure, sure.

739
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,551
Nice to see we have
the same taste in clothes.

740
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,428
Hey, Gabe,
do you need a special weapon?

741
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,347
I need a gun, a big gun.

742
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,891
Oh. Are those big enough for you?

743
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,978
Yeah, pefrect.

744
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,233
I always knew we shared
the same taste in weaponry.

745
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,152
Gabe, check out the pooch.

746
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,406
A new invention
in senior-citizen home protection.

747
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,204
Well...

748
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,915
- Well, you know, the gun boots are great.
- Pefrect.

749
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,501
See you, buddy.

750
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,772
Knock, knock.

751
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,110
Yuck!

752
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:19,239
From the look of your diet, you're not
too interested in counting calories.

753
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,659
Could it be you're too busy counting
the money they paid you to set us up?

754
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,620
I didn't set you up.

755
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,663
You think I'm judging you unfairly?

756
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,832
Hell, yes! I had nothing to do with it!

757
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,043
Nothing to do with it?

758
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,297
Wyler, can we be frank?

759
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,174
You're looking terribly anemic.

760
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:41,011
I think what you need
is a little... iron in your diet.

761
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,055
I know you switched those weapons...

762
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,807
...and planted the murder weapon
at the scene, didn't you?

763
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,851
- They paid me.
- Who paid you?

764
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,896
- I don't know.
- You FBI guys are real brainy.

765
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,982
- Think, think, think!
- An Englishman with red hair.

766
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,734
Yeah, and a ponytail.

767
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,654
"You're going down for this. "
Remember those lyrics?

768
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,907
You sang it to me loud and clear.
But you're going down.

769
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:06,411
It doesn't matter. They want me dead.
My life isn't worth shit.

770
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,165
That's true. But I need you anyway.

771
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:14,336
Take me in! I'll tell them what I know!
We'll help each other.

772
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,588
I hope you got paid real well, Wyler.

773
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,715
You wanna split it?

774
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,764
Wyler! Wyler!

775
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,880
Who are you?

776
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,174
What are you doing here?

777
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,969
Who the hell do you think you are?

778
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,971
Excuse me!

779
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,850
Hey!

780
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,898
Who hired you to do the tape, Skinner?

781
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,949
Lucky for me this place is soundproof.

782
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,160
Nobody will hear me
beating the truth out of you.

783
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,997
Hey, I see you got all my greatest hits.

784
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,290
And Tango's.

785
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,084
You put together a nice compilation.

786
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,628
He told me he'd kill me.

787
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,714
- Who?
- He didn't tell me his name.

788
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,340
I swear to God!

789
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,178
How fortunate they asked you
to authenticate your own work.

790
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,139
I am the foremost expert.

791
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,809
You won't be for long if you keep
using junky equipment like this.

792
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,771
What do you mean?
It's state-of-the-art equipment.

793
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,861
What do you want to know?!

794
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,071
- How were you contacted?
- By phone.

795
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,823
- How'd you get him the tape?
- By mail.

796
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,992
- Where to?
- I don't remember the address.

797
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,872
But I recorded the conversation.

798
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,875
- Happy to play it for you.
- There you go!

799
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,884
Captain Schroeder, please.

800
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:30,138
He's got to be there.
Would you check, please?

801
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:36,269
All right. Just tell him his favorite
stockbroker is back in town. He'll know.

802
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,204
- Five-buck cover charge, pal.
- Sure.

803
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,233
- Catherine working tonight?
- Who?

804
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,819
- Catherine.
- Don't know any Catherine.

805
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,074
Catherine here tonight?

806
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,993
We have a hundred Catherines here.

807
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,502
Hey! Joe! Sticks!

808
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,006
Where's my beer?
I'm sorry. He distracted me.

809
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,675
I've been waiting 15 minutes.
I'm sorry.

810
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:34,596
Tell you what, this one's on me.
I'm really sorry.

811
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,946
Cover that exit. Come with me.

812
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,813
What do you think you're doing?

813
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,261
Hold it.

814
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,097
Kiki, nice work.
Wait a minute.

815
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,765
I'm Catherine.

816
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,602
Only one person calls me that.

817
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,815
Ray Tango said you could
help me find him.

818
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,608
I haven't seen Ray in a while.

819
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,070
There's a full-blown
police convention out there.

820
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,407
Is there someplace else we can talk?

821
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,992
Is he all right?

822
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,869
Not if I don't get out of here.

823
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,247
- Out the back, through the alley.
- They'll have it covered.

824
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,791
Any other ideas?

825
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,293
Hey, Elvis!

826
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:29,961
What size do you wear?

827
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,637
Hold it.

828
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,307
Let's have a look.

829
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,312
Something wrong?

830
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,409
Hey, Lynn, let's go!

831
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,349
Hey, Red.

832
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,769
Aerobics instructor, huh?

833
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,189
- Kiki?
- Hey, bud, get your hands off my property.

834
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:38,238
Any chance of a three-way?

835
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,783
Dykes on bikes, eh, captain?

836
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:58,466
So then you knew who I was all along.

837
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,011
I figured it out. You and Ray
have been getting a lot of press lately.

838
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,471
I bet.

839
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,182
We were set up good.

840
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,728
I know. Ray couldn't have
done all the things he's accused of.

841
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,356
You I'm not so sure about.

842
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,899
Ow.

843
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,902
God, how did this happen?

844
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,906
Sliding off a high-tension wire
into a pine tree at 40 mph...

845
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,200
...tends to slip a disk or two.

846
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,620
Let's see if we can slip it back in.

847
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,207
- How's that feel?
- Are you kidding?

848
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:35,253
Six or seven more hours of this
and I'll be on the road to recovery.

849
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,675
So...

850
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,386
...what's the story with you and Ray?

851
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,762
What do you mean?

852
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:49,100
You know.
Do you love him? Hate him?

853
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,144
None of the above?

854
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,313
I love him.

855
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:54,939
You do?

856
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:59,569
Of course. He loves me too.
He just has a funny way of showing it.

857
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:03,156
You guys see a lot of each other?

858
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,325
He comes and goes as he pleases.

859
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,035
That's a little insensitive.

860
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,954
But I live my own life.

861
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,873
Good for you.

862
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,834
Lower.

863
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,221
Kiki?
Yeah?

864
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,601
- Lower?
Yeah.

865
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,019
Harder.

866
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,480
I'll just move it around real slow.

867
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,403
Don't stop.
I can do this all night.

868
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,489
God, prove it.

869
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,658
Faster.

870
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,576
More?

871
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,536
Deeper.
- Oh, my God, Gabe!

872
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:53,081
- I can feel it going in!
Oh! Harder!

873
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,667
- It's almost in!
God! It's all the way in!

874
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,754
Heads up, sleazebag!

875
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,509
Ray?

876
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,804
- Captain?
- This the way you screen all your guests?

877
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,347
I'm sorry, captain.

878
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,933
Freeze! Drop the duck!

879
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:14,018
Tango?

880
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:18,314
Real great police work!
Way to go, Cash! Way to stay on top of it!

881
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,441
- What were you doing?
Nice to see you too.

882
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,443
You almost nailed your captain.

883
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,862
At least I saw him!
What were you doing in there?

884
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,156
I was getting ready to make my move.

885
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:30,034
- By the way, your girlfriend...
- My sister!

886
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:31,494
- My what?
- Your what?

887
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:34,497
- My sister.
- She's your...?

888
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,542
That's great! I don't mean that.

889
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,752
Look, I know it had to look bad.

890
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:43,464
I never deliberately
punched out anyone in my life.

891
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,883
But you I'm gonna hammer
right through the lawn.

892
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,052
- Oh, really?
Who do you think you are?

893
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,597
Don't you know how to use a doorbell?
Just stick out your finger and push.

894
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:54,892
- Isn't this 125 Orange Grove Street?
Yeah, it is.

895
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:58,229
This is my place. I have some rights
under my own place, don't I?

896
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:03,109
No, Catherine. It's my roof, my house,
and I let you dwell here.

897
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,402
I pay you rent!

898
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,196
- You're two weeks late.
- If you would check your mail...

899
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:10,158
Well, in Tango's defense,
he has been in prison.

900
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,664
Excuse me, my pantyhose
are riding into the unknown.

901
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:18,499
Way up in the unknown.

902
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,002
Just answer me one thing, seriously.

903
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,589
What were you doing on the couch
with Queen-for-a-Day?

904
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,926
It's none of your business.

905
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,345
Catherine...

906
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,515
She got the brains and the looks.
How do you figure it?

907
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,100
I don't.

908
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,144
- Smoke?
- No.

909
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,229
To protect against guys like him!

910
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:43,232
All right. All right, that's it!

911
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,318
You're not gonna run us in, are you?

912
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:49,280
No, but I can only keep the department
off your backs for 24 hours.

913
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,199
The feds are on the case!

914
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,869
I suggest you slip into something
a little more butch.

915
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,039
You get rid of Daffy Duck there
and try to clear your names.

916
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,624
Already started.

917
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,584
What do you got?

918
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:04,462
This tape will clear our names.

919
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,464
Compliments of Jumbo the forger.

920
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,757
Skinner?

921
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,343
Yeah. So, what have you got?

922
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,886
About quarter to four.

923
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,890
Look, start with this.

924
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,893
We ID'd that creep from the warehouse.

925
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,271
- Ponytail?
- Yeah. His name's Requin.

926
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,982
Look him up.
The address is right there.

927
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,444
You got 24 hours to find the guy
who set you up.

928
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,155
When's the clock start?
- Five minutes ago.

929
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,157
Catherine.

930
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:34,659
Honestly...

931
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,162
...what were you doing
with the Elephant Man?

932
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,167
Please.

933
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:46,295
Come in the house. Change your clothes.

934
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,007
You'll make a very ugly bride someday.

935
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,843
Is that a proposal?

936
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:01,018
- Blue one's nice.
Blue it is.

937
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,771
Sorry about my behavior tonight.

938
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,149
I just want you to be okay.

939
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,775
I'm okay.

940
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:11,696
I can't believe all that's happened.
How did you get out of prison?

941
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,991
Cash. He had a friend on the inside.

942
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,994
I didn't wanna come here,
but I had no other place to go.

943
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,872
You're my brother.
Where else are you supposed to go?

944
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,958
- The North Pole would be nice.
- Seriously, what are you gonna do?

945
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:26,836
Maybe you'd be better off
turning yourself in.

946
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,796
- And talking to the press.
- No.

947
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:34,886
- How's the career going at the club?
- That's great!

948
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:38,556
You're being hunted
and you're worried about my dancing?

949
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,558
I'm not worried about anything.

950
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:45,021
If you needed a little extra cash,
I could buy you a bond or something.

951
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,690
It's a seven-and-a-quarter yield.

952
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,025
Big money.

953
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:53,863
- You help me out more than you need to.
- No, I don't.

954
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:57,158
I spend so much time with my career,
I hardly get a chance to see you.

955
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:00,661
You have nothing to feel guilty about.
I love you.

956
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,082
Put her there.

957
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,044
Push them back, way back!

958
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,256
I gotta go.
I don't wanna put you in jeopardy.

959
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,260
- What are you talking about?
- All that filth and scum I have to deal with.

960
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,429
- Here I am!
- See?

961
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,723
Clock's running, Ray. Let's go.

962
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:22,725
See you later.

963
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,936
- Mind if I have a word with Kiki?
- No.

964
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,396
I just wanted to say
I was having a wonderful time...

965
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:31,067
...until Captain Fantastic leaped the couch
and smashed through your door.

966
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:36,280
Anyway, when this is straightened out,
could we get together again?

967
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,407
Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice.

968
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,618
Maybe we can go down to the ballpark...

969
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,370
Can I talk to you?

970
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:46,207
Cash, I don't think my sister is your type.

971
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,096
Easy, mate.

972
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:44,807
Come on.

973
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,022
Been expecting you.

974
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:56,569
Shame, shame. Ponytails are out
this season. How you doing, Cash?

975
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:59,780
Things are getting better by the second.

976
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,700
- There's a party on the roof.
- Can I invite Mr. Potato Head?

977
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,494
Sure. Wouldn't be a party
without Potato Head.

978
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,456
No!
Plan A.

979
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:09,999
This party's really fun!

980
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:13,461
Thanks. How about it, Requin?
Hell of a view, huh?

981
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,713
Come on, meat puppet!
Who pulls your strings?

982
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,883
Piss off! Bollocks to plan A!

983
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,969
I like this. The view's great up here!

984
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:25,389
- What'd he say?
- Plan A's a loser.

985
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:30,394
Hold on. Give me a name, Death Breath,
or you're going back to England in a baggie!

986
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:33,898
Up yours, asshole!
You ain't worth a toss.

987
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,358
Go on, drop me.

988
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,817
Do it!

989
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,235
Plan A is definitely a loser.

990
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:41,238
- Bigtime. Let's go to plan B.
- You got a plan B?

991
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:42,823
Hiroshima. Ring a bell?

992
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:44,492
This is plan B?

993
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,202
Can I talk to you for a minute?

994
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,412
Not now, I'm busy.

995
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,416
Just a second. Please.

996
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:56,003
- Seriously, you're getting a little radical.
- What's radical?

997
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,757
Blowing a man's head off with
a fucking hand grenade is a touch much.

998
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,717
You got your way, I got mine.

999
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,387
I'm kind of glad you didn't want to talk.

1000
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,931
Let me just shoot him in the leg.
He'll talk.

1001
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:08,933
I want the whole package!

1002
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,601
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

1003
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,687
- I don't really care!
- What do you mean?

1004
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,105
What the fuck? You're a cop!

1005
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:18,275
I was a cop! But because of this dirtbag
and his friends, we're on the run!

1006
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:19,985
No. It's payback!

1007
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,445
That's enough! I mean it!

1008
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,615
- Is it?
- Oh, man, I heard about you.

1009
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:27,284
- Did you?
- I heard you were a Section 8.

1010
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:30,454
I didn't believe that sadistic bullshit
I heard you pulled...

1011
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,164
...but you're for real!

1012
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:36,001
If you don't want to get sticky,
get back...

1013
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:37,253
...Jack.

1014
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,506
You got it, sicko.

1015
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,970
You blew it, pal. This asshole's
out of control and I can't stop him.

1016
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:48,180
I'm not going down for this.

1017
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,725
- I'm out of here!
- Don't forget to write!

1018
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,395
You want my vote for the Psycho
Hall of Fame, asshole? You got it!

1019
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:58,190
You really do look like shit
in a ponytail.

1020
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,777
No. I'm sorry.

1021
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:04,029
Bye-bye, birdy. Bye, baby!

1022
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,198
I don't wanna hear it.

1023
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:09,618
Perret! The geezer you want
is Yves Perret!

1024
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:10,995
Who the hell is Perret?

1025
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:12,913
The bloke with me in prison.

1026
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,541
- Where's he now?
- The desert. Ryko Aifrield.

1027
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,001
Think he's telling the truth?

1028
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,003
It's not raining
and he's standing in a puddle.

1029
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:20,337
Disgusting.

1030
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:24,175
You just fell for the oldest routine
in the book. Bad cop...

1031
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:25,342
Worse cop!

1032
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:30,514
- Did you sleep with my sister?
- I don't believe you!

1033
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,933
- Did you two bump uglies with my sister?
- "Bump uglies. "

1034
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,228
- Did you?
- I was so drunk, I don't remember.

1035
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:38,189
Come on, worse cop, we're late.

1036
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,444
My little contribution to birth control.

1037
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,323
Bloody hell!

1038
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:52,828
Bloody dud.

1039
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:56,040
What about my sister?
It's a free country.

1040
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,292
What's that mean?
People are free.

1041
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,045
So?
So your sister is very free.

1042
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,713
I'm going to kill you.

1043
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,840
Okay, Owen, let's have it.

1044
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,643
- Oh, my...
- God!

1045
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,729
Double-armored, bulletproof glazing.

1046
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,732
120mm cannon on the driver's side.

1047
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,235
Transfer case has torque splitting.

1048
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:28,906
It'll see 60 in five and a half seconds
and pull high-tens in the quarter.

1049
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,616
What is that?

1050
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:35,913
That is an RV from hell. Care to join me?

1051
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,998
- What do you think?
- I'm impressed.

1052
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,292
- Very impressed?
- Very impressed.

1053
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:44,088
Does he have gray matter, or what?
Owen, gone! Home run!

1054
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:47,466
This thing will go through a brick wall.

1055
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:50,761
We are in business.
- Oh, yeah, we're in business.

1056
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,931
Do you know what kind of firepower
we're talking about here?

1057
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:57,476
This is a violent work of art!

1058
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,436
Who holds the pink slip? Satan?

1059
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,647
Why don't you take a look inside?

1060
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:05,776
Isn't this the same guy that invented
your exploding bazooka boots?

1061
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,863
Hey, Owen has milliseconds of genius,
believe me.

1062
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,072
What's this one do?

1063
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:13,033
Ultra-booster. It's nitrous oxide.

1064
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,827
Uh-huh. And what's that mean?

1065
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,787
What's the difference? We'll take it.

1066
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:20,875
No, you can't take that.
It's one of a kind, a prototype.

1067
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:24,044
Owen, trust us.
We won't put a scratch on it.

1068
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:25,713
Owen, we're fully insured.

1069
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,631
Fully insured?

1070
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,884
Run this guy Perret
through your computer.

1071
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:34,597
Okay. I'll see what I can dig up on him.

1072
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:37,641
- Cash?
- Yeah?

1073
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:38,934
Owen's not family, is he?

1074
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,478
Maybe.

1075
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:56,035
Ryko Airfield was abandoned 10 years ago.

1076
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,705
It s in private hands now.
There's been a lot of construction...

1077
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:03,500
...but look for a main building
about a mile in from the perimeter.

1078
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,336
Thanks, Owen.

1079
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:24,855
Looks quiet.

1080
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,778
This is insane.

1081
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,573
Very insane.

1082
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,619
You get the feeling
things are about to get bloody?

1083
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,539
They could.

1084
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:48,295
If one of us doesn't make it back,
I just want you to know that...

1085
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,631
...you're the best cop
I ever worked with.

1086
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,721
There's something
I want you to know, Ray.

1087
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,268
If you don't make it back and I do...

1088
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,063
...I am gonna date your sister.

1089
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,407
Look, Cash, I got nothing against you.

1090
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:23,497
But I don't want Catherine getting
that 2-in-the-morning phone call...

1091
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,666
...saying something's happened to you.

1092
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,086
If she has to live with that,
it would kill me.

1093
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:32,631
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
I'm charmed.

1094
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:39,263
I'll tell you what. I'll stay away...

1095
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,267
...until you give me your blessing.
Fair enough?

1096
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,394
In that case...

1097
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:47,438
...never.
- Thought so.

1098
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:51,108
Let's go to work.
Something's coming over the computer.

1099
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,944
It's Owen with that information on Perret.

1100
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,586
- We're at the location.
- Coming up on a very serious gate.

1101
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:13,338
- Is this place fortified?
- Don't know for sure.

1102
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,299
Better use extreme caution.

1103
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:16,884
- Cash?
- Yeah?

1104
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,218
Listen to the man.

1105
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,554
Yes, Mommy.

1106
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:27,269
Oh, my God!

1107
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,941
Subtle! Real subtle!

1108
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,193
We're in!

1109
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,742
Get the hell out of here!

1110
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:58,592
Come on.

1111
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,638
Where the hell are we?
It looks like a goddamn pit!

1112
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,318
Come on!

1113
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,531
Cash, watch the right!

1114
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:28,330
Your left!

1115
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,544
- I'm gonna go for it!
- Cash, no!

1116
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:34,753
- Yes!
- No!

1117
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:35,963
Yes!

1118
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,017
Subtle! Real subtle!

1119
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:50,519
Where'd you learn to drive?

1120
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:51,854
Stevie Wonder.

1121
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,277
- We're on fire!
- Yeah, we're cooking now!

1122
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,160
- It's a dead end!
- We're in a goddamn maze!

1123
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,750
- We're blocked in!
- This son of a bitch is playing with us!

1124
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:23,927
Oh, shit!

1125
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:28,807
Come on!

1126
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,559
Get the sons of bitches!

1127
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:42,404
- Do you want the good news or bad news?
- The bad.

1128
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:43,655
We're almost out of gas.

1129
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:48,035
- The good?
- We're almost out of gas.

1130
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,339
What's this guy own, a used-car lot?

1131
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:02,549
Come on!

1132
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:08,013
Bring them in!

1133
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:21,401
All right!
That's gotta be the last of them!

1134
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,070
Home team!

1135
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:25,072
- Behind you!
- What the hell is that?

1136
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,990
Not the Welcome Wagon!

1137
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:32,204
- We gotta bail!
- What was that noise?

1138
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,915
Don't worry, Owen. A few speed bumps!

1139
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:44,591
- Let's get out of here!
- I need a gun!

1140
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,593
You guys aren't holding out
on me, are you?

1141
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:49,263
- Here.
- Why is yours bigger than mine?

1142
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:50,931
Genetics, peewee.

1143
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:39,354
OwEN: Why aren't you guys
talking to me anymore? Say something.

1144
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,246
Perret's gotta be in there.

1145
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,874
Must be. It's the only building left standing.

1146
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,043
Any chance he might surrender?

1147
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:03,712
Not likely.

1148
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,672
Remember...

1149
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:07,674
...use extreme caution.

1150
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:10,719
Ciao.

1151
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:35,137
Nice collection.

1152
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:37,389
Yeah, toys for tots.

1153
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:40,350
No more owes-ies. We're even.

1154
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,727
How do you figure?
I just saved your life.

1155
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:44,396
We'll discuss it later.

1156
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:47,732
- Let them come, Mr. Perret.
- We are ready.

1157
01:30:58,703 --> 01:30:59,786
Bombs for tots.

1158
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:03,457
Facility destruct sequence...

1159
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:06,126
...is now engaged.
- Cash!

1160
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,045
This clock works backwards
or somebody activated a bomb.

1161
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,131
Yeah, wonder who.

1162
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:18,221
- How do we stop it?
- We don't. Let's get Perret.

1163
01:31:18,389 --> 01:31:20,682
Get me a toy too.

1164
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,851
Tango, we only got 11 minutes.

1165
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,811
Raiders scored three touchdowns
in 11 minutes.

1166
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,938
Yeah, but they had three time-outs.

1167
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:08,522
Clip.

1168
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:15,654
Look out!

1169
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:24,037
- You okay, Cash?
- Yeah, clean exit.

1170
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,665
You're lucky.
I've been shot plenty of times.

1171
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:28,291
I never felt lucky about it.

1172
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:30,168
Stop complaining.

1173
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:34,381
- Right side.
Got it.

1174
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,804
He has a hell of a hobby!
We got our own TV show.

1175
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:42,806
What do you think?

1176
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,558
I think we better get the hell out.

1177
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:47,936
Not yet. Game's just starting.

1178
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:51,398
Over here.

1179
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:55,777
Let her go!

1180
01:33:02,034 --> 01:33:03,535
All right, Requin.

1181
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:07,497
You want me? You got me.

1182
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,791
I got you both now, don't I?

1183
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,543
Two for the price of one.

1184
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:14,212
Pretty boy's trying to
get the drop on me.

1185
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:18,341
Drop your fucking gun
or I'll drop sister here!

1186
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:20,093
Drop your gun, Cash.

1187
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:21,886
I can take him.

1188
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,597
Cash!

1189
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:25,265
Drop your goddamn gun!

1190
01:33:25,516 --> 01:33:27,058
I drop it...

1191
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,061
...and we're both dead and you know it.

1192
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:33,356
If you don't drop it, we all go up.

1193
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:35,567
Recognize plan B?

1194
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:39,112
She fancies me.

1195
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:41,906
She might even lose her head over me.
Know what I mean?

1196
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:45,243
You don't know my mate here.

1197
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:47,996
He's looking forward
to kicking your brains in.

1198
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:49,497
Ain't you, Sonny?

1199
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:50,832
Well, pretty boy...

1200
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,543
...I'd like you to watch me...

1201
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,588
...pleasure your sister slow and easy.

1202
01:33:56,881 --> 01:34:00,175
But I only got a few minutes
to carve you up!

1203
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:54,229
We never talked about plan C, asshole.

1204
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:00,860
Think it's a dud?

1205
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:13,540
- FUBAR. Bigtime.
- We gotta find Catherine.

1206
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:20,797
When the Great Scorer comes
to write against your name, he'll mark...

1207
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:23,258
...not that you won or lost...

1208
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:25,719
...but how you played the game.

1209
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:27,595
What bullshit!

1210
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:30,515
- Shit!
- This game has cost me a lot.

1211
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:33,852
- I'll blow this maniac into the ozone.
- You gotta know which one he is.

1212
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:35,854
I do.

1213
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:38,022
I leave you with this thought, gentlemen.

1214
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:40,734
- Great. All you need now is a gun.
- Got it.

1215
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:43,778
So do I.

1216
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,948
All right, let's take him alive.

1217
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,825
- Kneecaps on three.
- Call it.

1218
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,326
One...

1219
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:53,997
Two!

1220
01:36:03,632 --> 01:36:06,009
- My sights are off.
- Mine too.

1221
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,511
Cash, get the door!

1222
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:11,055
Hurry up!

1223
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:16,644
- She all right?
- She's coming to.

1224
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:18,521
- How'd you know who to shoot?
- The ring.

1225
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:20,231
- No, the monogram.
- Monogram?

1226
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:21,483
It was reversed.

1227
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:24,027
- What about the ring?
- On the wrong hand.

1228
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:27,155
Are we clever or what?
Let's blow this place.

1229
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:37,916
20 seconds, Cash.

1230
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:08,696
There's a lot of new pollution
in the sky tonight and they call it Perret.

1231
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,491
Kiki, are you okay?

1232
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:14,410
Oh, yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just worried about you.

1233
01:37:14,578 --> 01:37:17,705
Thanks. I'll probably lose my arm
on account of saving him.

1234
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,916
Catherine, come on, it's a scratch.

1235
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,669
Cash, you got sloppy and stumbled.

1236
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:25,755
Sloppy? I took that hit for you!

1237
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:29,133
After all I've done for you,
you're still ungrateful.

1238
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:30,927
- Done for me?
Yeah.

1239
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:32,679
Guys, this is no time to argue.

1240
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,431
He just can't accept
that he's the number two cop.

1241
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:37,642
It's very hard for him to handle.

1242
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:41,521
Dream on.
You got your version, I got the truth.

1243
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:45,441
Why don't you just admit it,
that you guys work well together.

1244
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:48,403
No matter what you say, Ray...

1245
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:51,990
...I've at least earned the right
to date your sister.

1246
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:57,203
- Over my dead body.
- Deal?

1247
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:41,756
