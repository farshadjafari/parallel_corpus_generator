1
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,798
Hello?

2
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,802
Nancy?

3
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,822
exactly.

4
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,109
But at least
be honest about the facts.

5
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,361
That's what I知 saying.
Who's honest?

6
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,863
I'm honest.
Uh-huh.

7
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,330
I am honest about
what I write about.

8
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,867
I... I値l let you know
if it's autobiographical,

9
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,886
or if it's about me,
or if it's not.

10
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,836
And I find
autobiographical stories

11
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,873
at this juncture of my life
to be quite boring.

12
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,631
...say I知 one thing,
but actually you're another thing.

13
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,598
I think being true
to who you are is important.

14
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,636
I'm not saying you need to
be psychoanalytical
about the whole mess.

15
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,638
But don't be afraid.
Yeah, I...
but don't be afraid.

16
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,141
I had... I had lunch
with Jimmy Baldwin
the other day.

17
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:46,608
How is he?

18
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,109
He's a lovely man.

19
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,613
And he told me
the plot of his new book.

20
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,150
And he said to me,
"but I just want to make sure

21
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:56,653
it's not one of those
problem novels."

22
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,119
And I said, "Jimmy,

23
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,658
"your novel's about
a negro homosexual
who's in love with a Jew.

24
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,161
Well, wouldn't you call that
a problem?"

25
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,167
And he... and he looked at
and he laughed
because he knew I was right.

26
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:14,170
I'm saying, you know,
if you're gonna write
something like that,

27
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,172
at least be honest
why you're writing it.

28
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,640
Can't we just be honest?

29
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,677
Well, I don't think
you actually
need to be honest.

30
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,180
But don't come asking
some white man from the south

31
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:27,183
whether your book
about a black man
fucking some Jew,

32
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,687
when they're both
of the same sex,
is an issue!

33
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,153
Don't ask me that!

34
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,655
"Oh, no,
it's not an issue, Jimmy.

35
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,193
Everyone's gonna be-be-be
quite pleased
with that topic."

36
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:39,195
So how about you, Truman?
Do you admit it?

37
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,698
Well, I知 not nearly
that controversial.

38
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,201
I'm not! I'm not! I am not.

39
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,704
I'm not nearly
that controversial.

40
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:49,205
Oh, come on.

41
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,543
Hi. It's Truman
for William Shawn, please.

42
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,048
Have you read the, uh,
the article
about the killings in Kansas

43
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,516
in the front section
of the New York times?

44
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,554
Well, I think that's what
I want to write about.

45
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,561
I... I want to go tonight.

46
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,082
I figured you'd missed it.
I'm sorry.

47
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,086
That's all right.
I thought I was
heading to Kansas by myself.

48
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,055
God,
I知 glad you agreed to come.

49
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,558
You're the only one I know
with the qualifications

50
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,596
to be both a research assistant
and a personal bodyguard.

51
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:38,563
Thank you.

52
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,099
Now I知 nervous.

53
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,066
Yes?

54
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,604
Mr. Truman Capote
and miss Nelle Harper Lee?

55
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,070
That's us.

56
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,572
Where would you like
these, sir?

57
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,108
You can put that right the
between the doors.

58
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,610
What all did you bring?

59
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,111
Just a few things.

60
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,616
Thank you greatly, sir.
Thank you.

61
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,117
You're welcome.

62
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,083
Um...

63
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,620
it's an honor
to have you with us, sir,

64
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,088
and I hope
you won't mind me saying,

65
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,626
but I thought
your last book was
even better than the first.

66
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,127
Thank you.

67
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,631
I mean, just when you think
they've gotten as good
as they can get.

68
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,132
Thank you very much.

69
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,133
Ma'am.

70
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,142
You're pathetic.

71
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,646
What?
You paid him to say that.

72
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,650
You paid him to say that.

73
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,120
How did you know?

74
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,157
"Just when you think
they've gotten as
good as they can get"?

75
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,159
I thought that
was a good line.

76
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,663
Do you think
that was too much?

77
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:45,164
Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,139
Your keys.

79
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,176
Thank you.
Sign here, please.

80
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,240
Alvin Dewey,

81
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,244
Kansas bureau
of investigation.

82
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,747
K.B.I.

83
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,251
K.B.I.

84
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,208
Hi. I'm looking
for Alvin Dewey.

85
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,717
Hi.

86
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,719
Mr. Dewey.

87
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,721
Truman Capote,
from the New Yorker.

88
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,225
Bergdorf's.

89
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,727
Sorry?

90
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,246
The scarf.

91
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,506
Oh. Nice.

92
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,696
Thank you.

93
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,698
Mr. Dewey, I wonder
when we could

94
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,235
arrange an interview,
some time to talk.

95
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,740
Uh, about what?

96
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,743
Well, we're not looking
for any inside information.

97
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:05,745
You know, I don't care
one way or another

98
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,246
if you catch
whoever did this.

99
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,751
I'm writing an article
on how the clutter killings
are affecting the town.

100
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,253
You know,
how you all are bearing up.

101
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,756
I care.

102
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,226
Excuse me?
I care.

103
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,264
I care a great deal
if we catch whoever did this.

104
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,732
Oh, I see.

105
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,268
As do a lot of folks
around here.

106
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,235
Oh, of course.

107
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,737
Do you have press credentials?

108
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,273
What's a New Yorker?
Magazine.

109
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,740
Magazines don't give out...

110
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,277
you can come to
the news conference
with the rest of them.

111
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,779
Sears, roebuck.

112
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,282
The boy was 16?

113
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,248
He was 15.

114
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,250
Uh, Nancy was 16.

115
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,287
And it's her friend
that found them?

116
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,056
Uh, Laura Kinney.

117
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,756
Can you spell that?

118
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,294
Uh, I... I assume you're ok
with the Laura part.

119
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,563
K-I-N-N-E-Y.

120
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,065
But, uh, please, leave her be.

121
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,104
There's talk
of a bunch of Mexicans.
A whole bunch of Mexicans.

122
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,108
Hello, George.

123
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,576
It's good to see you again.

124
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,615
Uh, I do have an opinion
whether this was
the work of one man

125
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,617
or "a whole bunch,"
as you said,

126
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,085
but it doesn't
matter a whole lot

127
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,625
whether it was Mexicans
or Methodists or Eskimos.

128
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,093
We're gonna find
whoever did this.

129
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,131
Now, 4 good people
from our community are dead.

130
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,599
So let's remember that.

131
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,611
The west Kansas farm committee

132
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:40,554
is offering a $1,000 reward

133
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,092
for information
leading to an arrest.

134
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,593
Please print that.

135
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,098
And thank you all for coming.

136
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:02,862
He was... he was foxy
with that old man.

137
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,868
Hmm.

138
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,874
This make you miss Alabama?

139
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,376
Not even a little bit.

140
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,628
You lie.

141
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't lie.

142
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,129
Good morning.

143
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,130
Hi.

144
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,634
Can any of you tell me
where I壇 find Laura Kinney?

145
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,143
Is that her? With the boy?

146
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,145
Yeah, with Danny burke.

147
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,146
Danny burke?

148
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,647
Laura?

149
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,155
Thank you.

150
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,109
Truman.

151
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,614
I'm gonna find out
where that girl lives.

152
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,616
Can I do that alone?

153
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,620
All right?

154
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,622
Ok.

155
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,636
I think I scared a friend
of yours this morning.

156
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,139
She came looking for you
when I was writing.

157
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,140
You hate my friends.

158
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:19,907
No, I wouldn't say "hate."

159
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,444
Just as long as they don't
knock on my door.

160
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,449
I saw the bodies today.

161
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,917
Which?

162
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,418
The clutters.

163
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,459
I... I looked
inside the coffins.

164
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,963
That's horrifying.

165
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,749
It comforts me.

166
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,254
Something so horrifying...

167
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,755
it's, uh,

168
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,757
it's a relief.

169
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,145
Normal life falls away.

170
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,149
But then, I was never
much for normal life.

171
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:02,616
No.

172
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,653
Yeah, people here
won't talk to me.

173
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,120
They, uh, hmm,

174
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:10,159
they want someone like you,
like, uh, like Nelle.

175
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,992
Me, they hate.

176
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,530
I can't think of
a single quality
I share with Nelle.

177
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:15,496
Weli...

178
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,032
maybe manliness.

179
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,002
Good morning, Henry.

180
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,539
Good morning, sir.

181
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,042
Let's go.

182
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,044
Bye.

183
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,305
Hi, Danny. I'm Harper Lee.

184
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,816
Nancy was your best friend?

185
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,820
Yeah, she was my best friend.

186
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,823
How has Danny been?

187
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,327
Pretty shattered.

188
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,830
Nothing terrible has ever
happened to him before.

189
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:07,850
Danny was the last one
at the house that night.

190
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,801
That's why Mr. Dewey
keeps interviewing him.

191
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,839
They don't think that he had
anything to do with it.

192
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:16,807
It's just to see
if he remembers
anything unusual.

193
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,346
People in town do seem
to wonder if he was involved.

194
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,316
Yeah. That's been
really hard for Danny.

195
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,355
Oh, it's the hardest
when someone
has a notion about you

196
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,358
and it's impossible
to convince them otherwise.

197
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,362
Ever since I was a child,
folks have thought
they had me pegged

198
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:39,365
because of the way I...

199
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,867
the way I am.

200
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,370
You know, the way I talk.

201
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,872
And they're always wrong.

202
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,376
You know what I mean?

203
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,380
Yeah.

204
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,385
I wanna show you something.

205
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,786
Maybe this will give you,
um, a better picture
of what happened.

206
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:18,787
Oh...

207
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,539
what is this?

208
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:21,755
It's your diary.

209
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,294
"Danny here tonight
and we watched TV.

210
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,796
"So nice just
having him sit with us.

211
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,798
"Left at 11:00.

212
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,303
P.s. He's the only one
I really love."

213
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,807
And that was that.

214
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,127
Did Laura say "shattered"?

215
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:52,036
Uh, "pretty shattered.

216
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,573
Nothing terrible has ever
happened to him before."

217
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,579
You know I have 94% recall
of all conversations?

218
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:01,545
94%?

219
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,582
I've tested myself.

220
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:04,583
Hmm.

221
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,093
Weli...

222
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,061
how did that happen?

223
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,100
Apparently
detective Foxy's wife,
uh, has read fiction.

224
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,602
That's great.

225
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
We're in.

226
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,107
We are in.
In.

227
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,090
You came.
Hi.

228
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
Thank you for having us.

229
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:48,627
Thank you.

230
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,045
Get yourselves in here.

231
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,584
Alvin, get your pants on.
They're here.

232
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,085
Hey, little Deweys.
Hi.

233
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,086
Hi.

234
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:00,139
Shake it with your wrist.

235
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
Use your whole arm.

236
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,610
More.

237
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,648
You think I知 kidding around,
but I知 serious.

238
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:10,649
Mama would've put in
half the bottle.

239
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,901
She had to buy it
by the crate.

240
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:14,653
Alvin's gonna hate this.

241
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,155
I have to stop.

242
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
Oh, I cannot believe
you're from New Orleans.

243
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,042
I miss it so much.

244
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,580
Well, I only lived there
for a short while,

245
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,582
but my mama
was born and bred.

246
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,551
You know something?

247
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,588
Alvin pretends
he doesn't know who you are,

248
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:34,590
but the minute
you came to town,

249
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,056
he read your books.
No!

250
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,595
He had one of his men pick up
breakfast at tiffany's
in Kansas city

251
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,097
'cause it's banned
in the library here.

252
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,602
And he said, "I feel
like you're spiting me."

253
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:52,608
I said... I said,
"do you think I took
this job to spite you?"

254
00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:00,115
I was writing the script
as they were filming,
all that time in Italy

255
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,082
and I壇 work like mad
all day long

256
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,120
and then dash down to the ba
around midnight

257
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:07,087
to hand in
the next day's scenes.

258
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,626
And Humphrey had just about
moved into the hotel bar...

259
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:11,592
Humphrey Bogart.

260
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,629
...where he and john...

261
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:14,897
john Huston.

262
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:16,096
...had, uh...

263
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,048
they drank every night.

264
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,087
And I mean drank,
you know, like
famished water buffaloes.

265
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,555
Weli...

266
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,842
I壇 only just handed them
the final scene

267
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:29,094
when the bellhop told
me I had a phone call.

268
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,348
And it was my stepfather,
Joe Capote,

269
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:36,101
calling to say
that my mother had died.

270
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,607
I... I flew home to New York,
terribly distraught...

271
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,110
but when I got
to the apartment,

272
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:50,115
I could see
that Joe was in even
worse shape than I was.

273
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,118
He grabbed my hand
and he said to me,

274
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,120
"talk.

275
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,128
Talk about anything.
"You know?

276
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,598
"I mean,
any subject in the world.

277
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,636
"Don't worry whether
it'll interest me or not.

278
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,137
"Just talk...

279
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,141
so I won't break down."

280
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:21,146
He couldn't bear to be alone
with his thoughts.

281
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,649
It was too painful.

282
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,662
It's been a hard
couple of weeks for Alvin.

283
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,165
He and herb clutter
were good friends from church.

284
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,166
Oh, Marie.

285
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,169
Oh, come on, Alvin.
These are good people.

286
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:17,202
Why would they put a pillow
under the boy's head
just to shoot him?

287
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,215
Why would they tuck Nancy in?

288
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,722
So many of my friends
would love to meet you.

289
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,188
Oh, that'd be fine.

290
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,690
You don't have to worry,

291
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,728
'cause I知 not going
to write about this
till everything's over.

292
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,229
Well, I知 not worried.

293
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,982
I know what room
you're in at the hotel,

294
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,234
and I know where you live
in Brooklyn.

295
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:55,573
oh, god.

296
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,791
You're celebrating.

297
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:00,328
Uh, well,
remember Nelle's manuscript
she sent me in New York?

298
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:03,331
Yeah. Mockingbird.
Killing a mockingbird.

299
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:05,834
You said it was good.

300
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:07,300
And I was right.

301
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,838
She just heard Lippincott
wants to publish it.

302
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:16,344
Well, Jesus.

303
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,848
Jesus, well,
that's... that's terrific.

304
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,349
Tell her
congratulations from me.

305
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,118
Congratulations.

306
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,853
Thank you.
Jealous.

307
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:27,355
Will you be home
by Christmas?

308
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:29,289
I... I wanna come home.

309
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,326
I wanna come home.
I do. I just...

310
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,329
thought if they catch
whoever did this,
who knows what?

311
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:35,831
I'll probably be here
till next Christmas.

312
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:37,833
I'm gonna let you go.

313
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,352
I... I, uh...

314
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:40,836
no, don't go. Um,

315
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,338
we'll go away
next spring to write.

316
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,305
Maybe Spain.
Yeah.

317
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,842
Ok, I知 gonna let you go.

318
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:48,809
Jack...

319
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,311
Jack, I promise.
Mm-hmm.

320
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,849
We'll go away
this spring to write.
Maybe Spain.

321
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:54,850
Ok.

322
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,853
All right.

323
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,361
My wife worked there, too.

324
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,698
What did she do in the house?

325
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,201
Cleaning.
Cooking a little bit.

326
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,064
Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.

327
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,034
"Girdle up. No extra bulges.

328
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,537
"If you're dressed right,
when he gets home,

329
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,575
"the rest of the evening
should be smooth sailing.

330
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,043
Bon voyage, gals."

331
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,581
I can't believe
you got that whole page.
I only read it once.

332
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,083
I've tested my...
tested myself.

333
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,085
I have 94%...
percent recall.

334
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,088
Cut that out.
Cut that out.

335
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,357
Cut that...

336
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,594
Cut...

337
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,061
cut that out.

338
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,598
Isn't that something, Alvin?

339
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh, it's impressive.

340
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,102
Thank you.

341
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,118
I'm sorry. He's upset.

342
00:25:37,153 --> 00:25:38,887
What's he upset about?

343
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:40,622
They know who did it.

344
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,624
2 men.

345
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,627
You know, they passed
through Kansas city last week
writing bad checks.

346
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:48,630
By the time
Alvin's boys got up there,
they were gone.

347
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:50,131
Skipped out.
Oh!

348
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,634
Yeah. They... they don't know
where.

349
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,101
No idea.

350
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:59,641
One of them had a cellmate
who gave him up
for the $1,000 reward.

351
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:02,411
Do they know
the name of the cellmate?

352
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:05,111
No. No, I don't know.
Alvin knows.

353
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,149
I guess this isn't
the appropriate time
to go ask him.

354
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,152
He's beside himself.

355
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,661
Hello?

356
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,164
Alvin, get in here.

357
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,168
Dad, it's the telephone.

358
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:28,670
Not now, Alvin.

359
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,672
God damn it.

360
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,676
Get over here.

361
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,643
Dad!

362
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,680
Alvin, not now.

363
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,684
Sit.

364
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,162
Dad? Dad?

365
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,701
You need to call
the chief of police
in Las Vegas.

366
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,671
Alvin, what'd you say?

367
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,708
He said you need to
call them immediately.

368
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,590
Truman Capote.

369
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,723
Dorothy Sanderson.

370
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,760
I figured you'd be
left alone this morning

371
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,177
by that hardworking
husband of yours,

372
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:28,133
so I have breakfast,
and I have news,
and I have literature.

373
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:30,635
My friend, Jack, mailed me
that book you wanted

374
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,138
and I inscribed it myself.

375
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,776
"To the maiden of the midwest,
the priestess of the plains,

376
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:41,780
the queen of the kitchen,
my first novel. Truman."

377
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,284
You're too much. Come on in.

378
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,251
Oh, thank you.

379
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,122
Go into the living room.
Have a seat.

380
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,627
Let me get that.
It's been ringing all morning.

381
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,631
Hello?

382
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,008
Truman, I meant in here.

383
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,010
That's the women's cell.

384
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:51,049
It's hardly ever used,
but they wanted them separate.

385
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:52,550
Let's sit in the living room.

386
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,531
They put you
in the women's cell.

387
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,326
Do you have any aspirin?

388
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:20,328
My legs.

389
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,331
Truman?

390
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:25,833
Please.

391
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:32,840
I'm sorry.

392
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,199
In the matter of

393
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,486
the state of Kansas.
Richard Eugene Hickock

394
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:47,453
and Perry Edward Smith,

395
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:51,457
this court has been informed
by counsel, Mr. Weeks,

396
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,996
that the defendants
wish to waive their right
to a preliminary hearing.

397
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,465
His mind is somewhere else.

398
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,503
Mr. Hickock,
is that your wish?

399
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,257
Yes, sir.

400
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,294
Why are they doing that?

401
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,797
Mr. Smith.

402
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,807
I... I ask that
the waiver be effectuated.

403
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,809
"Effectuated"?

404
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:26,311
So noted.

405
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,325
Remove the prisoners.

406
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,340
Was it your choice
to waive the hearing?

407
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,848
Do you still need some?

408
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,854
Give me your hand.

409
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,372
I could kill you
if you got too close.

410
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,388
Now, would you
like some water,
or...

411
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,400
Mrs. Sanderson
lent you my book.

412
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,413
He said we'd curry
favor with the judge

413
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,416
if we waived our rights.

414
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,418
Who did?

415
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,920
The lawyer.

416
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,736
Your picture's undignified.

417
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,239
People recall
first impressions.

418
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,741
Oh,

419
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,744
what's been your
first impression?

420
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,253
Hello.

421
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,230
Mr. Shawn.
Truman.

422
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:52,672
I'm writing a book.

423
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,709
It... it's too much
for a single article.

424
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,962
This town, the...
the killers most of all.

425
00:34:57,997 --> 00:35:00,715
Uh, you will be stunned
by Perry Smith.

426
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,181
Why, what's happening?

427
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:04,218
Well, not much yet,
but I know.

428
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:05,985
I... I can sense him.

429
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,023
He... he's desperately lonely,
uh, frightened.

430
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,525
I have a question.

431
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,026
Are you ready?

432
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,528
Would it matter?

433
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:14,494
Uh, no.

434
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,498
How much more money
can you send me?

435
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,535
And... and how quickly
could you get Dick Avedon

436
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,537
out here to take
some pictures?

437
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,795
Who are you smiling at
right now?

438
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,762
I'm smilin' at you.

439
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,800
You know,
Dick's a very famous
fashion photographer.

440
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,302
World-famous.

441
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,806
Am I gonna be
in a fashion magazine?

442
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,310
So there's no worry
of having a bad picture.

443
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,818
Who were you closer to,
your mom or your dad?

444
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:55,820
What's that?
Who were you closer to,

445
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:56,821
your mom or your dad?

446
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:58,089
Well, both.

447
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,323
Yeah?
Yeah.

448
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,325
Have you talked to them?

449
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,326
Yeah.

450
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,829
Who'd you talk to first?

451
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,837
Perry, honey,
you look terrific, baby.

452
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,307
That was good.

453
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,845
Can you show us the tattoo
on your chest then?

454
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,346
Yeah.

455
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,146
Where did Perry
get the art set?

456
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:18,519
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

457
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,023
Yes, sir.

458
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:24,825
Defendants, rise.

459
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,798
Perry Edward Smith
and Richard Eugene Hickock,

460
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:38,339
you stand accused
of 4 counts of the crime
of murder in the first degree.

461
00:37:38,374 --> 00:37:40,341
Have you reached
a unanimous verdict?

462
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,342
We have, your honor.

463
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:43,844
What is your verdict?

464
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,347
Guilty on all 4 counts.

465
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,972
Have you unanimously
reached a sentence?

466
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,726
We have, your honor.

467
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,478
What is the sentence?

468
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,945
Death.

469
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,833
I need to see him
before we go.

470
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,340
Perry.

471
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,344
They're going to transfer you
up to lansing today.

472
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:37,348
And you'll have to make sure
to put me
on the visitors list.

473
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,351
Otherwise I can't see you.

474
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,856
I'm going to help
find you a proper lawyer.

475
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,864
You need a serious lawyer
for an appeal.

476
00:38:57,284 --> 00:39:00,753
Now they took Dick last night.

477
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:04,291
And I need you to get him
to do the same thing

478
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,794
and just put me
on the visitors list.

479
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,458
And I thought,
"where does the family eat?"

480
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:38,924
You know?

481
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,961
I mean, does he,
like, reach his hand
through the bars

482
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:43,464
and have dinner with everyone
around the table?

483
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:48,469
Nelle, kudos on, um...
kill the bird, is it?

484
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:49,935
That's... that's close.
Thank you.

485
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,972
That's marvelous.
Who's your publisher?

486
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:52,938
Lippincott.

487
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,940
Yes. It's a children's book
right?

488
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,477
Yes.
No, no. It's...
it's about children.

489
00:39:56,512 --> 00:39:57,978
Yes.
Yes, I致e heard
a lot about it.

490
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,445
Good.
Congratulations.

491
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,981
Thank you.
I didn't even know
she wrote.

492
00:40:01,016 --> 00:40:02,983
He's sad and he's shy.

493
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,951
And he's terrified.

494
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:10,456
They shotgunned
the entire family
in the face.

495
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,494
And I thought, at first,
"mmm, I知 gonna be
scared of these men.

496
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,246
I'm gonna run,
run, run right home."

497
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,499
Actually, the brother
in the family...

498
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,503
Kenyon is his name,

499
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,005
they had placed a pillow
under his head,

500
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,259
and then shot him
point-blank in the face.

501
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,513
Almost as if they were
putting him to sleep

502
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,014
and then shot him.

503
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,020
This is the start of
a great love affair.

504
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:42,988
Yeah. Truman
in love with Truman.

505
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,527
The book I知 writing
will return him
to the realm of humanity.

506
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,030
It's the book I was
always meant to write.

507
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,787
Well, he hasn't actually
written a word of it yet,

508
00:40:56,822 --> 00:41:00,541
but he says
it's the nonfiction book
of the decade,

509
00:41:00,576 --> 00:41:02,042
so...

510
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,545
so...

511
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,048
what have you been doing?

512
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,054
And I値l tell you,

513
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,559
I was in Marilyn痴
apartment just last week,
talking about movies, art.

514
00:41:18,594 --> 00:41:20,828
Finally I had to
break it to her that

515
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:23,063
of the 4 matisses
hanging on her wall,

516
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:25,065
2 were upside down.

517
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,535
Can I have another, please?

518
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,573
To answer your question,
I知 following
breakfast at tiffany's

519
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,040
by blazing a different path.

520
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,579
By inventing an entirely
new kind of writing.

521
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,581
The nonfiction novel.

522
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,833
You have a subject?
Yes.

523
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,550
On the night of November 14,

524
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,087
2 men broke into
a quiet farmhouse in Kansas

525
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,840
and murdered an entire family.

526
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,057
Now, why did they do that?

527
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,595
2 worlds exist
in this country.

528
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:59,099
The quiet, conservative life,
and the life of those 2 men.

529
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:02,102
The underbelly.
The criminally violent.

530
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,606
And those worlds converged
that bloody night.

531
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,573
Now, I spent the past 3 months

532
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,611
interviewing
everyone in Kansas
touched by that violence.

533
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,113
Now I spent hours
talking to the killers

534
00:42:13,148 --> 00:42:15,080
and I値l spend more.

535
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,584
'Cause researching this work
has changed my life.

536
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,122
You know,
it's altered my point of view
about almost everything.

537
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,590
Yeah.

538
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,128
And I think those who read it
will be similarly affected.

539
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,115
So you find them
a new lawyer.

540
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,620
Well, they're facing
execution in 6 weeks.

541
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,659
You know, they need
someone to argue
whether or not that's right.

542
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,129
Ok.

543
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,667
And I壇 also like to
see them alive.

544
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,635
Weli...
yeah.

545
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,172
Yeah, I need to
hear their stories.

546
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,177
Well, just be careful
what you do to
get what you want.

547
00:43:17,212 --> 00:43:18,644
I...

548
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,647
I知 finding them a lawyer.

549
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,183
Truman, you're
finding yourself a lawyer.

550
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:25,185
No, I知 finding them
a lawyer.

551
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,189
There's a difference.

552
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:56,717
The Warden will see you now.

553
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,723
Well, we do all right
by our boys.
Hmm.

554
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,691
Showers once a week.
Feed them good.

555
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,229
We'll be feeding Perry Smith
in the infirmary soon
if he don't eat.

556
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,481
Try and get the food in
through his arm.

557
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,233
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

558
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:15,753
Well,
he hasn't eaten in a month.

559
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:18,238
It ain't his right
to kill himself.

560
00:44:18,273 --> 00:44:20,007
It's the right of the people.

561
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:21,707
The people of this state.

562
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,744
And that's who I work for,
the people.

563
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,746
No one told me.

564
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,247
Yeah, he won't eat.

565
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,751
Uh-huh.

566
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,003
When can I see him?

567
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,254
Well, let me see.

568
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,761
How about you coming 3:00,
Thursday afternoon?

569
00:44:40,796 --> 00:44:41,762
No.

570
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,729
Um...

571
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,265
that's no good.

572
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,732
I...

573
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,234
I need to see them now.

574
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:53,238
Then... then whenever I want,
for as long as I want.

575
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:57,277
Well, that's just not
how we do things
around here, Mr. Capote.

576
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,747
Yeah, I understand
what a burden

577
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,285
unlimited visitation might be
on this institution

578
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,789
and on the people
who pay for it.

579
00:45:08,824 --> 00:45:10,756
And I want to be clear

580
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,794
that I don't expect
the citizens
of Leavenworth county

581
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,296
to have to
shoulder that burden.

582
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,305
This is to be dispensed
as you see fit.

583
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,822
You know, I didn't know
where to count your boy
at first,

584
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:43,824
him being half-Indian.

585
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,791
But I did him a favor.

586
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,327
I counted him as a white man.

587
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,332
Uh-huh. You're a kind
and generous man.

588
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:53,834
Spread your feet.

589
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,844
This way.

590
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,357
Hey, hey.

591
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:18,358
Yeah, hello.

592
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,362
Hey,
thanks a lot for your help
with the lawyer.

593
00:46:22,397 --> 00:46:23,864
Oh, that's fine.

594
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,870
Wow, you must be
really desperate for a story
to come all the way out here.

595
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,376
You want to go
see Perry, go ahead.

596
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,343
Thank you.

597
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,212
You want my advice,
though, Mr. Capote,

598
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:43,250
he's just trying to prove
the insanity defense.

599
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:28,128
It's ok.

600
00:47:43,644 --> 00:47:44,645
It's ok.

601
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:49,650
It's Truman.
It's your friend.

602
00:47:54,154 --> 00:47:55,155
It's ok.

603
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,144
This is before she had us.

604
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,397
Before she started drinking.

605
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,401
Who took care of you
as a child?

606
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,404
Orphanage.

607
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,407
Me and Linda.

608
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,409
And that's your sister?

609
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,923
You know,
we're not so different
as you might think.

610
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:13,927
Yeah, I was abandoned
repeatedly as a child.

611
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:24,187
My mama would drag me along
to some new town,

612
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:28,407
so she could take up
with another man she'd met.

613
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,446
Night after night,
she'd lock me
in the hotel room alone.

614
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,949
Mama would turn the latch
and tell the staff

615
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:37,951
not to let me out
no matter what.

616
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,457
And I was terrified.

617
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,963
And I壇 scream my head off...

618
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,435
until finally I壇 collapse

619
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,974
on the carpet
next to the door
and I壇 fall asleep.

620
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,480
Then after years of this,

621
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:08,447
she just left me

622
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,985
with relatives in Alabama.

623
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,490
Who raised you up?

624
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,493
My aunts.

625
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,963
And that's where I met Nelle.

626
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,001
And she lived...
she lived next door.

627
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,010
Your mother was Indian?

628
00:51:37,045 --> 00:51:39,478
Cherokee.

629
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,516
So drinking was not
a good thing for her.

630
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,519
No tolerance for it.

631
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,033
We're on, uh, suicide watch.

632
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,037
That's why they leave
the lights on at night.

633
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,540
I hope
we're past that now.

634
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:07,541
I do.

635
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,555
Be careful of Ricardo.

636
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,059
I think he wants you
all to himself.

637
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:27,526
All right.

638
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,563
But he's
naturally mendacious.

639
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,566
Not to be trusted.

640
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,069
If he had $100,
he'd steal a stick
of chewing gum.

641
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,583
Perry,
I want to take
your notebooks with me.

642
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,587
I want to read them.

643
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,091
If I leave here
without understanding you,

644
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,596
the world will see you
as a monster

645
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,097
always.

646
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,102
I don't want that.

647
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,128
'Cause he trusts me.

648
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,464
I mean,
that's why he gave it to me.

649
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:41,968
And he-he's given me
absolutely everything.

650
00:53:42,003 --> 00:53:45,972
And he wants so badly
to be taken seriously

651
00:53:46,007 --> 00:53:48,475
to be held in some esteem.

652
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,476
Do you?

653
00:53:49,511 --> 00:53:50,942
Do I what?

654
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,480
Do you hold him
in esteem, Truman?

655
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:56,983
Well,

656
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,987
he's a gold mine.

657
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,492
And he's told me
his entire life.

658
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:06,993
His, uh,

659
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,960
his dead mother.

660
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,998
Uh, he had a brother
and a sister kill themselves.

661
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,500
Awful.

662
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,003
Did you tell him
your mama did the same thing?

663
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:18,505
See, I can't tell him
everything.

664
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,508
We've been
talking our heads off
for the past month.

665
00:54:21,543 --> 00:54:23,510
And sometimes when I...

666
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,516
when I think how good
my book can be,
I can hardly breathe.

667
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,525
Anyway, th-this is...
this is what I wanted
to read to you.

668
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,526
Uh,

669
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,778
"if called upon
to make a speech..."

670
00:54:41,813 --> 00:54:43,530
"if called upon
to make a speech"?

671
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,033
I mean, this is exactly
what I知 talking about.

672
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,788
A speech, just in case
he's ever recognized
for an achievement.

673
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:56,042
"I can't remember
what I was going to say
for the life of me.

674
00:54:56,077 --> 00:54:58,044
"I don't think ever
before have so many people

675
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,011
"been so directly responsible

676
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,514
"for my being
so very, very glad.

677
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,051
"It's a wonderful moment
and a rare one.

678
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,019
Thank you!"

679
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,557
There's... there's an
exclamation point at
the end of that "thank you"

680
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,559
in case you didn't catch it.

681
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,564
Where'd you go?

682
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,069
I guess it
stopped being funny.

683
00:55:23,104 --> 00:55:25,071
I... I never said it was.

684
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,074
But, wait,
listen to this.

685
00:55:29,861 --> 00:55:31,042
I was 14.

686
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,581
One day I said to him,
"mom's dead."
I could see it.

687
00:55:34,616 --> 00:55:36,350
A week later we got the news.

688
00:55:36,385 --> 00:55:37,735
She finally drunk
herself...

689
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,085
...found her shivering...

690
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,588
she hit me so many times
with that flashlight,

691
00:55:41,623 --> 00:55:43,089
she broke it.

692
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,591
That night, I...
I dreamed about
that big yellow bird.

693
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,593
Clawed that nun's eyes,
bright like the sun.

694
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:48,560
Lifted me to the sky.

695
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,598
Sometimes you see a thing
how it really is.

696
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,107
Well, you're nothing
if not hardworking.

697
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:03,109
Hey, you look good.
Healthy again.

698
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:10,116
You know, I致e decided
on a title for my book.

699
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,303
I think you'll like it.

700
00:56:13,338 --> 00:56:14,988
It's very masculine.

701
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:17,490
In cold blood.

702
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:19,993
Isn't that good?

703
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,463
And that refers to the crime

704
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,966
or the fact that
you're still talking
to the criminals?

705
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,472
Oh, the former,
among other things.

706
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:34,974
I see.

707
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,447
I wanted to ask

708
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:46,486
if you'd let me look
at your investigation notes.

709
00:56:46,521 --> 00:56:49,454
That lawyer you helped find
for your friends

710
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,492
got them a hearing at
the Kansas supreme court...

711
00:56:52,527 --> 00:56:53,958
yeah, I heard this morning.

712
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,496
...on the issue
of inadequate counsel.

713
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,969
Alvin,

714
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:09,008
I mean,
do you not want me
to look at your notes?

715
00:57:09,043 --> 00:57:11,010
You are permitted to say no.

716
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,437
I'll tell you what.

717
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,440
If those boys get off,

718
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,943
I知 coming to Brooklyn
to hunt you down.

719
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,913
I have to be in court
at 9:00,

720
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,952
but you call Roy Church
and he'll show you
what you want to see.

721
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,458
Thank you.

722
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,843
It's as much for me
as for anyone.

723
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,631
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you so soon.

724
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:52,350
We're gonna be able
to use your book
for our case.

725
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,388
You... you'll write
we never got to raise
an insanity plea.

726
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,893
You wrote how terrible
the lawyers was.

727
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,398
I... I haven't written
a word yet.

728
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,409
What have you been doing?

729
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,413
Research. Talking to you.

730
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,885
All right.

731
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,886
I... I had hoped...

732
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,422
wh-what are you calling it?

733
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,426
The book?

734
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,430
I have no idea.

735
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,902
Perry,

736
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,404
if I知 going to
write about you,

737
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:50,944
if I知 going to determine
how to write about you,

738
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,947
we need to talk about,

739
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,950
you know, why you're here.

740
00:58:58,952 --> 00:58:59,953
And,

741
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,956
you know, the murders,

742
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:05,423
and that night

743
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,960
at the clutter house.

744
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,972
Do you worry
what I値l think?

745
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:20,473
Is that it?

746
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,979
Dick says you know
Elizabeth Taylor.

747
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,983
I know a lot of people.

748
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,494
Perry, I have invitations
to be in morocco, Greece,

749
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,999
and I prefer to be here

750
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:47,500
with you.

751
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,261
Jack, be patient with me.

752
00:59:58,296 --> 01:00:01,479
I'm just missing
this one piece.

753
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,481
Well, how long
is that gonna take?

754
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,019
Why don't you just
try leaving him alone
for a while?

755
01:00:06,054 --> 01:00:07,986
Come to Spain.

756
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,023
You can always
visit him later.

757
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:11,990
I don't know.

758
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,028
Well, I知 off.
I'm just... I致e got
my own writing to do.

759
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:18,298
Well, do it in Brooklyn.
Wait for me.

760
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:21,499
There's too many
people around. I've...

761
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,536
I値l leave the address
on the kitchen table.

762
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,042
Well,
think about what I said,
and join me when you can.

763
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,010
I will.

764
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,046
I will.
Ok?

765
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,547
Bye.

766
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,572
Hi.

767
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:23,546
Truman.

768
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,549
We never intended
on killing that family.

769
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,551
Capote,

770
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,054
will you get that straight
in your book, please?

771
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:33,056
No premeditation.

772
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,308
What are you doing?

773
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:37,060
I have to fly back east.

774
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,562
When?

775
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:43,316
An hour.
I miss you already.

776
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:46,034
Write me every 5 minutes.

777
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:49,072
Hey, you know,
we never did intend
on killing that family.

778
01:01:49,107 --> 01:01:50,073
Capote?

779
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,575
Capote?

780
01:02:38,037 --> 01:02:39,003
What?

781
01:02:39,038 --> 01:02:40,540
Truman,

782
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,543
I致e not been
able to tear myself
away from your book.

783
01:02:44,544 --> 01:02:46,511
It's that good.

784
01:02:46,546 --> 01:02:48,513
It's... it's not good,
it's astonishing.

785
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:51,551
This first half
is astonishing.
Oh, thank you.

786
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:53,518
When will you be done,
do you think?

787
01:02:53,553 --> 01:02:56,556
Yes, I... I知 already
well into the third part.

788
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:58,022
But I...

789
01:02:58,057 --> 01:03:00,810
I can't finish that
till I convince Perry

790
01:03:00,845 --> 01:03:03,955
to describe the night
of the killings to me.

791
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:07,066
I was... I was planning
to visit this fall, see?

792
01:03:07,101 --> 01:03:09,068
Then I think you need
to talk to him now.

793
01:03:09,569 --> 01:03:13,322
And we all need to see
how this ends
for the final part.

794
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:17,076
I... I... I can't finish the book
till I know what happens.

795
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:20,580
If Perry and Dick
are executed, it's one thing.

796
01:03:20,615 --> 01:03:22,046
And if not, weli...

797
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:24,083
Truman,
you've got your ending.

798
01:03:24,118 --> 01:03:25,049
I really don't know.

799
01:03:25,084 --> 01:03:27,587
The Kansas court
denied their appeal.

800
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:30,089
It came over the wire
on Friday.

801
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:33,593
I mean, you need to
talk to Perry now.

802
01:03:33,628 --> 01:03:36,095
He'll be dead by September.

803
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:42,101
I mean, I知 sorry.
I know how much you've come
to care about him.

804
01:03:46,606 --> 01:03:49,073
Right. Yes, right.

805
01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:53,112
So I want to set up
a reading for you
in the fall, in New York,

806
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,114
and, uh, well,
we'll build some interest,

807
01:03:55,149 --> 01:03:57,116
and we'll publish
in the fall.

808
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,434
Thank god.
There's nothing in the house.

809
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,354
Why aren't you working?

810
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,774
Well, I knew
you couldn't be counted on
to stock the kitchen.

811
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,778
What are we going to feed
our famous guest?

812
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,783
Oh, Jesus,
I completely forgot.

813
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,786
Plus, I, uh,
finished my novel yesterday.

814
01:04:34,654 --> 01:04:35,988
What?

815
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,589
When was the last time
you wrote to him?

816
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,591
I don't know.

817
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,062
What's this?

818
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,983
It's a letter for Truman
I was asked to deliver.

819
01:05:04,018 --> 01:05:05,484
It's from Perry.

820
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,904
Let's have it.

821
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,632
"Dear friend Truman,
where are you?

822
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,670
"Read this item
in a medical dictionary.

823
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,675
'Death by hanging
is caused by asphyxia,

824
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,678
'by fracture of
the cervical vertebrae,

825
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,930
'by laceration
of the trachea.'

826
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,884
"Not too comforting,
as we lost our appeal.

827
01:05:39,885 --> 01:05:41,387
"Missing you.

828
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,273
"Alone and desirous
of your presence.

829
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,743
Your amigo, Perry."

830
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,781
Mr. Shawn told me
about the court
decision yesterday.

831
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,785
I was wondering why you were
in such a good mood.

832
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:59,155
That's
a terrible thing to say.

833
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,659
I... I write him all the time
I致e just...

834
01:06:03,694 --> 01:06:06,662
I致e been so focused on-
- on the book lately.

835
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,896
So Jack thinks
I知 using Perry,

836
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:30,436
but he also thinks
I fell in love with him
when I was in Kansas.

837
01:06:30,471 --> 01:06:33,939
Now, how both of those things
can be true is beyond me.

838
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,941
Thank you.

839
01:06:39,445 --> 01:06:41,947
Well, did you?

840
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:43,949
Did you fall in love
with him?

841
01:06:46,452 --> 01:06:47,953
I don't know
how to answer that.

842
01:06:47,988 --> 01:06:49,455
Truman.

843
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:55,961
It's as if
Perry and I grew up
in the same house,

844
01:06:58,464 --> 01:07:01,967
and one day he stood up
and went out the back door

845
01:07:02,968 --> 01:07:04,970
while I went out the front.

846
01:07:06,972 --> 01:07:08,474
Are you kidding me?

847
01:07:08,509 --> 01:07:09,475
No.

848
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:15,981
Listen, you be nice to Jack.

849
01:07:16,482 --> 01:07:18,984
Sometimes I think
he's what I like
about you best.

850
01:07:19,985 --> 01:07:22,488
I'll see you
at the reading in New York.

851
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:26,957
16th.

852
01:07:26,992 --> 01:07:28,459
16th.

853
01:07:28,494 --> 01:07:30,496
Adios.

854
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,531
What was he in jail for?

855
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:54,570
Well, they said it was
for not paying his taxes,

856
01:07:54,605 --> 01:07:57,073
but really,
for being an outsider.

857
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,042
Refusing to go along.

858
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,578
Lowell, you're being moved.

859
01:08:02,613 --> 01:08:03,579
Why?

860
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,082
You're going to
final holding.
No.

861
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,085
Come on, Lowell.
Open the door.

862
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,058
Stand up.

863
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,594
Put your arms
behind your back.

864
01:08:18,629 --> 01:08:20,096
Ok, last chance.

865
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:21,597
Well, get up.
Ah!

866
01:08:21,632 --> 01:08:22,563
Turn around.

867
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,600
Put your arms
behind your back.

868
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,121
Now Dick and me,
we're next in line.

869
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,628
I'm so sorry I致e been away.

870
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,633
It was a long time.

871
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,137
I know.

872
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,143
How's the book coming along?

873
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,646
Oh, very slowly.

874
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,116
Will you show it to me?

875
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,653
I've hardly written anything.

876
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,682
Good evening, New Yorkers,

877
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:50,769
and thank you for coming
to the first public reading,

878
01:09:50,804 --> 01:09:53,272
the first offering
of any kind,

879
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:56,775
of Truman Capote's new work,
in cold blood.

880
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:13,292
Hello.
My name is Truman Capote.

881
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,546
For this...
for this evening's program,

882
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:20,191
I知 going to read, uh,
some passages

883
01:10:20,226 --> 01:10:22,801
from the first 3 parts
of my new book.

884
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,309
"The village of Holcomb

885
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:34,312
"stands on
the high wheat plains
of western Kansas,

886
01:10:34,347 --> 01:10:37,816
"a lonesome area
that other Kansans
call 'out there.'

887
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:42,786
"Until one morning
in mid-November, 1959,

888
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:47,826
"few Americans,
in fact, few Kansans,
had ever heard of Holcomb.

889
01:10:47,861 --> 01:10:50,329
"Like the waters
of the Arkansas river,

890
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,831
"like the motorists
on the highway,

891
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,834
"exceptional happenings
never stopped there.

892
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,850
"Perry Smith's voice
was both gentle and prim.

893
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,353
"A voice that, though soft,

894
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:18,322
"manufactured
each sound exactly,

895
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,861
"ejected it like a smoke ring
issuing from
a parson's mouth.

896
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,119
"The 4 coffins,
which quite filled

897
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,337
the small,
flower-crowded parlor

898
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,874
"were to be sealed
at the funeral services,

899
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,842
"very understandably,

900
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:42,381
"for the effect
was disquieting.

901
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:46,885
"Nancy wore her dress
of cherry-red velvet,

902
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,888
"her brother
a bright plaid shirt.

903
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,856
"The parents
were more sedately attired,

904
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:57,896
"Mr. Clutter
in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-blue crepe.

905
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:02,901
"And it was this especially
that lent the scene
an awful aura,

906
01:12:02,936 --> 01:12:05,904
"the head of each
was completely encased
in cotton.

907
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,372
"A swollen cocoon

908
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,410
"twice the size of
an ordinary blown-up balloon.

909
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,877
"And the cotton,

910
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,416
"because it had been sprayed
with a glossy substance,

911
01:12:17,451 --> 01:12:19,918
"twinkled like
Christmas tree snow.

912
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,425
"One Tuesday at dawn,
a carload of strangers,

913
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,892
"ignorant
of the local disaster,

914
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,930
"were startled
by what they saw
as they crossed the prairies

915
01:12:31,965 --> 01:12:33,932
"and passed through Holcomb.

916
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:36,400
"Windows ablaze.

917
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,403
"Almost every window
in almost every house,

918
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,941
"and in
the brightly-lit rooms,
fully-clothed people,

919
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:44,943
"even entire families,

920
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:50,449
"who had sat
the whole night wide awake
watchful, listening.

921
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,951
"Of what
were they frightened?

922
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,954
It might happen again."

923
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,958
Thank you.

924
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,917
And I slipped
and I ripped a hole

925
01:13:25,952 --> 01:13:28,353
from the bottom
of my scrotum...

926
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,858
All the way
up to the top
of the crack of my ass.

927
01:13:33,859 --> 01:13:35,826
And I sat there.

928
01:13:35,861 --> 01:13:38,829
And I didn't know it.
All I felt was a...

929
01:13:38,864 --> 01:13:42,367
I... I didn't know it.
All I felt was a cool breeze
you know, between my...

930
01:13:45,871 --> 01:13:47,873
Sorry. If I may, uh...

931
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:50,876
yes.

932
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:54,880
Your portrait of those men
was terrifying.

933
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:56,882
Terrifying.

934
01:13:58,884 --> 01:14:00,385
Thank you.

935
01:14:03,388 --> 01:14:06,391
Stop that man!
Come back here!

936
01:14:06,892 --> 01:14:07,858
Dad!

937
01:14:11,897 --> 01:14:13,899
Have any of you
met my father?

938
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:20,906
He hasn't spanked me
in years.

939
01:14:21,907 --> 01:14:24,910
George didn't come backstage.

940
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,877
He had... he had a...

941
01:14:26,912 --> 01:14:29,915
something that his wife
had to rush him off to.

942
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,381
But he made a point of...

943
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:33,918
yeah, well, I知 still wal...
I知 still waiting for a call.

944
01:14:33,953 --> 01:14:36,421
It was beautiful.
And everybody came.
Hmm. Tennessee...

945
01:14:36,456 --> 01:14:37,923
everybody came.
Tennessee loved it.

946
01:14:38,423 --> 01:14:39,424
Of course he loved it.

947
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:42,392
Should we do more?

948
01:14:42,427 --> 01:14:45,430
No, we... we just sit and wait
while people talk about it

949
01:14:45,931 --> 01:14:48,899
and we let them do the work.

950
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:52,938
I mean,
this... this book is going
to change everything.

951
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:56,441
It's gonna change
how people see your writing.

952
01:14:59,444 --> 01:15:02,447
I think it's going to Chan
how people write.

953
01:15:05,951 --> 01:15:08,453
Are you gonna be finished
by October?

954
01:15:08,488 --> 01:15:09,955
I think so.

955
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:15,961
You know, they're scheduled
for next month.

956
01:15:15,996 --> 01:15:16,962
To hang.

957
01:15:17,963 --> 01:15:19,930
Yeah.

958
01:15:19,965 --> 01:15:24,970
We're gonna commit
as many issues
as it takes to publish.

959
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:26,937
Whatever it takes.

960
01:15:26,972 --> 01:15:29,474
Well, I知 going to Kansas
tomorrow, and...

961
01:15:30,976 --> 01:15:32,477
and I値l get Perry to talk.

962
01:15:32,512 --> 01:15:34,479
What's he got to lose?

963
01:15:36,982 --> 01:15:38,483
Sorry, but...

964
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:45,490
hey, this may
sound strange to you,

965
01:15:46,491 --> 01:15:48,743
but I知 going to miss him.

966
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:50,996
You'll be able to finish now.

967
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,071
Need to check your
papers, sir.

968
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,577
This is what we've been
waiting for.

969
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,580
A stay of execution
to make a federal appeal.

970
01:16:24,615 --> 01:16:26,582
All thanks to you.

971
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,551
Thank you!

972
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,052
They're not gonna
corner me now.

973
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,090
Not unless the U.S.
Government says so.

974
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:38,093
Kansas has had it in
for me for 10 years.

975
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,596
They can't corner me now.
Mmm-mmm.

976
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:42,598
Hey, Perry, sit down

977
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,100
for a minute.

978
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:52,107
I... I need you to talk to me.

979
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,610
We've got all the time
in the world to talk.

980
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:56,577
I've been
thinking about Ricardo.

981
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,615
You really need
to stop sending him
those trashy books.

982
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,118
I won't even
mention the pornography.

983
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,085
Now, I realize that

984
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,123
Dick probably can't
grasp the literature
that you gave me.

985
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,376
Uh, the books you
send him only...

986
01:17:11,411 --> 01:17:14,522
they only exacerbate
the problem.

987
01:17:14,557 --> 01:17:17,598
They only heighten
or intensify it.

988
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,635
Maybe we can get him
started on a program.
Perry,

989
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:22,137
I know what
"exacerbate" means.

990
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,106
Ok, well, just thinking...

991
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:28,143
there... there's not
a word or a sentence

992
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,396
or a concept that you
can illuminate for me.

993
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:34,149
There is one singular reas
I keep coming here.

994
01:17:34,184 --> 01:17:37,653
Truman.
November 14, 1959.

995
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,156
3 years ago. 3 years.

996
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,124
Hmm?

997
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,162
And that's... that's all
I want to hear from you.

998
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,171
Now I asked you not to. Ever.

999
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,675
This is absurd.

1000
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,177
Do you know
what absurd means?

1001
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:09,184
I'm ready.
I have a plane to catch.

1002
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,152
I found your sister
in Tacoma.

1003
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:15,190
Maybe she'll talk to me
about something useful.

1004
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,696
Please don't go out there.

1005
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,701
Hey, this is my work, Perry.

1006
01:18:25,736 --> 01:18:27,668
I'm working.

1007
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,206
And when you want to tell
what I need to hear,
you let me know.

1008
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,969
June's dead.

1009
01:18:44,004 --> 01:18:45,721
Frank shot himself.

1010
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,725
Now Perry did what he did.

1011
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,230
I used to love him.
He was my little doll.

1012
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,198
He scares me now.

1013
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,235
When was the last time
you saw him?

1014
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,237
10 years ago.

1015
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:04,740
10 years.

1016
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,749
Could I borrow
one of these pictures?

1017
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,252
Take the whole thing.
I don't want them anymore.

1018
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,722
Don't be taken in
by my brother.

1019
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,759
He's got this sensitive side
he'll show.

1020
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:27,227
You believe he's gentle
and so easily hurt,

1021
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:31,266
but he'd just as soon
kill you as shake your hand.
I believe that.

1022
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,610
Hello, handsome.

1023
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,650
What's the name of your book?

1024
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:32,626
What's the name of your book?

1025
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,163
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1026
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:48,176
"Truman Capote
read last night
before a packed audience

1027
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,682
"from his nonfiction
book in cold blood.

1028
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:01,189
"The true-crime novel
tells of killers
Richard Hickock

1029
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,191
"and Perry Smith,

1030
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,196
who brutally murdered
a Kansas family 3 years ago."

1031
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,165
Wait, who sent that to you?

1032
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,167
That's not
your goddamn business.

1033
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,704
It is my business,
because it's not true.

1034
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:19,207
The organizers of
the reading needed a title.

1035
01:21:19,242 --> 01:21:21,174
They picked one,

1036
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,712
a sensational one, I admit,

1037
01:21:23,747 --> 01:21:25,213
to attract a crowd.

1038
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,721
They picked it?

1039
01:21:32,756 --> 01:21:33,722
Yes.

1040
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,690
It's not your title.

1041
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,227
Perry,
I haven't chosen one yet.

1042
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,195
How could I choose a title

1043
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,232
when we still haven't
talked about that night?

1044
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:49,070
How could I?
I couldn't possibly.

1045
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,579
You pretend to be my friend.

1046
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,081
I'm sorry.

1047
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,085
I should have told you.

1048
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,089
And I couldn't pretend
to be your friend

1049
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,510
'cause the truth is,
I can't help wanting to be.

1050
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:20,018
You don't have to
tell me anything...

1051
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,940
if you don't want to.

1052
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,954
I have something

1053
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,457
from your sister.

1054
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,469
She misses you.

1055
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,490
Look at my belly.

1056
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,796
There must be
something wrong with us,
to do what we did.

1057
01:23:49,808 --> 01:23:52,694
We heard there was
$10,000 in that house.

1058
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:57,699
Once we tied up everybody
and searched all over,

1059
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,701
I knew the guy
that told us about it was...

1060
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,204
was wrong. There was...
there was no money.

1061
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,957
Dick wouldn't believe it

1062
01:24:07,992 --> 01:24:09,994
so he went tearing
through the house,

1063
01:24:10,029 --> 01:24:11,763
banging on the walls

1064
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:13,498
looking for a safe.

1065
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:21,471
When he was done, he...

1066
01:24:21,506 --> 01:24:25,510
said he was gonna go up
to Nancy's room
and have his way with her.

1067
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:28,513
I wouldn't allow it.

1068
01:24:29,514 --> 01:24:31,516
And I told him that.

1069
01:24:33,017 --> 01:24:34,519
So I sat with her.

1070
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,487
Dick came up and got me.

1071
01:24:37,522 --> 01:24:42,026
We turned off the lights
and went down to the basement

1072
01:24:42,061 --> 01:24:44,529
where Mr. Clutter
and the boy was.

1073
01:24:48,032 --> 01:24:50,034
He kept saying,
"no witnesses," but I...

1074
01:24:51,536 --> 01:24:54,003
I figured
if I waited him out, he'd...

1075
01:24:54,038 --> 01:24:57,041
he'd give up
and we'd leave them
tied up there.

1076
01:24:57,542 --> 01:25:01,010
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.

1077
01:25:01,045 --> 01:25:06,551
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists
to a pipe over his head.

1078
01:25:06,586 --> 01:25:10,019
And he... he looked hurt,
so I cut him down.

1079
01:25:10,054 --> 01:25:14,058
I... I put a box out there
so he'd be more comfortable.

1080
01:25:17,061 --> 01:25:21,565
He asked how his wife
and daughter was
and I... I said they were fine,

1081
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,070
and they were getting ready
for sleep, and it wouldn't
be long tili...

1082
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:28,573
till morning
when they'd find him.

1083
01:25:37,081 --> 01:25:39,083
He was just looking at me.

1084
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:42,086
Looking into my eyes.

1085
01:25:43,588 --> 01:25:47,056
Like he expected me
to kill him.

1086
01:25:47,091 --> 01:25:51,095
Like he expected me to be
the kind of person
who would kill him.

1087
01:25:58,102 --> 01:26:02,607
I was thinking,
"this... this nice man
is scared of me."

1088
01:26:08,112 --> 01:26:09,614
I was so ashamed.

1089
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:19,123
I mean, I thought
he was a... a very nice...

1090
01:26:22,126 --> 01:26:23,127
gentle man.

1091
01:26:25,129 --> 01:26:28,132
And I thought so right up
till I slit his throat.

1092
01:26:34,138 --> 01:26:36,641
I didn't know what I did
till I heard the sound.

1093
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,081
Added up,

1094
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:38,586
how much money did
you get from the clutters
that night?

1095
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,093
Between $40 and $50.

1096
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:50,584
I mean, the truth is,

1097
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:52,336
I知 desperate
to be done with it.

1098
01:29:54,839 --> 01:29:57,842
I've spent 4 years of
my life on this book.

1099
01:30:03,848 --> 01:30:06,350
They got a stay of executive
yesterday.

1100
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:08,853
Another, yes.

1101
01:30:14,358 --> 01:30:15,860
Supreme court.

1102
01:30:18,362 --> 01:30:19,864
It's harrowing.

1103
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:27,371
Me, all I want to do is
to write the ending
and there's no end in sight.

1104
01:30:42,887 --> 01:30:44,388
No, thank you.

1105
01:30:57,401 --> 01:30:58,868
"Dear friend Truman,

1106
01:30:58,903 --> 01:31:01,906
"haven't heard from you
in such a long while.

1107
01:31:01,941 --> 01:31:04,408
"Please help find new lawyer.

1108
01:31:05,409 --> 01:31:07,411
"If not,
Dick will have to write

1109
01:31:07,446 --> 01:31:09,413
"the supreme court brief
himself.

1110
01:31:11,415 --> 01:31:13,382
"Our last appeal.

1111
01:31:13,417 --> 01:31:15,419
"What a pair of
wretched creatures.

1112
01:31:15,454 --> 01:31:17,386
"Please help.

1113
01:31:17,421 --> 01:31:20,925
Your amigo? Perry."

1114
01:31:23,427 --> 01:31:25,429
Just put it with the others.

1115
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,378
You know, at least for Nelle
you should...

1116
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:00,882
you should try and pretend
you're having
a good time tonight.

1117
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:46,427
I thought
I壇 find you here.

1118
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:49,430
Oh, Nelle.

1119
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:51,898
Nelle.

1120
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,434
Thank you.

1121
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:55,937
I'll have another,
please.

1122
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,191
How are you?

1123
01:33:00,226 --> 01:33:01,442
Terrible.

1124
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:04,911
I'm sorry to hear that.

1125
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:08,449
I mean,
it's torture the way...

1126
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:11,452
what they're doing to me.

1127
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:18,960
And now
it's the supreme court.

1128
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:21,963
And can you believe it?

1129
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:26,467
If they win this appeal,

1130
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:28,970
I wili...

1131
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,473
have a complete
nervous breakdown.

1132
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:37,443
I may never recover,

1133
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:41,482
and I値l just pray
that it turns my way.

1134
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,237
It must be difficult.

1135
01:33:46,272 --> 01:33:47,989
Oh, it's torture.

1136
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,492
They're torturing me.

1137
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:53,995
I see.

1138
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:01,002
And how'd you like the movie,
Truman?

1139
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:19,020
Yeah...

1140
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:28,029
I frankly don't see
what all the fuss is about.

1141
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:15,257
Hello.

1142
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:16,794
Mr. Truman Capote?

1143
01:35:16,829 --> 01:35:17,760
Yeah.

1144
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:20,047
I have a call
from Mr. Perry Smith

1145
01:35:20,082 --> 01:35:22,299
in the Kansas
correctional system.

1146
01:35:22,334 --> 01:35:24,301
Will you accept charges?

1147
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:26,268
Yes.

1148
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:28,305
Mr. Smith,
you're on the line.

1149
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:29,807
Hello.

1150
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:32,775
Hello?

1151
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,777
Hello, Perry.

1152
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:38,315
They let me make
a couple of phone calls
before I go down to holding.

1153
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:41,819
Y-y-you heard
the supreme court
rejected the appeal?

1154
01:35:45,322 --> 01:35:47,825
No, I... I didn't.
I hadn't heard that.

1155
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:52,830
Yeah.

1156
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,334
I'm sorry.

1157
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:03,340
Yeah. They let me make
2 phone calls.

1158
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:09,847
We got a date set
for the warehouse,
Dick and me.

1159
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:14,351
2 weeks and finito.

1160
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:16,353
April 14.

1161
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:21,859
Will you visit me?

1162
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,361
Truman?

1163
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,891
It's... it's him again.

1164
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:03,901
It is utterly inappropriate
for me to talk to him.

1165
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:14,411
Yes?

1166
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:21,919
I'm sorry,
he won't be able to make it.

1167
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:35,731
Hello?

1168
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:37,733
Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.

1169
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:39,770
I just got this telegram.
Has he seen it?

1170
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,738
He won't read it.

1171
01:37:42,773 --> 01:37:44,275
Would you put him on,
please?

1172
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:46,242
Nelle, he won't talk.

1173
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:50,781
Mr. Shawn,
if you have to hold him down
and put the phone on his ear,

1174
01:37:50,816 --> 01:37:52,783
I need to speak to him.

1175
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,286
All right.

1176
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:13,804
Um,

1177
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:16,807
um,

1178
01:38:17,808 --> 01:38:19,310
it's Nelle.

1179
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:27,818
Truman.

1180
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,773
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee
and Truman Capote.

1181
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:38,779
"Sorry that Truman
was unable to make it
here to the prison

1182
01:38:38,814 --> 01:38:42,166
"for a brief word
prior to necktie party.

1183
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:45,634
"Whatever his reason
for not showin' up,

1184
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:49,173
"I want him to know
that I cannot
condemn him for it.

1185
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,643
"Not much time left,

1186
01:38:54,678 --> 01:38:58,182
"but want you both to know
that I致e been
sincerely grateful

1187
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:01,185
"for your friendship

1188
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:04,153
"and everything else.

1189
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:07,656
"I'm not very good
at these things.

1190
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:11,195
"I have become
extremely affectionate
toward you both.

1191
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:14,698
"But, harness time.

1192
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,703
Adios, amigos.
Your friend, Perry."

1193
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:35,135
Well, I didn't expect
to see you again.

1194
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:38,639
You can visit
for a few minutes.

1195
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,144
Yeah.
No.

1196
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,152
5 minutes.

1197
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,657
Well, well.

1198
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,160
He returns.

1199
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:04,164
I don't know
what you must think of me.

1200
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:09,670
Well,
you haven't been foremost
on my mind lately,

1201
01:40:09,705 --> 01:40:11,672
as you can probably imagine.

1202
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:17,177
You got the letter?

1203
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,681
Yes, I did.

1204
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,652
It's true.

1205
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,689
I understand why you
didn't want to come.

1206
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:33,193
I wouldn't be here either
if I didn't have to.

1207
01:40:33,228 --> 01:40:34,695
You got that right.

1208
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:43,669
You know Ricardo
donated his eyes
to science?

1209
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:48,208
Next week,
some blind man will be seeing
what Dick used to see.

1210
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:51,211
Yeah, you could be
walking in Denver
or somewhere, Truman,

1211
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:55,215
and suddenly these eyes
will be staring at you.

1212
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,718
That would be something,
wouldn't it?

1213
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,722
It would be. It would be.

1214
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,738
You'll be watching?

1215
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:20,741
I don't know, I値l be...

1216
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:24,745
do you want me to?

1217
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,752
I'd like to have
a friend there.

1218
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:35,255
Ok. Then I will.

1219
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,768
It's all right.

1220
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:08,789
I did everything I could.

1221
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,791
It's ok.

1222
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,636
I truly did.

1223
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:25,556
I know.

1224
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,566
It's time.

1225
01:42:46,076 --> 01:42:47,578
Mr. Capote.

1226
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:05,060
Goodbye.

1227
01:43:05,095 --> 01:43:08,063
You're not rid of us yet.

1228
01:43:08,098 --> 01:43:09,850
We'll see you
in a few minutes.

1229
01:43:09,885 --> 01:43:11,602
I wish I had...
Mr. Capote.

1230
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,605
Mr. Capote.
Goodbye.

1231
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:11,612
Nice to see you.

1232
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:56,622
Perry Edward Smith.

1233
01:44:56,657 --> 01:44:58,659
For the crime of murder
in the first degree,

1234
01:44:58,694 --> 01:45:00,160
by order of the cour
t of Finney county

1235
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:02,663
and the supreme court
of the sovereign state
of Kansas,

1236
01:45:02,698 --> 01:45:04,164
you are sentenced
to hang until you die.

1237
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:07,417
"I will fear no evil:
For thou art with me.

1238
01:45:07,452 --> 01:45:10,170
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

1239
01:45:10,205 --> 01:45:12,172
You can say something
if you want.

1240
01:45:17,678 --> 01:45:20,180
Is there anybody
from the family here?

1241
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:22,182
No, Perry.

1242
01:45:27,187 --> 01:45:28,689
Well, tell them...

1243
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:39,199
I can't remember
what I was gonna
say for the life of me.

1244
01:45:57,718 --> 01:46:00,721
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1245
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:02,688
Thy kingdom come.

1246
01:46:02,723 --> 01:46:05,726
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

1247
01:46:05,761 --> 01:46:08,193
Give us this day
our daily bread.

1248
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:12,197
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1249
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:15,736
And lead us not
into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1250
01:46:45,265 --> 01:46:47,768
It was a terrible experience

1251
01:46:50,771 --> 01:46:53,273
and I will never get over it.

1252
01:46:55,275 --> 01:46:58,779
They're dead, Truman.
You're alive.

1253
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:04,284
And there wasn't anything
I could have done
to save them.

1254
01:47:07,287 --> 01:47:08,789
Maybe not,

1255
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:14,795
but, the fact is,
you didn't want to.
