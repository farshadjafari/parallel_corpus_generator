1
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:26,540
Jessica McDowell.
Cognis Chemicals.

2
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:28,696
When do you leave Kuala Lumpur, Ms.
Macdowall?

3
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:32,246
I fly to Taiwan Tuesday then back
to Dusseldorf.

4
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:35,703
Mr Tabir is very busy this morning.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,211
Oh I can imagine.

6
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:43,782
Seeing’s we’re waiting..

7
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,772
..Why don’t you practice your
little pitch on me?

8
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:51,727
Actually. If it’s all the same-

9
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:56,690
I know all my uncle’s business. He
trusts me. Begin.

10
00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:03,726
Well. I’m sure you’re aware that recently,

11
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:10,550
your subsidiary, developed an organic, ester based
lubricant derived from Kernel oil, that makes...

12
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,275
You American?

13
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:16,544
Canadian. Actually.
From Toronto.

14
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:18,395
You a Maple Leafs fan?

15
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,484
Uh. No. Not really.

16
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:25,082
You must be the only person from
Toronto’s not a hockey fan.

17
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:28,684
Oh I’m a fan. Dad’s from Vancouver,
so I’m a Canuck.

18
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:31,544
Between us, the Maple Leaves suck.

19
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:35,296
They should never have signed Mark Bell. Guy’s
a liability, on an off the ice.

20
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:36,294
So
who’s your team?

21
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,672
I don’t like hockey.

22
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:43,266
Unfortunately, Mr Tabir has no
window this morning.

23
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:47,111
He extends invitation
to private reception at his residence.

24
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:50,402
Well, if that's ok?
I don’t wanna intrude.

25
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:52,829
Come...
to the party.

26
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,061
Why are we stopping?

27
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:16,199
Ms. Macdowall, my uncle believes
that trust is something you earn.

28
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:21,219
And he doesn’t trust anyone until
he knows them very, very well..

29
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:25,946
But he trusts you, Hafiz..

30
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:29,483
How do you know my name?

31
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:37,497
Your car was swept an hour ago.

32
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,905
Do not get out. If you get out of
this car I can’t protect you.

33
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,578
Who are you?

34
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:44,830
Let go of my arm Hafiz. NOW.

35
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,450
Your uncle is in business with Abu Domar Khan.

36
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:53,218
Khan has made contact with a terror organisation,
via an aid agency in Pakistan.

37
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:55,565
They are seeking materials to build a weapon.

38
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:56,635
That’s bullshit.

39
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,331
We need information about your uncle.
Contacts. Shipments.

40
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:02,583
If you help us, we help you.

41
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:08,363
If you don’t, your brother dies and
tomorrow you’re sitting with your uncle

42
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:12,034
Right now, you have no idea what we can and cannot do.

43
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:17,836
You will get a call at 8am.
You’ll be asked if you need a cleaner.

44
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:21,738
You want her to come three mornings per week.
Do you understand?

45
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,818
I said,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

46
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:41,659
- FAIR GAME -

47
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,268
I swear to god, he can’t turn, slow down,
for like four hundred yards.

48
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,165
And yet I’m incredible in bed.

49
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,754
Listen, Steve and I
are not going on the same plane together.

50
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,931
We are not even gonna take the same train together.

51
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,688
It only takes one to fly
plane into a nuclear power plant.

52
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:26,005
Disneyworld.
A sarin attack on Disneyworld.

53
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:28,971
- Yeah, but whatever they’re telling us,
we’re totally vulnerable.

54
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:30,617
I mean who’s protecting us.

55
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,567
Would you risk taking your
kids to Disneyworld right now?

56
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:34,365
Would you do that?

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,579
Absolutely not.

58
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:39,162
I'd be terrified,
exposing my children to what adds up,

59
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,353
to clearing house for crappy merchandise
and disaapointing rides.

60
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:45,566
Joe thinks Disneyland is Vegas for kids.

61
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:48,140
So... Valerie,
what do you do?

62
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:51,694
I work in Venture Capital.
Brewster Jennings, here in Georgetown.

63
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,267
Cool. So like net startups..?

64
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:57,701
Exactly. Retail and consumer.
We create pooled investment vehicles..

65
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:58,939
It's actually, pretty boring.

66
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,754
You get on a plane, two
guys with turbans,

67
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,809
seats one A and one B.

68
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:09,675
They look nervous. They’re
sweating, they are sweaty... they are saying prayers..

69
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,960
What do you do?

70
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,970
Steve, you have a kid right?

71
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,143
You’re off that plane. You’re calling the cops.
I think if we’re honest we all are.

72
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:16,143
Joe? You know you are.

73
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:20,966
I mean come on, you see these guys.
Two guys, On a plane. Turbans. Sweating. Prayers.

74
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:24,601
The whole thing. What do you say?
What’s the call?

75
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,867
Well Jeff..

76
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:28,867
He started.

77
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,407
Yeah,
Everytime.

78
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,397
Every time we go out.

79
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:36,819
He asked me a question,
and I gave a him a full and considerate response.

80
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,843
He’s drunk Joe.

81
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:40,919
Everybody’s had a hard day.
They’re just trying to let off steam-

82
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:43,102
By invoking quasi-racist connundra?

83
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:43,997
The guy’s a parent.

84
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,194
Is he telling his four year old to fear all men in turbans?

85
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:50,247
It’s Diana’s birthday.
Jeff’s her oldest friend.

86
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:51,013
So?

87
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,275
So, you can’t call him a racist pussy.

88
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:57,121
It's not funny, Joe.

89
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:59,293
Oh its not funny.
Its a very serious subject.

90
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:03,058
If my not keeping quite while someone spouts obnoxious crap
makes you an asshole.

91
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:04,081
Then I’m an asshole.

92
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:05,536
And you knew that when you married me.

93
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:12,608
How was your trip?

94
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,467
Valerie, Where's Kim?

95
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,359
Oh, she can't come here,
untile after lunch, Didn't I tell you?

96
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:07,970
O-kay, that sounded like I'll be working
at home this morning.

97
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:08,968
Is that okay?

98
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:11,870
Yeah, Me ‘n Spongebob are on it.

99
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,491
Break it up. Trevor don’t hit
your sister.

100
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:18,034
Listen, the Mitchells wanna have dinner on Tuesday.
But if you wanna skip it...

101
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,294
I promise to behave.

102
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:22,975
I promise to behave.

103
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,142
See. Everyone's on their best behavior.

104
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:27,132
I love you.

105
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,052
Bye

106
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,987
- Bye Mommy!
- Byeee.

107
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,910
- You guys wanna watch television?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:55,884
Counter Proliferation tracks and thwarts nuclear and WMD acquisition
by rogue nations and non-state actors.

109
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,561
We’re the fastest growing division
in the Agency,

110
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:01,943
which sounds cool
but you may have to share a desk.

111
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:03,716
Hafiz hired a cleaner.

112
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,714
Gotta go.
Kuala Lumpur just wentlive.

113
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:08,006
- What time did he call this in?
- 11 hundred hours Zulu time.

114
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,681
We keep the transaction live. Trace
it all the way to the end user.

115
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:15,836
The shipment arrives in Joburg on
the 21st. It’s put in an unmarked container

116
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,554
and shipped to the free
trade zone in Dubai.

117
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:25,910
Dr Forster and his team at Los Alamos have altered the impedence
timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a nanosecond.

118
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,292
Val. The chief wants to see you.

119
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:29,405
Now, shut it down.

120
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,833
Why? We have everything.
We are ready to go.

121
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:33,814
We have actual intel on the buyer.

122
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:37,419
Manucher Vaziri. Syrian National,
Based out of Karachi.

123
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,419
On a wire picked up in Cairo

124
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,220
he talks about nuclear componentry
from a known source in Pakistan

125
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,218
he’s moving to an unnamed Gulf state..

126
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:47,687
Vaziri’s devoutly Shia.

127
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,431
Iraq’s controlled by the Sunni.

128
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,493
Saddam’s Sunni.
There’s no way this is Iraq.

129
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:54,410
Seventh floor have issued a directive
for a Joint Task Force on Iraq.

130
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,743
I want you to head up operations.

131
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:58,343
Congratulations, Valerie.

132
00:09:58,344 --> 00:09:59,343
Thank you.

133
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,691
You can pick your team.
This is top priority.

134
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,120
I need 24 hours to brief managment.

135
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:06,737
From monday, I need your both eyes on Iraq.

136
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,866
Yes sir.

137
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,350
This is coming from across the river.

138
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,456
Down the line D.F.U

139
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:19,847
D.F.U?

140
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,101
Don't Fuck Up.

141
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:29,501
Congratulations.

142
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:30,732
Thanks.

143
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:36,607
You can put it there.

144
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:03,066
Hey!
Don’t you have a home to go to?

145
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:11,072
I thought this went away.

146
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:17,729
DIA released the report Tuesday. WINPAC aren’t buying and State
kicked it back, but it’s still making waves in the VP's Office.

147
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,815
You think Joe could do it?

148
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,614
Well, he's qualified.

149
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,616
He’s been there hundreds of times.
Knows the arena inside out.

150
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:34,609
Great, we could put his credentials in memo,
gonna kick it up the ladder.

151
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:37,518
You don't look over joyed.

152
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:45,630
He’s been working hard to build hisbusiness.
Then there’s the twins. Money’s kinda tight right now.

153
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,165
He's helped us before.

154
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:50,472
Couldn't you ask him to come in?

155
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:09,512
Hey Joe.

156
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:13,414
Hey. Nice place you got here. Cosy.

157
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,499
I need to get you cleared.

158
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,877
You work in the basement?

159
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:23,642
Actually. I work in Georgetown for Brewster Jennings.

160
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,928
We’re a small firm of Venture Capitalists.

161
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:27,735
That must be interesting work.

162
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:30,801
It pays the rent.

163
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,432
Joe, this is Jack, the Deputy Chief of CPD.

164
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:11,155
Mr Wilson, what can you tell us
about Yellowcake?

165
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:13,270
Yellowcake Uranium?

166
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:22,006
I believe it’s a concentrate made from uranium ore used to
create fissile material for weapons programs. But I’m not a scientist.

167
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,907
What about Niger?

168
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:35,129
The UN Human Development Index
rates the Least Liveable country in the world. I

169
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,551
I started my foreign service there.

170
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:40,867
I visited many times,
As Ambassador to Gabon,

171
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:46,481
and then again,
as director of Africa policy for President Clinton, within NSC.

172
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:52,546
I often met with Prime Minister Mayaki. I know the former
foreign minister. I know the Minister of Mines.

173
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:53,546
I know the country very well.

174
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:56,275
The Office of the Vice President has received a report,

175
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,866
concerning a memorandum of sale
between the governments of Niger and Iraq;

176
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:03,331
For the purchase of five hundred tons of
Yellowcake Uranium ore..

177
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:06,380
I don’t have to tell you how
serious this allegation is.

178
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:07,661
No Sir, you don’t.

179
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,240
This is a request from the Vice President's office.
Can you help us?

180
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:17,113
What do you have in mind?

181
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,964
So tell me. How can Niger help
its old friend, America?

182
00:15:56,244 --> 00:16:02,948
“In summer 2001
Iraq sought to purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075
- T6 aluminum tubes

183
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:04,507
Manufactured in China.

184
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:10,531
The high spec of these tubes led us to conclude
they were intended for the enrichment of uranium.

185
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:14,175
And as such, provides proof that
Suddam is buildinga nuclear bomb.

186
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,913
In August 2001 J. Turner..That’s me..

187
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:19,727
Flew to Vienna.

188
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,775
To meet with IAEA scientists.

189
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:26,521
I produced this report,
aspects of which represents the CIA’s present position.

190
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:28,276
I’m happy to take questions.

191
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:32,610
The INR concluded late last year
that these tubes were probably for artillery use,

192
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:36,413
and the DOE agreed they exactly matched
those used by Iraq for artillery rockets.

193
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:37,413
Where are the tubes?

194
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:42,949
WINPAC has them. We’ve examined them.
This is my point.

195
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,867
None of youguys has even seen the tubes.

196
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:48,518
I’ve seen them.

197
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,444
And when was that?

198
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:54,824
When I let the covert team,
that intercepted them at Jordan,

199
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:58,349
bought back samples and delivered
them to you guys at WINPAC.

200
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,486
And I take it you’re not a nuclear expert.

201
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:11,052
These tubes are an EXACT match for those developed by
German scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.

202
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,723
You’re right. I’m no nuclear expert.

203
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:18,623
But Dr. Houston Wood,
at Virginia U atomic facility is.

204
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,954
He also knows Dr Zippe.

205
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:28,762
And he told him that the wall thickness of the
Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design.

206
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:33,442
Right, He also said that the length
of the tubes is twice that of Zippe’s design.

207
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:40,520
In fact, the only thing that was similarity
between his tubes and the alumumium tubes
was that they’re made of aluminium.

208
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:44,987
And that old metal that hasn’t been used in
gas centrifuges since 1952.

209
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,907
I went to Vienna, okay?

210
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,494
Canada ..
And i've been working on this for months.

211
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,365
They’re centrifuges. Fact.

212
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,307
So basically,

213
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,769
they’re your tubes...

214
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,637
and if we don’t let you win you’re going home.

215
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:00,866
That’s pathetic.

216
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,273
Joe. No one is saying you’re wrong here.

217
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:05,199
But if you’re right, it’s huge.

218
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:11,176
So we ask the question.

219
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,176
Right?
We have to ask the question.

220
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:21,677
Niger has two Uranium mines in the
Sahara desert.

221
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:23,083
One’s flooded.

222
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:27,870
The other’s run by COGEMA, a French
subsidiary, jointly controlled by the Japanese and Germans.

223
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:32,301
500 tons of Yellowcake is not an
off the books size transaction,

224
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:37,764
represents a 40 % production increase
in the nation’s annual output of uranium.

225
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,242
A sale that size
would leave a huge paper trail.

226
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:45,253
Any documentation would by law have
to be signed by the Prime Minister,

227
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:50,663
Foreign minister, and the Minister
of the mines... But say it was an off the books deal..

228
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:54,134
How do you hide the transportationof 500 tons of anything,

229
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:56,468
let alone lightly refined uranium?

230
00:18:56,503 --> 00:19:00,182
You’re talking fifty semi tractor
trucks on one road

231
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:04,231
through villages where nothing passed for months
except maybe one bush taxi.

232
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:07,078
It will be the biggest event for months.

233
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:08,429
To say they forgot,

234
00:19:09,077 --> 00:19:09,913
it’s like kids forgetting Christmas.

235
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:15,229
The droughts of the 80s and 90s
were met by millions of dollars of U.S Aid,

236
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:21,590
which continues to this day. It just doesn’t make sense
Niger would compromise this lifeline.

237
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,829
For that reason,

238
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:25,314
and for all the
reasons that I’ve been telling you.

239
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:29,137
It’s my opinion
that the sale couldn’t happen.

240
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:35,456
So? What happens next?

241
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,516
Well, they write a report.

242
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:41,164
Give it to the analysts.
It’ll be re-written,

243
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,072
then kicked upstairs where it’ll be
thrown in with whoever else’s report they got-

244
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:46,654
What?

245
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,286
I just think, it's ludicrous.

246
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,666
They’re gonna send somebody all the way out there
to spend all that money for the same conclusion.

247
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:55,474
Well, You can’t compile Intelligence
from a single source?

248
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:58,045
That’s not Intelligence.
That’s an opinion.

249
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,211
Trust me.
Its a fact.

250
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:01,849
Says who?

251
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:02,889
Says me.

252
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,211
You're just a teeny weeney tiny
cart in a giant machine.

253
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,743
You did your job..

254
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:12,938
You should feel good.
That's why they'll pay you.

255
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:17,061
I’m not feeling very 007'ish.

256
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:21,663
Maybe, I can get the kids to make you a
medal for you.

257
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,343
Us double oh’s are more about the
gratuitous sex.

258
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:41,872
Maybe, I can ...
do something about that.

259
00:20:46,588 --> 00:20:51,728
Angola is holding them in round of bidding
on their deep water offshore blocks

260
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:56,290
End of the year
Chevron and Exxon are interested.

261
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:47,228
It’s an honor to meet you at last
Dr. Harper.

262
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:51,734
I was unable to attend your String-
Gravity seminar at MIT

263
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:55,305
but I read a transcript.
Truly groundbreaking work.

264
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,871
Did you read my latest paper on quarks?

265
00:21:57,906 --> 00:22:02,779
Dr.Harper, I cite your 1995 essay more than once.

266
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:07,566
Dr Harper is in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

267
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,746
She received a call yesterday,
requesting she stay home for 48 hours.

268
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:15,936
I don’t understand.

269
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,193
Who are you?

270
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,813
I’m sorry for misleading you.

271
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:25,913
But I’m here to ask you the same question.

272
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,924
Because you are not Professor Badawi.

273
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:33,073
Your name is Doctor Harif Al Fallari.

274
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,593
You were born in Basra.

275
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:40,151
You were lead engineer at the Osirak
nuclear facility until you fled the rock and arrived here in Cairo.

276
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:46,116
I need names of your colleagues
in the weapons programmes.

277
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:49,805
The lives of hundreds of thousands
of your people may depend upon it.

278
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:51,470
This is absurd.

279
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,386
You weren’t tortured. Broken.

280
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:57,310
You didn’t finally escape and arrive
here in Cairo with nothing.

281
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:07,162
No, my name is Bakra Badawi.
I've never been to Basra.

282
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,921
Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters.

283
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:20,650
They were taken by Uday Hussein’s private guard.

284
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:23,104
They were never seen again.

285
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:40,151
I need names of your colleagues
in the weapons programmes.

286
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,547
Why is the OVP here?

287
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,054
The Vice President’s men are here.

288
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:33,868
What?

289
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,787
My name is Scooter Libby.

290
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:41,128
I’m theChief of Staff to The Vice President.

291
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,421
You are?

292
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:48,319
Dave. I’m an analyst.

293
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,030
In non-proliferation.

294
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,991
What can you tell the Vice
President about aluminium tubes?

295
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:59,309
I didn't realise that's
what we are going to talk about here.

296
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:05,104
Relax, will you.
The Veep’s just dotting the i’s.

297
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:08,368
Oh C'mon Jim. The only time a Vice
President comes to Langley is to cut a ribbon.

298
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:11,148
Cheney doesn’t trust us.
This shit with Dick goes back thirty years.

299
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:11,735
It’ll blow over.

300
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,394
Hey Val, Where are we on Iraq?

301
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:20,825
We need to find sources we can rely on.
We need to get in close.

302
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,667
Jim. Val thinks she can get us
inside the weapons program.

303
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:27,980
How?

304
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:00,822
Dr. Hassan?
Is there somewhere we could talk?

305
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:04,319
How long is it since you saw your brother?

306
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:12,266
Before that, in ‘83, he came here for an
engineering conference.

307
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:16,286
Twice in twenty five years.
We try to stay in contact.

308
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:17,613
It’s difficult.

309
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:20,674
Would you like to go back and see him?

310
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,757
You want me to become a spy.

311
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:31,296
We need to ask Sa’ad some questions.
Do you think he would answer them?

312
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:32,943
I’m a doctor. I work hard.

313
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:37,028
I’m also a mother.
I have a small girl and I’m all she has.

314
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:39,739
We can help your brother.

315
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:42,624
Right nowhe is extremely valuable to us.

316
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,404
And to Saddam.
The Mukbarat watch him night and day.

317
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:53,780
He could come here. He’s an expert physicist.
He’d have a job,

318
00:26:53,815 --> 00:26:56,897
his children, his family would be safe.

319
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:59,830
You, your daughter could see
him whever you want.

320
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:02,521
Can you help us?

321
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:05,000
I won’t do anything to help you.

322
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:05,966
I don’t know you.

323
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,860
Don't you care about Iraq?
About your country?

324
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:09,363
My country is America now.

325
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,726
Trust me, if there's another way to do this.
- I don't trust you.

326
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,436
I don't trust you, at all.

327
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:22,996
We are going to war. And your brother
is going to be right in the middle of it.

328
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,701
<i>"If the Iraqi regime wishes peace.</i>

329
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,129
<i>It will immediately and unconditionally,</i>

330
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:43,292
<i>forswear, disclose, remove or destroy...
Weapons of Mass Destructions."</i>

331
00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:50,765
<i>"If Iraq's regime, defy this again.
The world must move deliberately,</i>

332
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:54,001
<i>decisively, to hold Iraq to account".</i>

333
00:27:58,488 --> 00:27:59,927
Don’t make jokes.

334
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:17,639
He thinks I don’t know how serious it is..

335
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:24,111
Weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days,
we’ve been back over this and over this!

336
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:28,092
Alright, that's it.
I'm gonna handle this.

337
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,111
We’ve been over this
data with you now five, six times..now.

338
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:36,857
And... we don’t really know how you
want us to play this..

339
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,097
Let me level with you here Paul.

340
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:44,073
I don’t know what these tubes are for.

341
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:49,155
There could be something to this,
from everything you’re saying, but very likely not, right?

342
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,625
- Exactly!

343
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:51,625
- May I ask a question?

344
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:56,367
When you say we don’t really know how to play this,
what do you mean?

345
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:00,498
I’m just saying I don’t know how to
say it any other way than that-

346
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:07,365
So you and the others have discussed how to “play” these
briefings. Why does the CIA feel the need to play these briefings?

347
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:10,289
No. I mean that.. Ok. I didn’t mean
what I just said.

348
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:12,470
Which part. The last part.
Or other things too.

349
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:14,085
I’m a getting a little confused-

350
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,108
You want me to come back?

351
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:16,427
No. GOD no.

352
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:18,489
You don’t know why I’m here do you?

353
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:22,776
In 1991 the United States invaded Iraq,

354
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:27,404
and afterwards weapons inspectors discovered
Saddam was six months off

355
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:32,919
enriching uranium to sufficiently
high specification to make a nuclear bomb.

356
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:35,339
He had fissile material.

357
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:39,116
And not a single person at the CIA,

358
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:43,408
had the slightest clue that such a program even existed.

359
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:46,885
So... now!

360
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:56,101
One decade on, are you telling me that you’re 100 % sure
these tubes are not intended to create nuclear weapons?

361
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:58,703
1. With intelligence,
nothing’s 100 percent.

362
00:29:58,704 --> 00:30:01,801
So. What? Are you.. Ninety nine
percent sure? Ninety eight?

363
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:07,059
You can’t put an exact figure.
You can’t be that precise.

364
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:10,524
But if you had to say, could you
say you’re ninety seven percent sure?

365
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,874
Is there a three percent
chance you’ve got this wrong?

366
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:13,875
Or four? Or five?

367
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,974
Still pretty good odds.
You like those odds Paul?

368
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:22,033
You willing to put your name to that.
Are you ready to make that call?

369
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:25,397
- Actually, I don’t make the call, Sir-.
- Yes you do Paul.

370
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:29,002
Each time you interpret a piece of data.

371
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:34,827
Each time you choose a “maybe”
over a “perhaps” you make a call.

372
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:40,534
A decision. And right now you’re
making lots of little decisions adding up to a big decision

373
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:44,409
But what if there’s a one
percent chance you’re wrong.

374
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:48,642
Can you say for sure you’ll take that
chance and state, as a fact,

375
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:53,150
that this equipment is not intended for
a nuclear weapons programme?

376
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:58,392
Do you know...
what one percent of the population of this country is?

377
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,189
It’s three million, two hundred
and forty thousand souls.

378
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:06,851
Sir. We’re not machines.

379
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:12,387
We look at the evidence, we game it
out. And believe it or not, Not everyone agrees all the time.

380
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:13,678
It’s a process.

381
00:31:13,713 --> 00:31:15,118
- It’s a process.
- Yes.

382
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,555
And not everyone agrees.

383
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:17,556
Exactly.

384
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,442
Who doesn't agree?

385
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,049
What the hell is Joe Turner doing next to the DCI?

386
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:33,188
Didn’t you hear?
Friday the DCI took him to the White House.

387
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:35,457
He briefed the President on Aluminium tubes.

388
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:37,360
You’re gotta kidding me.

389
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,695
That guy's a tool.

390
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:44,262
Its a dead end.

391
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:47,325
So we’ve got a list of Iraqi Scientists.
How do you suggest we get to them?

392
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,866
Mukhbarat watch the scientists night and day there.

393
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:52,408
Their houses are bugged.
Their friends are followed.

394
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,349
Say we sent in a light weight tac
team from the north.

395
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,137
You get through the checkpoints and roadblocks.

396
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:59,062
You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night
asking me to help out Uncle Sam?

397
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:00,797
I’m going to react unpredictably.

398
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,897
Even if we get to them,
they won't come out alone

399
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:06,967
They wanna bring their family,
their children, kids..

400
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,477
Once we are outside Basra,
We'll ask for Jordan's help.

401
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,163
Give me two months,
I'll give you two or three.

402
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:14,561
No. I have 29 names. I want to
get to them all.

403
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,031
The wall’s too high Val.

404
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:17,031
What are you going to do.
Train a mouse?

405
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:18,911
- Maybe.

406
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:27,224
Hey, did I wake you up?

407
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,455
It’s three forty five.. In the morning.

408
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:38,956
I gotta be at the airport in forty five minutes.

409
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:43,885
How long this time?
Do we need childcare for tomorrow-

410
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,922
I left it all in the post-it.

411
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:46,922
Of course, it's on the post-it.

412
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:51,783
I didn’t want to wake you.

413
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:56,528
All we’ve been leaving post-its for
each other for months now..

414
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:59,293
That fridge is like a dead letter drop.

415
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,533
I sound like
an old... Some old..

416
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:26,482
I don’t know where you go.
I don’t know who you meet.

417
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:30,368
If you’re in some jail,
or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut.

418
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:38,932
And if you go missing,
I can’t tell anyone because you were never there.

419
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:47,299
I don’t know where you go.

420
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,307
I’m going to Cleveland.

421
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:56,467
It’s on the Post-It.

422
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:11,644
Have a good day.

423
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:55,678
The ink in this pen is visible for 10 seconds.

424
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:58,561
Only when given the the
correct chemical fixative can it be read.

425
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,862
If the Mukhbarat find any of this they
will do things to me you cannot imagine.

426
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:05,482
Tell me what you need to know.
I will memorise it

427
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:08,568
Ma’am, we have 50 very specific
questions, some extremely technical.

428
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:11,364
You have 206 different bones in your body.

429
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:15,353
Do you want their names
in english, latin or arabic?

430
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:22,458
How do you feel?

431
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:34,701
If anyone stops you
If anyone asks you anything,

432
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:40,988
stay calm.. You’re just visiting your brother.
Keep it simple.

433
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:42,323
How do you do it?

434
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:45,352
Lie to someone to their face?

435
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:47,358
Huh?

436
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,410
You have to know,
know why you're lying

437
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,800
And never forget the truth.

438
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:08,843
It’s time.

439
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:13,777
You're ready?

440
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:27,541
<i>Based on the New York Times today, How close is Saddam
Hussein's govt. To developing a nuclear capabilities?</i>

441
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:33,192
<i>We do get different estimates about,
precisely how close he is.</i>

442
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:36,394
<i>We do know that That
there have been shipments into Iraq</i>

443
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:44,365
<i>for instance aluminum tubes that are only really suited for
nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs..</i>

444
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,879
<i>There will always be some uncertainty,</i>

445
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:54,183
<i>But we don't want the smoking gun
to be a mushroom cloud.</i>

446
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:57,599
<i>:..Equipments, needed would give
an enrichment capability.</i>

447
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:01,599
<i>Specifically aluminum tubes.
There’s a story in The New York Times this morning.</i>

448
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:06,060
<i>I want to attribute The Times.
I don’t want to talk about specific intelligenc...</i>

449
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,007
- It’s a coordinated leak..
- I'm coming home.

450
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:18,914
I always close the doors.
I always roll up the window.

451
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:20,409
Yeah but you can still smell it.

452
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:25,675
What would you have me do? You want me to roll up a wet towel?
Like a teenager smoking, Maybe sandbag my study?

453
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:27,124
Just go out on the deck?

454
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,994
It’s minus ten degrees, out there.

455
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:30,289
Steve, Help me.

456
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,184
You are missing the whole point of a cigar
to get a little Winston Churchill vibe goin’.

457
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:37,112
Slippers.
A crackling fire.

458
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:39,712
Musty books, like a faithful dog.

459
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:43,203
You don't wanna be outside, GOOSEDOWN
freezing your balls off, alone in the dark.

460
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,280
Don’t think Churchill.
Think Scott of the Antarctic.

461
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:52,632
Can I ask a dumb question.
What is an aluminum tube?

462
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:56,581
They’re for centifuges.
For enriching uranium.

463
00:38:56,873 --> 00:38:58,476
Oh, that really clears it up.

464
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:03,978
Have you read about this Valerie?

465
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:07,184
I was away last week on business.
I missed it.

466
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:09,595
Basically Saddam bought all these tubes.
And we’ve nailed him.

467
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,529
We have them.
They’re packed with uranium.

468
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:13,701
They’re not packed with uranium.

469
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:22,053
So, they’re for purifying. The bomb comes later.
It’s how you boil it up it to make the big one. Right?

470
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,995
Says who?
It’s a bunch of tubes.

471
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:28,972
Joe you know about this stuff,

472
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,059
These tubes. What’s your hunch on this?

473
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:31,818
I don’t know anything
about these tubes. I’m not qualified.

474
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:34,062
It’s a pretext!

475
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:37,113
50 % of Americans
think Saddam blew up the Towers-

476
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,763
You can’t tell me
he’s not a threat.

477
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:44,675
He’s mad. Like Hitler. If we’d
stopped Hitler in the thirties-

478
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,258
He’s not Hitler.
He’s Saddam.

479
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:54,328
Have you met him? Fred.

480
00:39:54,363 --> 00:39:57,100
Have you met Saddam?
Has Saddam looked you in the eye?

481
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:01,688
Has he threaten to kill you?

482
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:05,195
You don’t know what you’re talking about.

483
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,247
We have a rule in our house.
No politicsat the table.

484
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:29,261
It always ends in a squabble.

485
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:34,720
I mean, nobody knows what’s going on over there.
At the end of the day, who really knows?

486
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:39,076
That's right Sue.
Nobody knows?

487
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,222
They’ve given me questions for you.

488
00:43:28,524 --> 00:43:29,523
What questions?

489
00:43:29,558 --> 00:43:32,386
How close is your program to a warhead?

490
00:43:32,387 --> 00:43:34,619
When and where is the first test scheduled?

491
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,315
How much 235-
grade uranium do you have?

492
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,618
Identify other scientists in the program.

493
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:43,262
Who in the military controls the
program? Which of the-

494
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:47,385
What is it?

495
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,608
They do not know?

496
00:43:48,643 --> 00:43:49,943
What Ahmad?

497
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:52,952
The program was destroyed in 90's.

498
00:43:52,987 --> 00:43:55,469
The Americans destroyed it, they
know this.

499
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:57,968
My god..what else?

500
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:03,362
How advanced is the centrifuge facility?

501
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:06,743
Which method are you
using to separate fissile isotopes?

502
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:07,741
This is insane.

503
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:11,408
We don’t have spare
parts to keep a tank on the road.

504
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,029
I have to work at a plant which
develops fertilizer. And They know.

505
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,321
<i>The inspectors are back.</i>

506
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:22,445
They know this.
They must know.

507
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:28,557
You need to see this..

508
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:35,788
We need to get Jack to see this.
And Bill.

509
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:41,865
Ambassador Wilson is the last
American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein.

510
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,276
It was 1990, and
it was a pretty scary time.

511
00:44:46,218 --> 00:44:51,813
Saddam threatened to execute
anybody sheltering people, He called, 'foreigners'

512
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:56,778
Ambassador Wilson, called a press conference
wearing a noose around his neck,

513
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:59,656
And he said,
The press reports:

514
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:05,610
<i>“If the choice is to allow Americans
to be taken hostage or be executed,</i>

515
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:07,662
<i>I will bring my own fucking rope."</i>

516
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:10,629
Saddam backed down

517
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:14,209
and Ambassador Wilson
helped thousands get safely home.

518
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,875
When he himself came home to the united states,

519
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:19,326
he was warmly greeted by our President.

520
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:23,139
Who took him to the Oval Office,
and introduced him to the War Cabinet,

521
00:45:23,174 --> 00:45:25,145
as an American hero.

522
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,644
That’s not quite true.

523
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,577
It was the Roosevelt Room.
Not the oval office.

524
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:34,497
In the middle please...

525
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,265
Does Saddam pose
an imminent threath to National Security?

526
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,590
Zahara's brother worked with five
hundred scientists at the Safa factory.

527
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:45,599
In ‘91 it was blanket bombed by B52s.

528
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:48,341
Hussein Kamel,
kept the scientists together,

529
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:50,098
threatening to
kill them if they tried to leave.

530
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:56,459
But sanctions destroyed the economy,
and when Kamel was executed in ‘95, the team just drifted apart.

531
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,546
They’re all say the same thing Mike.
Everyone.

532
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:01,345
There's no weapons programme.

533
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:06,341
So you got thirty nuclear scientists interrogated by Iraqis,
inside Iraq, who are all saying the same thing.

534
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:09,531
Jim, these people took a great risk-

535
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:12,091
To bring us what? I could have
saved us the air-fare-

536
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:14,202
The White House is getting
STOVEPIPED.

537
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:19,219
Someone is cherry picking
raw dataand serving it up to the press as fact.

538
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:21,857
And then they look to us to confirm it.
It’s bullshit.

539
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:24,427
One of Saddam's minister asked him,

540
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:28,812
<i>"Why he had executed a certain official
who had been a loyal supporter"?</i>

541
00:46:28,847 --> 00:46:31,474
Saddam said...

542
00:46:31,475 --> 00:46:38,836
<i>"I would rather kill a friend in error
than allow an enemy to live."</i>

543
00:46:40,146 --> 00:46:42,135
For me, that is the mark of a monster.

544
00:46:44,784 --> 00:46:51,658
<i>Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress,
distinguished citizens, fellow citizens:</i>

545
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:57,293
<i>Every year, by law and by custom,
we meet here to consider the state of the union.</i>

546
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,442
- Thank you, so much.
- You're Welcome.

547
00:47:01,145 --> 00:47:05,228
Oh wait, We’d like you to have this coffee mug.
And some Pennants. For your kids.

548
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:07,689
Thank you so much for coming and speaking to us.
- Thank you, thank you.

549
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:40,581
<i>From three Iraqi defectors we know that
Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs.</i>

550
00:47:45,189 --> 00:47:49,112
<i>Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons
development program,</i>

551
00:47:51,065 --> 00:47:52,804
<i>Had a design for a nuclear weapon.</i>

552
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,659
<i>And was working on five different methods
of enriching uranium for a bomb.</i>

553
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:06,111
<i>The British government has learned that Saddam
Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.</i>

554
00:48:09,332 --> 00:48:13,330
<i>Our intelligence sources tell us
that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes</i>

555
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:15,966
<i>suitable for nuclear weapons production</i>

556
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:20,104
<i>his nation fights reluctantly,</i>

557
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:25,127
<i>because we know the cost,
and we dread the days of mourning that always come.</i>

558
00:48:26,558 --> 00:48:30,017
<i>We seek peace.
We strive for peace.</i>

559
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:34,245
<i>And sometimes peace must be defended.</i>

560
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:54,304
Bill. Wait up.

561
00:50:54,305 --> 00:50:57,597
Every Team is combing
the desert looking for WMD. I can’t-

562
00:50:57,834 --> 00:51:03,515
All I need’s a couple units to bring these men and thei
families into Camp Lima and on an air transport into Annandale.

563
00:51:04,391 --> 00:51:06,965
Say we extract these guys.
Bring ‘em home. Put ‘em on CNN.

564
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:10,328
What are they going to tell us
that the White House wants to hear?

565
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:14,063
<i>“Thank you oh and by the way there was no
nuclear programme. There’s no WMD.</i>

566
00:51:14,098 --> 00:51:15,709
<i>PS you all knew that.”</i>

567
00:51:17,525 --> 00:51:20,282
Think about it, you want me to go to the DCI,
ask him to sign off on his own funeral?

568
00:51:20,317 --> 00:51:21,778
Bill, I gave my word.

569
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:24,032
That’s not my problem.
I got biggerproblems.

570
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,659
It’s like, if there was a baby on
the ledge up on seventh,

571
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,678
no-one would get up and save it in case
the White House wanted it there.

572
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:37,717
Bill’s right.

573
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:41,706
This is just one snafu in a thousand we got right
now. The scientists are-

574
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:43,904
These scientists are the WMD.

575
00:51:43,939 --> 00:51:47,262
If we can’t protect them,
they’ll run to the first country who can.

576
00:51:47,297 --> 00:51:48,603
And they’ll put them to work.

577
00:51:57,513 --> 00:51:58,904
I never said this.

578
00:51:58,939 --> 00:52:01,244
If anyone asks,
I deny any knowledge.

579
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,647
How quietly can you do this?

580
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:26,720
Listen Pete. I have a question. And
it’s real important.

581
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:32,523
Is the President be referring to
another African country... and not Niger?

582
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:35,558
I’ve seen the INR. It’s Niger.

583
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:39,072
He’s referring specifically to
Yellowcake from Niger. Why?

584
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:43,956
I'm the 'source'

585
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:46,680
I went to Niger, It's wrong.
Its not true.

586
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:49,785
I see...

587
00:54:51,463 --> 00:54:53,238
What exactly are you proposing to do?

588
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:57,719
I don’t know what I am gonna do.

589
00:54:57,754 --> 00:54:59,479
You want my advice? Do nothing.

590
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:01,830
You already did your job. You did your best.

591
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,563
You came home. End of story.

592
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:07,924
We were talking about Niger Pete.
Yellowcake from Niger.

593
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:11,152
Look. I don’t have to go all the way to Africa
to know something’s messed up here.

594
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:14,436
Three months and
what have we found? No centrifuges.

595
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:17,521
No yellowcake. No bio. No WMDs.

596
00:55:18,244 --> 00:55:21,808
You think something’s up here. Join the line stretches
all the way from State to the Pentagon and back.

597
00:55:21,809 --> 00:55:23,301
So why has no one’s stepped forward?

598
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:26,956
Why you think Joe? We went to war.

599
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:30,745
Listen.
As your friend, now.

600
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,011
Just. Be smart.

601
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:36,950
You have a wife and a family.

602
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:40,309
We are talking about
President. Of the United States.

603
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:41,284
The WHITE HOUSE.

604
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:44,424
Now go take a long
look in the mirror and say that again.

605
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:02,184
What's wrong?

606
00:56:02,218 --> 00:56:03,735
Nothing.

607
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,631
I'm just tired.

608
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,365
Are the kids asleep.

609
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,229
Yeah. They’re asleep?

610
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:12,827
OK. Good.

611
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:16,248
I’m gonna go up.

612
00:56:23,494 --> 00:56:26,517
<i>There are some who feel like that,</i>

613
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:29,019
<i>the conditions are such that
they can attack us there.</i>

614
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:30,600
<i>My answer is bring 'em on..</i>

615
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:35,226
<i>We got the force necessary
to deal with security situation.</i>

616
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:57,418
“What I Didn’t Find in Africa”.

617
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:24,847
Look. There’s zero, nada, nothing, new here.

618
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:29,986
The President's statement
in the State of the Union was much broader
than the Niger question.

619
00:57:30,649 --> 00:57:32,745
Is the President's statement
correct?

620
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:35,972
Yes, I see nothing that goes broader

621
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:40,113
that would indicate that
there was no basis to the President's broader statement.

622
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:43,999
But specifically on the yellow cake,
the yellow cake for Niger,

623
00:57:45,231 --> 00:57:48,173
we've acknowledged that that information
did turn out to be a forgery.

624
00:57:48,224 --> 00:57:50,022
So you believe the British report
is true?

625
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:50,853
I'm sorry?

626
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:52,340
- The British report?

627
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:57,766
Mark, Clear my morning.

628
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:58,766
So, it was wrong then?

629
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:05,927
Let me do this, David.
On your specific question I'm going to come back to you.

630
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:08,362
Fleischer ploughed the briefing-

631
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:09,473
I saw.

632
00:58:09,508 --> 00:58:14,172
- CBS know Yellowcake was pulled
from Cincinnatti ten weeks ago at the CIAs request.

633
00:58:14,207 --> 00:58:16,299
They also have
that Gerson wrote both speeches.

634
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,299
Karl is looking for you.
He’s unhappy-

635
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:25,118
I want a transcript of everything across networks,
blogs and print citing Ambassador Wilson, Niger or Yellowcake.

636
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:28,157
And tell Karl I’ll be in
my office straight after I’m done.

637
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,757
This has become a trust issue for
the President.

638
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:39,101
We can’t get behind this.

639
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:42,950
We need to change the story.

640
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:46,098
Who is Joe Wilson?

641
00:58:55,568 --> 00:58:59,771
David, If someone works for the CIA,
and sends their spouse on a trip.

642
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:02,626
Would there be a paper-trail?

643
00:59:02,627 --> 00:59:03,626
No.

644
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:06,549
Any such request will require
the approval of the chain of command.

645
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,448
From the request stored
right up the director of Operation.

646
00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:14,327
Yes, a paper work would normally be generated.

647
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:22,162
Does the President
has the power to de-classify Information?

648
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:42,455
Valerie.

649
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,822
What?

650
00:59:48,177 --> 00:59:51,972
<i>The CIA's decision to send retired
diplomat Joseph C. Wilson to Africa-</i>

651
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:53,011
Further down.

652
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:03,179
<i>Wilson never worked for the CIA,
but his wife, Valerie Plame..</i>

653
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:05,606
<i>“Is an agency operative on weapons
of mass destruction.”</i>

654
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:06,885
They just went ahead and did it.

655
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:09,426
Does this run overseas?

656
01:00:09,461 --> 01:00:14,630
Novak’s column.
Is he syndicated overseas?

657
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:16,474
Its everywhere.

658
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:57,124
We need a matrix of everyone you've come into
contact with in a covert capacity.

659
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:00,121
I’ve already started a list.
- Good.

660
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,069
We need to get an idea..fast,
of how much this thing bleeds.

661
01:01:03,682 --> 01:01:05,784
Sir, I have several live ops at
crucial stages,

662
01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:08,438
people in the field
in critical windows of operation-

663
01:01:08,473 --> 01:01:10,114
One thing at time.

664
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:13,775
Make a list. Then come back here.
Don’t do anything else.

665
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:18,044
Why is Internal security here?

666
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:20,218
To help us.

667
01:01:20,253 --> 01:01:22,865
To help you, and us
conduct this damage assessment.

668
01:01:30,455 --> 01:01:31,439
Miss Plame?

669
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:34,068
We are going this way.

670
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,136
Jack, I gotta get a message to Baghdad.

671
01:02:48,137 --> 01:02:53,053
I've got fifteen scientists being taken to the border today.
I have to get word to them.

672
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:54,784
I don't know what you're talking about.

673
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:56,654
Jack, they are packed and ready to go.

674
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,468
You know what this means.

675
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:03,880
Sorry, I gotta go.

676
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:07,051
Val?

677
01:03:07,086 --> 01:03:08,354
A few minutes.

678
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,642
Take a walk.

679
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:21,117
As of this morning
all CPD operations involving you have been suspended.

680
01:03:22,484 --> 01:03:26,046
Effective immediately you are to have no further
contact with assets or agents in the field.

681
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:30,012
Any further involvement
in operations is no longer possible.

682
01:03:31,012 --> 01:03:33,242
Bill. I have eight,
nine teams in the field.

683
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:36,853
We have assets in Kuala
Lumpur.Mumbai. Dubai.

684
01:03:48,218 --> 01:03:50,567
I need to brief my replacement in
the Joint Task Force.

685
01:03:50,602 --> 01:03:54,476
The head of the JTFI’s identity is classified
for reasons of operational security.

686
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:58,912
I have a critical operation in
Baghdad in a major ongoing-

687
01:03:58,913 --> 01:04:01,172
Val!
I'm sorry.

688
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:03,922
It's over.

689
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:11,873
You're a good officer.
But, it's over.

690
01:04:34,957 --> 01:04:39,623
<i>“Two senior administration officials told me that Wilson's
wife suggested sending him to Niger,</i>

691
01:04:39,624 --> 01:04:41,861
<i>to investigate the Italian report."</i>

692
01:04:41,896 --> 01:04:46,658
This comes from a Vice President,
a chief of staff or top advisor..I gotta go.

693
01:04:55,666 --> 01:05:01,888
There’s a 1982 act states it’s a crime for a government
official to intentionally disclose a covert agent.

694
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:05,845
Comes with a fine of fifty thousand dollars fine
and or up to ten years in jail.

695
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:07,606
- Don't answer the phone, honey.
- It’s been ringing all day.

696
01:05:47,703 --> 01:05:52,123
Your mom called. And your Uncle.
And Janey called from Chicago. I wrote them down.

697
01:05:53,885 --> 01:05:55,260
And Andrea Mitchell called.

698
01:05:57,228 --> 01:05:58,857
She says White House sources say,

699
01:05:58,892 --> 01:06:04,084
“the real story here is not
the sixteen words but Joe Wilson and his wife”.

700
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:06,204
Would I care to comment?

701
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:09,089
Well, I damn well do care to comment.

702
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,847
She's asked me on the show day after tomorrow.

703
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:17,672
No. You are not going on TV, Joe.

704
01:06:28,977 --> 01:06:31,807
This is clearly designed as a shot across the bow

705
01:06:31,842 --> 01:06:34,202
to those who might step forward,

706
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:39,538
those unnamed analysts who said they were
pressured by the White House for example,

707
01:06:39,573 --> 01:06:42,968
would think twice about having their own
families names

708
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:45,755
being dragged
through this particular mud.

709
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,090
I didn't prepare for this moment.

710
01:06:57,125 --> 01:07:00,727
I had no plan for this day.

711
01:07:00,762 --> 01:07:02,205
- When did you joined?

712
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,759
- 85 straight out of college.

713
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,977
- Wow... that's?
- 18 years.

714
01:07:08,012 --> 01:07:10,220
So, did they find you? Or

715
01:07:10,255 --> 01:07:11,892
No, I approached them.

716
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,497
And, did Joe know?
- Yes.

717
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:21,503
- And your parents?
- Yeah, but that's all.

718
01:07:24,163 --> 01:07:25,938
- So.. You have like lovers all over the world?

719
01:07:29,071 --> 01:07:31,023
- Did they make you kill people?

720
01:07:32,308 --> 01:07:36,632
I can't tell you anything.

721
01:07:45,446 --> 01:07:48,515
So... do you want to go shopping?

722
01:07:50,522 --> 01:07:51,816
Some, mani..pedi?

723
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:26,723
Hello

724
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:27,930
Your husband is a communist.

725
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:32,084
<i>I hope you die you communist whore.
We know where you live.</i>

726
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,700
Ahmad has disappeared.

727
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:32,168
His wife,
his children are missing.

728
01:09:32,203 --> 01:09:34,825
My uncle in Mansour.
He said they were targeting them.

729
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,661
They were killing them..

730
01:09:36,662 --> 01:09:38,004
Who?

731
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:39,435
Ahmad’s colleagues.

732
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:41,538
Dr Habbuck was shot dead in the street.

733
01:09:41,573 --> 01:09:43,534
Dr Falli was murdered in his hallway.

734
01:09:43,535 --> 01:09:45,637
- Listen Zahara...

735
01:09:45,672 --> 01:09:48,569
I know you can’t tell me where he is.
Just tell me you have him... I beg you.

736
01:09:48,604 --> 01:09:52,149
I don’t need to know anything.
Just tell me he’s safe..

737
01:09:57,124 --> 01:09:58,227
We don’t have him.

738
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:03,685
You said he would be safe.

739
01:10:05,427 --> 01:10:08,304
You said we would help.
You promised-

740
01:10:08,339 --> 01:10:09,791
I trusted you.

741
01:10:15,347 --> 01:10:18,894
The justice department need to establish
whether those in the Highest Office

742
01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:24,381
sought to destroy the career of a public servant to
punish me for speaking the truth.

743
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:27,601
What are you doing here?

744
01:10:38,188 --> 01:10:41,224
Falli. Habbuck.
Who else?

745
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:43,038
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

746
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:44,267
Don't bullshit me.

747
01:10:44,302 --> 01:10:45,579
Who else is dead?

748
01:10:46,874 --> 01:10:48,457
You were right.
It’s all about the scientists.

749
01:10:49,973 --> 01:10:50,963
We made a call.

750
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:52,322
A call?

751
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:54,422
We passed your case files to liason.

752
01:10:54,423 --> 01:10:56,369
Mossad were already on the same page.

753
01:10:56,404 --> 01:10:58,191
They’ve been trying to hunt these
guys down since the invasion.

754
01:10:58,226 --> 01:11:01,141
You’ll drive them underground.
They’ll run straight to Iran. Pakistan.

755
01:11:01,142 --> 01:11:02,568
Valerie. It's not your problem ...

756
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:04,166
How can you sleep when you
know-

757
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:05,596
I sleep just fine.

758
01:11:06,922 --> 01:11:09,111
Now Carol’s mother is here.
I’m going to have to ask you to leave.

759
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,754
It’s called counter-proliferation, Jack.

760
01:11:13,944 --> 01:11:15,119
Counter!

761
01:11:58,136 --> 01:11:59,193
At the end of the day,

762
01:11:59,228 --> 01:12:06,008
it's of keen interest to me to see whether or not
we can get Karl Rove frog-marched out of White House in handcuffs.

763
01:12:06,043 --> 01:12:09,655
And believe me when I use
that name, I measure my words.

764
01:12:18,223 --> 01:12:19,229
Mr.Wilson?

765
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:21,564
We came all the way from Portland for this.

766
01:12:24,265 --> 01:12:26,033
My wife and I have never sought publicity.

767
01:12:27,486 --> 01:12:31,498
But I know when I tell her about how much support there
was here today, she’ll be thrilled and humbled.

768
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,843
Valerie, turn on the MSNBC

769
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:43,423
They've launched the investigation.

770
01:12:49,499 --> 01:12:52,703
<i>The FBI now is conducting a criminal investigation,</i>

771
01:12:52,704 --> 01:12:56,539
<i>into who leaked the name of the CIA...</i>

772
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:58,783
I'm gonna be back later.
I've got to go over to FOX

773
01:12:58,818 --> 01:13:00,924
They want me to comment on the investigation.

774
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,051
Joe Wilson.

775
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:17,184
Joe, it's Christ Matthews,

776
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:19,038
I just spoke to Carl Rowe,
He told me...

777
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:22,599
"Wilson's wife, Is Fair Game"

778
01:13:32,869 --> 01:13:33,931
Thank you for coming here

779
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:37,903
I wanted to convey my outrage to
you in person.

780
01:13:39,644 --> 01:13:40,996
I know it’s not easy for you,

781
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:44,312
but I want you to know how much the agency
appreciates your silence in the light of this matter.

782
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:49,065
We can’t afford for this knife fight
to go on any longer.

783
01:13:51,691 --> 01:13:53,266
I get death threats every day.

784
01:13:53,301 --> 01:13:56,064
People threatening to kill my husband.
Hurt my children.

785
01:13:56,098 --> 01:14:00,100
I went to the agency and
I requested security to protect my family.

786
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:02,370
I was declined.

787
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:05,334
Because quote
“My circumstances fall outside budgetprotocols.”

788
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:10,337
If this is a knife fight, Sir
- but right now, we’re fighting it alone.

789
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:15,274
Joe Wilson versus the White House. Huh?

790
01:14:15,309 --> 01:14:17,568
Well, all I can say is Good Luck.

791
01:14:19,085 --> 01:14:22,211
But as a friend, I feel I should
tell you that those men..

792
01:14:22,246 --> 01:14:23,900
Those few men in that building over there,

793
01:14:23,935 --> 01:14:27,607
Are the most powerful men in the history of the world.

794
01:14:28,868 --> 01:14:31,459
How much of a stretch do you think
it would be for them to take on Joe Wilson?

795
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:36,229
Joe’s out there on his own Valerie.

796
01:14:37,842 --> 01:14:39,184
But I know we can trust you.

797
01:14:40,672 --> 01:14:42,023
Speak to your husband.

798
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,996
Tucker Carlson said yesterday
that Wilson’s wife sent him on a boondoggle.

799
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,707
Said I needed the work.

800
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:55,463
Who needs to work for free?

801
01:14:56,767 --> 01:15:01,032
It's not like Niger is known for its fine dining
and celebrated Operas.

802
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:02,656
It reminds me of Paris.

803
01:15:05,737 --> 01:15:08,190
Listen,
someone from Vanity Fair called.

804
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:09,637
They want to do a piece.

805
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:12,774
They wanna do a full scale
interview, photographs...

806
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,531
tell the whole story.

807
01:15:15,626 --> 01:15:16,953
What do you think about that?

808
01:15:18,408 --> 01:15:19,407
What do I think?

809
01:15:21,829 --> 01:15:23,587
Do I want my photograph in Vanity Fair?

810
01:15:23,622 --> 01:15:24,848
Is that the question?

811
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:27,420
Valerie, this is our chance.

812
01:15:27,455 --> 01:15:28,923
To do what?

813
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,858
To tell our side of the story.

814
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,384
It'll mean..

815
01:15:32,385 --> 01:15:35,980
A dozen, maybe fifty TV appearances,
we have to do that.

816
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:37,289
They are killing us.

817
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:40,127
On Fox, in the blogs..
They are drowning us out.

818
01:15:40,128 --> 01:15:41,928
We've gotta strike back.

819
01:15:44,822 --> 01:15:46,949
What?
What did I say?

820
01:15:46,984 --> 01:15:48,281
Don't you get it Joe.

821
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:51,090
I mean where does all this stop.

822
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:54,481
Our address is on the internet.

823
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,465
A photo of our house.
I changed our phone numbers..what?

824
01:15:56,499 --> 01:15:59,094
Five times now?

825
01:15:59,129 --> 01:16:01,144
My name, my name's everywhere.

826
01:16:01,145 --> 01:16:02,144
My real name, Joe.

827
01:16:03,714 --> 01:16:09,230
Where doe this all tough talks and publicity
and noise and all the bullshit that you're doing.

828
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,230
Where is it getting us?

829
01:16:10,231 --> 01:16:17,093
Andy Karl told the Financial Times
that they’re rolling the earth movers over Joe Wilson. Quote.

830
01:16:17,128 --> 01:16:18,293
Earth Movers.

831
01:16:18,328 --> 01:16:21,609
Well I’m sorry
but they don’t get me without a fight.

832
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:23,926
Not without one hell of a fight.

833
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:24,926
It’s the White House Joe.

834
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:29,269
You seriously think you can pick a
fight with the White House and win.

835
01:16:29,304 --> 01:16:30,220
They’ll bury us.

836
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:31,595
They’ll bury us if we don’t.

837
01:16:42,843 --> 01:16:46,056
If I’m the White House, and I shout
a million times louder than you

838
01:16:46,057 --> 01:16:48,351
Does that make me right?

839
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:50,109
They lied Valerie.

840
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:52,683
They lied.
And that's the truth.

841
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:55,912
Truth..right?

842
01:16:55,913 --> 01:17:01,347
Well, By the time they’re finished here
you won’t know what that is.

843
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:27,776
Scooter home?

844
01:17:35,973 --> 01:17:36,860
What’s that?

845
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,595
The senate just finished an investigation.

846
01:17:38,596 --> 01:17:42,709
Findings of the Select Committee on Intelligence.
All five hundred pages and eleven pages of it.

847
01:17:42,744 --> 01:17:44,461
Check out page 39.

848
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:03,147
What’s that?

849
01:18:03,182 --> 01:18:06,130
That is the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence.

850
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:09,453
On page thirty nine...

851
01:18:09,454 --> 01:18:13,045
it says “the former ambassador's
wife offered up his name"

852
01:18:13,046 --> 01:18:17,374
It includes a memorandum written by
Valerie Plame which says quote

853
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:22,130
"my husband has good relations with
both the prime minister and the former Minister of Mines,

854
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,946
both of whom could possibly
shed light on this sort of activity."

855
01:18:24,947 --> 01:18:27,164
This is exactly what i've been denying..

856
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:31,848
I've been to every newspaper,
Every television, radio anybody, that'd listen to me.

857
01:18:31,849 --> 01:18:32,846
That 'My wife did not send me on a junket'.

858
01:18:34,825 --> 01:18:35,968
I didn‘t send you.

859
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:37,892
I didn’t have that power.

860
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:39,812
You sent an email.
The SSCI found the email.

861
01:18:39,847 --> 01:18:40,690
I write hundreds of emails.

862
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:43,401
Why didn’t you tell me?
It never occured to you that it's important....

863
01:18:43,703 --> 01:18:44,773
I didn’t make the decision.

864
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:47,237
I was asked to write a recommendation.
What am I supposed to do.

865
01:18:47,272 --> 01:18:48,995
Not say my husband knows about this.

866
01:18:48,996 --> 01:18:49,995
Well..They have this now.

867
01:18:51,974 --> 01:18:53,612
They will call me a liar.
It will stick.

868
01:18:55,003 --> 01:18:56,354
They have all the power here,
what do I have?

869
01:18:56,389 --> 01:18:57,150
My word.

870
01:18:58,605 --> 01:19:01,891
You've got to speak up, Valerie.
You have to go on record now.

871
01:19:01,892 --> 01:19:04,747
You have to defend us. Now.

872
01:19:06,928 --> 01:19:08,637
So what do you want me to do?

873
01:19:08,672 --> 01:19:09,876
Go to the papers like you did?

874
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,243
Write a piece in the New York
Times?

875
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,945
You know I’d have to submit it to the Agency,

876
01:19:16,914 --> 01:19:17,943
The agency?

877
01:19:17,944 --> 01:19:21,505
Valerie, Where’s your loyalty?
To your husband or the CIA?

878
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:22,583
It’s to MY FAMILY.

879
01:19:22,618 --> 01:19:24,798
I put my family first. ALWAYS.

880
01:19:24,799 --> 01:19:28,497
Were you putting them first
when you wrote that God damned article?

881
01:19:36,194 --> 01:19:38,956
I’m taking different routes to and from school.

882
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:42,769
I’m looking in empty rooms..
Under the beds every time I come home.

883
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:46,032
A home we’re going to lose
because your work has dried up

884
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:47,032
and your clients are running for cover.

885
01:19:48,805 --> 01:19:50,195
What has all this achieved? Joe?

886
01:19:56,684 --> 01:19:57,859
Maybe you’re right.

887
01:20:00,018 --> 01:20:01,544
Maybe I should
have kept my mouth shut.

888
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:05,158
Is that what your dad taught you Valerie?

889
01:20:06,853 --> 01:20:08,858
Is that what Colonel Sam Plame say..

890
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:09,858
A good American just keeps his mouth shut.

891
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:12,584
A good American looks the other way.

892
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:15,540
Did you send me to Niger?

893
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:19,599
“His business is struggling. He’s
on the slide. I'll pull a few string..

894
01:20:22,405 --> 01:20:23,548
How dare you?

895
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:27,331
You think I’m lying to you.

896
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:28,881
Could I tell if you were?

897
01:21:57,237 --> 01:21:58,805
<i>Well, I think it's really all about the money.</i>

898
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:03,753
<i>We're talking about a third-rate CIA agent
who had a government salary,</i>

899
01:22:05,563 --> 01:22:07,617
<i>She could've transferred withing the CIA,</i>

900
01:22:07,652 --> 01:22:10,446
<i>She didn't have to leave.
Probably, the CIA wanted her to leave.</i>

901
01:22:10,481 --> 01:22:14,099
<i>B'cos she'd already been in the press,
without their permission.</i>

902
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:18,752
<i>It's come out that ...
she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best</i>

903
01:22:46,773 --> 01:22:51,032
When we were at the “Farm”,
training to be field officers,

904
01:22:53,748 --> 01:22:56,539
they picked four or five of us
and told us we’d stood out.

905
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,676
We were bound, hooded and thrown in
separate cells.

906
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:09,682
They'd deprive us of slepp.
They beat us.

907
01:23:11,049 --> 01:23:13,408
All you had to do was give up
the name of one of the others.

908
01:23:13,443 --> 01:23:17,019
Just one name.

909
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:23,237
They push you until they find it.

910
01:23:25,816 --> 01:23:27,550
Til they find the point at which you break.

911
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:33,174
And one by one,
everybody broke.

912
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:36,859
Except me.

913
01:23:38,874 --> 01:23:40,782
And that made me feel special.

914
01:23:43,799 --> 01:23:44,974
You can’t break me.

915
01:23:48,245 --> 01:23:50,130
I don’t have a breaking point.

916
01:23:56,756 --> 01:23:57,827
I was wrong.

917
01:27:36,736 --> 01:27:38,583
Can I help you? Excuse me.
Can I help you?

918
01:27:38,618 --> 01:27:41,292
I’m just telling these people that
you sir are a fraud.

919
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:43,650
OK. This is a private lunch.
Pleaseleave us alone.

920
01:27:43,685 --> 01:27:51,090
This man is a liar and a traitor.He is in the pay of left wing hat
groups, he is a democrat stooge, and he is an anti-war zealot.

921
01:27:51,091 --> 01:27:52,591
He has stabbed our troops the back.

922
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:29,489
Pallisades.

923
01:28:34,413 --> 01:28:35,314
You OK?

924
01:28:35,349 --> 01:28:36,299
I’m fine.

925
01:28:39,151 --> 01:28:42,149
You’re him. I see you on the TV.
You’re Joe Wilson.

926
01:28:42,184 --> 01:28:43,077
No, I’m not.

927
01:28:44,171 --> 01:28:45,498
Yes brother. I see you on the TV.

928
01:28:45,533 --> 01:28:46,751
That’s somebody else.

929
01:28:46,786 --> 01:28:50,268
No no. I know you.
My name is Joe too.

930
01:28:50,303 --> 01:28:53,474
I am from Sierra Leone.
Freetown. You’ve been there, right.

931
01:28:53,509 --> 01:28:54,809
You like Freetown?

932
01:28:54,844 --> 01:28:57,966
Joe, we both know Freetown’s a shit hole.

933
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:00,914
That’s the truth. That’s the truth right there, brother.

934
01:29:00,949 --> 01:29:07,260
Yes indeed. Sierra Leone is dying.
There's too much injustice and corruption in Sierra Leone.

935
01:29:10,135 --> 01:29:11,399
WAY too much power.

936
01:29:12,665 --> 01:29:15,883
People can’t see that from here.
Over here it’s a different world.

937
01:29:17,903 --> 01:29:19,302
I wouldn’t be so sure of that.

938
01:29:19,337 --> 01:29:20,268
How can you say that?

939
01:29:20,303 --> 01:29:22,193
Land of theFree, brother.
Home of the Brave.

940
01:29:22,228 --> 01:29:26,126
Can we pull over.
I’m going to walk.

941
01:29:34,837 --> 01:29:35,827
Look keep the change.

942
01:30:00,415 --> 01:30:01,583
How’s is he?

943
01:30:01,618 --> 01:30:03,896
Oh you know. Getting better.

944
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,165
Shakin’ through.

945
01:30:23,852 --> 01:30:25,913
OK. See those birds. Those guys.
Those yellow fellas. See ‘em..

946
01:30:25,948 --> 01:30:26,890
Yeah I see ‘em.

947
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,723
I think my marriage is over, Dad.

948
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:09,504
Well. I know my little girl doesn’t
say anything til she absolutely has to.

949
01:31:18,577 --> 01:31:20,853
There's gonna be another
Congressional investigation,

950
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,138
He wants me to speak out.

951
01:31:24,139 --> 01:31:26,312
Go on the record.

952
01:31:30,091 --> 01:31:32,224
Like that would suddently make all this go away.

953
01:31:36,249 --> 01:31:37,656
We can't even speak to each other.

954
01:31:37,691 --> 01:31:41,285
I can remember saying exactly the same thing,

955
01:31:42,477 --> 01:31:44,698
July 1972, me and your mom

956
01:31:44,733 --> 01:31:46,807
Were'nt getting along,
were fighting all the time.

957
01:31:46,842 --> 01:31:51,195
I guess she was just plain
had enough of moving house.

958
01:31:56,799 --> 01:32:01,172
Wasn’t ‘til I retired after 25 years in the Air Force,
I realised we never had a home.

959
01:32:07,919 --> 01:32:10,166
Germany, Singapore, Australia, England.

960
01:32:14,915 --> 01:32:17,178
Twenty different chances to introduce yourself.

961
01:32:39,135 --> 01:32:45,783
I can’t see how this comes round.
Not this time.

962
01:32:47,876 --> 01:32:49,059
Not anymore.

963
01:32:50,706 --> 01:32:52,536
What they did was wrong Valerie.

964
01:32:52,571 --> 01:32:54,096
Just plain wrong.
Don't you ever forget that.

965
01:32:56,513 --> 01:33:01,304
Say through some miracle you even get through this thing,
there's no guarantee you and Joe won't fight.

966
01:33:03,366 --> 01:33:07,154
He’s a stubborn son of a
bitch too. He don't give up anymore than you are.

967
01:33:14,503 --> 01:33:17,094
I swear to God, she’s gonna keep at
that until she licks it.

968
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,897
They served up Libby.
He’s taking the fall.

969
01:35:15,996 --> 01:35:18,275
I bet they’ve already struck the deal.
He takes the fall. The deck’s stacked.

970
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:22,799
He gets pardoned.
I bet this doesn’t even get to a trial.

971
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:42,362
I don’t care what they say about us.

972
01:35:42,397 --> 01:35:50,003
I don’t care how angry you get.
If they take all this away, I don't care.

973
01:35:50,038 --> 01:35:54,598
They do not get to take my marriage.

974
01:36:00,069 --> 01:36:01,228
I’m so sorry.

975
01:36:03,401 --> 01:36:04,560
You did good.

976
01:36:06,982 --> 01:36:08,028
I did it for me.

977
01:36:08,063 --> 01:36:13,264
I know why you did it.
Thank you.

978
01:36:21,327 --> 01:36:22,829
If I could give it back to you.

979
01:36:25,468 --> 01:36:28,693
If I could give you back who you were-

980
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:38,038
This is who I am. Right here.

981
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:00,551
Are you ready to fight?

982
01:37:08,746 --> 01:37:12,254
How many of you know who put the 16
words in the State of the Union address?

983
01:37:16,161 --> 01:37:17,417
How many of you know my wife’name?

984
01:37:20,414 --> 01:37:23,780
How do you know one and not the other?

985
01:37:23,815 --> 01:37:31,492
How did the question move from
“Why are we going to war?” to “Who is that man’s wife”.

986
01:37:31,527 --> 01:37:37,502
I asked the first question.
But somebody else asked the second. It worked.

987
01:37:37,535 --> 01:37:41,073
Because we still don’t know the truth.

988
01:37:41,074 --> 01:37:47,569
The offense wasn’t committed against me.
It was not committed against my wife...

989
01:37:47,604 --> 01:37:49,941
It was committed against you.

990
01:37:50,634 --> 01:37:51,889
All of you.

991
01:37:51,924 --> 01:37:53,232
If that makes you angry.

992
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:56,996
Or feel misrepresented.

993
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:58,203
Do something about it.

994
01:37:59,655 --> 01:38:04,433
When Benjamin Franklin left the Independence Hall
just after the second drafting,

995
01:38:04,468 --> 01:38:07,375
He was approached by a women on the street.
The woman said;

996
01:38:07,376 --> 01:38:11,884
"Mr.Franklin, what manner of government
have you bequeathed us?

997
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:15,326
And Franklin said
'A Republic, madam.'

998
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:18,271
If you can keep it.'

999
01:38:19,218 --> 01:38:21,118
The responsibilty of a country

1000
01:38:21,153 --> 01:38:24,843
Is not in the hands of a privileged few.

1001
01:38:26,045 --> 01:38:29,715
We are strong and we are free
from tyranny only

1002
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:35,244
as long as each one of us remember,
his or her duty as a citizen.

1003
01:38:36,251 --> 01:38:41,149
Whether its a pothole at the end of your street
or a lie in the State of the Union Address..

1004
01:38:41,184 --> 01:38:44,171
Speak up. Ask those questions.

1005
01:38:44,205 --> 01:38:46,202
Demand that truth.

1006
01:38:46,203 --> 01:38:48,827
Democracy is not a free ride...

1007
01:38:48,862 --> 01:38:50,496
Man I’m here to tell you.

1008
01:38:50,531 --> 01:38:53,513
But this is where we live.

1009
01:38:54,617 --> 01:38:59,524
And if we do our job
this is where our children will live.

1010
01:39:01,336 --> 01:39:02,679
God bless America.

1011
01:39:09,022 --> 01:39:11,158
Mrs.Wilson,
we are pleased to have you here.

1012
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:14,298
Thank you very much
for coming to our committee today.

1013
01:39:14,333 --> 01:39:18,878
Its the practice of this committee,
that all witnesses are administered and announce.

1014
01:39:18,879 --> 01:39:21,660
And I'd like you to stand
and rise your right hand.

1015
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:25,847
'Do you promise to tell the truth,
and nothing but the truth'

1016
01:39:25,882 --> 01:39:27,166
I do.

1017
01:39:31,596 --> 01:39:33,266
Now there's a button on the base of the Mic

1018
01:39:33,911 --> 01:39:36,185
You can press it in,
and pull it closely enough..

1019
01:39:37,556 --> 01:39:38,965
So you can be heard.

1020
01:39:45,817 --> 01:39:48,781
Good morning,
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

1021
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:52,801
My name is Valerie Plame Wilson,

1022
01:39:55,654 --> 01:39:59,155
and I am honored
to have been invited to testify under oath

1023
01:39:59,156 --> 01:40:04,161
before the Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform on the critical issue...

1024
01:40:04,196 --> 01:40:06,655
...of safeguarding classified information.

1025
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,723
I'm grateful for this opportunity
to set the record straight.

1026
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:18,466
I served the United States loyally and
to the best of my ability as a covert operations

1027
01:40:18,501 --> 01:40:21,153
officer for the Central Intelligence Agency.

1028
01:40:22,687 --> 01:40:28,272
I worked on behalf of the national security of
our country, on behalf of the people of the United States

1029
01:40:28,952 --> 01:40:35,391
until my name and true affiliation were exposed
tothe national media on July 14th, 2003,

1030
01:40:36,621 --> 01:40:38,341
after a leak by administration officials.

1031
01:40:40,011 --> 01:40:42,154
Today I can tell this committee even more.

1032
01:40:43,845 --> 01:40:45,220
In the run-up to the war with Iraq

1033
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,718
I worked in the Counter Proliferation
Division of the CIA,

1034
01:40:49,965 --> 01:40:54,346
still as a covert officer
whose affiliation with the CIA was classified.

1035
01:40:56,236 --> 01:41:00,198
I raced to discover solid intelligence
for senior policy makers on Iraq's

1036
01:41:00,233 --> 01:41:02,604
presumed weapons of mass destruction program.

1037
01:41:04,741 --> 01:41:09,876
While I helped to manage and run secret
worldwide operations against this WMD target

1038
01:41:09,911 --> 01:41:12,215
from CIA headquarters in Washington,

1039
01:41:13,573 --> 01:41:19,529
I also traveled to foreign countries on
secret missions to find vital intelligence.

1040
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:23,124
I loved my career
because I love my country.

1041
01:41:24,269 --> 01:41:27,595
I was proud of the
serious responsibilitiesentrusted to me

1042
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:30,473
As a CIA Covert operations Officer...
