1
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,355
(bell rings)

2
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,096
(woman) Everyone, please take
your seats. You heard the bell.

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,934
You know what it means.
Last week,

4
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:47,276
the assignment was
to write an essay about your family.

5
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,839
- Who they...
- (class) Are!

6
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,908
And what they...

7
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,250
(all) Mean to us!

8
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,813
Excellent droning. So l want
everyone to take out their essays.

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,496
We're going to read them aloud
to the class right up here.

10
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:12,000
My mom says that me and my dad
have very healthy appetites.

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,802
My mom and dad are very religious.

12
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:19,607
When they're in their bedroom at night,
l always hear them yelling, ''Jesus!''

13
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:25,640
My mom says my dad's eyes are brown
because he is so full of sh...

14
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:26,707
(teacher) Brian!

15
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,153
My brother Jack is in eighth grade.

16
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,851
He told me to ask my dad
who he voted for...

17
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,757
for... for President.

18
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,888
l did and my Dad said
he's a total Bush-man.

19
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,127
That made my brother laugh really hard.

20
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,865
Whenever my Uncle Stu
comes over to play pool with my dad,

21
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:51,070
my mom says the basement smells
like a Cheech and Chong movie.

22
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,612
Well... it's like this.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,308
My dog ate my paper.

24
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,373
l checked, but he didn't poop it out.

25
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,385
(class laughing)

26
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,387
What a lovely sentiment,
Mr. Etheridge.

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,982
Maybe your dog can eat the zero
you'll be receiving too.

28
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,893
- Aw, man!
- (boy) Harsh.

29
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,126
Miss Trinke?
lt's your turn now.

30
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,081
My dad says life can be
split into two categories:

31
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,277
New Jersey... and New York.

32
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,655
(music playing)

33
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,963
(girl) My dad was a Jersey boy
who became the youngest

34
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,162
and most successful music publicist
in New York City.

35
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,367
By the time he was 27,
he had 100 people working for him.

36
00:02:55,441 --> 00:03:00,037
And even though they all loved him,
he loved them even more.

37
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,571
My fellow flacks and spin doctors.

38
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,741
Salud.

39
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,312
(girl) Daddy loved his job,
but not as much as he loved my mom.

40
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,382
Mommy was a book editor in
New York City when her and Daddy met.

41
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,951
Daddy said theirjobs
were kind of the same...

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,794
they made slight corrections
for their clients.

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:25,600
Because George Michael is a pimp
who is all about the ladies, my friend.

44
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,164
Come on, ''l Want Your Sex''?
That sound like he's singing to a guy?

45
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,241
Daddy worked so much that sometimes
Mommy could only see him late at night.

46
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,472
Daddy says that's why they
both loved the city so much -

47
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,542
it never went to sleep.

48
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,552
And neither did him and Mommy.

49
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,286
But after a year of romance
in New York City,

50
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,159
Daddy said it was time
to show Mommy where he came from.

51
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:56,463
So he took her home to New Jersey
and put her through what he said

52
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,199
was the biggest test
their love would ever face:

53
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,741
''Introducing her to my pop. ''

54
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,502
- Hey, how are ya?
- How're ya doin'?

55
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,946
- How're ya doin' yourself?
- This is Gertrude.

56
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,746
Hi. Merry Christmas.

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,557
- And what do you do, Mr. Trinke?
- Easy on the ''Mr. Trinke''. lt's Bart.

58
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,752
l work for the borough,
for 30 years now.

59
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:24,263
He's the only man in Highlands
licensed to operate the street sweeper.

60
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,527
Oh, man, l always wanted
to ride in one of those things.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,559
Well, you continue seeing my son,
l can probably get you a turn at the wheel.

62
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,540
l was only gonna sleep with him
a few more times and then dump him,

63
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,235
but now, after an offer like that...

64
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,870
Holy shit.
Listen to the mouth on this one!

65
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,346
Oh, yeah, they don't make 'em
like Mom anymore, do they, Dad?

66
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,748
- Now, listen, l'm goin' to the bar.
- What a shock.

67
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,254
lf you guys are gonna do anything
while l'm gone, stay the hell off of my bed.

68
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,725
- You're going to a bar?
- Didn't he tell ya? l'm an alcoholic.

69
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,627
- Well, l wanna go to the bar too.
- No, you don't wanna go to this bar.

70
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,632
lt's a bunch of old guys talkin' about
how good they had it under Kennedy.

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,930
The man was a goddamn saint.

72
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,836
l'm goin' to the bar with your dad.
You can come if you want.

73
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,874
No, that's OK.
l'll stay here and do the dishes.

74
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,841
l only cooked.
Why shouldn't l clean?

75
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,640
Suit yourself.
But don't wash that pan.

76
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:18,150
l got a layer of juice built up for the pork
roll, and l don't want you scrubbin' it off.

77
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,185
That ''juice'' is called grease, Dad.

78
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,346
lt's bad for you.
lt clogs your arteries.

79
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,880
lt's called juice.
And it greases a father's insides

80
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,587
so that he can better swallow
the shit his son feeds him twice a year

81
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,653
when he can be bothered
coming to visit him.

82
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,661
(girl) So that night,
Daddy took Mommy to Pop's bar,

83
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,162
where she got to meet
Pop's other children,

84
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,706
his best friends Greenie and Block.

85
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,204
Hey, your kid's cuttin' a rug.

86
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,477
Who are you, Connie Chung?

87
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:57,785
Daddy said, because Mommy
survived her first trip to Jersey,

88
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,018
he knew she was a keeper.

89
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:10,892
He said they celebrated their
engagement by going out for pizza.

90
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,465
And that's how I got here.

91
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,202
Do we have enough of these at home,
or should l steal some?

92
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,109
lf you're gonna steal something,
steal some rubber gloves.

93
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,942
(knocking)

94
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,985
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

95
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,764
And with that,
everyone lived happily ever after.

96
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,869
Almost.

97
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,497
Look, you've got two minutes,
and then we have to go, OK?

98
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,803
- Or l'm gonna leave.
- Would you stop rushing me?

99
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,437
l don't understand how somebody who had
all day sitting around to get ready

100
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,276
waits till 20 minutes
before we have to leave!

101
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,578
You try getting anything accomplished
with this big gut in your way!

102
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,949
This is one of the few days of the year
that l can be fired for being late!

103
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,980
Anytime that you wanna carry this baby,
Ollie, you let me know! OK?

104
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,221
l would be glad to go back to wearing
regular dresses instead of this tent!

105
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,627
The dress looks fine.
lt's gorgeous, OK? lt's beautiful.

106
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,961
Yeah, until l'm standing next to
Janet Jackson or Sheryl Crow.

107
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,830
Then you'll see how not fine it looks.

108
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,996
Gertie, l asked you, please,
to use your own brush, OK?

109
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,936
- Can you just not use my brush?
- Don't start.

110
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,770
lt's just that
every time l wanna comb my hair

111
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:27,370
l spend 1 5 minutes taking these
long, bushy hairs out of my brush.

112
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,074
And l mean, you ask me to...

113
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,843
(crying)

114
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,316
l'm sorry.

115
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,752
Baby, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry.

116
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,451
You don't understand
what it's like to be this fat!

117
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,494
l've always been thin,
and now l'm a disgusting pig!

118
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,224
And it's my first time
going to the Video Music Awards

119
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,462
and all the other girls are gonna be skinny,
and l'm gonna look like a whale!

120
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,699
Baby, baby, they're just skinny
'cause they're all coked-out whores.

121
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,241
l wanna be a coked-out whore!

122
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,300
OK, you can be a coked-out whore too.

123
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,813
You can be a coked-out, coked-out whore.

124
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,782
- l'm sorry.
- l should be more sensitive. l'm sorry.

125
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,445
l should be more sensitive, honey.
l know.

126
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,215
- Yes.
- l know.

127
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,348
- Baby, we have to go now, OK?
- OK.

128
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,791
- l love you. We have to go now.
- OK.

129
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,352
- l love you too.
- All right, let's go. OK?

130
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,297
Just give me two minutes.

131
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,691
- ( Ollie) What time is it?
- (man) 20 after.

132
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,067
- She's gonna kill me!
- l need the quote for the Madonna release.

133
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:31,770
OK. ''Madonna trusts the public
will judge for itself that...

134
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,245
this latest in a long line
of breakthrough music videos

135
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,374
is not the tasteless sexploitation
it's accused of being.''

136
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,649
- ''lt's artistic expression.''
- Of what?

137
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:48,092
Of one woman's constant need
to show the world... her labia.

138
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,457
Hey, can l use the word ''labia''
in a press release?

139
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,143
See you next week.

140
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,858
One of these days, l'll get me one of
those husbands that show up for Lamaze.

141
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,488
l'm sorry, babe. lt was Madonna.

142
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,692
So you were late
because of another woman. That's nice.

143
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,396
- Come on. l still gotta do my job.
- And l still gotta do mine too.

144
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,563
But l was at Lamaze on time.

145
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,867
Look, all l'm saying is

146
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,176
that guy who used to spend all night at
the office and barely live in his apartment?

147
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,239
That's not you anymore.

148
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,842
Now you have to be the guy
who's done by six

149
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,878
and comes home
and hangs out with his family.

150
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,289
That's the only way we're gonna work.

151
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,392
OK?

152
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,322
OK.

153
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,631
- OK.
- OK.

154
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,693
OK!

155
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,802
- OK.
- OK.

156
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,544
(panting)

157
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,544
- Can l help you?
- Yes.

158
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,448
My wife's water broke.
She's gonna have a baby.

159
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,747
- You're gonna have to check in, hon.
- Check in?!

160
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,779
Where, at the concierge desk?! Why
are you being so combative with me?!

161
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,293
First of all,
take your hands off my uniform.

162
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,819
And second,
l'm gonna need a patient here.

163
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,729
This is my wife.
This is the belligerent nurse

164
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,567
that's being so difficult with me,
giving me such a hard time.

165
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,973
- l'm sorry. He's a little panicky.
- Can l get a wheelchair?

166
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,738
- Let's get you up to delivery...
- OK.

167
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,779
- ...and let him fill out the paperwork.
- OK.

168
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,315
- lf we can trust him with a pen.
- Here, sweetie.

169
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,783
OK, just relax, breathe.
Remember, take it easy.

170
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,945
l love you.
l'll be right there, OK? l love you.

171
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,114
- l love you too.
- OK, l love you.

172
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,148
We've practiced this 1 ,000 times.
lt'll be great. How hard can it be?

173
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,558
(screaming)

174
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,860
- Push! You're doing good.
- (doctor) You're doing real good.

175
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,696
- No, l can't! l can't do it!
- (doctor) Take a breath.

176
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,567
- lt hurts!
- l know it hurts.

177
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,698
lt's OK, baby.
Push. You can do it.

178
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,938
(doctor) Take a deep breath.
ln five, four...

179
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,309
- OK? Here you go.
- ...three, two, one.

180
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,872
(doctor) Push. Push harder, Gertie.
Push harder.

181
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,578
The baby's crowning. l can see her.
l just need one more push.

182
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,121
- Can you see her?
- Holy shit! l can see the head!

183
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,716
- (doctor) One more. Breathe.
- Push! lt's almost there, baby.

184
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,818
Push! You're doing it. Push!

185
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,056
Push!

186
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,196
(doctor) Here she comes!
Here she comes!

187
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,668
Here she is.

188
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,262
- Do you wanna cut the cord, Dad?
- Yeah.

189
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,738
Scissors, please.

190
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:54,713
Yes! And she's got all ten fingers,
ten toes.

191
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,308
We'll get her all cleaned up
and then we're gonna check...

192
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,374
Gertie?

193
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,353
- ( Ollie) Baby, look.
- Gertie?

194
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,319
Gertie!

195
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,383
Gertie, can you hear me?

196
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,987
- She's OK. Sweetheart?
- Nurse, get Dr. Mortimer right away!

197
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,224
( Ollie) She's resting.
Who's Dr. Mortimer?

198
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,288
Dr. Mortimer!

199
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,300
- What's happening?
- (doctor) She's unresponsive.

200
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,063
- (nurse) Gertie!
- Gertie! Gertie!

201
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,106
Gertie, it's me!
Gertie?

202
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,403
(doctor) Healthy baby.
Unresponsive.

203
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,910
- (doctor) Respiratory arrest.
- (nurse) Turn it around!

204
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,505
- What's happening to my wife?
- Let's open that lV, please.

205
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,313
Baby, are you OK?
Sweetheart, sweetheart, wake up!

206
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,684
Please, someone take
Mr. Trinke outside. Please!

207
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,781
l'm gonna have to intubate.

208
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,122
Gertie, wake up, my love.
Wake up.

209
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,286
Gertie, please. Wake up.

210
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,990
Get off me!
Gertie!

211
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,399
l wanna stay with my wife!
Gertie! Gertie!

212
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,460
What's happening?!

213
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,559
- Ollie...
- lf l don't get to go in there right now...

214
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,095
- l swear to God!
- Ollie... Ollie, calm down.

215
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,290
Fuck you, calm down!
OK?!

216
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,333
l got dragged out of there,
l haven't got to see my baby!

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,699
Your baby is fine.
She's healthy, she's normal.

218
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,501
- What's wrong with Gertie?
- l need you to calm down before l...

219
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,236
Look, l'm calm!
OK?!

220
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,244
(exasperated sigh)

221
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,205
l'm calm.

222
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,445
We think Gertie had an aneurysm.

223
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,781
ls she OK?

224
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,118
We lost her, Ollie.

225
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:57,299
The strain of the contractions and the
pushing caused the aneurysm to rupture.

226
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,338
There are rarely symptoms
for aneurysms...

(_ ''That's How I Knew This Story
Would Break My Heart'' by Aimee Mann)

228
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,775
_ I drew a picture of you

229
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,187
_ You and your anchor tattoo

230
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,355
_ And saw the face that I knew

231
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,562
_ Covered in shame

232
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,836
_ You drew the bird that was here

233
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,144
_ The kind of sweet chanticleer

234
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,485
_ But with a terrible fear

235
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,453
_ That the cage couldn't tame

236
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:12,043
_ That's how I knew the story
would break my heart

00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:26,886
_ That's how I knew the story

239
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,967
( Ollie) You sure you're OK
with this, Dad?

240
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,037
What, OK?
She's my granddaughter.

241
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:53,380
Yeah, you can stay
with me anytime, can't you?

242
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,249
Yes, you can.

243
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,155
Until you're a teenager,
with the boys and a reefer.

244
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,125
Then l don't wanna know about you.

245
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,652
l wouldn't impose on you, you know.

246
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,963
l just got a lot of work...
piled up from before and...

247
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,837
- l'll be back late tonight, OK?
- Yeah, take your time.

248
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,681
Your daddy really misses
your mommy, kid. l miss her too.

249
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,843
Especially right now.

250
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,844
- (farting)
- Oh, Jesus!

251
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,255
(knocking)

252
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,854
Yeah.

253
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,599
- You wanted to see me, Ollie?
- Yeah, come on in.

254
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,372
l didn't think you were gonna be in
this week. How you doin'?

255
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,431
- You all right?
- l'm fine.

256
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,842
Look, this piece in the Post.
Why didn't you call me when this broke?

257
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:58,042
- l had to read about it in New Jersey.
- lt's cool. The nurse is a fan.

258
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,314
Will she still be a fan when the Enquirer
flashes a stack of 50s in her face?

259
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,948
Listen, something like this breaks,
l'm not in the city,

260
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,219
you find me or you find another job.

261
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,953
Yeah, OK.

262
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,993
OK.

263
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,693
What else do we got?

264
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,034
Um, Will Smith.

265
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,972
- Who?
- The Fresh Prince?

266
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,476
''DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince''
Fresh Prince?

267
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,136
- Yeah.
- What about him?

268
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,306
You remember the first album,
the one with ''Girls Ain't...

269
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,646
- Rock the House. Yeah?
- Rock the House, right.

270
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,655
You remember on the cover of the album
Jazzy Jeff is holding a model of a house?

271
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,849
Vaguely.

272
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,893
Will Smith is donating that house
to the Hard Rock Cafe.

273
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,588
Well, stop the presses.
You put the word out yet?

274
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,722
- Date pending, yeah.
- Anybody give a shit?

275
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,532
- Every outlet wants in.
- You're kidding me?

276
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,867
No.
Even S News and World Report.

277
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,908
Why? lt's an eight-year-old album.

278
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,876
Doesn't matter. Everyone loves
that Fresh Prince TV show.

279
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,676
He's got that movie coming out
in a couple of weeks, Independence Day.

280
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,515
- Let the film division handle it.
- No, we can't.

281
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,555
Will wants to keep his music career
separate from his movie career.

282
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,888
Like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air
is ever gonna have a movie career.

283
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,896
Get me everything you can. l'll put together
a press kit on him, and we'll just do it.

284
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:20,454
OK.

285
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,797
- Patty, get me Kirsch.
- (Patty) Sure, Ollie.

286
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,965
l can handle this Fresh Prince stuff
if you wanna take a couple of days...

287
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,306
Hey, Arthur, l can do my job.
l'm all set, OK? You do your job. Go ahead.

288
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,868
Patty, did you not hear me? l asked you
to please get Kirsch on the phone.

289
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,244
- Ollie?
- (Patty) I'm trying.

290
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,577
What, man?

291
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,141
l know l told you at the funeral,
but l'm really sorry...

292
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,085
l'm fine.
OK, Arthur? l am fine!

293
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,487
Please go do
what l asked you to do now.

294
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,821
- Kirschner on one.
- OK! Put him on the phone then!

295
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,453
- How's the baby?
- The baby is fine, Arthur!

296
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,929
Forget about the baby!
l just wanna do my job!

297
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,798
(Kirschner) Jesus Christ, Ollie!
What the hell you screamin' about?

298
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,168
- Patty, was that...
- (turns intercom off)

299
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,412
(baby crying)

300
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,451
( Ollie) I'm working on that right now.
Don't worry.

301
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,010
Just get there early
and deal with the menu. OK?

302
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,524
Hey! Are you deaf?
The kid is cryin' up there.

303
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,991
Can you deal with that? l'm doing
something important. OK? Thanks.

304
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,120
What the hell could be more
important than your kid crying?

305
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,688
l have a memorabilia donation
ceremony in the morning

306
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,200
that my company is treating
like a royal wedding

307
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,137
'cause apparently the client's the most
beloved American musician since Elvis.

308
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,367
The kid's been screaming
for the last ten minutes.

309
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,535
lf it bothers you so much,
go up there and give her a bottle. OK?

310
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,444
Sorry. lt's a nightmare
trying to work at this house.

311
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,147
Jesus! Let me call you back, OK?

312
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,417
- What, Dad?
- Listen, kid.

313
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,982
l lost a wife too, remember?
So l get how you're feelin'. But come on.

314
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,892
You were married for what, 20 years?
l got about 20 minutes.

315
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,795
So you don't ''get''
how l'm feeling at all, OK?

316
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,164
l'm sorry, Oliver, but that don't change
the fact that you're a goddamn father now

317
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,635
and you haven't acted like it
since that kid got home from the hospital!

318
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:10,038
l been calling in sick for a month to do
the things you're supposed to be doin'!

319
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,509
Jesus Christ, if Gertie could see
the shit you've been pulling...

320
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:19,043
Gertie doesn't see anything anymore,
Dad. She's dead.

321
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,979
Yeah, she's dead.

322
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,092
But you ain't.
And neither is that kid.

323
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,151
(baby continues crying)

324
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,332

- Searching for Christ. What's it look like?

337

lt would have been nice if you'd told me
you were leaving the house!

338
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,423
That way, l could've given you the baby
instead of driving all the way down here!

339

- Now l'm gonna hit traffic!
- No, you ain't giving me the baby.

340
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,935
Hey! Excuse me?

341
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,102
l got uptown and downtown
to do this morning.

342
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:57,046
- You're on your own with the kid today.
- What?! No!

343
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,016

this morning, Dad! You know that!

helping out that much with the baby...

You shouldn't have waited for me!

You're wiping back to front.

370

You do that, you're just wiping
the poop into her...

371

..crevice.

372
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,126
Get outta here! Beat it!

373
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,565

you're gonna give her the crotch-rot.

374

- Oh, not me. No.

375

Will you do this
so l can go out there and calm them down?

376
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,103
Why, because l'm a girl?
l've never even seen a naked baby. No!

377
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,804
Fine. Thank you very much.
l'm gonna remember this.

378

- Should l get that guy back?

l suggest you use a lot.

You gotta turn the top!

getting to know you,

month or so.

456
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:23,247
lt's just that Daddy...
he didn't expect Mommy...

(sighs) to leave the way she did.

458
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:35,065
lt's just really hard on Daddy, who's been
trying to fill up his days with work,

459
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:40,435
so he wouldn't have to think about
Mommy never being around again.

460

When that happens...

464
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,481
you kinda think it'll go on like that
until one of you dies. You know?

465
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,653
You just don't expect...

466

l miss her so much. So, so much.

467
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,372

in the world.

( Ollie) Gertie!

491
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,880
_ Within her eyes

492
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,651
Your chariot awaits, Princess.

493
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,523
Let's go!

494
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,231
We gotta go! Argh!

495
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,597
_ To fly in the sky

496
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,568
- How was school, good?
- Mm-hm.

497
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,229
- You have a nice time?
- Yep.

498
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,138
Remember to put your seat belt on?
Know where to find it?

499
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:04,697
Yep.

500
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:10,237
Lock and load.
Comin' around. Get ready.

501
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,023
- Ready?
- Punch it, Chewy!

502
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,690
- Can we go see Cats?
- Absolutely not.

503
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,823
Why?

504
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,334
Cats was the second-worst thing
that ever happened to New York City.

505
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,202
- Besides, Cats closed three years ago.
- We never do anything cool.

506
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,902
You're ridin' in the Batmobile,
aren't ya? How cool is that?

507
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,500
Oh, my God.

508
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,376
Look, no one's more depressed than me
that driving the street sweeper

509
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,780
is considered the height
of excitement in my life.

510
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,681
l used to live in New York City.

511
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,743
l could've gone to see Cats
three times a day.

512
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,689
- lt's not like l ever ask for anything.
- Oh-ho-ho!

513
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,022
''And the Oscar goes to Gertie Trinke,

514
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,257
for her performance in
Laying It On Thick For My Old Man.''

515
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,900
What is it with you and Cats
all of a sudden?

516
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,868
l wanna sing a Cats song
in the big show, like everybody else.

517
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,735
- What big show?
- There's gonna be this big show at school.

518
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,003
All the people have to sing a song
with people from their family.

519
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:16,069
- Are you inviting me to this big show?
- Duh! Yeah, you and Pop too.

520
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,583
Oh-ho! l'm sure that'll go over
huge with your pop.

521
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,811
Can Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block
be in it too?

522
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,287
Those men are not your uncles.
They're barely even your peers.

523
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,414
Pee-ers?

524
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,154
- When is this big show?
- Right before Thanksgiving break.

525
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,991
Does it have to be something
from the Bible?

526
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,623
l don't think so.
ls Cats in the Bible?

527
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,327
The Satanic Bible, yes.

528
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,006
- What?
- When you taking her to see the cats?

529
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,446
Jesus, you too?

530
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,279
Gertie!

531
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,012
Do you even know what Cats is, Dad?

532
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,922
- What, l don't read the papers?
- You don't read that paper.

533
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,823
What are you doing with
a New York Times?

534
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,418
They ran out of the Ledger.

535
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,986
They don't have the Jumble
in the Times, Dad.

536
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,362
Shit.

537
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,126
- Where were you?
- l was in the bathroom.

538
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,536
- Why didn't l hear the toilet flush?
- Oh. l forgot.

539
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,370
OK, march your butt back upstairs
and flush that toilet.

540
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,205
And when l say no about something,

541
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,769
like, l don't know, Cats, maybe,
l mean no.

542
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,109
OK?

543
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:28,710
- Pop, you were supposed to be subtle!
- Why do you teach her words like that?

544
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,277
You're gonna have to mow the park
for me tomorrow. l can't do it.

545
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,324
- Why the hell not?
- l have an appointment in the city at 1 1 :00.

546
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,883
Jesus, kid,
why do you keep doin' it to yourself?

547
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,020
How many of these interviews
you gotta go on

548
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,495
before you get it through
your thick head

549
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,897
they don't want you
in that business anymore?

550
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,731
For Christ's sakes, you made fun
of that Prince Charles guy.

551
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,794
- (toilet flushing)
- Thank you.

552
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,433
First of all, Dad,
l didn't ''make fun'' of anybody.

553
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,910
l made one remark about Will Smith,
the Fresh Prince.

554
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,072
Sooner or later,
everyone's gonna forget about that

555
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,173
and l'm gonna go back to doing
what l'm really good at,

556
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,845
instead of sweeping streets
and plowing snow and picking up garbage.

557
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,251
OK?

558
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:08,986
lf you're going into the city anyway,
at least take the kid to see the cats.

559
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,687
( Ollie sighs)

560
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,319
Oh, God...

561
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,263
l'll tell you what,
since there is no more Cats,

562
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:20,771
Gertie, why don't you come over here and
pick out another play that you wanna see?

563
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,501
Look through here.
Anything you want. Go nuts.

564
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,341
- Cats is a show?
- Yeah, you read the papers.

565
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,579
You think you're slick,
don't ya, young lady?

566
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,948
Next time you're lookin'
for a partner in crime,

567
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,283
you're gonna have to aim higher
than your grandfather.

568
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,847
- (whispers) He's soft in the head.
- (Bart) l heard that!

569
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,092
Here.
Can we go see this show?

570
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:49,132
Sweeney Todd? Do you know
that this has a lot of singing?

571
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,192
- lt's still a play.
- OK. l'm just checking.

572
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,603
Your dad one time lost a bet
with someone at his work,

573
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,473
and he had to go see a singing play,
done by people on roller skates.

574
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,478
- Cool!
- Your dad didn't think so.

575
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,771
( Ollie) l handled primarily
recording artists

576
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,782
but when l initially trained,
l trained in film PR, so l can do that too.

577
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:15,053
l, uh... took the last six or seven years off.
l was raising my daughter in New Jersey.

578
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,495
But l kept abreast, so...
l'm pretty comfortable jumping back in.

579
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,760
What else can l tell you guys? Uh...

580
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,495
That's it.
l can start, you know, right away.

581
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:33,068
- You guys all right?
- (clears throat)

582
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:40,577
Are you the Ollie Trinke? The one
who used to work at MandellKirschner?

583
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:42,976
Yeah.

584
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,854
- Son of a bitch!
- Yes! l told you, Reynolds! Pay up!

585
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,324
- (Reynolds) l got it.
- Am l missin' somethin'?

586
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,226
Nah, nah, he just bet me
you were the Ollie Trinke,

587
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,923
the one who pulled ''The Fresh Prince''.

588
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,262
- They named it?
- Of course!

589
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,666
Are you kidding?
You're a legend, man!

590
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,534
You did what every flack
only dreams about doing!

591
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,573
- Which was what?
- You went apeshit!

592
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,609
You trashed your client
back to the Stone Age.

593
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,974
- Yeah.
- We bow to you, man.

594
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,445
- You're like a god around here.
- Yep, exactly.

595
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,881
- God enough to get a job?
- No.

596
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,648
- What, are you insane?
- No chance, Trinke! (laughing)

597
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,253
- Pop, l'm home!
- (Bart) Yeah, like l give a shit.

598
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,123
You know, thanks a lot, Pop!

599
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,029
- That's what it looks like?
- l guess.

600
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,234
- What does yours look like?
- Not like that.

601
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,072
Yeah? Let me see.

602
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,135
All right.

603
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,647
( Ollie) Gertie!
lt's time for Bryan to go home.

604
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,625
OK...

605
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,572
- What are your intentions?
- Huh?

606
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,699
What are your intentions
with my daughter?

607
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,735
- Do you plan on marrying her?
- l don't know.

608
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:19,579
Well, only married boys and girls,
ahem...

609
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,050
show each other their, uh...

610
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,679
their, you know, uh...

611
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,121
..parts.

612
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,215
OK?

613
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:35,193
OK, Bryan, you can go now.
lf you come back, come back with a ring.

614
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,097
Yes, Mr. Trinke.

615
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,931
- Bye, Gertie.
- Bye.

616
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,130
Goodbye, Bryan.

617
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,334
OK.

618
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,837
Do you have any, uh...

619
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,642
questions about what you...

620
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,207
you know...

621
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,821
you know, whatever, saw?

622
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,590
Do you have what Bryan has?

623
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:15,104
Yes, l have one... too.

624
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,905
ls yours as big as his?

625
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,939
Sadly, yes.

626
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,178
- Can we rent a movie?
- Yes.

627
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,814
- So they wouldn't give you a job, huh?
- No. But apparently, Daddy's a legend.

628
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,918
You don't need that job anyway.
You already got a job.

629
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,260
Yes, well,
Daddy used to have a job

630
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,630
where a nightly shower was an option,
not a necessity.

631
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,896
- You know what job you should do?
- What's that?

632
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,666
You should be a dance teacher,
like Johnny in Dirty Dancing.

633
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:53,142
l should? Should l say,
''Nobody puts Baby in a corner''?

634
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,075
Oh, can we rent
Dirty Dancing again?

635
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:59,047
Ohh... Dirty Dancing ranks one notch
below Cats in my book.

636
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,641
Can you pick out something else?

637
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,782
Can we rent this?

638
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,553
Absolutely not. Go pick out something
from the children's section.

639
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,393
- All those movies suck.
- Watch your language.

640
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,826
Nah, that's...

641
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,419
No, l guess that's it.
Yep, yep, that's it.

642
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,093
l'll just take this
and whatever the kid's getting.

643
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,695
Just go ahead and put it in the bag.
l'm all set.

644
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,763
lt's good.

645
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,772
''Bi-Bi Guys, featuring Curious Jordie''?

646
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:08,379
lnteresting choice. Does the wife know
you're looking into your options?

647
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,579
lt's... l got the...

648
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,785
- l got the wrong box by accident.
- Oh, right.

649
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:17,020
Would you mind, uh...
exchanging that for me for something...

650
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,790
anything you can get your hands on
that's, you know...

651
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,560
- So, then you want something...
- ...that's non-bi.

652
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,103
Can l have your
membership card, please?

653
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,972
Yeah, sure.

654
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:36,479
Do you mind if l asked you a few questions
about your renting practices?

655
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,481
Uh... sure.

656
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,312
Really? Uh...

657
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:45,185
Do you always rent adult titles with your
daughter in tow, or is this the first time?

658
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,153
Excuse me?

659
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,556
When you rent porn, do you
usually do it with family around,

660
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,425
or is this like a, you know,
special occasion?

661
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:58,227
- Do l have to answer this?
- l'm a grad student, writing a thesis paper.

662
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:03,137
''A Bird in the Hand: The Family Man
and the Pornographic Fixation''.

663
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,107
OK. l would rather not take part.

664
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,542
Really?

665
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,809
Frank, is Bi-Bi Guys
a one or a two-night rental?

666
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:15,909
- What are you getting, Daddy?
- Yeah, Daddy. Let's just take a look...

667
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,954
Let's not, OK?

668
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:25,217
Would you mind not asking me those
questions when my daughter's with me?

669
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,820
How about when you bring these back?

670
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,832
That's... Yeah.

671
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:35,099
ln an effort to get honest feedback,
leave the kid and the wife at home.

672
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,437
My mom's dead.
She died when l was born.

673
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,340
Oh, Jesus.

674
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,343
Man, l'm sorry. l didn't...

675
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,848
No, you didn't.

676
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,314
Let's go.

677
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,551
l'm sorry.

678
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,650
Do I have to?

679
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:01,858
Major Damage didn't have to go to bed
when he fought the Tiki Terrors!

680
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,900
- (mom) Melvin!
- And do they...

681
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,798
- (knocking)
- l'll get it.

682
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,202
You will not. You're not even
supposed to be up this late.

683
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,537
Watch your video.

684
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:14,406
- (Melvin) But, Mom!
- (mom) Say, ''OK, Mom.''

685
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,140
- (Melvin) Ahh!
- (mom) Say, ''OK, Mom.''

686
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,380
Hi.

687
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,680
Hey! You're the lady
from the video store.

688
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:27,352
Let's not use that term too loosely, OK?
Go back and watch your video.

689
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,021
Yes?

690
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,086
l just wanted to come here

691
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,929
and tell you that l'm really sorry
about earlier tonight.

692
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,766
l feel like shit about what l said
and your daughter and everything.

693
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,807
Well... you should.

694
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,069
You know that kid was crying
in the car the whole way home?

695
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,873
- Oh, no...
- No, l wasn't.

696
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,076
- Get back inside and watch your video!
- Nice! Real nice.

697
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,847
See, now you have to let me
interview you for my paper.

698
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,444
ls that why you're here?

699
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,457
l just think you'd make one hell of
an interesting case study.

700
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:05,791
The sympathetic widower who doesn't
have time to date 'cause he's raising a kid,

701
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:09,196
so he rents porn instead. l mean,
l think that's very interesting stuff.

702
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,757
Jesus Christ!
You've got some nerve, lady.

703
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:15,202
And besides,
l'd really like to make it up to you.

704
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,264
For what l said,
and for embarrassing you before that.

705
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,368
You're really having a banner evening.
You're batting a thousand tonight.

706
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,881
You're Ollie, right?
l'm Maya Harding.

707
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,809
''Hi, Maya. Nice to meet you.''

708
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,876
Hi.

709
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,616
Come on, why don't you let me
take you out one day this week?

710
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,421
You do eat lunch when you're not
knee-deep in adult movies, right?

711
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,522
l appreciate it, but, uh...
no thanks.

712
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,590
Ollie, come on,
you're ruining my karma level here.

713
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,262
What, buying me one lunch
is gonna square you with Krishna?

714
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,827
Hare Hare!

715
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,140
ls Monday OK?
Sound good?

716
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:59,205
l mean, l was thinking nothing fancy.
l was thinking maybe, like, the diner.

717
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,446
- Around noon?
- No!

718
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,786
Noon it is!

719
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,585
Oh...

720
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,683
See you there. Bye!

721
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,556
An incredibly strange woman.

722
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,656
(honking horn)

723
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,137
l did not hear the toilet flush.

724
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,582
Thank you.

725
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,752
- Can we get popcorn?
- This isn't the movies, sweetheart.

726
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:46,160
They don't sell popcorn here.
This is Broadway. This is class.

727
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,664
_ And if you're beautiful

728
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:49,721
_ What then?

729
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,166
_ With yellow hair like wheat

730
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:56,570
_ l think we shall not meet again,
my little dove

731
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,700
_ My sweet Johanna

732
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,277
_ Goodbye, Johanna

733
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,312
_ You're gone and yet you're mine

734
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,085
_ l'm fine, Johanna

735
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,887
_ l'm fine

736
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:21,161
( Ollie) OK. You see that floor.
Now look three windows in from the right.

737
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,099
See that window? That's where we
used to live before we lived with Pop.

738
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,762
We'd still live there
if we lived in the city.

739
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,773
- lf Mommy was still alive?
- Yep.

740
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,199
- Dad...
- Yes?

741
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,745
Do you miss Mommy?

742
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,610
l do. Every day.

743
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,876
- What was she like?
- l've told you a million times.

744
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:46,480
- l know, but l forget.
- No, l don't think you forget.

745
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:49,354
l think you just like to hear me tell you.
Which is OK. lt's all right.

746
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,087
You can ask about your mommy
as much as you want.

747
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,685
So tell me already.

748
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,732
Well, she was pushy,
like you were right there.

749
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:59,792
She was beautiful,
like you are right now.

750
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,431
And she was... smart...

751
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,407
and strong,
like you'll grow up to be one day.

752
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,774
l'm smart now.

753
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,370
l know. l wasn't impugning
your intelligence or anything.

754
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,439
What's ''impugning'' mean?

755
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,644
Oh, not so smart now, are you?

756
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,347
- That's a big word.
- Yes, you're right, it is.

757
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,050
Let's see.
To impugn means to criticize.

758
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,458
So... Pop's always impugning you, right?

759
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,453
Well, he thinks he is.

760
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,897
But he's just talking
to make sure he's still alive.

761
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,868
Pop is a very, very old man.

762
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,762
What do you think?
You like the city?

763
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,670
lt's OK.
But l like Highlands better.

764
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,335
- You do?
- Yeah.

765
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:45,177
My school's there, and my friends...
And we can rent movies there.

766
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,843
Well, if memory serves,
you can rent movies here too.

767
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:52,013
Yeah, but not from that pretty lady
at the video store.

768
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,455
- Oh, you think she's pretty, do you?
- Don't you?

769
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,322
lsn't that why
you're taking her on a date?

770
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:01,660
lt's not a date.
The only girl l take on dates is you, OK?

771
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,199
This is a date.
We're on a date.

772
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,029
- We are?
- Mm-hm.

773
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:08,367
- lt doesn't feel like a date.
- lt doesn't?

774
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,236
Well, l can fix that.

775
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,006
Sir!

776
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:36,665
(Maya) So, uh, question one:
How often do you rent adult movies?

777
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:41,201
- Do l really have to do this?
- You have nothing to be ashamed about.

778
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,900
lnterest in adult film can be healthy,
as long as it's not habitual.

779
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:49,742
- So come on, how often?
- Three or four times a week.

780
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,982
OK, maybe l was wrong.
You should be ashamed.

781
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,416
You have a real talent
for making the subject feel open

782
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,578
and comfortable
in a safe environment.

783
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,748
So you're renting it presumably
to masturbate to, right?

784
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,315
- Good God!
- Come on, don't be such a tight-ass.

785
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,485
We're all adults here.

786
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,358
l know l'm an adult.
How old are you, exactly?

787
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,421
- l'll be 26 in March.
- 26?

788
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,592
You still haven't learned some things
aren't polite to talk about in public?

789
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:15,263
lf it makes you feel any better,
l do it, like, twice a day.

790
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:19,199
- Good God!
- What can l tell ya? l get bored easily.

791
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,744
You're gonna get
carpal tunnel syndrome.

792
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:25,339
Don't get all judgmental with me.
You're no slouch yourself.

793
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,248
- Well, no, l...
- l just have a healthy sexual appetite.

794
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,582
Why don't you go out
and get yourself a boyfriend?

795
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,884
Why don't you just go out
and get yourself a girlfriend?

796
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,049
l work all day,
l hang out with my kid all night.

797
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,389
So you'd rather hang out with your kid
than get laid?

798
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:42,455
- Yeah.
- Aw... that's kinda sweet.

799
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,228
l'm kinda crushin' on you right now, Trinke.

800
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,464
OK. Can l go home now?

801
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,405
No.
When was the last time you had sex?

802
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,710
l would rather not
disclose that information.

803
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,440
Oh, come on,
don't clam up on me now.

804
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,709
You're gonna remain anonymous
in my paper.

805
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,082
Ha! Anonymity doesn't concern me.
Embarrassment does.

806
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,554
- Why would you be embarrassed?
- Because it's been a long time.

807
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,956
- How long?
- A long time.

808
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,961
Come on, champ. Own it.
Just put it out there.

809
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,657
l swear l won't make
any editorial cracks about it.

810
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,200
Not in front of you, at least.

811
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:25,399
- Seven years.
- Seven years?

812
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,205
Since my wife died, yeah.

813
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:33,181
You know, a dumbfounded,
mouth-agape look of shock

814
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,151
might be construed by some
as an editorial crack too.

815
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,113
- l'm sorry.
- lt's OK. lt's fine.

816
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,556
No, it's not.
l mean, it's not at all.

817
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:46,790
With all due respect to your wife,
you've gotta get back on the horse, man.

818
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,798
- No, l don't, actually.
- Yes, you do.

819
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,165
- No, l don't.
- Yes, you... Get up.

820
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:56,364
- Are we done?
- With this, for now. But come with me.

821
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,373
Lord have mercy.

822
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,002
- Where are we going?
- To your place.

823
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,569
We're gonna have some sex.

824
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:11,879
- What, did you forget something?
- No. Look, l appreciate the offer.

825
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:16,384
l'm very flattered.
But l can't do this.

826
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,960
What's the matter?
Don't you think l'm cute?

827
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,497
- Of course l think you're cute.
- Well, then?

828
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,534
Look, l'm not just celibate
because of my daughter.

829
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,796
There are a lot of emotional issues in it too.

830
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:31,500
l mean, my wife may be dead.
l'm still very much in love with her.

831
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,703
Hey, l respect that. l'm not telling you
to fall in love with me here,

832
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,803
and l'm not trying to replace your wife.

833
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,442
l'm just talking about two consenting adults
having some casual sex.

834
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:46,080
Probably some really short casual sex,
with you being a little out of practice.

835
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,091
- l can't do it, l'm sorry.
- What are you, a monk?

836
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,855
God!
Let's look at this logically, OK?

837
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:55,489
- You rent porn and touch yourself, right?
- Would you lower your voice?

838
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,728
lf you're not sweating how your wife
would feel about you and porn,

839
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:03,000
then you shouldn't sweat what
l'm proposing 'cause it's the same thing.

840
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:07,066
Only somebody else is doing the touching
and you're saving a $2 rental fee.

841
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:13,005
Come on, stud.
Man cannot live on porn alone.

842
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,429
Oh, God...

843
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,734
l'm home!

844
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:36,897
Pop?!

845
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:41,273
- Oh, my God... What do l do?
- Get in the bathroom!

846
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,116
(shower running)

847
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,757
- Pop?
- Uh, no, honey, it's me.

848
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,824
Daddy? Why aren't you at work?

849
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,731
Uh, because l had to come home and do...
l had to...

850
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,071
come home and take a shower.

851
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:17,171
- Can we rent a movie?
- Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

852
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,444
As soon as l get done up here
and dry off, l'll come down.

853
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:22,314
OK.

854
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,450
Oh, my God.
That was so close.

855
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,821
What do we do now?
l'm wet.

856
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,129
Sorry, Dad, l forgot again.

857
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,759
(flushing)

858
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,032
Shh!

859
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,937
Hi, honey.

860
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,280
You remember Maya.
From the video store.

861
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:11,666
- What are your intentions?
- Excuse me?

862
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,794
What are your intentions
with my father?

863
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,861
Like, do you plan on marrying him?

864
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,069
Uh... l don't...

865
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:22,043
Because l was taught that only
married girls show their girl parts to boys.

866
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:27,175
- Right, Daddy?
- Uh... right. Yes.

867
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,313
Mm-hm.

868
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,412
Can we rent all the movies we want
for free?

869
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,045
What?

870
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,649
Can we rent all the movies we want
for free?

871
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,752
Yes! Yes, yes.
For God's sake, yes.

872
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:44,129
lf it means we're not, you know,
that we're not in trouble anymore.

873
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,599
And... Right, Maya? Yes!

874
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,863
Uh... whatever you want.
lt's on the house.

875
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,735
Even Dirty Dancing?

876
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:56,906
Yeah.

877
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,676
And we can do Sweeney Todd
for the show at school?

878
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,716
What?

879
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,877
We can do Sweeney Todd
for the show at school?

880
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:06,615
- No, honey, that's too grown-up.
- Really?

881
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:11,321
Oh man, what am l gonna tell Pop
about you guys?

882
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,394
Fine. We can do Sweeney Todd
for the show at school.

883
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,299
OK!

884
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,871
Would you shut the hell up already?
Christ, Greenie, you're always...

885
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,373
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh!

886
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:30,539
Christ Almighty.
You wearin' a... wearin' a towel?

887
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,039
Just as long as you didn't do it
on my bed.

888
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:38,553
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was one time in
high school! You wanna let it go already?

889
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,751
l banged a broad
in my parents' bed once. lt was nice.

890
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:47,657
Terrific. Just so you know,
we didn't ''bang''.

891
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,721
- What, did ya get to third base?
- No!

892
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,926
Not that it's any of your business,
but we didn't do anything.

893
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,492
We lost our heads for a second,
then cooler heads prevailed

894
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,131
and we stopped before we
did anything we'd both regret.

895
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,005
- The kid busted in on 'em.
- Oh.

896
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,510
Let's talk about something else
for a second, like this water main.

897
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,877
- How bad is it?
- Definitely needs to be replaced.

898
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,849
Jesus Christ. lf we gotta shut down
Bay Avenue for that,

899
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,908
this town is gonna throw a shit fit.

900
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,214
l'm sure.

901
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:15,223
Hey, kid, you haven't had to inconvenience
the taxpayers on the job yet.

902
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:18,192
They get like animals.
Remember back in '88?

903
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,694
South Peak Street.

904
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,163
Holy shit, l thought they were gonna
crucify us upside down.

905
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:27,636
- Like St Peter.
- Who are you, the Holy Father?

906
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,333
Everybody knows l meant St Peter.
You don't have to explain my shit.

907
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,772
l'm just saying...

908
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,969
When l was down there,
how many cars did you wave around?

909
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,033
Three or four.

910
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,707
Three or four cars
for the whole half hour l was down there?

911
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,010
Well, it was rush hour.

912
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:44,417
Yeah, l don't think the legion of commuters
in the Highlands of New Jersey

913
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:49,515
are gonna object to us closing down a
small portion of Bay Avenue for a few days.

914
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,857
- (gavel banging)
- One at a time, please! One at a time!

915
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,657
- We're doing the best we can.
- (Bart) You were saying?

916
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:02,194
Why doesn't somebody just go up there
and explain to them what's happening?

917
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,832
Why don't you do it, Daddy?
Wasn't that your old job?

918
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:08,309
Making people like singers
by saying nice things about 'em?

919
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,742
- Yes, baby, but...
- No, the kid's got a point there.

920
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,874
As a guy who used to
sling bullshit for a living,

921
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,385
l nominate you to go up there
and say something.

922
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:18,977
- Oh, you do, huh?
- Yeah.

923
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,853
- lt can't hurt.
- Go ahead.

924
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,257
Thanks, Pop.

925
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,921
(angry shouting)

926
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,090
(comptroller) Control yourselves!

927
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,425
He's goin' up there.

928
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,938
Folks, one second.
Please. Folks.

929
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:44,139
My name's Oliver Trinke
and l'm with the borough.

930
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,182
So l guess that makes me
the least popular guy in the room.

931
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,417
(chuckling)

932
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,384
l want to assure you that, uh...

933
00:59:56,459 --> 01:00:00,623
this Bay Avenue job will be
a very minimal inconvenience.

934
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,688
lt'll only take three days at the most.

935
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,995
Bullshit! Bullshit!

936
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,764
(murmurs of agreement)

937
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,828
(angry shouting)

938
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,809
(gavel banging)

939
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:17,573
Folks, a little decorum!
A little decorum!

940
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,222
Folks, one second.

941
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:35,060
l just have one more thing
that l just want to add.

942
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,868
l live in this town. l see you guys
headin' to work every day.

943
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,504
(music playing)

944
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,961
( Ollie) l'm telling you,
it was amazing!

945
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:21,170
And l get up there and l weave this
web of bullshit so profoundly mesmerizing,

946
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,680
- l turn the entire place around!
- You silver-tongued devil, you.

947
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:28,649
Everything l was saying
was just right on the money, you know?

948
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:32,552
Maybe that's 'cause you weren't actually
slinging as much bullshit as you thought.

949
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:35,887
''Get out there and play in the dirt''?
l mean, what... l made that up!

950
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,654
Sounds pretty good to me.
Hey, Gert.

951
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:43,028
The sad thing is, l had a greater sense of
accomplishment from the water-main thing

952
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,090
than anything else l've done
in the past seven years.

953
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,160
l get it. l mean, you set out
to do something and you did it.

954
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,831
So you feel drunk with power now.
Makes sense.

955
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:54,274
That's just it. l was the youngest flack
ever put in charge of its entire division...

956
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,742
(both) ...in the history of
MandellKirschner.

957
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,746
- l know.
- That's an accomplishment.

958
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:01,181
Convincing a town to approve something
that's already in their best interest?

959
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,742
- That's just delayed common sense.
- Yeah, but that's your life now.

960
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:08,348
l mean, being the youngest flack
in the history of blah, blah, blah...

961
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:11,825
that's not you anymore.
l mean, that might never have been you.

962
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,226
Oh, it was me.
lt was me with my own apartment,

963
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,561
me richer, me with more self-respect.

964
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,862
Like it or not, this is you.

965
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:23,269
l mean, forget about what you thought
you were and just accept who you are.

966
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:28,141
- l guess l'll just get this.
- Gert, what are you doing?

967
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:32,113
l distinctly remember your father telling you
you could get Dirty Dancing.

968
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:36,015
- Oh, yeah! He did!
- Yeah.

969
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,385
Thanks for that, by the way.

970
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:43,152
lncidentally, she's been asking me
when she's gonna grow boobies like yours.

971
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,024
- Oh, my God!
- She's seven, OK?

972
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:50,031
lf you want, l can give her the old ''boobie''
talk my mom gave me when l was a kid.

973
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,897
Does that talk include
using the word ''knockers''?

974
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,609
l'm glad there's no, you know,
awkwardness between us.

975
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:10,880
After the... well, the thing
that happened last week with...

976
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,444
Ollie, l was gonna give you a mercy jump.

977
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,685
The moment passed.
lt's no big deal.

978
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,287
- Just friends, right?
- Yeah, friends.

979
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,430
(sighs)

980
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,867
''Mercy jump.''
Stay away from my kid.

981
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:34,142
(electric saw)

982
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,747
- No, that's too round.
- Shut up.

983
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,581
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Just make it...

984
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,144
- Would you shut the hell up?!
- All right!

985
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,055
There's people gettin'
their throats cut in this thing.

986
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,422
Yep.

987
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,053
And your father said
you could do this for the show?

988
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,562
Yep.

989
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,495
Why the hell would he
OK you singing this shit?

990
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,095
Because l saw him and Maya
naked in the shower.

991
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,934
Oh, yeah.

992
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,497
Heh-heh! That'll do it.

993
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:32,728
( Ollie) Can I speak with
an Arthur Brickman, please?

994
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,777
- Ollie.
- Arthur.

995
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,838
- Hey, man.
- How're you doin'?

996
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:50,113
- Good. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

997
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:54,247
You know, the town voted unanimously,
approved the water main, so...

998
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,655
You were always great with a crowd.

999
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,820
Well, except that...
that once, of course.

1000
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,229
But that's it. lt was the polar opposite
of the Fresh Prince incident.

1001
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:09,135
lt was like l was on the top of my game.
Which is why l wanted to see ya.

1002
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:13,039
- Uh, l wanna ask you a favor.
- Anything, man. What?

1003
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:17,273
ls there any way that you could
get me an interview with your firm?

1004
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,785
You're serious?

1005
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,185
l thought it was weird
that you wanted to eat here.

1006
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,281
- Oh, l know it's gonna be tough...
- Tough?

1007
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,954
Ollie, you called a roomful of press
a bunch of jerk-offs,

1008
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,897
and trashed a client who's one of
the biggest movie stars on the planet.

1009
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,434
- He wasn't big then.
- No, but he is now.

1010
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,335
You wanna know how big?
When l left MandellKirschner,

1011
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:45,602
there were some firms that wouldn't
even look at my resume because l...

1012
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,075
No offense,
but because l worked under you.

1013
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:53,643
l've only been at Angellotti a year now...

1014
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,117
You know what, man? Forget l asked.
Don't worry about it. Seriously.

1015
01:05:57,186 --> 01:06:00,087
- lt was stupid. l got carried away...
- No, let me finish.

1016
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,681
What l was gonna say was...

1017
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:08,890
l've been waiting years to be in a position
to be able to help you out, and now l am.

1018
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,798
lt's not gonna be an easy sell, but...

1019
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:15,826
l think l can get you in a room
with Angellotti himself.

1020
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,403
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

1021
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,239
You know, you're a lot more affectionate
than l remember.

1022
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:28,113
Ah, it's just...
l miss it so much, you know?

1023
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,675
lt's the only thing
l was ever any good at.

1024
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,551
Oh, this is great.
l can move back here...

1025
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:37,023
l can put Gertie in a really good,
expensive private school...

1026
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,994
l can get her a nanny, you know?

1027
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:44,260
lt'll be like that whole Fresh Prince thing
never even happened.

1028
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:49,532
l'll work on the old man when l get back
to the office and call you tonight if it's a go.

1029
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:50,936
Oh, great.

1030
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,202
- (piano)
- ( Gertie) _ Excuse me

1031
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,004
- ( Ollie) _ Psst
- _ Dear, see to the customers

1032
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,977
- _ Psst
- _ Guess what's the...

1033
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,980
- _ Quick now!
- _ My heart's a-flutter

1034
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,948
- (phone rings)
- _ When l pound the floor

1035
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,712
_ lt's a signal to show
that l'm ready to go

1036
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,448
_ When l pound the floor...
l have to get the phone.

1037
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,423
Come on, Pop!
Do Dad's part.

1038
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,050
- Me?
- Yeah.

1039
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,719
Yeah, go do that.

1040
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,323
Hello? Hey, Arthur.

1041
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,199
You're kidding?

1042
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,708
_ l'll pound three times
Three times...

1043
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:32,407
Why do l have to sing your dad's part? l'm
supposed to be the guy who gets clipped.

1044
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:36,542
- You are, but you're Dad's understudy too.
- What the hell is that?

1045
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,849
lt means if Daddy breaks a leg,
then you do his part for him.

1046
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,719
- So, come on, try it again.
- You're doin' good.

1047
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,850
_ l'll pound three times...

1048
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,587
_ Three times!

1049
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,425
Wait, wait, wait! l'm supposed
to be the understudy now.

1050
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,964
l cannot work like this.
l'm sorry.

1051
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,126
- This is no way to run a show.
- You were good.

1052
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,568
You can go back to waiting
in the wings, Tommy Tune.

1053
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:58,163
l'll be doin' my own singing
henceforth.

1054
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,435
- Who's Tommy Tune?
- Tommy Tune is a man

1055
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:04,104
that you can get a chance to see
live and on Broadway

1056
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,876
when we move back to New York City!

1057
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,379
- What?
- What?

1058
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,283
- What?
- What?

1059
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,650
Yeah, what?

1060
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:16,714
l was just on the phone with an old friend
that l worked with at MandellKirschner.

1061
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:20,353
l had lunch with him and l asked him if he'd
get me an interview with his new firm.

1062
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:24,195
Jesus, another interview, Ollie?
Come on, when are you gonna learn?

1063
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:28,794
Well, smart guy, he just called me,
said he sat down with his boss,

1064
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,066
sold me to his boss
like l was the cure for cancer.

1065
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:35,270
lt just so happens that a little spot
has opened up in their music department.

1066
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,074
Boom!
After six years of being a pariah,

1067
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:40,206
l'm gonna get back in!

1068
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,977
l'm talkin' about
no more street sweeper,

1069
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,519
no more picking up garbage,
and no more water main!

1070
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:47,522
l'm talking press lines,
l'm talking about parties!

1071
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,990
l'm talking about a Westside address,

1072
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,152
l'm talkin' about
a good school for Gertie!

1073
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,889
But l already go to a good school.

1074
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:58,730
Yes, honey, but you're gonna go to a
way, way better school in New York City.

1075
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,395
You're gonna be able to take the
subway to school. Won't that be fun?

1076
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,665
But the subway's full of junkies
and mole-men.

1077
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,402
- Well, they are.
- Don't listen to Pop.

1078
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,502
What do l tell you?
He makes things up!

1079
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,877
- You'll see. The subways are great.
- l don't wanna see.

1080
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:16,406
l don't wanna go to a school up in the city.
l wanna go to my school.

1081
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,010
Honey, it's gonna be too far of a drive
for me to come back down here

1082
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,919
to take you to school
in New Jersey every morning.

1083
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,925
So let's not move to the city.
Let's stay here with Pop.

1084
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,929
Sweetheart, l'm too old
to be living with my father.

1085
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,090
l need to get my own place.

1086
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,464
And Pop... l mean, look at him,
he's a mad-dog.

1087
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,197
He doesn't want us around here
getting in his way, crampin' his style...

1088
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:39,298
- Do you, Pop?
- That's all horseshit.

1089
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,865
You know... thanks, Pop.

1090
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,503
l don't wanna move to the city.
l like it here.

1091
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:46,377
Pop says you can live here
as long as you want.

1092
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,076
Baby, remember when l took you
to see Sweeney Todd?

1093
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,244
How much fun was that?
We had a good time, right?

1094
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,187
l mean, if we move to New York City,
we can do that every night!

1095
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,247
Except for the nights you're working,
of course.

1096
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,293
You know what? Why don't you
shut up for a second, OK?

1097
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,487
l'm trying to talk to my daughter.

1098
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,963
You love New York City.
You told me you loved the city.

1099
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,522
- No, l didn't.
- Oh!

1100
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,591
- l said it was OK.
- Jesus Christ!

1101
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:10,799
l said l like Highlands better. Why would
you want some other job anyway, Dad?

1102
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,204
You get to ride the Batmobile!

1103
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,209
Baby, Daddy doesn't wanna
drive the Batmobile!

1104
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:18,212
Daddy wants to eat sushi!
Daddy wants to hail cabs!

1105
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,373
Daddy wants to have a doorman!

1106
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,974
Daddy wants to lord it
over magazine editors!

1107
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:28,285
Daddy loved his old job, and he's missed it
every day since he's been gone.

1108
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:32,350
Daddy wants to do that job. Daddy doesn't
wanna pick up garbage forever!

1109
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,828
But you told everybody at the meeting
that your job's good

1110
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,728
because you don't have to
wear a suit.

1111
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,997
Yes, but Daddy was just saying that
to get them to say yes to a water main.

1112
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,334
So you were just lying to everybody?

1113
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:48,603
Look, OK, l'll tell you what.
l'll go to the meeting, all right?

1114
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,168
lf l don't like what the man says,
then l won't take the job.

1115
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,578
Now you're lying to me!

1116
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,173
All right, look, young lady! l'm gonna
go to this job interview on Monday,

1117
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,377
whether you like it or not.

1118
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:57,544
Wait, this Monday?

1119
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,282
- Yes.
- Ollie, you can't go on Monday.

1120
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:03,018
- Why?
- Because that's the day of my show!

1121
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:10,521
Oh, shit.
lt is, isn't it?

1122
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:14,091
Well, it's at four,
so l can, you know, make it back in time.

1123
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,466
But my show's at five!

1124
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,801
On what planet are you gonna
get back here by five

1125
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,602
if you've got a meeting
in the city at four?

1126
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,802
Just lay off me for a second!
l forgot about the show.

1127
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:24,072
How could you forget?
What, are you stupid?

1128
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,410
Gertie, this job
is very important to Daddy.

1129
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,814
What about my show?
lsn't that important to you?

1130
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:30,784
Yes, honey,
that's even more important to me.

1131
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:34,653
Then don't go to your stupid meeting about
your stupid new job in the stupid city!

1132
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,783
- That's enough, young lady!
- l don't even want you in the show!

1133
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,623
You're not even a good
Sweeney Todd anyway.

1134
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,926
Pop's way better. Even Uncle Greenie
and Uncle Block are better than you.

1135
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,829
Those men are not your uncles!

1136
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,664
Oh, no, but we're good enough
to build sets for her show, right?

1137
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:50,227
Sorry, l didn't mean that.
Where are you going?

1138
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,833
l don't wanna be around you! l don't even
want you to come to the show to watch it.

1139
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:58,312
- Oh, come on!
- l don't! l don't even like you anymore!

1140
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,838
Get back here, young lady!
Hey! l'm talkin' to you!

1141
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,511
Hey, young lady!
Get back here, young lady!

1142
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,214
No! You can't tell me what to do!
l don't have to do anything you say!

1143
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,483
- Yes, you do!
- Why?

1144
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:09,990
Because l'm your father, that's why!

1145
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,186
- So what?
- Don't you yell at me, Gertrude!

1146
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:13,285
l'll yell at you all l want!

1147
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,853
Blah, blah, blah!
l'm not moving to the stupid city!

1148
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,991
All right, that's it! You are moving to the city
and you're gonna like it, and that's the end.

1149
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,502
l hate you!
l wish you'd died, not Mommy!

1150
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,003
l hate you right back, you little shit!

1151
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:27,007
You and your mother took my
life away and l just want it back!

1152
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,076
God, l'm sorry. l'm sorry, sweetheart.
l didn't mean...

1153
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,313
- Get off me!
- l'm sorry...

1154
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,379
Get off of me!

1155
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:51,358
What the hell's the matter with you?

1156
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,525

01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,461
_ I climbed a mountain
and I turned around

01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:29,961

- Hey.
- Hey.

1173
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:56,520
What happened to you the other night?
You just sort of took off.

1174
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:59,117
lt looked to me like you guys
needed a little privacy.

1175
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,492
What l really needed was a little backup.

1176
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,396
She's a kid, Ollie.
Kids don't weather change well.

1177
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,799
l mean, in a few years, you won't
be able to keep her out of Manhattan.

1178
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,771
But for now,
she just wants what she knows.

1179
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:11,828
So do l.

1180
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:14,102
Yeah, but is that even
what you know anymore?

1181
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,167
Oh, Jesus. You too?

1182
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:20,079
You want your old life back. Big-money job,
out of your old man's house...

1183
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,480
lt's not like it doesn't make any sense.

1184
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,751
Yeah. So?

1185
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,550
That's your life that you want back,
not theirs.

1186
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:31,582
l mean, this is their life. What you're
sort of saying to everybody who loves you

1187
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,719
is that what we have
isn't good enough for you.

1188
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:36,389
So it's just upsetting everybody,
you know?

1189
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,694
- Everybody?
- Oh... What, me?

1190
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:43,971
l mean, it's not like we've got some
big romance going on or anything.

1191
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,371
We're just friends, right?

1192
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:51,071
Did you ever wonder if...
maybe someday it might...

1193
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:55,542
be more than that?

1194
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:01,612
For about two seconds, before you
had me hiding in the shower from your kid.

1195
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,749
Look, Ollie, l like you, but...

1196
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:07,022
l'm not gonna be all heartbroken
'cause you're leaving town.

1197
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,392
l know.

1198
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,761
Even if l took this job in the city,

1199
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:16,998
l'd still come back down here
and visit my old man. And you.

1200
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:22,237
Why? l mean, you think l'm gonna
stick around here for much longer?

1201

- Maya...
- Ollie...

1202
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,947
l gotta get back to work.

1203

lf... if l don't...
if l don't see you at the show,

1204
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:38,082
give me a call sometime when
you get all settled up in the big city.

1205
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,525
Come on...

for yelling at you the other night.

any of the things that l said.

- OK.

Yes! He's expecting you, sir.

He's just a few blocks away.

and l'll let him know that you've arrived.

1265

Thank you very much.

1266
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,063
They love to keep you waiting, don't they?

1267
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:17,865
- Excuse me?
- They love to keep you waiting.

1268
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,908
Right. Yeah, yeah, they do.

1269
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:24,002
l think they think it gives them
a psychological edge, you know?

1270
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,639
Well, it's about to give 'em
the edge of my ass,

1271
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,980
'cause that's all they're gonna see
when l'm walkin' out that door.

1272
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:32,417
You know anything about these guys?

1273
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:34,955
Only that they're the fastest-growing...

1274
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,823
''...firm in the business.''
Yes, l read that article too.

1275
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,055
All right, well...
You know as much as l do.

1276
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,290
l guess that means
they know what they're doing.

1277
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:47,631
l suppose. Unless these publicists hire
other publicists to get the word out for 'em.

1278
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,103
Right. And then those publicists
hire their own publicists

1279
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:54,539
to help spin the good publicity
they created for these publicists.

1280
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:57,373
Of course, knowing publicists,
they probably hire publicists

1281
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:59,003
to promote the fact
that they spun the publicity

1282
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,846
that they hired the other publicists
to spin. So...

1283
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,751
- Oh man! So what do you do?
- l'm a publicist.

1284
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:12,053
l didn't realize l was sitting here
talking to an Angellotti man.

1285
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,722
Well, to tell you the truth,
l'm not an Angellotti man.

1286
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,129
At least not yet.
l'm here trying to get a job.

1287
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:23,227
These guys have been tryin' to steal me
from my publicist since my last flick.

1288
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,274
- Oh, the robot movie, right?
- Oh, yeah, you saw it?

1289
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,639
l haven't gotten around to it yet.
l'm gonna...

1290
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,110
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot
for the support though, man.

1291
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:35,081
- l wanna see it...
- You know what? lt's not that good.

1292
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,846
l have a kid. l don't get a chance
to get out and see movies

1293
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,080
unless they have singing crabs in 'em.

1294
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:42,851
Singing crabs? l saw that one.
That means you have a girl.

1295
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,391
That's right.

1296
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,518
- How old is she?
- She's seven.

1297
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:49,154
Yeah? Cool.
l got a girl and two boys.

1298
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,130
Three kids?

1299
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,929
God. How do you find time
to make all those blockbusters?

1300
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:55,526
Shoot, if l didn't have
all them damn kids,

1301
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,468
l wouldn't have to
make these blockbusters.

1302
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,234
Right.

1303
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,298
Oh, man.

1304
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,936
- lt's cool, though, isn't it?
- Making blockbusters?

1305
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:08,676
- You tell me.
- Bein' a parent, funny man.

1306
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,453
lt has its moments.

1307
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,886
- What's your daughter's name?
- Gertrude.

1308
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,816
Damn!
Why'd you do that to that girl, man?

1309
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,028
- Did you lose a bet?
- No.

1310
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:25,362
- No, it was my wife's name.
- ''Was''? OK, let me guess.

1311
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:29,802
She took you for half after she
saddled the kid with the name Gert?

1312
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:33,466
l can't blame it on her.
l saddled the kid with the name Gert.

1313
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,601
She died in childbirth. So...

1314
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:41,110
- No, no, no, it's...
- l feel like an asshole, man.

1315
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:44,583
- Don't worry about it.
- No, listen, l'm really sorry about that.

1316
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:49,112
l didn't see your movie,
so we're even. Trust me.

1317
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:53,183
This is exactly why people don't talk
to each other in waiting rooms, right?

1318
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,230
Probably.
Although, l gotta tell ya...

1319
01:23:56,297 --> 01:24:00,597
the fact that the guy who wrote ''Parents
Just Don't Understand'' is now a parent

1320
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,068
completely makes up for it.

1321
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,463
Oh, man.
We don't though, do we?

1322
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,735
- What's that?
- Understand.

1323
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:12,337
l mean, these kids today.
From the door, man, they got it all over us.

1324
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:16,213
My daughter has it all over me,
l can tell you that.

1325
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:17,808
Yeah, my middle one, my son?

1326
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,446
Every time l walk out of the house
in the morning

1327
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,854
he says,
''Daddy, how far you love me?''

1328
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:25,688
l always pick somewhere close.
''l love you to that table, man.''

1329
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,094
''No, you don't. You love me all the way
to the moon and back down to the dirt.''

1330
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,328
That's great.

1331
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,494
lt take everything l got
to walk out of that house.

1332
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,630
You get to spend time with them
on the set though, right?

1333
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:43,006
Oh, yeah. But if l was a smart man,
l wouldn't be sittin' here right now.

1334
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:46,741
l'd be at home
playing in the dirt with my kids.

1335
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,417
But we all know that l'm not famous
'cause of my brains.

1336

- Oh, hey, you too, man.

- You out?
- l'm out.

Hey, you recommend these guys?

1343
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:23,413
Uh... only guy l can recommend
is named Arthur Brickman.

1344
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,544
Other than that,
l can't vouch for anybody.

1345
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,714
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
You Brickman?

1346

Pinch my cheeks, kids' show or not,

01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:04,563
That was just about
the most romantic thing l've ever seen.

1458
01:35:06,133 --> 01:35:08,533
Honestly.

1459
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:11,537
Well... stick around.

1460
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,998
lt may get even
more romantic than that.

1461
01:35:16,077 --> 01:35:18,807
- Really?
- Yeah.

1462
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:25,512
See? How was that for romance?

1463
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:31,584
l'll think about it.

1464
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,555
Do that.

1465
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:38,592
Ollie Trinke...

1466
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:04,285
Hey.

1467
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:07,660
Your kid's cuttin' a rug with that Maya.

1468
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:10,320
Uh...

1469
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:16,535
The sun even shines
on a dog's ass some days.

1470
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:19,665
You getting a dog?

1471
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:27,576
Maya?

1472
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:31,049
- Can l dance with my dad now?
- lf you must.

1473
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:34,645
Don't let him go, though, Gert.
He's one of a kind.

1474
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,315
l know.

1475
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:42,621
Come here.

1476
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:45,563
- You wanna dance?
- So, no city?

1477
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:49,832
- No. No city.
- We're staying here with Pop?

1478
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:53,602
God help us, yes,
we're staying with Pop.

1479
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:58,608
- And you're taking me to see Cats?
- Oh-ho! Nice try, but no.

1480
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:03,642
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Anything for you, Gert.

1481
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:07,621
- You know why?
- Why?

1482
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:11,352
'Cause you're the only thing
l was ever really good at.

(_ ''Jersey Girl'' by Bruce Springsteen)

1484
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:28,562
_ I got no time for the corner boys

1485
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:34,574
_ Down in the street
making all that noise

1486
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:39,911
_ Or the girls out on the avenue

1487
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:47,985
_ 'Cause tonight I wanna be with you

1488
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:52,253
_ Tonight I'm gonna take that ride

1489
01:38:53,327 --> 01:38:58,094
_ Across the river to the Jersey side

1490
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:03,129
_ Take my baby to the carnival

1491
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:11,135
_ Then I'll take her on all the rides

1492
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:16,706
_ 'Cause down the shore
everything's all right

1493
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:22,245
_ You and your baby
on a Saturday night

1494
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:27,187
_ You know all my dreams come true

1495

in my baby's arms

that she'll wear my ring

1508

I ain't got no time
