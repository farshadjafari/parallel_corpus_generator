1
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,993
300 Guineas.

2
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,134
Now Ladies and Gentlemen,
who would start with 300 Guineas -

3
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,503
for this magnificent pair of tusks?

4
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:35,477
Oh, please! Ladies
and gentlemen, 300 Guineas!

5
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:38,144
This ivory is exceptional!

6
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:43,145
As you know, offer for sale
by Mr Aidan McRory himself

7
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:46,250
It must guaranty
it's museum quality.

8
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:51,774
Very well Should we say 200 Guineas?
Do I hear 200 Guineas?

9
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:55,476
Isn't that McRory overthere?
At the back.

10
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,423
I just love the way he looks.
The great white hunter.

11
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:05,521
Introduce me. Go on,
I want to live dangerously.

12
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,880
Not that dangerously.

13
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:11,609
Besides he's not well manered.
He isn't having a very good morning.

14
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,034
Surely, 150 Guineas?

15
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:19,624
No? No one?

16
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,243
Not sold.

17
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:30,554
With our next lot number 38, we leave
Africa, and journey to Southeast Asia.

18
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:37,578
This is a 13th century sandstone
Buddha from the upper Mihcong region.

19
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:40,591
I'll start the
bidding at 200 Guineas.

20
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:43,956
270 Guineas at the back.
Thank you, sir

21
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:46,689
300! 350 on my left.

22
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,103
400 in front.

23
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,182
450 on my right.

24
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,622
500! 550 on my left.

25
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,958
600! 700 in front.
850 at the back.

26
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,637
900! 900 Guineas.

27
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,331
950!

28
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:10,081
950 Guineas. Sold to the gentleman
at the back. Congratulations!

29
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:14,045
We've now come to the next lot.

30
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,092
This is a statue dated back
to late 12th Century...

31
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,942
Beautiful statue here.

32
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:10,135
Big money, but too heavy.

33
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:16,398
Just take the head.

34
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,451
Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!

35
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:04,994
Run! Run!

36
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,177
The rifle!

37
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:09,543
Bring those too.

38
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:17,178
We've lost it. Let's go back.

39
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:31,801
What's the bounty for a tiger
in these parts?

40
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:35,408
150 Piasters.

41
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,444
I'll see that you get it.

42
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:44,759
Clear this out.

43
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:05,278
I'm warning you. You bite me
I'll bite you back.

44
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,705
All right?

45
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:13,336
Yeah, drink some of this.
You'll like it.

46
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:17,131
Look, look.

47
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:19,218
See, it's nice.

48
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:25,469
Come on. Try a little bit more.

49
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:31,816
You can't make war on the
entire world. Did you?

50
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:05,890
Am I going to get that hand back
or I'm going to lose it?

51
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:12,146
You'd like to keep that hand
forever, don't you think?

52
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:28,457
You like that?

53
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:31,129
Yeah, have a little of this.

54
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:33,633
They are honey drops.

55
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:35,859
My favorite.

56
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:40,181
Umm, nice, uh?

57
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:55,518
My father, the Chief,
in the name of the village

58
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,769
thanks you for
killing the tiger.

59
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,004
Tigers bring death.

60
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:02,712
They kill all of our buffalos,
our chickens, our people.

61
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,163
We honour you for the
death of our enemy.

62
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:07,527
After all the help he's given me
I'm glad to be of service.

63
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:10,744
Will you tell the Chief, next year,
if I return for these statues -

64
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,746
I'll need his assistance again.

65
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,014
I know I can count
on his friendship and discretion.

66
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:31,643
The Chief says, discretion is
the Oriental's virtue.

67
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:34,300
Of course. Well to thank
him for all he's done,

68
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,526
please tell your father
I'll give him the hide.

69
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,132
The Chief says he'd rather
have them alive.

70
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:47,402
No, I meant the big tiger,
the dead one.

71
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:56,545
The Chief says, the dead
one is also welcome.

72
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:59,259
He thanks you very much
for both tigers.

73
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,226
No, I don't think
you understand.

74
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,430
Can I help you, Captain?

75
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,853
Sergeant Van Tranh.
Second district.

76
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,901
What do I see here?

77
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,646
Pretty subject
i a safari outfit.

78
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:22,524
I see sacred statues
stolen from the temples.

79
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:25,114
Is that what you see?

80
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:27,950
I see blocks of old stone
found in the jungle.

81
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:32,293
In that case, in accordance
with section 12, subsection 211 -

82
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:34,631
of the Mineral Resources Act.

83
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:40,050
I request you
show me your hands.

84
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:58,689
Follow me.

85
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:11,751
A tiger attacked him
and he lost his leg.

86
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:12,717
On your way.

87
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:16,086
He gives you this charm to thank
you as asign of him gratitude.

88
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:16,836
Go.

89
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:18,438
It will bring you luck.

90
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,976
Looks like I might need it.

91
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:43,293
The Administrator thanks you for
reporting the statue thief.

92
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,194
We know our lord by
the gift he brings.

93
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:04,579
Where have you put him?

94
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:07,088
In the general holding cell,
Mr Administrator.

95
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:09,721
Very good. Has he had
anything to eat?

96
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,391
I gave him some porridge
but he wouldn't touch it.

97
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:14,093
Good, very good.

98
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:16,052
Of course, you took his
shoelaces away?

99
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:18,594
Yes. We've done everything you
asked, Mr Administrator.

100
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,353
Splendid!

101
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:22,979
I don't believe it.

102
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:25,649
The famous Aidan
McRory in prison.

103
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:30,656
What a ludicrous day...

104
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:31,620
Why didn't they tell me
you were here?

105
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,663
Open.

106
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:35,863
Forgive me.
But I am Eugen Normandin.

107
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:40,453
The Administrator
of this district.

108
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:45,250
It's absurd. Open.

109
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:49,348
Aidan McRory in
this terrible place.

110
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:51,637
My son knows all
of your books.

111
00:33:51,684 --> 00:33:55,765
"The Lion Hunt."
"The Ivory Trader."

112
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:58,473
My wife
she reads them to him.

113
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:06,290
Don't tell me you took
his shoelaces, you imbecile.

114
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,248
You must be more
careful in future.

115
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:14,376
This little escapade
could have cost you...

116
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:15,419
Three years.

117
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,505
You see.

118
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:22,018
As for the statues, I'll tell you what,
give me two or three of them -

119
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:23,208
just for the look of the thing.

120
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:26,372
I will send them
to some museum back home.

121
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:27,989
That will calm things down.

122
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,033
As for the rest,
we'll call them... souvenirs.

123
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:45,156
Listen I don't know
how to thank you.

124
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:47,323
My boat sails tomorrow. I thought I'd
be stuck here for another two months.

125
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:48,337
Tomorrow?

126
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:52,207
We can not permit Mr McRory
to leave the country yet.

127
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:54,292
Not until the paper
work is finished.

128
00:34:54,337 --> 00:34:56,838
Oh, I feel terribly.

129
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,835
No need for that.

130
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:03,508
It's a relief just be out
of that place. I'm grateful.

131
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:06,622
Really? Really, Really.

132
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:11,347
That gives me the courage
to make a request.

133
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:15,189
You see. It seems
almost supernaturally -

134
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,981
that a great hunter like you should be
sent to me just at this moment.

135
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,049
Meet the man-eater.

136
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,290
If you have no objection, I think
we'll call you Kumar.

137
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:52,848
For your information, I am Zerbino.

138
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:59,107
World famous animal tamer and director
of the great Zerbino Circus.

139
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,915
Madame Zerbino and still cooking in
the oven, my son.

140
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:08,493
This fire-eating sword swallower is
the fearsome Saladin.

141
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,130
Where did you find him?

142
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,922
In the toy department?

143
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:13,674
He's fierce enough.
Don't you worry.

144
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:15,751
Let me see.

145
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:20,398
I told you. Some toy, huh?

146
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:30,267
The sooner you learn it's not tigers
who run the show the better for you.

147
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:55,537
All right. Close it up.

148
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,627
The village is grateful that
you come back again.

149
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:02,681
I'm grateful for the opportunity
to see you again.

150
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:07,094
They think you will rid the
region of the tigers.

151
00:40:07,144 --> 00:40:10,763
To thank you, my father wants to
show you the temples up river -

152
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:12,601
where there are many statues.

153
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,310
Aren't those very far away?

154
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,484
No. Not too far.
About two week's walk.

155
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:21,491
Where did you learn
your English?

156
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:24,806
His Excellency asked the Australian
priests to open a school here.

157
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:26,855
To teach us languages.

158
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:31,623
I'm very impressed.
What else do they teach you?

159
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,083
To be aware of white man.

160
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,069
- Well...
- Mr. Administrator.

161
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:58,564
We have one tiger. Caught in
our trap yesterday morning.

162
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:00,029
Oh. Is one enough?

163
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:03,494
That will depend on your guest
with his shooting rifle.

164
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,293
His Excellency's father
was a great hunter.

165
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:07,752
Indeed, his father has
many qualities.

166
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:11,840
But a great number of them
appear to be puerility.

167
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:14,754
I see, you are
admiring my scheme.

168
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:15,965
Impressive, isn't it?

169
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:17,008
Yes.

170
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:19,850
Soon you want me to break up these
temples and ship them to London.

171
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:23,385
London will come
here to see them.

172
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,395
The future is tourism, McRory.

173
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:30,683
And my role is going to
make it happen.

174
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:33,987
Poor Mr McRory.

175
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:38,621
If you have to bore the poor man
there's plenty left of the day.

176
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,115
You might have waited until
he had some lunch?

177
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,406
My wife, Matild.

178
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:46,159
My dear. May I introduce
Aidan McRory -

179
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,006
who so kindly offer to organize
the hunt for His Excellency.

180
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,210
I know who he is, darling.

181
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,263
I take it you don't support
the road then.

182
00:41:54,263 --> 00:42:00,516
I support any thing that will get me
out of this God forsaken hole.

183
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:05,734
So mind you, make
a success of the hunt.

184
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:10,563
If His Excellency agrees to let the
new road to cross the land -

185
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:13,284
it could be our
ticket back to Paris.

186
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:14,443
I'll do my best.

187
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,112
Good.

188
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:21,702
And if you succeed...
You may choose your own reward.

189
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:03,333
Champagne! Champagne!

190
00:43:04,027 --> 00:43:06,075
Gather up! Attention!

191
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:12,156
Champagne, open it in the name of God.
The Choir! Get the choir ready!

192
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:15,075
Music! Music!

193
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:24,250
I thought about your father's offer
to see the temples up river.

194
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:28,042
I'm told the statues are more
beautiful than any I've seen yet.

195
00:43:28,222 --> 00:43:30,550
I wondered as it appears I am
staying on for a while.

196
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,309
You think, perhaps I could persuade
you to act as my guide?

197
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:38,378
You see I really would need
someone who speaks English.

198
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:39,683
They are here. Come on.

199
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,926
What is it now, my dear?

200
00:44:16,648 --> 00:44:18,316
I've broken my heal.

201
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:31,938
Who's the lady from France?

202
00:44:32,808 --> 00:44:35,762
We found her in Paris
dancing at the Moulin Rouge.

203
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:39,202
Eugen thinks she might win His
Excellence over to our point of view.

204
00:44:39,202 --> 00:44:41,160
But... I doubt it.

205
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,309
Are you all right?

206
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:09,555
Ah, yes. It's just the swing.

207
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:12,523
It reminds me of
being at sea.

208
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:18,736
What?

209
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,063
For God's sake
shut him up!

210
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,829
No. He's so happy.
He's going hunting.

211
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,418
Bravo!

212
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:12,465
As Your Excellency's
father always said.

213
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:15,517
One shot one kill.

214
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:18,539
I am not my father.

215
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:21,645
Of course,
but you shoot like him.

216
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:25,740
With you, it's pff bang!
Straight as arrow.

217
00:48:26,158 --> 00:48:29,645
Straight as your road through the
sacred jungle of my ancestors.

218
00:48:39,802 --> 00:48:41,158
Come on. Come on.

219
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:38,321
The beast can't
travel very far.

220
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:42,616
She must be dead by now.

221
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:44,617
We'll send you this kitten.

222
00:49:44,662 --> 00:49:45,942
I'm sure you will.

223
00:49:45,996 --> 00:49:52,201
Yeah.

224
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:03,349
You know, if we had taken him fishing
he would have fallen overboard.

225
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:07,181
That sounds like Bitsy.
Bitsy!

226
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:09,601
Where is he?
Where is Bitsy?

227
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:12,139
And Raoul? Eugen,
where is Raoul?

228
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:12,892
For God's sake!

229
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:19,148
Raoul!

230
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:39,844
Don't be afraid.

231
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:46,597
Five, four
three, two, one.

232
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:51,725
Ready or not
here I come.

233
00:50:51,987 --> 00:50:53,707
Sangha.

234
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,978
I see you Sangha.

235
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,548
We had to rid the village of that
blood-thirsty monster.

236
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:31,435
And our chance came
sooner than expected.

237
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,363
We had just set off -

238
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:39,654
when suddenly, there was
a movement in the rocks...

239
00:51:41,479 --> 00:51:45,787
With no time to aim, I brought the
gun to my shoulder and fired.

240
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:51,437
The bullet struck the man-eater
full in the chest and with a thud it fell.

241
00:51:54,994 --> 00:51:58,963
The beast rolled over and
stared at me with it's green eyes -

242
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:02,782
extending and retracting it's claws
in final throes of death.

243
00:52:03,759 --> 00:52:07,308
We stood there silent before
the magnificent creature,

244
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:11,791
and then, according to custom,
I cut open the chest -

245
00:52:11,822 --> 00:52:15,812
and gave the warm streaming
heart to my client.

246
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:37,309
Good night, Raoul.

247
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,059
Good night, Sangha.

248
00:52:40,107 --> 00:52:46,312
Pleasent dreams
my darlings.

249
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:18,578
Kumar.
Kumar, eat.

250
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:21,808
He's going to die.

251
00:53:21,862 --> 00:53:25,729
You must eat, Kumar.

252
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:31,026
This is good meat.

253
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,705
Come on, my boy.

254
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:36,243
It's no use telling him.
Make him eat.

255
00:53:36,294 --> 00:53:37,493
We spent good money on him.

256
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:41,166
We'd better find the old Chinaman
who stuff that jackal for us.

257
00:53:41,253 --> 00:53:43,466
At that size
it would sell well.

258
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:46,318
For a mantelpiece
or a library.

259
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:08,937
Ladies and gentlemen.

260
00:55:08,981 --> 00:55:10,606
The moment you
have been waiting for!

261
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:14,246
The great Zerbino Circus is proud
to present it's audience -

262
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:17,156
with a savage killer!

263
00:55:19,743 --> 00:55:22,661
Out there you lazy old lump.

264
00:55:22,704 --> 00:55:24,910
Time to go to work.

265
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:27,877
Move.

266
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,797
He's an embarrassment
for the show.

267
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:32,505
We should get rid of him.

268
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:34,209
But who would buy him?

269
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:37,797
At his age, he's not
worth a cent!

270
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:41,742
Not even a Vietnamese butcher
would take him now.

271
00:55:46,773 --> 00:55:49,311
Let's go! Move.

272
00:55:49,568 --> 00:55:53,840
Get ready! For I give you...
Bloody Caesar.

273
00:55:55,449 --> 00:55:58,154
You are a
ferocious beast.

274
00:55:58,202 --> 00:56:00,487
So act like one!

275
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:06,784
So how are you enjoying
your extended stay?

276
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:08,130
Very much.

277
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:12,551
I heard you are keeping
yourself entertained.

278
00:56:12,593 --> 00:56:17,099
Does this mean we can hope you to stay
longer in our beautiful colony?

279
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:22,140
Since you have plenty to do.

280
00:56:22,187 --> 00:56:26,850
Someone said you were asking
about the river region.

281
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:30,238
Of course, there's
wonderful temples there.

282
00:56:30,238 --> 00:56:32,445
But I must warn you.

283
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,990
Sergent Van Tranh is getting
very hot under the collar.

284
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:38,642
That can't be too plesant for him.

285
00:56:39,832 --> 00:56:43,601
I wonder if it would make
it easier for you -

286
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:47,415
if you have some sort of
feature hat to wear.

287
00:56:47,465 --> 00:56:52,591
Special adviser for hunting...
And the protection of flora.

288
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:53,918
How does it sound?

289
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:55,550
Rather long.

290
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,094
What might that involve
do you think?

291
00:56:57,351 --> 00:56:58,976
Nothing much.

292
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,852
You could organize the tiger hunt
whenever I have important visitors.

293
00:57:02,899 --> 00:57:04,394
Very kind of you.

294
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:07,780
How on earth can I
thank you this time?

295
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,983
I need the skin
of that tigers.

296
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:13,525
His Excellency is being very difficult
about the road again.

297
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:16,781
It's because he lost
faith during the hunt.

298
00:57:16,831 --> 00:57:20,960
How do we present him with the skin
when the live tiger's still inside it?

299
00:57:21,003 --> 00:57:24,753
You are the hunter.
Figure it out.

300
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:28,629
I have an appointment with
His Excellency next Tuesday.

301
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,765
I cannot go empty handed.

302
00:57:31,765 --> 00:57:34,893
Don't be ridiculous.
That's impossible.

303
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:37,266
Oh, you can do it.

304
00:57:37,313 --> 00:57:41,544
Otherwise, I may not be able
to restrain the Sergeant.

305
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:47,185
He says you have acquired an
accomplice. Some local girl.

306
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:50,991
You rang, Madame.

307
00:57:55,437 --> 00:57:57,727
- Sangha!
- Bitsy!

308
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:20,058
Hello?

309
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:45,094
Hey, I know you.

310
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:48,934
So this is where they
brought you, huh?

311
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:51,098
Well, it's not so bad.

312
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,724
At least you got company.

313
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,043
Don't you look at me like that.

314
00:58:59,738 --> 00:59:02,206
What was I supposed to
do with you?

315
00:59:02,532 --> 00:59:05,915
I couldn't have left
you out there, could I?

316
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,682
You never learned to hunt.
You would starve to death.

317
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:13,597
It's a pity to get
eaten right away.

318
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:21,185
You get a long memory
I know what you want.

319
00:59:28,228 --> 00:59:29,224
Ah, ah, ah!

320
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:32,628
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

321
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:35,194
Even at that age, they can
take your finger off.

322
00:59:35,277 --> 00:59:38,059
I've heard you keep the skins of your
animals after they are dead.

323
00:59:38,114 --> 00:59:39,293
Sometimes.

324
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,176
You wouldn't happen to have
a tiger hide by any chance?

325
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:42,420
Tiger skin? I'm afr--

326
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:44,173
We can get you a tiger skin!

327
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:47,282
Good. Can I see it?

328
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,418
When do you need it?

329
00:59:49,522 --> 00:59:50,892
Tomorrow.

330
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,269
Tomorrow?

331
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,745
Then you can see it tomorrow.
It will cost you 1000 Piasters.

332
00:59:57,769 --> 00:59:59,219
Payable in advance.

333
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,932
I don't want it finished
in gold leaf.

334
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:04,803
That's the price.
It's up to you.

335
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:09,023
Do you want the
skin or not?

336
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:13,588
If you do, 1000 Piasters.
If you don't, get lost.

337
01:00:15,197 --> 01:00:19,532
All right. Spend some of it on
this little one, won't you?

338
01:00:19,785 --> 01:00:22,006
Feed him well.

339
01:00:22,163 --> 01:00:25,760
Happens to be a
friend of mine.

340
01:00:47,484 --> 01:00:48,735
Come on!

341
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:07,689
What are you crying about?
You've been promoted.

342
01:01:27,444 --> 01:01:28,724
You shouldn't be sad.

343
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:31,899
You were right not to leave
little tiger in the jungle.

344
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:34,743
It would have grown up
a man-eater.

345
01:01:34,743 --> 01:01:36,404
I suppose.

346
01:01:36,454 --> 01:01:37,872
You are a hunter.

347
01:01:37,872 --> 01:01:40,114
You protect people
from wild animals.

348
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:43,417
It is good to care for them,
not to pity them.

349
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:45,620
It's exactly what
I used to think.

350
01:01:45,714 --> 01:01:48,984
For me, hunting is
a noble occupation.

351
01:01:50,243 --> 01:01:53,044
I think it's also a noble occupation
to share treasures of your countries -

352
01:01:53,097 --> 01:01:55,942
to people who don't know
anything about them.

353
01:01:56,643 --> 01:01:58,780
Wouldn't you agree?

354
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:05,342
My father agrees.
If you give him money.

355
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:12,443
Nobody sees the statues here. They're
just left to decay in the jungle.

356
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:16,539
The jungle is their home.
This is where they live.

357
01:02:16,582 --> 01:02:20,482
It's also where tigers live, but you
don't mind hunting them.

358
01:02:26,301 --> 01:02:28,845
Do you remember the young
man who gave you this?

359
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:33,544
The one who lost
his leg to a tiger?

360
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:39,201
He's my brother.

361
01:02:52,497 --> 01:02:54,074
May I please,
Your Excellency?

362
01:02:54,123 --> 01:02:57,943
But your father always prefers to show
the death wound in the photograph.

363
01:02:58,337 --> 01:03:00,777
I am not my father.

364
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:07,680
So, where is the hole?

365
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:12,301
Here. Isn't that amazing?

366
01:03:12,352 --> 01:03:16,302
Absolutely amazing. And very
meticulous on their part.

367
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:20,580
Unfortunately the animal I shot
was hit in the other ear.

368
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:38,996
So gentlemen, the sacred statues will
no longer need to leave their temples -

369
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:42,172
and migrate to Paris.

370
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:48,423
Why? Because Paris...

371
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:20,917
Would you mind
holding that?

372
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,227
Sangha! Sangha!
Sangha. Bitsy.

373
01:04:46,624 --> 01:04:48,118
Help!

374
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:49,792
I want him out
of the house!

375
01:04:49,877 --> 01:04:52,416
But mom, he's mine!

376
01:04:52,464 --> 01:04:57,173
Get him out of here!

377
01:04:57,219 --> 01:04:59,377
Don't touch him!

378
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:04,352
Mom, I need him.

379
01:05:04,352 --> 01:05:05,098
Stop.

380
01:05:05,144 --> 01:05:06,969
Don't touch him!

381
01:05:09,774 --> 01:05:14,062
He was only playing!
I know he was only playing, mom!

382
01:05:22,484 --> 01:05:24,883
Stand back from that monster!

383
01:05:33,634 --> 01:05:34,781
Sangha!

384
01:05:50,737 --> 01:05:54,280
He has a taste for blood now.
We can't keep him.

385
01:05:55,158 --> 01:05:57,780
Raoul, calm down.

386
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,930
Ok, it's over.

387
01:05:59,976 --> 01:06:01,488
Sangha!

388
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:05,935
Sangha!

389
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,724
I am in charge of the Palace.

390
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:26,561
It's a gift for His Excellency
in the name of France.

391
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,930
Is he really a savage as
the Administrator said?

392
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:57,432
You would ask if you had
seen what he did to the dog.

393
01:06:57,478 --> 01:07:01,284
Excellent! It will fit in well
with our collection.

394
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:32,166
Jump Kumar! You can do it!
Come on! You're a big boy now!

395
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:37,039
Jump! Come on, big boy. Come on.

396
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:43,051
You can do it, Kumar! It's easy.
You won't be hurt.

397
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:46,126
Go right through it. You'll
be all right. You'll see.

398
01:07:46,282 --> 01:07:47,548
Just jump.

399
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:50,303
One little jump.

400
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,764
Kumar, trust me.

401
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:57,918
Come on!

402
01:07:58,003 --> 01:08:04,208
Jump!

403
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:15,285
I said jump, not beg.
You stupid animal! Come on.

404
01:08:15,502 --> 01:08:18,835
It's time to try
something different.

405
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,992
How dare you!

406
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,364
Back, back.

407
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:30,243
Come on everybody.

408
01:08:31,283 --> 01:08:32,750
Everyone in here. Now!

409
01:08:37,218 --> 01:08:38,792
Come on! This way! This way!

410
01:08:39,763 --> 01:08:41,510
Get him! Get him!

411
01:08:44,138 --> 01:08:46,763
Now we are going to
teach you some manners.

412
01:09:06,955 --> 01:09:09,093
Now you jump.

413
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,581
Go.

414
01:09:37,727 --> 01:09:42,066
That wasn't so hard.
That's how you break a tiger.

415
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:34,004
Is the tiger really
ferocious?

416
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:37,826
Why don't you test it if you have
a spare arm or leg?

417
01:10:38,182 --> 01:10:40,516
Here's the key to his cage.

418
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:43,370
My master is mounting a festival.

419
01:10:44,668 --> 01:10:48,776
It is to be organized exactly as it
was in the time of his late father.

420
01:10:49,236 --> 01:10:51,613
Have you heard of
these ceremonies?

421
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:52,865
Of course.

422
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:55,784
What animal would
he be against?

423
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,160
A savage one.

424
01:10:57,203 --> 01:11:00,537
We have the best fighting beast
I've ever known in captivity.

425
01:11:00,582 --> 01:11:02,719
We want an opponent that
is worthy of him.

426
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:05,642
A special beast
means a special price.

427
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:07,524
5000 Piasters.

428
01:11:13,805 --> 01:11:15,285
He'd better be worth it.

429
01:11:15,598 --> 01:11:16,849
He is.

430
01:11:16,996 --> 01:11:20,385
Let us know when to
stop feeding him.

431
01:11:46,704 --> 01:11:47,831
Are they real?

432
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:51,023
Of course. Everything
about my father was real.

433
01:11:50,616 --> 01:11:53,640
If rather overdone for
modern taste.

434
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:58,099
And will it be just as
it was in your fathers days?

435
01:11:58,608 --> 01:11:59,650
Precisely.

436
01:12:00,223 --> 01:12:03,042
The French wants to show people that
everything is the same as it used to be.

437
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:06,400
Isn't that wonderful?

438
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:10,214
That they have such respect
for his traditions.

439
01:12:11,235 --> 01:12:15,115
They only want to show that everything
is the same to hide that it's different.

440
01:12:15,221 --> 01:12:18,037
They patronize me
with their admiration -

441
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:20,852
so they can corner me after
the ceremony to sign the contract -

442
01:12:21,116 --> 01:12:23,601
for their damn road.

443
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:31,440
Why are you against this road?
I just don't understand.

444
01:12:31,754 --> 01:12:33,274
What's wrong with it?

445
01:12:36,555 --> 01:12:41,136
Don't worry. I will tell them you did
everything in your power to persude me.

446
01:13:04,595 --> 01:13:06,634
Was he born ferocious?

447
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,385
He was a very shy animal
when he arrived here.

448
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:13,638
Full of fear. It's always fear that
makes us into killers.

449
01:13:13,897 --> 01:13:15,826
Why did they call him Sangha?

450
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:19,580
The Administrator's
child named him.

451
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,867
Leave me.

452
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:28,154
Your Excellency.
He's very dangerous.

453
01:13:28,308 --> 01:13:29,716
Leave me.

454
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:49,119
Do you remember your father,
Sangha?

455
01:13:50,312 --> 01:13:53,767
Was he a great lord
of the jungle?

456
01:13:55,714 --> 01:13:57,122
Mine was.

457
01:13:57,904 --> 01:14:01,736
Did all the creatures
shrink in his shadow?

458
01:14:01,783 --> 01:14:04,234
That's how was with mine.

459
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:11,554
Was yours disappointed
in his son?

460
01:14:15,382 --> 01:14:17,937
No. Perhaps yours was not.

461
01:14:31,691 --> 01:14:35,448
So you too think one must
be cruel in this world.

462
01:14:35,612 --> 01:14:39,571
That one must be cruel to
gain respect.

463
01:15:00,557 --> 01:15:01,683
We've got him.

464
01:15:01,892 --> 01:15:04,812
He's promised to sign
at the end of the ceremony.

465
01:15:04,812 --> 01:15:08,140
Once his name is on
the dotted line...

466
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:11,476
If I faint with the first sight
of blood, don't say I didn't warn you.

467
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:13,520
If I were you
I would get used to it.

468
01:15:13,613 --> 01:15:17,232
Because if I am appointed
as we hope.

469
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:21,199
Remember there's a
bullfight every something.

470
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:24,427
It could happen.
It could be my tiger.

471
01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:35,364
Think about it.
It's possible.

472
01:15:35,408 --> 01:15:39,423
Raoul, stop it.
It won't be your tiger.

473
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:50,066
You wait here for me.

474
01:16:07,068 --> 01:16:10,297
Bloody hell.
It is you, isn't it?

475
01:16:14,097 --> 01:16:15,592
I am so sorry.

476
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,705
Don't you recognized me?

477
01:16:20,104 --> 01:16:21,936
I'm not the one who's changed.

478
01:16:27,654 --> 01:16:29,756
Looking for another
tiger skin?

479
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,694
That one is not for sale.

480
01:16:32,743 --> 01:16:34,819
No. But it soon will be.

481
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,642
You know His Excellency's
tiger is a wild beast.

482
01:16:37,686 --> 01:16:40,668
Yours on the other hand is a poodle.
He's been trained to sit up and beg.

483
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:42,370
So he'll be torn to pieces.

484
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,233
How dare you lecture us?
Who do you think you are?

485
01:16:45,278 --> 01:16:46,713
So one tiger will die.

486
01:16:46,758 --> 01:16:50,626
But every penny we earned from it will
be spent on keeping the rest alive.

487
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:54,049
I asked you to take care of him.
Not send him to the slaughter.

488
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,176
You are the hunter, not us.

489
01:16:56,332 --> 01:16:59,825
You are the one
who get rich by killing.

490
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:05,398
Give us the key, you imbecile.

491
01:17:05,446 --> 01:17:08,613
I'll buy him from you. I'll match
whatever they paid for him.

492
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:10,368
You couldn't afford it.

493
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:12,340
The key.

494
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,992
Come on boys!

495
01:17:18,377 --> 01:17:19,785
Give us the key.

496
01:17:52,415 --> 01:17:54,553
I'm finished here. Let's go.

497
01:18:29,477 --> 01:18:31,079
Sangha. It's him.

498
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:34,039
It's Sangha, mama!
It's Sangha. It's him!

499
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:35,682
- How could it be?
- I am sure.

500
01:18:35,755 --> 01:18:37,978
- You know very well he's in the zoo.
- He's in Bangkok.

501
01:18:37,978 --> 01:18:40,945
Whatever.
He's a thousand miles away.

502
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:56,756
Move, Kumar.
It's time to go to work.

503
01:19:03,682 --> 01:19:06,013
You are a ferocious beast.

504
01:19:06,164 --> 01:19:07,970
So act like one!

505
01:19:10,627 --> 01:19:13,286
God come with you
my brother.

506
01:19:31,525 --> 01:19:33,234
Go on, Kumar.

507
01:19:34,272 --> 01:19:35,519
Go!

508
01:22:08,471 --> 01:22:11,625
Get some stones.
Stop them playing.

509
01:22:20,943 --> 01:22:24,204
Get them scared! Get them angry!
Get them fighting!

510
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:29,475
Come on Kumar!
Fight! Fight!

511
01:22:33,498 --> 01:22:37,618
What's the matter with you?
What do you think you're doing?

512
01:22:45,637 --> 01:22:48,031
The gun! Give me the gun!

513
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:13,053
The door!
Closing that gate!

514
01:23:18,945 --> 01:23:20,770
Get him away.

515
01:23:33,045 --> 01:23:34,921
Go! Come on! Run, Sangha, Run!

516
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,783
Oh, thank God.

517
01:28:12,647 --> 01:28:14,374
I was not sure
you'd come.

518
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,856
No, I'm told I was
thinking selfishly.

519
01:28:17,006 --> 01:28:17,995
Thank you, mademoiselle.

520
01:28:18,361 --> 01:28:20,489
- Where are they?
- Not far.

521
01:28:20,697 --> 01:28:23,189
My soldiers took a shot
at them near the temples.

522
01:28:23,242 --> 01:28:24,949
But they got away.

523
01:28:26,349 --> 01:28:30,708
We had to tell him that we gave
his tiger to His Excellency.

524
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:33,231
He didn't take it very well.

525
01:28:34,004 --> 01:28:36,767
I don't suppose you'll
speak to him.

526
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:49,429
You see that old man over there
leaning on his cane.

527
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:52,410
That woman with her child?

528
01:28:53,192 --> 01:28:57,937
What if your tiger had torn of one
of their legs off or killed one of them?

529
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:02,611
Sangha never ate anyone.

530
01:29:02,661 --> 01:29:05,866
No, but he will.
It won't be long.

531
01:29:08,751 --> 01:29:12,889
If he had wanted to,
he would've already done it.

532
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:17,323
He never learned to hunt.

533
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:19,512
He's not afraid of people.

534
01:29:19,554 --> 01:29:22,224
When he gets hungry, he will go
for easiest prey he can find.

535
01:29:22,224 --> 01:29:25,883
Like the women in fields
or the children.

536
01:29:26,145 --> 01:29:28,433
You see, all great predators -

537
01:29:29,082 --> 01:29:32,809
who escape from captivity
become man-eaters -

538
01:29:32,809 --> 01:29:33,952
when they return to the wild.

539
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,683
They can't avoid it.
It's instinct.

540
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:40,704
But they are not like that.
I know they are not.

541
01:29:40,704 --> 01:29:44,861
No, you hope they are not.
That's only because you love Sangha.

542
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:49,207
And you don't love Kumar?

543
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,755
Of course I do.
More than you know.

544
01:29:58,306 --> 01:30:01,385
So don't kill them!
Please!

545
01:30:03,395 --> 01:30:06,230
I'm the one who took
Kumar from the jungle.

546
01:30:06,273 --> 01:30:09,151
I'm also the one who
let you keep Sangha.

547
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:11,481
So this whole
mess is my fault.

548
01:30:11,738 --> 01:30:15,154
If I don't do it
somebody else will.

549
01:30:15,408 --> 01:30:19,343
But I swear to you, after
this is all over.

550
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:23,741
I will never touch a rifle again. 
That's a promise.

551
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:28,626
I will leave the tigers and
the statues in peace.

552
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,002
I'll go back to my country.

553
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,799
I'll marry the woman I love.
And I'll stick to writing books.

554
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:36,265
Then go to write books now.

555
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:39,634
I can't.

556
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:43,019
Sangha isn't a killer.
Nor is Kumar.

557
01:30:43,168 --> 01:30:47,293
They'll stay in the jungle.
They'll learn to hunt.

558
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:50,416
But who will teach them?

559
01:37:24,304 --> 01:37:25,470
Your Excellency.

560
01:37:25,558 --> 01:37:29,596
I am sorry to learn that my
government has decided to abandon -

561
01:37:29,596 --> 01:37:31,540
the templeroad project,

562
01:37:31,852 --> 01:37:36,298
just when I can promise you that
the two animals responsible -

563
01:37:36,402 --> 01:37:40,741
for all the disturbance
are being killed.

564
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:47,474
Raoul?

565
01:37:49,038 --> 01:37:51,243
Raoul?
Where are you?

566
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:53,418
Raoul is gone.

567
01:37:54,252 --> 01:37:55,399
Raoul!

568
01:37:59,466 --> 01:38:00,609
Sangha!

569
01:38:07,183 --> 01:38:08,800
Where are you?

570
01:38:13,524 --> 01:38:15,244
Sangha, come out!

571
01:38:22,784 --> 01:38:23,992
Sangha!

572
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:32,862
Sangha?

573
01:38:38,447 --> 01:38:40,369
It's me, Raoul.

574
01:39:04,247 --> 01:39:06,280
I knew you'll recognize me.

575
01:39:13,632 --> 01:39:17,725
You must never come back
to the villages of men.

576
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:23,248
Promise me.

577
01:39:27,648 --> 01:39:29,743
You must stay in the jungle.

578
01:39:32,447 --> 01:39:33,633
Forever.

579
01:41:05,966 --> 01:41:07,130
Forgive me.

580
01:41:13,766 --> 01:41:14,927
Forgive me.

581
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:41,614
Did you hear that? Another
tiger is answering them.

582
01:41:42,465 --> 01:41:45,547
Now who out here would know
them, do you think?

583
01:41:48,346 --> 01:41:52,261
Whoever it is, could maybe
teach them to hunt?

584
01:41:52,309 --> 01:41:54,069
Let's hope so.

585
01:42:02,695 --> 01:42:04,799
We're taking a big
chance here.

586
01:42:07,659 --> 01:42:11,381
I know. But that's
good, isn't it?

587
01:42:12,123 --> 01:42:14,120
To take a change sometimes?

588
01:42:14,167 --> 01:42:15,924
Yeah. Sometimes it is good.

589
01:42:17,441 --> 01:42:20,305
Today it feels very good indeed.
