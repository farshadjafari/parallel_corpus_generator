1
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:13,636
What is she drawing?

2
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,518
What are you drawing, Celestine?

3
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:23,725
A bear.

4
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,772
And what's that?

5
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,482
This is a mouse.

6
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,398
And this is her friend.

7
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,448
That's all wrong.

8
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:33,534
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

9
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:34,952
- No!
- Yes!

10
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:37,952
A bear and a mouse
can't be together.

11
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,331
Alright, what story
shall I tell you tonight?

12
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,379
The Big Bad Bear?

13
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,044
Yes, the Big Bad Bear!

14
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:43,309
In the winter, the Big Bad Bear...

15
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,056
sleeps.

16
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,521
And when he awakens?

17
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:53,280
When he awakens, he is hungry.

18
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:55,779
Right. And what's he hungry for?

19
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,951
Just about anything.

20
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:00,245
Absolutely anything!

21
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,540
Tires, lamps, bicycles,
cars, houses...

22
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,919
When he's hungry he will
scarf down, um, sorry,

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,748
he will eat absolutely anything.

24
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,507
But among all these things,

25
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,510
what does the Big Bad
Bear like the most?

26
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,053
A little mouse.

27
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:18,131
A little mouse?

28
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,008
Just one little mouse?

29
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,342
Ten.

30
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:22,927
One hundred,

31
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:25,187
one thousand little mice.

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,731
Baked! Skewered!

33
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:28,899
SautÃ©ed!

34
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,315
Broth stewed! And even raw!

35
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:33,153
Raw?

36
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:35,447
Especially raw!

37
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,034
Alive and kicking with their
little coats and backpacks.

38
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,828
That's how he prefers them!

39
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,831
All raw! And all alive!

40
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:46,410
How can you be sure he is so bad?

41
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,089
Do you know the story about

42
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,677
the little mouse who did not
believe in the Big Bad Bear?

43
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:58,971
Everyone told her:

44
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,766
"Beware of the Big Bad Bear!"

45
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:05,053
But she thought she
was being clever,

46
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:08,689
that bloody... no,
that stinky little rat...

47
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,734
sorry, that nasty...

48
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:15,359
no, that cheeky little... brat!

49
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:18,783
She didn't believe
in the Big Bad Bear.

50
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:23,329
She would say "no, the Big Bad Bear

51
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,623
is just a story the Grey
One used to tell us

52
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:30,203
while endlessly sipping
her chamomile tea."

53
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:34,128
But she was wrong

54
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:37,969
because one fine day...

55
00:04:49,063 --> 00:04:52,142
Did you do this, Celestine?

56
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:00,404
Believe me, children,

57
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:06,414
only in fairy tales can
bears be friends with mice

58
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,161
and should you ever...

59
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,672
- What's she saying?
- I have no idea.

60
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:18,217
- What did you say?
- I said I don't know.

61
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,844
- Hush, I am listening.
- You actually grasp something?

62
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:21,637
Absolutely.

63
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,222
You never do.

64
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,682
- You mean I don't grasp anything?
- You think you do but you don't.

65
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:26,767
Say that again!

66
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:28,311
Even when we all do, you don't.

67
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,062
Silence!

68
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:39,939
Silence!

69
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,861
I'm hungry.

70
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:07,155
Nice little birdy. Come here,
my sweet little birdy!

71
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:14,821
Get back here,
you evil little beast!

72
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,254
The King of Candy

73
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:23,063
Is it safe, can we go?

74
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,265
Wait.

75
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,066
Let's go.

76
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:48,838
Look, Lucienne, look!

77
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,417
Leon has lost his first tooth.

78
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:54,090
Poor sweetheart.

79
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,967
And no trace of decay.

80
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,891
A shiny little pearl.

81
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:05,648
Don't cry, sweetie, it's alright.

82
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,358
I'll put it on the nightstand

83
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,402
and the little mouse will come.

84
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,031
The little mouse?
What little mouse?

85
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:17,117
The little tooth fairy mouse.

86
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:19,786
She comes by when you're asleep

87
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:23,036
and replaces your tooth
with a shiny coin.

88
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,957
What kind of coin?

89
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,839
A big coin. Your very
first business deal.

90
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,216
The base of your capital,

91
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:36,546
if, that is, you make
the proper investments.

92
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:41,766
But I've never heard of
that fairy mouse before.

93
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,641
Because you've never
lost a tooth before.

94
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:46,271
Gibberish!

95
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,941
If it's a fairy mouse,
then it can't be real.

96
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,361
Really? Then how do
the teeth disappear?

97
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:54,529
Well, um...

98
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:59,450
Go to sleep now. That way, the
mouse can come and replace

99
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,787
- your tooth with a shiny coin.
- How much?

100
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,074
Um, a quarter?

101
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,701
Two quarters.

102
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:10,420
That's my boy.

103
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,793
Time to sleep!

104
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,804
- A mouse!
- Yes!

105
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,348
A mouse? Where?

106
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,551
Behind the Teddy bears.

107
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:25,393
No way! Get out of here!

108
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:26,937
Get it, Daddy!

109
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,103
Out! We want no mice here.

110
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:34,691
George, do something!

111
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,527
Get it out of here!

112
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,283
- Where is it?
- It's there.

113
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:41,986
Out of there!

114
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,954
Get out, you nasty beast!

115
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:46,452
There it is. I see it.

116
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,957
My tooth. What about my coin?

117
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,800
Give me my coin!

118
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,005
Filthy creature.

119
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,616
Not so loud, George,
the kid is sleeping.

120
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,370
The garbage!

121
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,377
Ernest's my name and
singing's my game

122
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,589
But not for much longer
cuz I'm dying of honger

123
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:28,099
I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse

124
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:35,023
I haven't had a bite
for many a night

125
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:38,359
I've lost so much weight
I can't get a date

126
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,946
My pants are falling off my loins
Drop me a few coins

127
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:46,197
Toss some cash in my hat
Give my belly some fat

128
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,751
Ernest's my name and
singing's my game

129
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:58,877
No need to order A la Carte
Just drop some bread in my cart

130
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,634
Just one little baguette
As much as you can get

131
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,929
You would feel so much better

132
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,344
And so would I

133
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,187
Ernest's my name and
singing's my game

134
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,439
I'm feeling so light,
cuz I need a bite

135
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,733
That waffle's a masterpiece

136
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:21,236
So warm and ever so sweet

137
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,404
Mayday, mayday, it's getting away!

138
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:27,155
C'mon, please, make my day
By throwing me some money

139
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,944
Come!

140
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:37,043
Please be as charitable
Put a meal on my table

141
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:41,215
if you help me out
You won't think you're a lout

142
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,226
Beans, sausage, apple cake
I swear I'm not a fake

143
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:57,432
C'mon, please help me out
Before the cops kick me out

144
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,282
Got 5 days to pay.

145
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,876
I'm hungry!

146
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,160
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!

147
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,572
But I am hungry.

148
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,327
What's your name?

149
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:39,499
Ernest.

150
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,410
I am Celestine.

151
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,464
We need to talk. You cannot eat me.

152
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:47,924
Bears only eat mice in storybooks.

153
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,252
You're not a gullible bear cub.

154
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:51,427
But I'm hungry.

155
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:55,178
Do you think a little mouse
like me will fill you up?

156
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,850
Look at me, I'm all skin and bone.

157
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:00,812
Besides, eating out of
garbage bins is unhealthy.

158
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,774
They are full of diseases: the
flu, typhus, hepatitis, cholera...

159
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:07,478
Do you want to catch
a deadly disease?

160
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,776
- Well, no, Celestine, but...
- Let me see.

161
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,283
Snout, cold and wet.
Eyes, waxy. Fur, dull.

162
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:15,781
Let's see the ears.

163
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,538
How about the teeth?

164
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:20,039
Scary!

165
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:22,000
What? Am I ill?

166
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,203
No, but it won't be long now.

167
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:29,966
Listen, Ernest. I know a place

168
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:32,885
where you can eat only
what's good for you.

169
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:33,928
Like marshmallows?

170
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,140
Marshmallows, pinwheels,
nougats, chocolate,

171
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,560
almond paste, ok?

172
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:40,894
Ok!

173
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,561
Just here.

174
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,237
Help yourself, Ernest.

175
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:00,072
Wait.

176
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:06,628
There you go. Enjoy!

177
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,779
Thank you.

178
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:34,485
You're welcome.

179
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,632
Watch out!

180
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,419
Dental floss here!
It's dainty and it's dental!

181
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:49,773
C'mon, look alive!

182
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:03,279
My fondue's nice and hot,
Come and get a taste!

183
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,413
Don't let it go to waste!

184
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,665
Watch your step!

185
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,289
Sorry, M'am, I'm in a hurry.

186
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:39,319
It hasn't started yet.

187
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:43,156
They told us to wait here.

188
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,328
It smells like garbage here?

189
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:10,683
Let's hurry now! Or the
Big Bad Bear will come

190
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:12,063
and eat you raw.

191
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,358
Follow me now. Do you hear?

192
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,442
How many teeth did you collect?

193
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,902
Seven.

194
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,862
Is that all? I've got twelve.

195
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,064
Twelve!

196
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:25,744
I usually do better, that's
far from my best score.

197
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,913
How about you, Celestine?

198
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,573
How many do you have?

199
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,907
Me?

200
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,726
Stop! Stay where you are.

201
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,604
Now that's gonna hurt.

202
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,193
Here you go, twelve teeth.

203
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:07,410
Fine.

204
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:09,203
But I can do even better.

205
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,077
C'mon, next.

206
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,209
Only seven?

207
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,414
But six incisors. And
check out the quality.

208
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,884
I'll take one. This
one's too short.

209
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,723
Thank you.

210
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:40,068
Let's try this one.

211
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,532
Repeat after me "the Big Bad Bear

212
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:49,410
is walking above our heads."

213
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:53,036
"Fe Fig Fad Fear iv
walkik abow our headths."

214
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,708
Not quite there.

215
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:57,543
And now?

216
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:02,875
"Fe Fig Fad Fear is
walking above our heads."

217
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,419
Allow me.

218
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:12,676
Try now.

219
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,103
Stop!

220
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,689
Go on, now, "the Big Bad Bear...

221
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,110
"The Big Bad Bear is
walking above our heads."

222
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:24,654
There we go. It's all in the wrist.

223
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:26,315
The wrist.

224
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:29,902
What? All night long
and only one tooth?

225
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,199
I got stuck in a garbage bin.

226
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:34,830
Really? And how did you get out?

227
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:36,332
Actually, a bear...

228
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,785
A what?

229
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,461
No, nothing.

230
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:44,041
And would you mind telling
us what's in your bag?

231
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:51,305
So this is how you've been
spending your internship?

232
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:52,678
You're drawing,

233
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:55,310
instead of gathering teeth?

234
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,650
You're not going to become
a dentist that way.

235
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:04,985
I don't want to...

236
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:06,938
to become a dentist.

237
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,200
I see what it is.

238
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,655
You are behind by 50 teeth.
You've lost too many points.

239
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:18,709
Looks like you need
some motivation.

240
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,535
Come with me.

241
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,879
You see, Celestine,

242
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,674
we rodents, we are not bears.

243
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,920
Our strength is not our body mass

244
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,971
our muscles, our claws,

245
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:33,924
our terrifying jaws.

246
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,268
We are delicate creatures.

247
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,186
We are subtle, refined.

248
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:41,810
Our entire civilization,

249
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:44,685
our achievements
over the centuries,

250
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,112
what do we owe it all to?

251
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:48,647
To what?

252
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,649
To what do we owe it all?

253
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:53,325
Our what?

254
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:56,279
- Our incisors.
- Our incisors, exactly!

255
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:59,074
The building blocks of our society.

256
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:00,791
Thanks to them

257
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,619
we built the greatest cities.

258
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,834
Gnawed away at the hardest stone.

259
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,754
Built the most complex machines.

260
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,219
Rerouted the largest
rivers in the world.

261
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:16,057
And all this thanks to our cute,

262
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:17,975
our precious,

263
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,561
our delicate, our invaluable,

264
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:23,606
our perfect, our cutting incisors.

265
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:28,608
But what happens if a mouse should
lose one of their incisors?

266
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:31,736
They die.

267
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:34,450
They agonise in abominable pain.

268
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:35,993
They can no longer eat.

269
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,663
They die racked with hunger

270
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,207
and gnawed by the utmost solitude.

271
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,127
Let's take it from the top.

272
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:50,425
Which is the best replacement
tooth for a mouse?

273
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,212
- A bear's tooth.
- That's right.

274
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:55,971
They happen to have
the most solid teeth.

275
00:26:55,972 --> 00:27:00,723
And the easiest ones to find are
under the pillows of bear cubs.

276
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,229
So Celestine...

277
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,439
you're going back up there

278
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,901
and get some more teeth
from those little morons.

279
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:13,107
And I do not want to
see you back down here

280
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,408
until you have collected

281
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,452
fifty teeth.

282
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:21,198
Fifty teeth, Celestine!

283
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,628
Good luck, Celestine.

284
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:29,255
Are you coming, already?

285
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:31,333
I'm coming!

286
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:49,272
Hello, kids! Everyone
alright today?

287
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,236
I'd like a cream puff.

288
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,654
Coming right up.

289
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,573
I'd like a bag of candy.

290
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:56,907
Coming right up.

291
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,156
5 lollipops and some marshmallows.

292
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:02,705
Me too, marshmallows!

293
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,205
Some candy sticks.

294
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:09,667
One lemon ice cream, Dad.

295
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:12,123
Yes, one lemon ice cream!

296
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:16,295
Wait a minute!

297
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,473
Come this way.

298
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,396
No sweets, I've warned you already.

299
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:28,606
Never!

300
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,773
But Dad...

301
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:33,478
You are forbidden the
slightest piece of sugar.

302
00:28:33,737 --> 00:28:36,406
Do you want your teeth to fall off?

303
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:38,532
End up across the street,

304
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,407
at your mom's shop
with rotten teeth?

305
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,913
Go on, now.

306
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:46,866
We'll talk about it tonight.

307
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,470
Mister Ranconnet, hello!

308
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:00,422
How are we doing today?

309
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,424
Fine, fine.

310
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,019
I need a tooth so I
can eat my nougat.

311
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:09,101
What can I get you? An incisor?

312
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:12,980
- A canine?
- No, I need a pre-molar.

313
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,614
Let me see.

314
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,028
Here we are!

315
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,992
I have just the model you need.

316
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,912
A pre-molar. Premium quality.

317
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:26,330
Try it out!

318
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,286
It is perfect. I'll take it.

319
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,671
- Here you go, my sweetie.
- Thank you.

320
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,090
And what can I get for you, honey?

321
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,713
Some candy sticks?

322
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,510
Cotton candy?

323
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,679
Multi-coloured bonbons?

324
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,305
Just some marshmallows.

325
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:46,009
Marshmallows. Yes, of course!

326
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:47,511
I'm all out.

327
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:52,607
Don't cry! I've got some
in the storage room.

328
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,193
Don't move, I'll be right back.

329
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:03,861
What the devil are you
doing here? You thief!

330
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,503
He's breaking everything.

331
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:17,548
Get back here! I am
calling the police.

332
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,381
Ernest?

333
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,217
- My marshmallows!
- They're my marshmallows!

334
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,303
Police!

335
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:32,059
He's stolen all my sweets.

336
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,274
Over here! This is him, right here.

337
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:37,276
What's going on here?

338
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,279
Wait, is that Ernest?

339
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,033
This morning you were making
noise and now you're robbing?

340
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,243
How did you get in there?

341
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,367
Well, a little mouse that, um...

342
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:51,332
A little what?

343
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:54,494
I was hungry and it smelled good.

344
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:56,621
We're taking him in.

345
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,725
- Get in there!
- Give me back my marshmallows!

346
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,814
Let go of me, you thief!

347
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,558
My marshmallows.

348
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:20,145
There's no respect for the
honest working folks.

349
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:35,743
Want me to...

350
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,920
to set you free, Ernest?

351
00:31:38,922 --> 00:31:40,590
If I do,

352
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,418
would you do me a little favour?

353
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:57,148
A big favour. If I free
you, will you do it?

354
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:10,992
A huge favour, Ernest. If I
free you, will you do it?

355
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,373
The biggest favour in the world?

356
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:26,587
Yes! The biggest
favour in the world.

357
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:39,815
Some more green peas, sweetheart?

358
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:41,188
No, I want candy.

359
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:44,319
Come on, don't you
start this again.

360
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,865
We told you, you are not
allowed to eat candy.

361
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,908
But why?

362
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,952
Because of the laws of business.

363
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,954
Dad spoils teeth on one
side on the street

364
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:56,748
and mom replaces them
on the other side.

365
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:59,702
And one day both
shops will be yours.

366
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,379
Which means you'll be doubly rich.

367
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,629
As long as you smile to
the customers, of course.

368
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,260
And as my old man used to say

369
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:11,263
"a beautiful smile comes
from healthy teeth."

370
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:12,723
it's simple, Leon...

371
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:17,019
Wealth will come from your
fellow bears' rotten teeth.

372
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,346
Do you understand?

373
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:23,856
Yes.

374
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:29,858
I'm up early tomorrow
so let's all go to bed.

375
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:32,865
I must replace
everything Ernest ate.

376
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:36,956
None of that would ever
happen in my store.

377
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,702
Who would ever think
to steal teeth?

378
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,380
Over here, Ernest. Hurry up!

379
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,599
Here we are.

380
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,642
Fine.

381
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:01,769
Easy now! You're
making too much noise.

382
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:05,944
Stop it! You're going
to wake everybody up.

383
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,029
There we go.

384
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:11,490
Ernest! Wait!

385
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:13,159
Where are the teeth?

386
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:15,535
Probably stored in a safe.

387
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:16,828
That thing, over there?

388
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,956
Yes. I'll go and pick the lock.

389
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,540
Let me handle this.

390
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,789
Handle it? But how are you...

391
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,336
Ernest, no!

392
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,881
No, that's not how
you're supposed...

393
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,259
Ernest, stop that right now!

394
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,051
It's open.

395
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,302
Are you insane?

396
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,971
What, you wanted it open.

397
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,181
That is too heavy for me.

398
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:38,809
I'm so tired!

399
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,435
C'mon, you promised.

400
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:42,854
And then we're even, right?

401
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,181
We're even.

402
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:47,235
I'll check if the coast is clear.

403
00:34:50,947 --> 00:34:52,490
It is clear, you can...

404
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,405
Ernest, wait!

405
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,618
Bears go to bed early.

406
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:58,492
Especially in the wintertime.

407
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:21,427
I forbade you to show
up until you had...

408
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:36,325
This is unbelievable.
It's fabulous!

409
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:38,744
Look at this! How did you...

410
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,074
Bravo, Celestine!

411
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:45,292
I am so proud of you.

412
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,123
Hurray for Celestine!

413
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:57,065
The Big Bad Bear!

414
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,956
Celestine, do you
know this... this...

415
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:08,500
Did you bring him here?

416
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:12,001
The one who didn't believe
in the Big Bad Bear!

417
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,090
We all warned her
"beware of the Big..."

418
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,636
Run or he'll devour us all!

419
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,604
This way, Ernest!

420
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:37,859
Hurry!

421
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:41,321
C'mon, let's jump!

422
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,368
He's over there.

423
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:57,671
No Ernest, this way!

424
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,256
Pardon me! Sorry!

425
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:06,760
The exit is through
that tunnel over there.

426
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,028
He's over there.

427
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,071
Go left, Ernest!

428
00:38:34,503 --> 00:38:36,713
I don't understand.

429
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,667
I had everything locked up.
It's a disaster.

430
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:41,968
Look!

431
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:55,562
A disaster! I'm sure
it was locked up.

432
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,564
A mouse! In the van!

433
00:38:58,277 --> 00:38:59,444
Ernest?

434
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,777
Stop it right there!

435
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,789
Now how do we catch them?
You blew it!

436
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:33,395
Why did you stay down there?
You've gone insane?

437
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:35,063
I dozed off. Not my fault.

438
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:36,481
Not mine either.

439
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:38,233
It is! You brought me down.

440
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:40,110
I could not carry my bag.

441
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,279
You should've shown me the exit.

442
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,863
You said you'd find it.

443
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:45,907
Did I say that? Really?

444
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:50,162
Ernest, give yourself
up, you won't get away!

445
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,282
We've got him.

446
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:55,083
Now pull over!

447
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:57,036
Ok! If you insist.

448
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:01,298
We're not letting you go.

449
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,217
Watch out for the lamp-post.

450
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:09,806
Turn yourself in, we'll
never let you go.

451
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,805
So long, boys. Taking a right.

452
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:15,225
National Police United we fight

453
00:40:44,884 --> 00:40:46,051
This is it.

454
00:40:46,302 --> 00:40:48,300
So long, Celestine.

455
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,810
What do you mean?

456
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:57,513
Well, I'm home.

457
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,306
What about me?

458
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:02,067
You? I don't know.

459
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:05,522
I've made it to my home,
you go back to yours.

460
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,365
I no longer have a home.

461
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,575
They've banished me.
Even cursed me.

462
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:12,994
Celestine, now we're even.

463
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:15,580
You said it yourself.
You set me free

464
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:19,001
and I did you the biggest
favour in the world.

465
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:22,462
So now, we're even.

466
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:26,042
Even, even... But the situation
has changed, Ernest.

467
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:30,220
Mice are not allowed in a house.

468
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,237
Please, listen to me.

469
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:51,241
No mice in a house, ever.

470
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,535
You take one in, 1000
more will follow.

471
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,912
You all are like that.
Ask any bear.

472
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,114
Scram!

473
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:01,789
But, Ernest...

474
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:04,003
I said not a mouse in a house.

475
00:42:04,004 --> 00:42:05,205
Never!

476
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,044
You have to realize that
things have changed.

477
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:10,927
No mouse in a house!

478
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,425
- But...
- No buts!

479
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:14,556
- No way!
- Come on!

480
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:16,509
No mouse

481
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,477
in my house!

482
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:19,970
Scram!

483
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:52,173
Thank you.

484
00:42:56,765 --> 00:43:00,469
You can't get rid of
a mouse. Ask any bear.

485
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:02,601
Unless you kill it, of course.

486
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,182
Your chocolate's burning.

487
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:09,148
Want to kill me, Ernest?

488
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:11,779
Forget the broom, I'm too quick.

489
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,740
You can try the mouse trap.

490
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:17,827
Not easy either. We mice all
know that old trick by now.

491
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:21,080
There's also poison or glue traps.

492
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:22,790
Glue boards are cruel.

493
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:26,920
The poor little mouse gets
stuck as it steps on it.

494
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:29,506
It tries so hard to get off

495
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,382
that its heart blows up.

496
00:43:31,383 --> 00:43:34,211
You want my heart to
blow up, is that it?

497
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,766
Of course not, Celestine. But a
bear and a mouse, it's just not...

498
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:41,059
Not what? Not seemly? Not proper?

499
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,763
Bears up above and mice down below?

500
00:43:44,146 --> 00:43:46,940
Well, yes... it's
always been like this.

501
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,272
Alright. Do you have a cellar?

502
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:50,986
Well, yeah, I...

503
00:43:51,487 --> 00:43:52,939
So, I'll go down

504
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:54,902
and you stay up here.

505
00:43:56,075 --> 00:43:57,492
No buts. So long!

506
00:43:57,493 --> 00:43:59,536
And you better stay upstairs.

507
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:09,630
No, you stay downstairs! I don't
want to see you or hear you.

508
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:12,545
My chocolate!

509
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:55,431
There she is!

510
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:57,273
There she is!

511
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,651
The one who did not believe
in the Big Bad Bear.

512
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:02,695
Everyone said to her

513
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:06,446
"beware of the Big Bad Bear!"

514
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:13,365
it's just a nightmare.

515
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,915
There's nothing to be afraid of.

516
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:21,464
I'm not your nightmare.

517
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,292
It's me, Ernest.

518
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,177
Ernest, I am damned.

519
00:48:29,598 --> 00:48:32,642
Damned? What nonsense is this?

520
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,767
But I am! I'm all
alone in this world.

521
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:38,857
Nobody loves me and I have no home.

522
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:42,189
And what about me? Am I loved?

523
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:44,233
Did you make this?

524
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:50,159
It is fabulous!

525
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,782
Exactly what I look like.

526
00:48:51,912 --> 00:48:56,868
If you can do this you can't be
alone. You're a great artist.

527
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,877
But that's just why I am so alone.

528
00:48:59,878 --> 00:49:01,379
They hate my drawings.

529
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,582
They want me to be a dentist.

530
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,219
I hear you. I wanted
to be on stage,

531
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,429
become a musician, tell stories.

532
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,057
But they wanted me
to become a judge.

533
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:16,808
Like my father, my
grandfather, my great uncle...

534
00:49:17,062 --> 00:49:20,892
"Go play your music and tell
your stories elsewhere!"

535
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:24,144
"You'd be better off
studying your law books."

536
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:25,812
Look.

537
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,732
"No, Celestine!

538
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,192
"You are staying downstairs!"

539
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,869
"I don't want to hear or see you!"

540
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:37,370
Isn't this a nice portrait?

541
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:42,336
Take your drawing equipment

542
00:49:42,337 --> 00:49:43,504
and follow me.

543
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:49,260
We're going to make you a studio.

544
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:51,680
A real fine arts studio.

545
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,846
This will be my first
real painting.

546
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:56,810
What will you paint?

547
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,600
The Big Bad Bear. What else?

548
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:03,312
There.

549
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:05,690
Look ferocious!

550
00:50:05,944 --> 00:50:07,020
There you go.

551
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:13,576
Lift your leg.

552
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:15,241
Perfect.

553
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:17,538
Stay still.

554
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,991
Keep looking ferocious.

555
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,844
- Can I see?
- I told you not to move!

556
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:45,191
Are you ill?

557
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,818
It's just a cold.

558
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,646
Into bed, right away!

559
00:50:50,405 --> 00:50:54,109
When you have fever, you
must drink lots of liquids.

560
00:52:17,242 --> 00:52:19,785
Leave me alone!
I don't want to. Help!

561
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:21,784
Ernest, calm down.

562
00:52:23,623 --> 00:52:25,621
I am not your nightmare.

563
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,252
I am Celestine.

564
00:52:28,003 --> 00:52:29,921
Any marshmallows left?

565
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:31,130
Of course.

566
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:32,833
Don't eat them all, ok?

567
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:34,592
Of course not.

568
00:52:34,593 --> 00:52:36,010
Promise?

569
00:52:36,011 --> 00:52:37,508
Cross my heart.

570
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:12,793
Good night, Ernest.

571
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:39,116
Guess what? I'm cured.

572
00:53:44,496 --> 00:53:45,913
Check it out.

573
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,505
Bet you can't do it with 4.

574
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,885
Do you really?

575
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:10,889
Let's do it again!

576
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:12,474
Come on!

577
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:28,080
After the Court's decision,
there is a warrant out

578
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:30,541
for the arrest of the burglars...

579
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:32,251
Are we the burglars?

580
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:36,547
And their arrest is imminent.
A matter of days.

581
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:39,001
They've already forgotten about us.

582
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,852
We will take no rest until we've
found Ernest and Celestine.

583
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:55,191
We'll chase them out
of their hideaway.

584
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:58,110
However long it takes,
months if necessary

585
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,654
but we will find them
sooner or later.

586
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:03,407
Their crimes cannot go unpunished.

587
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:06,785
They will be captured
and brought to justice.

588
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:09,288
Ernest will be judged in due form.

589
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:11,415
Celestine will be punished.

590
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:14,418
The Court is already
aware of the case.

591
00:55:14,419 --> 00:55:18,088
As for Celestine, the
punishment will fit the crime.

592
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:20,841
Ernest will be tried with severity.

593
00:55:20,842 --> 00:55:25,388
The sentence shall be irrevocable
for Ernest and Celestine.

594
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,349
Did you call me?

595
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,928
No, Celestine. Everything's fine.

596
00:55:32,771 --> 00:55:34,223
Everything's fine.

597
00:55:38,526 --> 00:55:40,728
You've made so much progress.

598
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:44,862
I'm sick and tired of
drawing the Big Bad Bear.

599
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,197
Really?

600
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:50,322
Do you know of a more
interesting subject?

601
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,085
I'd like to paint a
winter landscape.

602
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,170
You'll have to wait for spring.

603
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:02,171
We bears know all about
that, waiting for spring.

604
00:56:02,384 --> 00:56:04,086
The snow will be gone.

605
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:06,838
Oh, you want to paint snow.

606
00:56:07,472 --> 00:56:10,551
Celestine wants to paint the snow.

607
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:23,397
Now, the artist gets to work!

608
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,072
Thank you, Ernest.

609
00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:45,131
May I introduce to you...
the Winter!

610
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:50,257
With music, it would sound
something like this.

611
00:58:02,629 --> 00:58:04,581
And one and two...

612
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,772
Ernest, the van!

613
00:58:28,988 --> 00:58:30,440
What, the van?

614
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,117
It's like a big red spot.

615
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:35,236
They could find us because of it.

616
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:39,578
There's only one solution.

617
00:59:02,313 --> 00:59:04,186
Come see these creatures!

618
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,893
I've seen them already.

619
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:09,691
Do you want to see them close up?

620
00:59:09,988 --> 00:59:11,781
I can see them just fine.

621
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:34,929
Come on, let's go!

622
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:25,180
The search... active...
we will not rest...

623
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,983
until the burglars, Ernest and
Celestine have been arrested.

624
01:00:29,984 --> 01:00:31,527
Suit yourselves!

625
01:00:32,153 --> 01:00:35,739
This is a call to witness.
Any person who might...

626
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,533
Don't worry, Celestine.

627
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:39,284
They'll never find us.

628
01:00:39,285 --> 01:00:43,410
The police are still looking
for the two criminals...

629
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:46,247
and will not rest
until they are found.

630
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:17,107
- What was that?
- The little fairy mouse?

631
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:21,444
George, go see what's happened.

632
01:01:23,454 --> 01:01:24,826
My van!

633
01:01:25,456 --> 01:01:26,532
My shop!

634
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,039
What the...?

635
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,829
Is this paint?

636
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:38,127
Ernest!

637
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,929
Lucienne! Call the police!

638
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,132
I know where Ernest is.

639
01:02:34,776 --> 01:02:36,978
Nice and sunny morning.

640
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,947
Mr. Big Bad Bear is
terribly grumpy.

641
01:02:40,948 --> 01:02:44,326
Mr. Big Bad Bear doesn't
want to wake up.

642
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:47,621
Is the Big Bad Bear
going to devour me?

643
01:02:47,622 --> 01:02:49,873
Good idea. Then I could sleep.

644
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:54,079
In that case, we shall give
him a hearty breakfast

645
01:02:55,213 --> 01:02:58,462
so that I can live
to see another day.

646
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:04,130
That is yummy.

647
01:03:04,222 --> 01:03:06,306
How can you sleep in

648
01:03:06,307 --> 01:03:08,009
on such a sunny day?

649
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,022
Ernest, come look!

650
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:25,534
We have to hide you in the cellar.

651
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,203
We've got to hide
you too, Celestine.

652
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,951
Relax, I have a plan.

653
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:31,498
A plan?

654
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:35,711
Are you sure about this?

655
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:37,505
Don't worry, Ernest.

656
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:58,063
In here! He's here!

657
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,291
Where is Ernest?

658
01:04:17,545 --> 01:04:20,881
Uncle Ernest? He's gone to
town to fetch some honey.

659
01:04:20,882 --> 01:04:23,801
He said he'd be back tomorrow.

660
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,810
For the last time, Celestine...

661
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,762
Where is Ernest?

662
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:38,558
Very well.

663
01:04:38,733 --> 01:04:40,731
You know what to expect.

664
01:05:05,259 --> 01:05:07,302
For the last time, Ernest...

665
01:05:07,345 --> 01:05:09,218
Where is Celestine?

666
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,513
Alright. You know what to expect.

667
01:05:13,601 --> 01:05:15,849
Heave Ho!

668
01:05:24,111 --> 01:05:25,563
Now let go!

669
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,500
Read all about horrible
Ernest's trial.

670
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,168
Buy Mouse Weekly!

671
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,213
Read all about the bear
and mouse scandal.

672
01:05:43,214 --> 01:05:45,883
Over there! It's him, look!

673
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,625
The trial will now begin.

674
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,258
The accused may enter.

675
01:06:36,434 --> 01:06:38,011
Is that Celestine?

676
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,526
Accused, please stand

677
01:06:46,527 --> 01:06:48,070
and state your name.

678
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,574
Can you tell us where Ernest
the bear can be found?

679
01:06:59,165 --> 01:07:02,414
You refuse to tell us where
Celestine can be found?

680
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,963
In that case you will
be charged twice.

681
01:07:06,964 --> 01:07:08,632
The first for your crimes.

682
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:11,177
The second for her crimes.

683
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:14,554
What has she done wrong?
Nothing at all!

684
01:07:14,555 --> 01:07:16,306
Nothing at all?

685
01:07:16,307 --> 01:07:20,603
Bringing a ferocious bear into our
midst, you call that nothing?

686
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:24,689
He was dying of hunger. You
want the poor to die of hunger?

687
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,858
As fat as all of you are!

688
01:07:26,859 --> 01:07:29,569
I had to carry her
heavy bag for her.

689
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,528
Silence!

690
01:07:30,529 --> 01:07:32,823
She doesn't want to be a dentist.

691
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,532
Silence!

692
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:37,577
You and your accomplice Celestine

693
01:07:37,578 --> 01:07:40,205
are accused of a number
of heinous crimes.

694
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:44,542
Breaking and entering, possession
of stolen goods, auto theft.

695
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:48,004
Escaping, shipwrecking,
bodily injury.

696
01:07:48,005 --> 01:07:49,965
There are countless witnesses.

697
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:52,425
Witnesses are countless!

698
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:55,175
But most of all Ernest,

699
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:58,470
you are accused of a
most hideous crime...

700
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:01,935
you frighten children.

701
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:04,389
Me? Children, do I frighten you?

702
01:08:08,609 --> 01:08:10,902
Me? I frighten mothers?

703
01:08:10,903 --> 01:08:12,730
Madame, do I frighten you?

704
01:08:13,072 --> 01:08:14,398
No, um...

705
01:08:17,785 --> 01:08:19,783
A mouse! Over there!

706
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:26,995
And now, we will hear
from the defense.

707
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:31,840
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, Your Honour,

708
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:35,511
what is my client being accused of?
Of being a bear?

709
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,552
I am here to defend my client...

710
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,100
- What did he say?
- No idea.

711
01:08:42,101 --> 01:08:44,185
- What did you say?
- I said I have no idea.

712
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:45,478
Hush, we're listening.

713
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:48,189
- Do you grasp something?
- Absolutely.

714
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,767
Liar, you don't.

715
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,365
Order in the court!

716
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,863
Stop this at once!

717
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:03,788
Celestine, in the light
of the accusations...

718
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:04,914
Nonsense!

719
01:09:04,915 --> 01:09:08,460
You are accusing me
of living with a bear.

720
01:09:08,461 --> 01:09:09,753
How dare you?

721
01:09:09,754 --> 01:09:12,464
All of you are prejudiced!

722
01:09:12,465 --> 01:09:14,299
Yes, Celestine is my friend.

723
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,302
This is what you are
holding against me.

724
01:09:17,303 --> 01:09:19,763
"The mice below,
the bears above"...

725
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:21,806
Is that your idea of raising kids?

726
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:25,268
In the fear of mice?
Want them to be idiots?

727
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:26,561
Silence, Celestine!

728
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,605
You're the accused, not the lawyer.

729
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:31,275
Order or I'll clear the room!

730
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:36,859
Clear the room!

731
01:09:40,367 --> 01:09:42,577
The trial is not over.

732
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,075
Come back!

733
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:47,204
Celestine, listen to me!

734
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:50,457
Nobody questions the
foundations of our society.

735
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:52,333
Least of all a mouse!

736
01:09:52,379 --> 01:09:54,631
Please listen, Your Honour!

737
01:09:54,632 --> 01:09:55,924
Silence!

738
01:09:59,553 --> 01:10:01,255
Sit back down!

739
01:10:02,681 --> 01:10:04,641
Wait, we must help him.

740
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:06,640
He'll make it by himself.

741
01:10:07,228 --> 01:10:08,725
Get your paws off me!

742
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,314
Back to your box!

743
01:10:11,315 --> 01:10:12,687
That's an order!

744
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:16,858
But you're on fire.

745
01:10:16,862 --> 01:10:18,063
That's enough!

746
01:10:18,072 --> 01:10:19,569
Take your seat!

747
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,325
I will not repeat myself.

748
01:10:27,873 --> 01:10:29,416
Get down from there.

749
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:31,084
Get back down, I say.

750
01:10:31,085 --> 01:10:33,629
I will not tolerate this attitude.

751
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,835
Let go of me!

752
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,797
Let go of me this instant!

753
01:10:46,183 --> 01:10:47,475
Your Honour!

754
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:50,392
Come quickly!

755
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:51,976
We have to get out.

756
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:54,521
What are you doing? Let me go!

757
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:03,366
Where is everybody?

758
01:11:03,367 --> 01:11:05,865
They ran for their lives.
Come, now.

759
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:07,954
They all abandoned me.

760
01:11:08,414 --> 01:11:09,957
But you did not.

761
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,414
Come on now, let's go.

762
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,756
Tell me, if we get
out of here alive...

763
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:21,460
what would really make you happy?

764
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,839
Finding Ernest and
living with him forever.

765
01:11:25,389 --> 01:11:26,590
Alright.

766
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:30,974
But still, wanting to live with
a bear, what a weird idea!

767
01:11:31,228 --> 01:11:34,105
Why, you live with
a bear, don't you?

768
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:35,649
Oh yes, I do.

769
01:11:35,983 --> 01:11:38,652
Precisely, that's a weird idea.

770
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:48,908
Are you ok, Your Honor?

771
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,866
What happened?

772
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:54,539
You caught fire, Sir.

773
01:12:08,265 --> 01:12:10,225
You saved my life.

774
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:12,060
How can I ever thank you?

775
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,639
- That's no big deal.
- It is a big deal!

776
01:12:14,647 --> 01:12:16,773
What would really make you happy?

777
01:12:16,774 --> 01:12:18,897
- Right now?
- Of course.

778
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,572
Finding Celestine and
living with her forever.

779
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,943
You are a free bear.

780
01:12:42,508 --> 01:12:44,176
She saved my life.

781
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:47,363
No, Ernest.

782
01:13:47,364 --> 01:13:48,907
- Yes.
- No.

783
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:49,987
Yes.

784
01:13:50,284 --> 01:13:52,361
No, it is not possible.

785
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,995
Yes it is.

786
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,123
We cannot tell our story.

787
01:13:57,124 --> 01:13:58,541
It is too sad.

788
01:13:58,792 --> 01:14:01,961
We met in a garbage bin
and you wanted to eat me.

789
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:04,460
- I was just joking.
- It just wasn't funny.

790
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:06,841
The world must not know.

791
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,341
We'll just embellish.

792
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:13,222
Imagine you were a tiny thing,
abandoned and lying in that bin...

793
01:14:13,223 --> 01:14:16,100
A baby. Your eyes were
not even open yet.

794
01:14:16,101 --> 01:14:17,223
Now draw it.

795
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,064
I was a street sweeper,

796
01:14:21,065 --> 01:14:23,609
sweeping up dead leaves. You see?

797
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:28,321
And that's when I
heard a faint noise.

798
01:14:28,322 --> 01:14:29,489
Was it me?

799
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:30,948
It was you.

800
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:32,825
And then what did you do?

801
01:14:32,826 --> 01:14:35,578
Well, I took you out of the bin

802
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:37,830
then I put you in my pocket.

803
01:14:37,831 --> 01:14:39,999
And then I took you home.

804
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,958
And then?

805
01:14:40,959 --> 01:14:43,582
Then I took care of you.

806
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,088
You seemed happy

807
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:46,839
so I decided to keep you.

808
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,134
You found your place and we
ended up living together.

809
01:14:50,135 --> 01:14:53,305
That's how we met.

810
01:14:54,264 --> 01:14:57,600
After this one, can we
tell other stories?

811
01:14:57,601 --> 01:15:00,645
Plenty of other stories, Celestine.
