1
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:03,258
What's your pleasure, Mr. Cotton?

2
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,053
The box.

3
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,900
Take it, it's yours.

4
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,284
It always was.

5
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,632
It's gotta be one of these.

6
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,630
- I'm going to freeze to death.
- Okay, okay.

7
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:01,638
Well, maybe somebody changed
the lock.

8
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:04,218
Well, that's crazy.
Who's gonna change this lock?

9
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,346
Well, I don't know.
It was just a suggestion.

10
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:09,389
Ah! Success.

11
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:11,350
Voila!

12
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,770
Well, this is it.

13
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:17,898
The old homestead.

14
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:29,035
- Oh! It smells damp.
- Well, it's... uh...

15
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,496
been empty for a while,
hasn't it?

16
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:35,166
But we'll soon warm it up.

17
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,210
and get it feeling like a home.

18
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,422
- How long since you were here?
- Oh, the better part of ten years.

19
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,425
I wanted to sell it after
the old lady died,

20
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:47,102
but I couldn't get Frank to agree.

21
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:49,097
I guess he needed a hideout
or something.

22
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,353
Would you look at this?

23
00:06:56,856 --> 00:07:00,276
And don't worry,
this stuff means nothing to me.

24
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:02,653
It all goes.

25
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,787
I thought half of it was
your brother's.

26
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,283
I've never known him to kick cash
out of bed. Besides...

27
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,620
he's probably behind bars
some place.

28
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:12,538
You know...

29
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:18,420
we'll have to let Kirsty see this place
before we do a thing to it.

30
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,838
She'll love it.

31
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,048
You really want to move in here?

32
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,592
You don't like it?

33
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,344
I suppose it's better than Brooklyn.

34
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:28,597
Oh, don't start, Julia.

35
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,475
- Don't start what?
- Look...

36
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,810
we can make it work here.

37
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:37,647
Now I've got a terrific job,
you're back in your own turf.

38
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:41,443
We can be happy.

39
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,237
- All right, all right.
- So what's the argument?

40
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,408
- No argument.
- Oh, Christ!

41
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:48,826
But honey...

42
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,373
Shit!

43
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,206
Larry!

44
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,457
Larry!

45
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:36,959
Where are you?

46
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:37,794
In here.

47
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:47,846
Squatters?

48
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:54,395
Frank.

49
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:57,898
- He's here?
- Well, he's been here.

50
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:00,109
I mean, there's stuff in the kitchen
you wouldn't believe.

51
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:03,612
He's obviously made
one of his famous getaways.

52
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:06,365
What the hell is that?

53
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,508
Who is this?

54
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:25,780
Dad?

55
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,635
Kirsty!

56
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:28,394
I got through.

57
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:29,430
Darling, where are you?

58
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,433
- I found a room.
- You what?

59
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,900
I said, I found a room.

60
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,313
Wait, I thought you were going
to stay with us for awhile..

61
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:36,903
Dad...

62
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,566
Well, you'd like this house.

63
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:40,693
You'd like my room.

64
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,504
I'd really like you to see this house.
It's something else.

65
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:03,049
Maybe in the next couple of days.
I gotta find myself a job.

66
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,759
What for, sweetie?

67
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:08,095
Look, you've already made
the gesture, there's no need...

68
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,848
Dad, this isn't a gesture. This is
something I need to do.

69
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,101
Come on and trust me a little,
okay?

70
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:31,830
Call me tomorrow.

71
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,916
I will. I'll see you.

72
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:36,793
Bye, Dad.

73
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,817
So?

74
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,195
Why not.

75
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:06,656
Great.

76
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,242
We'll move in on Sunday.

77
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:13,706
Listen look out for the molding
on the way through here.

78
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:16,633
- All right.
- All right.

79
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:19,427
- Are you all right back there?
- Yeah, yeah.

80
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:22,966
All right, okay. Now just take it
straight upstairs.

81
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,429
Don't worry, it'll get through.

82
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,015
- All right.
- Hey, you got my arm!

83
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,682
All right, all right.

84
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,727
Watch it.

85
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:37,105
Let's take five, guys.

86
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,568
How's things in there?

87
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,862
Looks like a bomb dropped.

88
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:45,030
You got any beer?

89
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:47,365
There's some in the fridge.

90
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:50,952
Oh, well...

91
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:52,996
why don't I get it?

92
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:57,250
I got nothing better to do.

93
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:06,740
Excuse me.

94
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:09,451
- My lucky day.
- Hi.

95
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,746
- You wanna buy a bed?
- Not much.

96
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:14,463
Dad?

97
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:16,006
- Kirsty!
- Hi.

98
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,835
Hello, sweetie. Come here.

99
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:20,629
- Here you go.
- Oh, great.

100
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,235
This is a big house.

101
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,591
- You like?
- Yeah.

102
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:26,308
Me like.

103
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:29,680
I'll give you the grand tour if we ever
get this goddamn bed moved.

104
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,433
- Julia here?
- She's upstairs.

105
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:34,560
Look, be gentle with her, okay?-

106
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,396
- She hates moving.
- Surprise.

107
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:40,775
- Kirsty!
- Okay, all right, I'll be nice.

108
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:43,076
Get on with grand work and

109
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:45,739
I'll make myself some coffee.
- That's a great idea.

110
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:47,157
- There's the kitchen.
- Okay.

111
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:48,783
Bye.

112
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,288
Is that your daughter?

113
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:56,542
- She's got her mother's looks.
- Her mother's dead.

114
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,977
Oh, shit!

115
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,523
Can I come in?

116
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:22,151
Can I come in?

117
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:31,829
- You're Julia, right?
- That's right.

118
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,206
Who are you?

119
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,292
I'm Frank.

120
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,796
I'm brother Frank.

121
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,215
Oh, yes!

122
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,802
I... I came for the wedding.

123
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,641
Well, can I come in or not?

124
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,019
I'm sorry. Of course.

125
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,485
- You're very welcome.
- Yeah. Well, that's nice to know.

126
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,615
Do you have a towel?

127
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,450
Have you got a towel?

128
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:11,911
Kirsty.

129
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,415
There's one in the bathroom.

130
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,628
Oh, by the way, did Daddy tell you
I got a room?

131
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,589
It's not that big, but it's okay.

132
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:23,632
Julia?

133
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,012
Julia?

134
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:18,814
What shall we drink to?

135
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,195
Wedded bliss?

136
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:26,822
I'm very happy.

137
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:28,491
I'm sure you are.

138
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:32,703
Are you going to let me kiss
the bride?

139
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,973
What about Larry?

140
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,065
Forget him.

141
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,924
Take the weight away from me,
my foot's got.

142
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,675
- You got it?
- Got it.

143
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:08,220
Now push it to me as I pull.

144
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:36,792
It's never enough.

145
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:41,380
Julia.

146
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:49,680
Please!

147
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,186
I'll do anything you want.

148
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:01,608
Anything.

149
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:13,621
Here.

150
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,669
- Oh, is it deep?
- I don't know. I haven't looked.

151
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:21,303
You know me and blood.

152
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,632
- I'm going to faint.
- You're not going to faint.

153
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:25,217
Oh, shit!

154
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:28,846
- Look, let me see it.
- Shit!

155
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,974
Oh, it's going to need stitches.

156
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:35,060
- Oh, God, I'm going to throw up.
- You're not going to throw up.

157
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:37,688
- Just take it easy, take it easy.
- I'm going to throw up.

158
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:38,772
It's going to be all right.

159
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:41,525
Let's go downstairs.?

160
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,154
- Okay?
- So stupid!

161
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:05,593
What happened?

162
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:07,887
It was just an accident.
He's all right.

163
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,473
Look, will you drive?
He needs stitches.

164
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,517
- Yeah, sure.
- The keys are in the kitchen.

165
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,521
- So stupid.
- It's all right.

166
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:47,094
No, no, I am not kidding.

167
00:22:47,386 --> 00:22:48,727
This doctor is pocking around

168
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:51,306
with all the delicacy and compassion
of Joseph Mengele,

169
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:53,851
and I'm warning him: "Listen,
I'm going to pass out!"

170
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,061
He says,
"No, of course you're not, old boy".

171
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:58,445
The next thing I know,
I'm on the floor,

172
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,066
and he's standing there
like he's the one that needs help.

173
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:03,440
- He's probably afraid you'd sue him.
- I should do it!

174
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,779
Bill, I should do it, you know
all about that stuff.

175
00:23:05,814 --> 00:23:07,823
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll sue his ass.

176
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:15,665
Doctors!

177
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,549
That's right, honey.

178
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,377
And what's my darling daughter
drinking?

179
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,421
I don't remember.

180
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,631
Oh, Julia,
you want some more wine?

181
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:25,675
Uh, no more for me, thanks.?

182
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,135
Okay.

183
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:30,221
- Stop. I won't be able to stand up.
- So lie down.

184
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:41,817
Would you all excuse me.
I think I'm going to go to bed.

185
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,360
Are your all right, darling?

186
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,490
- We ought to be making a move, too.
- But, Bill!

187
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:50,457
Absolu... absolutely not!

188
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:52,536
This is the night
of the paper hats here.

189
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:55,706
We're celebrating... something.
So sit down.

190
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:58,250
Good night..

191
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,127
You'll have to come to us next.

192
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:01,260
Yeah, real soon.

193
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:03,423
- I'm glad you're back.
- Thank you.

194
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:05,217
- Good night.
- Good night.

195
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:24,528
- Does it still hurt?
- What?

196
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:29,033
Ho. No, only when I drink.

197
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:46,405
Oh, God!

198
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:51,202
No, please!

199
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:52,453
Out!

200
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:00,836
Julia!

201
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,593
Oh my God!

202
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:09,845
Don't look at me.

203
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:17,646
Who... who... who are you?

204
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:21,608
I said, don't look.

205
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:24,778
Help me!

206
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:32,286
Tell me who you are.

207
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:36,040
Frank.

208
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:41,629
No.

209
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:43,965
No!

210
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:46,342
Believe me, it's me.

211
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:48,386
It's really me.

212
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:53,808
His blood, on the floor.
It brought me back.

213
00:26:56,811 --> 00:26:57,812
Back?

214
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:02,024
From where?

215
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,152
Just help me, will you?

216
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:08,407
Please, God, help me!

217
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:36,519
- Somebody...
- Wait!

218
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,829
You can't leave me like this,
you can't.

219
00:27:58,082 --> 00:27:59,876
What do you want me to do?

220
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,923
The blood brought me this far.

221
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,633
I need more.

222
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,971
You have to heal me.

223
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:23,902
Hi.

224
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:26,446
Are you all right?

225
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,994
Kirsty? I thought I'd lost you.

226
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:34,579
No, I'm here.

227
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:37,624
Good night.

228
00:28:59,648 --> 00:29:02,276
Why don't you stay at Larry's
house? There's plenty of room.

229
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:05,279
Oh, yeah, there's room.
And there's Julia.

230
00:29:06,238 --> 00:29:07,155
Ah! I see.

231
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:21,795
- She's like you, she's so damn polite.
- Oh, yeah? Meaning what?

232
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,090
Oh, I don't know, she's uptight
and frigid.

233
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,431
I beg your pardon.

234
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,927
See, there you go.
"I beg your pardon."

235
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,179
Hey, we're not al frigid.

236
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:32,639
- Oh, no?
- Oh, no.

237
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:34,266
Oh, no?

238
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:36,518
Oh, no.

239
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,145
It's not what I heard..

240
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:40,690
You must have been speaking
to all the wrong people.

241
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:22,483
Anything?

242
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:24,944
Anything.

243
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:50,888
You'll do it?

244
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,143
Yes, I will..

245
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,054
Kirsty? Kirsty?

246
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,388
Kirsty!

247
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,893
- You all right?
- Yeah.

248
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:17,811
I don't know...

249
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,190
I was dreaming.

250
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:25,445
Daddy!

251
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,209
Hello.

252
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:51,472
I'm all right, honey.

253
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:53,683
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

254
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,935
Never better.

255
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:58,563
- Now you sleep well, okay?
- Yeah.

256
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:03,025
- I love you, sweetie
- I love you too, Daddy.

257
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:04,318
Bye.

258
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:13,035
- Who was it?
- She had a bad dream.

259
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,162
- Who?
- Kirsty.

260
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,215
Kirsty.

261
00:33:52,994 --> 00:33:55,371
- Not much fun, is it?
- What?

262
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:57,498
Drinking alone.

263
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:02,587
Not much.

264
00:34:05,506 --> 00:34:07,217
I thought maybe...

265
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,594
well...

266
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:13,265
as we're both on our own, maybe
we could have a drink together.

267
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:21,982
Why not.

268
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:29,491
You know, it's not often that...

269
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,202
you know.

270
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:36,831
- There's a first time for everything.
- That's right, yeah.

271
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,417
I suppose that's right.

272
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:47,509
- Would you... like a drink?
- Oh, no, no, no.

273
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:50,637
I'm well over my limit.?

274
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,391
You know, it's funny,

275
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:56,643
but... I...

276
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,815
I feel like I've known you
for years, you know.

277
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:09,615
What's the matter?

278
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,540
It's what you brought me here for,
isn't it?

279
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:20,002
Well, isn't it?

280
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:22,421
I suppose so, yes.

281
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,631
So, what's your problem?

282
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:27,009
Let's get on with it.

283
00:35:30,804 --> 00:35:32,931
You're not going to change
your fucking mind, are you?

284
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,184
I'm sorry.

285
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:40,480
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay, okay, sorry, okay? Okay.

286
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:50,407
Right.

287
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:03,964
This isn't the bedroom..

288
00:36:05,841 --> 00:36:06,675
No.

289
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,765
So, what's going on?

290
00:36:15,476 --> 00:36:17,269
We don't need a bed, do we?

291
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:21,815
Well, no, I suppose not.

292
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:27,404
I've always preferred the floor.

293
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:31,617
Oh, first time for everything, eh?

294
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,497
Why don't you take
your jacket off?

295
00:36:37,414 --> 00:36:38,249
Yeah,

296
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:40,626
why don't I?

297
00:37:01,983 --> 00:37:03,859
Why don't you do the same thing?

298
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:06,112
Maybe I will.

299
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,294
You're very beautiful.

300
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:23,671
Am I?

301
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,424
Oh, you know you are.

302
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:30,511
The loveliest woman I've ever seen.

303
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:35,016
- Oh, Christ!
- What's wrong?

304
00:37:38,644 --> 00:37:39,897
One minute.

305
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:41,733
Too much drink.

306
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:43,985
Have to empty the old bladder.

307
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:50,909
Did you lock this?

308
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:57,415
Please! Please!

309
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:22,607
Don't look at me.

310
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:31,221
Jesus Christ!

311
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:55,329
See?.

312
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:58,373
It's making me whole again.

313
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,631
Every drop of blood you spill
puts more flesh on my bones.

314
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:07,342
And we both want that,
don't we?

315
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:12,430
Good.!

316
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:15,016
Come here.

317
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:18,353
Come here, damn you,
I want to touch you.

318
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:23,150
Come to daddy.

319
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:38,374
Julia!

320
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:02,899
Julia!

321
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,614
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

322
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:32,972
Julia, I was calling for you.
Didn't you hear?

323
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:35,808
Are you in there?

324
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:39,228
Do you want a cookie, little girl?

325
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:43,025
I'm feeling sick.

326
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:46,069
Oh, babe.
Is there anything I can get you?

327
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,323
Maybe a brandy.

328
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,221
It's coming right up.

329
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,036
I'll be down in a minute.

330
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:58,415
Okay. There's no hurry.

331
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:23,316
Frank?

332
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:32,243
I'm hurting.

333
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:34,501
Hurting?

334
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:36,830
My nerves are beginning
to work again.

335
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,374
Good.

336
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:40,417
One more. Maybe two.

337
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,962
- Not again.
- To heal me completely.

338
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,674
Then we can be away from here
before they start to follow.

339
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,142
- Who?
- The Cenobites.

340
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:53,681
It's only a matter of time
before they find I've slipped them.

341
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:55,766
I must get away from here.

342
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:57,017
Julia?

343
00:42:57,893 --> 00:42:58,895
Are you all right?

344
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:04,901
Just a moment.

345
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:11,408
Put on some music,
will you, babe?

346
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:13,159
Yeah, sure.

347
00:43:14,286 --> 00:43:16,497
Poor Larry, obedient as ever.

348
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:18,874
Keep your voice down.

349
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:22,003
You don't want "babe" to hear.

350
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:24,505
You're hurting.

351
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:27,592
You won't cheat me, will you?

352
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,927
You'll stay with me.
Help me.

353
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:33,556
Then we can be together
the way we were before.

354
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:35,683
We belong to each other now.

355
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:39,061
For better, for worse.

356
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:45,067
Make love, only real.

357
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:01,543
I'm sorry, I'm new here.
You're gonna have to wait.

358
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:05,965
Could you not do that, please!

359
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:07,765
Where's the manager?

360
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,219
That's a problem too, because
he's out to lunch right now.

361
00:44:10,254 --> 00:44:12,096
I want to see somebody in charge.

362
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:15,475
Then you'll have to wait.

363
00:44:16,976 --> 00:44:19,187
- Excuse me.
- Well, excuse me!

364
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:24,567
What are you doing?-

365
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:35,745
You give those back.

366
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:42,335
Oh, my God!

367
00:44:45,756 --> 00:44:46,590
Get out!

368
00:44:47,883 --> 00:44:48,884
Get out of here!.

369
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:11,157
- Hi.
- Hi.

370
00:45:11,366 --> 00:45:13,577
Just came by to see
what you're doing after work.

371
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:15,745
What's wrong?

372
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:18,582
- Something weird.
- What?

373
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:26,881
Nothing.

374
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:39,563
You're sure we're not going
to be interrupted?

375
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:43,609
Quite sure.

376
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:45,527
Only I...

377
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:47,279
I like to be careful.

378
00:46:50,386 --> 00:46:51,887
I can taste that.

379
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,724
It's a long time
since I tasted anything.

380
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:01,522
You promised me an explanation.

381
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:05,150
This is it.

382
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:07,736
- Let me see.
- No, don't touch it!

383
00:47:08,112 --> 00:47:10,781
It's dangerous.
It opens doors..

384
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:14,208
What kind of doors?

385
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:17,038
Doors to the pleasures
of heaven or hell.

386
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:19,207
I didn't care which.

387
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:22,962
I thought I'd gone to the limits.
I hadn't.

388
00:47:23,588 --> 00:47:27,008
The Cenobites gave me
an experience beyond the limits.

389
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,511
Pain and pleasure.
Indivisible.

390
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:10,093
They won't get me back.

391
00:48:13,388 --> 00:48:15,515
I'm going to leave and
you're going to help me, yes?

392
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:16,809
Yes.

393
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:20,021
They'll never find us.

394
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:23,858
Not in the whole wide world.

395
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,031
"Boom Boom" has got him now!

396
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:32,742
"Boom Boom" has got him.

397
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:37,372
I thought this kind of stuff
made you sick.

398
00:48:39,874 --> 00:48:41,125
I've seen worse.

399
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:45,588
Are you all right?

400
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,049
Fine.

401
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,219
We can watch something else
if you feel like... Get him!

402
00:48:51,254 --> 00:48:52,054
Get him!

403
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,738
What was that?.

404
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,034
I think I left a window open upstairs.
I'll go see.

405
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:13,785
No.

406
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,752
Larry,

407
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,038
It was nothing.

408
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:20,041
Larry!

409
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,961
What's the matter with you,
anyway?

410
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,176
It's... it's just that I hate the thunder.

411
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,137
I'm here.

412
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,722
You're safe.

413
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,058
You're trembling.

414
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,647
There's nothing to be afraid of.

415
00:49:56,412 --> 00:50:00,499
Look. I really should check it out.

416
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,878
Don't go up there, please.

417
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:07,257
Look, we'll both go up.
Come on.

418
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:10,802
- Larry, please!
- Don't worry about it. Come on.

419
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:31,407
- Don't.
- It's okay. It's okay.

420
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:45,880
It's probably a rat.

421
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:48,174
I told you.

422
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:50,385
There's nothing to be afraid of.

423
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:56,183
Let's go downstairs.
I'll make it better?

424
00:51:10,823 --> 00:51:12,950
No, this is enough light.

425
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:18,039
Come on, let's go inside.

426
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:28,383
Oh, yes.

427
00:51:36,975 --> 00:51:38,602
Yes, yes.

428
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:48,195
Yes.

429
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,794
No!

430
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:07,507
No!

431
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,346
No, please, don't do it, please!

432
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:13,931
I can't bear it, please!

433
00:52:14,723 --> 00:52:16,266
Please, no!

434
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:19,937
Please!

435
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:22,606
Please, don't!

436
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:36,411
I can't bear it, please!
No!

437
00:52:36,703 --> 00:52:37,704
Look at you!

438
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,302
I don't understand you!

439
00:52:53,222 --> 00:52:54,473
I mean, one minute...

440
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,227
you're all over me, and the next...

441
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,274
I just don't understand you.

442
00:53:14,952 --> 00:53:15,953
I don't know.

443
00:53:17,037 --> 00:53:18,747
Maybe we shouldn't
have come back.

444
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:21,792
I mean, Brooklyn certainly wasn't
any worse than this.

445
00:53:23,085 --> 00:53:24,003
Look,

446
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:27,298
you love her, so there must be
something worth loving.

447
00:53:28,132 --> 00:53:29,675
I wish it were that simple.

448
00:53:31,385 --> 00:53:33,179
I got a real problem here, kiddo.

449
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:36,558
She doesn't even want
to leave the house.

450
00:53:37,058 --> 00:53:37,976
Really?

451
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:40,187
It's like she's...

452
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:42,356
waiting for something.

453
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:43,566
What?

454
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:46,235
I don't know.

455
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:50,740
I don't know.

456
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:53,951
It's way beyond me..

457
00:53:57,288 --> 00:53:58,122
Look,

458
00:54:00,124 --> 00:54:01,125
could you...

459
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:02,710
would you...

460
00:54:04,295 --> 00:54:05,880
stop by sometime?

461
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:08,549
Try to make friends?

462
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,635
Sure.

463
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:15,139
Who knows, maybe all she needs
is somebody to talk to.

464
00:54:15,806 --> 00:54:18,893
- You can't love him.
- You know I don't.

465
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:30,156
- So, where's the harm?
- I said, no!

466
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:32,909
Then find me somebody else,
before they come looking.

467
00:54:33,952 --> 00:54:34,702
Now!

468
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:12,282
I...

469
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:14,826
I get lonely sometimes.

470
00:55:18,455 --> 00:55:19,624
Everybody does.

471
00:55:36,516 --> 00:55:37,434
Come in.

472
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:42,564
What is this?

473
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:44,357
A game?

474
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,820
Jesus Christ!

475
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,335
Oh, Christ! Help me!

476
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,215
Oh, no!

477
00:56:14,723 --> 00:56:15,807
Get out of here!

478
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:19,811
Please, don't let him kill me.

479
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:51,781
No, please!

480
00:58:08,674 --> 00:58:09,307
No!

481
00:58:09,342 --> 00:58:12,845
- Kirsty, it's Frank, it's Uncle Frank.
- No!

482
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,096
- You remember.
- No!

483
00:58:14,847 --> 00:58:17,642
- Come to daddy.
- Get the fuck off me!

484
00:58:21,354 --> 00:58:23,648
You've grown.
You're beautiful.

485
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:27,276
Don't... don't touch me!

486
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:31,114
Don't touch me or so help me
I'll... I'll...

487
00:58:31,531 --> 00:58:32,616
What'll you do?

488
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:35,410
What can you do?

489
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:39,539
There's nothing to be afraid of.

490
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:44,211
I bet you make your daddy so proud,
don't you? Beautiful.

491
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:45,552
This isn't happening.

492
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:47,137
I used to tell myself that.

493
00:58:47,172 --> 00:58:49,383
Used to try and pretend
I was dreaming all the pain.

494
00:58:49,418 --> 00:58:50,635
But don't you kid yourself.

495
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,811
Some things have to be endured.

496
00:58:53,846 --> 00:58:57,267
And that's what makes
the pleasures so sweet.

497
00:59:09,821 --> 00:59:10,571
No!

498
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:12,657
Give me that!

499
00:59:16,662 --> 00:59:18,163
- No!
- Give it to me!

500
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,124
You want it?

501
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,167
One last time,

502
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,760
give me that box.

503
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,922
- You want it?
- Give me the box!

504
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:29,425
You wanna fucking have it?

505
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:32,970
No...!

506
00:59:46,735 --> 00:59:48,153
Kirsty.

507
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:51,823
Come to daddy.

508
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:12,845
It's Frank. You remember.
It's Uncle Frank.

509
01:00:33,115 --> 01:00:34,200
Are you all right?

510
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:06,067
You're awake!

511
01:01:09,821 --> 01:01:11,364
- Good girl.
- What happened?

512
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:14,367
- I'll get the doctor.
- Wait a minute. How did I get here?

513
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:15,952
I won't be a moment.

514
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:26,462
Please, get back into bed.

515
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:28,423
I have to call my father.

516
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:31,927
That's easily arranged, but first,
back into bed.

517
01:01:31,962 --> 01:01:35,180
- It's important. It really is...
- First things first.

518
01:01:36,265 --> 01:01:38,475
We'll get you a telephone
after we've talked.

519
01:01:41,229 --> 01:01:42,988
What about this?
Ring any bells?

520
01:01:43,023 --> 01:01:44,899
You were hanging on to it
like grim death.

521
01:01:47,402 --> 01:01:48,403
I don't remember.

522
01:01:48,862 --> 01:01:51,781
Well, the police will want
to speak to you. You know that.

523
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,117
Oh, Christ!

524
01:01:54,993 --> 01:01:58,663
In the meantime, maybe this
will jog your memory.

525
01:02:13,803 --> 01:02:14,804
Shit!

526
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:57,766
The box. You opened it.
We came.

527
01:06:58,016 --> 01:07:00,060
It's just a puzzle box!

528
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:01,228
Oh, no.

529
01:07:01,478 --> 01:07:04,815
- It is a means to summon us.
- Who are you?

530
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:09,194
Explorers in the further regions
of experience.

531
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:13,031
Demons to some.
Angels to others.

532
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:15,534
I was a mistake!

533
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:18,413
I didn't mean to open it!

534
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:20,331
It was a mistake!

535
01:07:21,582 --> 01:07:24,836
You can all go to hell!

536
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:27,671
We can't.
Not alone.

537
01:07:27,706 --> 01:07:29,847
You solved the box.

538
01:07:29,882 --> 01:07:32,969
We came. Now you must come
with us.

539
01:07:33,004 --> 01:07:34,929
Taste our pleasures.

540
01:07:35,346 --> 01:07:36,097
Please...

541
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,351
go away and leave me alone!

542
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:42,146
Oh, no tears, please.

543
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:44,565
It's a waste of good suffering.

544
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:49,320
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait, please, wait!

545
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:51,071
No time for argument.

546
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:53,991
You've done it before, right?

547
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:56,035
Many, may times.

548
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:00,247
To a man called Frank Cotton?

549
01:08:00,748 --> 01:08:02,124
Oh, yes.

550
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,168
He escaped you.

551
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:08,590
- Nobody escapes us.
- He did. I've seen him. I've seen him.

552
01:08:09,257 --> 01:08:11,635
- Impossible!
- He's alive!

553
01:08:12,135 --> 01:08:16,222
Supposing he had escaped us.
What has that to do with you?

554
01:08:17,057 --> 01:08:19,684
I can... I can lead you to him.

555
01:08:20,185 --> 01:08:23,688
And you can take him back
instead of me.

556
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:26,156
Perhaps we prefer you.

557
01:08:26,191 --> 01:08:28,401
I want to hear him confess himself,

558
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:30,695
then maybe...

559
01:08:31,822 --> 01:08:33,074
maybe...

560
01:08:33,449 --> 01:08:34,700
But if you cheat us.

561
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:40,456
We'll tear your soul apart.

562
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,714
She'll tell them everything..

563
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:52,176
I don't think so.
She'll want to warn Larry first.

564
01:08:52,468 --> 01:08:54,429
That's probably her now.

565
01:08:55,138 --> 01:08:57,265
- Or the police.
- It doesn't make any difference.

566
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:00,394
Don't you care?

567
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:02,646
What I care about is
a new skin.

568
01:09:03,397 --> 01:09:06,984
- Maybe we should just leave.
- Like this? Look at me.

569
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:09,319
We can't just stay here.

570
01:09:12,072 --> 01:09:14,032
My brother will be home soon.

571
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:31,551
What is it?

572
01:09:33,678 --> 01:09:35,096
I don't know where to begin.

573
01:09:36,723 --> 01:09:37,807
What are you talking about?

574
01:09:40,018 --> 01:09:41,812
It's best you see for yourself.

575
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,191
I left her here safe and sound.
I even locked the door.

576
01:09:46,226 --> 01:09:47,609
Well, she's not here now.

577
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,653
I'll start looking for her.

578
01:09:50,696 --> 01:09:52,114
Maybe she's gone back to...

579
01:09:53,991 --> 01:09:55,159
to her father's house..

580
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,125
Daddy?

581
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:46,045
Daddy, it's me, Kirsty!
Let me in!

582
01:10:47,713 --> 01:10:49,674
Daddy, let me in!

583
01:10:59,642 --> 01:11:02,311
Kirsty? It's very late.

584
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,521
Where is my dad?

585
01:11:04,355 --> 01:11:07,233
- What's the matter?
- I want to see my father!

586
01:11:09,235 --> 01:11:10,237
Of course.

587
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:23,501
Where is he?

588
01:11:23,835 --> 01:11:25,003
Where is he?!

589
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,754
Daddy?

590
01:11:27,297 --> 01:11:28,131
Daddy?,

591
01:11:28,589 --> 01:11:32,760
- Daddy, you're all right.
- Sure I am. Sure I am.

592
01:11:32,795 --> 01:11:35,847
- You're okay!
- It's okay.

593
01:11:36,431 --> 01:11:39,225
I was so afraid that
something happened to you.

594
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,810
I know, I know.

595
01:11:44,689 --> 01:11:47,066
- I need to talk to you.
- Yes?

596
01:11:47,442 --> 01:11:50,695
It's okay, baby, Julia told me
everything.

597
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:52,739
Oh, no, see...

598
01:11:54,532 --> 01:11:56,743
your brother Frank is upstairs.

599
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,955
He's upstairs and he's trying
to kill you. He's trying to kill you.

600
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,547
No, wait, wait, wait.

601
01:12:02,582 --> 01:12:05,044
Whatever did Frank
was unspeakable.

602
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:08,798
Unspeakable.

603
01:12:11,176 --> 01:12:12,719
But believe me,

604
01:12:14,137 --> 01:12:15,722
it's finished with now.

605
01:12:16,806 --> 01:12:18,058
Why is it finished?

606
01:12:18,725 --> 01:12:19,643
He's gone.

607
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,147
What's gone mean?

608
01:12:25,023 --> 01:12:26,358
He's dead, Kirsty.

609
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,575
He was insane, baby.

610
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,946
A mad dog. Had to put him
out of his misery.

611
01:12:33,365 --> 01:12:35,075
Jesus, what a scene.

612
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:40,121
And, when I'm feeling better,

613
01:12:41,081 --> 01:12:43,708
I'll go to the police and try
to make them understand.

614
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:45,251
God knows...

615
01:12:46,294 --> 01:12:48,672
I don't really understand myself.

616
01:12:52,342 --> 01:12:53,594
Did he hurt you, baby?

617
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:57,015
No, I'm okay.

618
01:12:59,184 --> 01:13:02,020
He's better off dead.
Poor Frank.

619
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:05,948
I don't believe this.

620
01:13:05,983 --> 01:13:08,443
- I don't believe this.
- Believe it.

621
01:13:13,573 --> 01:13:14,706
I need to see him.

622
01:13:14,741 --> 01:13:17,035
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do!

623
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:19,997
Yes!

624
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:24,209
Show her.

625
01:14:26,273 --> 01:14:30,987
We want the man who did this.

626
01:14:31,988 --> 01:14:32,739
No.

627
01:14:33,615 --> 01:14:35,332
No, that wasn't the deal.

628
01:14:35,367 --> 01:14:38,453
He's my father and you can't
have him. No!

629
01:14:44,502 --> 01:14:45,336
Move!

630
01:14:45,503 --> 01:14:46,337
Kirsty...

631
01:14:46,754 --> 01:14:47,672
Move!

632
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:01,644
What's the matter?

633
01:15:02,144 --> 01:15:03,027
There's no time.

634
01:15:03,062 --> 01:15:05,856
No way, no way, I told you
all that's over with now.

635
01:15:06,857 --> 01:15:09,485
No, it's not!
We've got to get out of here!

636
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,278
No, stay with us.

637
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:14,198
We can all be happy here.

638
01:15:17,619 --> 01:15:18,453
No.

639
01:15:20,163 --> 01:15:21,957
Come to daddy.

640
01:15:25,836 --> 01:15:27,295
Oh, my God!

641
01:15:28,046 --> 01:15:28,964
Come...

642
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,258
to daddy.

643
01:15:42,395 --> 01:15:43,813
- Ah!
- Frank!

644
01:15:52,697 --> 01:15:53,698
Well...

645
01:15:57,869 --> 01:16:01,289
so much for the cat
and mouse shit!

646
01:16:13,093 --> 01:16:14,011
No!

647
01:16:15,095 --> 01:16:16,555
Not me!

648
01:16:29,402 --> 01:16:31,613
It's nothing personal, baby.

649
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:52,634
Where are you, beautiful?

650
01:16:58,265 --> 01:17:01,185
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

651
01:20:01,539 --> 01:20:02,707
Oh, my God!

652
01:20:03,374 --> 01:20:04,292
Daddy.

653
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:05,668
Daddy!

654
01:20:07,212 --> 01:20:08,839
No, don't mourn him.

655
01:20:10,132 --> 01:20:12,509
He was dead long before
we ever touched him.

656
01:20:13,093 --> 01:20:15,304
- Bastard!
- Now, hush now.

657
01:20:16,472 --> 01:20:18,432
Everything's all right.

658
01:20:19,391 --> 01:20:20,768
Frank is here.

659
01:20:20,803 --> 01:20:21,483
Bastard!

660
01:20:21,518 --> 01:20:23,896
Your dear old Uncle Frank.

661
01:20:30,903 --> 01:20:32,488
What the hell is that?

662
01:21:24,834 --> 01:21:26,210
Frank.

663
01:21:27,253 --> 01:21:28,170
No!

664
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,507
We have to hear it
from your own lips.

665
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:35,302
This isn't for your eyes.

666
01:21:36,137 --> 01:21:39,557
You set me up, bitch!

667
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:48,254
Jesus wept.

668
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,905
Not leaving us so soon, are you?

669
01:23:53,947 --> 01:23:57,617
We have such sights to show you.

670
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,207
Oh, shit!

671
01:24:08,671 --> 01:24:09,470
No!

672
01:24:09,505 --> 01:24:12,425
- Don't do that!
- Go to hell!

673
01:24:43,499 --> 01:24:44,333
Kirsty!

674
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:46,960
Kirsty!

675
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:13,405
No.

676
01:25:34,844 --> 01:25:35,761
Steve!

677
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,142
oh, shit!

678
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:50,652
Oh, Kirsty! Thank God
you're okay.

679
01:25:51,903 --> 01:25:53,613
Let's get the hell out of here!
Now!

680
01:25:56,575 --> 01:25:57,576
Oh, no!

681
01:25:58,410 --> 01:25:59,953
Oh, God! No!

682
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:01,580
Open!

683
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,790
Steve! No!

684
01:30:06,293 --> 01:30:08,003
What's your pleasure, sir?
