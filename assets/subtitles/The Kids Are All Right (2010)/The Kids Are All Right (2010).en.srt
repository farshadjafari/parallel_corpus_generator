into something like that.
Yeah.

176
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,600
Great, Mr. Hatfield.
I'll let her know and get
back in touch soon.

177
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,900
Thanks.

178
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,200
Oh...

179
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,500
I mean,
I was 19 years old.

180
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
It was, like,
just so long ago.
I totally forgot about it.

181
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I never thought
they'd ever use my stuff.

182
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,300
TANYA: Why not?

183
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
Well, I'd use it.

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
Oh, baby.

185
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,200
It's weird.

186
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,900
There's a kid out there.
I mean, I'm kind of
curious, I think.

187
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,700
Yeah?
Yeah.

188
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
So what are you gonna do?

189
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,100
I don't know.
What would you do?

190
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,900
I don't know.

191
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,000
You got to figure it out.

192
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,900
Yeah, no doubt.

193
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,900
All right, I got to go now.
All right.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,700
Thanks for coming.
It was really nice.

195
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
So, drive safe.

197
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,000
JULES: M-E-R. "Zoomer."

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,200
JONI: No way.

199
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
That is so not a word.

200
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,400
No, it totally is.

201
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,900
That's not a word.
If you're gonna
zoom somewhere,

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
then you're a zoomer.
A person who zooms.

203
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

204
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,900
So that would be...
Let's see, that's 31...

205
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,000
Hello?

206
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
PAUL: Hi.
I'm looking for
Joni Allgood.

207
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah, this is she.

208
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,700
Hey.

209
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,000
(STUTTERING)
This is Paul,
your donor.

210
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,400
Eleven points
for Mommy.

211
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh! H i.

212
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,600
Hey. Don't be a zoomer.

213
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,700
PAUL: Hey.

214
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Come back.

215
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,400
Is this a good time to talk?

216
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,300
Yeah. No,
this is great.

217
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,700
So, how are you?
How are you?

218
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm good.
How are you?

219
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,700
I'm well, thanks.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Wendy at the Cryobank

221
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,100
was talking about maybe...

222
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,400
JONI: Oh, yeah. Well.

223
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,800
Actually, my brother
asked if I'd call you,

224
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,500
because I'm 18,
and he's only 15,
which is,

225
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,500
you know, which is
too young to call.

226
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Anyway, he'd like
to meet you.

227
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,300
You know,
if you want to.

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,500
Your brother?

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,700
Yeah. Well, technically
he's my half-brother.

230
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,100
Each of my moms had a kid,
you know, with...

231
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,700
With your...
With your sperm.

232
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
Like in both of them?

233
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah.

234
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,400
Like in two?

235
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,000
U h-huh. Like in gay.

236
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,600
Oh! Right. Right.
Right on.

237
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,300
Right on.
Yeah, cool. I...

238
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,900
I love lesbians.

239
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,600
Great.
So you wanna,

240
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I don't know, get a bite
to eat or something?
You and your brother?

241
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,700
I just don't want you
to have big expectations.

242
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,100
Will you quit saying that?
I have no expectations,
all right?

243
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,700
Okay. I'm just saying.
He might be weird.

244
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,600
I mean, he donated sperm.
That's weird.

245
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,500
Well, you know,
if he hadn't, we wouldn't
be here, so respect.

246
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,700
Hello?

247
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,600
Hey. Hey.

248
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,300
You're Joni, right?
H i, I'm Joni.

249
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm Paul. N ice to meet you.
N ice to meet you.

250
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
You must be Laser?
Laser, yeah.

251
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,600
Right on.
That's a very cool name.

252
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,800
Thanks.

253
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,200
Well...

254
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,000
Cool.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Listen, you know, feel free
to ask me anything,
anything you want.

257
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,300
Cool, thanks. Yeah.
Cool.

258
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,600
Laser, do you have
any questions that
you wanna ask?

259
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,800
Go ahead, shoot.
Anything.

260
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,400
I didn't really have any,
you know, specific questions
or anything, so...

261
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Nothing?

262
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,700
Not really.

263
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,100
Well, I mean,
I'd love to know more
about you guys.

264
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Everything. I mean...

265
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,900
So what do you do, Joni?
What are you into?

266
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,500
I just graduated high school,
and I'm starting college
in the fall, so...

267
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.

268
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,200
Thanks.

269
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,200
LASER: Yeah,
Joni's the brains
in the family.

270
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
She's got the National
Merit Scholarship for science.

271
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,500
Shut the front door.

272
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,900
Okay, Laser, thanks.

273
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
Wow.
LASER: I'm just telling him
you're smart.

274
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,000
No, I just work
harder than you.

275
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,100
Hey, Laze, seriously,
don't sweat school, man.

276
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,500
I mean, I didn't do well in
school either, and I'm not
doing so badly now, right?

277
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,000
It's Laser. Yeah.

278
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Sorry. Laser. Right.

279
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,600
LASER: It's cool.

280
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,200
So, what are you
into, Laser?

281
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,900
Laser's an amazing athlete.

282
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,700
Really? Yeah?

283
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,200
Did you ever play
any sports in school or...

284
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,900
PAUL: I did a little
B-ball in junior high.

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,400
That's cool.
Was that it or...

286
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,400
Well, the whole "team" thing
just got on my nerves
after a while, you know?

287
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,000
It was like,
"Hey, let's go kick
some ass, man! " And...

288
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,300
What about you?

289
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,900
I play soccer,
basketball, baseball.

290
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
You know,
all the team
sort of sports.

291
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
PAUL: Hey, man,

292
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,500
I wasn't generally
bagging on teams.

293
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,800
I mean, teams are great.
I'm just weird that way.

294
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,200
I like teams.
They're cool.

295
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,200
Cool.

296
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,400
So this is your
place, right?

297
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah, yeah, this is mine.
It's cool.

298
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,700
You know,
I've been working
on it for a while.

299
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,500
I also have a little
organic co-op farm just
up the street here.

300
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,000
Just keeping it kind
of local and organic

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
and simple,
American food.

302
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
That's so cool.
I'm totally into local.

303
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
PAUL: Yeah?
You are?

304
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Yeah, Laser.

305
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,600
I've been trying to get
Moms, you know,
to buy local for ages.

306
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,800
LASER: All right.

307
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,800
We're just over here. There.
LASER: Right. Yeah.

308
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,500
Okay.

309
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,900
Is that your bike?

310
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Yeah, yeah.
You like motorcycles?

311
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,800
Yeah, I love them,

312
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,200
but, you know,
our moms are kind
of anti-motorcycle.

313
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,100
By "kind of" he means
that they'd kill us if
we ever rode one, so...

314
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,900
Oh, that's too bad.
They're a lot of fun.

315
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,400
Yeah, I'm sure.

316
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,100
Cool.

317
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,300
PAUL: Cool.
JONI: Yeah.

318
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,400
It was great...
Great meeting you, yeah.

319
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,700
N ice to meet you, too.

320
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,300
Yeah. It's okay,
right? Good?

321
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,400
JONI: Yeah, for sure.

322
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,700
Hey, Laser,
really nice to meet you.

323
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Yeah, you too.

324
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,900
PAUL: All right.
LASER: All right.

325
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
So long.

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
Bye.

327
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,400
Keep in touch.
Yeah.

328
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,900
Okay?
Yeah.

329
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
(INAUDIBLE)

330
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,400
Wow. I just never
pictured him that way,
you know?

331
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,800
He was so cool
and interesting.

332
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,500
Yeah, he's all right.

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
What do you mean
"all right"?

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,800
Laser, you're the one
who wanted to meet him
so bad.

335
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,400
I know.

336
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,800
Yeah, so what did
you think of him?

337
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,200
I think he's all right.

338
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,000
I mean, I think he's
a little into himself.

339
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
God.
What?

340
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,600
You're asking my opinion.
Whatever.

341
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
We are so not telling Moms.

342
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Why not?

343
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,300
Ha, ha. Very funny.

344
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,900
He wants to die!

345
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,300
He wants to die.

346
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Remind me not to take
heroin in Morocco.
Or Uganda.

347
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,400
Yeah. I hate it
when that happens.

348
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,800
MAN: (ON TV)
...it is now time to call it.

349
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,600
Someone took my knife.
I want my knife back!

350
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,100
(DOOR CLOSING)

351
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,100
Hey, bug, come here.

352
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,300
We're watching
Locked Up Abroad.

353
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,400
MAN: (ON TV)
I want my knife back!

354
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,600
Yeah, I've seen
that one. It's good.

355
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,900
Where you going?

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Clay's.

357
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
NIC: Don't be back late.

358
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I know, I know, I know.

359
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
Hey, hey. Come give us
a hug before you go.

360
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,600
H ugs.
Come on.

361
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
No, Mom.

362
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,700
Hug her. That's what
she's there for.

363
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,100
Maybe we should
just sit him down
and ask him already.

364
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,100
What? "Are you
and Clay fucking?"

365
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,500
"Exploring" is
a better word.

366
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah, well, so, you know,
what if they are "exploring"?

367
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
This is the age for that.

368
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
We should be
good with that.

369
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
We should. We should.

370
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,100
I just don't understand
why he's exploring
with that loser.

371
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,500
We don't really know
what's going on. We shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

372
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,000
I feel like he has
so much potential.
He's just wasting it.

373
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,400
(SCOFFING)

374
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
What are you
trying to say?

375
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,600
What do you mean,
what am I trying to say?

376
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,300
I just, you know,
I feel like there's
some subtext here.

377
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
What are you
talking about?

378
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,600
You know,
"like mother,
like son"?

379
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,200
Both of us wandering
in the dark, aimless,
"wasting our potential."

380
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,500
Honey, you're on
a whole other tangent.

381
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,700
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

382
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,400
Well, you know, maybe
it hasn't risen to the plane
of consciousness for you yet.

383
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,300
Yeah. Maybe.

384
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,500
Someone took my knife.

385
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,400
So what were they like?

386
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
They were
really sweet kids.

387
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,400
The boy was this little,
you know, kind of
sensitive jock-type kid,

388
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,200
and the girl was
really innocent

389
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,900
but just whip-smart
and super, super cute.

390
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Sounds like you
really liked them,
like you guys connected.

391
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,200
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I kind of did.

392
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,600
Wow.
So how'd you leave it?

393
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,100
I mean, are you
gonna see them again?

394
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
I... Hey, Brooke.

395
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,800
Hey, Paul.
Check these out.

396
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,200
PAUL: How you doing?
BROOKE: Good.

397
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,200
Wow, look at those
strawberries, man.

398
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,200
They're just...

399
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,400
Aren't they beautiful?

400
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,100
I thought you should
have the first taste.

401
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,800
PAUL: Thank you.

402
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,500
"I thought you should
have the first taste"
of my pussy.

403
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,100
(LAUGHING)
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,100
Dude, I don't even
think they smoke pot.

405
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Dude, hold up.

406
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
(CLAY EXCLAIMING)

407
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,500
Come on, let's go.
Seriously.

408
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,000
(BUZZING)

409
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh! Dude!

410
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,200
God, disgusting!
Come on, let's go.

411
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,400
It's alive, dude!

412
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,600
Put it back.

413
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,100
Fine, fine, fine.

414
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
Sweet!

415
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
Dude, we're watching this.

416
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,900
You think the whole
thing's like this?

417
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
LASER: Maybe...

418
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,800
Maybe we should
fast forward.

419
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Laser, you left your bike
in the driveway again.

420
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,500
NIC: Laser, your mom
and I accept and love
you unconditionally.

421
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,700
You know that, right?

422
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,900
Yeah.

423
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,500
Yeah. And you know that
you can be open with us
about anything.

424
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,800
Yeah, I know.
Okay.

425
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,900
Laser, do you
want to talk to us
about anything?

426
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,000
Like what?

427
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,200
J ust anything.

428
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,000
You know, anything
on your mind.

429
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Well, there is something.
But it's more of
a question, though.

430
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,700
That's okay.

431
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,700
We won't judge you.

432
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,900
Why do you guys
watch gay man porn?

433
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,100
Well, first I have to say
that we rarely watch
that movie.

434
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
Honey.

435
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,700
And, second,
I really don't
appreciate

436
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,400
you snooping around
our room, okay?

437
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,400
Was that Clay's idea?
No, Mom.

438
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,900
Wait a minute.
I have to say, again,
I don't like him.

439
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,200
I know. I know.

440
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Okay, he seems unstable.

441
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,100
Honey, honey,
that's not what he asked.

442
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
Do you want to answer
his question?

443
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,100
Yeah, okay.

444
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,700
Well, sweetie, you know,
human sexuality
is complicated.

445
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,000
And sometimes desire can be,
you know, counterintuitive.

446
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,900
You know, for example,

447
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,700
because women's
sexual responsiveness
is internalized,

448
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,800
sometimes it's exciting
for us to see responsiveness
externalized,

449
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,700
like with a...
Like with a penis.

450
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,600
Wouldn't you guys
just rather watch girls
doing it, though?

451
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,200
Well, you would think that.

452
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,400
But usually in these movies,
they hire two straight
women to pretend,

453
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable.

454
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,500
Whoa, that's enough.

455
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,700
Laser, your mom
and I sense

456
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,900
that there's some
other stuff going on
in your life.

457
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
We just want
to be let in.

458
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,600
What do you mean?

459
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Are you having a relationship
with someone?

460
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,700
You can tell us, honey.
We would understand
and support you.

461
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
Look, I only met him once.

462
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,200
What do you mean once?

463
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,500
Did he find you online?
NIC: Wait.

464
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,900
What?
Wait, wait, who did
you meet once?

465
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,100
Paul. I met him with Joni.

466
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
JULES: Paul? Who's Paul?

467
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,100
Why was Joni there?
She set it up.

468
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,500
Wait, forget the set-up.
Who's Paul?

469
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,100
Our sperm donor.

470
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Did you guys think
I was gay?

471
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
No.

472
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,900
No way.

473
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
JULES: Of course not.

474
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, I mean, we understand
that you'd be curious

475
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
about your biological father.

476
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,000
I mean,
it's completely natural.

477
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,900
But why didn't you tell us?

478
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,200
Because we knew
you'd be upset.

479
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,100
We're not upset!
No, no, no.

480
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,300
We're not. We wish that
you'd included us in
the conversation.

481
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
That's all.

482
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,400
You know? But...
But you met him,
and that's cool.

483
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,600
And now,
we can move on.

484
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,500
Actually,
I want to see him again.

485
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,000
You do?

486
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,400
Yeah, I was
gonna tell you.

487
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,400
Well, no. Okay?
No way.

488
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,200
No one's seeing anyone
until we meet him.

489
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,000
I get it, okay?
He's their biological father
and all that crap.

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,500
But it still feels
really shitty.

491
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,500
Like we're not enough
or something, you know?

492
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,100
Of course I know.
You know, I don't...

493
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
I don't want to time-share
our kids with anybody.

494
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Especially when
it's Joni's last summer
at home.

495
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,800
No way.

496
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,300
Jesus, Jules!

497
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,000
The plumber was just here.
God, it's gross.

498
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,700
(SOFTLY) Look, we have to be
smart about this.

499
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,200
You know, if we act like
grubby bitches, we're just
gonna make it worse.

500
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,000
I know.

501
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,000
Let's just kill him
with kindness
and put it to bed.

502
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,900
I'm with you, honey.

503
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,700
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

504
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,100
I love you, chicken.

505
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,100
I love you, too, pony.

506
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,600
Paul. It's so great
to meet you. H i. Yeah.

507
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,100
Great to meet you, too.

508
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,300
Hey. Jules.
Hello, Jules.

509
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,100
I'm Nic.
Hi, Nic.

510
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Hi.

511
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,900
I hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.

512
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,600
No, I took my motorcycle,
so I pretty much just
weave through it.

513
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh, great.

514
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I brought you this.

515
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,400
I don't know if
you folks drink wine.

516
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,300
Oh, no, are you kidding?
We love it.

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,100
Wow, a Petite Sirah.
What a treat!

'86.

519
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,700
Yeah. I'll get
some glasses.
All right.

520
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,700
Yeah. Wow.

521
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,600
Beautiful house.
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.

522
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,800
You guys been here
a long time?

523
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,500
Yeah. You know,
about 10 years.

524
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
God, has it been
that long? I mean...

525
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,100
That's... Yeah.
You know them, yeah.

526
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,600
Hey, Joni.
How you doing?

527
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,400
Good, how are you?
Good.

528
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,300
Hey, man.
Hey.

529
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,800
What's up, man?

530
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,300
You okay?

531
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,100
Yeah. Yeah, great.

532
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's daytime.

533
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Okay. Same goes
for the micromanaging.
Okay?

534
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,200
So, Paul, did you
always know that...

535
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Yes.

536
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,600
...that you wanted to be
in the food services industry?

537
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,800
I always liked food.

538
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,200
Oh, yeah.

539
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,500
No, I was asking
because I remember when
I was reading your file,

540
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,100
back when we were
looking for,

541
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,600
you know, sperm...

542
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,100
Can I have the potato
salad, babe?
Sure.

543
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Anyway, you said
that you were studying
international relations.

544
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,300
Oh, yeah. Wow, that was a...
That was a long time ago.

545
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,700
Yeah, I was considering it,
but then I dropped out
of school.

546
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,000
You dropped
out of college?

547
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
Yeah, it just
wasn't my thing.

548
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,700
No? Why's that?
PAUL: I don't know.

549
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,200
It just seemed like
a massive waste of money
after a while, you know?

550
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,100
I was just sitting
on my ass listening
to people spout ideas

551
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,700
I could just as easily
have learned in a book.

552
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
Oh.

553
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,200
Okay.

554
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,400
I'm not saying that,
you know,

555
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,300
I think that higher learning
uniformly blows.

556
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,700
You know, I think
college is great
for some people.

557
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,400
Joni, I'm sure
you're gonna love it.

558
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,400
But just... I'm a doer.
That's how I learn.

559
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,400
It's just me.
I'm weird that way, I guess.
Thank you.

560
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Which is probably why
I'm in the food services
industry.

561

(ALL LAUGHING)

562
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,400

LASER: Hey, Mom,
you see what he did
there, right?

564
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,600
You said "food
services industry,"

565
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,000
so then he said
"food services industry."

566
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
Yeah. I got that,
Laser. Thanks.

567
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,800
So, Paul,
what about your...

568
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,300
What about
your social life?

569
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
My social life?

570
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,900
Yeah, you know,
are you married, divorced,
seeing anyone?

571
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
Mom.
NIC: What?

572
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,700
We're getting
to know Paul.
It's okay.

573
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,500
No, no, it's okay. I...
No, I've never been
married nor divorced.

574
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I date sometimes,

575
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,700
but I'm really just
kind of focused on my
restaurant right now.

576
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,800
NIC: Well, that's...
Yeah. Makes sense.

577
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,300
So, cheers.

578
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,800
Yeah. Cheers.

579
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,200
Excellent wine,
by the way.

580
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,400
Thank you.

581
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,900
How old are you again?

582
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000

NIC: No, that's okay.

585
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,800
JULES: I like
to be positive.

00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,900
NIC: Yeah.

587
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,100
So how'd you two meet?

588
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,600
We met at UCLA.

589
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,300
I was a resident,

590
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
and Jules had
an emergency.

591
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
My tongue was numb.

Oh, my God.

00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,000
It's not nice.

596
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,300
No, that's not nice.
I mean, we've heard
that story 100, 000 times.

597
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,000
What happened
to your tongue?
I don't know.

598
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,300
I mean, I lost all
the feeling in my face
and my tongue.

599
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,000
And then, you know, I got
really nervous 'cause
I thought that I was gonna gag

600
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,700
and, you know,
maybe like...

601
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Choke? Die?

602
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,500
Yeah, exactly.

603
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
What'd you do to help her?

604
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
NIC: I gave her a Valium,

605
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,100
and I told her to relax
and tried to get her to talk,

606
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,300
you know,
move her tongue around.
Yeah.

607
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,500
Actually,
she started teasing me,
and that really helped.

608
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,100
I was trying
to distract you.

609
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,400
I know. It worked.
You were really funny.

610
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,700
You were really pretty.

611
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,000

working again.

you're a doctor,

you into, Jules?

What do you do?

622
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,600
Well, you know,
I mean, I studied
architecture in college.

623
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
PAUL: Right.

624
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,200
But I'm not
really an architect.

625
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,900
I mean, I was on my way
to becoming one,

626
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,400
but I quit before
the kids were born.

627
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,600
That happens.

628
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,000
And then when they got
a little bit older,

629
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,600
I started
a Balinese furniture
import business.

630
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,100
Right on.

631
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,400
But that didn't
really work out.

businesses aren't easy.

633
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600

But I'm in the process
of starting a new business.

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,400
Great, good for you.
What's that?

636
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,700
Landscape design.
I mean, you know,
not gardening.

00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
I mean, you know,
there's a gardening
component,

638
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,800
but, really, the real work
is in creating unique,

with the surrounding

tell Paul about your
graduation speech?

645

No, she didn't tell me.

wisdom and hope.

would like to hear it.

I'm sure he wouldn't.

thanks for counting.

Hey, I was...
You know, I was thinking.

661
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,300
I just bought this place
last year, and it's...

662
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,400
I mean,
the backyard's a wreck.

663
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,500

in maybe coming and doing
some work for me?

PAUL: No, seriously.
I can't...

666
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,800
I don't have time
to do it myself and...

667
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,600
Well, I mean,
that's really sweet of you,

668
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,000
but you should think
about it, you know.

669
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,800
PAUL: No, why?
I just did.

670
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,300
I mean, it's all right
if you're not up for it.
It's okay.

671
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,600
No, I am.
I'm up for it. Yeah.

00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,200
Yeah? Yeah?

Excellent.

677
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,100
Right on.
Yeah.

678
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm just saying,
the plan was to limit
his involvement.

679
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,900
You're unbelievable.
I mean, you're all about
me getting clients.

680
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,800
And then I get a client,
and you're like,
"Oh, no, not him."

681
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
Yeah. But he's not
just a client, Jules.

682
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,300
He's our sperm donor.

683
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,800
I mean, haven't you
heard the expression
"don't shit where you eat"?

684
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,500
Yes, and I think
it's disgusting.

685
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,500
Okay, I'm sorry.
Look, he just seemed
so self-satisfied to me.

686
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
You know?

687
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Yeah, he was working
the "alternative" thing
pretty hard.

688
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,900
Oh, my God.
When he said
that thing about,

689
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,200
"Oh, I just need to get
outside and do things,
not sit on my ass and learn.

690
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,600
"But that's just me, you know.
I'm weird that way."

691
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,700
(SIGHING)

692
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,700
I'd certainly clean up
a lot of this grass.
It's pretty... It's wasted.

693
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,900
Sure.

694
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,600
The lavender
is so nice.

695
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,600
And with the sun that
you have, that and,
like, that rosemary,

696
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,000
which kind of grow everywhere,
and you wouldn't even have

697
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
to think about it.
Yeah.

698
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,800
You could go like a whole,
like, Secret Garden,
kind of a trellis-y,

699
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,400
like hidden kind of thing.

700
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,600
Or you could, you know,
you could go like Asian-y.

701
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,500
Minimal. You know, like rocks
and kind of all clean and...

702
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,900
Whatever you think.

703
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,500
Well,
what do you think?

704
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,400
You know what? I'm not...
I'm not feeling minimal.

705
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,100
I really... I'm really
liking more is more.

706
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,300
You know? I mean,
let's not try to tame
this space, okay?

707
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,100
Let's just let it be
like lush,

708
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,100
overgrown, fecund.

709
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,300
Fecund.

710
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Like fertile, yeah?

711
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,900
No, I love that word.
You just, you don't hear
people use it very often.

712
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
No, yeah.

713
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,100
Yeah, more is more.
Yeah, I like that.

714
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Right on.
Let's do that.

715
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,600
I'm sorry.
What?

716
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,000
I just keep seeing
my kids' expressions
in your face.

717
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Really?
Yeah.

718
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,800
Like that. Like, "Really?"
Like, yeah. That's like Laser.

719
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,000
Hmm.

720
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,300
Well...

721
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,400
Do you like patios?

722
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,800
Yeah, patios are good. Okay.

723
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,200
Yeah.

724
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,100
We could put
a patio up there.
Where?

725
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,600
Let's take a look.

726
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500
SASHA: Hello. Donor Dad?
Stone cold fox.

727
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,000
Must you take
everything beautiful
and make it dirty?

728
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,000
Okay.

729
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,700
I'm just saying.
Spermster's a hottie.

730
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,300
Is he single?

731
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
(GROANING) Okay.
First of all, ew,

732
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
and second,
he's a really good person.

733
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,700
So I'd prefer it
if you didn't taint him
with your whore juice.

734
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,500
Fair enough, hairy muff.
I'm out of here.

735
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,500
You lovebirds can
split my letters.

736
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,500
Do you want
to keep playing?

737
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,800
Sure.

738
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,200
Okay.

739
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,400
Sometimes I feel sorry
for Sasha, you know?

740
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,700
Yeah.

741
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,000
It's like she has to sexualize
every experience, you know?

742
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,500
It's just sad.

743
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That's sad.

744
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,100
JULES: Oh, come on.

745
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Hi ya, what's the score?

746
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,400
Pretty close.

747
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,100
NIC: Yeah?
20 to three. Match point.

748
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,900
So how'd it go today?

749
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It was good.
We settled on a concept.

750
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,400
Ah. What is it?

751
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,300
Well, you know,
it's kind of...

752
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,900
It's kind of hard to explain.

753
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
You really have
to see the space.

754
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Okay. Hey, Laser,
did you write the get-well
card for Pup-pup?

755
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
(SIGHING)

756
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,200
Laser, come on.

757
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,800
What do I have to do?
I bought you the card.
I put it on your desk.

758
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,000
All you have
to do is sign it.

759
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,600
Mom, just settle down,
okay? I'll do it.

760
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,900
Hey. You don't tell me
to settle, mister.

761
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,900
If it's not in the mail
by tomorrow morning,

762
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,300
we're not going
to the Dodger game
Saturday, okay?

763
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,900
Whatever. I have
other plans anyways.

764
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,200
What other plans?

765
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,100
I asked you a question.

766
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,900
I said I'd do something
with Paul, okay? God!

767
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,100
Shit!

768
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
I believe this might not
be such a good idea.

769
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,200
Are you filming?
Yeah.

770
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,000
He's not gonna make that.
You're not gonna make that,
Clay. No way.

771
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,600
Let's do something
different.

772
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,500
Will you quit being
such a choch and
run the camera?

773
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm only doing this once,
so keep my shit in frame.

774
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,500
LASER: All right.

775
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,100
All right, I got it.

776
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,000
(GROANING)

777
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,200
Shit! Dude!

778
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,500
(GROANING)

779
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,700
Clay, are you all right?
Fuck!

780
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Did you get it, dude?
PAUL: Clay,
you all right, bro?

781
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,400
Seriously, are you okay?
I'm fucking fine! Fuck!

782
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,000
Did you fucking
get it? God!

783
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,300
Yeah, I got it.

784
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,600
Fuck, dude.
PAUL: Clay...

785
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,600
That was fucking crazy.

786
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,500
PAUL: Where's your place,
Clay, up here?

787
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,800
CLAY: Yeah, right here
on the right.

788
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,700
This is good.
PAUL: Cool here?

789
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,300
Yeah.

790
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,600
You take care.
Later.

791
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,000
See you.

792
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,200
Let's wait till
he gets to the house.

793
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,200
Maybe we could
hang out together just
you and me next time.

794
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,700
Clay's cool. He just...
You know, he gets
a little amped sometimes.

795
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,700
That's not amped, man.
That's being a tool.

796
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
No, he's not a tool, okay?
That's just his way.

797
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
Yeah, I don't like the way
he was talking to you at all.

798
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,100
Well, you know what?
You don't know him
very well, do you?

799
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,900
I mean, you hung out
with him once.

800
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,300
You're right.
I don't know him.

801
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,600
Can I ask you something?

802
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,000
Sure.

803
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Why'd you donate sperm?

804
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,700
It just seemed like
a lot more fun than
donating blood.

805
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,600
No, I loved the idea
of helping people.

806
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,500
People who were in need,
you know, wanted to
have kids and couldn't.

807
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,000
So then you did it
to help people?

808
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
It was a long time ago.

809
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,700
How much did you
get paid?

810
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
Why do you want
to know that?

811
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,700
I'm just curious.

812
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,700
I got paid 60 bucks a pop.

813
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,300
That's it?

814
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,700
Well, it was, like,
a lot of money to me
at the time.

815
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,100
And with inflation,
it's like $90 today.

816
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Hey.

817
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm glad I did it.

818
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,600
Whoa.

819
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
What's this?

820
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,900
H i. Come here.

821
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,300
Come here. Sit down.

822
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,600
I'm sorry that
I've been so edgy lately,
you know.

823
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,200
I know I haven't
been my highest self.

824
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,500
Yeah.

825
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,300
And you've been
really patient with me.

826
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,900
And I just want you to know
that that hasn't gone
unrecognized, okay?

827
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,500
How's the water?

828
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,600
It's perfect.
You wanna come in?

829
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,300
In a minute.
You enjoy it first.

830
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,500
(SIGHING)

831
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,700
I forgot
the lavender bath salts.

832
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,500
Oh, I don't care.
No, no, no.

833
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,400
I wanna get them.
I got them special.

834
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,400
Don't go. Don't.

835
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,500
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

836
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,000
(SIGHING)

837
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,500
Nic?

838
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,900
Hey, Nic?

839
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
Jesus!

840
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,700
NIC: U h-huh.

841
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,500
Right. No,
I understand.

842
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,200
I understand where
the pain is, but it doesn't
sound like a contraction.

843
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,900
It sounds more like gas.
(MOUTHING) I'm sorry.

844
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,200
Fuck!

845
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,100
Right. Okay.

846
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,400
All right, this is our plan.
I don't think
you should worry,

847
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,600
and I think you should
just call me back
if it continues.

848
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,500
PAUL: You sure you don't
want any coffee?

849
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,700
No thanks.

850
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,200
It's good.

851
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,500
JULES: I'm all right.

852
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,300
But I think I'm gonna go
to the nursery tomorrow,

853
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,400
so I want you
to sign off on
this Bougainvillea.

854
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,700
PAUL: Sure.

855
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
What is this?

Where do you
want the stones?

Stones?

1052
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,000
Over by the fence.

What?

1054
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,900
I was using the bathroom.

Do you need to use
the bathroom?

Would you rather
be buried or cremated?

That's your question?

1071

But why? I mean,

1075
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,300
you're just gonna be
taking up more
space in the earth.

1076
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't know.
The idea of being,
you know,

1077
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,600
torched into a chalky
white substance has got me
a little freaked out.

Why does it matter to you?
You're not even
gonna be conscious.

Okay, well, maybe,
I don't know,

1080
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,900
I want a place
for people to come
and visit me one day.

But why?
You're gonna be dead.

1082
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,000
You won't even
know they're there.

1083

Okay. Take it easy.

1084

Come on.

00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,800
So, what do you like better,
Nike or New Balance?

Nike.
Oh, God, here we go.

It's so beautiful.

Thank you.

Is it African?

Yes, it's Ethiopian.

1093
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
Did you get it there?

1094
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,500
No, I got it
at a flea market
in Brooklyn.

1095
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,400
Is that where you're from?

1096
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,200
No, I'm from here.

1097
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,900
Cool.
Hey, guys, how you doing?

1098
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,300
Good.
How's the food?

1099
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
It's great.

1100
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,700
Good? You're not
gonna eat your chicken?

1101
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,400
It's so yummy.
It's good?

1102
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,600
Yeah, it's really good.

1103
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,700
I'm sorry, but I have
to take the lovely Tanya
away for a moment.

1104
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,200
All right. It was lovely
talking to you, ladies.

1105
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,100
You, too.
You, too.

1106
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:38,700
Okay, I'm sorry, but
your donor daddy is
giving me the sex vibe.

1107
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,900
No, he's not.
He wouldn't do that.

1108
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,400
Why not?
He's not my dad.

1109
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,200
God, Sasha,
that's totally gross!

1110
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,400
Not everybody
wants to have sex
with you, okay?

1111
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Especially when
you act like a slut.

1112
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,700
Fuck you.

1113
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,100
Well, it makes
you seem insecure
and desperate.

1114
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,400
I'm not insecure
and desperate.

1115
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,200
I'm just a normal,
sexual person.

1116
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,100
Maybe you'd understand that
if you weren't so uptight.

1117
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,000
Fuck you.
I'm not uptight.

1118
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,700
STELLA: Oh, my God,
these heirloom tomatoes
are amazing.

1119
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,300
Oh, yeah,
they're in season.

1120
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,500
You know, Joni brought
some home from Paul's
garden the other day.

1121
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,100
They were huge.

1122
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,500
So the kids have
been spending time
with him?

1123
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,800
Yeah. Yeah, they're
spending all kinds of
quality time together.

1124
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,800
Well, you're lucky.
You're lucky that the kids
bonded with the donor.

1125
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,700
I mean, you hear so
many nightmare stories.

1126
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,800
No, no, it's great.
They all just get
along famously.

1127
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,700
Apparently, Paul
can do no wrong.

1128
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,600
Excuse me. Could we get
another bottle of the
Seavey Cabernet?

1129
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,200
Thank you.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I don't need any more.

1130
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah, you're alone
on this one, N icole.

1131
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,200
Hey, so have you guys
gotten into the whole acai
smoothie craze?

1132
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,500
JULES: Acai fruit packs.

1133
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,500
Yeah. No, but they're
pushing them like crack
at Whole Foods.

1134
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,200
Joel is so addicted to it.
He buys it by the case.

1135
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,600
JOEL: Here's what I do.

1136
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:07,100
I throw one in the blender
with bananas, frozen
strawberries and hemp milk.

1137
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,700
And I'll tell you what,
it is pretty sensational.

1138
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,700
J ust fucking kill me.
Okay?

1139
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,600
Honey.
I'm sorry, guys,

1140
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:18,800
but I just can't with
the fucking hemp milk
and the organic farming.

1141
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,100
And, you know, if I hear
one more person say that
they love heirloom tomatoes,

1142
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,100
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself. Okay?

1143
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,300
Oh. And do you know
that we're composting now?

1144
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Oh, yeah.
"No, don't throw that
in the trash.

1145
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,700
"You have to put it
in the composting bin

1146
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,300
"where all the beautiful
little worms will turn it
into this organic mulch,

1147
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,400
"and then we'll all
feel good about
ourselves." You know?

1148
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,400
I can't do it, okay?
I can't fucking do it.

1149
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,300
Hey, babe. How about
some green tea?

1150
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,300
You know what, J ules?
I like my wine, okay?
So fucking sue me.

1151
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,800
And FYI, red wine
has a chemical called
resveratrol in it,

1152
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,200
which has been proven
to significantly extend
human lifespan.

1153
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,900
If you drink, like,
a thousand glasses a day,
yeah.

1154
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,600
Fuck you.

1155
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,500
I'm sorry.
STELLA: It's okay.

1156
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,200
Go to her.

1157
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,700
(MOUTHING) Whoa.

Oh, my God.
What is going on with you?

1161
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,500
It's this whole Paul thing.

1162
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,000
It's just driving me
crazy, all right?

1163
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,900
I feel like
he's taking over
my family.

1164
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,300
No. He's...

1165
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,600
BARTEN DER:
Can I get you anything?

1166
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,100
No thanks, no.
He's not. He's not.

1167
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,400
Okay.

1168
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,800
Okay, I'm sorry,
all right?

1169
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,900
I guess I'm just exhausted.

1170
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,900
Yeah, maybe you just
need to take some
time off, recharge.

1171
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,100
Right?

1172
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,900
Yeah, right.
Who's gonna pay
for that?

1173
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,800
I mean, look,
I'm sorry,

1174
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,300
but, you know, I feel
like I'm carrying
the whole load here.

1175
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,900
Yeah, 'cause that's
the way you like it.

1176
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,500
That's the way
you keep control.

1177
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,300
What are you
talking about?

1178
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,800
Come on,
you hated it
when I worked.

1179
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,500
You wanted me at home
taking care of the kids.

1180
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,400
You wanted a wife.
That is just not true.

1181
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,100
No, you didn't like
any of the nannies,

1182
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,900
and you sure didn't
back my career.

1183
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,300
What are you talking about?
I just helped you start
another business.

1184
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,400
Yeah, so you can feel
better about yourself.

1185
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,700
No, Jules.
So you can feel better
about yourself.

1186
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,300
Are you even attracted
to me anymore?

1187
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,500
BARTEN DER: Would you
still like the wine?

1188
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,500
NIC: No, thank you.
We'll just take the check
from inside, please.

1189
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,200
BARTEN DER: Okay, no problem.

1190
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,600
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.

1191
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,500
PAUL: Okay. Oh, yeah.

1192
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,100
Okay.

1193
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,100
PAUL: Ow!

1194

(JULES MOANING)

1195
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:20,000
I really want a cigarette.
I haven't smoked
since Laser was born.

1196
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,500
Do you smoke?
Do you have a cigarette?

1197
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,000
Sometimes,
but I don't have any.

1198
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,700
I could go run out
and get you some.

1199
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,000
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
No, don't go.

1200
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,500
God.

1201
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,700
Do you think

1202
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,100
I'm some sad-sack,
middle-aged lesbian?

1203
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:46,100
You know, I have been trying
to come up with a way to
describe you to my friends,

1204
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,600
and now I finally have it.
Thank you so much.

1205
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,800
(PHONE RINGING)

1206
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,100
(LAUGHING)
Fuck you.

1207
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,500
You want to get that?

1208
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,300
No, no. I want
to get some of this.

(BEEPING)

1210
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,600
Paul, it's Joni.

1211
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,900
I just wanted to call you
and apologize for
my friend Sasha.

1212
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,300
You know, when you put
your hands on her shoulders,

1213
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,900
I think that
she thought that...

1214
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,700
Hey, Joni. It's Paul.
(MOUTHING) Don't get that.

1215
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,700
Listen, I'm really sorry
about Sasha the other night.

1216
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,200
No, I didn't even...
No, no. No... Really,
I didn't even notice that.

1217
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,200
I hope you didn't
feel uncomfortable.

1218
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,000
No, not at all. I...
(STUTTERING)

1219
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,900
Not at all.

1220
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Okay, sure.
Well, as long as...
Hold on, hold on.

1221
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,200
(WHISPERING)
Wait, wait, wait.

1222
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,700
No, just get off me.

1223
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,000
I'm just gonna...
Give me one second.

1224
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,900
Get off.

1225
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Jone?

1226
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,400
Oh, is my mom there?

1227
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,600
Your mom?
No, no. She split.

1228
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,900
She went on
a Home Depot run.

1229
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,600
Did you go to Home Depot?

1230
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,700
Yeah. J ust got back.

1231
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,500
That was fast.

1232
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,200
Yeah, no lines.

1233
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,400
What's that look
you're giving me?

1234
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
What look?

1235
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,100
The look that you're
giving me right now.

1236
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,000
No. That's no look.
That's just my face.

1237
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:13,300
Yeah,
I'm not gonna play
this game with you.

1238
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,800
You know, you can
keep your judgments
to yourself.

1239
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,100
No. I didn't give
no looks, seora.

1240
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,700
I don't ask
why you blow your nose
all the time.

1241
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,900
If you have a drug problem,
then that's your business.

1242
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,600
No, I don't have
no drug problem.

1243
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:26,700
I have allergies.

1244
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,500
Then why are
you a gardener?

1245
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,700
'Cause I love
the flowers.

Man, this is
not gonna work.

You know, I'm gonna pay you
through the end of the day,

1248
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,100
and then we're through. Okay?

(SPEAKS SPANISH)

1250
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,600
Thank you very much.

1251
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,400
Thanks. Thank you.

1252
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,600
Can we talk about...

1253
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,800
No, we can't.

1254
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,500
LUIS: A little bit.
You know why?

1255
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,000
'Cause there's nothing
to talk about.

1256
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,900
I think you know.

1257
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,900
You know.

1258
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,800
Look.

1259
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,200
I know you've all
been enjoying
your time with Paul.

1260
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,200
And I know that I haven't
been as open to him
as everybody else,

1261
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,500
and that's caused some
friction between us.

1262
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,400
But I'd like to try
and change that, okay?

1263
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,400
So I was thinking

1264
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,600
it might be nice if
we all had dinner at
his house sometime.

1265
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,000
Now that way,
I could get to know him
a little bit better,

1266
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,900
and I could see all
the good work that Mom's
been doing in the backyard.

1267
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,900
What do you think? Yeah?
Sure.

1268
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,100
NIC: Yeah.
Sure.

1269
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,200
Yeah?

1270

JONI: Yeah.

1271
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,600
Great.

1272
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,000
It's not...
I'm not done yet.

1273
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,200
You know,
I'm not, you know...

1274
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,400
No. No, I know.

1275
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,400
I haven't done all
the planting or anything.

1276
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,900
But I wanna see
the process.

1277
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,200
You know, like other colors,
other than green colors.

1278
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,100
Well, that's okay.
I just wanna see
the process.

1279
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,700
Great.

Need a hand?

1283
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,500
Hold on.
Let me help you.

1284
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,600
Ready? Okay.

1285
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,000
Right here.

1286
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,500
Yeah.

1287
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,600
We can't be doing this.

1288
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,300
I know. This is...

1289

I'm married.

1290
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,100

Yeah, and I love Nic, so...

1292
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,100
Hey.
I don't...

1293
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,700
It was fun while it lasted.

1294
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,700
Sorry.

1295
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,800
I bought you
some cigarettes.

1296
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:30,700
Jesus. What is
wrong with me?

1297
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,600
I shouldn't have
fired Luis like that.
That was so wrong.

1298
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,800
Yeah, I think you're
being hard on yourself.

1299
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,300
You know, I mean,
things just get messed up
sometimes.

1300
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,600
No, no, that wasn't messy.
That was fucked up.

1301
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,100
I am so fucked up.

1302
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,800
I...

1303
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,000
I think
I'm falling for you.

1304
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,400
Oh, God, Paul.

1305
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,200
Don't.

1306
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,900
Tonight was
a really good night.

1307
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yeah.

1308
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,600
That one table had, like,
five bottles of wine.

1309
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,600
It was crazy.
It was a big night.

1310
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,500
You know,
Joni's really pretty.

1311
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,000
I think she's got
some of your genes.

1312
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,700
You think? I think
she looks more like
her mom, but thanks.

1313
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,000
I appreciate that.

1314
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,100
It was really cute
seeing you in Dad mode.

1315
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,500
Yeah?

1316
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,500
Yeah.

1317
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
It made me want
to fuck you.

1318
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,800
Yeah?

1319
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,000
Yeah.

1320
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:04,700
You know, I've been
missing our sleepovers.

1321
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,100
Yeah, we haven't
been doing that in
a while, have we?

1322
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,800
Mmm-mmm.

1323
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,700
You want to meet up later?

1324
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,300
(SIGHING) Tanya,

1325
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,800
you're so sexy
and beautiful, but I...

1326
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,200
I don't think
we should do
that anymore.

1327
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,400
You know,
what we have is
really fun and easy,

1328
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:33,500
but I don't want to be that,
like, 50-year-old guy who's
just hanging out, you know?

1329
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,500
I really do want
to have a family,

1330
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:40,200
and I need to be doing that
with someone who's, like,
ready to go there with me.

1331
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,100
Oh.

1332
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,100
Okay.

1333
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,400
Tanya.

1334
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,800
Yeah? Fuck you.

1335
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,800
It's locked.

1336
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,300
Yeah, I mean,
obviously I have
more to do down here.

1337
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,800
I gotta fill it in,
but this is the general idea.

1338
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,400
No, it looks great.

1339
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,500
Yeah?

1340
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,700
It's so indigenous.

1341
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,400
Really.
I am so proud of you.

1342
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,400
Yeah, you like it?
Yeah?

1343
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,100
I'm so proud.

1344
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,200
I love you, honey.

1345
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,100
I love you, too.

1346
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,200
I'm so glad you like it.
It's incredible.

1347
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,300
Oh, man.

1348
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,300
And now, wait,
how's that guy Luis
working out?

1349
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,500
Man, I had to fire him.

1350
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,600
Oh, my God.

1351
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,300
Yeah, he has
a drug problem.

1352
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,500
You're kidding!
What drug?

1353
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,700
No. I know... I...

1354
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,900
Blow, I think.

1355
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,400
You're a natural, kid.

1358
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,500
You're a natural.

too much olive oil.

you're just gonna love.

1363
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,400
You know what? I think
I'm gonna stick with water,
but thank you so much.

1364
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,100
You sure?
Yeah.

1365
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,300

1366
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,600
NIC: Paul, this steak
is delicious.

1367
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,800
PAUL: Thank you.

1368
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,600
Really, it's...
What is the seasoning?

1369
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:04,900
Guys, we just misted it
with a little truffle oil,
right?

1370
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Mmm-hmm.

1371
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,400
PAUL: It's so easy.
NIC: Wow.

1372
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,200
What a good idea.
We ought to try that.
Right, honey?

1373
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,300
Mmm-hmm.

1374
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,100
And it's done
to perfection.

1375
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Yeah?
It's not too rare?

1376
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,400
Oh, no, no.

1377
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,900
It's juicy and tender.
Exactly what rare's
supposed to be.

1378
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,200
Right? I mean, I got people
coming into the restaurant,

1379
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,000
they see the slightest
bit of red, they just
start freaking out.

1380
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,900
(SCOFFING)
Isn't that annoying?

1381
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,100
That happens to me
all the time
when I'm grilling.

1382
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,400
PAUL: Hey, red is rare.

1383
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,000
Hello, it's bloody.

1384
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,600
I mean...
Hello?

1385
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,000
Yoo-hoo.
Hello, thank you.

1386
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah, I mean,
if you're in Argentina,
and you ask for rare,

1387
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:40,200
they bring you a cow
still mooing on the plate.

1388
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,300
(LAUGHING)

1389
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,800
I really want to go
to Argentina. Buenos Aires
is supposed to be...

1390
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:47,200
Hey. I noticed
your record collection
over there.

1391
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,000
Wow, it's quite an
eclectic mix, you know.

1392
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,800
Thank you very much, N ic.

1393
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,200
You're welcome.

1394
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,600
You don't meet
too many straight guys
who love Joni Mitchell.

1395
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,500
You sure don't.

1396
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,000
You like Joni?

1397
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,300
No, not really.
We just named our
daughter after her.

1398
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,500
Really?
Oh, shut the front door.

1399
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,800
Come on. Really?
You never told me you
were named after Joni M.

1400
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,500
It's so dorky.
I don't like to
bring it up.

1401
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,700
That is so cool.

1402
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,600
No, what's your
favorite Joni album?
It's not cool.

1403
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
Blue.

1404
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,500
Right? My brother
from another mother.

1405
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,600
Oh, my God.
I mean...

1406
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:28,300
Listen, I spent half
of high school in my room
crying to that album.

1407
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,400
That record,
it kills me.

1408
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,000
It doesn't stop.
No.

1409

I want to shampoo you

1423
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,500
I want to renew you
again and again

Life is our cause

When I think of your kisses

1427
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,600
My mind see-saws

1428
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,500

do you see

Do you see, do you see

Do you see how
you hurt me, baby

1431
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,300
And I hurt you, too

1432
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,400
That's why we both get

1433
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:45,100
so blue

1434
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,000

1435

Don't quit your
day job, Mom.

hard enough to open your
heart in this world.

1437
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,800
Don't make it any harder.

1438
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,000
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was a wonderful rendition.

1439
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,500
Beautiful, thank you.

1440
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,800
I like this guy.

1441
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,300
PAUL: Why, thank you, N ic.

1442
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,400
Okay. Paul,
where's your bathroom?

1443
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,400
It's just right here
around the corner.

1444
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,800
All right. Thanks.

1445
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:27,400
And you know what?
I am gonna have a glass
of the Alma Rosa, okay?

1446
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,800
All right.

1447
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,700

really love Argentina.

JONI: I really
wanna go there.

01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,800
PAUL: Buenos Aires
is literally, like,

1450
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,000
one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.

in the Grand Canyon.

1453
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,000
JONI: Can we go?
I'll take you.

1454
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,500
PAUL: A big rattlesnake
when I was in the desert
in Baja, Mexico.

1455
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,100
We should.
I'll take you to Baja.

1456
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,200
I was in the desert and...

1457
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,500
JONI: What's it like there?

1458
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,300
PAUL: It's beautiful.

1459
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,700
I was surfing, but then
there was no waves,

1460
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,400
so we climbed up
into the mountains.

1461
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,700
And I hear a rattling,
and it was a rattlesnake.

1462
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,800
And so I was scrambling.
I didn't know what to do,

1463
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:27,200
so I reached out for
a rock, and then I threw it
at the rattlesnake...

some time up there?

with him, aren't you?

with me, okay?

than I feel right now.

in his drain.

Because...

1481
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,800
Because I was working,
and I got dirty,
and I took a shower.

No. It has nothing
to do with that!

I've just felt so far away
from you lately.

1488
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,400
Oh, right.
So it's my fault?

1489

anything about fault?

about what happened?

want to talk to you.

I know that
you and Joni heard
what was going on,

01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:53,500
and I wanted to tell you
that what happened

that I'm here if you ever
want to talk about anything.

you want to talk about?

Oh, no.

1535
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,500
What happened?

1536
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,700
With my mom?

just come and talk to you,

Joni, listen to me. Please...

1541
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,400
Don't call me again.

Hey, Paul,
look at these cukes.
Aren't they awesome?

No.

I just talked to Joni.

What happened?
What's going on?

1549

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Hey, you know what?

1555
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I just say we go for it.
I mean, it's all out
in the open now.

1556
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,900
I mean,
let's just do this thing.

Paul...

1558
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,300
I don't care what you say,
Jules. We can...

1559
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,400
This can work, you know.
This isn't a mistake.

for no reason.

the kids together.

1563

I'm sick of this life.

I'm ready.

You don't wanna get sick.

I'm fine.

Are you gonna
talk to him?

Yeah.

It's sexy.

We're in the middle
of a conversation.

That's okay.

take some Advil.

you should know.

could ever happen?

the other person.

weird projections
of your own junk.

to each other,
you go off the rails

01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,600
Give us some credit.

1705
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,200
It's gonna be weird
not having you
around anymore.

1706
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:51,200
Sorry to leave you
alone with them.

1707
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,200
It'll be okay.

1708
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,900
(NIC AND JULES CRYING)

1709
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,800
Hey, guys, come on.

1710
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,400
Hey, it's okay.
I'll speak to you
soon, okay?

1711
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,100
Okay.

1712
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I don't think you guys
should break up.

1713
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,000
No? Why's that?

1714
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,900
I think you're too old.

1715
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,500
NIC: Thanks, Laser.
