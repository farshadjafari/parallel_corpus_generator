1
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:11,945
This is what I get in return for 30 years
of service for my company?

2
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:14,959
And they send some yo-yo like you
in here,

3
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,464
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?

4
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,800
They should be telling you
you're out of a job.

5
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:23,810
You have a lot of gall, coming in here
and firing your No.1 producer.

6
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:27,188
You're going to go home and make
more money than you've ever made in your life

7
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,542
and I'm going to go home
without a pay cheque. Fuck you.

8
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:33,634
I guess you leave me dumbfounded.
I don't know where this is coming from.

9
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,026
How am I meant to go back as a man
and explain to my wife I lost my job?

10
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,440
On a stress level, I've heard that
losing your job is like a death in the family.

11
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:48,920
But personally,
I feel more like

12
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,352
the people I worked with
were my family and I died.

13
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:55,912
I can't afford to be unemployed.

14
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:58,780
I have a house payment,
I have children.

15
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,172
I don't know how you can live
with yourself,

16
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:04,716
but I'm sure that you'll find a way
while the rest of us are suffering.

17
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:07,320
Who the fuck are you, man?

18
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,121
<i>Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?</i>

19
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,458
<i>Poor Steve has worked here
for seven years.</i>

20
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,753
<i>He's never had a meeting with me
before or passed me in the hall,</i>

21
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,976
<i>or told me a story in the break room.</i>

22
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,558
<i>That's because I don't work here.</i>

23
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:24,952
<i>I work for another company that lends
me out to pussies like Steve's boss</i>

24
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:27,504
<i>who don't have the balls
to sack their own employees,</i>

25
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,810
<i>in some cases for good reason.
People do crazy shit when they get fired.</i>

26
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,061
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:41,478
I mean, is there something
I could do differently here?

28
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:46,866
This is not an assessment of your
productivity. Don't take this personally.

29
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:48,896
Don't take it personally.

30
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:51,757
Steven, I want you to review this packet.

31
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:55,660
Take it seriously. I think you're gonna
find a lot of good answers in here.

32
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:58,084
I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful -
a packet.

33
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,750
Thank you... A packet.

34
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:09,799
Well, anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world sat where you are right now.

35
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,165
And it's because they sat there
they were able to do it.

36
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:15,406
That's the truth.

37
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:23,578
I'm gonna need your keycard.

38
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:26,912
Great. OK.

39
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:32,159
Now, I want you to take the day, go get
together your personal things, then tomorrow

40
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:35,394
you get yourself some exercise.
You go out for a jog,

41
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,774
you give yourself some routines
and pretty soon you find your legs.

42
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,844
How do I get in touch with you?
- Don't worry, we'll be in touch soon.

43
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,526
This is just the beginning.

44
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:49,728
<i>I'll never see Steve again.</i>

45
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:12,886
<i>To know me is to fly with me.
This is where I live.</i>

46
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,954
<i>When I run my card,</i>

47
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,876
<i>the system automatically prompts the desk clerk
to greet me with this exact statement:</i>

48
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,752
Pleasure to see you again,
Mr Bingham.

49
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:28,282
<i>It's these kinds of systemised friendly
touches that keep my world in orbit.</i>

50
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,752
<i>All the things you probably hate
about travelling -</i>

51
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:09,828
<i>the recycled air, the artificial lighting,
the digital juice dispensers,</i>

52
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:14,646
<i>the cheap sushi -
are warm reminders that I'm home.</i>

53
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,428
Do you want the cancer?

54
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,058
The what?
- Do you want the cancer?

55
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,058
The cancer?

56
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:42,086
The can...sir?
- Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

57
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,420
How much does your life weigh?

58
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:10,158
Imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

59
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:15,672
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders. Feel 'em?

60
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,444
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

61
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,292
Start with the little things,

62
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:25,723
the things on shelves and in drawers
the knick-knacks, the collectibles.

63
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,141
Feel the weight as that adds up.

64
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:34,534
Then you start adding larger stuff -
clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens...

65
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,728
your TV...

66
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:40,444
The backpack should be getting
pretty heavy now. And you go bigger.

67
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,708
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table.
Stuff it all in there.

68
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,841
Your car, get it in there.

69
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:51,338
Your home, whether it's
a studio apartment or a two-bedroomed house.

70
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:55,542
I want you to stuff it all
into that backpack.

71
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,134
Now try to walk.

72
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,934
It's kind of hard, isn't it?

73
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:05,094
This is what we do to ourselves
on a daily basis

74
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,993
We weigh ourselves down until we can't
even move. And make no mistake...

75
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:11,957
moving is living.

76
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:16,340
Now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire.
What do you want to take out of it?

77
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:18,111
Photos?

78
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:22,874
Photos are for people who can't remember.
Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn.

79
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:29,631
In fact, let everything burn
and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing.

80
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:33,660
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?

81
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,996
Welcome back, Mr Bingham.

82
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,636
Ryan Bingham's office.
- You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.

83
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,283
They were out of all full-size sedans.
- Did you try...

84
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,826
Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable
No.1 Gold Club status in years in the program.

85
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:05,977
They are literally moving mountains
to see you in a Sebring.

86
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,376
Fair enough. Any other messages?
- Er...your sister Kara called.

87
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,898
Needs to speak urgently
about your sister's wedding.

88
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:15,036
I told her you were mid-air,
and not even I knew your destination.

89
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:19,996
Well done. - You got an invitation
to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas.

90
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,082
GoalQuest 20?

91
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:26,972
<i>Every once in a while, I do speaking engagements,
motivational stuff. But GoalQuest?</i>

92
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:29,474
<i>We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.</i>

93
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,153
It's got a hologram on it.
They're calling it Dos Equis.

94
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,616
All right, I'll check in.
- I've got Craig Gregory for you.

95
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,211
Wait...ah.
Fuck.

96
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,263
How is my little road warrior?

97
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:45,144
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding
into a world of bliss.

98
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,534
Real good numbers out of Phoenix,
Ry guy.

99
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,250
You know that Big Auto is about to cut
another 10K by the end of the month?

100
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,426
No kidding.
- Christmas came early.

101
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:56,980
I wish you could be in five places, but
I need you here in Omaha this week. Alright?

102
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:01,530
I thought you needed me everywhere.
- We got something real big, a real game changer.

103
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:03,034
What are we talking about here?

104
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,034
You'll see. Today I took my first crap
in two weeks - hallelujah.

105
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,322
That's me hanging up on you.
- Great, love that sound.

106
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:34,670
Are you satisfied with Maestro?

107
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,240
Yeah, I am.

108
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,590
A little stingy with their miles.
I like Hertz.

109
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:47,803
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.
If a car has over 20,000 miles, I won't drive it.

110
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:50,799
Maestro doesn't instant checkout.
I like the park-and-go.

111
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:55,453
Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.
- You don't seem like a girl who needs directions.

112
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:00,165
I hate asking for directions.
- That's why I get a nav.

113
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:05,389
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

114
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,398
Is that a joke?
- Yes.

115
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:11,884
Their kiosk placement blows.
- They never have available upgrades.

116
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,907
Basically, it's a fleet of shit boxes. I
don't know how they're still in business.

117
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:19,270
I'm Ryan.
- I'm Alex.

118
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:27,061
Aww...Maplewood card.
How dare you bring that into this palace?

119
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:31,060
Hilton offers equal value and better food but
the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check-in.

120
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:34,610
I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.

121
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:40,973
There's an industry term for that.
It's a mixture of faux and homey - faumey.

122
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,938
Oh, my God.
I wasn't sure this actually existed.

123
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:50,123
This is the American Airlines...
- It's a Concierge Key, yeah.

124
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:56,834
What is that, carbon fibre?
- Graphite.

125
00:12:56,931 --> 00:13:00,302
Oh, I love the weight. - I was pretty excited
the day that bad boy came in.

126
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:06,741
I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.
60 thou a year, domestic.

127
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:09,338
That's not bad.
- Don't patronise me.

128
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:11,754
What's your total?
- It's a personal question.

129
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,353
Pleace.
- And we hardly know each other.

130
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:17,669
Show some hubris.
Come on, impress me.

131
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,563
I bet it's huge.
- You have no idea.

132
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,981
How big?

133
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:27,327
What is it, this big? This big?
- I don't want to brag.

134
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:29,381
Oh, come on! Come on.

135
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:33,351
Let's just say I have a number in mind.
I haven't hit it yet.

136
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:41,044
This is pretty fucking sexy.
- Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.

137
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:45,606
We're two people who get turned on by Elite Status.
I think cheap is our starting point.

138
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:49,327
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.

139
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,662
We came up with this master plan,
which was for me...

140
00:13:56,748 --> 00:14:01,225
...to put gauze,
to put bandages on both my hands.

141
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:06,967
Then we got on the plane,
transatlantic, flying to erm...Zurich.

142
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:11,705
I waited till it was dark,
and I walked up to the bathroom with her.

143
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,514
Everybody was watching the movie and I was like...

144
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:20,041
Opened up, went inside. She opened the door for me,
and came in like she was gonna help me.

145
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:24,150
We gave it our best shot. It wasn't
great. But it was fun. It was tricky.

146
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:27,275
Give me some details.
- It's not so easy. Have you tried it?

147
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:30,357
It's not so easy.
- Yes, I have.

148
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,148
Really?
- Really.

149
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:41,089
You've done that?
- I have done that.

150
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:45,789
On a transatlantic flight?
- On a domestic flight - regional, actually.

151
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,944
At night-time?
- Daytime.

152
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,088
What?
- How do you do that?

153
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:54,513
Oh, I'm really flexible.

154
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:01,121
Look. Ohh.

155
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:07,953
Ah, I should throw these out.

156
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:13,314
We can always use that room
with the ice machine.

157
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,577
Look.

158
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,373
Good call on that towel rack.

159
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,806
I like how you burritoed me
in the sofa cushions.

160
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,635
I was improvising.

161
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:41,258
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.

162
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:44,938
We got to do this again.
- Oh, yeah.

163
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:53,750
I'm in Newark on the 12th,
Modesto on the 13th...

164
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,997
Oklahoma City on the 15th...

165
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,588
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by
Albuquerque week of the 16th.

166
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:02,710
No, I'm in Florida on the 20th.
- Fort Lauderdale?

167
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,593
Miami.
- That's nothing. - 40 minutes.

168
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,414
I should probably go back to my room
so I can wake up in my bed.

169
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,617
I think that would be
the ladylike thing to do.

170
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:34,401
Nice meeting you.
- A pleasure.

171
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,248
Hello?

172
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,916
<i>Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?</i>

173
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:14,559
<i>Every family has one person
who keeps the genealogy in check.</i>

174
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:17,342
<i>That's my sister Kara - the glue.</i>

175
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:20,023
Fine. You and the kids?

176
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,817
Missy's outstanding,
Matthew made varsity. How's the road?

177
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:24,915
Couldn't be better.

178
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,994
<i>Good. So, Ryan?</i>

179
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,411
Yeah?

180
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:33,521
I didn't even want to ask you this, because I know
how you are about doing things for others.

181
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:37,911
But we're coming up on three weeks to go to
Julie's wedding and we could really use your help.

182
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:39,121
Yeah?

183
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:40,929
<i>We've been sending people these kits,</i>

184
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:43,677
<i>so they can print out photos
of Julie and Jim on cardbord,</i>

185
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:48,003
and then take photos of them in interesting places,
like that gnome in the French movie.

186
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:49,792
Why?

187
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:53,509
Because it's Julie's wedding and she thinks
it would be fun. Does it matter why?

188
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:54,709
How is Julie?

189
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,801
<i>Would you call her.
She thinks you've turned to butter.</i>

190
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:00,839
You're awfully isolated how you live.
- Isolated? I'm surrounded.

191
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,267
<i>So your assistant said
you were gonna be in Vegas.</i>

192
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:04,413
Did he?

193
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:08,342
Can you get a photo of the cut-out
in front of the Luxor pyramid?

194
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:11,104
The place is a shithole.
Nobody stays there.

195
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,363
Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in.
Can you just take a stupid photo?

196
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,067
I'll try my best.

197
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:21,772
<i>Thank you for trying your best.</i>

198
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:43,019
<i>Last year,
I spent 322 days on the road,</i>

199
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:47,730
<i>which means I had to spend
43 miserable days at home.</i>

200
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:13,076
Hey, neighbour.

201
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:20,157
I signed for this while you were gone.
- Oh, thanks.

202
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:24,097
I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.
- Nah.

203
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,148
It's my sister. I haven't met the guy yet.
They're getting married.

204
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,353
Lots of luck.
- I know, right?

205
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:39,988
What are you doing tonight?
You wanna come over later?

206
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:44,280
Um...I've started seeing somebody.

207
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:47,637
Oh. OK. Great.

208
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,571
Hey, it's good to see you.

209
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:54,407
You too.
- It seems like it's been a while this time.

210
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,965
I'm thrilled that everyone's back
under one roof. Welcome home, boy's.

211
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:19,015
There's been a lot of whispering about
why we're here, so let me jump right in.

212
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:22,611
Retailers are down 20%.

213
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:27,267
Auto industry is in the dump.
Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.

214
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:31,704
It is one of the worst times on record
for America.

215
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:35,257
This is our moment.

216
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:40,565
Now, last summer, we received
a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.

217
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:44,477
And she had some pretty big ideas
that she challenged me with.

218
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:46,887
My first reaction was,
"Who does this kid think she is?"

219
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:49,719
But after I gave it a listen,
she really knocked me out. So...

220
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:54,610
With a peek into our future,
Natalie Keener.

221
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:00,967
If there's one word I want to
leave you with today, it's this.

222
00:21:02,356 --> 00:21:04,715
Glocal?

223
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,760
Glocal.

224
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:11,084
Our global must become local.

225
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,722
This company keeps 23 people
on the road at least 250 days a year.

226
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,778
It's expensive and it's inefficient

227
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:22,325
When I came to Craig
three months ago with this,

228
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:27,313
he told me, and quite astutely, it's only
a problem if you have a solution.

229
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:31,029
Well, today I stand before you
with just that.

230
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:36,462
You all know Ned in reception.
Today I'm gonna fire Ned.

231
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:40,133
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR
will hire you back this afternoon.

232
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,532
We'll see about that.

233
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:47,243
Ned could be any employee in any one
of our clients' locations worldwide.

234
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:49,323
Strategy packets
will be shipped in advance.

235
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,821
Ned will be given a seat and find one
of our transition specialists waiting.

236
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:55,624
Mr Laskin,

237
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,465
we're having this conversation
as your position is no longer available.

238
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,710
<i>I don't understand. I'm fired?</i>

239
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:04,007
Hearing the words
"You've been let go" is never easy.

240
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:06,745
Change is scary,
but consider the following:

241
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:10,453
anybody who ever built an empire or
changed the world sat where you are now.

242
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,945
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

243
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:15,222
That's my fucking line.

244
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:17,238
<i>But what happens now?</i>

245
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:20,993
This is the first step of a process that
ends with you in a job that fulfils you.

246
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,544
<i>Yeah, but how does it work?</i>

247
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,629
Take the packet in front of you.

248
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:27,909
Review it - all the answers
you're looking for are inside.

249
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:32,316
Fill out the necessary information and
you're on the way to new opportunities.

250
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:36,500
Ned, go back to your desk
and start putting together your things.

251
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:40,507
As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread the news just yet.

252
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,379
Panic doesn't help anyone.

253
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:45,019
<i>I understand.</i>

254
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:47,598
Give it up for Ned.

255
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:55,110
You can start the morning in Boston,
stop in Dallas over lunch,

256
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:59,327
and finish the day in San Francisco.
All for the price of a T1 line.

257
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:02,697
Our inflated travel budget
is eviscerated by 85%.

258
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:06,488
And more importantly,
to you guys on the road,

259
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:11,124
no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa,
no more hours lost to weather delays.

260
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,394
You get to come home.

261
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:18,772
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.

262
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:20,995
That's why I brought the entire company in
from the road,

263
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,612
because we're not taking it seriously.

264
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:25,860
There is a methodology to what I do,
a reason it works.

265
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,646
Coke and IBM have been doing this
for years. Familiar with them?

266
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:34,520
Like anything else, it'll take a few months
of transition and everybody will settle in.

267
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:36,964
Who are you taking off the road?
- How are you not getting this?

268
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,337
You are grouned.
Everybody's grounded. It's done.

269
00:23:40,423 --> 00:23:43,959
What we do here is brutal
and it does leave people devastated.

270
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:46,515
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.

271
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:49,729
By stabbing them in the chest
instead of the back, right?

272
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:52,151
You wanted to see me?
- Well, uhm...

273
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:55,574
You know what? Yeah, come on in.
- Great job out there.

274
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,981
Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
- Great.

275
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:04,780
Listen, I admire your...zeal.
And I think you have some very good ideas.

276
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:08,173
But you know nothing
about the realities of my industry.

277
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,963
You can set up an iChat,
but you don't know how people think.

278
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,604
I minored in psychology.
- Nice.

279
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,698
OK, kiddo, fire me.
- Ryan...

280
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:22,796
If she's gonna do this regularly, don't
you wanna know if she can fire people?

281
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:25,421
She's fired Ned.
- My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.

282
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:29,333
You don't need to do this.
- No, it's OK. I got this.

283
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,829
Mr Bingham,

284
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:36,146
I regret to inform you that your position
at this company is no longer available.

285
00:24:36,232 --> 00:24:37,248
Hm. Who the hell are you?

286
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:39,913
My name is Miss Keener. I'm here
today to discuss your future.

287
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,495
My future? The only one who can fire me
is Craig Gregory.

288
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,433
He hired me to handle this for him.
- Handle what? Handle Me?

289
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,291
Mr. Gregory hired me,
he's the only one who can fire me.

290
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:51,793
Know what? I'm gonna go talk to him.
- Mr Bingham...

291
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:54,569
No, no. You can't follow me.
You're on a computer screen, remember?

292
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:56,938
Ryan..
- Let's try this again. Fire me again.

293
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:59,197
I just did.
- Actually, you didn't. Fire me.

294
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:00,885
That's enough. We get it.

295
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:05,315
Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you
your position is no longer available.

296
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,588
I'm fired?
- Yes, you're fired.

297
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,695
Never say fired.
- You've been let go.

298
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,191
Why?

299
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,652
This is a mythical situation.
How could I possibly know why?

300
00:25:13,738 --> 00:25:15,972
Why doesn't matter,
you never know why.

301
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:19,821
Don't focus on the why. Rather, spend
your energy thinking about your future.

302
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:22,533
Well, I'm gonna spend
my energy on suing you

303
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:24,290
unless you give me a good
reason why you're firing me.

304
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:26,013
Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important.

305
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,837
You're firing me without grounds?
I have a lawsuit.

306
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:32,077
I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.
- Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.

307
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,511
Personally?

308
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:36,410
This is the most personal situation
you are ever gonna enter,

309
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:39,157
so before you try to revolutionise my business,

310
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:43,599
I'd like to know
that you actually know my business.

311
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:55,740
That's a hell of a way
to welcome her to the team.

312
00:25:56,449 --> 00:26:00,037
Am I the only one that sees that by doing
this we're making ourselves irrelevant?

313
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,613
No, frankly,
we're making you irrelevant.

314
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,491
Nice.
- Don't blame me.

315
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:07,901
Blame high fuel costs, blame insurance
premiums, blame technology.

316
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:11,424
Watch it. You're a little too young
to become a dinosaur.

317
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,121
I'm not a dinosaur.
- I want you to show her the ropes.

318
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:18,425
What do I know what goes on here?
Get Ferguson to do it.

319
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:20,993
I'm not talking about here.

320
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:24,551
No.
- Yeah.

321
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:27,471
You're very confident
this girl doesn't know what she's doing. So...

322
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:31,306
I'm sorry. I don't think a MySpace page
qualifies you to rewire a company.

323
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:35,191
Here's your chance. Go out, show her
the magic, take her through the paces.

324
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:38,065
I'm not a fucking tour guide.

325
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:44,294
Now here we go.
- Bingham, here's the boat.

326
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,426
And here's you.,
Do you want to be in the boat?

327
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,909
Yeah, alone.

328
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:53,815
We're ringing the bell,
we're rounding everybody up.

329
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:57,628
You want to stay out a bit longer, you're
welcome, but you will not be alone. Oké?

330
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:00,733
You let me know.

331
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:18,540
Oh, Christ.

332
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,386
What?
- Follow me.

333
00:28:14,617 --> 00:28:17,719
I really like my luggage.
That's exactly what it is - luggage.

334
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,690
Know how much time you lose
checking in?

335
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:23,993
I don't know. Five...10 minutes?
- 35 minutes a flight.

336
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,115
I travel 270 days a year.
That's 157 hours.

337
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:33,615
That makes seven days.
Willing to throw away an entire week on that?

338
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:44,570
You don't need this.
Sorry, you don't need that.

339
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:47,656
You don't need that.
They have neck pillows on the plane.

340
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:52,942
This - they have better ones there.
I'll get rid of this.

341
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,918
I can just meet you at security.

342
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:59,247
Thank you.

343
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:04,142
Bingo - Asians.

344
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:07,957
You can't be serious.
- Never get behind people with infants.

345
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:10,711
I've never seen a stroller collapse
in less than 20 minutes.

346
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:13,873
Old people are worse.
They're littered with hidden metal

347
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:16,905
and they never appreciate
how little time they have left on earth.

348
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:21,863
Five words: randomly selected
for additional screening.

349
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:23,350
Asians, they pack light, travel efficiently,

350
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:27,909
and
they've got a thing for slip-on shoes.

351
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:30,071
That's racist.
- I'm like my mother, I stereotype. It's faster.

352
00:29:48,902 --> 00:29:51,827
<i>What in your backpack?
Ryan Bigham.</i>

353
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,365
Are you mad at your computer?

354
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:06,169
I type with purpose.

355
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:10,607
What is it that you're working on
so furiously?

356
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,132
I'm building a workflow
of firing techniques.

357
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:17,052
It's questions and responses,
actions and reactions.

358
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:19,680
A script taking you through the steps
of firing someone.

359
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:21,332
Who's it for?

360
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:23,577
Well, theoretically,

361
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:26,810
you could put it in the hands
of anyone and they'd be downsizing immediately.

362
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:29,492
All you have to do is follow the steps.

363
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,067
Natalie,
what is it you think we do here?

364
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,464
We prepare the newly-unemployed for
the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting,

365
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,136
while minimising legal blowback.

366
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:40,853
That's what we're selling.
It's not what we're doing.

367
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:45,462
OK, what are we doing?
- We are here to make limbo tolerable,

368
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:54,048
to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread
until the point where hope is dimly visible.

369
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:59,676
Then stop the boat, shove 'em
in the water and make 'em swim.

370
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:03,972
That's really impressive.
Are you gonna put that in your book?

371
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:18,524
I gotta grab this.
I'll meet you at the car rental.

372
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,340
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

373
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:23,506
I'm in Hotlanta and I need
a rib-joint recommend bad.

374
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:26,060
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

375
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:29,897
You never called.
- I wasn't sure what was appropriate.

376
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:33,832
Appropriate? I'm not some waitress
you banged in a snowstorm.

377
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:37,316
<i>That word has no place
in our vocabulary.</i>

378
00:31:37,402 --> 00:31:41,081
I'm the woman that you don't have
to worry about.

379
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:44,973
Sounds like a trap.
- Listen...

380
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:47,765
the next time that you're worried
about manners, don't.

381
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:53,377
If you wanna call, call.
Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.

382
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,830
When am I gonna see you?

383
00:31:55,916 --> 00:32:02,153
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD,
with a connection in ORD into SDF.

384
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,630
<i>Sorry.</i>

385
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:05,683
Yeah, tell me about it.

386
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:10,830
How long's your layover? They got
multiples into SDF. Could you push?

387
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:14,842
Yeah, I can push.

388
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:29,894
All you have to do today
is watch and listen.

389
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,297
And when I talk about a strategy
packet, hand them one of those.

390
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:35,655
Sounds great.

391
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:39,043
So although I wish I were here
with better news,

392
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:43,096
the fact is that you and I are
sitting here today because

393
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:46,662
this will be your last week
of employment at this company.

394
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:48,710
Why me?
- What am I supposed to do now?

395
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:52,010
Am I supposed to feel better
I'm not the only one losing my job?

396
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:56,259
This is ridiculous!
I have been a fine employee for over 10 years

397
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:58,953
and this is the way you treat me.

398
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,255
How do you sleep at night, man?
How?

399
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:05,023
How's your family?
They sleeping well at night?

400
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,199
Electricity still on?

401
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,914
Heat still on, refrigerator full of food?

402
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,321
Gas tank full of gas?

403
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,580
Going to Chuck E. Cheese
this weekend or something?

404
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:17,726
Not me.

405
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,222
No, my kids,
we're not gonna do anything.

406
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:28,134
What do you suggest I tell them?

407
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:34,706
Perhaps you're underestimating
the positive effect

408
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:37,744
your career transition
can have on your children.

409
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,860
The positive effect?

410
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:44,151
I make about 90 grand a year now.

411
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:47,463
Unemployment is what -
250 bucks a week?

412
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,863
Is that one of your positive effects?

413
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:53,544
We'll get to be cosier cos I'm not gonna
be able to pay my mortgage on my house.

414
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,346
So maybe we can move into a nice
fucking one-bedroom apartment somewhere.

415
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,691
And I guess without benefits,

416
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:05,698
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she,
you know, suffers from her asthma

417
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:08,834
that I won't be able to afford
the medication for.

418
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,750
Well...tests have shown that children under
moderate trauma have a tendency to

419
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:16,660
apply themselves academically...

420
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,686
..as a method of coping.

421
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,806
Go fuck yourself.

422
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,407
That's what my kids'll think.

423
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:29,761
Your children's admiration is important to you?
- Yeah.

424
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:32,516
Yeah, it was.

425
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:34,816
Well, I doubt they ever admired you,
Bob.

426
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:38,829
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed
to be consoling me?

427
00:34:38,915 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm not a shrink, Bob.
I'm a wake-up call.

428
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:45,661
You know why kids love athletes?
- Cos they screw lingerie models?

429
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:49,925
No, that's why we love athletes.
Kids love athletes

430
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:52,472
because they follow their dreams.

431
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,570
Well, I can't dunk.
- No, but you can cook.

432
00:34:57,656 --> 00:34:59,283
What are you talking about?

433
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:03,856
Your résumé says that you minored
in French culinary arts.

434
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,737
Most students,
they work on the fryer at KFC,

435
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:10,169
but you bussed tables
at Il Picador to support yourself.

436
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:13,977
Then you get out of college
and then you come and work here.

437
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:17,619
How much did they first pay you
to give up on your dreams?

438
00:35:17,705 --> 00:35:21,257
27 grand a year.
- And when were you going to stop

439
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:24,940
and come back
and do what makes you happy?

440
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:27,669
Good question.

441
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:31,558
I see guys who work at the same
company for their entire lives,

442
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:33,595
guys exactly like you.

443
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:39,036
They clock in, they clock out,
and they never have a moment of happiness.

444
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:43,410
You have an opportunity here, Bob.

445
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,828
This is a rebirth.

446
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:50,027
If not for you, do it for your children.

447
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,761
He just waltzes in and cuts in line?

448
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:24,647
We reserve priority assistance
for our Hilton Honors members.

449
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:27,902
The promotions are great.
You should check it out.

450
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:35,195
Hungry much?

451
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:38,875
Our business expense
allots $40 each for dinner.

452
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:41,632
I plan on grabbing
as many miles as I can.

453
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:45,324
OK, you gotta fill me in on the miles
thing. What is that about?

454
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:48,761
Are you talking about...
like frequent flyer miles?

455
00:36:48,847 --> 00:36:52,452
You really want to know?
- I'm dying to know.

456
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:57,689
I don't spend a nickel if I can help it
unless it somehow profits my mileage account.

457
00:36:57,775 --> 00:37:00,572
So what are you saving up for -
Hawaii, South of France?

458
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:04,403
It's not like that.
The miles are the goal.

459
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,257
That's it?

460
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:07,770
You're saving just to save?

461
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:10,634
Just say I have a number in mind
and I haven't hit it yet.

462
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,060
That's a little abstract.
What's the target?

463
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:18,652
I'd rather not.
- Is it a secret target?

464
00:37:19,107 --> 00:37:22,089
It's 10 million miles.

465
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:25,753
OK. Isn't 10 million just a number?
- Pi's just a number.

466
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,088
Well, we all need a hobby.

467
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:33,675
No, I... I don't mean to belittle your collection.
I get it. It sounds cool.

468
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:37,222
I'd be the seventh person to do it.
More people have walked on the moon.

469
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:41,723
Do they throw you a parade?
- You get lifetime executive status,

470
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,176
you get to meet the chief pilot,
Maynard Finch...

471
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,776
And they put your name on a plane.

472
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:48,791
Men get hard-ons putting their name on stuff.
You guy;s dont grow up.

473
00:37:48,877 --> 00:37:51,616
It's like you need to pee on everything.
- Now who's stereotyping?

474
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:55,854
Fear of mortality. It's like,
yeah, you're gonna die one day.

475
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,227
Why is that singular to men?

476
00:37:58,313 --> 00:38:02,622
Probably because you can't have babies.
- The baby argument.

477
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:08,523
If I had that many miles...

478
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:10,059
I would show up at an airport,

479
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:14,558
look at the destination board,
pick a place and go.

480
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,842
<i>Can't fall asleep.</i>

481
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,719
<i>Me too just laying here</i>

482
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:48,973
<i>You should rub one out.</i>

483
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:52,362
Thank you for the advice.

484
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:58,602
<i>Only fair if you do too</i>

485
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:09,224
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

486
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:19,080
<i>Call me next tim so I can listen</i>

487
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,280
<i>Have sweet dreams about me.</i>

488
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:38,156
OK. Closer.
Way closer.

489
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:41,199
Still closer.

490
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:44,214
Closer.

491
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:46,803
Er...a little left.

492
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,998
Down a little.

493
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:52,898
Too far. Up. Up one more inch.

494
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:56,264
I don't get it. Why does your sister
want a fake photo?

495
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,548
My sister is kooky. She thinks
this is charming. It's like the gnome thing.

496
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:03,855
No, I mean, why would she want a fake photo
in front of St Louis airport?

497
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:07,488
Are you kidding - Lambert Field?
The Wright brothers flew through there.

498
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,727
That domed main terminal,

499
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:13,936
is the first of its kind, a precursor
of everything from JFK to de Gaulle.

500
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:17,601
Pretty sweet.
- Just take the picture.

501
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:22,327
Well, that's a keeper.

502
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:24,538
Let me see it.

503
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:29,380
Why she wants reminders of all the
places she hasn't been is beyond me.

504
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:31,708
I'm sure she'll be crushed
for having missed this airport.

505
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:36,055
Before Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,
he took off from that runway.

506
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,064
Wonder why they called it
the Spirit of St Louis?

507
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,034
No.
- Well...

508
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:51,120
<i>Do you know how fucked
this place is now?</i>

509
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:53,430
I am the one thing - the one thing-

510
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:57,672
preventing this place
from being totally fucked in the ass.

511
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,580
Sometimes they just need to vent.

512
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:12,530
Please, for the love of God,
can I fire the next one?

513
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:16,722
Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.
- I'm here to be fired, right?

514
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,772
Well, we're here
to talk about your future.

515
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:22,325
You don't have to sugar-coat it.
I get the drill.

516
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:24,935
What are they offering?

517
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:27,628
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly
worked out severance package.

518
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:30,343
Give me the bullet points.

519
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:31,952
It's actually pretty good -

520
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:34,400
three months' pay, six months' medical.

521
00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:37,488
And a full year of placement services
through our CTC.

522
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:41,558
Placement services. That's generous.

523
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:47,404
Commonly it takes a month of searching
for every $10,000 you expect to earn in salary.

524
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,693
So I could be looking for a while.
- Not necessarily.

525
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:54,914
Don't even sweat it.
I'm pretty confident about my plans.

526
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,806
Really?
- Yeah.

527
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:00,174
There's this beautiful bridge
by my house.

528
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:03,598
I'm gonna go jump off it.

529
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:06,097
Natalie.

530
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:07,489
Hey!

531
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:09,708
Natalie!

532
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:21,448
People say these things all the time.
It's part of the trade.

533
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:23,976
They do?
- Yeah.

534
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:29,505
They say crazy things.
They get worked up.

535
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,241
She was really calm.

536
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:34,724
I think that's a good sign.

537
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:39,616
So they don't ever actually do it?
- No. No, it's just talk.

538
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:44,574
How do you know? Do you follow up?
- No, nothing good's gonna come of that, but..

539
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:48,532
I wouldn't worry about it.

540
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:56,022
This is what we do, Natalie. We take people
at their most fragile and we set them adrift.

541
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:02,420
Ready to go back in?

542
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:05,724
All right, let's go. Come on.

543
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:53,355
No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.

544
00:43:53,534 --> 00:43:57,770
I'll be back soon. I'm not sure how long
this exercise is supposed to last.

545
00:43:57,856 --> 00:44:01,814
No, I don't even think of him that way.
He's old.

546
00:44:41,705 --> 00:44:45,122
I- I'm done?
- I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.

547
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,212
Just like that?

548
00:44:46,298 --> 00:44:50,080
I'm disappointed that I've given
so much of my life...

549
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,226
This is not fair.

550
00:44:51,312 --> 00:44:53,795
There are people way more qualified
than me now.

551
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:57,568
I don't know what to do
when I wake up tomorrow.

552
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:06,332
You OK?

553
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:10,770
Are we going?
- Yeah.

554
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:31,280
<i>This is how I start every day of my life.</i>

555
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:36,289
Now, this is gonna be a little difficult,
so stay with me.

556
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,301
You have a new backpack.

557
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:42,025
Only this time,
I want you to fill it with people.

558
00:45:42,111 --> 00:45:45,880
Start with casual acquaintances,
friends of friends,

559
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:47,634
folks around the office.

560
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,102
And then the people you trust
with your most intimate secrets -

561
00:45:51,188 --> 00:45:53,621
your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,

562
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:57,451
your brothers, your sisters,
your parents,

563
00:45:57,537 --> 00:46:02,990
and finally your husband, your wife,
your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

564
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:06,632
You get them into that backpack.

565
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:11,812
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you
to light it on fire.

566
00:46:13,097 --> 00:46:15,249
Feel the weight of that bag.

567
00:46:15,335 --> 00:46:21,060
Make no mistake, your relationships are
the heaviest components in your life.

568
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:26,242
Do you feel the straps
cutting into your shoulders?

569
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:33,308
All those negotiations and arguments,
and secrets and compromises.

570
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:38,590
<i>You don't need to carry all that weight.</i>

571
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:41,877
<i>Why don't you set that bag down?</i>

572
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:49,337
Some animals were meant to carry each other,
to live symbiotically for a lifetime -

573
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:54,740
star-crossed lovers, monogamous swans.
We are not those animals.

574
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:58,716
The slower we move, the faster we die.

575
00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:02,496
We are not swans.

576
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,471
We're sharks.

577
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:20,743
<i>Never?
- No.</i>

578
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:22,933
Ever?
- No.

579
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:25,390
You never want to get married?
- Nope.

580
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,520
Never want kids?
- Not a chance.

581
00:47:27,606 --> 00:47:30,284
Ever?
- Never.

582
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,709
Is that so bizarre?
- Yes.

583
00:47:33,795 --> 00:47:38,063
Yes, it is.
- I just don't see the value in it.

584
00:47:38,477 --> 00:47:41,104
Right, sell it to me.
- What?

585
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,450
Sell me marriage.

586
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:48,248
OK, how about love?
- OK.

587
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:53,146
Stability, just somebody you can count on...
- How many stable marriages do you know?

588
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:56,506
Somebody to talk to,
someone to spend your life with.

589
00:47:56,592 --> 00:48:00,292
I'm surrounded by people to talk to.
That won't change.

590
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,832
How about just not dying alone?

591
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:08,306
Starting when I was 12, we moved each
of my grandparents to a nursing facility.

592
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:12,960
My parents went the same way.
Make no mistake, we all die alone.

593
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:17,842
Now, those cult members in San Diego,
with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers...

594
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,059
they didn't die alone.

595
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:22,806
I'm just saying there are options.

596
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:27,938
Oh, fuck.

597
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:31,270
Brian left me.

598
00:48:37,191 --> 00:48:39,628
All right.

599
00:48:41,443 --> 00:48:44,320
OK. Ok. All right.

600
00:48:45,557 --> 00:48:48,898
All right. Shh, shh.

601
00:49:01,562 --> 00:49:05,704
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend.
This is Natalie.

602
00:49:06,157 --> 00:49:08,461
I should give you both a moment.

603
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:13,864
No. No, that's fine.
I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.

604
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:18,308
Maybe we should just all
go up to our rooms and freshen up.

605
00:49:18,394 --> 00:49:20,778
Maybe a drink?
- Now you're talking.

606
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:23,598
<i>Brian: I think it's time we C othter people</i>

607
00:49:24,248 --> 00:49:26,576
He broke up with you
with a text message?

608
00:49:26,662 --> 00:49:30,128
Kind of like firing someone
over the internet.

609
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,204
What a weaselly prick.
- But what does that make me?

610
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:37,725
Someone who falls for a prick.
- We all fall for them.

611
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:40,620
Pricks are
spontaneous, unpredictable and fun.

612
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:43,698
Then we're surprised
when they turn out to be pricks.

613
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:48,150
I followed him to Omaha.
- You did?

614
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:52,868
I had a job waiting for me in San Francisco
when he got an offer from ConAgra.

615
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:56,404
He said we could start a life together.

616
00:49:56,963 --> 00:50:00,728
So I followed him.
- To Nebraska?

617
00:50:02,837 --> 00:50:06,074
I thought I'd be engaged by now.

618
00:50:06,315 --> 00:50:07,766
No offence.

619
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:10,096
None taken.
- That's all right.

620
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:14,894
When I was 16,
I thought by 23 I'd be married,

621
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,609
maybe have a kid, corner office by day,
entertaining at night.

622
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:21,866
I was supposed to be driving
a Grand Cherokee by now.

623
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:25,009
Life can underwhelm you that way.

624
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:28,396
I mean, where did you
think you'd be by um...

625
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:34,514
It doesn't work that way.
- At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.

626
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,061
It can be counterproductive.

627
00:50:36,147 --> 00:50:38,128
I don't want to say anything
anti-feminist.

628
00:50:38,214 --> 00:50:41,561
I really appreciate
all your generation did for me.

629
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:43,454
It was our pleasure.
- Well done.

630
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,366
But sometimes it feels like,
no matter how much success I have,

631
00:50:46,452 --> 00:50:49,464
it's not gonna matter
until I find the right guy.

632
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:52,657
You really thought
this guy was the one?

633
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:55,106
I could have made it work.

634
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:58,254
He um... He really fit the bill.

635
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,630
You know?
- The bill?

636
00:51:00,716 --> 00:51:03,199
White collar, college grad.

637
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:07,390
Loves dogs, likes funny movies.
Six-foot-one, brown hair, kind eyes,

638
00:51:07,476 --> 00:51:12,984
works in finance but is outdoorsy...
you know, on the weekends.

639
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:19,172
I always imagined he'd have a single
syllable name like Matt or John...

640
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:21,222
or Dave.

641
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:24,262
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner, and

642
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:27,348
and the only thing he loves
more than me is his golden lab.

643
00:51:27,888 --> 00:51:30,662
And a nice smile.

644
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:36,904
What about you?
- Let me think.

645
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:43,205
Honestly, by the time you're 34, all the
physical requirements go out the window.

646
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:47,044
Like you secretly pray
that he'll be taller than you.

647
00:51:47,943 --> 00:51:52,400
Not an asshole would be nice. Someone who
enjoys my company, comes from a good family.

648
00:51:52,486 --> 00:51:54,612
You don't think about that
when you're younger.

649
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:58,818
I don't know...
someone who wants kids.

650
00:51:58,904 --> 00:52:01,919
Likes kids. Wants kids

651
00:52:02,005 --> 00:52:05,962
Healthy enough to play with his kids.

652
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:11,113
Please let him earn more money
than I do.

653
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:14,274
You might not understand that now,
but believe me, you will one day.

654
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,530
Otherwise that's a recipe for disaster.

655
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:21,603
And hopefully some hair on his head.

656
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:25,504
But I mean even that's not
a deal breaker these days.

657
00:52:28,663 --> 00:52:31,010
A nice smile.

658
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:36,418
Yeah, a nice smile.
Nice smile just might do it.

659
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,134
Wow, that was depressing.

660
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:45,624
I should just date women.
- Tried it.

661
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:48,438
We're no picnic ourselves.

662
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:54,464
I don't mind being married
to my career.

663
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,388
And I don't expect it to hold me in bed
as I fall asleep.

664
00:53:02,439 --> 00:53:05,207
I just don't want to settle.

665
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:09,266
You're young. Right now you see
settling as some sort of a failure.

666
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:13,095
It is...by definition.

667
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:17,147
But by the time someone is right
for you, it won't feel like settling.

668
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:18,744
And the only person left to judge you

669
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,354
will be the 23-year-old girl
with a target on your back.

670
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:28,706
So what's the plan for the evening?

671
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:33,400
Well, we were gonna hit that party
for the tech conference at the hotel.

672
00:53:33,486 --> 00:53:37,206
I didn't know you could just attend
those. I thought you had to register.

673
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:40,070
Technically,
I don't think it's open to the public.

674
00:53:40,156 --> 00:53:44,582
Stop by.
- You're gonna crash it?

675
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:52,809
have a good time, usually.
- No, no, I get it. I'm in.

676
00:54:12,507 --> 00:54:14,811
Jennifer Chu?

677
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:17,931
Shit!
- Ah, it'll be fine.

678
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:41,991
Doing all right?

679
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:46,073
Yeah. This was a great idea.

680
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:49,765
You're so pretty.

681
00:54:50,048 --> 00:54:53,670
You're exactly
what I wanna look like in 15 years.

682
00:54:53,945 --> 00:54:57,555
Thank you, Natalie.
- You should dance.

683
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:02,168
Come on.
- No, no, no.

684
00:55:02,254 --> 00:55:05,002
Come on.
- Oh!

685
00:55:21,403 --> 00:55:24,856
I'm Dave.
- I'm Natalie.

686
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:27,424
Who's Jennifer?

687
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,798
I don't know.

688
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:34,285
<i>How's everybody doing out there?</i>

689
00:55:35,593 --> 00:55:39,342
Right about now, give it up
for a very special alphaTECH guest.

690
00:55:39,428 --> 00:55:43,112
Young MC!

691
00:55:43,628 --> 00:55:45,742
What's up, alphaTECH?

692
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:49,874
I got a busted computer.
Can somebody fix it for me?

693
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:42,131
I want you to have a key to my place.

694
00:56:43,038 --> 00:56:47,513
Wow. I had no idea we were
at that point in our relationship.

695
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,435
Oh, yes.
- Wow.

696
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:56,477
Where is she?

697
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:33,743
Back home I don't get to act the way
I do with you.

698
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:37,791
That's why I don't have a back home.
- I know.

699
00:57:38,172 --> 00:57:42,943
You're so cool.
Mr Empty Backpack.

700
00:57:43,402 --> 00:57:45,483
You know about my backpack?
- I Googled you.

701
00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:46,609
You did?

702
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:50,265
It's what us modern girls do
when we have a crush.

703
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,013
Does it bother you?
- It depends.

704
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,891
Is the bag empty because you hate people or
because you hate the baggage they come along with?

705
00:57:57,977 --> 00:58:00,479
I don't hate people.
I'm not exactly a hermit.

706
00:58:00,565 --> 00:58:05,257
You just don't want to be tied down
with the whole responsibility thing.

707
00:58:05,604 --> 00:58:08,568
I don't know what
originally sparked the backpack.

708
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:11,559
Probably needed to be alone.

709
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:16,667
Recently, I've been thinking
that I needed to empty the backpack

710
00:58:16,753 --> 00:58:19,775
before I know what to put back in it.

711
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:42,194
<i>Oh, no!
- I think we're out of gas.</i>

712
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:24,490
Hey. You're up?

713
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:28,365
I have to fly standby
and make a meeting in Cincinnati.

714
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:35,066
I made you feel cheap.

715
00:59:35,152 --> 00:59:39,084
It's all right.
Just leave the money on the dresser.

716
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:43,211
I'll text you later
so we can swap schedules.

717
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:51,583
I really like you.

718
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,219
I like you too.
- Good.

719
00:59:57,446 --> 01:00:00,359
Go catch your plane.

720
01:00:12,198 --> 01:00:14,024
Last night er...

721
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:18,268
It was kind of out of hand.
I said things erm...

722
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:21,660
I'm not actually sure
everything that I said.

723
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:24,972
But I didn't want you to think...
- Just relax.

724
01:00:25,058 --> 01:00:27,791
It was nice to see you cut loose.

725
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:30,765
Did you wake him up or slip out?

726
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:34,972
What?
- This morning. Your new friend.

727
01:00:35,058 --> 01:00:36,911
Did you wake him up
for an awkward goodbye, or did you

728
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:40,535
just slip out
and make him feel like a whore?

729
01:00:41,658 --> 01:00:45,559
I just left.
- Protocol's always tricky.

730
01:00:48,016 --> 01:00:49,620
What happened to Alex?

731
01:00:49,706 --> 01:00:51,814
She had to leave town early
to get to a meeting.

732
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,995
That's too bad. Where's she live?
- Chicago.

733
01:00:56,438 --> 01:00:57,950
Thinking of going to see her?

734
01:00:58,036 --> 01:01:02,143
We don't really have that
kind of relationship. Try it over there.

735
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:06,007
What erm...
kind of relationship do you have?

736
01:01:06,093 --> 01:01:09,358
Well, you know...casual.

737
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:13,693
Sounds pretty special.
- It works for us.

738
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:16,614
Don't you think there's a future there?

739
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,207
I never thought about it.
What's going on?

740
01:01:19,293 --> 01:01:22,217
Really never thought about it?
- No.

741
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:25,475
How can you not think about that?

742
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:29,260
How does it not cross your mind
you might want a future with someone?

743
01:01:29,346 --> 01:01:32,461
It's simple. You know that moment
when you look into somebody's eyes

744
01:01:32,547 --> 01:01:38,039
and you can feel them staring into your soul and
the whole world goes quiet just for a second?

745
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:41,449
Yes.
- Right. Well, I don't.

746
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,322
You're an asshole.

747
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:47,641
I'm just dicking around. Give me a hand.
- Shouldn't you give her a chance?

748
01:01:47,727 --> 01:01:50,200
A chance for what?
- A chance at something real.

749
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:53,165
Natalie, your definition of real
will evolve as you get older.

750
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:57,679
Can you stop condescending for one second
or is it a principle of your bullshit philosophy?

751
01:01:57,765 --> 01:02:00,593
Bullshit philosophy?
- The isolation, the travelling.

752
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:03,187
Is that supposed to be charming?
- No, it's a life choice.

753
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:06,511
It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
- Wow. Big words.

754
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:10,120
Screw you.
- Screw you, too.

755
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:14,469
You have set up a way of life that makes it
impossible for you to have any human connection.

756
01:02:14,555 --> 01:02:19,457
And this woman comes along and
runs the gauntlet of your life choice,

757
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:22,692
and comes out on the other end smiling
just so you can call her "casual"?

758
01:02:22,778 --> 01:02:26,522
I need to grow up?
You're a 12-year-old.

759
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:29,418
I don't have a gauntlet...

760
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:33,887
Fuck.

761
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:17,934
Listen, these Detroit guys can be tough.
They're getting hammered.

762
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,132
Don't get distracted.
Stick with the simple stuff.

763
01:03:20,218 --> 01:03:24,526
Get these packets in their hands
and get them out the door, OK?

764
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:39,616
<i>Hey, welcome to Detroit.</i>

765
01:03:39,702 --> 01:03:41,464
What's going on here?

766
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,545
<i>I've been looking at those great numbers.
I thought we should nut up and give this a try.</i>

767
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:47,128
We could use a little more time.

768
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:49,929
<i>You gotta leave the nest at some point, huh?</i>

769
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,812
This a real company, Craig.
We're here to do some damage.

770
01:03:52,898 --> 01:03:56,594
<i>I know. It's a good thing we brought
our best. Let's stop screwing around.</i>

771
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,778
Just give me a minute to prepare
and get my things together.

772
01:03:59,864 --> 01:04:02,632
<i>I thought Natalie
was going to take this one.</i>

773
01:04:03,364 --> 01:04:04,824
She's hardly ready for that.

774
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,924
<i>I've watched her results
the last few days. She's great.</i>

775
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,652
This is a whole other animal.

776
01:04:08,738 --> 01:04:13,628
<i>You know, she created it, right?
Natalie, are you not up for it?</i>

777
01:04:14,943 --> 01:04:16,254
Yeah, I'm game.

778
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,672
<i>That's my girl.</i>

779
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:23,125
Just remember, don't apologise
or tell them how hard this is for you.

780
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:28,181
Today's one of the worst days they're ever
gonna have. How we feel doesn't even compare.

781
01:04:29,293 --> 01:04:33,657
Got it.
- Keep it professional. You'll be fine.

782
01:04:37,228 --> 01:04:38,703
<i>What's all this? What's going on?</i>

783
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:40,641
Hello, Mr Samuels.

784
01:04:40,727 --> 01:04:43,837
I wish I were here with better news.

785
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:48,187
However, your position here
is no longer available.

786
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,259
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

787
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,241
You've been let go.

788
01:04:54,327 --> 01:04:56,709
<i>Just like that?</i>

789
01:04:58,082 --> 01:05:00,255
<i>Who are you?</i>

790
01:05:01,006 --> 01:05:05,500
My name is Miss Keener and I'm here
today to talk about your options.

791
01:05:05,586 --> 01:05:11,759
<i>I worked for this company for 17 years
and they send a 4th-grader to can me?</i>

792
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:15,257
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

793
01:05:23,588 --> 01:05:26,318
It's perfectly normal to be upset.

794
01:05:26,404 --> 01:05:29,841
However, the sooner you can
tell yourself greater opportunities...

795
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:34,211
<i>Greater opportunities?
I'm 57 fucking years old.</i>

796
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,041
Anybody who ever built an empire or
changed the world sat where you are now.

797
01:05:42,368 --> 01:05:45,905
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

798
01:05:50,388 --> 01:05:55,225
There's a packet in front of you. I want
you to take some time and review it.

799
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:59,985
All the answers you're looking for
are inside those pages.

800
01:06:03,224 --> 01:06:08,635
The sooner you trust the process, the sooner
the next step of your life will unveil itself.

801
01:06:16,534 --> 01:06:20,525
I need you to go back to your office
and put together your personal things.

802
01:06:38,671 --> 01:06:42,382
Mr Samuels,
that's all we can discuss now.

803
01:06:46,012 --> 01:06:48,469
Mr Samuels.

804
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,005
Mr Samuels.

805
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,903
Mr Samuels!

806
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,129
You did good.

807
01:07:23,949 --> 01:07:26,620
You OK? You want me to take over?

808
01:07:26,706 --> 01:07:29,007
No, I'm all right.

809
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:49,607
Look, we just got here. That's
one place. We need to try a few more.

810
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:53,882
Maybe it makes no difference, but it's comforting
to know we're in the next room.

811
01:07:53,968 --> 01:07:57,233
I know you don't give a shit
about my comfort.

812
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:01,291
I think we could try a few more,
that's all I'm saying.

813
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:06,553
Fine.

814
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:12,885
All right. OK. All right.

815
01:08:18,252 --> 01:08:21,470
He thought you did a great job.
You did.

816
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:25,855
I'm real proud of you.
- Thanks.

817
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:30,546
They're pulling us off the road.

818
01:08:31,591 --> 01:08:33,545
We're going home.

819
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:39,121
Really? For good
- Yeah.

820
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,337
Good job.

821
01:09:02,853 --> 01:09:05,087
We request the pleasure of your company at the
wedding of Julie Bingham and James Arthur Miller

822
01:09:08,419 --> 01:09:11,613
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex.
That was out of line.

823
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:13,870
It's all right. I understand.

824
01:09:13,956 --> 01:09:17,388
I mean, who am I to be doling out
relationship advice, right?

825
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:19,981
No kidding.

826
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,002
Are you gonna be OK?

827
01:09:26,088 --> 01:09:29,718
What do you mean?
- In Omaha?

828
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:34,227
I don't know.

829
01:09:35,108 --> 01:09:37,723
It's better than you'd think.

830
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,251
Ryan.

831
01:09:48,337 --> 01:09:52,559
Ryan. Where are you going?
- I'm grabbing another flight.

832
01:09:52,645 --> 01:09:56,983
Something I've got to take care of.
I'll see you back at home.

833
01:10:14,674 --> 01:10:17,934
OK, walk it in a little.

834
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,988
<i>A little more.</i>

835
01:10:20,074 --> 01:10:23,787
There you go. Yeah.

836
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,291
Got it.

837
01:10:30,909 --> 01:10:33,022
They're a cute couple.

838
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:36,361
You think so?
- Yeah, they'll make cute kids.

839
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,071
How do you like Wisconsin
in February?

840
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:45,327
I like it if you're there.
I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

841
01:10:45,413 --> 01:10:47,218
Northern Wisconsin.

842
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:51,735
What are you doing this weekend?

843
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:54,305
No.
- What, I haven't...

844
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:58,633
You want me to be your date?
- Yeah. Yeah.

845
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,243
At your sister's wedding?
- It's not like I know her that well.

846
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:06,270
Look, I'm not the wedding type, right?

847
01:11:06,356 --> 01:11:08,999
But for the first time in my life I don't
want to be that guy alone at a bar.

848
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:11,761
I want a dance partner,
I want a "plus one".

849
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:15,876
And if you can stomach it,
I'd like it to be you.

850
01:11:40,658 --> 01:11:42,987
Excuse me. Are you available?

851
01:11:43,073 --> 01:11:47,166
This line's for members
of our Matterhorn Programme.

852
01:11:52,151 --> 01:11:54,660
Hey...Ryan.

853
01:11:55,138 --> 01:11:59,497
Hey.
- Kara. Hi.

854
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:02,083
Alex, this is my sister Kara.
- Hi.

855
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:04,732
Well, hello.

856
01:12:04,818 --> 01:12:08,817
Ryan's told me nothing about you.

857
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:12,079
So you two are dating?

858
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,395
Not exactly.
- Well, don't worry about it.

859
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:19,459
We're all getting a little old
to be calling someone girlfriend.

860
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:22,844
I remember when Mom
used to call Jack her boyfriend.

861
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:27,157
Drove me up the wall.
Boyfriends are for kids, right?

862
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:30,085
So what are you doing at the hotel?

863
01:12:30,171 --> 01:12:35,644
Yeah, OK, er...Frank and I
are trying out a trial separation.

864
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,825
I'm sorry. So you're not at the house?
- No, there was a room on hold here,

865
01:12:39,911 --> 01:12:43,188
so I thought I'd take it for the weekend.

866
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:49,591
So the rehearsal dinner?
- Yeah, tonight. I'll see you there.

867
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,218
Nice digs.

868
01:12:57,532 --> 01:13:00,025
There's a packet.

869
01:13:05,392 --> 01:13:07,137
Hey, look who's here.

870
01:13:07,223 --> 01:13:12,399
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ryan!
- Hey.

871
01:13:16,026 --> 01:13:19,329
Oh, you must be Alex.
- Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?

872
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:23,573
You are so beautiful. Kara was right.

873
01:13:24,656 --> 01:13:28,723
Gosh. You look so grown-up.

874
01:13:28,809 --> 01:13:31,347
I do?
You're the one that's getting married.

875
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:33,937
Oh, I know, right?

876
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:37,830
Oh. You haven't even seen my ring.

877
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:39,757
Oh, look at that.
- Oh, it's lovely.

878
01:13:39,843 --> 01:13:42,201
Jim designed it.

879
01:13:42,412 --> 01:13:44,817
Hey, Jim.

880
01:13:46,077 --> 01:13:48,303
Hey.
- How's it going?

881
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:50,957
Hey. I'm Ryan.
- Jim. Good to meet you.

882
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:53,962
Alex. Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

883
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:56,458
Thank you, guys, for coming.

884
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:59,043
Brother!

885
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:03,339
It's true, though.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

886
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:08,884
I got the pictures you asked me to get.
- You can just put them right there.

887
01:14:10,661 --> 01:14:13,302
Yeah, OK.

888
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:43,609
You got so many up there,
I almost didn't have room.

889
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:47,665
I know.
It's so great, everyone just chipped in.

890
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:51,005
What gave you the idea
to do something so...

891
01:14:51,091 --> 01:14:53,828
Substantial.
- Well...

892
01:14:53,973 --> 01:14:57,968
Jim has a lot of our nest egg
invested in this real estate venture.

893
01:14:58,054 --> 01:15:00,917
Mm-hm. It's a real estate investment.

894
01:15:01,003 --> 01:15:03,870
It's exciting,
but we went over our finances and...

895
01:15:03,956 --> 01:15:08,123
A honeymoon at this state in the game
doesn't really seem affordable.

896
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:10,198
So, you know, we just thought,

897
01:15:10,284 --> 01:15:13,920
just because we can't travel
doesn't mean we can't have pictures.

898
01:15:14,006 --> 01:15:16,566
I think that's a fabulous idea.
- Yeah, it's a good one.

899
01:15:16,652 --> 01:15:19,766
The concept is turnkey everything.

900
01:15:19,852 --> 01:15:23,106
You buy a maintenance contract when you
get the home. We'll whack your weeds,

901
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:27,942
change your light bulbs. Furniture - you can bring
your own or pick one of our packages.

902
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:31,868
Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.
- Nice.

903
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:37,489
We all need a place to call our own.
This is America. This is what we were promised.

904
01:15:37,787 --> 01:15:41,216
It's a nice touch.
- What?

905
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:43,432
The bit at the end about the promise.
I like that part.

906
01:15:43,518 --> 01:15:46,580
Oh, thanks.

907
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:53,086
You er...you still renting that one-bedroom?
- No. I gave it up.

908
01:15:53,172 --> 01:15:55,916
So you own now?
- No.

909
01:15:56,002 --> 01:15:58,061
But you're looking?

910
01:15:58,147 --> 01:16:00,896
No, not really.

911
01:16:01,143 --> 01:16:03,318
So you're just good?

912
01:16:03,653 --> 01:16:06,796
I'm good.
- Well, that's good.

913
01:16:06,882 --> 01:16:10,750
Can you believe it's tomorrow?
How are you gonna sleep?

914
01:16:10,836 --> 01:16:12,832
I don't know.

915
01:16:13,163 --> 01:16:16,352
Well, do you want some Xanax?
- I don't think that's for sleeping.

916
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:20,020
Yeah. No, I think I'll just have
a glass of warm milk.

917
01:16:20,106 --> 01:16:23,912
That'll do the trick.
- OK. See you tomorrow.

918
01:16:25,257 --> 01:16:27,927
There's another box inside.

919
01:16:28,013 --> 01:16:29,583
I'll grab it.
- You sure?

920
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:32,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:43,842
Jim seems like a good guy.
- Yeah, isn't he great?

922
01:16:43,928 --> 01:16:46,938
He's going to make a great husband.

923
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:54,146
You know, Julie, I was thinking,
you know, with Dad not being here, erm...

924
01:16:54,463 --> 01:16:58,332
I was wondering if you had anybody
to walk you down the aisle.

925
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:07,922
No, Jim's uncle is gonna do it.
- He's been really supportive.

926
01:17:08,008 --> 01:17:09,644
He's been great.

927
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:13,758
Well, good. That's great.
I just wanted to make sure that you...

928
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:17,342
I wanted you to be covered, that's all.

929
01:17:20,037 --> 01:17:22,300
So, I should be there, what?

930
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:28,460
The other guests are arriving around
five and things get going at five-thirty so...

931
01:17:28,546 --> 01:17:31,455
around then.
- OK.

932
01:17:33,075 --> 01:17:36,975
Oh. Let me...
I'm gonna help you with those.

933
01:17:38,059 --> 01:17:40,252
Got it.

934
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:44,891
It's OK. It's OK, it's OK.

935
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:54,921
None of that was here.

936
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:57,776
This is all new.

937
01:18:08,034 --> 01:18:10,004
Really?

938
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:14,051
Is that all you got?
- What?

939
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:22,970
Give me a boost.

940
01:18:24,001 --> 01:18:26,165
Watch...

941
01:18:26,384 --> 01:18:28,838
Hang on.

942
01:18:35,227 --> 01:18:37,832
I took Geography in here.

943
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:40,353
You ever fool around
with one of your teachers?

944
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:44,924
No. Did you?
- No. Not until college.

945
01:18:49,297 --> 01:18:52,086
That's me on the right.

946
01:18:53,218 --> 01:18:57,786
It's kinda hard to tell.
- You can tell by the eyebrows.

947
01:18:57,997 --> 01:19:02,230
You played basketball?
- I was a point guard. Don't act so surprised.

948
01:19:02,316 --> 01:19:05,777
I didn't know you were such a jock.

949
01:19:05,863 --> 01:19:08,107
That's me too.

950
01:19:08,193 --> 01:19:11,150
And that.

951
01:19:12,641 --> 01:19:14,964
My first fight.
- How'd it go?

952
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,509
Got my ass kicked.

953
01:19:17,595 --> 01:19:26,034
This is where we used to go to make out.
- Oh, yes. Yeah. This is very romantic.

954
01:19:37,949 --> 01:19:42,458
I'm really happy I came here.
- So am I.

955
01:19:48,072 --> 01:19:50,358
It's Kara.

956
01:19:51,293 --> 01:19:54,063
Ryan, where are you?
We're having a meltdown here.

957
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:55,246
What's going on? What happened?

958
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,604
It's Jim. Can you get back here?
We need your help.

959
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,036
OK.

960
01:20:00,806 --> 01:20:03,118
We gotta go.

961
01:20:05,831 --> 01:20:09,412
I'll grab your suit.
- Thanks.

962
01:20:27,548 --> 01:20:30,258
What happened?
- Jim's got cold feet.

963
01:20:30,344 --> 01:20:32,995
Today?
- Yeah, that's how cold feet work.

964
01:20:33,081 --> 01:20:36,122
What do you want me to do?
- Talk to him.

965
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:39,100
You want me to talk to him?
- Hey, it's either you or me.

966
01:20:39,186 --> 01:20:41,670
You know my track record.
I've already struck out once.

967
01:20:41,756 --> 01:20:44,268
I haven't been to bat.
I haven't been in the dugout.

968
01:20:44,354 --> 01:20:47,006
Don't you talk for a living?
Motivational-type stuff?

969
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,715
I tell people how to avoid commitment.

970
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:53,020
It's a philosophy.
- It's stupid.

971
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:56,250
Hey, it could have helped you.
- Ryan.

972
01:20:56,336 --> 01:21:01,604
You haven't been around much.
Fuck - basically, you don't exist to us.

973
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,523
I know you wanna be there for her.

974
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:09,015
Well, here it is. This is your chance.

975
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:32,280
Hey. What's up, Ryan?

976
01:21:33,407 --> 01:21:36,739
Jim.
- You ever read this before?

977
01:21:37,006 --> 01:21:41,768
Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
- I'll say.

978
01:21:44,117 --> 01:21:49,985
Er...Kara mentioned that you were
having some thoughts.

979
01:21:50,132 --> 01:21:54,923
I don't think I'm going to be able to er...
to do this.

980
01:21:55,151 --> 01:21:58,916
Why would you say that...today?

981
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:03,288
Well, last night I was kinda laying
in bed and I couldn't get to sleep.

982
01:22:03,374 --> 01:22:06,697
So I started thinking about the wedding
and the ceremony,

983
01:22:06,783 --> 01:22:10,171
and about our buying a house
and moving in together.

984
01:22:10,257 --> 01:22:14,090
And having a kid,
and having another kid and then

985
01:22:14,446 --> 01:22:16,758
Christmas and Thanksgiving
and spring break.

986
01:22:16,844 --> 01:22:20,318
Going to football games, and then
all of a sudden they're graduating.

987
01:22:20,404 --> 01:22:24,440
They're getting jobs, getting married.
And, you know, I'm a grandparent.

988
01:22:24,526 --> 01:22:27,847
And then I'm retired.
I'm losing my hair, I'm getting fat.

989
01:22:27,933 --> 01:22:30,403
And then the next thing you know
I'm dead.

990
01:22:30,489 --> 01:22:35,088
I'm just, like...I can't stop from thinking,
what's the point?

991
01:22:37,555 --> 01:22:40,608
I mean, what is the point?

992
01:22:40,697 --> 01:22:45,678
The point?
- What am I starting here?

993
01:22:46,573 --> 01:22:50,027
Jim, it's...marriage.

994
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:54,756
It's one of the most beautiful things on earth.
It's what people aspire to.

995
01:22:54,842 --> 01:22:57,740
You never got married.
- That's true.

996
01:22:57,826 --> 01:23:02,127
I mean, you never even tried.
- Well, it's hard to define try.

997
01:23:02,213 --> 01:23:06,687
I don't know, just you seem happier
than all my married friends.

998
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:12,086
Look, Jim, I'm not going to lie to you.
Marriage can be a pain in the ass.

999
01:23:12,172 --> 01:23:16,955
And you're right. This all is just stuff
that leads to your eventual demise.

1000
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:19,097
Yes.
- And we're all on running clocks.

1001
01:23:19,183 --> 01:23:22,525
And they can't be slowed down
or paused.

1002
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:26,965
And...we all end up in the same place.
- yeah.

1003
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:33,116
There is no point.
- There is no point. That's what I'm saying.

1004
01:23:37,447 --> 01:23:40,100
You know, er...

1005
01:23:40,497 --> 01:23:44,758
I'm not normally the guy
you would talk to about stuff like this.

1006
01:23:47,671 --> 01:23:50,336
If you think about it...

1007
01:23:51,518 --> 01:23:55,471
your favourite memories, the most
important moments in your life.

1008
01:23:55,762 --> 01:23:57,832
Were you alone?

1009
01:23:58,195 --> 01:24:02,047
No, I guess not.

1010
01:24:02,374 --> 01:24:04,412
Come to think of it,

1011
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:07,705
last night, the night before your wedding
when all this shit is swirling around in your head,

1012
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:10,233
weren't you guys in separate bedrooms?

1013
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:15,651
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and
I was just by myself in the honeymoon suite.

1014
01:24:15,737 --> 01:24:19,545
Kinda lonely, huh?
- Yes, it was pretty lonely.

1015
01:24:20,617 --> 01:24:23,541
Life's better with company.

1016
01:24:24,441 --> 01:24:28,798
Yeah...
- Everybody needs a co-pilot.

1017
01:24:30,059 --> 01:24:33,336
That was a nice touch.
- Thanks.

1018
01:24:35,415 --> 01:24:40,265
So er... what's the mood like out there?
- It's not good.

1019
01:24:40,351 --> 01:24:44,176
She's pretty pissed?
- Just upset.

1020
01:24:45,418 --> 01:24:48,100
What should I do?

1021
01:24:49,455 --> 01:24:51,748
Go get her.

1022
01:25:05,443 --> 01:25:08,997
I'm such a fuck-up.
I love you so much.

1023
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:12,205
Will you be my co-pilot?

1024
01:25:13,303 --> 01:25:16,825
Yes. Yes.

1025
01:25:21,004 --> 01:25:23,681
Welcome home.

1026
01:27:57,902 --> 01:28:01,915
OK, this is your stop.

1027
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:12,783
When am I gonna see you?
- You're just gonna have to come visit.

1028
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:15,685
Oh...so settled.

1029
01:28:16,256 --> 01:28:23,077
You're not gonna change on me, are you?
- No. Same guy. Just one address.

1030
01:28:23,642 --> 01:28:29,103
<i>This is your final boarding
call for Flight 3972 to Chicago.</i>

1031
01:28:30,002 --> 01:28:33,768
Right. Call me when you get lonely.

1032
01:28:36,054 --> 01:28:38,471
I'm lonely.

1033
01:29:10,919 --> 01:29:12,961
Some guy sits in a conference room somewhere

1034
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:16,328
and our server routes his session
to one of our termination engineers.

1035
01:29:16,414 --> 01:29:18,021
"Termination engineers"? Really?

1036
01:29:18,107 --> 01:29:20,755
I preferred "terminators"
but it bumped with Legal.

1037
01:29:20,841 --> 01:29:22,225
Can't imagine why.

1038
01:29:22,311 --> 01:29:26,246
The workflow takes them through anything
from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.

1039
01:29:26,332 --> 01:29:28,476
What are they doing now, practising?

1040
01:29:28,562 --> 01:29:33,103
Beta testing, role-playing.
We go live at the end of the month.

1041
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:35,581
Kyle, you're running through the events
too quickly.

1042
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:39,511
Give them time to acknowledge
each statement. It's a legal thing.

1043
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,759
Ryan?
- Mm? Oh. Yeah. There's more?

1044
01:29:50,078 --> 01:29:51,333
This is ridiculous.

1045
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:56,605
<i>Legal's starting to come hard
at me on this term "terminate"...</i>

1046
01:30:22,354 --> 01:30:25,823
<i>Life to the power of you!</i>

1047
01:30:35,074 --> 01:30:38,212
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. Put your hands
together for today's challenge speaker,</i>

1048
01:30:38,298 --> 01:30:41,260
<i>Mr Ryan Bingham</i>

1049
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,217
Go get 'em.

1050
01:30:54,091 --> 01:30:58,567
Last year I flew 350,000 miles.

1051
01:30:58,747 --> 01:31:01,360
The moon is 250.

1052
01:31:03,861 --> 01:31:08,240
I want you to imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

1053
01:31:08,326 --> 01:31:11,465
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders

1054
01:31:12,072 --> 01:31:14,192
You feel 'em?

1055
01:31:15,145 --> 01:31:20,638
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

1056
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:27,695
Start with the little things -
the things on shelves and in drawers.

1057
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,708
Excuse me.

1058
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:53,582
What the fuck are you doing?

1059
01:31:53,668 --> 01:31:58,622
<i>Relax. We'll have
your next guest out in one sec.</i>

1060
01:32:20,341 --> 01:32:23,382
Hey, you gotta sign.
- OK.

1061
01:32:24,391 --> 01:32:26,814
OK, thank you.

1062
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:33,320
Hey, you forgot to give me
your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!

1063
01:33:08,076 --> 01:33:10,785
So I was in the neighbourhood.

1064
01:33:25,444 --> 01:33:30,379
<i>Hey, honey, who's at the door?
- Just somebody who's lost.</i>

1065
01:34:27,998 --> 01:34:29,198
Alex?

1066
01:34:29,284 --> 01:34:32,211
What were you thinking,
showing up at my door like that?

1067
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:36,156
What do you mean? I wanted to see you.
I didn't know you had a family.

1068
01:34:36,242 --> 01:34:37,957
Why didn't you tell me that?

1069
01:34:38,043 --> 01:34:41,880
Sorry I ruined your evening but you
could have screwed things up for me.

1070
01:34:41,966 --> 01:34:46,533
That's my family. That's my real life.

1071
01:34:48,111 --> 01:34:51,628
I thought I was a part of your real life.

1072
01:34:52,002 --> 01:34:55,126
I thought we signed up
for the same thing.

1073
01:34:56,255 --> 01:35:01,061
Try and help me understand exactly
what it is that you signed up for.

1074
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:06,129
I thought our relationship
was perfectly clear. I mean...

1075
01:35:06,215 --> 01:35:09,586
you are an escape.

1076
01:35:10,869 --> 01:35:13,602
<i>You're a break from our normal lives,
you're a...</i>

1077
01:35:13,688 --> 01:35:16,748
a parenthesis.

1078
01:35:18,955 --> 01:35:20,677
I'm a parenthesis?

1079
01:35:20,763 --> 01:35:25,128
I mean...
what do you want?

1080
01:35:26,211 --> 01:35:28,768
Tell me what you want.

1081
01:35:32,865 --> 01:35:35,616
You don't even know what you want.

1082
01:35:35,702 --> 01:35:40,107
<i>Ryan, I'm a grown-up, OK?</i>

1083
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:45,580
So if you would like to see me again,
then then give me a call.

1084
01:35:46,529 --> 01:35:48,807
OK?

1085
01:36:03,826 --> 01:36:06,810
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a special announcement to make.</i>

1086
01:36:06,896 --> 01:36:11,266
Our pilot has just informed me that we
are passing over the city of Dubuque,

1087
01:36:11,352 --> 01:36:16,792
which might not mean much to most of you,
but means a lot to one of our flyers today.

1088
01:36:16,878 --> 01:36:22,907
Oh, no.
- He just hit 10 million miles!

1089
01:36:25,591 --> 01:36:28,627
Congratulations.
- Such an amazing accomplishment.

1090
01:36:28,713 --> 01:36:31,443
You must be very excited.

1091
01:36:31,529 --> 01:36:33,940
Hi, Captain.
- Captain.

1092
01:36:34,026 --> 01:36:36,345
That seat taken?

1093
01:36:36,431 --> 01:36:38,969
No. No.

1094
01:36:44,975 --> 01:36:48,338
You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.

1095
01:36:48,424 --> 01:36:51,418
Don't know where you found the time.

1096
01:36:51,504 --> 01:36:54,988
Yeah.
I don't know.

1097
01:37:00,006 --> 01:37:02,156
Here you go.

1098
01:37:03,636 --> 01:37:06,589
Seventh card we've made.

1099
01:37:06,803 --> 01:37:09,296
Small club.

1100
01:37:10,895 --> 01:37:14,700
We really appreciate your loyalty.

1101
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,130
You know how many times
I thought about this moment?

1102
01:37:22,033 --> 01:37:25,481
Played out the conversation
that you and I would have right here.

1103
01:37:25,567 --> 01:37:27,748
Really?

1104
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:32,692
What did you want to say?

1105
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:39,529
You know, I don't remember.

1106
01:37:41,051 --> 01:37:45,777
That's all right.
It happens to all of us.

1107
01:37:48,752 --> 01:37:51,326
So where are you from?

1108
01:37:56,873 --> 01:37:59,343
I'm from here.

1109
01:38:17,051 --> 01:38:19,380
<i>Hello, Mr Bingham.</i>

1110
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,571
How did you know it was me?

1111
01:38:21,657 --> 01:38:26,437
<i>This is your dedicated line. We reserve them
for our most loyal and appreciated flyers.</i>

1112
01:38:26,523 --> 01:38:32,076
I'd like to transfer some of my miles.
Can I open up an account to Jim and Julie Miller?

1113
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:34,928
<i>Certainly. How many miles
would you like to transfer?</i>

1114
01:38:35,014 --> 01:38:37,305
How many miles does it take
to circle the globe?

1115
01:38:37,391 --> 01:38:41,667
<i>We have our round-the-world tickets.
They're 500,000 miles each.</i>

1116
01:38:41,753 --> 01:38:43,396
That'd be fine.
- Got a second?

1117
01:38:43,482 --> 01:38:44,932
I'll call you back.

1118
01:38:45,018 --> 01:38:47,587
What happened to you yesterday?
I was trying to get hold of you.

1119
01:38:47,673 --> 01:38:51,506
I was some personal stuff.
What's going on?

1120
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,037
Do you remember Karen Barnes,

1121
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:57,895
part of a 30-person reduction
a few weeks back in Wichita?

1122
01:38:57,981 --> 01:39:03,042
Natalie fired her.
- Fired dozens of people a day. I...

1123
01:39:03,128 --> 01:39:06,193
She killed herself - jumped off a bridge.

1124
01:39:07,795 --> 01:39:09,224
Fuck.

1125
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:13,632
I need to know if you remember
any woman that gave you any signals,

1126
01:39:13,718 --> 01:39:16,844
depression...
- They're all depressed. We're firing them.

1127
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:22,308
Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, OK?
- No, I don't remember anything.

1128
01:39:22,687 --> 01:39:25,858
You never think that they're...

1129
01:39:26,423 --> 01:39:28,282
You don't remember any woman
that gave you any signals?

1130
01:39:28,368 --> 01:39:32,684
Anything at all, Ryan?
- No, nothing stands out.

1131
01:39:35,293 --> 01:39:39,242
Is Natalie all right?
- Natalie quit.

1132
01:39:42,224 --> 01:39:46,138
She quit?
- Text message.

1133
01:39:46,581 --> 01:39:50,259
Fucking nice, right?
No-one's got any manners any more.

1134
01:39:50,345 --> 01:39:55,312
Did she say where she was going?
- No. She was a little upset.

1135
01:39:56,556 --> 01:39:59,154
I should give her a call.

1136
01:40:01,867 --> 01:40:04,936
I need you back in the air.

1137
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:10,779
Hey. Did you hear what I said?
I thought you'd be thrilled about that.

1138
01:40:10,865 --> 01:40:13,841
It's fine. What about
the videoconferencing?

1139
01:40:13,927 --> 01:40:20,048
CTC is going to pause the new media front.
They're gonna give it some more thought.

1140
01:40:20,134 --> 01:40:24,678
We are gonna get our workhorses back
in the air doing what they do best, OK?

1141
01:40:25,876 --> 01:40:28,168
How long are you sending me out?

1142
01:40:28,254 --> 01:40:33,395
We're gonna let you sail and sail.
You send us a postcard if you ever get there.

1143
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:49,670
So what happened?

1144
01:40:50,653 --> 01:40:52,924
How exactly do you mean?

1145
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:55,276
You graduated top of your class.

1146
01:40:55,362 --> 01:40:58,044
You seemed to have your pick of
employment, including here.

1147
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:02,902
Instead you went to Omaha
to fire people for a living?

1148
01:41:04,281 --> 01:41:07,164
It's challenging work.
- I'll say!

1149
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:10,203
I can't imagine doing that,
day in, day out.

1150
01:41:10,289 --> 01:41:12,582
Not in this climate.

1151
01:41:14,077 --> 01:41:16,874
I followed a boy.

1152
01:41:20,523 --> 01:41:23,792
I guess everybody does that
at one point or another.

1153
01:41:29,241 --> 01:41:31,657
This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.

1154
01:41:31,743 --> 01:41:33,975
<i>To whom it may concern.</i>

1155
01:41:34,061 --> 01:41:37,129
<i>I can't even count the number
of people I've fired in my lifetime.</i>

1156
01:41:37,215 --> 01:41:40,823
<i>So many that I've actually forgotten
what it's like to hire somebody.</i>

1157
01:41:40,909 --> 01:41:45,925
<i>We've never met, but I know you'd
be lucky to have Natalie Keener.</i>

1158
01:41:46,011 --> 01:41:48,851
<i>My advice?
Take her and don't look back.</i>

1159
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:52,627
<i>She'll be the best decision
you've made in a long time.</i>

1160
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:59,091
I sure hope he's right.

1161
01:42:09,997 --> 01:42:11,920
<i>Well, I don't have a lot of hope,</i>

1162
01:42:12,006 --> 01:42:14,624
<i>and I really don't know
when it's gonna get better.</i>

1163
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:17,354
There's a lot of people unemployed.

1164
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:22,637
And I really don't know when there's
gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.

1165
01:42:22,723 --> 01:42:24,387
I can't find much to talk about.

1166
01:42:24,473 --> 01:42:27,323
Talk about being proud.
I'm proud of my kids.

1167
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:32,533
I think the anger comes from the fact
that I just wasn't needed any more.

1168
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:34,782
I would say, you know, uh...

1169
01:42:34,868 --> 01:42:37,592
without my friends and my family,

1170
01:42:37,678 --> 01:42:39,492
I wouldn't have made it.

1171
01:42:39,578 --> 01:42:42,388
It would have been a lot tougher
if I'd had to make it on my own.

1172
01:42:42,474 --> 01:42:46,721
When I wake up in the morning
and I look over and I see my wife,

1173
01:42:46,807 --> 01:42:49,723
that gives me the sense of purpose.

1174
01:42:49,809 --> 01:42:52,695
It's not all about the money.
Money can keep you warm.

1175
01:42:52,781 --> 01:42:57,136
It pays your heating bills.
It can buy you a blanket.

1176
01:42:58,004 --> 01:43:02,355
But it doesn't keep you as warm
as when my husband holds me.

1177
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:07,192
Let me get up. Let me get out.
Let me find something.

1178
01:43:07,565 --> 01:43:12,524
So my kids are my purpose.
My family.

1179
01:43:41,193 --> 01:43:46,380
<i>Tonight most people will be welcomed
home by jumping dogs and squealing kids.</i>

1180
01:43:46,856 --> 01:43:51,213
<i>Their spouses will ask about their day
and tonight they'll sleep.</i>

1181
01:43:51,765 --> 01:43:56,450
<i>The stars will wheel forth
from their daytime hiding places.</i>

1182
01:43:57,269 --> 01:44:00,476
<i>And one of those lights,
slightly brighter than the rest,</i>

1183
01:44:00,727 --> 01:44:04,692
<i>will be my wing tip passing over.</i>

1184
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:20,581

<i>Hi, Jason. My name is Kevin.
And I recently lost my job.</i>

1186
01:46:19,867 --> 01:46:25,768
<i>I wrote this song as sort of
a statement about uncertainty</i>

1187
01:46:25,854 --> 01:46:29,224
<i>and having a certain amount of anxiety
about the future.</i>

1188
01:46:29,907 --> 01:46:32,969
<i>So maybe you can use it in your movie.</i>
