1
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,321
So the next week, he's even hornier,

2
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,740
but this time he's got
20 bucks instead of 10.

3
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,949
He goes back to
the whorehouse,

4
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,786
he slaps down a 20, tells
the madam he needs to get off

5
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,205
but he ain't gonna screw
no damn chicken this time.

6
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,041
She says it still ain't
much, but she can help.

7
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,794
She tells him to go to the
room at the top of the stairs.

8
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,588
This time, it's just a
bunch of guys jerking off.

9
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,091
But one of the jerk-off guys assures
him. You know, "It's cool, it's cool,"

10
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,011
and he waves him over
to this hole in the floor

11
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,221
that they're all
looking through.

12
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,641
Can we stop, please? I
really gotta take a piss.

13
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,435
Fuck you.

14
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,979
So anyway, there's these two hot
lesbians and they're going at it.

15
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,800
What, are you praying now?

16
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:02,515
Oh, Lord, won't you grant me an
empty mayonnaise jar to piss in?

17
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,394
You know, Krug,

18
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:10,565
considering the rather notorious
nature of the prison you're headed to,

19
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,359
I think I'd pray for something
a little bit more substantial.

20
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,573
Fuck!

21
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,869
Come on.

22
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,746
Here.

23
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,131
You okay? Yeah.

24
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,514
Did I do good?

25
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,350
Tell me I did good!

26
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,977
Hit us a little harder next
time, Francis. Where's my kid?

27
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,520
He's fine.

28
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,909
What? I can't understand you!

29
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,372
I think he's saying,
"Take my money."

30
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,374
Take the money, huh?

31
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,045
I think he's dying now.

32
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,298
What do you think he's seeing?

33
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,973
Something he'll
never see again.

34
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,408
Hi.

35
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,702
What's my time?

36
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,329
It's perfect, awesome.

37
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,415
Come on. Hand it over.

38
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,168
Come on. Let me see it.

39
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,794
It's great.

40
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,005
Mom, let me see.

41
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,134
Sweetheart, your time is perfect,
okay. It's time for vacation.

42
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,053
Tell the or that
the compound fracture

43
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,429
to the left femur
is on its way up.

44
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,557
We're transfusing two units of O-Neg.
I want them to have plenty more on hand.

45
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes, Doctor. So, Mr. Hadley,

46
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,226
can you just follow my finger?

47
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,937
Just like that. Excellent.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

48
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,607
We'll get you back on your
bike in no time. Let's go, guys.

49
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,150
I love that shirt, by the way.

50
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,737
The color alone must've taken
a few minutes of your time.

51
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,697
Hi. Hey.

52
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,491
Hey, Mary-Anne. Yeah?

53
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,868
Where's that head CT. I
ordered? It's been half an hour.

54
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,705
He got a B-minus for the
semester, which is fantastic,

55
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,500
and I will be happy to write
him a letter of recommendation.

56
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,754
Yeah, if you need to get in touch
with me this summer, you have my cell.

57
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,007
Okay, have a great
summer. All right. Bye-bye.

58
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,261
That woman drives me nuts.

59
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,390
Okay, so are you on vacation
now or should I just make a U-ey?

60
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,653
Dad?

61
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,865
Dad? Honey!

62
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,745
Yo, yo. What's up, what's up?

63
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,126
Are we there yet?

64
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,378
We are making the turn now.

65
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,678
Geez, you think somebody
would change that sign.

66
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,056
I kind of like it. It tells
me the turn's coming up.

67
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,759
My hydrangea came back.

68
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,897
Place looks good.

69
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,819
Yeah. I'm sure inside is
a different story, but...

70
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,073
Why? Yeah, why?

71
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,494
I didn't tell you? Dan
was up fishing last week.

72
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,540
No, Em, you didn't. You
let your brother stay here?

73
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,584
Yeah. U nsupervised?

74
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,171
Honey, don't worry. I made him promise
to sleep in the guest house. It's fine.

75
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:11,383
So he and whoever he was with
trashed not one house but two, right?

76
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,637
Would you mind if I
stayed in the guest house?

77
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,890
I promise I won't trash it.

78
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,926
"Hey, kids, have
a drink on me.

79
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,513
"Thanks for letting me fish
the lake out. Love, Dan. "

80
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,515
This is $4 champagne.

81
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,018
So? Be nice.

82
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,050
Oh, shit.

83
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,592
Jesus. Hi.

84
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,135
Hi. What the...

85
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,970
Microwave is broken?

86
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,346
I don't know how he did it.

87
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,142
Oh, no. Honey, my brother
did not break the microwave.

88
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,478
You have no evidence of that.

89
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,355
Hey, do you guys
need the car today?

90
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,403
'Cause I was thinking maybe
I could meet up with Paige.

91
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,739
She said she'd
be working today.

92
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,327
Okay. But we just got here. I was
gonna cook supper and hangout and...

93
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:52,414
Well, maybe you guys could have
a nice dinner alone tonight?

94
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,376
Here you go.

95
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,216
Mom, are you sure?

96
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,137
No, I'm not sure, but Dad
seems awfully sure about it.

97
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,306
I know that you haven't
seen Paige in a while. So...

98
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,141
Here. Have fun.

99
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,186
Whoa. Thanks, Dad.

100
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,563
All right.

101
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:21,026
Just promise, promise that you will
call me. Okay? That's all I'm asking.

102
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,403
Okay, I will. All right?

103
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,323
Love you. I love you.

104
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,533
Bye, babe.

105
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,577
Bye, Dad. I'll see
you guys later. Okay.

106
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,289
Please be careful.

107
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,142
I don't know if you're
gonna be able to keep up

108
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,979
with the fast pace of the town, but
we just got a new yogurt stand, so...

109
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,147
Whoa, you think you can
get us a table? Yeah.

110
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,608
You know, I got connections. I
could probably pull some strings.

111
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,819
How much do I
owe you for this?

112
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,654
That is $5.25.

113
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,115
Thank you. Have a good day.

114
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,911
Listen, Mari, I...

115
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,622
I couldn't believe it
when I heard about Ben.

116
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,832
I know.

117
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,208
I know I should
have called you.

118
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,588
I just figured... Paige,
you're fine. It's...

119
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,923
Well...

120
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,301
Okay, new subject. Yeah, yeah.

121
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,428
So, what do you feel
like doing tonight?

122
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,764
Do you... Do you
still smoke pot?

123
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,601
No, I don't really
do that stuff anymore.

124
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,645
Yeah, you're like a
big athlete now, or...

125
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,939
Hey.

126
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,277
Yeah, do you need a
basket for all that?

127
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,699
I don't think we've
met. What's your name?

128
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,785
It's Justin.

129
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,788
Justin, I'm Paige.
And this is Mari.

130
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,291
Mari, this is Justin.
Justin, this is Mari.

131
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,126
Hi. Hey.

132
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,544
Is that all for you?

133
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,129
Can I get a pack
of cigarettes?

134
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,964
Can I get some ID?

135
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,051
Can you just give me a pass?

136
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,220
Justin, I would if I
ruled the world, but...

137
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,683
What if you help
me and I help you?

138
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,353
And how are you gonna help me?

139
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:24,816
Look, you know, I've got some premium
grade-A shit back at the motel.

140
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,068
Really?

141
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,404
Yeah, I mean, you can
see it for yourself.

142
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,078
I mean, I overheard you guys
talking a second ago, so...

143
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:46,380
That's $ 13.20, right?

144
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,647
Okay, from $20.
Here you go. Thanks.

145
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,024
Your turn.

146
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,904
Here we are. Very
fancy, Justin.

147
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,823
Left or right? Left.

148
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,743
So, Mari, I'll just run in and grab
it, and then we can go back to my place.

149
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,203
My dad's not gonna
be home all night.

150
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,163
Okay, five minutes.

151
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,461
All right, I'll
be two minutes.

152
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,612
Now it's weather and traffic,
and there's going to be

153
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,408
big clusters of storms developing,
going into nighttime hours as well...

154
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,523
Sorry, so sorry,
ma'am. It's...

155
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,820
This belong you?

156
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,489
No. No, sorry.

157
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,057
What the hell, you guys?

158
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,769
Mari, Justin was not kidding.
This is really good shit.

159
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,812
Clearly.

160
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,189
So how long were you
gonna let me sit out there?

161
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,483
Here. Have some.

162
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,360
Paige, we just had
this conversation.

163
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,988
Come on. She's a
little out of practice.

164
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,657
Take it.

165
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,579
I'm just sitting on the bed. One
joint won't hurt you. Take it.

166
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,805
Hold on.

167
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,977
Hello, Mom?

168
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,313
Hey, Mari, you were supposed
to call me an hour ago.

169
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,607
I know. I'm sorry.

170
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,277
There's a storm coming in.
What time are you coming home?

171
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,698
I was thinking maybe I could
just spend the night with Paige.

172
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,783
No, no, no. That
is not a good idea.

173
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,285
Listen to me. You're
17 years old...

174
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,082
Hello? Mom? You're breaking
up. I can't hear you.

175
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,626
Hello? Honey?
Hello? Are you there?

176
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,630
Mom, if you can hear me, I'll be
back first thing in the morning, okay?

177
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,799
I love you. Oh, my...

178
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,014
Who was that? That
was your daughter.

179
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,141
Now she's spending
the night with Paige.

180
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,310
This is ridiculous. I
knew this was gonna happen.

181
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,895
I should have
never let her leave.

182
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,397
There isn't much
we can do about it.

183
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,982
She does have the car.

184
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:11,686
So, Justin, my new found friend,
are you from a really big city?

185
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,607
No, you know, I'm
kind of from all over.

186
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,691
All over.

187
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,861
My dad and uncle have us
moving around a lot, so...

188
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,030
What do they do?

189
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,077
All sorts of things. You know,
I'm kind of out of the loop.

190
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,413
Well, where's your mom?

191
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,627
She's dead.

192
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,713
I'm sorry.

193
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,091
That's all right.

194
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,054
When did she die?

195
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,559
It was a while ago, so...

196
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,646
That's probably
enough death talk.

197
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,565
Do you wanna move on
to a happier subject?

198
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,901
Sure.

199
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,115
Someone died?

200
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,994
My brother. About a year ago.

201
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,537
A year ago?

202
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,126
What was his name? Ben.

203
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,801
Sorry.

204
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,514
You know what, Mari?

205
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,641
I think Justin here
could be kind of cute

206
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:36,021
if he lost his whole, like, creepy, hooded,
U nabomber kind of vibe he's got going on.

207
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,149
Don't you think? Yeah.

208
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,402
Look at this face he's got.

209
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,365
Here. Here, put this on.

210
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,034
No, actually that's... You
know, that's my uncle's.

211
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,161
Well, he's not here.
Just put it on. Come on.

212
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,164
Model it. Go on. Put it on.

213
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:00,712
Not bad. Yeah,

214
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,381
but the hair doesn't
match the shirt anymore.

215
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,341
What could we do?

216
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,136
Come on, sit down.

217
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,556
All right. I need some water.

218
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,392
You're gonna
love it. Trust us.

219
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,604
Okay. Do you think the
collar should go up or down?

220
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,230
Put it up.

221
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,066
Collar up. No, collar
up. I think collar down.

222
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,650
Fabio.

223
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,945
I love it. It's a big
improvement, Justin.

224
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,655
You're gonna get
all the ladies.

225
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,990
Oh, yeah.

226
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,582
Evening.

227
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,336
Dad.

228
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,925
I... I thought you guys
weren't coming back...

229
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,095
Well, our timeline's
gotten sped up, so...

230
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,682
Why? What's going on?

231
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,061
For Christ's sake, nephew,
are you gonna introduce us?

232
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:03,066
Yeah, Frank. This is
Mari. That's Paige.

233
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,443
That's my U ncle Frank, Sadie.

234
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,238
That's my dad.

235
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,325
These are two
lovely girls, Justin.

236
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,995
Smells like you three have
been having some fun in here.

237
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,707
Yeah, it's like a regular
party. Who else you invite?

238
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,253
Nobody. It's just us.

239
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,964
Dad, look, I was just
trying to liquidate some...

240
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:30,260
Liquidate? Is that
my word or yours?

241
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,555
Mine. But... Am
I wrong? Is that...

242
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,974
No, Justin, you're not wrong.

243
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,311
Is that my shirt?

244
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,941
Yeah, Frank, I'm sorry...
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.

245
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,528
Keep it on. Looks good on you.

246
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,576
You know, we were
just... Playing dress up?

247
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,413
Well, I mean, we just sort of
gave him a bit of a makeover.

248
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,957
A makeover, really? No.

249
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,083
Yeah.

250
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,378
Well, I think that's the
greatest thing I've ever heard.

251
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,134
Wow. We'll just get
out of your way, Justin.

252
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,054
How much do we owe you? I
love your sweatshirt, Mari.

253
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,099
That your sport
utility out there, Mari?

254
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,601
Yeah. Nice.

255
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,687
Yeah, we could use a vehicle
like that right about now.

256
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,190
Yeah, 'cause ours is
pretty well fucked.

257
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,774
Like we are.

258
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,613
Thanks to you,
pumpkin. Fuck you!

259
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,698
Later maybe.

260
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,658
Dad, what is going on...

261
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,122
We made the front page.
That's what's going on!

262
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,082
We figured they'd have my
face on there sooner or later,

263
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,710
but now they got
Sadie's to boot.

264
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,880
Can you believe
it, Paige, Mari?

265
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,384
Listen, mister... Sir...

266
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,597
This is none of our
business. We won't...

267
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,515
You won't what?

268
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,560
This is none of our business.

269
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,354
It's a private matter.

270
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:10,068
Right. Right, and we won't
say anything to anybody.

271
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,155
Well, I don't know.
Frank, you believe them?

272
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,577
Yeah. You know, I
think maybe I could.

273
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,163
Yeah, well, I don't.

274
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, you should. 'Cause we really
don't... We really don't give a shit.

275
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,003
Hey, Paige, calm down.

276
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,758
I swear... I mean, we swear that
we won't... We won't tell any...

277
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,677
Paige. Oh, my God!

278
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,056
We have thin walls, okay.
Oh, my... Please don't.

279
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,481
Please just... Please, just put the
knife down. You can have my keys.

280
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,110
I don't care. Just don't
hurt her. Thanks, Mari.

281
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,695
Just don't...

282
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,824
Please...

283
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,787
Okay, sir, can we
please just go now?

284
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,706
Paige... Please...

285
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,916
Do you not like us, Paige?

286
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,129
I'm sorry, ladies.
We just can't risk it.

287
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,633
What? No! No, but...

288
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,803
Why can't you just...
Please, just let us go!

289
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,847
Paige, just stay calm.

290
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,974
God damn it!

291
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,228
Somebody... Oh, God.

292
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,897
Please... Fuck!

293
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,483
Somebody, please! No!

294
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,776
Don't fucking move.

295
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,364
Somebody help!

296
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,409
Somebody! Help me!

297
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,077
Please!

298
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,413
Somebody help me!

299
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:46,998
Help! Somebody!

300
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,923
Hey! What...

301
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,514
Anything? No. No,
we're still okay.

302
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,061
Francis! What the fuck!

303
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,272
She's taking a nap.
But she'll come around.

304
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,567
I hate cell phones.

305
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,905
Everywhere you turn, nothing but
texting and yakking and texting.

306
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,163
I hate them.

307
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,250
Load up.

308
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,302
Justin.

309
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,847
I'm sorry. They weren't
supposed to be back.

310
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,352
What?

311
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,106
That's your excuse?

312
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,441
Yes, sir.

313
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,325
Justin.

314
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,415
You gotta start putting other
people's needs ahead of your own.

315
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,584
You knew not to bring anybody
back here, but you did it anyway.

316
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,086
Didn't you?
Because I thought...

317
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,089
Because we weren't
supposed to be here.

318
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,053
Well, you did it.
It can't be undone.

319
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,891
Now you're gonna take
responsibility for that action.

320
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,687
It's as simple as that.
You know how we do that?

321
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,106
Look at her.

322
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,403
Just look at her. God.
Would you just let them...

323
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,531
Look at her!

324
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,080
That's a good start.

325
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,660
Put your seatbelt on.

326
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,676
Hell.

327
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,639
We're okay.

328
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,558
You're okay.

329
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,023
Now I go left, right?

330
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,696
Looks like that road that's
over the mountain is left.

331
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,365
Right takes you
back to the lake.

332
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,783
Go left.

333
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,623
I've been coming here for years.
You're looking for Highway 43,

334
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:42,001
the two-lane that goes
over the mountains. Right?

335
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,795
I guess that's the one, Mari.

336
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,922
Then you need to go left.

337
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,561
Thanks for the clarity, Mari.

338
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,072
Thanks for being so
cooperative, Mari.

339
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,908
What good would
it do me not to be?

340
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,913
I always took your kind to be
whiny little fucking bitches

341
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,458
born with silver spoons
up their asses, but you,

342
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,961
I think maybe there's
hope for you, Mari.

343
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:32,176
I don't know, Krug. I think Mari here
has some potential you should consider.

344
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,678
Krug, what do you think?

345
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,431
I think she's been a cool
customer ever since the motel.

346
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,267
He agrees.

347
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,536
Oh, my God!

348
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,341
Come on!

349
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,093
You get the fuck...

350
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,516
Handle it!

351
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,853
Dad, watch out!

352
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,254
Shit.

353
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,308
Motherfucker.

354
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,067
You bitch.

355
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,953
Sadie, you okay?

356
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,872
Do I look
O-fucking-kay? Fuck!

357
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,586
Oh, no. No, no, no.

358
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:16,048
This is gonna scar.
It's gonna scar forever!

359
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,595
Well, then you should let her
know how you feel about that.

360
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,307
Yeah!

361
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,894
Fuck!

362
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,402
You bitch!

363
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,405
Fuck you!

364
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,283
Fucking bitch, you
burned my fucking face!

365
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,285
Why the fuck did you do that?

366
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,245
Oh, my God! Mari!

367
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,538
Damn it! Fuck!

368
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,832
Mari! Paige, run!

369
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,543
Come here!

370
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,378
Bring her back!

371
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,106
Help!

372
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,610
Somebody!

373
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,281
Help me! Help!

374
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,289
Get back here,
you stupid cunt!

375
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,458
Come on back, Paige!

376
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,086
No!

377
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,421
Stop!

378
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,507
Please.

379
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,987
Hey, Paige!

380
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,119
Paige!

381
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,039
Fuck!

382
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,949
Help! Somebody!

383
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,953
Help me! Somebody
help me! Help me!

384
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,044
Please help me! No!

385
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,521
No.

386
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,314
No?

387
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,445
Krug says he wants
us to bring her back.

388
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,665
Get up!

389
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,999
Now what?

390
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,021
You ready to be a man?

391
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,691
What?

392
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,367
Pick one. Or both.

393
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,747
What are you doing?

394
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,127
No, no, no.

395
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,294
No!

396
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,255
Come on. Grab her.

397
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,716
Hold on!

398
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:14,304
I'm teaching you a lesson,
son! Just... Come on.

399
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,183
Jesus, just like
that. Look at that.

400
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,105
Come here.

401
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,235
Yeah. See? Let's get
him all worked up.

402
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,113
Get him all worked
up and tingling.

403
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,158
There.

404
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,249
What's the matter with you!

405
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,338
Never gonna get
easier than this!

406
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,174
You're pathetic!

407
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,469
What'd you say, Paige?

408
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,890
Where did that come
from all of a sudden?

409
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,313
My goodness. Come here.

410
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,859
Are you gonna hit me now?

411
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,361
No, honey, not hit.

412
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,407
No!

413
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,458
No! No! No!

414
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,021
Paige!

415
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:01,078
You think I'm pathetic, Paige?
Look at my fucking kid here!

416
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,336
Well, Mari, looks like
she's in a lot of pain.

417
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,925
Get that hair
out of her mouth.

418
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:20,347
Tell her everything's gonna be
okay. Tell her help's on the way.

419
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,684
Tell her it's not
as bad as it looks.

420
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,814
Do it. She needs you!

421
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,315
I won't!

422
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,196
God damn it! Leave me alone!

423
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,534
No.

424
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,246
Don't! Don't do this!

425
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,791
You think you can fuck
with me whenever you want?

426
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,085
She doesn't think so, see.

427
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,211
Come on.

428
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,508
She's a liar.

429
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,063
Look around.
Look what she did.

430
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,485
No! No! No! No!

431
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,322
No! You hear that?

432
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,124
No!

433
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,596
No, please! Please...

434
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,771
Jesus Christ!

435
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,194
Justin, please.

436
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,906
No. You stay right
there, Justin.

437
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,202
Please!

438
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,288
Please, please, please...

439
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,479
What is that? You want that?

440
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,274
Is that what you want?

441
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,484
No!

442
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,165
You missed out.

443
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,740
I swim.

444
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,702
What, sweetie?
We can't hear you.

445
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,871
I love to swim.

446
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,790
We're happy for you.

447
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:04,422
I can do it one more...

448
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:05,882
One more time for what?

449
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,115
Shit.

450
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,700
You got her.

451
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,280
Come on! Justin!

452
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,935
Thanks for cooking,
honey. It's good.

453
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,188
It's a team effort.

454
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,109
Sit down. Stay with me.

455
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,531
Okay. Sorry.

456
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,294
Hello!

457
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,755
There's been an accident.

458
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,303
This is gonna
hurt. One, two...

459
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,348
Shit!

460
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:28,686
Shit!

461
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,692
Okay. The worst part's over.

462
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,861
Just try and breathe
normally, okay? Deep breath.

463
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,321
Deep breath, deep breath.

464
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:43,034
I was just saying that despite everything,
we're having a pretty lucky day.

465
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,160
Seeing your house...

466
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:49,874
It's so beautiful. This kitchen
is just so squeaky clean.

467
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,671
And you being a
doctor, of course.

468
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:58,967
Yeah, an ill-equipped one. You guys
should still go to the hospital.

469
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:03,096
Well, we don't really have the
best health coverage right now.

470
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,015
Well, they still
have to treat you.

471
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,309
Well, in that case,
can we bum a ride?

472
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,229
Sure, there's
only one problem.

473
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,899
Our daughter won't have the car
back till tomorrow morning. So...

474
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,362
Thank you, Mrs. Collingwood.

475
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,613
It's Emma.

476
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,866
Thank you. You're welcome.

477
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,703
Justin, sweetie, would you
like some hot chocolate?

478
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:31,291
Well, if he doesn't, it'll be a
first. What do you say, Justin?

479
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,628
Yeah?

480
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,464
Yes, please. Okay.

481
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,469
Hold on to this.
Keep the pressure on.

482
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,556
Say, you think I could
use your landline?

483
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,224
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

484
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,226
It's right there on
the wall. Here you go.

485
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:54,147
I gotta call us a tow truck and
maybe a cab to take us into town.

486
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,983
Are you sure that's
a good idea, Krug?

487
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,405
I mean, do they
even have taxis here?

488
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,240
Yeah, they do.

489
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:07,410
Good luck getting one to
come out here in this weather.

490
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,914
Well, they might,
honey. You never know.

491
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,167
Yeah, you never know, do you?

492
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,170
Yellow Pages are in
this drawer over here.

493
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:19,923
Justin.

494
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,560
Okay, Francis, here we go.

495
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,855
One second.

496
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,111
Shit.

497
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,696
Hold still.

498
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,378
Shit, you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

499
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,630
Hey, Doc. Doc,
where's the needle?

500
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,841
Don't move, okay? Don't move.

501
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,760
Yeah, don't worry.

502
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,763
That phone's dead, too.

503
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,642
Yeah, it happens every time.
I'll just turn the generator on.

504
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,560
Sit tight, everyone.

505
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,378
So, you guys live
here permanently?

506
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,172
Oh, no, no, no. We
actually live in the city.

507
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,466
How many houses do you have?

508
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,515
So, what are you guys
doing out here anyway?

509
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,727
I mean, this is kind of
in the middle of nowhere.

510
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,146
Are you on a family
vacation or...

511
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,488
Well, it's kind of
embarrassing actually.

512
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:13,369
My dad used to take Francis and
me to this lake every summer.

513
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:16,706
Do some fishing,
a little camping...

514
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,500
But now that he's gone,

515
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,046
those memories are all that
I really have left of him,

516
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,425
and, basically, I'm just trying to
do the same thing for Justin here.

517
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,474
I think that's important.
It's nice, making memories.

518
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,730
Don't know if I want
to remember today.

519
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:46,819
You might. You never know. I mean,
you're all safe. You're together.

520
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,614
That's what counts.

521
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,492
Amen, Emma. Amen.

522
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,208
Well, okay.

523
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:47,547
Would you mind holding this for
me? Just hold it on his face.

524
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,717
You all right? All
right, here we go.

525
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,011
Okay, just hold still.

526
00:57:58,767 --> 00:57:59,767
God.

527
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,730
That fucking hurts!

528
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,195
Man up, Frank.

529
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,906
Fuck you. God.

530
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,538
Here you go, sweetheart.

531
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,624
Thank you.

532
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,501
And we're done.

533
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,504
You better not be lying, Doc.

534
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,256
I just have to
clean it off first.

535
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,552
Hey, Em, would you get the antiseptic
cream out of the drawer over there?

536
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,847
It's gonna sting. What?

537
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,018
Jesus, okay! I know. It's
okay. You're doing good. Okay.

538
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,607
That's it. You're done.

539
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,901
That's good.

540
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,236
Thank you, Emma.

541
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,867
Sure.

542
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,955
I'll... I'll get
you a coffee, too.

543
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,792
Got anything stronger?

544
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,570
Nothing.

545
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,281
Yeah, I figured.

546
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:39,992
Looks like we're
still stuck here.

547
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,374
Justin, are you okay?

548
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,670
I've just never seen
him like this before.

549
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,631
Well, maybe you
should lie down.

550
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,262
You know, you should probably
just sleep here tonight.

551
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:03,015
Well, no, we couldn't do that.

552
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,395
I don't think you
have much choice.

553
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:10,231
We just don't want
to impose, is all.

554
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:15,361
Well, it's really not a problem.
We have a guest house. So...

555
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:20,032
Whatever you think.
Whatever's easiest.

556
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,328
Yeah, we're very easy.

557
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:33,296
Where's the bathroom?

558
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,549
It's the last door on
the right. Down the hall.

559
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,595
Kitchen counter's fine.

560
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,266
That's our daughter, Mari.

561
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,685
The car thief.

562
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,439
Sorry... I'm...

563
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,195
Justin, honey?
Justin, honey...

564
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,782
Are you okay? What's
wrong? I'm fine. I'm fine.

565
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,222
Hey, Justin, Dr. Collingwood
wants to know if you're doing okay.

566
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:09,392
Yeah, tell him I'm fine.

567
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:16,440
You keep your mouth shut, do you
hear me? Don't you fuck up again.

568
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,652
H urry up.

569
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,983
The neighborhood boys would try to jump
over our fence and steal our fruit...

570
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:06,198
The dog would chase them out,
but my mom was scared of the dog.

571
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,284
She took him to the pound.

572
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,066
We're being shown to our room.

573
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,406
So, the bathroom is in there.

574
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:32,076
And there should be some
stuff in the medicine cabinet

575
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,037
in case Justin starts
to feel sick again.

576
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:39,542
But other than that, I think
we're pretty well-covered.

577
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:43,587
So, unless you guys can think of
anything else, then I'll let you...

578
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:45,673
Let you get your rest.

579
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,385
Emma, please. You've
done more than enough.

580
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,263
Go. Get some sleep
for goodness sakes.

581
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:58,185
Well, if you decide that you do need
anything, please don't hesitate to...

582
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:02,648
Well, you can't really call,
but I guess just come over.

583
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,066
Will do.

584
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,236
Good night.

585
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,321
Good night. Good night.

586
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,156
Good night, Emma.

587
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,837
I think she likes me.

588
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,741
You get them all
squared away down there?

589
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,452
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,997
They're just so weird.

591
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:04,084
Did you lock the
front door? No.

592
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:07,713
I got it. Why don't you pour
us the rest of that wine?

593
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,896
Em? Yeah?

594
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,565
Did you hear that?

595
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,865
Where's it coming from?

596
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,743
Sounds like it's
coming from the porch.

597
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,475
Mari!

598
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,061
Oh, my God!

599
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,404
Okay, baby. I
got you. Sweetie.

600
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:16,782
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. John.

601
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,953
She's been shot! We
gotta get her inside.

602
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:29,420
Hold her head. Hold her head. Give
me some room. Give me some room.

603
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,593
John, is she breathing? Baby?

604
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,804
Come on, girl, let's go.

605
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:41,473
John, come on!

606
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:47,104
Fuck! Oh, my God!

607
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:51,191
No, no, no. That's
it. All right.

608
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,318
Come on, Mari.
Can you hear me?

609
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,571
Mommy and Daddy are with you,
okay? You're gonna be okay.

610
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,364
I gotta stop this
bleeding. Go get me a knife.

611
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,908
John, what about the bullet? Stopping
the bleeding is more important

612
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,327
than fishing for a fucking
bullet! Get me a knife now!

613
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,508
John. John!

614
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:22,014
And lots of towels, all right?
Whatever alcohol we have in there.

615
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:02,179
Okay, sweet pea. This isn't gonna feel
good, but it's gotta be done. Okay?

616
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:12,231
That's it, that's it, baby
girl. I know, baby, I know.

617
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,857
Almost done.

618
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,071
Almost done. Okay.

619
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,408
That's it, that's
it. Brave girl.

620
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,620
Okay, all done. That's it.

621
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,690
Oh, God.

622
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,110
You fucker.

623
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,739
Mari? What's
that? What's that?

624
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,201
I can't breathe. Okay, okay.
I'm gonna fix it, all right?

625
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:09,079
That's easy, honey, all right.
Okay, I'm just gonna turn you over.

626
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,956
That's my baby.
Just one second.

627
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:16,628
Emma! I need a glass
of water, quick!

628
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,802
There we go. Okay.
Just for a minute.

629
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,556
Mama's right here,
honey. That's it.

630
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:30,350
Mama's here, honey.

631
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,689
John, be careful. Okay.

632
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:39,568
All right, sweet pea, now this
is gonna hurt a little bit, okay?

633
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,653
But I promise you, you're
gonna breathe better.

634
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,114
All right, here we go. Ready?
One... It's okay, baby. It's okay.

635
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,824
...two, three.

636
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,619
I know. I know, sweetie,
you're almost there.

637
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,330
I just need to let
a little air out.

638
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,750
That's it. That's
my girl. Okay.

639
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,295
Okay, sweetheart.
Okay, that's it, baby.

640
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,506
Hang on one sec. Just
gotta equalize the pressure.

641
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:05,469
Okay, all right. That's it.

642
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,971
It's okay, honey.
Just breathe.

643
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:12,225
Okay, there we go.
That's it, there you go.

644
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:16,396
That's it, baby.
There you go. Okay.

645
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,485
Is that better? Now you can
breathe. That's all better now.

646
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:26,782
That's my girl. There you
go. Yeah. It's okay, baby.

647
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,670
Can you tell me who
did this to you, huh?

648
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:42,881
Did you see him, sweetie?

649
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,343
John?

650
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,137
She's doing okay. She's stable. I
don't know how long it's gonna be,

651
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,472
but we gotta get
her to a hospital.

652
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,974
John. What?

653
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,435
This was in the kitchen.

654
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,939
Okay. Why? The kid.

655
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,901
That kid put it there.

656
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,571
John, Mari was wearing
this when she left.

657
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,574
She was wearing this
when she left today.

658
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,504
Fuck.

659
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:26,967
Em.

660
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,597
Em, she was raped.

661
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,100
No.

662
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,562
No! No! There's blood...

663
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,648
I'm so sorry.

664
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:43,316
Motherfuckers!

665
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:47,362
John, John, I've should've
seen it. I should have realized.

666
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:50,615
He was just standing there looking at
her. He looked like a goddamn ghost,

667
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:54,578
he just was staring at her picture
on the fridge. Fucking knew it!

668
01:12:56,664 --> 01:13:00,542
We are going to get her to a hospital,
okay? We are going to do this.

669
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:01,626
They're still here.

670
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:05,338
What if they come over here... You're
right. I know. I know. You're right.

671
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:09,301
Which means we gotta
be ready. For anything.

672
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:15,307
We have to be ready to
do anything. You hear me?

673
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,226
Yeah.

674
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,300
We don't have...
We don't have a car.

675
01:13:21,301 --> 01:13:24,191
I mean, the nearest house
is six miles from here.

676
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:26,443
How are we... By land.

677
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:31,031
Six miles by land, okay?
We're gonna do this.

678
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:35,744
I need you with me.
We are going to do it.

679
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,872
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

680
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,499
Come on, sweetie.

681
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:46,088
All right, I need some tape. I gotta
tape... I gotta secure this tube. Okay.

682
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,373
You awake in there?

683
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,173
Shit!

684
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,888
Come here, baby. It's
okay. It's okay. It's okay.

685
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,517
It's gonna be okay. We're
leaving very soon, I promise.

686
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,314
Em, where are the boat keys?

687
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,055
Hey.

688
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,225
Sorry, I thought
you'd be asleep by now.

689
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,572
John's asleep.

690
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:44,284
I'm the... I'm the night owl.

691
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,289
Yeah, that last
lightning bolt woke me up.

692
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:54,127
Thought maybe a cold beer
might help. Knock me back out.

693
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,172
Do you mind? No,
wait. Wait, wait, wait.

694
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:01,009
I...

695
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:07,098
I don't think a beer's
gonna cut it, you know.

696
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,769
Not on a night
like this anyway.

697
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:18,276
Well, what's gonna cut
it, Mrs. Collingwood?

698
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:23,573
Well, I was thinking
of maybe a more...

699
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:27,744
A more adult beverage.

700
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,165
We fall into that category?

701
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,127
Yeah, I think so.

702
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:43,510
All right, bartender. I guess I'll
have another hit of that whiskey then.

703
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,180
John just polished that off.

704
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:49,557
Really?

705
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,560
That's impressive.

706
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:56,481
So, he must be... He's
passed out upstairs.

707
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,364
You a wine drinker?

708
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,158
I guess I am tonight.

709
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:09,369
Yeah.

710
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,747
Here, let me go find one.

711
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,561
So, is that rain
letting up any?

712
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:39,190
No, not much. I think the
storm's gonna be here awhile.

713
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,116
So, you not finding
a good bottle?

714
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:53,955
No, I... No, actually,

715
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:57,542
I have one open in the
fridge. Let me just go get it.

716
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,807
Here you go.

717
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,774
Should I just chug it?

718
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,405
God, I'm sorry.
Glasses, right.

719
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:36,122
Here, let me just pour
that for you. All right.

720
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:47,091
You know, I can't thank you
enough for your hospitality.

721
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:54,015
Well, you know, it's...
It's the least we could do.

722
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:17,580
So, I noticed
you had a hot tub.

723
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,292
You get to use that much?

724
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,712
No. Not too much lately.

725
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:37,517
Of course, there's a fire.
It could use some stoking.

726
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,940
Now that sounds
like a fine idea.

727
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,112
I'll get the wine.
I'll meet you in there.

728
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:10,091
Son of a bitch!

729
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,544
You fucking bitch!

730
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:49,380
Who the fuck are you?

731
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,570
Krug!

732
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:16,199
Krug! Sadie!

733
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:18,785
Shit.

734
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,755
Get off me!

735
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,115
Shit!

736
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,081
Jesus Christ!

737
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,866
Who are you crazy fucks?

738
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,822
Fuck me, Francis.

739
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,145
Hang on sweetheart, okay?

740
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:15,399
We might have to do this
a different way, all right?

741
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,543
Come on out, you
piece of shit!

742
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:46,764
What are the odds, man?

743
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,157
Of course, your little girl
had a lot to do with it.

744
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,827
You should be proud.

745
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:13,332
How'd you make us anyway?

746
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,296
Did my fucking kid rat us out?

747
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:26,303
That's it, isn't
it? My fucking kid!

748
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:34,144
He figured out who you were
and blabbered his brains.

749
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:39,691
Hey, by the way, you all did
a bang-up job on my brother.

750
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,486
He is really fucking
dead down there.

751
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:30,701
Well, well. What's this?

752
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,705
This Emma down
here by the lake?

753
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:38,333
You two planning a
daring escape at sea, huh?

754
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:19,166
No! Emma!

755
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:47,694
Did you find them?

756
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:12,844
That hurt?

757
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:16,181
Give you a hand!

758
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,410
You should have seen yourself.

759
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:42,082
Come on, is that
all you got for me?

760
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:47,921
I was expecting a lot more
fight out of you, John.

761
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:54,344
Mari and her little friend
sure gave me a lot of fight.

762
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:28,712
You wanna hear
what I did to Mari?

763
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:34,301
I bet you do, pervert.

764
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:46,229
You want to hear how tight your
little homecoming queen was?

765
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:57,991
No, I want to hear you
beg for your fucking life.

766
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,835
I don't feel like
begging today.

767
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,115
What are you doing?

768
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,580
Ending this.

769
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:51,294
Well, you sure picked a hell
of a time to grow some balls.

770
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:56,133
Glad to see you, too.

771
01:40:57,802 --> 01:41:02,222
Look, I'm not mad, all right?
Just don't do anything stupid.

772
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:13,984
My son.

773
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,988
I loved you.

774
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:21,074
I took care of you!

775
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,660
Loved?

776
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,997
You don't get to talk now!

777
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:29,124
Fuck you!

778
01:45:16,268 --> 01:45:17,435
Hi.

779
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:20,230
What is this?

780
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:23,233
I can't move.

781
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:30,365
You're paralyzed
from the neck down.

782
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,745
I didn't have any
rope or duct tape.

783
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:44,045
What are you doing?

784
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:46,089
Doc?

785
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,559
What the fuck are you doing?

786
01:46:07,403 --> 01:46:09,446
You're gonna be fine.

787
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:10,739
Wait.

788
01:46:13,284 --> 01:46:14,451
Hey.

789
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:16,661
Wait.
