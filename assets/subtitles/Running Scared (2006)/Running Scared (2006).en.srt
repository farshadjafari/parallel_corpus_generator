00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,236
Come on... Come on, kid!

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,115
Don't... fuck...

4
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,550
We're gonna make it. Fuck!

5
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,996
Come on, Oleg. Stay with me!

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,231
Come on!

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,071
I'm not sure we're gonna make it.

8
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:23,309
We're gonna crash!

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,356
We're good.

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,553
It's all looking very good.

11
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,874
Nobody fucking moves!
Get down on the ground.

12
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:25,678
- Get down.
- Now, you cocksuckers!

13
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,954
You heard him! Get down!

14
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,871
You're making the biggest fucking mistake...

15
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,516
Shut up! Down, motherfuckers!
Down!

16
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:34,319
Down!
Everybody! Eat the fucking floor!

17
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,674
Now, very fucking carefully

18
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:41,230
Reach into your jackets and take out
whatever you're packing

19
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,276
and slide it under the bed.
-Fuck you...

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,636
<i>Come on! All of you! Move it!</i>

21
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:48,712
Come on, fuckheads! Keep it moving. Now!

22
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,835
You better spend it real quick, shit bags.

23
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:53,876
<i>You ain't long for this fucking world</i>

24
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,679
Yeah, right,
I’ll be sure to have a Mai Tai on you.

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,756
On all you goombah fucks.

26
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,796
Ja, man. I’ll have one on you too.

27
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,110
- Go, go, go! Come on!
- Move! Move! Move!

28
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,631
Hurry up! Fucking move!

29
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,472
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

30
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,118
<i>Come on</i>

31
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:12,428
<i>Come on!
Now!</i>

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,188
Motherfucker!

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,638
No, man.

34
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,470
We don't give a fuck about these niggers.

35
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,189
Now, you spill Perello blood,
you're deep six invested.

36
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,269
Walk clean.

37
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,237
Piss on Perello blood. Fuck him!

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,669
I don't think so.

39
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,311
Son of a bitch!

40
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,988
<i>I don't give up you fuck!</i>

41
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,959
What? Where you going, you fuck?
We can work this out. Let's talk.

42
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,917
Fuck you!

43
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,916
Shut...the fuck up!

44
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,432
Where the fuck you reaching? Huh?

45
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:51,509
Please...

46
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,068
Tell you what, have a Mai Tai on me, huh?

47
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,836
Fuck me. He's a cop!

48
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,071
<i>A fucking cop!</i>

49
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,037
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

50
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:10,076
Get the shit and let's go. Now!

51
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,396
Hurry the fuck up!

52
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,957
<i>Fucking dirty mooks</i>

53
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:20,268
Fucks

54
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:23,318
Is there one fucking honest cop
in this fucking city?

55
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,392
Joey.

56
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,638
Give me your gun.

57
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,433
Take this shit and get rid of it,
and do me a favor.

58
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,476
Don't fuck it up.

59
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,596
Move!

60
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,396
Never, dickwad!

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,316
Sorry. Are you OK?

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,474
Oh, shit. I didn't mean to do that.

63
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,716
Hey, boss.

64
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,632
You whacking off to the E channel again? Huh?

65
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,158
Just wanna smell you. Just like that.

66
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:04,832
You didn't call, you son of a bitch.

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,639
Let me guess.
My pearls you've been promising?

68
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,636
It’s nothing, just a little recycling.

69
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,755
Joey, come on.

70
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,229
If Tommy ever found out about that...

71
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:33,469
Sshh.

72
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,472
Just remember,
it's just our little insurance policy, all right?

73
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,633
Cos there's no way in hell I’m gonna be
thinking about getting some of this...

74
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:43,678
looking at you through some glass window.
There's no fucking way.

75
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,790
Now, Joey, come on. No, no, no, no

76
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,628
No. No!

77
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,472
Come on, baby. Baby, look at me.

78
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:20,959
- What?
- Nicky's around.

79
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,474
Nicky's busy.
I’ll be quick and real quiet, come on.

80
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,994
Quiet? I don't think so. Quick, i can believe.

81
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,432
- You know something, Mrs. G?
- What?

82
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,431
You're bad.

83
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,476
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,956
- I’ve got a rep.
- Yeah? You got a rep?

85
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,472
You got a cruisey rep?

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,560
I heard she likes to make it
on washing machines.

87
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,551
On select occasions. What else?

88
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,672
Oh, no, no, no. My sauce!

89
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:50,149
- My sauce is burning!
- Wait, that's how i like it!

90
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,593
Yeah.

91
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,237
<i>- Fuck! Come on!
- Hey!</i>

92
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,079
You use language like that,
you ain't getting no after-dinner dessert.

93
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,718
Go find Nicky.
I think he's up in the bedroom with Oleg.

94
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:06,554
Why's he always with that Russky kid?
Don't he have no other friends?

95
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,712
Joey, you know, they get along. it's fine.
What do you want?

96
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,553
I don't want him going over there no more.
That's what I want.

97
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,596
I know. He knows.

98
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,676
He knows.

99
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,436
I’ll go get him.

100
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,716
Yo, Nick. Dinner.

101
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,636
- Oh, shit.

102
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,316
Come on.

103
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,952
Get down.

104
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,476
Dinner.

105
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,559
Can Oleg stay?

106
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,997
It’s already been three times this week.

107
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,116
I’m sure his mom would like to have him home.

108
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,589
It’s OK. I’m not even hungry.

109
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,156
I’ll see you tomorrow. Go Razors.

110
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,190
You, go wash up. Those hands are scary.

111
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,717
Good night, Oleg.

112
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,199
Good night, Mrs. Gazelle.

113
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,153
He's not even up there.

114
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,198
They turned the basement
into a sports complex again.

115
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:17,989
- How many times am I supposed to tell him?
- What do you want? They're just boys.

116
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,352
Dad, I won't do it again, I swear.

117
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:32,158
Don't you expect me to make book on that.

118
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,151
Now, go get your grandfather.

119
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,196
I just washed my hands.

120
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,108
All right.

121
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,156
Hey, Nick.

122
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,477
Razors and Blues Friday night. 1 20 yellow, pal.

123
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,516
No way!

124
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,874
It’s gonna be a death match
between Chester and Erlich!

125
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:57,552
They're going home in body bags!

126
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,596
Red ice!

127
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:01,318
Hey, can Oleg come?

128
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,277
He's never been to one game, and he's...

129
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,828
Not this time.
Sal could only score me a pair of tickets.

130
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,512
Maybe next time, though.

131
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,876
Go get your grandfather.

132
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,713
Come on, man. Make it different this time.

133
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,036
Get up.

134
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,956
Get up.

135
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,156
I said, get up!

136
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:58,310
What is this?

137
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,311
Wolfgang Puck. It's your favorite.

138
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,356
It’s thick crust, you damn blyad.

139
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,110
I cut off crust for you. It will be better.

140
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,796
Bring me out a Moskova.

141
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,157
Hey. Hey.

142
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,278
Come here.

143
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,316
<i>Come here</i>

144
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,956
<i>Come</i>

145
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,356
Watch this.

146
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,836
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

147
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,593
I don't like cowboys.

148
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,636
Come on.

149
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,676
It’s the Duke.

150
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:50,512
Come, sit.

151
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,596
When I was growing up in Kishinev

152
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:06,672
we had no VHS, no DVD back then.

153
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,436
I remember...

154
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:12,717
I did a job for this friend of my father.

155
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,353
I pick-pocketed a key off this apparatchik.

156
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:22,879
The man gave me as a reward
this children's projector.

157
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,916
it came with three films.

158
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,910
Speedy Gonzales, Tarzan Of The Apes,
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

159
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,312
I watched that thing a thousand times.

160
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,116
Anzor, it's getting cold.

161
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,316
I was nine years old.

162
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,553
I didn't know how long movies
were supposed to be.

163
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:56,349
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 10 minutes long.

164
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:59,000
No John Wayne getting shot.

165
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,279
Because it was for kids, they left that part out.

166
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,477
I didn't know this...until I arrive in America

167
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,836
and see it on TV for the first time.

168
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,711
I hate it. I want my 8mm back.

169
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,314
Because on that one, the Duke lives.

170
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,910
Some things were better in the old place.

171
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,756
Not too many. Some things.

172
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,996
Let me show you from the beginning.

173
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,916
No, no, no. Not forward.

174
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,236
This part's better.

175
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,356
Without the Duke?

176
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,632
Where are you going?

177
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:04,676
You don't walk out on the Duke!

178
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,196
Govnyak!

179
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,872
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work,

180
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:16,916
and she wants to get him tested.

181
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,434
She wants to get him tested? Tested for what?

182
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:23,751
I think maybe err...attention disorder
or something.

183
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,353
I’m not fucking ADD.

184
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:27,749
Hey! You don't use that word
in front of your mother.

185
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,673
- What's wrong with ADD?
- The other one, smartass.

186
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,199
He don't use that word, period.

187
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,033
I don't wanna be on medication.
You can't make me take it.

188
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:40,989
Don't even worry about it. There's no way in hell
anybody's gonna put you on meds, OK?

189
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,152
Tell that teacher to come to the rink
and watch him wax that puck.

190
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:47,789
- That's perfect concentration every time.
- That's different, Joe.

191
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,792
We're just trying to find out
what's going on with you.

192
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,552
She said some great things too.

193
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,791
She said that he's very bright,
that he's very creative.

194
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,236
You left that part out before. I like that part.

195
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:01,276
I got potential.

196
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,672
You taking a collection down there?

197
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,956
He must eat.

198
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,395
The little prick insults the Duke...

199
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,276
..he don't eat in this house.

200
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,589
You hear me, you little snot face?

201
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,318
Stay in your room!

202
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,356
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!

203
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,632
<i>Faggot!</i>

204
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,356
He's a growing boy.

205
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,036
What did I fucking say, Sukka?

206
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,836
He has to eat, Anzor.

207
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,353
Please.

208
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:31,432
Who puts food on this fucking table?

209
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,916
Not you, blyad.

210
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,791
I’m the big man of this house.

211
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,792
When I say the little shit don't eat, he don't eat.

212
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,836
Anzor.

213
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,357
John Wayne was a faggot.

214
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,314
So Vicki Gilleto told me she saw you walking
hand in hand with Jeannie's daughter.

215
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,356
- The fat one?

216
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,116
Sounded like a gun.

217
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,076
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

218
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,476
Oh, shit, get down! Get down!

219
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,872
Are you OK? You OK?

220
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,313
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?

221
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,118
Stay here. Motherfucker.

222
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,875
- Motherfucker! I’ll kill that fucking piece of shit.
- Where are you going?

223
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,837
You Russian piece of shit!

224
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,717
Fucking cunt.

225
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,039
Shoot my fucking house.
I’m gonna fucking kill you.

226
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,348
Dad, wait!

227
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:26,874
Get back in the house.
Get back in the house!

228
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,478
Get back in now! Go!

229
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,029
Don't you move.

230
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,189
You piece of shit.

231
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:38,840
- I’m gonna fucking kill you!
-Nick, get inside.

232
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,956
Joe. Joe! What's the matter with you?

233
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,235
I just called 911. Leave it for the cops!

234
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,390
There's a kid in here! Get back in the...

235
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,040
I’m gonna kill you! Open the fucking door!

236
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,076
- Oleg's my friend!
- Get inside.

237
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,390
- Open the door.
- Joey, don't be a damn hero!

238
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,233
Open up! It’s Joey Gazelle from next door!
Open up!

239
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,276
Open up.

240
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,436
Get back. You get back.

241
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,518
Where is he? Is he upstairs?

242
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,953
- His room.
- What?

243
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,996
- His room.
- Get down.

244
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,156
What the fuck?

245
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:17,595
Where's the kid? Huh?

246
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,917
- Where's the kid?
- Fuck him. I’m the one who's shot.

247
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,956
Who is it? Is he still in the house?

248
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,712
The little snot fuck ran out back.

249
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,911
Oleg?

250
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,434
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?

251
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,476
What are you?

252
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,516
A fucking idiot?

253
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,556
I didn't do this to myself.

254
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,230
The little prick would've done me too.

255
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,196
Look at him.

256
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,116
Jesus, it's a fucking miracle.

257
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,670
Where'd he get the fucking piece?

258
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,830
- Fuck should I know?
- What, it wasn't yours?

259
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,876
No! No way!

260
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,034
I got a .357 in the safe out back.

261
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,876
He had some fucking snub-nose thing.

262
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,035
Silver. Chrome.

263
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,350
Bullshit! Now you tell me.
I’m not playing around.

264
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,113
We saw where you put the gun
but he didn't take anything.

265
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:58,555
- Not with me.
- Well, he went back, Nicky.

266
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,995
I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.

267
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,470
Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me.

268
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,596
That piece? That's not just any hot piece.

269
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:09,592
- Tommy used it to burn a dirty cop.
- Oh, no. Joe...

270
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:12,513
Yeah. Listen.
On top of it, that kid's out there right now.

271
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:17,355
The cops are on their way. If they find the gun,
or they find the kid and he talks, I’m dead.

272
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,356
- Fuck!
- Calm down. Calm down.

273
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,158
Calm down. We can get to him.

274
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:25,152
- You can get to the gun before the cops do.
- Oh, shit.

275
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,638
Hey.

276
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,475
- Where are you gonna take him?
- Memorial.

277
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,951
Hey, Mila, you should go with him.

278
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:47,112
I’m gonna look for Oleg.
Me and Nicky are gonna go find him, OK?

279
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,634
I’ll get Teresa to stay here
in case he comes back.

280
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,199
- You should go.
- Thanks, Joey.

281
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,918
- Yeah, no problem.
- I’m sorry.

282
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:55,434
We're gonna find him. Don't worry about it.

283
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,109
Motherfuck.

284
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,636
Come on.

285
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,634
Police officers. Sir, do you live here?

286
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:19,676
No. No, actually I live next door.

287
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:22,274
I heard gunshots,
so I came to see what's going on.

288
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,032
- What did you see?
- Err...

289
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,436
I saw Anzor, my neighbor, in the kitchen.
He'd been shot.

290
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:32,273
- See who did it?
-No, he was screaming in Russian.

291
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:34,999
His wife asked me to stick around for the kid.

292
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,036
- You don't know who shot him?
-No.

293
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,716
I’m gonna need to take a statement outside.

294
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,836
I can't have you messing up the scene.

295
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:43,876
Hey, check it out.

296
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,553
I don't see nothing inside.
Maybe all the way back.

297
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,916
Forget it. Leave it for Forensics.

298
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,396
Sir, I need for you to wait outside.

299
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,316
All right. No problem.

300
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,116
I’m fucking having a heart attack.

301
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,349
- Breathe.
- I gotta find this kid. I gotta find this kid tonight.

302
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,638
Nick, I need to know places.
I need to know hideouts.

303
00:24:20,638 --> 00:24:23,393
Go to your room and make a list.
Nick, make a list!

304
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:25,516
- OK.
- I’m not fucking around, Nick.

305
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,670
Joe, just take it easy.

306
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,034
There's no fucking time!

307
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,917
I want you to wait next door.

308
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,956
The second he shows up, call me.

309
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,279
I can't have to keep fucking talking to the cops.

310
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,920
You understand me?
The fucking gun is on the street.

311
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,355
This whole fucking things about to blow up.

312
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:57,910
<i>If Tommy or any of those fucking guys
find out about it I’m a dead man</i>

313
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,956
<i>You gotta fucking help me</i>

314
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,636
Yeah, if I fucking have to.

315
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,911
Grab your jacket. We're going for a ride.

316
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,792
All right, Nick.
I want you to stay in the car, all right?

317
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,552
Don't get out for anything.

318
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:32,679
If I’m not back in one hour, call your mother.
She'll come and get you, OK?

319
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,756
Excuse me.

320
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,636
Who's in the other room?
Is that Yugorsky, gunshot victim?

321
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:01,871
Teenager. DUI car wreck.
I think they just lost a GSW in 3.

322
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,157
Lost?

323
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,117
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

324
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:08,236
No, wait, he took a bullet right here.

325
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:11,153
No, major trauma to chest.
He's been in surgery all day.

326
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,037
The guy was a cop.

327
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:16,556
Oh, wait. Yeah, they did bring someone in
about 40 minutes ago.

328
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,756
OR number 2. He's gone upstairs already.

329
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:19,909
That's this way?

330
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,476
Can I help you, Dr Donaldson?

331
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,437
Yeah, the cops are waiting outside.

332
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,829
They need to run a match on this bullet asap.

333
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,558
I’ll make sure they get it right away.

334
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,356
Excuse me.

335
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,520
You looking for this? Yugorsky? GSW shoulder?

336
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,556
You gotta help me find him, Nick.

337
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,188
- What are you gonna do to him?
- I’m not gonna do nothing.

338
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,919
I just need to get my gun back
and bring him home.

339
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,996
You sure?

340
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,596
Talk to me, Nick.

341
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,193
<i>There's this old abandoned rec centre
in the park</i>

342
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:51,352
<i>Me and Oleg would hang out there sometimes
read comics</i>

343
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,271
<i>He might he there</i>

344
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,237
Nice gun.

345
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,596
Detective Rydell, Narcotics.

346
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,436
I already made a statement.

347
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,116
don't know who the shooter was

348
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,552
Fucking niggers all look the same.

349
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:41,074
Yeah. Anzor Yugorsky.

350
00:28:41,074 --> 00:28:43,116
Any relation to Ivan Yugorsky?

351
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,633
My uncle.

352
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:48,076
The Czar of Brighton Beach.
I’ve been to his club a couple of times.

353
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,479
Nice joint.

354
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,516
He even sang a few songs.

355
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,718
He sings like a fucking toad.

356
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:57,429
Well, Sinatra he's not,
but he's a man with a serious reputation.

357
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,516
- He has a lot of enemies.
- Bullshit.

358
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:04,036
I told you it was just some fucking crack head.

359
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:06,714
Yeah. Well, I spoke to the officers on the scene.

360
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:08,711
There was no sign of forced entry.

361
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:11,360
But they did find some interesting shit out back.

362
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,591
Six cases of Nyquil,
and it ain't even cold season.

363
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:16,955
What do you think a search warrant's
gonna turn up?

364
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,676
- Come on. Where?
- It’s this way.

365
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,396
Let's go. Come on.

366
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,796
Come on.

367
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,356
Go, go, go.

368
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,831
This way.

369
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,878
Be cool. And let me do all the talking.

370
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,476
I’m gonna get you out of here.

371
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,676
- Help you?
- Yeah.

372
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,036
How much you got?

373
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,431
Oh, I got a lot.

374
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,955
Yes.

375
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,916
Oleg, it's Nicky. Are you in there?

376
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,596
- This the spot?
- Mm.

377
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,077
Hey, where's the stash?

378
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,116
Last stall, motherfucker.

379
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,796
Find the stash. Find it.

380
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,996
Go on. Find it.

381
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,996
Find it!

382
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,558
We're gonna search this entire park.
He might still be around.

383
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,275
What the fuck do you think you're doing,
white boy?

384
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:24,716
All right, drop it, or I’ll fucking waste the midget.
Come on!

385
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,395
Go ahead. He's just a tag-along.

386
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:31,438
Plug 'em, Dell. Fuck it, man! Fuck 'em up.

387
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,358
All right, stay right by me.

388
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,112
Right here. Against the wall.

389
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:57,316
Don't you move. Stay right there.

390
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,193
I didn't do nothing, Officer. I just came to...

391
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:06,669
Put your fucking head
against the fucking stall.

392
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:08,591
Put your fucking head there!

393
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,592
Oleg.

394
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,113
I told you to stay outside.

395
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:18,795
- Did you find him?
- Get the fuck outside! Get out of here!

396
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:20,279
I’m talking to you! What did you see?

397
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,437
Find a gun? You find a silver gun?
Did you find a fucking silver gun?

398
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:26,748
I-I-I got no gun.

399
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,509
You wanna study for the GED? Here

400
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,794
Look what you done to my fucking ride, bitch.

401
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,430
Jesus, please, baby. Please.

402
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,633
I’ve only been taking one class.
One class two hours a week.

403
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,756
I still got time to be pulling tricks.

404
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,875
Three Gs I fronted you
for these fucking airbags.

405
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,392
And what do I get in return?

406
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:12,277
- Fucking night school?
- I’ll quit!

407
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,749
I’m super proud of you
for showing some initiative.

408
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,070
Maybe I’ll even come to your graduation.

409
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,311
But first you're gonna give me back
my fucking property.

410
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,393
You learn how to use that
watching Sesame Street?

411
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,836
You ain't even holding it right.

412
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,395
What's the matter, kid? You got the shakes?

413
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,989
Whoops.

414
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,315
Now I’m gonna put a smile on your face, boy.

415
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,678
Cheek to cheek.

416
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:55,149
You're gonna be the happiest little brat
in school.

417
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:56,719
Say cheese.

418
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,155
Who's laughing now, you fucking grey meat
limp-dick motherfucker?

419
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,434
Mac Daddy!

420
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:06,399
Who's mucking now, bitch!

421
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,356
Puñeta!

422
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,557
You got some cojones, kid.

423
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,356
Let me see your fingers, son.

424
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,916
Is this... Hey! Is this your son?

425
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,356
I’m taking care of him tonight, OK?

426
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,515
Unless you have the number of his doctor
and I can get a prescription over the phone,

427
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,272
you'll have to take him to Emergency.

428
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:47,432
- If you want me to call you a cab...
- I don't need no fucking cab!

429
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,033
I need some spray shit for him!

430
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,669
That spray shit is a controlled substance,
ma'am, so what can I tell you?

431
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,518
- Keep the change.
- I can't... This is stupid. I can't do this.

432
00:34:57,518 --> 00:35:00,672
Listen, why don't we go in the back
and talk about it, OK?

433
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,150
- Look, lady...
- I’ll take care of you.

434
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,233
- There's nothing I can do, lady.
- There's nothing you can do?

435
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,595
- Take him to Emergency.
- OK.

436
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:11,908
OK.

437
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,355
Nothing you can fucking do?

438
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,193
Get what he needs. Now.

439
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,911
- It’s Beclovent.
- Yeah, I know.

440
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,035
Beclovent, bitch!

441
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,198
Come on, let's just go back.

442
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:24,599
No.

443
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,716
If he turns up, your mom's gonna call.

444
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:31,710
Tee.

445
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,356
Sal.

446
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:37,351
Yeah.

447
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,431
- Do girls really get naked in there?
- You'll find out when you're 21.

448
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:47,909
I’ve seen Mom naked. It's no big deal.

449
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,711
Trust me on this one. It's always a big deal.

450
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,473
Stay here.

451
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,756
What?

452
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,956
It’s taken care of.

453
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:34,996
Oh. It's taken care of. Lucky us.

454
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,592
<i>Guys sit down Have a seat</i>

455
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:40,636
Don't be shy.

456
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,868
They make a good Mai Tai for a twat bar,
but seriously overpriced.

457
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:48,474
Two million dollars for a round of drinks.

458
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,516
And the pussy ain't even that hot.

459
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,473
Jody, I’m doin' business here.
Jody! Come on, get the fuck out of here.

460
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:57,073
Two million dollars.

461
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:59,879
Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don't have shit on us.

462
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,791
What do you think of this?

463
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:05,555
Cops never found these at the scene.
Just two dead narcs and three dead Jamaicans.

464
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,438
Ballistics is gonna reveal the slugs
that killed my partners

465
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:10,431
didn't come from the Jamaicans.

466
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,511
So there were others involved.

467
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,433
As for myself...erm...I was never there.

468
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,350
Well...

469
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,512
dead guys tell no tales.

470
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:22,910
Yeah. Why don't you ask your pal here?

471
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,518
What the fuck you talking about?

472
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:29,319
You blew my partner Stevie's balls off
with a .38 snub nose.

473
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:31,311
A real distinctive piece.

474
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:34,198
Stainless. Polished up like a spic's hubcap.

475
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,596
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

476
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,669
<i>I think you gave him the gun
to dump in the river</i>

477
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,990
<i>Now I’m assuming that he never
got around to it because two hours ago</i>

478
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,469
<i>his next-door neighbor
took a slug in the shoulder</i>

479
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:50,358
The shooter was the guy's 10-year-old stepson.

480
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:52,795
Who was over at Gazelle's house
two hours earlier.

481
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:55,030
What the fuck you trying to do here? Huh?

482
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,439
You trying to fucking play us?

483
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,750
You're wasting your time, and this is bullshit.

484
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,796
Bullshit? Bullshit, huh?

485
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,636
This punk, Anzor Yugorsky?

486
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:06,188
He describes the gun to me in vivid detail.

487
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:10,034
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.

488
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,390
- The fuck is this guy talking about?
- He's talking about a fucking shiny gun.

489
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,199
Big deal. There's a thousand on the street.
it ain't the piece.

490
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,876
Oh, yeah? What were you doing at the hospital
when they brought Yugorsky in? Huh?

491
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:24,110
<i>Sniffing around Emergency</i>

492
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,519
<i>You know what I figure?</i>

493
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,717
<i>I figure you were there to pull a switch
on the slug they took out of him</i>

494
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:31,712
My wife asked me to go to the hospital.

495
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:33,995
She was concerned, in a neighborly way.
She wanted me...

496
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:37,356
All right, you know what? Enough bullshit.
I expect to find a bag...

497
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,000
in this locker at Down Neck Station by midnight.

498
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,833
If the bag is not there one minute after,

499
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,309
I’m taking you all down any fucking way I can.

500
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:47,436
<i>Even If Ihave to manufacture the case</i>

501
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:51,149
And you know I will.
Cos I got the toughest mob in the world.

502
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:53,196
I’m the law.

503
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,998
Right, stay put. I’m gonna grab you a burger.

504
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:15,629
- I’m not hungry.
- You didn't finish dinner, I’ll grab you something.

505
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:17,676
Stay here.

506
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,398
Dad?

507
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,756
Don't go in there. Let's just go home.

508
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,676
It’s gonna be all right.

509
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,829
No, it's not.

510
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,399
- Hey, Frankie. How you doing?
- Hey. How are ya?

511
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:36,436
- It’s good to see you.
- Sit, Joe.

512
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,071
- How you doin,' guys?
- Hi, Joey.

513
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:40,991
How you doing?

514
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,399
- You want some coffee, or something to eat?
- Nah, I’m good.

515
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:46,118
But I got my boy waiting out in the car.

516
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,634
- I wanna get him a burger.
- Tony, take care of that.

517
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:51,871
Yeah, Tony, get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.

518
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,030
Don't scare him. He don't know you're coming.

519
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,229
<i>So Joe</i>

520
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:02,153
I got off the phone with Ivan
about this thing with his nephew.

521
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:04,674
I told you, it's not the fucking piece.

522
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,190
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain -fried reprobate.

523
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,157
Yeah, whatever. He's a tweaker piece of shit.

524
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,435
And he's cooking meth in his backyard.

525
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:16,353
It’s just a matter of time
before he blows up the neighborhood.

526
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:19,796
We know this.
But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe.

527
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,559
I’m in bed with Yugorsky on this gasoline deal.

528
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:24,390
Hey.

529
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,629
It’s a good deal.

530
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:28,154
- I don't wanna rock the boat.
- Oh, fuck that.

531
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:30,310
Fuck those Russian cunts. Huh?

532
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:34,598
Pop, it's the fucking narc
that's got his dick in our ass.

533
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,591
Hey.

534
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:38,875
<i>Calm down Tommy</i>

535
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,838
You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in his head

536
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:45,912
that maybe you were looking to knock him
out of the cooking business

537
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,911
and helped the boy out.

538
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,479
Made a piece available to him.

539
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,519
I would never use a kid to do something like that.

540
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,315
Never.

541
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:57,356
All right, all right, look.

542
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,194
I need a person to make assurance to the russky

543
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:04,397
that I'll have my entire crew in the street
out looking for that kid.

544
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:07,597
Now, in the interest of professional harmony...

545
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,035
..I think we all wanna get our story straight.

546
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,076
<i>You agree don't you Joe?</i>

547
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,719
One hamburger and you're out of my life.
That's it.

548
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,631
Oleg.

549
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,869
Oh shit!

550
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,439
Hey, kid.

551
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:32,671
How you doing?
Your old man sent this stuff out for you.

552
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:34,193
Thanks.

553
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:38,239
Ain't it a little late for you to be out?
I have twins your age. They're in bed by now.

554
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,709
What are you, like, nine?

555
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,472
Ten.

556
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:43,754
And a half.

557
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,193
I gotta go to the bathroom.

558
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,510
Hey, Joey.

559
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,875
Looks like your kid don't listen too well.

560
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,956
Must run in the family.

561
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,593
Hey, Nicky. Get over here.

562
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:09,636
<i>Get over here</i>

563
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,156
What you doing? I told you to wait in the car.

564
00:42:16,156 --> 00:42:18,754
- I had to go to the bathroom.
- How you doing, Nicky?

565
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:20,831
Want some Gummy Bears?

566
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,797
Hey, Nicky.

567
00:42:22,797 --> 00:42:24,632
You wouldn't by chance...

568
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:26,756
<i>know where your friend got that gun?</i>

569
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:28,319
Would ya?

570
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,152
No.

571
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,758
I have to go to the bathroom.

572
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,796
<i>- OK
-Nick, you go to the bathroom.</i>

573
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,669
Have you decided yet?

574
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:46,433
I have a bus to catch and... Oh, no!

575
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:49,034
I’ll have a cheeseburger and a Coke.

576
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,509
I gotta go to the bathroom.

577
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:53,670
Don't worry, we're gonna take care of the cop.

578
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,716
- I know.
- OK.

579
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,838
Where is it?

580
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,796
Hey, Nick.

581
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,352
- Where the hell are you?
- Almost done.

582
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,868
Razors with razors.

583
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,072
Come on, wash your hands.
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

584
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,193
Fuck!

585
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,355
Hey, sweetie. How you doing?

586
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,718
All right, Nick, listen to me.

587
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:58,155
I want you to think about
where your friend might be,

588
00:43:58,155 --> 00:44:00,834
because the others are looking for him
and if they find him...

589
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:03,115
- They won't find the gun.
- What did you say?

590
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,356
What did you say?

591
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,719
Don't mess with me.
I want you to fucking talk to me now.

592
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,917
- Promise me you won't hurt him.
- I don't have time for this shit.

593
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:17,718
- Now fucking tell me.
- Promise.

594
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:20,792
Promise you what? What? I promise.
I swear to God!

595
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,030
I’m not gonna hurt your friend!
Come on. Tell me.

596
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,111
Just tell me what you know.

597
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,236
Come on.

598
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:54,512
This one here?

599
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,710
Where is it?
I thought you said you put it in there.

600
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,631
- I did. I put it right...
- Then where is it?

601
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:42,349
- I thought you said you put it in the tank.
- I put it in here!

602
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:43,589
Oh, shit.

603
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:46,114
Which one did you put it in, Nick? Huh?

604
00:45:46,114 --> 00:45:48,156
Which one did you put it in?

605
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,916
Goddamn it, Nicky.

606
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,230
Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie to me?

607
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,719
I didn't.

608
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,756
- Why did you lie to me?
- I’m not...

609
00:46:00,756 --> 00:46:03,718
- Why did you lie to me?
- I’m not fucking lying! I put it in there!

610
00:46:03,718 --> 00:46:06,553
You just fucking killed me, Nick.

611
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:08,596
You just fucking killed me!

612
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,479
I want you to keep an eye open.

613
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:57,394
If you see anybody coming,
I want you to cough really loud, all right?

614
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,676
- You're like a broken record.
- I’m telling you, you gotta see this thing.

615
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:13,716
You better not be jerking my chain.

616
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:16,997
- What are you doin' here, kid?
- I was looking for the bathroom.

617
00:47:16,997 --> 00:47:20,390
- Even the kid thinks it's a shithole back here.
- Shut up, Ralphie.

618
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,754
All right, listen.

619
00:47:21,754 --> 00:47:23,239
You go on out through that door,

620
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:25,231
turn left, go all the way down to the end,

621
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:27,072
turn left again, and you're there.

622
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:28,309
You got it?

623
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,314
- Come on.
- Err...which door?

624
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,436
Come here, kid. Come here.

625
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,916
Hey, Yolanda. Wait up!

626
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,672
<i>- Where you going with my cheesecake?
- It’s for paying customers Not you</i>

627
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,718
I’ve got your number, fucker.

628
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,313
Forget it. I ain't dragging your butt
across no state lines.

629
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,036
Look, bubba, why don't you just go home?

630
00:48:16,036 --> 00:48:18,953
I bet you things are not as bad
as you think they are.

631
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,312
Come on, bubba.

632
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,798
Oh, mother...

633
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:35,314
- Hands where we can see 'em!

634
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:36,958
Over here.

635
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:38,996
Run! Run, little man! Run!

636
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,232
Hey.

637
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,036
Get off! Get off!

638
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,076
Do you know these guys?

639
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,196
- Yeah.
- Babe?

640
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,960
<i>- Where the hell are you?
- I’m taking care of things</i>

641
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,838
Forget about it - they picked up Oleg
at a bus station with a hooker.

642
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:33,070
Who picked him up?

643
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,957
- The cops?
- Yeah.

644
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:37,235
Jesus Christ, this is fucking bullshit.

645
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,753
<i>- Hey.
- Fuck!</i>

646
00:49:38,753 --> 00:49:40,592
Hey! You got Nicky with you?

647
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:41,954
Yeah, he's right here.

648
00:49:41,954 --> 00:49:44,395
Then stop using your mouth around him!

649
00:49:44,395 --> 00:49:46,835
And bring my son home! Now!

650
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:50,310
Yeah. That's what I’m doing.
I’m bringing him home right now.

651
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,040
Ah. Do you mind?

652
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,076
I’m feeling kind of parched.

653
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,158
Big game Friday night.

654
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:09,878
I bet you're excited about that, huh?

655
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:13,270
It’s gonna be red ice,
and plenty of blue shirt body bags.

656
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,316
Am I right?

657
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,072
Look...I could help you, kid.

658
00:50:20,072 --> 00:50:21,832
You and your mom, if need be.

659
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:24,309
Now I could get that prick out of your life.

660
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,156
Lock him up. I could do that, I’m a cop.

661
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,715
All you have to do
is tell me where you found the gun.

662
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:33,756
And where you stashed it.

663
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,479
That's it.

664
00:50:36,479 --> 00:50:38,516
What do you say?

665
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:40,556
You'll let me help you.

666
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,116
Get out of here, Mila.

667
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:48,760
You know? Go to a shelter.

668
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,796
I can get you an address.

669
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,076
You don't understand.

670
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,596
I belong to him.

671
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,356
No. No.

672
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:02,396
No, no, I don't understand.

673
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,796
I was prostitute in Moscow.

674
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,752
Yugorsky Escort Service offered to
bring girls over with promise of big bucks.

675
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,955
We would owe 50 thousand dollars.
You know, pay back through work.

676
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,717
I take offer.

677
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,756
Not tell them I’m pregnant.

678
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,236
When they find out...

679
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,076
..they insist I have an abortion.

680
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,076
I tell them no.

681
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,356
They send Anzor to kill me.

682
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,356
Anzor's not a killer.

683
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,031
He's not...a hard man like big Yugorsky.

684
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,076
He thinks...

685
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,516
..he thinks he's John Wayne.

686
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,796
Wants to do right thing.

687
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,869
He goes against his uncle, and tells
big man Yugorsky he will pay off my debt.

688
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,196
His uncle refuses...

689
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,036
..and tells him...

690
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,076
he will send others to kill me.

691
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,996
Set example.

692
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,756
So Anzor make me wife.

693
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,640
Big man Yugorsky can't kill his nephew's wife.

694
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,550
But he...tells Anzor to leave Little Odessa.

695
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,553
He's no longer working for Yugorsky family.

696
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,470
I’m gonna get you the name of a shelter.

697
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,956
You OK?

698
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,429
This ain't right, Joe.
He don't need to be put through this.

699
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:13,478
Hey, Nick, I’m proud of you.
You done good, all right?

700
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,278
I’m gonna head up to Community Hills.

701
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:28,592
Cops don't got the gun yet but I may have
a line on it so I’m gonna go over there.

702
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:30,875
I’m scared, Joe.

703
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,111
I am pissed at you, and I am scared!

704
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:36,156
Equal measures.

705
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,873
Be careful.

706
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,958
- Hey.
- Hey.

707
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:57,917
Just got word. The cops picked up the kid.

708
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:01,390
<i>- Anything you still wanna tell us?
- Tell you what? There's nothing to tell.</i>

709
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,715
- Where you headed, Joe?
- Erm....

710
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:07,758
I was supposed to head to the store
and pick up some milk and eggs.

711
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:10,229
in all the excitement I forgot to do it, so...

712
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:12,550
Hm.

713
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,393
Yugorsky's gonna call us
when he talks to the kid.

714
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,756
<i>Don't go too far</i>

715
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,076
- Later, Joe.
- Yeah, see ya.

716
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,313
Hey, Tee. Looking fucking good.

717
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,356
He keeps giving me this bullshit story
about finding the gun

718
00:54:38,356 --> 00:54:40,715
in some abandoned locker in school.

719
00:54:40,715 --> 00:54:42,279
What do you want me to do?

720
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,079
The little fucker shot me.
He ain't gonna spill dick to me.

721
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:48,118
You know,
I don't think I’m being clear enough here.

722
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,156
You know what I mean?

723
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,196
Let me be crystal clear.

724
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,752
You get the boy to give up Gazelle
or I’m closing shop on your tweaker ass

725
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:00,910
and I’m taking you down fucking hard.

726
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,592
Understand me?

727
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,352
Hey, cowboy.

728
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,156
Wanna go get some ice cream?

729
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,756
Get the fuck away from my car.

730
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:45,668
- Hey. Hey, I’m looking for Manny Perez.
- He's not here.

731
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:49,070
No! Oh, my God! I’ve never seen him.

732
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,355
- Manny? Where the fuck is he?
- He's not here!

733
00:55:51,355 --> 00:55:54,079
- Where is he? Where is he?
- He's not here!

734
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,559
Better not fucking lie to me!

735
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,517
- Argh!
- Where the fuck is he?

736
00:55:57,517 --> 00:55:59,238
- Where is he?
- OK, OK!

737
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:01,197
- Where is he?
- He play cards at Armando's.

738
00:56:01,197 --> 00:56:02,315
- Armando's?
- Uh-huh.

739
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,072
He's at Armando's. Yeah.

740
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:06,833
Get the hell out of the way! Just stay right there.

741
00:56:09,753 --> 00:56:11,717
<i>- What's your name?</i>

742
00:56:11,717 --> 00:56:13,279
What's your name?

743
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:15,316
- Conchita.
- Conchita.

744
00:56:15,316 --> 00:56:18,437
Now you listen to me, Conchita.
You listen to me real good.

745
00:56:18,437 --> 00:56:19,999
- I don't wanna hurt Manny.
- OK.

746
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:22,913
I don't wanna hurt him,
but he has something that belongs to me.

747
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:25,389
- A gun. Do you know anything about a gun?
-No, no.

748
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:27,914
It’s block 5, number 602. That's where he is.

749
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,312
OK. Now listen to me.

750
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:32,994
We are now on what we call the honor system.
You comprende?

751
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:34,479
- You understand?
- Si, señor.

752
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:36,198
OK. You don't call Manny.

753
00:56:36,198 --> 00:56:37,713
You don't tell Manny I’m coming.

754
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:40,951
You don't warn him for anything,
cos if you do, I’m gonna come back here!

755
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,916
I can be an asshole.

756
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,036
You made your point.

757
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,192
You showed some balls.

758
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,556
<i>I like that</i>

759
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,716
But now it's time to be smart.

760
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,669
You tell me...what I want to know.

761
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,958
And I’m gonna reward you.

762
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,076
<i>Razors season tickets</i>

763
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,750
- I’m sorry.
- It’s OK.

764
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,315
I told you, we're cool.

765
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:31,789
- Just tell me.
- I’m sorry I missed.

766
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,155
You little shit.

767
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,916
Tell me where the fucking gun is.

768
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,116
You tell me or I will fucking kill you!

769
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,514
Oleg!

770
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,716
Oleg!

771
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,312
Oleg!

772
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,356
Where are you, you little shit?

773
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,672
<i>Oleg!</i>

774
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,596
I’ll find you!

00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,956
I’m gonna kill you!

776
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:31,270
You're only making it worse on yourself!

777
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,396
You hear me?

778
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,075
Edele, I think we've picked up a stray.

779
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,037
indeed.

780
00:58:49,037 --> 00:58:50,235
Well, hello there.

781
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,276
<i>- Hi
- And who might you he?</i>

782
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,309
- I think we should get another ice cream cone.
- I think you're right, papa bear.

783
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,717
Hey. Hey.

784
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:13,358
- You Manny?
- Manny, no.

785
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:15,112
He's upstairs. What you want with him?

786
00:59:15,112 --> 00:59:16,633
Business.

787
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:18,915
If he owes you any money, forget about it.

788
00:59:18,915 --> 00:59:20,877
Ha! I just cleaned the cabron out.

789
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,752
Yeah? Who is it?

790
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,192
Heads down on the fucking table!

791
00:59:34,192 --> 00:59:37,795
Heads down and hands behind your head!
You move and I will fuck you up!

I will fuck you up! Don't you move!

Don't you fucking move! Get the fuck down!

794
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:45,040
Which one of you is fucking Manny?
Who's Manny?

795
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,076
<i>Manny's not here</i>

796
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,391
<i>- Motherfucking pendejo!
- Are you Manny?</i>

797
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:53,756
You know what the fuck I want!
You called me pendejo, you fuck!

798
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,400
I want my fucking gun!
I want my fucking snub nose

799
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,436
that you lifted from the fucking Arlington.

800
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:00,988
Now, where the fuck is it? Where the fuck is it?

801
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,188
- Argh!

802
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:07,475
Fuck you! Where the fuck is my gun?

803
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,636
<i>Your tool left a while ago</i>

01:00:30,353 --> 01:00:32,032
Motherfucker!

806
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,708
<i>- Look at those braces

807
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,756
<i>Yeah</i>

808
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,797
Yeah, that's super cute.

809
01:00:44,797 --> 01:00:47,553
isn’t this cool, huh?
Yeah, come on. Look back in the camera.

810
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:50,279
Try it again. Now you push that. Look in there.

811
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,396
Oh, my gosh, yeah! You can see, right?

812
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,434
- It’s very smart.
- Hey, Eric. You wanna hug your sister?

813
01:00:56,434 --> 01:00:58,954
- Yeah. Come on, please.
- Just a little bit.

814
01:00:58,954 --> 01:01:01,554
- Get a little closer.
- Come on. You guys love each other.

815
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,312
- Get a little closer.
- You need a hug.

816
01:01:03,312 --> 01:01:04,799
<i>- A little closer
- Come on.</i>

817
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,075
<i>- Extend the arm</i>

818
01:01:07,075 --> 01:01:09,674
<i>Come on, Come on Eric</i>

819
01:01:09,674 --> 01:01:13,275
<i>You can do it a little better than that
I mean that's your sister right?</i>

820
01:01:13,275 --> 01:01:16,352
<i>Very good
-You love your sister don't you?</i>

821
01:01:16,352 --> 01:01:19,830
What about you, Oleg?
You wanna be in the film as well, don't you?

822
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,195
My stomach hurts. Can I go to the bathroom?

823
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:24,236
Sure.

824
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,956
- I’ll just hold onto this.
- Mm-hm.

825
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:29,314
Go outside.

826
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:31,356
You take a right and then a left.

827
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,668
- Hurry up, though. You're missing out.
- Mm.

828
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,833
- Who wants to play dress up?
- Oh, good, dress up!

829
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,150
We have...the Burning Falcon.

830
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,514
And the Volt.

831
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,911
There you are.
I thought you needed to go to the bathroom.

832
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,195
I couldn't find it.

833
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:01,838
Silly boy.

834
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:03,273
I told you to take a right.

835
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,390
Then a left.

836
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,999
Come. I’ll show you.

837
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,153
Don't forget to wash your hands
when you're done.

838
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,433
Joe?

839
01:03:35,433 --> 01:03:38,751
<i>- Mrs. Gazelle?

840
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,478
<i>- Is this?
- Oleg.</i>

841
01:03:40,478 --> 01:03:42,232
I’m sorry about taking the gun.

842
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:45,710
<i>- Oleg, where are you?
- I think I’m in trouble</i>

843
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:48,314
<i>Sweetheart I know what happened OK?</i>

844
01:03:48,314 --> 01:03:51,995
I need you to be straight up with me.
Are the police listening in on this call?

845
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,433
<i>No I’m not with the police</i>

846
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,750

01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:02,188
<i>Oh Jesus</i>

849
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:04,350
Come on, come on. Is this some kind of a joke?

850
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:07,318
Oleg, you have caused enough trouble today.

851
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:08,879
<i>- Where are you?
- I don't know</i>

852
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:10,279
<i>I was in the hack of a van</i>

853
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:13,238
They brought us here.
This room with all these toys.

854
01:04:13,238 --> 01:04:14,673
They're making a video.

855
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:18,753
OK. OK, Oleg. I need you to look around
for an address for me, OK?

856
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,232
Um...is there any mail laying around?

857
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,914
I’m in the bathroom.
She's gonna come back any minute.

858
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:25,319
Bathroom, Jesus.

859
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,755
I don't know. I don't know.

860
01:04:27,755 --> 01:04:29,114

<i>Err I don't know Just, just call 911</i>

862
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,958
No. I don't want to go back to the police.

863
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,393
<i>Why?</i>

864
01:04:38,393 --> 01:04:41,119
They want me to say
I got the gun from Mr. Gazelle.

865
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,031
<i>Do you need some help in there?
- I’m OK</i>

866
01:04:49,031 --> 01:04:51,554
<i>It’s my stomach I’m almost done</i>

867
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,949
Oh, you poor thing.

868
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,031
Well, I’m right outside.

869
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:58,712
<i>- Oleg?
- I’m still here</i>

870
01:04:58,712 --> 01:05:00,756
OK.

871
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,236
OK. So look in the medicine cabinet.

872
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,993
Do you see any...any bottles?

873
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:09,436
Prescription bottles usually have the address
on the front label.

874
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,715
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

875
01:05:12,715 --> 01:05:14,631
<i>Just Is there anything in there?</i>

876
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,636
<i>Oleg! What's happening?</i>

877
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,911
Oleg? It’s Dez. You wanna open up, please?

878
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,268
<i>Oleg?</i>

879
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,312
OK. Oleg?

880
01:05:34,312 --> 01:05:36,072
<i>Come on</i>

881
01:05:36,072 --> 01:05:37,991
<i>Oleg! Oleg!
Oleg?</i>

882
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:39,149
What's going on?

883
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:40,514
<i>Oleg?</i>

884
01:05:40,514 --> 01:05:43,637
- Just open the door!
- Mrs. Gazelle, I got a bottle.

885
01:05:43,637 --> 01:05:44,994
So now read me the address.

886
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:48,277
<i>- 1456, Owens Park Lane, Hoboken.
Oleg open the door!</i>

887
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,237
<i>Oleg!</i>

888
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,833
Let's go! Open the door!

889
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,391
Oleg?

890
01:05:53,391 --> 01:05:54,515
<i>Come on!</i>

891
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:56,511
Oleg!

892
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,996
Wake up. Wake up!

893
01:06:01,996 --> 01:06:05,231
- We've gotta go get Oleg. Put your coat on.
- I thought he was in jail.

894
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,876
Hey, Holmes.

895
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,477
- I got a busted headlight.
- Hey, Lester, my man!

896
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:17,915
Ouch. Who got over on you, bro?

897
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:22,630
Some puta whose forwarding address
is gonna be in ten different zip codes.

898
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,551
All of them, dumpsters.

899
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,956
I got you covered by tomorrow night.

900
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,835
Hey, check this out.

901
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,111
Is that sweet or what? Hey!
A royal flush put her in my pocket.

902
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:40,510
- Three hundred cold puts her in mine.
-No, man. She's a beauty.

903
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:42,556
Think I’m gonna hold on to her.

904
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,629
Five hundred.

905
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,879
Al won't miss them. Not until Cinco de Mayo.

906
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,948
Oh, Joe! Shit!

907
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,398
I’m under a lot of stress tonight,
so whatever I say don't count.

908
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,514
Do I still have to go to school tomorrow?

909
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:16,556
I don't know. We'll see.

910
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,836
- Remember me?
- Who the fuck are you?

911
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,949
You got something that belongs to me.
Snub nose .38.

912
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:40,474
You scored it off of Manny in a card game.
I need it back.

913
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,918
Fuck!

914
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:48,150
I want my fucking gun!

915
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,196
<i>Who the fuck are you huh?</i>

916
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,956
Don't be fucking stupid!

917
01:07:52,956 --> 01:07:54,996
Fuck!

918
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,914
You fuck! You fuck! Where's my fucking gun?

919
01:08:17,914 --> 01:08:19,911
Help me! I’m burning!

920
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:22,389
Where's my gun?
You gonna tell me where my gun is now?

921
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:26,553
If you don't tell me where I can find it you'll have
third-degree burns. Know what that means?

922
01:08:26,553 --> 01:08:29,438
No cock, asshole!
You'll have a fucking melted dick!

923
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,238
- I sold it to a pimp. Lester!
- A pimp?

924
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:33,276
Shit! What you waiting on for?

925
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,237
Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?

926
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:39,393
- I need to fucking know now!
- He booked a cab! Union Fleet. Ask them!

927
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,112
Stay here. Do not move.

928
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,116
I’m not touching it.
Get away from me. Fuck you!

929
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:04,395
wow, you little shit! Just bit me!

930
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,953
Who the hell is that?
I’ll go see. Throw me my robe.

931
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,439
Take the kids into the bedroom.

932
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,836
- May I help you?
- I’m looking for Oleg.

933
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:43,071
- Oleg. You must have the wrong address.
-No. He's a ten -year-old boy.

934
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:45,310
He's pale. He never smiles.

935
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,312
He's my neighbor’s kid.
He called me from this apartment.

936
01:09:48,312 --> 01:09:50,550
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

937
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,835
Well, he must have given you
the wrong address.

938
01:09:52,835 --> 01:09:55,036
Or maybe you heard wrong. There's no Oleg.

939
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:57,429
He said that he was being held against his will.

940
01:09:57,429 --> 01:10:01,229
That's ridiculous. There's only my husband
and my two children inside.

941
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:03,709
- No-one else. And it's late.
- Well...

942
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:06,394
I would like to take a look inside
to satisfy my curiosity.

943
01:10:06,394 --> 01:10:08,835
This is absurd.
Are you suggesting I kidnapped Oleg?

944
01:10:08,835 --> 01:10:13,357
You know what? I’m gonna call the police.
I’m gonna stand here waiting for them to arrive.

945
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:15,590
When all’s you gotta do is just let me in.

946
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,079
If you must.

947
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,556
- Do you mind?
- Go right ahead.

948
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,076
The children 's room is on the right.

949
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,912
They are asleep.

950
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:45,956
Please go right in.

951
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,109
- Hello.
- Don't ask, it's too ridiculous.

952
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:01,156
Sorry, I’m really embarrassed.

953
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,397
Excuse me,
but I seriously doubt he's hiding in there.

954
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,596
- What's through here?
- Playroom.

955
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,634
Whoa.

956
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:27,756
Wow.

957
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:29,956
You guys got your own little Disneyland in here.

958
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:34,238
Well, it's all about the children.
And as you can see, there's no Oleg.

959
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,951
I really hope that you find him.

960
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:49,156
You hear too many stories these days.

961
01:11:49,156 --> 01:11:53,631
- God only knows if it were our children.
- If it were your children...photographs.

962
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:55,676
- Excuse me!
- Photographs.

963
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,956
No photographs.

964
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,469
If they were your children, you would have...

965
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:05,279
at least one photograph
somewhere in this apartment.

966
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,796
This is ridiculous! We only moved
into this place. Everything’s in storage.

967
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:12,236
Now I really must ask you to leave! I insist!

968
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,356
Oleg?

969
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,556
Oh, man. This is too much.

970
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,114
It’s too much.

971
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:37,714
- It’s like some kind of a lure.
- You're making a mistake.

972
01:12:37,714 --> 01:12:39,153
Tell her to leave, Dez.

973
01:12:39,153 --> 01:12:42,232
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now,
I’m calling the police.

974
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:46,029
Call them. Call them. And mention you've got
two abducted children in the next room.

975
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:49,749
Two children who don't appear
in any photographs in this house.

976
01:12:49,749 --> 01:12:52,195
- Where is Oleg?
- How dare you suggest that we...

977
01:12:52,195 --> 01:12:53,713
Oh...

978
01:12:53,713 --> 01:12:55,756
Where's the boy?

979
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,716
Where is he?

980
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,639
Oh, my God. Oh...

981
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:16,676
You better pray he's not dead.

982
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,276
Back off, you sick fuck!

983
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,476
Jesus. Oh, God, help me.

984
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,276
Come on, come on, come on.

985
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,711
I said back the fuck up!

986
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:42,598
You sick, twisted, motherfucking cunt!

987
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:44,238
Oh...

988
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,352
- Oh, wake up.

989
01:13:48,352 --> 01:13:51,000
That's right. That's right.
Breathe. You're gonna be OK.

990
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,674
You can breathe, Oleg. I’m right here.

991
01:13:53,674 --> 01:13:55,512
I’m right here, just breathe.

992
01:13:55,512 --> 01:13:57,556
<i>- That's right

993
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,758
Back off!

994
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:11,070
I said back off!

995
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:13,116
I will blow you away!

996
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,070
OK. Can you get up?

997
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:23,029
OK. Go to the bedroom. Get the two kids.
Bring them downstairs. Nicky's there.

998
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:26,032
All right? Wait with him. OK? Move over.

999
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,636
Get out of his way.

1000
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,670
<i>I’ve got a safe in the bedroom
There's 100.000 cash in there and diamonds</i>

1001
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,194
All you gotta do is take the boy and walk away.

1002
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,354
Oh, my God. Oh...

1003
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,272
Oh, God.

1004
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,116
Oh...

1005
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,556
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1006
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,956
Oh, my God.

1007
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,349
Oh, you sick fucks.

1008
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:13,953
You're right. We're sick.

1009
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:16,838
<i>We are, We're sick
This Is really great This Is gonna help us</i>

1010
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:18,672
- Give me your phone.
- Please, yeah.

1011
01:15:18,672 --> 01:15:20,239
- What are you doing?
- She wants...

1012
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,639
Who are you calling?

1013
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,549
<i>911 What is the nature of your emergency?</i>

1014
01:15:29,549 --> 01:15:33,599
I just heard shooting across the hall.
1456, Owens Park Lane.

1015
01:15:33,599 --> 01:15:35,671
<i>What Is your name ma'am?</i>

1016
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,394
You're not serious.

1017
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,792
OK.

1018
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:01,277
Hey. Hey, listen, one of your cabs
just picked up my brother at AI’s Automotive.

1019
01:16:01,277 --> 01:16:02,873
Yeah, well, listen to me.

1020
01:16:02,873 --> 01:16:05,918
I was supposed to pick him up,
but there's been a family emergency.

1021
01:16:05,918 --> 01:16:10,232
So, what I need you to do is l need you
to find out where the cab dropped him off at.

1022
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,835
Yeah, call me back.
My phone number's 555-7556.

1023
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:20,076
Hello? Yeah.

1024
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,634
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Hey, calm down.

1025
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,988
- What happened to your face?
- It’s nothing.

1026
01:16:38,988 --> 01:16:40,672
- I need to talk to you, Joe.
- Later.

1027
01:16:40,672 --> 01:16:41,875
No, now!

1028
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:44,349
Why couldn't you have just taken the kid
and left?

1029
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,431
Why couldn't you have taken the kid and left?

1030
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:49,910
I have never seen evil before tonight, Joe.

1031
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:52,070
Real fucking evil.

1032
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,559
OK?

1033
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:57,474
And I know that's not what I see
when I look in your eyes.

1034
01:16:57,474 --> 01:16:59,152
Thanks a lot, Tee.

1035
01:16:59,152 --> 01:17:03,711
- I’m trying to make a point here.
- I know what point you're trying to make!

1036
01:17:03,711 --> 01:17:06,792
I did not marry an evil man, OK?

1037
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,916
I did not marry an evil man.

1038
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,037
Shady, sleazy,
mixed up with the wrong kind of people.

1039
01:17:12,037 --> 01:17:14,076
But definitely not evil.

1040
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,997
I know what you're trying to say, Tee.

1041
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,989
Do you?

1042
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,598
I hope so. I have turned my back
on a lot of things since we've been married.

1043
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:27,148
My eyes are wide open on this one

1044
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,110
Nicky, go home with your mom.

1045
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:40,156
Oleg, let's go take a ride.

1046
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,794
What kind of music you listen to?

1047
01:17:55,794 --> 01:17:57,313
Huh?

1048
01:17:57,313 --> 01:17:59,038
You listen to that techno shit?

1049
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,073
You listen to rap music? You like rap music?

1050
01:18:03,073 --> 01:18:05,310
They don't have what I listen to on the radio.

1051
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:06,719
Yeah, what's that?

1052
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,270
Kvasha. It’s my mother's tape from Russia.

1053
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,032
What the fuck?

1054
01:18:12,032 --> 01:18:13,235
Kvassna?

1055
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,834
You're American, not Russian.
Why listen to that shit?

1056
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,032
My mother said I started in her belly in Russia,
so I’m Russian.

1057
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,715
You're not a Russian, you're an American,
cos you were born in the USA.

1058
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:28,392
You're an American. An American.

1059
01:18:28,392 --> 01:18:30,072
Say, "I’m an American." You say it.

1060
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:33,038
Say, "I’m an American."
Say, "I’m an American."

1061
01:18:33,038 --> 01:18:34,678
- I’m an American.
- American.

1062
01:18:34,678 --> 01:18:37,797
You were born in the fucking USA.
That makes you an American.

1063
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,637
Listen to this.

1064
01:18:42,438 --> 01:18:45,398
He'll warm up the back seat for you
when you're ready to get laid.

1065
01:18:45,398 --> 01:18:47,436
<i>You mark my words</i>

1066
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,914
Fucking Kvasha.

1067
01:18:51,914 --> 01:18:55,595
Christ! You put me through the ringer tonight.
You know that, don't you?

1068
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,592
- Hmm?
- I won't say nothing.

1069
01:18:59,592 --> 01:19:01,193
Yeah, what'd you say to the cops?

1070
01:19:01,193 --> 01:19:05,353
- What'd you say to the cops?
- I got the gun from Stevie Monroe's locker.

1071
01:19:05,353 --> 01:19:07,271
He doesn't go there no more.

1072
01:19:07,271 --> 01:19:08,918
Nicky told me to say that.

1073
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:10,672
Nicky told you to say that?

1074
01:19:10,672 --> 01:19:12,113
Smart kid.

1075
01:19:12,113 --> 01:19:14,714
He's my best friend.
We're gonna play for the Razors.

1076
01:19:14,714 --> 01:19:16,631
- Yeah?

1077
01:19:16,631 --> 01:19:17,675
Hello?

1078
01:19:17,675 --> 01:19:19,671
Yeah, that was me.

1079
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,478
The Royal Towers? How long ago?

1080
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,554
All right, thanks.

1081
01:19:23,554 --> 01:19:26,757
Hold on. We're gonna go reclaim
some stolen property.

1082
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,757
Don't worry about it.
We're just gonna sit tight for a while.

1083
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,028
You know...

1084
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,796
..I used to know this kid.

1085
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,308
His old man was a real fucking piece of shit.

1086
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,355
Always drunk.

1087
01:20:08,355 --> 01:20:11,352
Always smacking him and his mom around.

1088
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:19,230
This kid, he takes his licks...
and waits this old fucking prick out.

1089
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,833
On the morning of his 14th birthday,

1090
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,758
he walks into his old man 's room
with a baseball bat.

1091
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,958
Then he Mark McGwire's
the fucking living shit out of him.

1092
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,951
After that, the old man,
he can't even hold a spoon without shaking.

1093
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,230
He don't remember things too good either.

1094
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,276
He's neutralized.

1095
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,116
Which is a good thing.

1096
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,716
Four more years max.

1097
01:20:57,716 --> 01:21:01,156
Maybe three if you get some size early on.
You just gotta hang in there.

1098
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,997
It’s more money.

1099
01:21:05,997 --> 01:21:07,832
<i>It’s lonely at the top</i>

1100
01:21:07,832 --> 01:21:10,388
Running these corporations...

1101
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,759
Get your hands off Lester's property.
That's my property.

1102
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:15,956
<i>I’m sorry</i>

1103
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:18,270
<i>You stay right there don't you move</i>

1104
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,431
Stay just like that.

1105
01:21:21,431 --> 01:21:23,192
What the fuck?

1106
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,636
Jesus Christ, not now.

1107
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,956
Let's get in the cab.

1108
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,514
- I can hide it for you.
-No, give it to me!

1109
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,748
They're gonna think you got the .38
and frisk you.

1110
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,554
Come on. Give me the fucking gun.

1111
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,072
Yo, Joe. What you got there?

1112
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,637
He's a Christmas elf.
I found him hitching a ride on Broad Street.

1113
01:22:06,517 --> 01:22:08,556
Joey's a funny fucking guy, huh?

1114
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,753
Let me take a guess, Joey.

1115
01:22:10,753 --> 01:22:12,910
You were just about to call us.

1116
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,195
That's pretty good. You must have telepathy.

1117
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:17,838
I must.

1118
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:19,638
Give me your piece.

1119
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,352
Think I’m fucking around?

1120
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,319
How about that, huh?

1121
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:28,038
Cocked and ready to go.

1122
01:22:28,038 --> 01:22:30,190
What are you, fucking nervous, tough guy?

1123
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,876
You're gonna follow us, Joey.

1124
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,913
<i>The kid will ride with us</i>

1125
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,913
Stay the fuck in the car.

1126
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:07,477
Yeah? Nah, nah, I’m with him right now.

1127
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,077
Are you 100 per cent?

1128
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,796
You're a fucking idiot.

1129
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,879
Nah, don't worry about it.
I’m gonna take care of this motherfucker now.

1130
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,353
Come on, what the fuck?

1131
01:23:28,353 --> 01:23:29,998
You're gonna fucking whack me?

1132
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,513
Come on, man! I told you.
You got any doubts, I’ll tell you.

1133
01:23:34,513 --> 01:23:37,751
Shut your mouth.
Shut your fucking mouth...now.

1134
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,479
You see, my old man.

1135
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,551
He says to me, "Nobody...

1136
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,113
knows nobody"

1137
01:23:46,113 --> 01:23:48,794
Would you fucking put that piece of shit away?

1138
01:23:48,794 --> 01:23:51,917
- I fucking told you on my fucking family's...
- Fucking family?

1139
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:54,355
When I leave here,
I’m gonna fuck Teresa in the ass.

1140
01:23:54,355 --> 01:23:56,590
That's how much I give a fuck about your family.

1141
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:59,319
On my fucking family, it ain't the fucking piece!

1142
01:23:59,319 --> 01:24:02,710
How fucking far do we go back?
How fucking long have we known each other?

1143
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,756
Come on, what the fuck?

1144
01:24:04,756 --> 01:24:07,115
- This is bullshit!
- Like I said...

1145
01:24:07,115 --> 01:24:10,237
"Nobody knows nobody."

1146
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,753
You fucking take this...

1147
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,108
- Not in front of the fucking kid.
- What kid?

1148
01:24:18,108 --> 01:24:21,078
Listen, you knock this fucking gun
out of my hand one more time,

1149
01:24:21,078 --> 01:24:24,072
I’m gonna blow your fucking brains
all over this fucking place.

1150
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:27,596
And I’ll fuck that kid up right in front of you!
You got that, nigger?

1151
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:30,274
Nobody knows nobody! You got that?

1152
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,756
Shit! What the fuck?

1153
01:24:39,796 --> 01:24:41,313
Oh, shit.

1154
01:24:41,313 --> 01:24:43,356
You see, Pop...

1155
01:24:43,356 --> 01:24:46,193
reached out to a friend of ours
in the department.

1156
01:24:46,193 --> 01:24:48,840
Had him pull the paper on Rydell’s recent busts.

1157
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,429
Turns out our friend Sal here
was running his own little thing on the side.

1158
01:24:53,429 --> 01:24:55,039
Hey, Sal!

1159
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:56,599
How's fucking business?

1160
01:24:56,599 --> 01:24:57,749
Huh?

1161
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,513
A few weeks back,
Sal gets bagged by Rydell and his partners.

1162
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:07,751
They let him walk as a situated informant.

1163
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,235
We just got confirmation ten minutes ago.

1164
01:25:11,235 --> 01:25:14,278
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Get the fuck up.

1165
01:25:14,278 --> 01:25:16,271
- Get the fuck up.

1166
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,628
Yeah.

1167
01:25:18,628 --> 01:25:20,073
Yeah?

1168
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,912
Oh, he's alone?

1169
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,949
Go ahead. Give me the fucking number.

1170
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,036
Have a Mai Tai on me, guys.

1171
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,519
One Nike gym bag, 60 bucks.

1172
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,038
You motherfucking guinea, cocksucking...

1173
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,795
One Nokia cell phone...100 bucks.

1174
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,914
You have just fucked yourselves!

1175
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,991
One ounce of Semtex...

1176
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:12,752
<i>- 500 bucks</i>

1177
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:18,636
Getting rid of a dirty cop...

1178
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,790
..fucking priceless.

1179
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:26,992
Now...the jury's still out on you, pal.
So do me a favor.

1180
01:26:26,992 --> 01:26:29,833
Get your ass in that car and follow me.
And hey! Hey!

1181
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,393
Don't get lost.

1182
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,554
I’m not fucking gonna.

1183
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,308
Come on down. Come on down.

1184
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,793
How you doing?

1185
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,555
So...

1186
01:27:44,555 --> 01:27:47,074
You wanna see something really cool?

1187
01:27:47,074 --> 01:27:48,513
Mm?

1188
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,911
It’s called Jet Ice.

1189
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:58,036
Black light paint.

1190
01:27:58,036 --> 01:28:00,998
<i>You gotta do crazy shit like this to fill the seats</i>

1191
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,118
Now, Oleg

1192
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,237
<i>this is very serious matter</i>

1193
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,638
This man.

1194
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,670
He give you the gun to shoot Anzor?

1195
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,273
<i>Bullshit</i>

1196
01:28:21,273 --> 01:28:24,158
He gave it to you! He told you to whack me!

1197
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:28,631
- Stop fucking protecting him!
- You shut the fuck up.

1198
01:28:31,398 --> 01:28:33,835
<i>Oleg You listen to me</i>

1199
01:28:33,835 --> 01:28:35,433
Where did you get gun?

1200
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,353
At school. I found it in a locker.

1201
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,549
Don't you fucking touch him! Don't touch him!

1202
01:28:42,549 --> 01:28:46,235
<i>- Touch him and I’ll fucking kill you!
- You shut the fuck up!</i>

1203
01:28:46,235 --> 01:28:49,118
<i>- Your turn is coming
- Yeah? Well, fucking eat me!</i>

1204
01:28:49,118 --> 01:28:51,919
You fucking Vor cocksucking bitch, fuck you!

1205
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,117
- What did you call me?
- You heard me. Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

1206
01:28:56,117 --> 01:28:59,317
I’m impressed. You know Vors.

1207
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:05,439
Vor V Zakonye, the Brotherhood.

1208
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:07,476
If you were smart man,

1209
01:29:07,476 --> 01:29:10,279
you would learn to fear this symbol.

1210
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:12,954
Fuck you and fuck your brotherhood Vors.

1211
01:29:12,954 --> 01:29:15,508
Cos I don't fucking answer to you. Fuck you!

1212
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,998
Gonna let him muscle me around?

1213
01:29:18,998 --> 01:29:21,878
We're just trying to establish
some truth here, Joe.

1214
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:24,997
To be honest, I think the man's
got some grounds for inquiry.

1215
01:29:24,997 --> 01:29:28,550
That's fucking bullshit! I told you,
I didn't give the kid the fucking piece!

1216
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:29,755
Come on, Frankie!

1217
01:29:29,755 --> 01:29:33,594
Come on, what the fuck, Frankie?
I told you! I didn't give him the fucking piece.

1218
01:29:33,594 --> 01:29:36,752
Don't let him hurt the kid, Anzor.
Don't you fucking hurt the kid!

1219
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,394
You fuck! You fucking motherfuckers!

1220
01:29:40,394 --> 01:29:43,040
I’m gonna fucking kill you! Oh, shit!

1221
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,679
Fuck you, Tommy!

1222
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,276
Don't you do this, Frankie.

1223
01:29:51,276 --> 01:29:52,793
Don't you do it!

1224
01:29:52,793 --> 01:29:55,872
<i>- Don't you fucking let him do this!

1225
01:29:55,872 --> 01:29:57,916
I’m not fucking lying!

1226
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,913
I’m not fucking lying!

1227
01:29:59,913 --> 01:30:01,513
Fuck!

1228
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,553
<i>Jesus tell them what they wanna know!</i>

1229
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,592
Fuck, I told you I didn't know anything, Frankie!

1230
01:30:09,592 --> 01:30:10,749
Fuck!

1231
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,878
A fucking human hockey puck.

1232
01:30:14,878 --> 01:30:16,359
I’m gonna fucking kill you!

1233
01:30:16,359 --> 01:30:19,637
<i>Oh you 're gonna kill me?
You 're gonna fucking kill me?</i>

1234
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:24,076
<i>- Give Anzor the gun. Kill the kid.
- Frankie don't let him do this!</i>

1235
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,192
<i>I’m gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1236
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,673
<i>Don't let them do this</i>

1237
01:30:36,673 --> 01:30:39,638
<i>What do you want me to do?
You brought it on yourself</i>

1238
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,073
No, don't!

1239
01:30:42,073 --> 01:30:44,276
Don't do it! Don't!

1240
01:30:44,276 --> 01:30:45,918
I’ll fucking talk!

1241
01:30:45,918 --> 01:30:48,719
I’ll fucking tell you
whatever you wanna fucking hear!

1242
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,678
No, my friend!
First you will see that I am serious.

1243
01:30:51,678 --> 01:30:54,638
Then afterwards, believe me, you will talk!

1244
01:30:54,638 --> 01:30:57,598
Oh, come on! Jesus Christ, I fucking told you!

1245
01:30:57,598 --> 01:31:02,435
I fucking told you, I’ll tell you whatever
you wanna hear, you fucking motherfucker.

1246
01:31:02,435 --> 01:31:04,158
Finish it! Do it right this time.

1247
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,913
No, Anzor! Anzor, look at me! Don't fucking do it!

1248
01:31:08,913 --> 01:31:10,069
Shut up!

1249
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,356
I said finish it.

1250
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,229
He's not your blood!

1251
01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:17,117
<i>Don't fucking do it!</i>

1252
01:31:17,117 --> 01:31:19,998
If you do it, I swear to God
you better swallow a bullet!

1253
01:31:19,998 --> 01:31:22,548
There's no way you'd be able
to live with yourself!

1254
01:31:22,548 --> 01:31:24,835
Trust me, Anzor! Don't do it!

1255
01:31:24,835 --> 01:31:26,911
Say something bad about the Duke.

1256
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,473
Let me hear you call him a faggot.

1257
01:31:30,473 --> 01:31:31,754
Come on!

1258
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,709
- Say it.
- No.

1259
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:38,279
<i>Shoot him!</i>

1260
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,715
What are you fucking doing?

1261
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,676
<i>Pick up the fucking gun</i>

1262
01:32:10,676 --> 01:32:12,716
<i>Pick it up</i>

1263
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,312
<i>You do it</i>

1264
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,154
<i>Gutless piece of faggot shit!</i>

1265
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,872
<i>Come on faggot!</i>

1266
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,637
I said finish it!

1267
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,589
Pick it up and use it!

1268
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,514
Pick it up and do it.

1269
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,635
Pick it up and do it!

1270
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,634
Don't you fucking walk away from me!

1271
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,476
Get up...

1272
01:33:08,476 --> 01:33:10,551
you fuck.

1273
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:18,798
Fucking bullshit.

1274
01:33:18,798 --> 01:33:20,791
Fuck. Fuck!

1275
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:24,236
Fuck you, Frankie!
I ain't taking the fucking heat for you no more.

1276
01:33:24,236 --> 01:33:26,880
It wasn’t supposed to go down this way!

1277
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:30,791
- What are you talking about?
- Czar of Brighton...

1278
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:33,474
Vor, whatever the fuck you are!

1279
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:36,358
Fucking didn't like it, did you, your nephew was...

1280
01:33:36,358 --> 01:33:38,954
was cooking and dealing in the neighborhood.

1281
01:33:38,954 --> 01:33:40,553
That's what he said.

1282
01:33:40,553 --> 01:33:42,835
He said, "Oleg, send him a message!"

1283
01:33:42,835 --> 01:33:45,115
<i>Said "Let's use the kid"</i>

1284
01:33:45,115 --> 01:33:46,235
<i>Yugi</i>

1285
01:33:46,235 --> 01:33:50,552
Would I put our thing in jeopardy
for some two-bit fucking meth lab?

1286
01:33:50,552 --> 01:33:52,835
Think about it, OK? That's number one.

1287
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:54,353
Number two.

1288
01:33:54,353 --> 01:33:58,433
I don't even live in that fucking neighborhood!
What do I care if it blows up?

1289
01:33:58,433 --> 01:34:00,078
The gun.

1290
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,759
it was Tommy's! You fuck!

1291
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,471
Tommy! Tommy, don't get involved
in a goddamn jock fight. It’s all bullshit!

1292
01:34:09,471 --> 01:34:11,551
He fucking put it in my right hand.

1293
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:15,872
A fucking snub nose .38, stainless steel.
it was Tommy's gun!

1294
01:34:15,872 --> 01:34:19,873
You motherfucker.
I told you to get rid of that fucking piece.

1295
01:34:19,873 --> 01:34:21,916
Yeah, well, not to my fucking recollection!

1296
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:25,709
He said, "interest the tweaker's kid in the piece."

1297
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:29,588
That's what he said.
"interest the tweaker's kid in the piece."

1298
01:34:29,588 --> 01:34:30,795
Ask the kid!

1299
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,758
Ask the kid.

1300
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:36,274
Mr. Gazelle, he gave me the gun.

1301
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:42,070
He said I’d get to go to the game if...
if I shot Anzor.

1302
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,912
it would make his friends happy.

1303
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,991
I’m sorry, kid.

1304
01:34:45,991 --> 01:34:49,038
OK. OK. Fuck this bullshit.

1305
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,557
Fuck you, Joey, you fucking bastard!

1306
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:54,516
You're fucking dead, nigger!

1307
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,712
- Oh, I’m fucking shot!
- That's some bad motherfucker!

1308
01:35:07,712 --> 01:35:08,915
Fucking Vor!

1309
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,988
Fuck you, cocksucker!

1310
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,433
You son of a bitch!

1311
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,358
- You're dying, motherfucker!

1312
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,155
Where's the fucking gun?

1313
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,753
Mr. Gazelle!

1314
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,636
Fuck you.

1315
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,396
Oh...

1316
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,671
Get off him, you fuck!

1317
01:37:13,671 --> 01:37:17,070
Do you know you got my son killed,
you fucking scumbag?

1318
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,718
Oh, Frankie.

1319
01:37:18,718 --> 01:37:21,314
I’m glad it's you
cos there's something I’ve been...

1320
01:37:21,314 --> 01:37:23,391
I’ve really been meaning to get off my chest.

1321
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:27,268
You rat cocksucker! All of this fucking time!

1322
01:37:27,268 --> 01:37:29,112
Yeah, this whole fucking time!

1323
01:37:29,112 --> 01:37:31,191
This whole fucking time!

1324
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:34,989
But we don't have your finger on the trigger,
so do me! It’s one more nail in your coffin!

1325
01:37:34,989 --> 01:37:37,150
Oh, you got all that, do you?

1326
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:40,312
How come it took you so long, then,
huh, tough guy? Huh?

1327
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:42,709
How come? So fucking long! Tell me!

1328
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:45,109
You had to climb into bed with Yugorsky,
didn't you?

1329
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,715
I was all but out and you had to go and mix it up
with the fucking Russians.

1330
01:37:48,715 --> 01:37:52,031
12 years undercover
and my own wife don't even fucking know.

1331
01:37:52,031 --> 01:37:54,509
Oh, you cocksucker. You don't have to worry.

1332
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,473
She ain't never gonna hear it
from your fucking lips anyhow!

1333
01:37:58,473 --> 01:38:00,516
You fucking scumbag!

1334
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,996
I’ll tell her all about it
while she sucks my fucking dick!

1335
01:38:13,157 --> 01:38:15,800
Come on. Come on!

1336
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,075
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

1337
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,477
<i>What are you gonna do with that little boy?</i>

1338
01:38:23,477 --> 01:38:25,676
You know that I had a little boy? My Tommy.

1339
01:38:25,676 --> 01:38:28,149
<i>At one time he was your age</i>

1340
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:31,152
What are you gonna do with that, kid?
What are you gonna do?

1341
01:38:31,152 --> 01:38:35,074
What are you gonna do with that,
you Cheerio-bred, little motherfucker!

1342
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,876
Let's go home.

1343
01:39:31,076 --> 01:39:32,673
in position!

1344
01:39:32,673 --> 01:39:35,194
All right. On the other side. Let's go!

1345
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,750
Jesus Christ, Joey, we got shorted out.

1346
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,319
We lost you back in Newark.

1347
01:39:47,319 --> 01:39:49,118
You were headed for Little Odessa.

1348
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:51,031
Air support finally made your Mustang.

1349
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,996
I’m taking the kid home to his mom.

1350
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,876
Joey, where are you going?

1351
01:39:56,876 --> 01:39:59,076
You're hurt. We gotta get you to a hospital.

1352
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,832
I’m going home.

1353
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,597
What are you thinking?

1354
01:40:17,597 --> 01:40:19,477
I don't wanna go home.

1355
01:40:19,477 --> 01:40:23,678
Well, I’m next door to you, remember,
and I’m gonna be keeping my eye on you.

1356
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:34,114
Why don't we get breakfast before we have to
start making with the heavy explaining?

1357
01:40:34,114 --> 01:40:36,350
Get ourselves cleaned up a bit.

1358
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,232
Hey, listen.

1359
01:41:03,232 --> 01:41:06,073
I’m taking Nick to the game on Friday night.

1360
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,997
Maybe we could find another ticket.

1361
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,349
If you would like to go, that is.

1362
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,190
All right, that's good.

1363
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:30,878
You want some more orange juice?

1364
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,432
All right.

1365
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,632
Well, err...

1366
01:41:43,632 --> 01:41:45,676
What do you say, we get out of here?

1367
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,517
Well, lookie, lookie.

1368
01:42:00,517 --> 01:42:02,875
If it ain't little Charlie Bronson.

1369
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:08,510
One thing about Lester.
He always makes good on a promise.

1370
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:09,874
Hey, asshole!

1371
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,396
What the fuck are you doing?

1372
01:42:15,396 --> 01:42:18,278
- You fucking piece of shit!

1373
01:42:18,278 --> 01:42:21,750
- You big fucking...
- Cocksucker!

1374
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:25,628
- in your face, motherfucker!

1375
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,030
Say hello to my little friend.

1376
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,476
That's real fucking original.
What are you? A fucking cartoon?

1377
01:42:37,476 --> 01:42:40,438
I’m a Mac Daddy pimp. You know that.

1378
01:42:40,438 --> 01:42:42,750
<i>And now I’m gonna cap your ass</i>

1379
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:46,276
<i>When I’m finished with you
I’m gonna take your little punk friend</i>

1380
01:42:46,276 --> 01:42:48,715
and I’m gonna put him in my posse.

1381
01:42:48,715 --> 01:42:51,030
And I’m gonna pimp him out
for a couple of months!

1382
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:54,396
And then I’m gonna take your knife
and cut him from ear to ear!

1383
01:42:54,396 --> 01:42:56,789
Just like I should have done yesterday, you fuck!

1384
01:42:56,789 --> 01:42:59,440
I’m sure that sounds great to you
in your pimp world.

1385
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,592
But, listen.
That's not the fucking thing you wanna do!

1386
01:43:02,592 --> 01:43:05,433
You wanna put down that fucking gun
and walk away.

1387
01:43:05,433 --> 01:43:09,035
Cos I swear to fucking God, I’ll fucking kill you!
Stupid fucking pimp bitch!

1388
01:43:09,035 --> 01:43:10,439
Wrong!

1389
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:13,432
Only one of us is walking out of here.
Guess who.

1390
01:43:13,432 --> 01:43:15,351
Oleg, get behind me.

1391
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,357
Oleg, get behind me!

1392
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:40,519
<i>Come on!</i>

1393
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,834
<i>Oleg talk to me Come on! Talk to me!</i>

1394
01:43:43,834 --> 01:43:45,638
<i>You 're gonna make it</i>

1395
01:43:45,638 --> 01:43:47,915
<i>Joey please You're bleeding</i>

1396
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,398
Fuck, fuck!

1397
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,513
OLEG: Look out! Look out!

1398
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:13,956
Mr. Gazelle! Stop the car.
We need to get some help.

1399
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,234
Tee...

1400
01:44:15,234 --> 01:44:17,436
<i>- Please Mr. Gazelle!
- Tee...I’m coming home.</i>

1401
01:44:33,709 --> 01:44:36,633
Mr. Gazelle, please! Stop the car.
We need to get some help.

1402
01:44:36,633 --> 01:44:39,234
- I’ve gotta tell her.
- You're hurt!

1403
01:44:39,234 --> 01:44:41,390
<i>I’m gonna make it home</i>

1404
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,433
<i>You're bleeding!</i>

1405
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,513
God.

1406
01:44:58,513 --> 01:45:00,511
Oh, God!

1407
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,995
Oh, my God.

1408
01:45:09,995 --> 01:45:11,513
- Joey!

1409
01:45:11,513 --> 01:45:14,751
Joey, please! Stop!

1410
01:45:14,751 --> 01:45:17,035
Mr. Gazelle, wake up!

1411
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:25,558
<i>Mr. Gazelle! Wake up! Come on!</i>

1412
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,754
Stop the car! Stop the car!

1413
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:30,035
Please! Stop!

1414
01:45:30,035 --> 01:45:31,075
Joe?

1415
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,196
Mr. Gazelle, watch out!

1416
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,151
Joe! Joe!

1417
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,356
Oleg, wait! Wait!

1418
01:45:42,356 --> 01:45:43,589
Oh, God!

1419
01:45:43,589 --> 01:45:45,432
Mom! Mom!

1420
01:45:45,432 --> 01:45:47,158
Joe!

1421
01:45:47,158 --> 01:45:49,071
Jesus!

1422
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,074
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

1423
01:45:51,074 --> 01:45:53,310
Nicky! Call 911!

1424
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,912
Don't do this to me, Joe.

1425
01:45:56,912 --> 01:45:59,309
- Don't fucking do this to me.
- Oh, sweetheart.

1426
01:45:59,309 --> 01:46:00,833
I loved you.

1427
01:46:00,833 --> 01:46:01,750
OK?

1428
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:02,955
Just remember.

1429
01:46:02,955 --> 01:46:04,553
I was always the real Joey.

1430
01:46:04,553 --> 01:46:06,358
OK? I wasn't a liar.

1431
01:46:06,358 --> 01:46:08,317
Shut up. Shut up. Look at me.

1432
01:46:08,317 --> 01:46:10,231
Look at me. Baby, look at me in the eye.

1433
01:46:10,231 --> 01:46:13,676
Joey, look at me in the eyes.
I don't care, OK? it doesn't matter.

1434
01:46:13,676 --> 01:46:15,796
I’m gonna kick your ass over it later.

1435
01:46:15,796 --> 01:46:17,472
Stay with me, Joey! Stay! Look at me!

1436
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,994
Look at me, I’m right here!
I’m right here for you!

1437
01:46:19,994 --> 01:46:21,718
Nicky! Nicky, come here!

1438
01:46:21,718 --> 01:46:23,756
Nicky! Nicky!

1439
01:46:23,756 --> 01:46:26,035
- He's right here.
- They're coming.

1440
01:46:26,035 --> 01:46:27,348
<i>- They're on their way
- OK.</i>

1441
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,510
We're still going to the game Friday, Dad?

1442
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:33,592
- I love you, Nick!
- It’s OK.

1443
01:46:33,592 --> 01:46:35,910
- He wants to go to the game, baby.
- Yeah.

1444
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:37,797
We're gonna go to the game.

1445
01:46:37,797 --> 01:46:42,112
- And fucking kick their asses, right, Mom?
- They are going down big fucking time!

1446
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,593
You have a bad mouth.

1447
01:46:44,593 --> 01:46:46,671
You have a... You have a bad mouth.

1448
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,830
<i>- It’s not that bad. You'll be OK.
- Joe?</i>

1449
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,833
I’m right here.

1450
01:46:58,833 --> 01:47:01,309
- Stay right...
- I’m right here. I’m right here.

1451
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,117
Joe?

1452
01:47:04,117 --> 01:47:05,599
- Joe?

1453
01:47:05,599 --> 01:47:06,795
Joe?

1454
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:08,598
Joe? Oh, God, no, no!

1455
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,479
Oh, God, no!

1456
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:15,835
Oh, God, Joe!

1457
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,800
Get the kid outside!
I don't want him going in there!

1458
01:48:23,113 --> 01:48:25,350
Hey, Luis.

1459
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,958
Hey, George?

1460
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:34,554
- The alternator is in the car.
- All right.

1461
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:42,393
Don't ever ask me to bury you again, Joe.

1462
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,110
- What did they put in that coffin really?
- What?

1463
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:04,350
- What did they put in the coffin?
- in the coffin?

1464
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:06,271
- Yeah.
- Why? Did it seem heavy?

1465
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:07,429
Yeah!

1466
01:49:07,429 --> 01:49:10,796
I don't know.
I’m thinking, probably a couple of blue shirts.

1467
01:49:10,796 --> 01:49:13,599
Must have been Lashon and McCall.

1468
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:15,671
- Does that sound good?
- And Caimen.

1469
01:49:15,671 --> 01:49:17,910
- You want some of this too?
- For sure, Marishka.

1470
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:19,558
Marishka, you want some of this too?

1471
01:49:19,558 --> 01:49:22,598
I’ll take the both of you right now.
How about that?

1472
01:49:22,598 --> 01:49:24,830
Razors.
