1
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,750
Cracking job, Gromit.

2
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,553
Hang on, old chum.

3
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,058
- What's going on?
- Who is it?

4
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,596
Reel him in, lad.

5
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,098
To me. To me.

6
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,662
Gotcha! Thieving monster.

7
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,810
Me prize pumpkin.

8
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,940
Me little baby. Me pride and joy.

9
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,712
You've saved it, Anti-Pesto.

10
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,481
It was nothing at all, Mrs...

11
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,620
- Everything's under control.
- Oh, no!

12
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,421
Don't worry, madam.

13
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,331
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

14
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,458
All in a night's work, Mrs. Mulch.

15
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,629
Cute little feller, isn't he?

16
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,573
You'd never believe
they'd cause so much damage.

17
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,473
Oh, he may look innocent, sir.

18
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,739
But left to his own devices,

19
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,340
this is the ultimate
vegetable-destroying machine.

20
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,183
Reg, me teeth!

21
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,621
Job well done, lad.

22
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,223
Subject disarmed and neutralized.

23
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,626
Bless you, Anti-Pesto.

24
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,137
With you out there protecting our veg,

25
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,470
the most important event
of the year is safe.

26
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,035
Aye. And I hope they give them pests
what's coming to 'em, and all.

27
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,014
Amen to that, Mrs. Mulch.

28
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,357
It was a long, hard night
last night, Gromit.

29
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,463
I'll need a good, hearty
breakfast under me belt.

30
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,439
Pile it up, lad.

31
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,638
I'm in the mood for food!

32
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,782
Gromit, old pal.

33
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,913
It's happened again.
I'll need assistance.

34
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,375
Well, thanks, chuck.

35
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,435
I'm sure that hole's getting smaller.

36
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:40,747
Another successful night.
How are the inmates?

37
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,221
Must be getting
a bit full down there.

38
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,221
Talking of which.

39
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,025
Now, for a great big plate of...

40
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,457
...vegetables.

41
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,104
Still got me on the diet, eh, Gromit?

42
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:05,200
Watching me shape?
There's a good dog.

43
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,911
Gromit, lad?

44
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,314
How is that prize melon
of yours coming on?

45
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,252
Must be a while
since you measured it.

46
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:46,951
Lovely food. For rabbits, that is.

47
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:57,587
As for me, I need something
a bit more cheesy.

48
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,875
Caught red-handed, eh, lad?

49
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,480
I'm sorry, Gromit.

50
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,361
I know you're doing this
for my own good,

51
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:33,330
but the fact is
I'm just crackers about cheese.

52
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,097
Look, if I must change me ways,

53
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,330
at least let me do it my way.

54
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,173
With technology.

55
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,708
It's time we tried my latest invention,

56
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,574
the Mind Manipulation-omatic.

57
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,720
It extracts unwanted
thoughts and desires.

58
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,250
I haven't tested it yet,
but it should be perfectly safe.

59
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,889
Just a bit of harmless
brain alteration, that's all.

60
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,377
Anti-Pesto Humane Pest Control.
How might we be of assistance?

61
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,040
Yes. Lady Tottington here
of Tottington Hall.

62
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,480
Your Ladyship.

63
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,745
This is an honor.

64
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,516
It's a disaster. I have
the most terrible rabbit problem.

65
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,548
The competition's only days away.
You simply have to do something.

66
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,324
Certainly, ma'am. I think we're
about to go up in the world, lad.

67
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,195
Just stay right where you are,
your Ladyship,

68
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,531
and we'll be with you in an...

69
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,597
In an hour? I can't wait an hour.

70
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:52,201
I have a major infestation.
Hello? Hello?

71
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,210
That's more like it.

72
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,408
Thank goodness you've...

73
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,889
What ho! For you, my love.

74
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,858
Victor. How lovely and... unexpected.

75
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,898
Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother
and toodled on over

76
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,432
to sort the blighters out.

77
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,128
Gosh, that's awfully sweet of you.

78
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,000
But you really needn't bother.

79
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,007
It's no bother, little boo-boo. It's
the least a chap can do for his filly.

80
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,738
Don't want pests spoiling
our beautiful manor house, do we?

81
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,575
"Our" manor house?

82
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,310
No one's mentioned marriage, Victor.

83
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,375
All in good time, my dear.

84
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,444
Vermin first, though, what what.

85
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,387
Come on, Phillip.

86
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,446
Victor!

87
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,017
We can deal with this humanely.

88
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,424
Very classy.

89
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,664
Just the sort of client
we should be dealing with, eh, lad?

90
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,116
Burrowing bounders!

91
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,721
They must be breeding like...

92
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,447
...well, rabbits.

93
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,387
Only one thing for it, lad.

94
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,264
Victor, hadn't we agreed?

95
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,600
No more thoughtless killing.

96
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,139
Quite right, my dear.

97
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,835
So I've thought this one through
very carefully.

98
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,572
It's off to bunny heaven
for you, big ears.

99
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,977
Victor! No!

100
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,143
What the...?

101
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,666
Champion sucker, eh, Gromit?

102
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,333
The BunVac 6000.

103
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,637
This'll impress her Ladyship.

104
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,713
I don't understand.
It should have been a bull's-eye.

105
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,375
Oh, Victor. I felt we'd
made a real breakthrough

106
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,250
with this hunting obsession of yours.
I really thought you'd changed.

107
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:19,985
I'm sorry, Campanula,
but I am what I am.

108
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,721
There's no nonsense
with Victor Quartermaine.

109
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,525
What you see is what you get.

110
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,990
What the...?

111
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,165
Sounds like a really big brute,
this one.

112
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,539
Give it some more welly.

113
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,804
Gosh!

114
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,618
Maybe I should've
used a bigger nozzle.

115
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,599
Anti-Pesto, you're here.

116
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,269
Your Ladyship.

117
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,699
My darlings!

118
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,246
You're safe.

119
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,572
My word!

120
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,608
What a fabulous job you've done.
And not a single one harmed.

121
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,712
The old BV6000, ma'am.

122
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:28,123
Capable of 1 25 RPM.
That's rabbits per minute.

123
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,889
How inspired!

124
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,453
- Mr...?
- Oh, Wallace.

125
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,192
Mr. Wallace.

126
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,530
Is this all of them?

127
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,368
Just one left.
Hoist her up, Gromit.

128
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:54,083
Victor, stop fooling around in the dirt
and have a look at this.

129
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,451
The ingenious Anti-Pesto

130
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,252
have completely dealt
with my rabbit problem.

131
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,690
- lsn't it marvelous?
- Marvelous?

132
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,819
Marvelous?

133
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:07,025
This confounded contraption
virtually suffocated me!

134
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,831
Besides, the job's only half done.

135
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,338
How do you intend
to finish these vermin off?

136
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,465
Crush 'em? Liquidize 'em?

137
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,308
- They're humane.
- Humane?

138
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,476
Well, then perhaps they'd be humane
enough to give me back my dignity.

139
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,178
I want...

140
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,990
Toupee, please.

141
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,152
Oh, grand.
We take check or cash.

142
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,688
Toupee, you idiot!
My hair is in your machine.

143
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,133
Oh, no, it's only rabbits in there.

144
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,502
The hare, I think you'll find,
is a much larger mammal.

145
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,404
Out of my way, fool.

146
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,746
I'm sorry, my dear, but I refuse
to suffer any further humiliation

147
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,614
at the hands of these
blundering nitwits.

148
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,416
I therefore bid you good day.

149
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:13,030
Thank you for ridding me
of a real problem, Mr. Wallace.

150
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:17,330
Tell me, what exactly will you do
with all these rabbits?

151
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,167
Trade secret.

152
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,198
Yes. I'd be happy to let them roam free
if it wasn't for the competition.

153
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,244
But they do so love their veg.

154
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:30,042
It's in their little bunny natures,
and you can't change that, can you?

155
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,810
No.

156
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,013
Or can you?

157
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,027
Why didn't we think of it before, lad?

158
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,690
The solution to all
our storage problems.

159
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:53,499
Simply by connecting the BunVac

160
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,439
to the Mind Manipulation-omatic,

161
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,266
we can brainwash the bunnies.

162
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,177
Rabbit rehabilitation.

163
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,081
Once cured of their antisocial
veg-ravaging behavior,

164
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,615
the rabbits can be safely released
without fear of re-offending.

165
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:20,326
Just a little added lunar power
to enhance the mind waves...

166
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,398
...and we can begin.

167
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,109
Veg, bad.

168
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,081
Veg, bad.

169
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,641
Veg, bad.

170
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,415
Say no to carrots,

171
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,018
cabbage and cauliflower.

172
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,157
Well, come on, lad,
what are you waiting for?

173
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,098
Turn on the BunVac.

174
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,726
Full suction.

175
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,347
It's working, Gromit.
It's working!

176
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,983
Their tiny bunny brains

177
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,656
are being saturated
in my veg-free mind waves.

178
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,096
Another 30 minutes
brainwashing should suffice.

179
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,800
Then we can move on
to the conditioning.

180
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,782
Gromit!

181
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,182
Switch it off!

182
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,725
Get it off!

183
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,362
Get it off me, lad!

184
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,478
Oh, thanks, lad.

185
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,582
Quick.

186
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,622
Give us a carrot.

187
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,159
It worked, Gromit!

188
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,567
A reformed rabbit.

189
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,266
We'll call him Hutch. Shall we?

190
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,468
Come on. Let's get the kettle on.

191
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,943
We'll see to him in the morning.

192
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:55,343
I feel we're on the cusp
of a real breakthrough, lad.

193
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:03,322
Mankind freed from
rabbit problems forever.

194
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,958
Lady Tottington will be impressed.

195
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,313
Good night.

196
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,849
Sleep tight.

197
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,825
And don't let the bed bugs bite.

198
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,533
Good night, Gromit.

199
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,443
Sweet dreams, old chum.

200
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:54,373
Protect and nourish the frail
and the weak, O Lord.

201
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,867
Protect and nourish the frail
and the weak, O Lord.

202
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:03,847
Let them grow big and strong
under Thy loving care.

203
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:08,375
In fact, let them grow bigger
and stronger than anyone else's,

204
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,684
so that the first prize might be mine.

205
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,952
Amen.

206
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,128
The harvest offering
to bind the deal.

207
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:24,001
We plow the fields
and scatter the good seed on...

208
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,259
He sends the snow in winter...

209
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,269
All good gifts around us

210
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,704
Are sent from...

211
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,307
Heavens above.

212
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,538
Hello?

213
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,313
Hello? Is anybody there?

214
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,148
Mrs. Mulch?

215
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,060
Please, come forward,
whoever you are.

216
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,825
There's no need to be afraid.

217
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:34,937
You're hungry.
Then please, take what you like.

218
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,203
It is for the needy, after all.

219
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,212
No! No! No! No!

220
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,085
Mercy!

221
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,747
Morning, Gromit.

222
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,761
A pest-free night per... chance?

223
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,460
Lummy day.

224
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,073
- It's a disaster.
- Me garden's ruined.

225
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,971
- It's a disaster.
- Me garden's ruined.

226
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,737
- It's carnage out there.
- Where were Anti-Pesto?

227
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,574
Simmer down.
Simmer down, now.

228
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,810
Right. One at a time, if ya please.

229
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,853
We pay good money
for our crop protection.

230
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,357
If ya can't deliver the goods,
maybe you should keep your traps shut.

231
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,256
I never saw such cauliflower carnage.

232
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,526
Worse than the
Great Slug Blight of '32,

233
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,399
when there were slugs
the size of pigs.

234
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,630
Growbag's right. The slugs are back!

235
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,933
The slugs are back!

236
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,099
That's enough! That's enough!

237
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,942
Look, this flippin'
vegetable competition

238
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,846
- causes nothin' but trouble every year.
- Here we go.

239
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,645
- If ya ask me...
- Get on with ya!

240
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:04,917
Know what? I'll tell ya.
If ya ask me, this was arson.

241
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,457
- Arson?
- Aye!

242
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,220
Someone arsin' around.

243
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,695
That's right.
One of you lot. A man.

244
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,232
- This was no man.
- What are you saying?

245
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,828
Does a man have teeth

246
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,773
the size of axe blades?

247
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,007
Or ears like terrible tombstones?

248
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,287
By tampering with nature,

249
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:42,088
forcing vegetables to swell
far beyond their natural size,

250
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,029
we have brought a terrible judgment
upon ourselves.

251
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,829
Hey! Give over!

252
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,837
You're mental.

253
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,169
And for our sins,

254
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,178
a hideous creature
has been sent to punish us all!

255
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,474
Repent! Repent!

256
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,349
Lest you too, taste the wrath of...

257
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,449
...the Were-Rabbit!

258
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,627
This is terrible!
What's going to happen to us?

259
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,856
- Doomed!
- Who's going to help us?

260
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,127
- What's to become of the show?
- We live for that competition.

261
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,862
- Get off me.
- We're simple folk. It's all we have.

262
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,404
- Who will save us?
- Get... Hey!

263
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,136
A Were-Rabbit?

264
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,471
Oh, come, come, now.

265
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,241
I do believe the vicar's been
to the communion wine again.

266
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,619
What we are dealing with here
is no supernatural rabbit.

267
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:46,145
It's a big fellow, perhaps.

268
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,658
But a mortal creature
of flesh and blood.

269
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,390
A matter easily dealt with
by a hunter.

270
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,928
Guns will not be necessary,
thank you, Victor.

271
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,129
Hasn't there been enough destruction?

272
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,967
I believe the killing
of fluffy creatures

273
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,170
is never justified.

274
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,341
I say we give Anti-Pesto
a second chance.

275
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,580
What? How on earth would
those tiny-minded buffoons

276
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,520
ever catch such a big rabbit?

277
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,190
Mr. Wallace?

278
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,425
Well...

279
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,764
With a big trap.

280
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,003
By Jove. He's... He's got it!

281
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,476
- Genius!
- Genius!

282
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,342
- Brilliant.
- What a great idea!

283
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,847
Clever.

284
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,785
You see, Victor,

285
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,015
there's hope for the vegetables yet.

286
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,653
Not the ones I'm looking at.

287
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,286
That's me boys!

288
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,202
Love, Gromit.

289
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,369
That's the biggest trap of all.

290
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,571
The "tender trap," they call it.

291
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,445
And that's what we'll use
to catch this thing.

292
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:22,680
Yes, lad, a lovely lady rabbit.

293
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,983
How could any
hot-blooded rabbit-beast resist?

294
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,864
Oh, come on, Gromit.

295
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,138
A bit more, you know, alluring.

296
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,981
Very cheeky.

297
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,621
That's more like it, lad.

298
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,359
How can we possibly fail now?

299
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,600
You're a total knockout.

300
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,812
Stick around, lad.

301
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,810
Should fix back on quite easily.

302
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,163
Nighty-night, me lovelies.

303
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,566
Think big now.

304
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,078
No!

305
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,626
Don't worry. No. No.

306
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,298
Well, I'm very sorry, Mrs. Mulch.

307
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:45,342
We'll get there as soon as we can.
Mr. Dibber. Oh, yes.

308
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,401
Can I call you back? Mrs. Girdling.

309
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,380
- A tunnel you say?
- What do you intend to do about this?

310
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,314
I'll look into it.

311
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,812
So where did you get to, lad?

312
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,185
I thought I told you to stay put.

313
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,257
It's gone mad around here.

314
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:04,058
I thought we were
supposed to be a team.

315
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,554
How are we ever
gonna catch this thing

316
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,123
if you go gallivanting off
on your own all the time?

317
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,864
You're doing it again!

318
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,701
Where are you going now?

319
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,502
Gromit!

320
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,370
Grommy!

321
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,008
Really, lad.

322
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:28,381
You do realize I've made
a personal promise to Lady Tottington.

323
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,886
How is this sort of
behavior going to get us

324
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,982
any nearer to finding
a rabbit-mon... ster?

325
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,165
Hutch.

326
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,960
Oh, Gromit.

327
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,030
We've created a monster.

328
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,803
Hutch is the beast.

329
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,546
The lunar panels.

330
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:03,582
They must've over-stimulated
Hutch's primitive bunny nature.

331
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,020
And now, when the moon appears,

332
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,322
he undergoes
a hideous transformation.

333
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,040
Oh, Gromit.

334
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,545
This is absolutely...

335
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,111
...fantastic!

336
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,552
Don't you see, lad?

337
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:43,185
OK, so we've created
a veg-ravaging rabbit-monster.

338
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,924
But we've also captured it.

339
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,432
Just like I promised Lady Tottington.

340
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,128
I'll go and tell her the good news.

341
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,294
Make sure he doesn't escape.

342
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,772
Bye!

343
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,598
Mr. Wallace.

344
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,801
It's the beast, your Ladyship.
I bring great news.

345
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,572
Gosh, how exciting.
Please, do come in.

346
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,818
Well, this is simply spiffing news.

347
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,796
With the beast in captivity,
the competition can go ahead as planned.

348
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,629
You saved the day, Mr. Wallace.

349
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,794
It was nothing, your Ladyship.

350
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,997
So modest.

351
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,835
Oh, please, do help yourself.

352
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,103
Thanks.

353
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,912
I so appreciate you coming
all this way to let me know, Wallace.

354
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,043
Tell me, are you
a vegetable-lover yourself?

355
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,452
- They're... growing on me.
- Then come with me.

356
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:29,721
There's something
very special I want to show you.

357
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,025
Hop in.

358
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,836
- It's very snug.
- It's my Jacob's ladder.

359
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,140
And it goes all the way to heaven.

360
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:01,317
Welcome to my inner sanctum, Wallace.

361
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,919
My secret garden.

362
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,396
It's a veritable

363
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,095
vegetable paradise.

364
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,501
I just knew you'd love it.

365
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,267
Unlike Victor.

366
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,969
He's never shown
any interest in my produce.

367
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,945
- His loss, Lady Tottington.
- Please, Wallace.

368
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,377
Call me Totty.

369
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,623
If anything were to happen
to my vegetables,

370
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,426
I don't know what I'd do.

371
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,694
I'm sure you understand, Mr. Wallace.

372
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,133
I can see that you're
a true nature lover.

373
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,330
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

374
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,474
At first, I thought
I could change Victor.

375
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,601
Now I'm not so sure.

376
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,611
Do you think a man can change, Wallace?

377
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,342
Change?

378
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,714
Oh, yes.

379
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:10,049
Really, Phillip.
The things one does for love.

380
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,031
Pesto.

381
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,367
- Mr. Wallace.
- Oh, Totty.

382
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,642
Totty?

383
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,012
I'd like to show you one last thing.

384
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:38,180
Something no other man
has ever seen.

385
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,615
My carrot de Chantenay.

386
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,386
Just smell it, Wallace.

387
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,828
- Feel its silken flesh.
- Oh, yes.

388
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,857
Isn't it the most sumptuous,
succulent specimen you've ever seen?

389
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,995
- Yes!
- Doesn't it fill your heart

390
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,197
- with desire?
- Yes!

391
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,764
Just imagine
what it would taste like.

392
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,112
What on earth
were you thinkin' of, lad?

393
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:11,120
Ruined a perfectly good piece
of fashionable knitwear, that did.

394
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:15,090
To say nothing of a relationship
with an important client.

395
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:21,393
It's lucky for us her Ladyship
was so understanding.

396
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,398
Honestly, I don't know
what's got into you lately.

397
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,801
And slow down for pity's sake.

398
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,896
You'll buckle me trunnions.

399
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,175
Don't worry. I'll see to this.

400
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:43,319
You stay here where you belong.
In the doghouse.

401
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,452
Right.

402
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,660
It's heavier than it looks.

403
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,605
I know your little secret, Pesto.

404
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:09,646
- I know exactly what's going on.
- Your Lordship...

405
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,580
Yes. You think you can
pilfer my filly, don't you?

406
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,977
You think you can con
a woman out of her fortune?

407
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,647
- Who, me?
- Well, I got here first!

408
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:22,249
I've spent a long time reeling in
that fluffy-headed bunny-lover.

409
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:26,023
And I'm not about to let some
puddle-headed peasant poach her from me.

410
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,792
- Comprenez?
- Right-o.

411
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,857
I'll be off then. Ta-ta.

412
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,028
You're not going anywhere, Pesto.

413
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,066
Not until I've taught you
a jolly good lesson.

414
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,579
Come on! Queensberry rules!

415
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,641
Put 'em up, ya little pipsqueak.

416
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,414
You're shaking.

417
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,221
Don't tell me you're a scaredy-cat
as well as a scoundrel.

418
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,523
And don't think acting
like a big girl's blouse

419
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,364
will get you out of it.

420
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,997
There's no mercy
with Victor Quartermaine.

421
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,515
What the dickens?

422
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,326
What on earth...?

423
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,541
Phillip! Attack!

424
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,803
Attack!

425
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,803
What the...?

426
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,424
Vicar!

427
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:23,095
Vicar! Oh, where the devil is he?

428
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,435
Do you want to confess?

429
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,443
I want to talk to you about...

430
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,138
...the beast.

431
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:35,050
Everything you need
to know is in this book.

432
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:41,816
- "Nun Wrestling."
- No. I meant this one.

433
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,902
Here. Here it is.

434
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:04,471
The hideous monster
plaguing our parish.

435
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,142
The Were-Rabbit.

436
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,347
So it's true.

437
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,822
The beast lurks
within all of us, my child.

438
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:19,829
The side that emerges at night
as the moon rises into the sky.

439
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,162
The side that
savagely rips the leaves

440
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,701
off any innocent cabbage.

441
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,327
Spare me the sermon, Vicar.

442
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,340
Just tell me how I kill him.
I mean "it."

443
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,603
To kill such a creature

444
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,373
would require nerves of steel

445
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,243
and...

446
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,979
...a bullet.

447
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,609
A bullet?

448
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,846
A bullet.

449
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,917
A bull...

450
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,017
What kind of bullet?

451
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,793
A bullet of pure gold.

452
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,137
Gold.

453
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,672
Yes.

454
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,198
Twenty-four karat.

455
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,235
Get out of my way.

456
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,079
Silly old fool.

457
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,610
Beware!
Beware of the beast within!

458
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,041
Perfect re-entry, Gromit.

459
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,979
This veg diet's
doing the trick, eh, lad?

460
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,448
I feel smashing.

461
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,611
So how's our rabbit-monster?

462
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,119
Hope you're keeping an eye on him.

463
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,802
What's up, dog?

464
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,742
Well, fancy that.

465
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,045
Rabbit ears.

466
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,085
That is a bit odd.

467
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,953
And what are you tryin' to say, lad?

468
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,726
What?

469
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,628
What?

470
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:12,099
What? You think that I'm the...?

471
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,366
Because of these?

472
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,770
Oh, no.

473
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,400
No. This is just a reaction

474
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:22,707
to that healthy veg diet
you've got me on.

475
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,339
It's the toxins coming out.

476
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,713
Silly old pooch.

477
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,150
Thinking I'm the beast.

478
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,750
Next thing you'll be saying

479
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:37,021
is that Hutch
is turning into me.

480
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,029
Hey. What are you doing, lad?

481
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,399
Have you gone completely mad?

482
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,867
Cheese!

483
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,838
Cheese?

484
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:34,416
I do like a bit of Gorgonzola.

485
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,912
Oh, dear.

486
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,259
- Perfect.
- Ma'am.

487
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,854
- Now, let's see.
- Coming through!

488
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,493
The tombola's arrived.

489
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,696
And the bouncy Tottington Hall.

490
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,103
Splendid.

491
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,375
It's going to be such
a jolly competition tonight.

492
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:04,970
I just know it.

493
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,380
- Ya don't know nothin'.
- What?

494
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,817
The beast has struck again.
That's what.

495
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,355
That's right!

496
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,550
No, you're quite mistaken, Mrs. Mulch.

497
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,855
- The beast is in captivity.
- Oh, yeah?

498
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:21,625
Then just take a look
at my wife's brassicas.

499
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,667
- Ravaged in the night.
- But I don't understand.

500
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,362
- Anti-Pesto told me...
- A pack of lies!

501
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:30,304
It's not safe to bring
our vegetables here.

502
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,967
The show's off.

503
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,875
But this is simply dreadful news.

504
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,851
The Tottingtons have held
a giant vegetable competition

505
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:46,719
on this very night
for over 500 years.

506
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,690
That's right.

507
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:54,025
Not even the Great Duck Plague
of '53 stopped it.

508
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,461
If only there were another way.

509
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,836
What ho!

510
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,196
It's Quartermaine.

511
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,368
Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother.

512
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,612
Didn't this bit used to...?

513
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,647
Now. Now, let's see.

514
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,657
Where does this part go?

515
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,706
Oh, it's hopeless.

516
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,540
I'll never fix this flippin' machine.

517
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,104
Me mind's just a rabbit-y mush.

518
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,241
Oh, Gromit.

519
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,652
I don't wanna be a giant rabbit!

520
00:54:57,327 --> 00:55:01,058
The bounce is gone from his bungee.

521
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:17,711
Hey, presto! Rabbit rehabilitation.

522
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,308
But if I can't fix it...

523
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,282
Cheddar.

524
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,186
...maybe the other me can!

525
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,190
I'm inventing, mostly.

526
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:32,285
Look at me go! I'm a genius.

527
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:37,722
Awake! I can't answer the door.
Not like this.

528
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,828
Charming. I'm Wallace.

529
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,271
I already am!

530
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:44,862
Hutch!

531
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,774
Geronimo!

532
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,741
Wallace?

533
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,908
Hang on a mo'.

534
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,546
Wallace?

535
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,453
Hello? I say.
Open this door at once.

536
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,261
Totty.

537
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,853
Lady Tottington, if you don't mind.

538
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,991
I'm afraid I have some
rather bad news, Wallace.

539
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,558
Thing is, well,

540
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:18,300
you've rather let me down
with this beastly beast business.

541
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,776
- I suppose I have.
- Yes.

542
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,642
It's obvious to me
that you have absolutely no idea

543
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,340
where this poor creature is.

544
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,077
And I'm afraid
you've given me no option

545
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,678
but to let Victor
shoot the poor thing.

546
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,820
Shoot it?

547
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,526
Yes. Wasn't an easy choice,

548
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,926
but the veg competition
has to come first.

549
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:43,193
Besides, Victor's promised me
it won't suffer.

550
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,496
It will be quick and painless.

551
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,832
How thoughtful.

552
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,771
I cannot deny it was
a difficult decision for me.

553
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,468
Because I've recently developed...

554
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,033
Hurry!

555
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,377
...feelings for you.

556
00:56:57,447 --> 00:57:00,780
Feelings?
Oh, well, never mind, eh?

557
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,512
- Ta-ra, then.
- Wait! Wallace.

558
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,419
I haven't finished.
There's more that needs to be said.

559
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,753
Well, I'll give you a tinkle, shall l?

560
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:11,316
Can't we at least shake hands?
Part as friends?

561
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,885
It's not very convenient
at the moment.

562
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,794
Thanks for coming by.

563
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,697
Well, l... I...

564
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,448
That's right, my lovely.

565
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:41,047
You can say goodbye
to your fluffy lover-boy.

566
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,793
You gotta help me, Gromit!

567
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,887
Hide me. Anything.

568
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,955
Before it's too late!

569
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,557
Lad!

570
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,329
Your Lordship.

571
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,968
Good night, Gromit.

572
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,783
'Tis done.

573
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,492
My poor sensitive child.

574
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:33,832
Allow us all to share
in your moment of sorrow.

575
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,702
Yeah!

576
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,409
On with the show!

577
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,917
What the...?

578
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,197
Why you...

579
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,246
Of course.

580
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,576
The vegetable competition.

581
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,643
Your loyalty is moving.

582
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,316
Sadly, you won't be.

583
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,585
Come along, Phillip.

584
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,958
Everyone's been looking
forward to a good show.

585
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,725
Let's see they get one.

586
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,953
- Hooray!
- Mr. Growbag.

587
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:12,730
I... I have a hunch
this'll be a night to remember.

588
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,497
I just have a hunch.

589
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,597
All right. All right.
If we must do this flipping veg show,

590
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,439
Iet's do it in an orderly
and law-abiding fashion.

591
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,342
Cucumbers, give way to melons.

592
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,574
Carrots, wait your turn!

593
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,173
- Aubergines...
- There's our bait, Phillip.

594
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:32,915
All we have to do now is wait
for our fluffy friend to appear.

595
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,758
Look over here, everyone!
It's Victor!

596
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,193
- He's here!
- Our hero.

597
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,787
Please, sir, kiss my baby.

598
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,128
- Another time, perhaps.
- Kiss my potato.

599
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,930
- Not now.
- Kiss my artichoke.

600
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,402
- Look, just...
- Victor.

601
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,063
Campanula!

602
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:54,838
Victor, I have to know.
Did it suffer?

603
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,779
Of course not, my dear.
Not yet, anyway.

604
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,508
- Victor?
- Oy, you.

605
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,417
- Constable.
- Careful with them capsicums.

606
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:07,479
Listen, I don't want to cause panic,
but the beast isn't actually dead yet.

607
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,424
- The beast isn't actually dead yet?
- What?

608
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,600
Oops.

609
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:24,566
To the competition stand!

610
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,219
Cracking toast, Gromit.

611
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,823
I'm just crackers about cheese.

612
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,566
Monterey Jack.

613
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:08,472
Smashing Wensleydale.

614
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,064
Job well done, lad.

615
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,851
Quiet!

616
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:54,457
Quiet!

617
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,934
Now, listen carefully.

618
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,903
I've only got two...

619
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,372
I've only got one gold bullet left.

620
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,841
So leave this to me.

621
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,277
Yes, all right, I admit
the beast is still at large.

622
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:15,374
But the good news is your prize
vegetables are the perfect bait...

623
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:16,440
Bait?

624
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,783
...and will draw the creature
like a magnet.

625
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,379
- Keep still.
- My baby.

626
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:24,324
- There, there, love. It'll be all...
- Don't even move a muscle.

627
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:25,724
Mrs. Mulch! No!

628
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,164
It's not getting my baby!

629
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:34,901
Lovely food. For rabbits, that is.

630
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:42,177
- Come back!
- Come back!

631
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,277
Yes. Right on cue.

632
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,348
Come back!

633
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,920
Go away!

634
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:02,988
That's right. Come to Uncle Victor.

635
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,728
It's coming for us!

636
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,876
Bingo.

637
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,078
What the...?

638
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,949
Hurrah for Anti-Pesto!

639
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:33,689
- It's getting away!
- Get off, you stupid...

640
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,889
No!

641
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,968
Vicar, I need more gold bullets.

642
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,338
They don't come cheap, you know.

643
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,282
Victor? What are you doing?

644
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,651
I need it, my sweet. Emergency.

645
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:05,127
- Victor, no! Please!
- Come, now, Campanula, let go.

646
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,025
But it's my Golden Carrot Award.

647
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,064
This is hardly the time, my darling.

648
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,361
- Give it to me this instant!
- But Victor!

649
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,097
Cheese, Gromit.

650
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,311
The Golden Carrot belongs in the show!

651
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,542
No, the Golden Carrot
belongs in the Were-Rabbit.

652
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,582
Every man for himself!

653
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:34,419
Help! Help! Help me!

654
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,984
Put me down at once,
you great big hairy thing, you!

655
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,824
Stop! Stop!

656
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:44,627
Mob supplies!
Get your angry mob supplies here.

657
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,581
Put her down, you great ugly brute!

658
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,054
I'll bagsy the lucky rabbit's foot.

659
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,256
Help me, someone! Help me!

660
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,159
Yes.

661
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:33,574
No. No, no, no!

662
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:55,229
Put me down! Put me down, you...

663
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,204
Whatever you are! Help!

664
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,004
What is it?

665
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,878
What are you staring at
with those beastly eyes?

666
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,980
Wallace.

667
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,983
Oh, Wallace.

668
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,747
What ever have you done to yourself?

669
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:49,354
Well, don't you worry.
I'll protect you.

670
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:55,462
Get your hairy mitts off
my future wife, you big brute.

671
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:58,557
No! Victor!

672
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,033
You don't understand.
The hunt is off.

673
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,504
It's... We made a terrible mistake.

674
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,972
No. You commissioned me
to rid you of Pesto,

675
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,532
and that's just
what I intend to do.

676
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,577
Pesto?

677
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:18,717
Why, you knew
it was Wallace all along.

678
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,255
Oh, all right.

679
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,382
So what if it is that blithering idiot.

680
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,359
No one will ever believe you.

681
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:33,497
And if I can't have your money,
I can still bag your bunny.

682
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,138
My eyes!

683
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,644
Run, rabbit, run!

684
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,020
I rather like your hair pinned back.

685
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:55,386
No, Victor, no! Stop! Please!

686
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,890
Victor!

687
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:01,290
You can hop,
but you can't hide, Pesto.

688
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,370
Beware the moon!

689
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,923
Stupid interfering mutt.

690
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:12,628
Stand back! There may be
a large rabbit dropping!

691
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:33,514
Looks like the buck stops here.

692
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,245
Eat karat, bunny boy!

693
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:05,504
Potty poo!

694
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:40,448
No one beats Victor Quartermaine!

695
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,541
Is that so?

696
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:46,077
Consider yourself dumped.

697
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,896
He's in there!

698
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,764
- There he is!
- Surround him!

699
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,463
There he is! Over there!

700
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,301
Phillip, help me! Phillip!

701
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:09,935
Do something.

702
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:17,349
Destroy! Drive out the monstrosity!

703
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,422
Well, let's see how he likes it.

704
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,990
Wallace?

705
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,161
Oh, Gromit.

706
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,673
Well, at least now he's at peace.

707
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,209
The rabbit's gone.

708
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,980
If only there were a way
to bring back Wallace.

709
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:35,191
Lovely cheese, Gromit.

710
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:39,823
Gromit?

711
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:43,028
Don't forget the crackers.

712
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,846
Cheese?

713
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,543
Cheese!

714
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:01,851
It's me again. I'm back!

715
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,882
Gromit! You clever mutt.

716
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,861
Well done, old pal!

717
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,261
- Totty!
- Wallace! You're...

718
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:20,669
Thanks, lad.

719
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,972
Oh, look!

720
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:30,245
Well, I think
you deserve this, Gromit.

721
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,221
For a brave and splendid melon.

722
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,188
We've all got a lot to thank you for.

723
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,753
Every dog has his day.

724
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,594
And thank you, Wallace.

725
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:48,534
You've saved me
from a terrible marriage.

726
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:50,732
All the same,

727
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,674
it is going to be rather lonely
at Tottington Hall now.

728
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,142
Unless...

729
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:03,943
I have a little proposal
for you, Wallace.

730
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:12,324
I'm so thrilled you agreed
to go through with this.

731
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:15,192
My pleasure, Totty.

732
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,398
One for the album, Gromit.

733
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:28,769
I declare this bunny sanctuary
officially open.

734
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,413
When you're ready, lad.

735
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,044
Fire up the old BV6000.

736
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,056
Oh, it's simply marvelous.

737
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:55,536
My home, a safe haven
for all things fluffy.

738
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,669
I do hope you'll still
come visit, Wallace.

739
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:08,273
I'd rather got used to
having you around.

740
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,943
There'll always be a part of me

741
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,886
here at Tottington Hall.

742
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,491
Give it some more welly, lad.

743
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:29,336
Cheese!
