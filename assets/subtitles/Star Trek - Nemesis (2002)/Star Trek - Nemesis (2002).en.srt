1
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,353
Senators, consider the opportunities
for the Empire.

2
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:50,026
At last, the destinies of the planets
Romulus and Remus will be united.

3
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,612
Shinzon of Remus
is offering us a chance

4
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,198
to make ourselves stronger
than ever before.

5
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,992
It would be madness to reject it.

6
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:03,706
I beg you not to let prejudice or politics

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,000
interfere with this alliance.

8
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,877
By joining Shinzon's forces with ours,

9
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,713
not even the Federation
will be able to stand in our way...

10
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,299
That's enough!

11
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,634
The decision has been made.

12
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,805
The military does not
dictate policy on Romulus.

13
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:23,225
The Senate has considered
Shinzon's proposal and rejected it.

14
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,562
He and his followers will be met with
all deliberate force

15
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,649
and sent back to that black rock
they came from.

16
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,528
-Do I make myself clear?
-Yes, sir.

17
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,625
If you will excuse me, Praetor.

18
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,002
I have an appointment
with the Tholian ambassador.

19
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,795
Of course.

20
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,718
Senators, are there any others
who wish to speak?

21
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,932
Then I call for a vote on the motion to
open trade negotiations with Celes II.

22
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,685
As you know, the Reman mines

23
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,062
have not been filling their quotas
for months now.

24
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,481
I hope that you will all bear in mind
the trade committee's findings.

25
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,651
As much as we don't want...

26
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,764
Would someone alert security?

27
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,018
Bring back Senator Tal'Aura.

28
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:18,673
Duty.

29
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,178
A starship captain's life
is filled with solemn duty.

30
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,182
I have commanded men in battle.

31
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:31,144
I have negotiated peace treaties
between implacable enemies.

32
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,855
I have represented the Federation

33
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,526
in first contact with 27 alien species.

34
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,656
But none of this compares
with my solemn duty today

35
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,367
as best man.

36
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,956
Now, I know on an occasion
such as this,

37
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,124
it is expected that I be gracious

38
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,088
and fulsome in my praise
on the wonders of this blessed union.

39
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,216
But have the two of you
considered what you are doing to me?

40
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,553
Of course you're happy,
but what about my needs?

41
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,516
This is all a damned inconvenience.

42
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,019
While you're happily settling in
on the Titan,

43
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,442
I will be training my new First Officer.
You all know him.

44
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,903
He's a tyrannical martinet
who will never

45
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,656
ever allow me to go on away missions.

46
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,994
That is the regulation, sir.
Starfleet Code, Section 12, Paragraph...

47
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,911
-Mr. Data.
-Sir?

48
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,788
-Shut up.
-Yes, sir.

49
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,252
Fifteen years
I've been waiting to say that.

50
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,463
No, seriously.

51
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,843
Will, Deanna,
there's still time to reconsider.

52
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,218
Yes?

53
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,680
-No.
-No.

54
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,725
No? Oh, very well, then.

55
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,608
Will Riker, you have been
my trusted right arm for 15 years.

56
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:04,154
You have kept my course
true and steady.

57
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,786
Deanna Troi, you've been my guide
and my conscience.

58
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,540
You've helped me recognize
the better parts of myself.

59
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,752
You are my family.

60
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,298
And in best maritime tradition,

61
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,427
I wish you both clear horizons.

62
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,264
My good friends, make it so.

63
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,476
The bride and groom.

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,478
-To the bride and groom.
-To the bride and groom.

65
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,665
You ever think about
getting married again?

66
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,709
No. Twenty-three was my limit.

67
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,632
Worf?

68
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,720
-Are you all right?
-Romulan ale should be illegal.

69
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,680
It is.

70
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,435
-That was a lovely toast.
-It was from the heart.

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,728
And you needn't worry.

72
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:20,730
I'm going to brief your new counselor
on everything she needs to know.

73
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,860
Oh, like hell you are.
You already know too much about me.

74
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,697
I take it that there will be no speeches
during the ceremony on Betazed?

75
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,867
No. No speeches and no clothes.

76
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,749
Ladies and gentlemen
and invited transgendered species,

77
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,752
in my study of Terran
and Betazoid conjugal rites

78
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,341
I've discovered it is traditional
to present the happy couple

79
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,218
with a gift.

80
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,639
Given Commander Riker's affection
for archaic musical forms,

81
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,891
I have elected to present the following
as my gift

82
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,519
in honor of their conjugation.

83
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,730
Conjugation!

84
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,108
Never saw the sun shining so bright

85
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,737
Never saw things going so right

86
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,074
Noticing the days hurrying by

87
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:16,161
When you're in love, my how they fly

88
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:21,167
Blue skies
Smiling at me

89
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,043
Irving Berlin.

90
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:28,132
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

91
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,366
It's tradition, Worf.

92
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,786
You, of all people,
should appreciate that.

93
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,621
I will not do it.

94
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,831
Won't do what, Mr. Worf?

95
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:04,210
Captain, I do not think it is appropriate

96
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,671
for a Starfleet officer to appear naked.

97
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,964
Oh, come now.

98
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,302
A big, handsome, strapping fellow
like you? What can you be afraid of?

99
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,227
Captain, I'm picking up
an unusual electromagnetic signature

100
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,854
from the Kolarin system.

101
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,191
-What sort of signature?
-Positronic.

102
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,451
It's very faint.

103
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:41,120
But I've isolated it to the third planet
in the Kolarin system.

104
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,414
-What do we know about it?
-Uncharted.

105
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,251
We'll have to get closer
for a more detailed scan.

106
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,336
Theories?

107
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,922
Since positronic signatures
have only been known to emanate

108
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,590
from androids such as myself,

109
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,469
it is logical to theorize
there is an android on Kolarus III.

110
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,221
Just what I was afraid of. Captain,

111
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,349
diverting to the Kolarin system

112
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,059
takes us awfully close
to the Romulan Neutral Zone.

113
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,524
It's still well on our side. I think...

114
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,154
I think it's worth taking a look.
Don't worry, Number One.

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,950
We'll still have you to Betazed
with plenty of time to spare.

116
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,158
Thank you, sir.

117
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,996
Where we will all honor
the Betazoid tradition.

118
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,958
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the gym.

119
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:37,720
Mr. Branson, lay in a course
for the Kolarin system, warp 5.

120
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,768
What do you think, Data?
A long-lost relative?

121
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,581
I'm reading six distinct
positronic signatures

122
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,207
spread out over a few kilometers
on the planet's surface.

123
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,586
What do we know
about the population of Kolarus III?

124
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,712
Isolated pockets of humanoids.

125
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,840
It appears to be a pre-warp civilization

126
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:17,509
at an early stage
of industrial development.

127
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,636
Captain, I wouldn't recommend
using the transporter.

128
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,847
That ion storm
doesn't look very neighborly.

129
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,100
It could head in our direction
without much warning.

130
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,309
Understood.

131
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:36,486
-Data, Mr. Worf, you're with me.
-Captain, I don't have to remind you...

132
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,905
I appreciate your concern, Number One.

133
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,118
-But I've been itching to try the Argo.
-I'll bet.

134
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,913
Captain's prerogative.
There's no foreseeable danger.

135
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:51,418
And your wife would never forgive me
if anything were to happen to you.

136
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,462
You have the Bridge, Mr. Troi.

137
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,283
I will always be puzzled
by the human predilection

138
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,369
for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.

139
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,793
Over that rise, sir. Half a kilometer.

140
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,154
The radiant electromagnetic field
is interfering with my tricorder.

141
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,698
We are within a few meters
of the signal.

142
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,409
Fan out. Let's search around.

143
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,912
-It appears to be a robotic arm.
-Very astute.

144
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,249
Mr. Worf, bring it to the vehicle.

145
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,573
This doesn't feel right.

146
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,168
The final signature is approximately
100 meters to the north, sir.

147
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:52,908
It's you.

148
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,246
The resemblance is striking.

149
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,594
-Fascinating.
-Fascinating.

150
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,557
To the vehicle.

151
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,860
I think it's time
to try some unsafe velocities.

152
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,130
Why do you have a shiny head?

153
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,342
This is not the appropriate time
for a conversation.

154
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,469
Why?

155
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:54,804
Because the Captain has to
concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

156
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,097
-Why?
-Because...

157
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,224
Data!

158
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,600
Sorry, sir.

159
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,271
Have I said something wrong?

160
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,442
Data.

161
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:50,336
-That's negative 3, cos/bar standard.
-Valve transfer initiated.

162
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:55,217
You know, all things considered, Data,
I think you have nicer eyes.

163
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,430
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

164
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,476
So what have we got, Geordi?

165
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,270
I'd say he has the same
internal mechanics as Data

166
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,272
but not as much
positronic development.

167
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,858
The neural pathways
aren't nearly as sophisticated.

168
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,903
I'd say he's a prototype.

169
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,696
Something Dr. Soong created
prior to Data.

170
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,534
Do you have a name, sir?

171
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,744
I am B-4.

172
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,664
B-4?

173
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,836
Dr. Soong's penchant for whimsical
names seems to have no end.

174
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,757
Can you tell us how you came to be
on the planet where we found you?

175
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,384
I do not know.

176
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,680
Do you remember anything of your life
before you were on the planet?

177
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:46,433
No. Why does the tall man
have a furry face?

178
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,191
Number One, keep me informed.
And, Geordi, reassemble him.

179
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,401
Aye, sir.

180
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,074
B-4, do you know who I am?

181
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,326
You are me.

182
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,121
No.

183
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,249
My name is Data.

184
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,335
I am your brother.

185
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,508
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

186
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:26,641
Captain, you have
an Alpha Priority communication

187
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,144
-from Starfleet Command.
-Acknowledged.

188
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,277
Admiral Janeway,
how good to see you again.

189
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,989
Jean-Luc. How would you like
a trip to Romulus?

190
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,951
-With or without the rest of the fleet?
-A diplomatic mission.

191
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,494
We've been invited, believe it or not.

192
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,999
Seems there's been some kind of
internal political shake-up.

193
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,710
The new Praetor,
someone called Shinzon,

194
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,128
has requested a Federation envoy.

195
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,008
-New Praetor?
-Here's more. He's Reman.

196
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,303
Believe me,
we don't understand it, either.

197
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:04,804
You're the closest ship.

198
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,097
So I want you to go and hear
what he has to say.

199
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,933
Get the lay of the land.

200
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,520
If the Empire becomes unstable, it could
mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

201
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,730
Understood.

202
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,275
We're sending you
all the intelligence we have.

203
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,027
But it's not much.

204
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,029
I don't need to tell you
to watch your back, Jean-Luc.

205
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,405
Hardly.

206
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,034
The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans.

207
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,037
You seem to get
all the easy assignments.

208
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,788
Just lucky, Admiral.

209
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,959
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.

210
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,679
Helmsman, lay in a new course.
Take us to Romulus. Warp 8.

211
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,224
-Aye-aye, sir. Course plotted and laid in.
-Romulus?

212
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,060
I'm afraid The Opal Sea
will have to wait, Number One.

213
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,354
Engage.

214
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,953
As you can see, one side of Remus
always faces the sun.

215
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,039
Due to the extreme temperatures
on that half of their world,

216
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,835
the Remans live
on the dark side of the planet.

217
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:21,088
Almost nothing is known
of the Reman homeworld,

218
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,008
although intelligence scans
have proven

219
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,720
the existence of dilithium mining
and heavy weapons construction.

220
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:30,472
The Remans themselves
are considered

221
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,476
an undesirable caste
in the hierarchy of the Empire.

222
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,855
But they also have a reputation
for being formidable warriors.

223
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,191
In the Dominion War, Reman troops
were used as assault forces

224
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,692
in the most violent encounters.

225
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,111
Cannon fodder.

226
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:46,905
Yeah, but how did a Reman
get to be Praetor? I don't get it.

227
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,241
We have to assume
he had Romulan collaborators.

228
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,535
Coup d'état?

229
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,871
The Praetor's power
has always been the Romulan fleet.

230
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,124
They must have been behind Shinzon
for him to have overthrown the Senate.

231
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,209
What have we learned about Shinzon?

232
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,420
Starfleet intelligence
was only able to provide

233
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:02,713
a partial account of his military record.

234
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,884
We can infer he is relatively young
and a capable commander.

235
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,554
He fought 12 major engagements
in the war. All successful.

236
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,346
Beyond that, we know nothing.

237
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,894
Well, it seems as though
we're truly sailing into the unknown.

238
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,441
Keep at it. Anything you can give me
will be appreciated. Dismissed.

239
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,153
I still can't believe the Captain
went along with a memory download.

240
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,991
Captain Picard agrees that the B-4
was probably designed

241
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,496
with the same self-actualization
parameters as myself.

242
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,250
If my memory engrams are successfully
integrated into his positronic matrix,

243
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,753
he should have all my abilities.

244
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,215
Yeah. But he would also have
all of your memories as well.

245
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:50,345
-You feel comfortable with that?
-I feel nothing, Geordi.

246
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,722
It is my belief
that with my memory engrams

247
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,268
he'll be able to function
as a more complete individual.

248
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,855
-An individual more like you, you mean?
-Yes.

249
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,028
Maybe he's not supposed
to be like you, Data.

250
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,199
Maybe he's supposed to be
exactly the way he is.

251
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,492
That might be so.

252
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:17,704
But I believe he should have
the opportunity to explore his potential.

253
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,794
Okay. We're done.

254
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,887
B-4, do you know where you are?

255
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,724
I am in a room with lights.

256
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,397
Can you remember our father?

257
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,777
-Our father?
-Yes. Dr. Soong.

258
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,363
No.

259
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,075
Do you know the name of the Captain
of this vessel?

260
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,287
Captain... No.

261
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,585
Data, he's assimilating
a lot of programming.

262
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,337
Remember, he's a prototype,
a lot less sophisticated than you are.

263
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,923
We just don't know if his matrix
will be able to adapt.

264
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,301
We really need to give him some time.

265
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,431
Geordi, what purpose does this serve?

266
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,641
-What?
-This.

267
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,894
That's a redundant memory port.

268
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:26,273
Maybe the provisional memory storage
is in case his neural pathways overload.

269
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,109
Do you mind if I keep him here
for a while?

270
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,444
Run a few diagnostics?

271
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,905
No, I do not mind.

272
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,865
Data.

273
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,368
No. You must remain
with Commander La Forge.

274
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,829
He is going to try to help you.

275
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,968
Captain's Log. Stardate 56844.9.

276
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,887
The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus

277
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:59,891
and is waiting
at the designated coordinates.

278
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,602
All our hails have gone unanswered.

279
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,939
We've been waiting for 17 hours.

280
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,490
-Counselor?
-They're out there, sir.

281
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,926
Captain, I recommend we raise shields.

282
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,552
Not yet, Mr. Worf.

283
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,432
Captain, with all due respect
to diplomatic protocol,

284
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,769
the Federation Council
isn't sitting out here, we are.

285
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,522
Patience. Diplomacy
is a very exacting occupation.

286
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,817
-We will wait.
-Captain.

287
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,450
-Raising shields.
-No.

288
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,244
-Captain.
-Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf.

289
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,875
Fifty-two disruptor banks,
27 photon torpedo bays,

290
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,170
primary and secondary shields.

291
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,799
She's a predator.

292
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,189
We are being hailed.

293
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:32,232
On-screen.

294
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,948
Enterprise,

295
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,162
we are the Reman warbird, Scimitar.

296
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,875
-Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
-I am not Shinzon.

297
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,170
I am his viceroy.

298
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,507
We are sending transport coordinates.

299
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:04,222
-Not very chatty.
-Away team, Transporter Room 4.

300
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:53,647
I hope you'll forgive the darkness.

301
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,027
We are not comfortable in the light.

302
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,990
-Praetor Shinzon?
-Captain Picard.

303
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,871
Jean-Luc Picard.

304
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,336
I'd always imagined you a little taller.
Isn't that odd?

305
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,342
Now, you may scan me
without subterfuge, Commander Data.

306
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,275
-You are not as we imagined you.
-No?

307
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,067
You are human.

308
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:47,034
Why have you asked us to come here?

309
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,954
Praetor?

310
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:56,042
-I've never met a human woman before.
-I'm only half human.

311
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,630
Deanna Troi of Betazed.

312
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,594
Empathic and telepathic abilities.
Ship's counselor.

313
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:09,265
All this I knew.
But I never knew you were so beautiful.

314
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,143
You seem quite familiar
with our personnel.

315
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,353
Oh, I am, Commander Riker.

316
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,148
May I touch your hair?

317
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:22,737
We came to Romulus on a matter we
were assured was of great importance.

318
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,739
If you have anything to say to us

319
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,576
as representatives of the Federation,
I suggest you do it now.

320
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:32,579
Yes. I'm sorry, Captain.

321
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,333
There is so much we need to talk about.

322
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,169
I would be interested to know
what we are talking about.

323
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:40,212
Unity, Captain.

324
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:45,593
Tearing down the walls between us
to recognize that we are one.

325
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,932
I'm talking of the thing
that makes us the same.

326
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,435
Peace. We want peace.

327
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,278
Right now you're thinking
this all sounds too good to be true,

328
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,489
but you're also thinking

329
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,784
that the chance for peace
is too promising to ignore.

330
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,871
Am I right?

331
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,959
Yes.

332
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:22,255
Then, perhaps it's time to add
some illumination to our discussion.

333
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,633
Computer, raise the lighting four levels.

334
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:44,568
When I was very young,
I was stricken with an odd disease.

335
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,073
I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.

336
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,742
Even the slightest whisper
caused me agony.

337
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,828
No one could do anything about it.

338
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:59,375
Finally, I was taken to a doctor who had
some experience of Terran illnesses.

339
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,169
And he diagnosed me
with Shalaft's Syndrome.

340
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,673
Do you know of it, Captain?

341
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,306
Yes.

342
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,518
Then you know
it's a very rare syndrome.

343
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,519
Genetic.

344
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,317
Apparently, all the male members
of a family have it.

345
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:30,155
Eventually, I was treated and now
I can hear as well as you can, Captain.

346
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,201
I can see as well as you can.

347
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:38,455
I can feel everything you feel.

348
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,584
In fact,

349
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,338
I feel exactly what you feel.

350
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,383
Don't I, Jean-Luc?

351
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,640
Come to dinner tomorrow on Romulus.
Just the two of us.

352
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,603
Or should I say, just the one of us?

353
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:18,578
I think you'll be wanting this.

354
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,086
Until tomorrow then, Captain.
We have much to discuss.

355
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,510
Computer, return lighting
to previous level.

356
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,042
There's no doubt, Captain.

357
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,463
Right down to your aggressive
strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.

358
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,090
He's a clone.

359
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,635
They probably used a hair follicle
or a skin cell.

360
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:19,222
-Why?
-I intend to find out, Number One.

361
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:22,809
Inform Starfleet of the situation.

362
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,980
I need to know
where the hell he came from.

363
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,233
Counselor.

364
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,574
We supported you, Shinzon,
when you assassinated the Senate.

365
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:40,161
You told us the timing was perfect
for an attack on the Federation.

366
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,246
I don't understand why now you delay.

367
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,498
You don't have to understand.

368
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,460
And bringing the Enterprise here,

369
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,420
what possible purpose
could that serve?

370
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:52,840
-I have a purpose.
-Then, perhaps you'll enlighten us.

371
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,425
Silence, Romulan!

372
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:05,936
You really must learn patience,
Commander.

373
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,692
Spend 18 hours every day
under the lash of a Romulan guard

374
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,320
and you'll soon understand patience.

375
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,324
Now go.

376
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,418
Commander Donatra.

377
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:32,838
Please remain.

378
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:45,059
There's a word I want you to consider.

379
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:50,815
Allegiance. It's something I demand
from those who serve me.

380
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,567
-Do I serve you?
-Yes.

381
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,737
And, I think, faithfully.

382
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,074
Commander Suran, on the other hand,

383
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,827


gives me pause.

384
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,579
Here's another word, Praetor.

385
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:08,833
Trust.

386
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,920
Do you trust me?

387
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,757
How far does that trust extend?

388
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,594
How deep does it go?

389
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,559
What must a commander do
to prove herself faithful to you?

390
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,021
What must a woman do?

391
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,068
You are not a woman.

392
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,153
You are a Romulan.

393
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:43,284
Serve me faithfully
and you will be rewarded.

394
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,956
Keep those lovely eyes
on Commander Suran.

395
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,960
And at the first sign of treachery...

396
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,592
Dispose of him?

397
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,512
Then you will have proven yourself.

398
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:12,646
Now go.

399
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,824
And, Commander,

400
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,414
if you ever touch me again,

401
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,460
I'll kill you.

402
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,159
The Romulans had somehow
gained possession of your DNA

403
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,371
and I had been created.

404
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:56,916
And when I was ready,
they were going to replace you with me.

405
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,588
Put a Romulan agent
at the heart of Starfleet.

406
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,425
-It was a bold plan.
-What happened?

407
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,677
As happens frequently on Romulus,

408
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:12,432
a new government came to power.
They decided to abandon the plan.

409
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,686
They were afraid
that I might be discovered

410
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,771
and that it would lead to war.

411
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,902
Not quite the face you remember.

412
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,072
Not quite.

413
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,242
A lifetime of violence will do that.

414
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,704
They broke my nose, my jaw.

415
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,373
But so much is the same.

416
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,876
The eyes.

417
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,130
-Surely you recognize the eyes?
-Yes.

418
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,134
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?

419
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,929
And yours are so confident.

420
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,521
So, I'm not as tall as you expected?

421
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,275
I had always hoped
I might hit two meters.

422
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,860
As had I.

423
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,657
How did you end up on Remus?

424
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,913
They sent me there to die.

425
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:21,001
How could a mere human survive
the dilithium mines?

426
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,545
Not that it mattered

427
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,132
as I was no longer part of their plans
against the Federation.

428
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,512
In those terrible depths
lived only the damned.

429
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,224
Together with the Reman slaves,

430
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,768
I was condemned to an existence
of unceasing labor and starvation

431
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,813
under the brutal heel
of the Romulan guards.

432
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,192
Only the very strongest
had any hope of survival.

433
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,237
I was only a child when they took me.

434
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,907
Then I didn't see the sun or the stars
again for nearly 10 years.

435
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:59,373
The only thing the Romulan guards
hated more than the Remans

436
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,250
was me.

437
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:08,798
But one man took pity on me.

438
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,302
The man that became my viceroy.

439
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,224
He protected me
from the cruelty of the guards

440
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,561
and taught me how to survive.

441
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:25,273
And in that dark place
where there was nothing of myself,

442
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,402
I found my Reman brothers.

443
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,492
They showed me the only true kindness
I've ever known.

444
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:38,202
You're doing this
to liberate the Remans?

445
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,081
That is the single thought
behind everything I have done.

446
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,253
From building the Scimitarat a secret
base to assembling my army.

447
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:48,380
Finally, coming to Romulus in force.

448
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,010
I knew they would never give us
our freedom. I would have to take it.

449
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,262
How many Romulans died
for your freedom?

450
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,391
Too many.

451
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:04,521
But the point is that finally the Empire
is realizing that there is a better way.

452
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,940
And that way is peace.

453
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:16,449
-You don't trust me.
-I have no reason to.

454
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,827
You have every reason.

455
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,916
If you had lived my life and experienced
the suffering of my people

456
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,710
you'd be standing where I am.

457
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:28,045
And if you had lived my life

458
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,088
you would understand
my responsibility to the Federation.

459
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:36,010
I cannot allow my personal feelings
to unduly influence my decisions.

460
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:39,472
All I have are my personal feelings.

461
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,023
I want to know
what it means to be human.

462
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,485
The Remans have given me a future.

463
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:57,157
-But you can tell me about my past.
-I can tell you about my past.

464
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:03,829
-Were we Picards always warriors?
-I think of myself as an explorer.

465
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,791
Were we always explorers?

466
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,838
I was the first Picard
to leave our solar system.

467
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,509
It caused quite a stir in the family.

468
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:20,054
But I'd spent my youth...

469
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:25,059
Looking up at the stars, dreaming
about what was up there, about...

470
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,644
New worlds.

471
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,494
I'm trying to believe you, Shinzon.

472
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,753
If there is one ideal that
the Federation holds most dear,

473
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,922
it is that all men,

474
00:43:55,757 --> 00:43:57,842
all races, can be united.

475
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,262
What better example?

476
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:06,393
A Starfleet captain
standing in the Romulan Senate.

477
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:15,068
Nothing would make me more proud
than to take your hand in friendship.

478
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,739
In time.

479
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,826
When that trust has been earned.

480
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:31,168
Captain, we have had an unauthorized
access into the main computer.

481
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,376
Source?

482
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,755
It's gonna take some time
to figure that out, Captain.

483
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,050
The data stream was re-routed
through sub-stations all over the ship.

484
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:42,429
-What programs were accessed?
-That's what I can't figure out.

485
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,139
It's mostly just basic stellar cartography.

486
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,476
Star charts, communications protocols,

487
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,226
some uplinks
from colony tracking stations.

488
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,146
It's not even restricted material.

489
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,981
Nevertheless, we must learn the source.
Keep me informed.

490
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,193
Captain, there's something else.

491
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,780
I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Look at this.

492
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,199
When the Scimitarde-cloaked,

493
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,952
there was a momentary spike
in the tertiary EM band. There.

494
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:11,123
You're not going to believe this.
It's thalaron.

495
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,130
I thought thalaron radiation
was theoretical.

496
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,717
Which is why our initial scans didn't
pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.

497
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,054
Thalaron research
was banned in the Federation

498
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,014
because of its biogenic properties.

499
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,143
It has the ability to consume organic
material at the subatomic level.

500
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:34,313
I can't overestimate the danger
of thalaron radiation, Jean-Luc.

501
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,108
A microscopic amount could kill
every living thing

502
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,902
on this ship in a matter of seconds.

503
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:40,987
I understand. Keep on it.

504
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:45,157
I want to know what he has
and how we can neutralize any threat.

505
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,992
I need options.

506
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,135
This was a mistake.
We're wasting time.

507
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,304
My time.

508
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,641
And I shall spend it how I choose.

509
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:12,268
Do not forget our mission, Shinzon.

510
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,813
We must act. Now.

511
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,197
We'll return to the Scimitar.

512
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:28,076
I was merely curious about him.

513
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,592
Come.

514
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,762
Beverly, come in.

515
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,436
Remember him?

516
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,568
-He was a bit cocky, as I recall.
-He was a damned fool.

517
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:05,697
Selfish. Ambitious.
Very much in need of seasoning.

518
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,699
He turned out all right.

519
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,246
I really wanted to believe Shinzon.

520
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:20,170
But this thalaron radiation
just can't be explained away.

521
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,467
Whatever he's after, it isn't peace.

522
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,929
Is he very much the way you were?

523
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,768
Oh, yes.

524
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,438
-Data to Captain Picard.
-Go ahead, Data.

525
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:39,563
Captain,

526
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:43,818
Geordi and I have identified the source
of the unauthorized computer access.

527
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,364
And I believe we have found a way
to gain a tactical advantage.

528
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,782
On my way.

529
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,170
Will?

530
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,342
As ship's counselor,
I recommend you get some sleep.

531
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:11,972
Some honeymoon.

532
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,143
Come to bed.

533
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:21,981
Imzadi.

534
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,465
Imzadi.

535
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,344
He can never know you as I can.

536
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,097
He can never touch you as I can.

537
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:58,351
-This isn't real!
-Then feel my lips.

538
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,527
I'm with you, imzadi.

539
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,864
I'll always be with you now.

540
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,744
-This isn't real!
-Deanna, what's the matter?

541
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,077
-No!
-Deanna?

542
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,873
-Deanna!
-No!

543
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,253
The bond has been broken.

544
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,050
Find her again.

545
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,389
Praetor,

546
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:39,099
we've received the transponder signal.

547
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:54,407
It's accelerating.
You have no more time for games.

548
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,746
Have the doctors prepare.

549
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:16,304
Transport.

550
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,273
Begin the download.

551
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,460
Tea, hot.

552
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,894
Aside from slightly elevated levels
of adrenalin and serotonin,

553
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,856
you're perfectly normal.

554
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,155
Deanna, can you describe it?

555
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,989
It was...

556
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,327
It was a violation.

557
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:27,083
Shinzon's viceroy seems to have
the ability to reach into my thoughts.

558
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:31,170
I've become a liability.
I request to be relieved of my duties.

559
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,172
Permission denied.

560
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:37,677
If you can endure more of
these assaults, I need you at my side.

561
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:39,429
Now more than ever.

562
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,347
The Enterprise
is far from Federation space...

563
00:51:45,643 --> 00:51:46,853
Worf, shields up!

564
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,865
Hello, Jean-Luc.

565
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:04,161
Why am I here?
Why have you done this?

566
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,164
I was lonely.

567
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,346
-What are you going to do?
-I need a sample of your blood.

568
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:27,434
What is it your Borg friends say?
"Resistance is futile."

569
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,985
Oh, yes, the android.

570
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:43,117
-The bait you couldn't refuse.
-All of this so you could capture me?

571
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,954
Don't be so vain.

572
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,458
After we found it,
we had to make a few modifications.

573
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,588
An extra memory port,
a hidden transponder.

574
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,425
I've now gained access
to Starfleet's communications protocol.

575
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,221
I now know the exact location
of your entire fleet.

576
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:07,976
-You may go.
-Where?

577
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,271
Out of my sight.

578
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,360
What is all this about?

579
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,114
It's about destiny, Picard.

580
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,909
-It's about a Reman outcast.
-You're not Reman!

581
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:30,123
And I'm not quite human. So what am I?

582
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:35,460
My life is meaningless
as long as you're still alive.

583
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,340
What am I while you exist?

584
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,135
A shadow? An echo?

585
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:46,054
If your issues are with me,
then deal with me.

586
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,559
This has nothing to do with my ship.
Nothing to do with the Federation.

587
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,476
But it does.

588
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:55,148
We will no longer
bow before anyone as slaves.

589
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:58,985
Not the Romulans,
and not your mighty Federation.

590
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:02,905
We are a race bred for war.

591
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,074
And conquest.

592
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:09,244
Are you ready to plunge
the entire quadrant into war

593
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,206
to satisfy your own personal demons?

594
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,751
It amazes me
how little you know yourself.

595
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,380
-I'm incapable of such an act.
-You are me.

596
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:28,389
The same noble Picard blood
runs through our veins.

597
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,936
Had you lived my life,
you'd be doing exactly as I am.

598
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:39,525
So look in the mirror. See yourself.

599
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,530
Consider that, Captain.

600
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,784
I can think of no greater torment for you.

601
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:57,251
Shinzon.

602
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,838
I'm a mirror for you as well.

603
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,594
Not for long, Captain.

604
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,347
I'm afraid you won't survive to witness

605
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:13,141
the victory of the echo over the voice.

606
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,161
His cloak is perfect.

607
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,623
No tachyon emissions,
no residual antiprotons.

608
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,333
Keep at it, Geordi. Find a way in.

609
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,764
Praetor Shinzon needs the prisoner.

610
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,737
-About time, Mr. Data.
-My mission was a success, sir.

611
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,824
I've located the source of the radiation.

612
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,452
This entire ship
is essentially a thalaron generator.

613
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,371
Its power relays lead
to an activation matrix on the Bridge.

614
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,791
-It's a weapon.
-It would appear so.

615
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,251
What about the download?

616
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,045
Shinzon believes he has
our communication protocols.

617
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,340
They will give him inaccurate locations
for all Starfleet vessels.

618
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,092
-Good work.
-Sir.

619
00:56:31,512 --> 00:56:35,557
Geordi supplied me with a prototype
for the Emergency Transport Unit.

620
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,313
I recommend you use this, sir,
to return to the Enterprise.

621
00:56:40,813 --> 00:56:44,150
-It'll only work for one of us.
-Yes, sir.

622
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:53,992
We'll find a way off together.

623
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,592
It is time for the procedure.

624
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,943
Move, puny human animal.

625
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,612
A bit less florid, Data.

626
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:03,186
Kill him!

627
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,992
This way, sir.

628
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:20,329
There is a shuttlebay
94 meters from our current position.

629
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,434
-There it is, sir.
-Go!

630
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:10,922
Data!

631
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:14,717
It appears to have
an encrypted security system.

632
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,552
Alacrity would be appreciated,
Commander!

633
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,264
Reman is a most complex language
with pictographs

634
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,891
representing certain verb roots...

635
00:59:21,974 --> 00:59:25,644
While I find that fascinating, Data,
we really need that door open!

636
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:08,728
According to the ship's manifest,
they're Scorpion-class attack fliers.

637
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,751
-Data, what do you imagine this is?
-Port thruster, sir.

638
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,211
Would you like me to drive, sir?

639
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,351
Data,
can you open the shuttlebay doors?

640
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,688
Negative, sir.
They've erected a force field

641
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:52,023
around the external portholes.

642
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:55,233
Well, then, only one way to go.

643
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,371
Do you think
this is a wise course of action, sir?

644
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:09,706
We're about to find out, Data.

645
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,460
Power up the disruptors.

646
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,920
-Ready, Captain.
-Fire.

647
01:01:54,126 --> 01:01:55,795
Tractor beam, now!

648
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,840
Worf, lock on transporters.

649
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,434
I have them, sir.

650
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,237
This has gone far enough.

651
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:25,865
I thought we'd discussed patience,
Commander.

652
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,451
Mine is wearing thin.

653
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,538
We supported you
because you promised action.

654
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,331
And yet, you delay.

655
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,503
The Enterprise is immaterial.

656
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:40,672
It won't even make it out
of the Neutral Zone.

657
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,384
And in two days

658
01:02:43,467 --> 01:02:47,679
the Federation will be crippled
beyond repair.

659
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,849
Does that satisfy you?

660
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,851
For the moment.

661
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,311
And when I return,

662
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:57,648
you and I shall have a little talk

663
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:00,568
about showing proper respect.

664
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,534
What's happening to his face?

665
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,126
Commander, a moment.

666
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:24,800
Are you truly prepared
to have your hands drenched in blood?

667
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,385
He's not planning to defeat Earth.

668
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,972
He's planning its annihilation.

669
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,936
And his sins will mark us
and our children for generations.

670
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,112
The more I studied his DNA,
the more confusing it got.

671
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,655
Finally,
I could come to only one conclusion.

672
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,867
Shinzon was created
with temporal RNA sequencing.

673
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,036
He was designed
so that at a certain point

674
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,498
his aging process could be accelerated

675
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,123
to reach your age more quickly.

676
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,126
He was engineered
to skip 30 years of his life.

677
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,172
But when the temporal sequencing
wasn't activated,

678
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:06,175
his cellular structure
started breaking down.

679
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,675
He's dying.

680
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,802
Dying?

681
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,182
Can anything be done for him?

682
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:16,101
Nothing, except a complete transfusion

683
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,938
from the only donor
with compatible DNA.

684
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,106
You.

685
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:30,449
-How long does he have?
-I can't say for sure.

686
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,744
But the rate of decay
seems to be accelerating.

687
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:39,625
Then he'll come for me.

688
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,320
Brother,

689
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:11,739
-I cannot move.
-No.

690
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:16,411
I have only activated your cognitive
and communication subroutines.

691
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,121
Why?

692
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:22,001
-Because you are dangerous.
-Why?

693
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,253
You have been
programmed to gather information

694
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:26,838
that can be used against this ship.

695
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,842
I do not understand.

696
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,554
I know.

697
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:41,894
Do you know anything about
Shinzon's plans against the Federation?

698
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,523
No.

699
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,612
Do you have any knowledge
of the tactical abilities of his ship?

700
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,155
No.

701
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,365
Can I move now?

702
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:56,702
No.

703
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,916
What are you doing?

704
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:07,045
-I must deactivate you.
-For how long?

705
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,132
Indefinitely.

706
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,719
How long is...

707
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,438
A long time, brother.

708
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,068
It's called a cascading biogenic pulse.

709
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,487
The unique properties
of thalaron radiation

710
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,489
allow the energy beam
to expand almost without limit.

711
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:38,744
Depending on its radiant intensity,
it could encompass a ship

712
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,746
or a planet.

713
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:46,793
He would only have built a weapon
of such scope

714
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,295
for one reason.

715
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,675
-He's going after Earth.
-How can you be certain?

716
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,054
I know how he thinks.

717
01:06:57,137 --> 01:07:00,391
Destroy humanity,
you cripple the Federation.

718
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:05,228
-The Romulans invade.
-No way of penetrating his cloak?

719
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,355
No.

720
01:07:08,148 --> 01:07:11,150
So he could pass within 10 meters
of every ship in Starfleet

721
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,112
and they'd never know.

722
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,699
We do have one advantage, though.

723
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,327
He needs your blood to live.

724
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,789
-He might come after you first.
-I'm counting on it.

725
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:27,041
We've been ordered to Sector 10-45.

726
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,420
Our fleet has been diverted
to meet us there.

727
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:33,132
-Strength in numbers.
-Yes, at least that's what we hope.

728
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:36,760
He must not be allowed
to use that weapon.

729
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:40,431
All other concerns are secondary.

730
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,186
You understand me?

731
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,860
Yes, sir.

732
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:00,324
All hands, battle stations.

733
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,591
Initiate the force field.

734
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,572
Captain's Personal Log, supplemental.

735
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:41,533
We're heading toward Federation space
at maximum warp.

736
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:42,993
The crew has responded

737
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,746
with the dedication
I've come to expect of them.

738
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:49,875
Like a thousand other commanders
on a thousand other battlefields,

739
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,752
I wait for the dawn.

740
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:15,442
How long?

741
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:20,238
A matter of hours.

742
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,368
We must begin the procedure now.

743
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,585
How long until we reach the Rift?

744
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,963
Seven minutes.

745
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,444
Data, what's our current position?

746
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:07,243
How soon until we reach the fleet?

747
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,287
At our current velocity,

748
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:13,500
we will arrive at Sector 10-45
in approximately 40 minutes, sir.

749
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,345
"For now we see but
through a glass, darkly."

750
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,474
-Sir?
-He said he is a mirror.

751
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,060
-Of you, sir?
-Yes.

752
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,064
I do not agree.

753
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,027
Although you share
the same genetic structure,

754
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:43,613
the events of your life
have created a unique individual.

755
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,865
If I had lived his life,

756
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:49,243
is it possible that
I would have rejected my humanity?

757
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,829
The B-4 is physically identical to me

758
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,750
although his neural pathways
are not as advanced.

759
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:58,002
But even if they were,
he would not be me.

760
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:02,716
-How can you be sure?
-I aspire, sir, to be better than I am.

761
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,679
B-4 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

762
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:12,975
We are passing through
the Bassen Rift, sir.

763
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,520
The projection will return
when we have cleared it.

764
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,774
It's interfering with our uplink
from Starfleet cartography?

765
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:22,152
The Rift affects all long-range...

766
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,363
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers.

767
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,288
Target weapons systems and shields.

768
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,667
I don't want the Enterprise destroyed.

769
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:06,404
Can you learn to see in the dark,
Captain?

770
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:08,657
Report.

771
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,618
He's firing from the cloak.
We can't get a lock.

772
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,619
He disabled our warp drive
with his first shot.

773
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,497
We only have impulse, Captain.

774
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:18,041
Mr. Worf, prepare
a full phaser spread, zero elevation.

775
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:19,667
All banks on my mark.

776
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,337
Scan for shield impacts.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

777
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,713
Aye, sir.

778
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,673
Fire!

779
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,645
You're too slow, old man.

780
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,774
Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

781
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,333
We are losing dorsal shields.

782
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,545
Full axis rotation to port!

783
01:13:03,628 --> 01:13:05,546
Fire all ventral phasers.

784
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,770
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

785
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:23,398
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
Get the shields online, Geordi.

786
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,024
Already on it.

787
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,403
Counselor Troi, report to the Bridge.

788
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,782
Captain, we are being hailed.

789
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,824
On-screen.

790
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,662
Captain Picard,

791
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,501
will you join me in your Ready Room?

792
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,645
You can't trace
my holographic emitters, Captain,

793
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:06,733
so don't bother.
And you can't contact Starfleet.

794
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:09,485
It's just the two of us now, Jean-Luc.

795
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,570
As it should be.

796
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:16,118
-Why are you here?
-To accept your surrender.

797
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,871
I can clearly destroy you at any time.

798
01:14:20,997 --> 01:14:24,751
Lower your shields and allow me
to transport you to my ship.

799
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,002
And the Enterprise?

800
01:14:28,713 --> 01:14:32,216
I have little interest
in your quaint vessel, Captain.

801
01:14:33,176 --> 01:14:34,970
Look at me, Shinzon.

802
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:41,434
Your heart, your hands,

803
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:44,354
your eyes are the same as mine.

804
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:49,150
The blood pumping within you,
the raw material is the same.

805
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:51,069
We have the same potential.

806
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:55,157
-That's the past, Captain.
-It can be the future.

807
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,783
Buried deep within you,

808
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,994
beneath all the years of pain and anger,

809
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,581
there is something
that has never been nurtured,

810
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:06,667
the potential
to make yourself a better man

811
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,462
and that is what it is to be human.

812
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:12,090
To make yourself more than you are.

813
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,344
Oh, yes.

814
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:19,264
I know you.

815
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:24,519
There was a time
you looked at the stars

816
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,813
and dreamed of what might be.

817
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,817
Childish dreams, Captain.

818
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:34,404
Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus.

819
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,615
I am what you see now.

820
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,743
I see more than that.
I see what you could be.

821
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:44,163
The man who is Shinzon of Remus
and Jean-Luc Picard

822
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:47,626
could never exterminate
the population of an entire planet.

823
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,627
He's better than that.

824
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,922
He is what his life has made him.

825
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:57,176
And what will you do with that life?
Waste it in a blaze of hatred?

826
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,970
There is a better way.

827
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,097
It's too late.

828
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:05,894
Never. You still have a choice.
Make the right one now.

829
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:10,481
-I can't fight what I am.
-Yes, you can.

830
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,820
I'll show you my true nature.

831
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,365
Our nature.

832
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:21,993
And as Earth dies, remember:

833
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:26,997
I will always,
forever be Shinzon of Remus.

834
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,086
And my voice shall echo through time
long after

835
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:35,006
yours has faded to a dim memory.

836
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,405
Two ships de-cloaking, sir. Romulan.

837
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:13,127
Captain.

838
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:21,386
Just when I thought
this couldn't get any worse.

839
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,346
We are being hailed.

840
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,225
On-screen.

841
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:33,480
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
of the warbird Valdore.

842
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,608
Might we be of assistance?

843
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,154
Assistance?

844
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,823
The Empire considers this
a matter of internal security.

845
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:45,827
We regret you've become involved.

846
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,416
Commander, when this is over,
I owe you a drink.

847
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,545
Romulan ale, Captain. Let's get to work.

848
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,421
You heard the lady.

849
01:17:57,922 --> 01:17:59,256
Let's go to work.

850
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:16,399
Mr. Worf, coordinate our attack
with the Valdore Tactical Officer.

851
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:18,693
Triangulate all fire
on any shield impacts.

852
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:19,860
Aye, sir.

853
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:31,413
Aft shields down to 40%.

854
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:34,708
Keep our bow on the Scimitar.
Auxiliary power to forward shields.

855
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,127
Aye, sir.

856
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:49,306
Target the flanking warbird.
All forward disruptor banks on my mark.

857
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:12,788
-Forward shields down to 10%.
-Bring us about.

858
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:26,761
Drop cloak on the aft port quadrant.
Prepare for full emergency stop.

859
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:29,012
-What?
-You heard me!

860
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:43,069
He's losing his cloak.
Stand by all forward disruptor banks.

861
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:47,907
She's almost on us.

862
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,618
Not yet.

863
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:58,376
-Praetor.
-Full stop. Fire!

864
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,900
Restore the aft cloak
and bring us about.

865
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:29,114
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait,
Captain.

866
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,409
-You have life support?
-For the moment.

867
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,079
-But we're dead in the water.
-Understood.

868
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,591
We're losing structural integrity

869
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,720
on Decks 12 through 17,
sections 4 through 10.

870
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,016
Emergency Force fields are holding.

871
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,770
Evacuate those decks.
Re-route field power to forward shields.

872
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:05,234
Captain,

873
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,612
I think I may have a way to find them.

874
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:14,911
Prepare for a lateral run,
all starboard disruptors.

875
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:23,795
What is it?

876
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,296
What is it?

877
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,801
She's here.

878
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,583
He's resisting me.

879
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:17,015
No!

880
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:22,353
Remember me?

881
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:26,231
Now.

882
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:37,952
Fire at will.

883
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,884
Prepare a boarding party.
Bring me Picard.

884
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,386
You.

885
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:00,766
Get the cloak back!

886
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:04,979
Target all shield coordinates, Beta-3.
All disruptors fire!

887
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:17,324
Captain,
we've lost ventral shielding on Deck 29!

888
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:19,827
Divert all power and compensate.

889
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,167
-Intruder alert.
-Number One.

890
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:30,712
-Let's go.
-Security detail to Deck 29.

891
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:52,609
The Romulans fought with honor.

892
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,279
Yes, they did, Mr. Worf.

893
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:38,197
Worf, cover me.

894
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:12,082
Medical teams to the Bridge.

895
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:29,057
Report.

896
01:26:29,141 --> 01:26:31,769
We have exhausted
our complement of photon torpedoes.

897
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,688
Phaser banks are down to 4%, sir.

898
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:37,190
What if we targeted all our phasers
in a concentrated pattern?

899
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:41,863
The Scimitar shields are still at 70%.
It would make no difference, Captain.

900
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,998
What's he doing?

901
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:07,095
He wants to look me in the eye.

902
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,144
We've got him.

903
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,192
He thinks he knows exactly
what I'm going to do.

904
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:23,904
Geordi, divert all power to the engines.
Take it from life support, if you have to.

905
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,157
Give me everything you've got.

906
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,328
Ready, Captain.

907
01:27:32,204 --> 01:27:34,247
We are being hailed, sir.

908
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:37,542
Deanna, stand by. Open a channel.

909
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:44,382
-I hope you're still alive, Jean-Luc.
-Yes, I am.

910
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:47,177
Don't you think it's time to surrender?

911
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,680
Why should the rest of your crew
have to die?

912
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,975
Shinzon, I don't think I ever told you

913
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,185
about my first Academy evaluation.

914
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:59,189
In particular,
I was thought to be extremely

915
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:01,734
overconfident.

916
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:06,029
Captain, as much as I enjoy
listening to you talk, I really think...

917
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:12,536
On my mark, Deanna.
All hands, brace for impact.

918
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:16,207
Engage.

919
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,019
Hard to port!

920
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:10,904
Divert all power to the engines.

921
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:14,240
Full reverse.

922
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,753
Reconfiguring now.

923
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:57,136
Computer, stand by
auto-destruct sequence Omega.

924
01:31:57,761 --> 01:32:00,014
Recognize voice pattern
Jean-Luc Picard.

925
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:03,184
Authorization Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5.

926
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:07,770
Auto-destruct is offline.

927
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:31,628
Disruptors are not functional, sir.

928
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:36,841
Deploy the weapon.

929
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:41,805
Kill everything on that ship,

930
01:32:42,806 --> 01:32:44,975
then set a course for Earth.

931
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:47,853
We must complete our mission.

932
01:33:04,703 --> 01:33:06,247
Matrix initiated.

933
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:11,710
Sequencing procedure
for thalaron radiation transfer

934
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:13,127
activated.

935
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,930
Some ideals are worth dying for,
aren't they, Jean-Luc?

936
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:40,113
Thalaron intermix procedure initiated.

937
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:44,868
Deployment of targeting arms
commencing.

938
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:10,060
How long until he can fire?

939
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:17,650
The targeting sequence should
take about seven minutes, Captain.

940
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:20,112
When the targeting arms
are fully deployed,

941
01:34:20,195 --> 01:34:23,198
the matrix on the Bridge
will relay the thalaron radiation

942
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:25,743
to the firing points at their tips.

943
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,494
No one on the Enterprise will survive.

944
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:37,755
-How can he? He'll kill you.
-It's not about me anymore.

945
01:34:41,091 --> 01:34:44,552
-Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
-I don't think that the transport...

946
01:34:44,636 --> 01:34:46,971
-That's an order, Commander.
-Sir, allow me to go.

947
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:49,350
-Data, this is something I have to do.
-Sir.

948
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,685
-Data.
-You have the Bridge, Commander.

949
01:34:51,935 --> 01:34:54,938
Try and put some distance
between you and the Scimitar.

950
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:58,274
-Now, Mr. La Forge.
-Aye, sir.

951
01:35:07,534 --> 01:35:11,079
That's it. Transporters are down.

952
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:18,753
System is fused.

953
01:35:18,837 --> 01:35:22,382
Counselor Troi, please assume
command. Geordi, come with me.

954
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:22,067
Thalaron intermix level: 30%.

955
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,012
Four minutes to firing sequence.

956
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:35,097
Thalaron intermix level: 50%.

957
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,363
Three minutes to firing sequence.

958
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:14,762
Thalaron intermix level: 60%.

959
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:15,364
Two minutes to firing sequence.

960
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:42,391
Thalaron intermix level: 80%.

961
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,462
I'm glad we're together now.

962
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:14,757
Our destiny is complete.

963
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:28,270
One minute to firing sequence.

964
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:34,528
Thalaron intermix level completed.

965
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:53,587
30 seconds to firing sequence.

966
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:08,310
Goodbye.

967
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:11,814
Ten, nine, eight,

968
01:41:12,315 --> 01:41:15,609
seven, six, five,

969
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:19,448
four, three, two...

970
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:46,515
Data?

971
01:42:17,547 --> 01:42:18,840
Captain.

972
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:26,640
It's Data.

973
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:49,162
Captain, we're being hailed.

974
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:51,622
On-screen.

975
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,086
Open a channel.

976
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,172
This is Commander Donatra
of the Valdore.

977
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:04,176
We're dispatching shuttles
with medical personnel and supplies.

978
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:08,556
Thank you, Commander.

979
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:12,685
You've earned a friend
in the Romulan Empire today, Captain.

980
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,145
I hope, the first of many.

981
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,065
Valdore out.

982
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:27,492
Geordi,
prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals.

983
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:33,163
They don't know our procedures.

984
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:38,712
-Just open the doors.
-I'll take care of it, Captain.

985
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:41,422
You have the Bridge, Number One.

986
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,317
Thank you.

987
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:14,456
To absent friends.

988
01:44:19,377 --> 01:44:20,753
To family.

989
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:42,775
First time I saw Data,

990
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:45,862
he was leaning against a tree
in the holodeck,

991
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:49,990
trying to whistle.
Funniest thing I ever saw.

992
01:44:50,993 --> 01:44:54,453
No matter what he did,
he couldn't get the tune right.

993
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:58,123
What was that song?

994
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:03,546
Can't remember the song.

995
01:45:33,868 --> 01:45:34,953
Come.

996
01:45:37,372 --> 01:45:39,916
-Will.
-Permission to disembark, sir.

997
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,085
Granted.

998
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:46,588
So, where's the Titan off to?

999
01:45:46,756 --> 01:45:48,425
The Neutral Zone.

1000
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:50,592
We're heading up the new task force.

1001
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:53,555
Apparently,
the Romulans are interested in talking.

1002
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:56,807
I can't think of a better man for the job.

1003
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:01,520
If I may, just a word of advice
about your first command?

1004
01:46:01,604 --> 01:46:03,105
Anything.

1005
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:08,069
When your First Officer insists
that you can't go on away missions...

1006
01:46:08,154 --> 01:46:11,573
Ignore him. I intend to.

1007
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:20,622
Serving with you has been an honor.

1008
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:26,296
The honor was mine, Captain.

1009
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,064
I don't know
if all this has made any sense.

1010
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:48,150
But I wanted you to know
what kind of man he was.

1011
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:51,820
In his quest to be more like us,

1012
01:46:52,363 --> 01:46:55,492
he helped us to see
what it means to be human.

1013
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,328
My...

1014
01:47:00,413 --> 01:47:02,664
My brother was not human.

1015
01:47:05,168 --> 01:47:06,920
No, he wasn't.

1016
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:09,671
But his wonder,

1017
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:13,717
his curiosity about
every facet of human nature

1018
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:17,387
allowed all of us to see
the best parts of ourselves.

1019
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:18,847
He evolved.

1020
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:22,476
He embraced change

1021
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,814
because he always wanted
to be better than he was.

1022
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:30,275
I...

1023
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:34,363
I do not understand.

1024
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:41,746
Well, I hope someday you will.

1025
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:47,543
Captain, the warp engines
are ready to go online.

1026
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:52,047
I'm on my way.
Please inform Commander La Forge.

1027
01:47:56,386 --> 01:47:58,054
We'll talk later.

1028
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:02,225
Never saw the sun

1029
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:07,729
Never saw the sun

1030
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:13,403
Never saw the sun

1031
01:48:15,864 --> 01:48:17,739
Shining so bright

1032
01:48:18,449 --> 01:48:20,409
Shining so bright

1033
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:24,747
Never saw things

1034
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:31,087
"Going so right."

1035
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,797
Going so right
