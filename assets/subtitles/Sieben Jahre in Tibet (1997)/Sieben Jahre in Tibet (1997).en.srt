1
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,135
Why must you be this way?

2
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,100
Why must you be this way?

3
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,371
Why is there always a problem?
It's a good question.

4
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,213
Do you want to go home?
Do you want to turn around?

5
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,614
- Yes!
- It's the Himalayas!

6
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,381
How long have I been talking
about the Himalayas?

7
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,718
- How long?
- Far too long.

8
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:48,691
Horst, when we get there,
can you give me a hand, please?

9
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,854
- Yes, of course.
- Ingrid, stop it.

10
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,651
Let's try to make the best of this.

11
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,314
Where's this idiot
who's supposed to meet us?

12
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,418
Move!

13
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,928
Mr. Harrer.

14
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,661
I have your tickets.

15
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,603
- I'm late. Take me to my train.
- No, you don't understand.

16
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,072
I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition.

17
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,235
- How do you do?
- Here's our celebrity!

18
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,245
Mr. Harrer?

19
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:44,271
May I say, Mr. Harrer,
on behalf of the <i>Reichssportsfuhrer...</i>

20
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,547
we are honored to have
such a great German hero on the team.

21
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,088
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.

22
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,521
Yes, but I'm sure that
as a distinguished member...

23
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:55,617
of the National Socialist Party,
you would be proud to plant...

24
00:04:55,694 --> 00:05:00,689
our country's flag on the summit
of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.

25
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,735
Hans Lobenhoffer.

26
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,394
Lutz Chicken.

27
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,935
And a picture with your lovely wife.

28
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,747
And Mr...

29
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:18,750
Horst Immendorf. Family friend.
No picture necessary.

30
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,088
When is the little one due,
Mrs. Harrer?

31
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,648
About the time my husband
reaches the base camp.

32
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,593
Thank you.

33
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,290
Why don't you tell the entire
stinking country our troubles?

34
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,468
I'm getting on that train.
Do you have anything you want to say?

35
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,564
Fine.

36
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,709
Go. Leave.

37
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,103
I'll see you in four months.

38
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,350
- Take good care of her, Horst.
- I will, Heinrich.

39
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,363
<i>We will travel 5,000 miles.</i>

40
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,031
<i>When we reach India,</i>
<i>we will head for the Himalayas...</i>

41
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:24,042
<i>and the ninth highest peak</i>
<i>on Earth, Nanga Parbat.</i>

42
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,601
<i>Germany calls it</i> "Unserberg...
<i>Our Mountain. "</i>

43
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,815
<i>Before us, four German expeditions</i>
<i>attempted it.</i>

44
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,442
<i>All failed.</i>

45
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,182
<i>Eleven climbers were killed</i>
<i>in storms and avalanches.</i>

46
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:41,817
<i>By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat</i>
<i>is a national obsession...</i>

47
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,259
<i>a matter of German pride.</i>

48
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,194
<i>July 29, 1939.</i>

49
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,105
<i>We have already made Camp Four</i>
<i>at 22,000 feet.</i>

50
00:07:56,175 --> 00:08:01,168
<i>Overhead is the Rekiak Glacier</i>
<i>and a difficult climb up the icefall.</i>

51
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,877
<i>The baby must be</i>
<i>at least one month old now.</i>

52
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,819
<i>I have been</i>
<i>so confused and distracted.</i>

53
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,689
<i>I can't climb</i>
<i>with my usual confidence.</i>

54
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,480
Are you all right?

55
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,419
Shit!

56
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,860
- Are you all right?
- Shall we come down?

57
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,966
Lost a crampon!

58
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:01,768
Go ahead!

59
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,092
The weather's getting bad.
We should rope up.

60
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:34,139
- Did you hurt yourself back there?
- Just a scratch. I'll lead.

61
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,600
Rocks!

62
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,003
Look out below!

63
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,716
Hold me!

64
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,197
Have you got me?

65
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,174
Hold me!

66
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:48,370
You should have told me
how bad that wound was.

67
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,110
I should take a look at it.
I could sew it up.

68
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,845
It's not your problem.

69
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,788
Actually, it is my problem.

70
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:06,984
- It's my life.
- What?

71
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:10,687
When you conceal a serious injury
and put my life at risk...

72
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,730
I consider that my problem.

73
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,892
No, you put your life at risk.
I saved it, so shut up!

74
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,163
Please, it is not your place...

75
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,828
Shut up!

76
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:24,303
The next time you lie
about an injury, Heinrich...

77
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,211
you're off the team.

78
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,346
Try it.

79
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,596
<i>August 4th, Camp Five.</i>
<i>Some fierce storms have passed.</i>

80
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,661
<i>My teammates are nervous</i>
<i>about the avalanches...</i>

81
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,206
<i>so we've been holed up for days.</i>

82
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,505
<i>Aufschnaiter should take advantage of</i>
<i>this lowland weather to make high camp.</i>

83
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:10,241
<i>But he disagrees with me. Fool.</i>

84
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,285
<i>It seems the others don't mind</i>
<i>sitting here waiting...</i>

85
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,118
<i>hoping, doing nothing.</i>

86
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,923
<i>So much time to question</i>
<i>one's self is not good.</i>

87
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:28,489
<i>I am beginning to think</i>
<i>this whole expedition was a mistake.</i>

88
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,019
Run! Avalanche! Get out!

89
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,320
Leave everything!

90
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,043
Put that down!

91
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,008
We are going down now!

92
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,947
If they're frightened of a storm,
send them down to Camp Two.

93
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,350
I could summit on my own!
Always give the best man his shot!

94
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,911
He's trying to tell us
he's the best man.

95
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,219
Give me two Sherpas.
I can make Camp Six by tonight...

96
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,225
and my final attack tomorrow!

97
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:31,263
- We are going down now as a team!
- I've earned that peak!

98
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,264
- I want that peak!
- As a team! That's an order!

99
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:36,893
That is an order! An order!

100
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:39,695
Follow me!

101
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,062
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.

102
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:48,004
Take it, <i>Si Hib.</i>
It will protect you.

103
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:51,440
No, that means nothing to me.

104
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,138
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.

105
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,975
<i>Si Hib,</i> take it.

106
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,981
Good protection for you.

107
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,997
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.

108
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,297
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.

109
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,527
Well, let's hope that Germany
retreats from Poland...

110
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,797
as quickly as you did
from your mountain.

111
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,338
It might save you some prison time.

112
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:25,041
What is this? Who are you?

113
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,137
- I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
- What charge? Failure to summit?

114
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,682
I'm afraid not.

115
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:37,015
You see, war has been declared between
His Majesty's Government and Germany.

116
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:42,152
So all enemy aliens on British Empire
soil are now prisoners of war.

117
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,873
- Stop, or I'll shoot!
- Hands up!

118
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,603
No, you don't understand!
I'm Austrian! I'm a climber!

119
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:34,907
I have nothing to do
with your silly war!

120
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,012
I can walk myself.
This is an insult!

121
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:48,884
You think you have the last word,
but you don't!

122
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,724
Pigs! All of you, pigs!

123
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,144
<i>October 15, 1939.</i>

124
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:12,816
<i>Reaching prison camp,</i>
<i>I make a promise to myself.</i>

125
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:18,917
<i>I will be lying beside Ingrid before</i>
<i>the summer solstice of the new year.</i>

126
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,351
<i>The Himalayas are right in front of us.</i>

127
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,396
<i>It will be easy to escape</i>
<i>and get lost in them.</i>

128
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,838
<i>My fourth escape attempt</i>
<i>brings me no closer to my goal.</i>

129
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:46,281
How far did you get this time?

130
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,287
<i>All I have achieved is a certain</i>
<i>dubious celebrity among the prisoners.</i>

131
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,945
<i>If only my hand could express</i>
<i>what is in my heart.</i>

132
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:35,729
I hear the guards
are mailing letters for you.

133
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:38,128
Yes.

134
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:40,671
Would you mail these?

135
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,642
Thank you.

136
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,076
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?

137
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,511
It was checked out to you.

138
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,722
- We need to talk to you.
- What about?

139
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:00,257
About this.

140
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,667
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?

141
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,761
After monsoon season. And you?

142
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,670
I see you've chosen
my route through Tibet.

143
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,681
The few foreigners who have tried
never came back. So, good luck.

144
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,013
- Would you like to come with us?
- Why?

145
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,248
After all, you are the authority
on jailbreak around here.

146
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:33,883
- We could benefit from your experience.
- Please.

147
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,790
Stop this embarrassing charade.

148
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:43,097
Every time you escape,
the patrols are doubled and tripled.

149
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,432
It is making life very difficult
for the rest of us.

150
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,565
I prefer to travel on my own,
but thanks for thinking of me.

151
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,183
The mailman has come.

152
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,582
<i>Dear Heinrich:</i>

153
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,355
<i>Please sign the enclosed divorce papers</i>
<i>and send them to my lawyer.</i>

154
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,490
<i>Horst and I intend to be married</i>
<i>as soon as the divorce is finalized.</i>

155
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,500
<i>As for your letter, yes.</i>

156
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:54,528
<i>Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born</i>
<i>while you were climbing the mountain.</i>

157
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:58,541
<i>He is now two years old</i>
<i>and calls Horst "papa."</i>

158
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,805
<i>When he is old enough,</i>
<i>I will tell him...</i>

159
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,507
<i>his real father was lost</i>
<i>in the Himalayas.</i>

160
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,641
<i>It seems the kindest thing</i>
<i>to say considering...</i>

161
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,184
<i>you never wanted the child anyway.</i>

162
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:10,813
<i>Needless to say,</i>
<i>I have no intention...</i>

163
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:14,619
<i>of "resolving our differences"</i>
<i>as you suggested.</i>

164
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:18,151
<i>They were resolved</i>
<i>the moment you left Austria.</i>

165
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,393
<i>I'm sorry you have been</i>
<i>imprisoned in India...</i>

166
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:25,663
<i>and hope this dreadful war will soon</i>
<i>be over for everyone's sake.</i>

167
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,328
<i>Ingrid.</i>

168
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,790
I'm coming with you.

169
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:07,037
This is your plan?

170
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,203
In my humble opinion,
this is ridiculous.

171
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:17,145
Then since you are so humble,
we won't ask your opinion.

172
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,990
Open the charts. Turn around.

173
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,964
Keep your back to the gate.
Open the charts!

174
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:27,479
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.

175
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,612
We are clear. Okay.

176
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,661
Open the gates!

177
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,905
See to this. Open the gates!

178
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,050
I'm going off on my own.

179
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:36,177
So, good luck.

180
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:17,660
<i>First escape from prison camp,</i>
<i>November 18, 1939.</i>

181
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,856
<i>Rolf Harrer...</i>
<i>three and a half months old.</i>

182
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:27,229
<i>My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.</i>

183
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:32,140
<i>Rolf Harrer... exactly one year,</i>
<i>11 months and 26 days.</i>

184
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:37,980
<i>Last escape from Dehra Dun.</i>
<i>Rolf Harrer...</i>

185
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,462
Take two and sleep it off.
I'll send you a bill in the morning.

186
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,472
What are you doing here?

187
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,705
I missed you so much.
I thought I'd pay you a visit.

188
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,116
What about the others?

189
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,814
The Italians were caught
outside Nelang.

190
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,949
Lutz and Hans got sick
and had to turn back.

191
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:38,986
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure you're heartbroken.

192
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,592
May I impose upon your generous nature
and camp here tonight?

193
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,604
Be my guest.

194
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,868
Thank you.
It is very gracious of you.

195
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:13,262
- Good.
- What else do you have in there?

196
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,560
A ten-piece orchestra?

197
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:20,036
By the way, I heard
the Japanese have retreated...

198
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,131
all the way back to Shanghai so even
if you make it to the Chinese border...

199
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,199
you may have difficulty
catching up with them.

200
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,904
I don't care if they're repelled
all the way back to Tokyo.

201
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,971
You should if you want
to get back to Austria.

202
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,111
- But I don't.
- Don't what?

203
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,116
- Plan to go back.
- Why not?

204
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,295
No particular reason.

205
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,160
When you get there, tell my wife...

206
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,258
that two years in prison camp is roughly
equivalent to four years of marriage.

207
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,895
And I'm glad to be free of them both.

208
00:32:56,907 --> 00:33:01,140
I'm not going back either,
not until this shameful war is over.

209
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:03,942
- And where are you headed?
- Tibet.

210
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:08,611
Then on to China,
see if I can find some work there.

211
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,152
And you?

212
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:15,682
By my calculations, the Chinese border
is 2,058 kilometers away.

213
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,354
Tibet is 68.

214
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,593
It's a long way to travel
with such a heavy load.

215
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,067
No, just full of food.

216
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:28,934
- Precisely.
- Mine.

217
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,266
That's too bad.

218
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:36,176
Those mountains are treacherous.
There are glaciers to be crossed.

219
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,442
If you had roped up to me,
I could have kept you alive.

220
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,847
Considering your performance
the last time we roped up...

221
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:43,113
I think I'm safer without you.

222
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:48,686
Of course.

223
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:57,364
But I think you are wrong about
that Tibetan border calculation.

224
00:33:57,434 --> 00:34:00,632
By my measurements,
it is 65 kilometers.

225
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,808
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?

226
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,648
All you've got is some stale crackers.

227
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,813
But I'm right. I'll win.

228
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,228
<i>Tibet, the roof of the world.</i>

229
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:04,427
<i>It feels as though we have</i>
<i>ascended a medieval stone fortress...</i>

230
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:07,335
<i>towering above the center of Asia.</i>

231
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,896
<i>This is the highest country on Earth.</i>

232
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,907
<i>And the most isolated.</i>

233
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,442
There it is.

234
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,387
Tibet.

235
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:30,219
- Exactly 68 kilometers.
- Congratulations.

236
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,893
Unfortunately, you've eaten
all your winnings.

237
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,244
Yes.

238
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,286
Just smile and say yes.
It's better that way.

239
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,085
It's amazing what you learn
in prison, isn't it?

240
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,527
Tibet.

241
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,833
- No foreigners allowed in Tibet.
- Oh, please!

242
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,434
No foreigner!

243
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,501
Oh, please!

244
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:32,817
Yes. Thank you. Of course.

245
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,351
No translation needed.

246
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,215
Some people are glad to see us.

247
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:38,585
Don't let it get to your head.

248
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:42,786
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means
they are driving out evil forces.

249
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,867
We need to find food.

250
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:08,911
It is the prophecy. It says here...

251
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:13,184
in the final testament
of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.

252
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:17,023
"It may happen that, in Tibet,
religions and government...

253
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,858
will be attacked by outside forces.

254
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:23,228
Unless we can guard our own country...

255
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,532
monks and their monasteries
will be destroyed.

256
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:30,369
The lands and property
of government officials will be seized.

257
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,275
The Dalai Lama and all
the revered holders of the faith...

258
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,869
will disappear and become nameless."

259
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:40,643
Now you understand why we are not
welcome to foreigners here?

260
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:44,813
Yes, but you must understand
we're not here to threaten or harm.

261
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,119
We just need food,
and then we'll be on our...

262
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,215
His Excellency, the Garpon.

263
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:59,262
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.

264
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,237
We wanted to apologize.

265
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,898
Apologize.

266
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:09,902
And give you this really special gift.

267
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,675
Please, from us.

268
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:18,016
Long live the Dalai Lama,
His Holiness.

269
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,922
Thank you for the picture.
Go back to India!

270
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:38,807
<i>Two days into Tibet's western frontier</i>
<i>and we are graciously kicked out.</i>

271
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:42,139
<i>Our guides have strict orders</i>
<i>to escort us...</i>

272
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,376
<i>to the Indian border</i>
<i>some 40 kilometers away...</i>

273
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,282
<i>and to shoot us</i>
<i>if we attempt escape.</i>

274
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,144
Must mean hello.

275
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,485
As long as they don't try to kiss me.

276
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,253
We have to stock up. I'm broke.

277
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:36,632
Don't look at me.

278
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:40,067
We have to eat, Peter.
Know what time it is?

279
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,804
It is not negotiable.

280
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:46,364
My father gave it to me
when I climbed Mount Blanc.

281
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,570
Everyone's climbed Mount Blanc.

282
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,840
If I had a watch like this,
I would trade it.

283
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:36,992
- Where did you get this jacket?
- North Tibet.

284
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,585
Communism soldier come from China.
Very nice.

285
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,632
They give food, money. Very nice.
Communism soldier.

286
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:47,668
You like military uniforms, yes?

287
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,639
I have German army boots.
For you. Yes?

288
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,074
Wait.

289
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,313
Give me these, for the guards.

290
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,856
Look!

291
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,090
Like this. You like?

292
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,268
Very good. They're tough.

293
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:23,101
My friend, shall I show you
how German soldiers march?

294
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:30,543
You must make this face.

295
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,088
Come! Yes.

296
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,751
Stop!

297
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,856
Excellent. Yes.
You, with practice.

298
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:53,396
Now, I will show you
how German soldiers run.

299
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,809
Stand like this.

300
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,025
Guess what?

301
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,492
All clear.

302
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,048
Know what time it is?

303
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,960
You think I'm so happy
to be traveling with you...

304
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,590
I should foot the bill?

305
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,067
You are such a big man
you don't need to contribute?

306
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,829
You have a problem?

307
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,338
Remind me...

308
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,568
what you said at the bazaar back there.

309
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:45,980
"If I had a watch like that,
I would trade it."

310
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,150
You do not have one.

311
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,519
You cheap, lying bastard!
You have three!

312
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,070
This is junk
from some Italian prisoners.

313
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,539
I don't give a shit!

314
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,735
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?

315
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,302
What principle?

316
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,371
You want a watch?
Go ahead. Pick one.

317
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:21,940
- And keep your principles.
- Look at you!

318
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,547
Caught being a selfish brat
and you're gloating!

319
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,523
You're acting like an old woman.
What do you want?

320
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:32,960
Try apologizing.

321
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,088
Try feeling a little remorse.

322
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:38,657
And if all else fails,
try wiping that smirk off your face!

323
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,170
Take your stinking watch
and shut up!

324
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:46,704
I don't need another boring sermon from
some frustrated glorified tour guide.

325
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:58,751
No wonder you are always alone.

326
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,018
No one can stand
your miserable company.

327
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:36,423
Please, take them.

328
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,835
It was wrong of me to hide them.

329
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:01,447
- Keep this.
- No.

330
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:10,516
I didn't deserve it either.
Go ahead.

331
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:30,311
He'll be three and a half years old now.

332
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:38,085
Pretty soon, she'll tell him
I was lost in the Himalayas.

333
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,923
Which is fine.

334
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,454
Why?

335
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:52,659
Better a dead father
than a lousy father.

336
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:56,438
Write him a letter.

337
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,101
Let him know you're still alive.

338
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,215
New York.

339
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,351
Venice.

340
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,262
- Paris.
- Your Holiness, where are you?

341
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:28,429
It is time for your lesson.

342
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:38,713
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.

343
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,409
<i>Dear Rolf Harrer:</i>

344
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,751
<i>I'm a person you don't know...</i>

345
00:48:46,822 --> 00:48:49,621
<i>a man you've never met.</i>

346
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,422
<i>But you are someone</i>
<i>who occupies my mind...</i>

347
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,396
<i>and my heart...</i>

348
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:56,556
<i>in this distant land</i>
<i>where I have gone.</i>

349
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,661
<i>If you can imagine a hidden place</i>
<i>tucked safely away from the world...</i>

350
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:06,139
<i>concealed by walls</i>
<i>of high, snowcapped mountains...</i>

351
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:09,804
<i>a place rich with all the strange</i>
<i>beauty of your nighttime dreams...</i>

352
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,414
<i>then you know where I am.</i>

353
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,353
<i>In the country</i>
<i>where I am traveling, Tibet...</i>

354
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:22,623
<i>people believe if they walk</i>
<i>long distances to holy places...</i>

355
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,525
<i>it purifies the bad deeds</i>
<i>they've committed.</i>

356
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:28,119
<i>They believe</i>
<i>the more difficult the journey...</i>

357
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:30,826
<i>the greater the depth</i>
<i>of purification.</i>

358
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:38,003
<i>I've been walking from one faraway</i>
<i>place to the next for many years...</i>

359
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,336
<i>as long as you have lived.</i>

360
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:46,039
<i>I have seen seasons change</i>
<i>across the high plateaus.</i>

361
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:49,347
<i>I have seen wild kiangs</i>
<i>migrate south in winter...</i>

362
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:52,353
<i>and sweep back across the fields</i>
<i>when spring appears.</i>

363
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,815
<i>In this place,</i>
<i>where time stands still...</i>

364
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,827
<i>it seems that everything is moving...</i>

365
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:01,661
<i>including me.</i>

366
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,036
<i>I can't say I know where I'm going...</i>

367
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:10,130
<i>nor whether my bad deeds</i>
<i>can be purified.</i>

368
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,735
<i>There are so many things</i>
<i>I have done which I regret.</i>

369
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,646
<i>But when I come to a full stop,</i>
<i>I hope you will understand...</i>

370
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:23,344
<i>that the distance between us</i>
<i>is not as great as it seems.</i>

371
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,853
<i>With deep affection...</i>

372
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:30,414
<i>your father, Heinrich Harrer.</i>

373
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:32,987
Get up.

374
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:44,565
My God!

375
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:51,177
I'll give you these.

376
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,967
Yellow head!

377
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:16,972
- No! Wait! We have nothing!
- Give me money!

378
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:18,472
We have no money!

379
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,442
Give me watch!

380
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,034
- Give me clothes!
- We have nothing for you!

381
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,411
Wait!

382
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,052
Where are you headed?

383
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:45,356
I have permit.

384
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,739
Lhasa. I have permit.

385
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:49,284
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader
of Tibet to spy on people.

386
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:58,289
<i>Only a month ago, we were certain</i>
<i>of death at the hands of bandits.</i>

387
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:04,135
<i>And today, we have reached the gates</i>
<i>of the forbidden city of Lhasa.</i>

388
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:07,005
<i>It is as difficult a goal as Mecca...</i>

389
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:11,844
<i>and precisely as attractive</i>
<i>because it is closed to all foreigners.</i>

390
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,684
<i>Even in our miserable condition...</i>

391
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:18,744
<i>we feel the lure</i>
<i>of Tibet's holiest city...</i>

392
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,222
<i>home of the Dalai Lama.</i>

393
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:24,992
<i>Only a few foreigners</i>
<i>had penetrated its mysteries.</i>

394
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,222
Oh, my God!

395
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,965
- Is it over?
- No, it is not over.

396
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:32,286
You are invited to stay
for lunch, if you like.

397
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:35,081
We'd like that very much.

398
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,557
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.

399
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:42,028
I am Peter.

400
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,699
Lord Chamberlain, may I request...

401
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:52,434
an audience with the regent
and ministers of the cabinet?

402
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:56,878
It's about two foreigners
who came to Lhasa.

403
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,885
With respect, Rinpoche...

404
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:07,947
if your intention is to stop the Chinese
from recruiting political allies...

405
00:57:08,023 --> 00:57:13,427
then demanding that they stop
trying to bribe monks...

406
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,896
is not the most effective tactic.

407
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:22,467
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.

408
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,302
Of course. Forgive me.

409
00:57:29,378 --> 00:57:31,244
You may leave now.

410
00:57:31,313 --> 00:57:34,806
Start translating the letter
as written.

411
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,443
Of course.

412
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:58,036
Do you realize how many men
could survive such an ordeal?

413
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:01,010
We should respect them.

414
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:05,137
If we return them to India,
they'll surely go back to prison.

415
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:08,547
But they have no purpose here,
Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.

416
00:58:08,617 --> 00:58:12,452
I have invited them to stay
at my guest quarters...

417
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:16,856
assuming you would grant them permission
to remain in Lhasa, of course.

418
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:19,793
Invited them to stay at your place?

419
00:58:20,362 --> 00:58:21,853
But why?

420
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,956
Must one have reason
to help those in need?

421
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:29,594
Beast.

422
00:58:34,443 --> 00:58:36,378
I think she said you stink.

423
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,347
You do not need
to introduce yourselves.

424
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,351
I know who you are.

425
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,483
I am Pema Lhaki.

426
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,356
Ngawang wishes to make a gift to you,
so please take your clothes off.

427
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,724
Let's get started.
I don't have all day.

428
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:35,101
Well, this is most kind
of Ngawang Jigme.

429
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,639
Who is he to be so thoughtful?

430
00:59:37,706 --> 00:59:40,175
Secretary to the ministers
of the government.

431
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:42,905
He wished to make you
a gift of new clothes.

432
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:46,005
Please select your preferred
article of clothing.

433
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,277
You're a seamstress?

434
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:54,414
I am a tailor, sir,
the only tailor in Lhasa...

435
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:58,324
who has been to Calcutta and
can reproduce these silly costumes.

436
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,931
So, I pick?

437
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,467
Yes, choose whichever you like.

438
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,501
- And you can make any of these?
- Yes.

439
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,344
- Very good.
- Did you make this?

440
01:00:16,411 --> 01:00:19,643
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

441
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:21,411
- Thank you.
- Do you like this?

442
01:00:21,483 --> 01:00:23,418
Whichever you like.

443
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,184
I will have this handsome tweed jacket.

444
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:32,920
And this pair of sporting
woolen trousers, please.

445
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,362
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

446
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,364
And you, sir?

447
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:43,666
- Perhaps you could choose for me.
- Thank you.

448
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:51,302
Please, sir, take off your <i>chu-pa.</i>
I would like to measure.

449
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:05,887
Stand still, please.

450
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,032
This way, please.

451
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,505
- Stand still.
- Sorry.

452
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,179
- No moving, please.
- I'm sorry.

453
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,092
That way, you will never fall.
It's perfect.

454
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:45,827
Still, walking up mountains
is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.

455
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:48,268
Not so foolish, really.

456
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,331
Look at this.

457
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,371
Go ahead.

458
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,315
That's after I climbed
the Eiger North Face.

459
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:16,231
That's Olympics.
Gold medal. Not important.

460
01:02:16,298 --> 01:02:21,259
Then this is another great difference
between our civilization and yours.

461
01:02:21,336 --> 01:02:23,099
You admire the man...

462
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:27,335
who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life...

463
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:30,777
while we admire the man
who abandons his ego.

464
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:36,815
The average Tibetan wouldn't think
to thrust himself forward this way.

465
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:55,795
Gentlemen.

466
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:01,702
- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No, we have not.

467
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:04,338
I am Ngawang Jigme.

468
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:11,476
- Yes, of course.
- Forgive us.

469
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,250
Thank you for your generous gift.

470
01:03:14,322 --> 01:03:16,518
It's wonderful. Thank you.

471
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,356
You are most welcome.
I am sure we will meet again.

472
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,478
Perhaps you could help us explain...

473
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:40,641
why the ministers...

474
01:03:40,715 --> 01:03:44,516
demand that the Chinese government...

475
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:48,489
"...cease making generous
financial contributions...

476
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:52,722
to Tibetan monasteries."

477
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:57,128
Do our gifts displease your government?

478
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:01,398
I cannot speak for the regent
nor the ministers, Excellence.

479
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:03,802
I am only a mere secretary.

480
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:08,367
Not for long, I presume.
Sit down.

481
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:19,521
A man of such obvious talent
cannot be satisfied...

482
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:23,992
with just translating letters.

483
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:27,188
Your diplomatic skill...

484
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:30,061
would be richly rewarded here.

485
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:36,965
Serving my country faithfully
is reward enough, Excellence.

486
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:42,210
I ask permission to take my leave.

487
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,510
It looks like we're both in need
of a good tailor today.

488
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,976
Yes, there's a...

489
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,284
Please, take a seat.

490
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,534
Do you like these?
I'll buy them for you.

491
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,800
Thank you,
but I don't eat much meat.

492
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,036
- Don't eat meat?
- He says they are knives from West.

493
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,476
You put them on your feet to cut meat.

494
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:02,539
They are ice skates.

495
01:07:02,617 --> 01:07:05,085
You put them on your feet...

496
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:06,485
to skate...

497
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:09,217
to glide...
sort of dance on ice.

498
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,190
- Yeah.
- Why?

499
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,889
- Why not?
- It's another fool's pleasure.

500
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,101
Let's get them.
How mu...

501
01:07:27,108 --> 01:07:29,702
No, for this?

502
01:07:29,778 --> 01:07:31,371
Ten.

503
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,583
And for this?

504
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,585
Did you see?

505
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,420
Did you see that?

506
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:55,264
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No, thank you. I'm okay.

507
01:07:55,336 --> 01:07:58,898
Here we go. Up.

508
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:03,070
- You okay? Did you bang your head?
- No, I'm having fun.

509
01:08:03,144 --> 01:08:05,476
- You must hold on.
- Watch me!

510
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,359
- Do not look too much at the ground.
- All right.

511
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,488
- Look only into my eyes.
- Yes, all right.

512
01:08:40,815 --> 01:08:44,307
Can I help you?
Here, take my hand.

513
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,961
- Are you happy?
- Very happy.

514
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:22,587
<i>I try to picture you, Rolf...</i>

515
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,354
<i>and this is what I see:</i>

516
01:09:25,426 --> 01:09:28,658
<i>a young boy who is strong</i>
<i>and bright...</i>

517
01:09:30,064 --> 01:09:33,091
<i>a boy filled with curiosity</i>
<i>about life...</i>

518
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:39,164
<i>a boy who isn't afraid</i>
<i>to learn from his mistakes.</i>

519
01:10:01,963 --> 01:10:03,488
Hello, married woman.

520
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:07,364
Hello, bachelor man.

521
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,773
Congratulations.

522
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:20,279
Well, come in.

523
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,546
<i>The Japanese army is facing</i>
<i>a growing challenge...</i>

524
01:10:23,618 --> 01:10:26,052
<i>not from China's unified front...</i>

525
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,350
<i>but from the powerful</i>
<i>Chinese Communist Army.</i>

526
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:30,789
<i>Under the control</i>
<i>of Mao Tse-tung...</i>

527
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:37,590
The rumor is that
the Communists have taken over...

528
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,463
the whole of North and Central China.

529
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,435
Rumor? It's a fact.

530
01:10:42,503 --> 01:10:45,371
Ngawang keeps me up-to-date
on all China's war news.

531
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,114
So, how are things at Kungo Tsarong's?

532
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,649
Frankly, I wouldn't know.
I moved out five months ago.

533
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:09,128
Really? Has it been this long
since we have seen you?

534
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,328
- Apparently it has.
- And have you been busy?

535
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:16,462
This is why I'm extremely busy...

536
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:19,564
since I've been hired to survey
the entire city of Lhasa.

537
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:25,903
Unfortunately, your place is too
far out for me to include it on my map.

538
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:29,614
We like our privacy.

539
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,850
Yes, apparently so.

540
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,024
What about women?
Have you met anyone you like?

541
01:11:40,595 --> 01:11:41,994
Women.

542
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:45,295
Since I failed miserably
with an Austrian wife...

543
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,029
an exotic failure with
a Tibetan wife seems misguided.

544
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:52,005
But to answer your question,
no, I haven't. You?

545
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:58,311
A friend's good fortune
is a blessing.

546
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,314
I'm sorry you resent ours.

547
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,783
You must be very lonely and sad.

548
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:31,170
The war is over!

549
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,975
Have the Communists won?

550
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:35,983
Your war, my friend.
Germany has surrendered.

551
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:47,662
- Where are you going?
- Back home. Austria.

552
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:10,110
Mr. Harrer, letter.

553
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:18,019
We miss you.

554
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,860
I miss you.

555
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:41,538
"Dear Mr. Heinrich Harrer:

556
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,948
You are not my father.

557
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:47,579
Please stop writing me letters.

558
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:49,715
Rolf Immendorf."

559
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,545
Honorable Harry Harrer?

560
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,023
- Yes?
- A letter for you.

561
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,497
The Honorable Heinrich Harrer
doesn't want any more letters.

562
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:36,663
It is from the Great Mother
of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

563
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,592
Thank you for coming, Mr. Harrer.

564
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,695
Thank you for inviting me,
Great Mother.

565
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:25,046
Do you know the rules
of protocol concerning my son?

566
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:32,051
Not exact... I know one bows
and performs prostrations.

567
01:15:33,628 --> 01:15:36,096
When you are in the presence
of His Holiness...

568
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:38,462
you must always be standing...

569
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:42,470
bent in obeisance,
hands folded in supplication.

570
01:15:42,537 --> 01:15:46,564
If seated, you must always
be seated lower than he.

571
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:50,600
Never look him in the eye.
Never speak before he does.

572
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:53,738
Always refer to him
as "Your Holiness."

573
01:15:53,814 --> 01:15:57,841
Never turn your back to him.
And never, never touch him.

574
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,355
He is the reincarnation
of Avalokiteshvara...

575
01:16:01,422 --> 01:16:03,390
the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

576
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,962
After his recognition,
he was renamed...

577
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:13,161
Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang
Yeshi Tenzin Gyatso...

578
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:17,967
Holy Lord, Gentle Glory,
Eloquent, Compassionate...

579
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:22,806
Learned Defender of the Faith,
Ocean of Wisdom.

580
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:27,948
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama,
would like to meet you.

581
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:35,750
As his advisors have not permitted
a private audience with you...

582
01:16:35,823 --> 01:16:41,284
His Holiness has asked me to bring you
along to my monthly audience.

583
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:52,471
I'd be honored and moved.

584
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:54,855
Yellow head.

585
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:07,230
You have hair on your arms too?
And legs?

586
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,610
- How about you?
- Mr. Harrer.

587
01:19:24,525 --> 01:19:26,891
It's an honor to meet you,
Your Holiness.

588
01:19:39,673 --> 01:19:41,231
Do you like movies?

589
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:46,105
You know, I haven't seen a movie
in about eight years.

590
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:49,775
- But as I recall, yes, very much.
- So do I.

591
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:54,787
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I have a movie projector. And films.

592
01:19:54,855 --> 01:19:59,020
I want to build a movie house.
Here, at the Potala.

593
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:02,461
- With seats and everything.
- Seats would be advisable.

594
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:04,362
Can you build it?

595
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,427
- Excuse me?
- Can you build a movie house for me?

596
01:20:09,503 --> 01:20:13,304
My advisors cannot disapprove,
and you will be well paid.

597
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,572
And you will have to come here every day
to build it, every single day.

598
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,877
When you are here, you'll visit me. We
can have conversations on many topics.

599
01:20:20,948 --> 01:20:23,610
I would like to learn
about the world you come from.

600
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:27,451
For example, where is Paris, France?
And what's a Molotov cocktail?

601
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:29,284
And who is Jack the Ripper?

602
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,615
You can tell me many things.

603
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:41,033
I'm proud to be of service,
Your Holiness.

604
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,859
What is the problem?

605
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,524
Worms.

606
01:21:09,597 --> 01:21:12,088
Please, no more hurting worms.

607
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,293
- Please.
- Worms?

608
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:19,431
In a past life, this innocent worm
could have been your mother.

609
01:21:19,506 --> 01:21:21,440
Please, no more hurting.

610
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,444
It's impossible. Please, no more.

611
01:21:26,413 --> 01:21:28,779
But you see, Tibetans believe...

612
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:32,341
all living creatures were
their mothers in a past life.

613
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:36,823
So we must show them respect
and repay their kindness.

614
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:40,760
And never, never
harm anything that lives.

615
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:44,265
You can't ask a devout people
to disregard a precious teaching.

616
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:46,265
Yes, but Your Holiness...

617
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:52,501
with true respect,
we can't possibly...

618
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:57,640
I'm sorry, but we can't
possibly rescue all the worms...

619
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:00,545
not if you want a theater
finished in this lifetime.

620
01:22:00,614 --> 01:22:03,880
You have a clever mind.
Think of a solution.

621
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:07,251
And in the meantime, you can
explain to me what is an elevator.

622
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,885
Antarctica.
That's down below.

623
01:22:46,427 --> 01:22:47,359
Here.

624
01:22:49,797 --> 01:22:51,823
Fantastic.

625
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:58,872
England.

626
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,506
Don't look at me for help.

627
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,913
Here?

628
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:17,122
Shift.

629
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,386
Oh, I know him.
Honk. Hello!

630
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:25,288
Turn!

631
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,269
Brake!

632
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:05,337
The robe of a minister is so much finer
than your old brown robe, isn't it?

633
01:24:06,573 --> 01:24:08,097
Please.

634
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,405
Everyone, please.

635
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,810
You must be very clever
to get such a good promotion.

636
01:24:13,981 --> 01:24:16,416
I did not intend to be
a secretary forever.

637
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:18,850
Apparently so.

638
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,649
Well, congratulations.

639
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:37,130
Evil omen!

640
01:24:43,444 --> 01:24:46,676
<i>From his headquarters</i>
<i>in Peking...</i>

641
01:24:46,747 --> 01:24:49,876
<i>the Chairman, Mao Tse-tung,</i>
<i>was triumphantly proclaimed leader...</i>

642
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,975
<i>of the new</i>
<i>People's Republic of China.</i>

643
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:58,881
<i>Chairman Mao vowed that the first task</i>
<i>of the Communist regime...</i>

644
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,190
<i>is to reunite</i>
<i>the Chinese motherland.</i>

645
01:25:02,262 --> 01:25:05,288
<i>He declared that</i>
<i>the remote kingdom of Tibet...</i>

646
01:25:05,365 --> 01:25:08,391
<i>is an integral part</i>
<i>of the Chinese territory...</i>

647
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,494
<i>and must join</i>
<i>the great new republic.</i>

648
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:13,039
"...and must join
the great new republic."

649
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,703
People's Republic of China
is advised...

650
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:21,943
the government of Tibet
recognizes no foreign sovereign.

651
01:25:22,015 --> 01:25:24,506
We are an independent nation.

652
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:28,283
All the Chinese officials will be
expelled from the borders of Tibet.

653
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:31,158
We wish you a happy return
to your homeland.

654
01:25:31,225 --> 01:25:35,025
Have a safe and pleasant journey
back to China.

655
01:25:35,095 --> 01:25:39,192
May you have a safe and
pleasant journey back to China.

656
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:44,532
We wish you a happy return
to your homeland.

657
01:25:44,605 --> 01:25:46,971
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

658
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,077
Let me see.

659
01:25:52,579 --> 01:25:58,381
You have a very long lifeline,
unlike others here.

660
01:26:57,244 --> 01:27:00,442
When we are facing the light,
it's day, yes?

661
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:03,074
When we are in shadow,
it's night.

662
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:07,087
So if the sun is just rising
in Lhasa...

663
01:27:08,055 --> 01:27:10,854
that means it is just setting...

664
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:14,326
in New York City, perhaps.

665
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:17,831
That's why it can't be the same time
in every place.

666
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:21,835
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!

667
01:27:50,797 --> 01:27:52,731
Tell me more.

668
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:57,332
What else do you want to know?

669
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:02,801
In a few moments, you will be
entering the world of mass media.

670
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:05,310
I can hear news
from all over the planet?

671
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,212
I don't know if they have live
broadcasts from the Tonga Islands...

672
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,979
but generally speaking, yeah.

673
01:28:12,052 --> 01:28:14,850
Do you listen to news
from your country?

674
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:18,948
From Austria?
No, not really.

675
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:20,994
Give me some light, Ku-Dun.

676
01:28:21,061 --> 01:28:24,725
- Why? It's your home.
- Not anymore it isn't.

677
01:28:24,798 --> 01:28:27,426
But don't you have
friends and family there?

678
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:30,130
A few friends, no family.

679
01:28:31,838 --> 01:28:34,136
Keep the light steady,
Your Holiness.

680
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:38,573
Why? Is everyone dead?

681
01:28:41,048 --> 01:28:44,449
Do you know there's another sentence
construction aside from the question?

682
01:28:47,421 --> 01:28:49,753
I was married,
but I'm divorced.

683
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:53,216
What did you do?

684
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:06,104
I didn't want a child,
so I ran away to climb a mountain.

685
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:08,438
You have a child?

686
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:13,775
Although I've never seen him.

687
01:29:15,015 --> 01:29:18,975
All right. Let me show you
how this thing works.

688
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:38,636
- Give it all you've got.
- Yes, Mr. Harrer.

689
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,514
Happy Christmas.

690
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:24,015
Thank you.

691
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:38,693
- What is this special occasion?
- This is Christmas.

692
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:42,798
And this is for you, my friend.
Go on.

693
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:33,386
<i>"I found it in a shop</i>
<i>in the Barkhor.</i>

694
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:37,850
<i>It has traveled a long way</i>
<i>and finally come back home.</i>

695
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:41,382
<i>Thank you for your friendship.</i>
<i>Heinrich. "</i>

696
01:32:05,418 --> 01:32:07,353
It is incredible.

697
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,324
Thank you for saving my life.

698
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:25,434
<i>... must be liberated</i>
<i>from religious oppressors.</i>

699
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:27,439
<i>Tibetans must be reunited...</i>

700
01:32:27,507 --> 01:32:29,305
<i>- with their brothers and sisters...</i>
- Turn that off.

701
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:32,676
<i>- of the great family of new China.</i>
- I'm very sorry.

702
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:35,716
<i>Foreigners control</i>
<i>Tibet's corrupt government.</i>

703
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:40,185
<i>Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated</i>
<i>from foreign imperialists.</i>

704
01:32:40,253 --> 01:32:43,279
<i>Tibet's million serfs</i>
<i>must be freed.</i>

705
01:32:43,356 --> 01:32:46,451
How many foreigners
are there in Tibet?

706
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:49,051
You, Heinrich.

707
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:50,791
<i>Tibet will be liberated.</i>

708
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:57,220
He asked for you, Mr. Harrer.

709
01:34:11,244 --> 01:34:16,444
They were destroying the village
I was born in, Takster in Amdo.

710
01:34:16,516 --> 01:34:18,849
It was terrible.

711
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:22,514
It was just a dream.
You had a bad dream. That's all.

712
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:26,525
But it was so real.
Where did it come from?

713
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:31,855
My mind could never imagine
such terrible things.

714
01:35:14,742 --> 01:35:19,610
I can't sleep.
I'm afraid the dream will come back.

715
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:24,943
A couple of insomniacs.

716
01:35:27,854 --> 01:35:29,447
Tell me a story.

717
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,690
Tell me a story
about climbing mountains.

718
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:39,926
That's one way to fall asleep.
Those stories bore even me.

719
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,264
Then tell me
what you love about it.

720
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,769
What...

721
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:50,976
The absolute simplicity.
That's what I love.

722
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:55,706
When you're climbing,
your mind is clear...

723
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:58,114
freed of all confusions.

724
01:35:58,185 --> 01:35:59,981
You have focus.

725
01:36:01,488 --> 01:36:05,152
And suddenly
the light becomes sharper...

726
01:36:05,225 --> 01:36:07,854
sounds are richer...

727
01:36:07,927 --> 01:36:10,488
and you are filled with...

728
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:14,125
the deep, powerful presence of life.

729
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,103
I've only felt that way
one other time.

730
01:36:23,176 --> 01:36:25,007
When?

731
01:36:29,716 --> 01:36:31,775
In your presence, Ku-Dun.

732
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:36,220
The Chinese have already secured
much of the northern border regions.

733
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:38,185
The Chinese have already secured
much of the northern border regions.

734
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:41,591
They have ransacked a village,
destroyed the monasteries...

735
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:44,426
burnt scriptures
and defaced holy relics.

736
01:36:44,497 --> 01:36:46,556
We've been told they've
even killed some monks...

737
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:49,864
- Which village?
- Takster in Amdo.

738
01:36:49,936 --> 01:36:52,962
It's where His Holiness was born.

739
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:05,417
Go ahead.

740
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,756
When you were defense minister
to the previous Dalai Lama...

741
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:13,315
then you wanted to
reorganize the army.

742
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:15,328
Can you do it now?

743
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:19,890
The People's Liberation Army
is one million troops strong.

744
01:37:19,966 --> 01:37:23,493
We have 8,000 men
with 50 pieces of artillery...

745
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:26,061
and a few hundred mortars
and machine guns.

746
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:27,801
The task is hopeless.

747
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,365
Then you refuse
the appointment, do you?

748
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:35,546
No. I accept it with honor.

749
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:39,445
You two gentlemen know about wars.

750
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,920
What type of weapon
do you recommend?

751
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,529
It seems the Chinese troops are
advancing toward our northern borders.

752
01:37:58,605 --> 01:38:01,131
Where's His Holiness?

753
01:38:01,207 --> 01:38:03,233
<i>The glory of</i>
<i>a British coronation.</i>

754
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:06,336
<i>Nowhere in the world</i>
<i>is there anything half so wonderful.</i>

755
01:38:06,412 --> 01:38:09,576
<i>Only once or twice in the life of each</i>
<i>one of us comes such a day as this...</i>

756
01:38:09,649 --> 01:38:12,311
<i>when we know that we are watching</i>
<i>history in the making...</i>

757
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:16,253
<i>when we know that generations to come</i>
<i>will look back on this day...</i>

758
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:19,520
<i>for May 12, 1937, will be</i>
<i>one of the dates in history...</i>

759
01:38:19,592 --> 01:38:23,154
<i>that schoolchildren will learn about</i>
<i>maybe a thousand years from now.</i>

760
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:24,822
<i>Every moment</i>
<i>the thrill of excitement...</i>

761
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:29,426
Do you think someday people will
look at Tibet on the movie screen...

762
01:38:29,502 --> 01:38:31,493
and wonder what happened to us?

763
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,335
<i>The coronation coach moves forward.</i>

764
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:35,875
I don't know.

765
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:38,036
Don't you have all the answers?

766
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:44,149
I don't.

767
01:38:51,457 --> 01:38:55,121
<i>On the same field where Tibetans</i>
<i>traditionally gathered for picnics...</i>

768
01:38:55,194 --> 01:38:57,162
<i>ground was cleared</i>
<i>to build an airstrip...</i>

769
01:38:57,230 --> 01:39:00,722
<i>so that the plane carrying</i>
<i>three Chinese generals could land.</i>

770
01:39:00,801 --> 01:39:04,395
<i>Nearby, the Tibetan army</i>
<i>practiced its maneuvers.</i>

771
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,201
<i>Some of the soldiers</i>
<i>wear ancient mesh armor.</i>

772
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:10,710
<i>They bring old muskets</i>
<i>and spears as artillery.</i>

773
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:16,375
<i>The spectacle of a peace-loving nation,</i>
<i>vainly attempting to create a military.</i>

774
01:39:16,449 --> 01:39:19,613
<i>The fears of war</i>
<i>on my friends' faces...</i>

775
01:39:19,686 --> 01:39:24,283
<i>strike a deeply buried</i>
<i>personal chord.</i>

776
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:27,054
<i>Echoes of the aggressions</i>
<i>of my own country...</i>

777
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:30,118
<i>the will to overpower</i>
<i>weaker peoples...</i>

778
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:33,291
<i>bring shame to me.</i>

779
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:37,827
<i>I shudder to recall how once long ago</i>
<i>I embraced the same beliefs...</i>

780
01:39:37,904 --> 01:39:39,963
<i>how at one time I was, in fact...</i>

781
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:44,271
<i>no different from</i>
<i>these intolerant Chinese.</i>

782
01:39:46,012 --> 01:39:48,503
<i>The Tibetans say an enemy</i>
<i>is the greatest teacher...</i>

783
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:51,710
<i>because only an enemy can help</i>
<i>develop patience and compassion.</i>

784
01:39:52,819 --> 01:39:55,686
<i>They believe with rock-like faith</i>
<i>that the power of their religion...</i>

785
01:39:55,756 --> 01:39:58,315
<i>will protect them</i>
<i>against these Chinese.</i>

786
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:02,154
<i>In preparation for</i>
<i>the generals' visit...</i>

787
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:05,323
<i>sacred ceremonies are performed</i>
<i>throughout Lhasa.</i>

788
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:10,597
<i>Sculptures of deities have been carved</i>
<i>with great care in butter.</i>

789
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:15,369
<i>As the sun melts them, they become</i>
<i>a reminder that nothing lasts.</i>

790
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:32,487
<i>The rising star of the cabinet,</i>
<i>Minister Ngawang Jigme...</i>

791
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:35,153
<i>made an offering of his own</i>
<i>to greet the Chinese generals...</i>

792
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,220
<i>and lead them through Lhasa.</i>

793
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:43,301
Raising their flag is an honor
the Chinese don't deserve.

794
01:40:43,369 --> 01:40:46,896
When you are not strong enough to fight,
you should embrace your enemy.

795
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:50,171
With both arms around you,
he cannot point a gun at you.

796
01:40:50,243 --> 01:40:53,735
Nothing in politics
is a matter of honor, my friend.

797
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:03,743
History repeats itself,
even in paradise.

798
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:08,676
General, we shall have
our audience with His...

799
01:42:34,014 --> 01:42:38,474
General, the monks have been making
this mandala of sand for many days.

800
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,318
It is a symbol of
enlightenment and peace.

801
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:43,720
General!

802
01:42:56,069 --> 01:42:59,731
We do not sit lower than he does.

803
01:42:59,805 --> 01:43:01,966
But, General,
it is our custom.

804
01:43:02,576 --> 01:43:04,510
I can sit down there.

805
01:43:21,395 --> 01:43:24,125
Your Holiness,
this is General Chang Jing Wu...

806
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:27,530
General Than Gua,
General Than Gua San.

807
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,434
They wish to have
an audience with you.

808
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:35,171
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

809
01:43:36,676 --> 01:43:41,376
They are promising regional autonomy
and religious freedom...

810
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:46,385
if Tibet accepts that China
be its political master.

811
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:54,320
Until I attain my majority, the
regent is the political leader of Tibet.

812
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:56,828
You should have requested
an audience with him...

813
01:43:56,896 --> 01:43:58,921
to discuss these important matters
of the world.

814
01:44:00,766 --> 01:44:04,203
My experience of such things
is limited.

815
01:44:05,771 --> 01:44:08,365
I am a simple Buddhist monk.

816
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:13,072
All I know is the scripture
and the words of Lord Buddha.

817
01:44:13,145 --> 01:44:18,310
He said, "All beings tremble
before danger and death.

818
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:20,353
Life is dear to all.

819
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:25,356
When a man considers this,
he does not kill or cause to kill."

820
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:27,016
You must understand.

821
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:31,860
These words are ingrained
in the heart of every Tibetan.

822
01:44:31,931 --> 01:44:37,369
It is why we are a peaceful people
who reject violence on principle.

823
01:44:38,971 --> 01:44:43,408
I pray you will see this is
our greatest strength...

824
01:44:43,476 --> 01:44:45,774
not our weakness.

825
01:44:46,846 --> 01:44:49,314
I thank you for your visit.

826
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:55,314
An offering
to the Enlightened Ones.

827
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:13,273
Religion is poison.

828
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:24,073
The Chinese have attacked
the Tibetan frontier near Den-Go.

829
01:46:36,756 --> 01:46:40,921
"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops
of the 1st and 2nd Field Armies...

830
01:46:40,993 --> 01:46:45,430
under the overall command
of General Chang Jing Wu...

831
01:46:45,498 --> 01:46:49,127
attacked the Tibetan frontier
near Den-Go.

832
01:46:49,202 --> 01:46:53,161
The Tibetan army believes
an attack on Chamdo is imminent.

833
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:56,208
<i>Ngawang Jigme,</i>
<i>our newly appointed governor...</i>

834
01:46:56,275 --> 01:46:58,539
<i>is preparing to send troops</i>
<i>toward the Chinese column...</i>

835
01:46:58,612 --> 01:47:01,479
<i>in order to stop</i>
<i>their progression. "</i>

836
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:06,380
As you know, Chamdo
is the gateway to Tibet.

837
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:09,251
If Chamdo falls,
the whole of Tibet will fall.

838
01:47:09,322 --> 01:47:12,587
If I did not know that, I would not
have been appointed governor.

839
01:47:12,658 --> 01:47:18,188
You do realize our troops are committed
to fighting the Chinese to the last man.

840
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:20,358
<i>They would rather die than surrender.</i>

841
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:26,865
Rest assured, there will be no surrender
as long as I am in Chamdo.

842
01:50:49,908 --> 01:50:52,309
Radio Lhasa.

843
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,541
Now.

844
01:50:55,614 --> 01:50:58,448
We request permission
to surrender.

845
01:50:58,518 --> 01:51:01,453
- But there will be no surrender...
- I said, "Radio Lhasa."

846
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,251
Permission to surrender now.

847
01:51:50,737 --> 01:51:54,365
<i>We lost the war in 11 days,</i>
<i>Heinrich.</i>

848
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:57,103
<i>This surrender is</i>
<i>our death sentence.</i>

849
01:51:58,444 --> 01:52:03,939
<i>And I'm afraid our friend</i>
<i>Ngawang Jigme has issued it.</i>

850
01:52:04,016 --> 01:52:09,386
<i>He abandoned Chamdo and then</i>
<i>destroyed the ammunition dumps.</i>

851
01:52:10,657 --> 01:52:13,956
Without weapons and ammunition...

852
01:52:14,027 --> 01:52:16,962
there was no hope for
the troops who wanted to fight.

853
01:52:18,297 --> 01:52:21,631
<i>Our guerrillas could have held</i>
<i>the mountain passes for months...</i>

854
01:52:22,534 --> 01:52:24,399
<i>even years.</i>

855
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:29,465
<i>It would have bought us time to make</i>
<i>appeals for help to other nations.</i>

856
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:31,908
<i>Now it's lost.</i>

857
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:34,172
<i>They broke down the gates.</i>

858
01:53:22,561 --> 01:53:24,654
Hello, my friend.

859
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:33,505
We did what was the best
for our country...

860
01:53:34,606 --> 01:53:36,541
for Tibet.

861
01:53:37,777 --> 01:53:42,180
On the way to Lhasa, I would see
Tibetans wearing these jackets.

862
01:53:42,247 --> 01:53:44,408
"Chinese soldiers.
Very nice.

863
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:49,011
Give food, clothes, money.
Very nice."

864
01:53:49,087 --> 01:53:52,716
It's strange to me that something
so harmless as a jacket...

865
01:53:52,792 --> 01:53:56,694
could symbolize
such a great lie.

866
01:54:01,201 --> 01:54:03,930
After all these years, you still
do not understand Tibetan ways.

867
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:08,731
To return a gift is unforgivable.

868
01:54:11,778 --> 01:54:15,213
A man who betrays his culture
should not preach about its customs.

869
01:54:22,055 --> 01:54:24,989
There was a time
I would have wished you dead...

870
01:54:25,057 --> 01:54:27,252
but your shame
will be your torture.

871
01:54:27,327 --> 01:54:30,762
And your torture
will be your life.

872
01:54:30,829 --> 01:54:33,162
I wish it to be long.

873
01:54:44,944 --> 01:54:47,742
We pray that His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama...

874
01:54:47,814 --> 01:54:51,716
will be granted the power
to unify his people.

875
01:54:51,783 --> 01:54:56,720
We humbly ask the Tibetan government
to honor our request...

876
01:54:56,788 --> 01:55:00,953
and let the Dalai Lama
attain his political majority.

877
01:55:55,547 --> 01:55:58,483
You have the entire palace
in a panic.

878
01:56:00,453 --> 01:56:03,182
I'm hiding from the world
for a day.

879
01:56:06,259 --> 01:56:09,023
Kind of difficult
in a glasshouse, no?

880
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:17,099
It's <i>The Moonlight...</i>

881
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:19,161
by Debussy.

882
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:25,274
What else do you know
about this song?

883
01:58:03,542 --> 01:58:04,826
Him, him and him.

884
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,109
Him, him and him.

885
01:58:18,957 --> 01:58:22,859
I hope you've received your invitation
to the enthronement ceremony.

886
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:24,190
Yes. Thank you.

887
01:58:24,262 --> 01:58:26,993
- It's next week.
- Thank you.

888
01:58:40,613 --> 01:58:43,639
Do I look like an egghead?

889
01:58:43,716 --> 01:58:45,911
No, they suit you.

890
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:50,720
We have a saying in Tibet...

891
01:58:50,789 --> 01:58:55,351
"If the problem can be solved,
there is no use worrying about it.

892
01:58:55,427 --> 01:58:58,295
If it can't be solved,
worrying will do no good."

893
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:01,088
So stop worrying.

894
01:59:02,534 --> 01:59:07,029
You have to leave Tibet.
Your life's at great risk.

895
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:13,408
Forgive my presumption, but I made
arrangements to get you out safely.

896
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:17,141
We should leave after the enthronement.
The Chinese would never expect it...

897
01:59:17,216 --> 01:59:22,448
How can I help people if I run away from
them? What kind of leader would I be?

898
01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:26,621
I have to stay here.

899
01:59:26,692 --> 01:59:29,057
Serving others
is my path to liberation.

900
01:59:39,939 --> 01:59:42,930
- Then I don't go either.
- Why not?

901
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:46,171
Because you are my path
to liberation.

902
01:59:48,381 --> 01:59:53,546
The Buddha said, "Salvation
does not come from the sight of me.

903
01:59:53,618 --> 01:59:57,247
It demands strenuous effort
and practice.

904
01:59:57,323 --> 02:00:02,158
So work hard and seek
your own salvation diligently."

905
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:06,994
I am not your son...

906
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:11,298
and I never thought of you
as my father.

907
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:15,497
You were much too informal
with me for that.

908
02:00:26,685 --> 02:00:29,176
Do you ever think about him?

909
02:00:43,269 --> 02:00:45,668
And what do you think about?

910
02:00:56,948 --> 02:01:00,850
It's not the conscious thought
really.

911
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:03,354
It's just always there.

912
02:01:11,764 --> 02:01:15,029
When I crossed Tibet,
he was with me.

913
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:17,432
When I came to Lhasa,
he was with me.

914
02:01:17,502 --> 02:01:19,766
When I sit beside you,
he's...

915
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:23,731
there with me.

916
02:01:28,079 --> 02:01:32,210
I can't even imagine how I pictured
the world without him in it.

917
02:01:35,186 --> 02:01:38,384
Then you should go home
and be his father.

918
02:01:45,597 --> 02:01:47,429
I know.

919
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:52,065
You have finished
your job with me.

920
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:57,167
But you have to stay
for my enthronement.

921
02:01:57,243 --> 02:02:00,804
I want you to see me
in all my pomp and glory.

922
02:02:03,882 --> 02:02:06,010
It'd be a pleasure, my friend.

923
02:03:24,662 --> 02:03:26,823
From the government of Tibet...

924
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:29,493
to Your Holiness,
the fourteenth Dalai Lama...

925
02:03:29,568 --> 02:03:31,502
we ask you to rule your people...

926
02:03:31,569 --> 02:03:36,337
as the spiritual and
temporal leader of Tibet.

927
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:46,280
By your prayers and wishes,
I humbly accept.

928
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:44,774
Butter tea.
It was never my cup of tea.

929
02:04:48,247 --> 02:04:52,342
- One was enough.
- Yes, we must follow the custom.

930
02:04:52,417 --> 02:04:57,219
A fresh cup of tea is poured
for the loved one departing.

931
02:05:02,094 --> 02:05:06,359
It sits untouched,
waiting for his return.

932
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:11,792
May all travelers find happiness
wherever they go.

933
02:06:11,863 --> 02:06:17,063
Without any effort may they accomplish
whatever they set out to do.

934
02:06:17,136 --> 02:06:20,332
And having safely
returned to the shore...

935
02:06:20,405 --> 02:06:25,172
may they be joyfully reunited
with their relatives.

936
02:06:36,889 --> 02:06:38,355
Mr. Harrer...

937
02:06:42,261 --> 02:06:43,694
from His Holiness.

938
02:08:16,587 --> 02:08:19,113
- Hello, Horst.
- Hello, Heinrich.

939
02:08:19,190 --> 02:08:22,921
Rolf, come out to meet him.

940
02:08:22,994 --> 02:08:25,930
No, I don't want to.

941
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:29,032
May I?

942
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:11,599
Rolf, take your time.

943
02:10:28,554 --> 02:10:30,578
Well done, son.

944
02:10:31,657 --> 02:10:33,090
Well done.
