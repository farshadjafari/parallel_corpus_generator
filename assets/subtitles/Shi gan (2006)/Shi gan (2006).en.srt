1
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,487
I'm on my way!

2
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,896
I'm sorry.
I'll fix it up for you.

3
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,502
Hold on. Wait here one sec.

4
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,405
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Thanks.

5
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
Hey.

6
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,303
Why? I just had a look.

7
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,607
After two years,
you're sick of me, huh?

8
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,079
No way.

9
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,486
You even gave away your dog
after you got sick of it.

10
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,679
A dog and a person are different.

11
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,589
What's this?

12
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,092
- Who is it?
- Interested in her, too?

13
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,990
She looks like a lunatic.

14
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,598
How could she laugh like this?
She looks scary.

15
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,104
What would you like?

16
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,801
- What's with your attitude?
- Pardon?

17
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,207
Can't you be nicer to customers?

18
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,275
- I'm sorry.
- I'll have coffee.

19
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,277
Why? Feel bad that I got mad at
a girl you're interested in?

20
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,791
Hello?
Yes?

21
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,584
- I'll call you if there's a problem.
- Okay.

22
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,291
Did you see that?

23
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,390
My license plate got bent.

24
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,503
- Why'd you take her card?
- Just in case there's a problem later.

25
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,300
- But why'd you give her yours?
- Just because.

26
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,205
Just because?
And why'd you open the door for her?

27
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,902
Didn't they have hands?

28
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,809
Do you work here?

29
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,778
- Are you jealous?
- Give me her card.

30
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,685
What are you doing?

31
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,883
You said your car was okay!
Why do you need her card?

32
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,790
- Aren't you being too much?
- What? What's too much?

33
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,386
Those girls talk to you smiling,
and you take it like an idiot.

34
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,501
And why'd you park for them?
Are you their friend?

35
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,100
Aren't you the one who's too much?

36
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,001
You should've said the insurance
will cover it and hurry back.

37
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,005
But why'd you give in so easily?

38
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,507
You're overreacting.
It was nothing.

39
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,010
What?
It was nothing?

40
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,276
Seh-hee!

41
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,381
You should've just apologized.
But why'd you give him your card?

42
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,687
Who are you to yell at me?

43
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,195
Who are you to give your card
to my boyfriend?

44
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,892
Did you expecthe'd call
a slut like you?

45
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,899
Hey.

46
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,094
I'm sorry.

47
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,499
Sorry about what?

48
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,003
They're sluts anyway.

49
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,802
You crazy bitch!

50
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,610
Crazy bitch?

51
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,407
Yeah, I'm crazy!
So what?

52
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,310
- Screw you!
- Sit down, Hee-sun.

53
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,781
I'm very sorry.

54
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,878
Stop. This is embarrassing.

55
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,487
Embarrassing?
You're ashamed of me?

56
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,793
She must love you very much.
I envy you.

57
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,406
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,278
Look at me.

59
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,593
I'm crazy, aren't I?

60
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:50,098
I wanna poke out girls' eyes
when they just look at you.

61
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,703
Sorry for always having
the same boring face.

62
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,892
Seh-hee.

63
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,001
I'm sorry, I've been tired lately.

64
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,377
You're tired of seeing
my same body everyday.

65
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,080
Don't talk like that.
It's not because of that.

66
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,588
Do you remember that girl
who hit your car?

67
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,788
No.

68
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,491
Liar.

69
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,492
Be honest.

70
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,594
What?

71
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,997
She'd look pretty if naked.

72
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,709
With big tits.

73
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,084
What are you doing?

74
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,879
Are you thinking of her tits?

75
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,186
It's okay.
Think about her.

76
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,485
This hand is hers.

77
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,389
You know, you're getting weirder.

78
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,000
Think of me as her.

79
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,804
It's okay.

80
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,501
Did you imagine sleeping with her?

81
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,306
What are you talking about?

82
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,581
Tell me the truth.
Did you think of her?

83
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,178
You told me to think of her.

84
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,097
Hey, that hurt.

85
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,507
I bit you harder before.

86
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,806
- But it hurts now?
- It really hurt, why'd you do that?

87
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,879
I'm sorry for having
the same boring face everyday.

88
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,383
Stop it! I told you
stop talking like that!

89
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,487
Why are you acting so weird?

90
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,280
Let me see.

91
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,185
Look at me!
Stop being so paranoid!

92
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,096
You said to think of her!
What do you expect me to do?

93
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,699
What the hell is this?

94
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,597
You want me to imagine
another girl while having sex.

95
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,204
What the hell is this?
Is this your idea of love?

96
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,677
The number you are calling
is not in service,

97
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,187
The number you are calling
is not in service,

98
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,803
Excuse me.

99
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,911
What happened to room 1005?
No one's there.

100
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,777
Seh-hee? In 1005?

101
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,884
She suddenly moved out yesterday.

102
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,284
Do you know where she moved to?

103
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,888
I don't know.

104
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,485
Okay.

105
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,994
Hi, Yoon-a.

106
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,497
Oh, hi, Ji-woo.

107
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,107
What brings you here?

108
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,405
Do you happen to know
where Seh-hee moved to?

109
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,910
What?

110
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,411
She moved?

111
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,074
To where?

112
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,089
I'll have coffee, please.
And I'm sorry about the other day.

113
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,182
The number you are calling
is not in service,

114
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,612
I don't know if I can make you.

115
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,714
I don't want to be prettier.

116
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,979
Just different. A new face.

117
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,686
Are you tired of your face?

118
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,184
Please do it.

119
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,481
Are you still sure you want it?

120
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,094
This person and this person
are the same.

121
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,490
Do you believe it?

122
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,495
You can never get back
your real face.

123
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,801
Have anyone as your model?

124
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,504
The eyelids need to be
a bit deeper.

125
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,011
Just the tip of the nose
needs to be raised.

126
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,082
And smaller lips.

127
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,683
It won't be difficult.

128
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,876
One moment.

129
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,288
I'll make your jaw and chin
look softer.

130
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,083
Your face will be smaller.

131
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,091
It takes six months
to fully recover.

132
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,895
It will be painful.
Can you take it?

133
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,797
I'll have to
if I want to look new.

134
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,399
Look ahead please.

135
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,906
I'll take your picture now.

136
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,903
Now look this way please.

137
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,591
I'll give you one last chance
to think about it.

138
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,007
Hello?
Hey, Tae-suk.

139
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,274
Now?

140
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,386
Why are you waiting for her
after she disappears like that?

141
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,682
Forget about her.

142
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,185
But how could she do that?

143
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,590
You two went out for two years.

144
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,389
Two years are enough.

145
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,395
- I can't even last six months.
- Enjoy!

146
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,500
Aren't you sick of the same body?

147
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,003
Yeah, when it hits two years,
you start checking out other girls.

148
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,903
But it's not
because there's no love.

149
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,510
It's because there's
no more thrills and turn-ons.

150
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,613
- You got a nose job and a face lift, huh?
- No.

151
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,375
Come on, you got your eyes,
nose and jaw done.

152
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,078
- I said I didn't.
- You did.

153
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:42,983
Let me see your boobs.

154
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,180
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey, hey.

155
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,984
It's none of your business.

156
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:52,689
~ If time never stops running

157
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,197
~ Can I forget you like a dream?

158
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,098
Hey, why are you touching
my partner, you crazy asshole?

159
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,695
~ I miss you tonight

160
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,308
~ My love, my love

161
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,307
You always act like an ass
in these places.

162
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,176
- Hey, I liked her more.
- You should've told me.

163
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,078
Then I'll change seats!

164
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:17,087
~ Are you coming tonight?

165
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,282
If you touch her one more time,
I'll kill you.

166
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,687
But I can touch you, right?

167
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,387
Some drink?

168
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,395
You're too damn noisy!
Stop singing!

169
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,197
- His song is terrible.
- What is that song?

170
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,396
I don't know.

171
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,604
What the hell? Fuck.

172
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,781
You bitch, watch your mouth.

173
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,476
Honey.

174
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,277
What the fuck are you staring at?
Apologize.

175
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,184
Why'd you fucking hit my partner?

176
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,688
Fuck off, asshole.

177
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,489
- That's enough.
- You understand me, right?

178
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,686
Cheers.

179
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:02,596
Honey. Have you read Marquez's
'Memories of My Melancholy Whores'?

180
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,498
Mar, who?
Who fucking cares.

181
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,002
Who wants to screw these girls?

182
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,699
- Don't ask dumb questions.
- Bingo!

183
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,206
Not me. Leave me out.

184
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,372
Hey, we came here for you.
You can't bail, idiot!

185
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,984
I wanna talk with you.

186
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,489
You do? Let's go.

187
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,183
Don't get any wild ideas.

188
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,385
We're just gonna talk.

189
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,291
What? Talk physically?

190
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,488
I love Seh-hee.

191
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,098
You crazy bastard.

192
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,394
All we're gonna do is talk, okay?

193
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,910
I forgot to ask your age.

194
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,206
How old are you?

195
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,690
Honey, wake up.

196
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,293
You just gonna sleep?

197
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,492
Wake up.

198
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,993
Come on, honey.

199
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,398
Hey, is this your idea of talking?

200
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,902
Yeah, raise your arms.

201
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,597
I can't.

202
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,901
- Why not?
- I broke up with my girlfriend.

203
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,502
- You can.
- I can't do this out of respect.

204
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,385
But we're all human, right?

205
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,497
What's going on?

206
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,303
Who did it?

207
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,079
What was that noise?

208
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,777
Damn it.

209
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,787
What the hell are you doing,
you drunk!

210
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,390
You wanna go to the police?

211
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,494
You're supposed to just screw,
not break the window!

212
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:48,297
- Hello?
- Ji-woo, It's me, Yon-hee,

213
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:53,703
Hi, Yon-hee.
It's been a long time.

214
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:58,105
How have you been?
I'm going to hold an exhibition,

215
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,612
Congratulations.

216
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,978
Can you come visit?

217
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,478
Okay, I'll try to make it.

218
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,700
Ji-woo! You made it.

219
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,499
Congratulations.

220
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,099
The artwork is very nice.

221
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,904
It's definitely you, Yon-hee.

222
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,580
Where did you take
all those pictures?

223
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,380
I wish I can go there one day.

224
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,688
You wanna go together sometime?

225
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,085
Did you and Chul-soo break up?

226
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,184
He just disappeared one day.

227
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,293
Why don't you find him?

228
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,591
Why look for someone
who got sick of me and left?

229
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,101
You're seeing someone, right?

230
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,803
She disappeared one day as well.

231
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,200
Really?

232
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,603
She must be with Chul-soo now.

233
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,909
Then that means we can be together.

234
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,796
Let's mind nothing.

235
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,798
- Are you sure?
- You liked me, didn't you?

236
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,101
But you couldn't tell me
because of Chul-soo.

237
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,003
Dummy.

238
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:48,084
I'm rather worn,
but you can have me now.

239
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,287
You're still beautiful.

240
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,710
- Shall we go?
- After I go to the lady's room.

241
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,279
- You wanna come to my place?
- No.

242
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,576
Then, a motel?

243
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,283
I'll see you next time.

244
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,290
What are you talking about?
You asked to be with me.

245
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,290
I think this is wrong.

246
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,093
Are you playing with me?

247
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,698
You called me to make
a fool out of me?

248
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,800
What do you want from me?

249
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,802
Just that you weren't like this
before you went to the lady's room.

250
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,599
Why'd you work me up like that?

251
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,297
Worked up for what?

252
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:20,208
Damn it, I shouldn't have come.

253
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,779
Bye.
I think this is the last time.

254
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,781
Hey, Yon-hee.

255
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,184
Be with me just tonight, okay?

256
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,484
You've changed a lot,
and have no self-pride now.

257
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,485
Okay, okay.

258
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,495
I'll take you home by my car.

259
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,698
Let's talk some more.

260
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,804
What are you doing?

261
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,177
- Keep your promise.
- What promise?

262
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,179
Don't do this.

263
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,383
I'm so lonely.

264
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,794
We're all human.

265
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,179
I'm sorry.

266
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,986
You should realize how happy you are.

267
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,989
Just do well on your part.

268
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,997
Where are you heading?

269
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,734
Hop in. I'll take you there.

270
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,692
Can I take some pictures of you?

271
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:37,788
This is that famous
well-being 'feet bath'.

272
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,094
Your knees are very pretty.

273
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,289
Specially this lady here.

274
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,798
She's exactly my style!

275
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,084
Hyo-nim?

276
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,784
Hi. Nice to meet you.

277
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,486
Hi.

278
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,194
Eun-hae?

279
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,303
That's me. Hello.

280
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,701
Hi.

281
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,701
Hyun-jung?

282
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,806
Hi.

283
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:29,704
Everyone satisfied?

284
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,078
For the one-on-one in 10 minutes.

285
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,377
Applause.

286
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:41,788
How do you like this place?
Not bad, huh?

287
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,888
I'm so happy.

288
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,093
It's the first time ever
for me to have the one I wanted.

289
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,603
I picked you the moment I saw you.

290
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,399
Oh, I see.

291
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,604
What do you think about me?

292
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,208
I'm not too sure yet.

293
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,508
You seem like a nice person.

294
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:08,179
That's just a mannered thing
to say to an unattractive girl.

295
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,081
No. I'm serious.

296
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,886
You liked the long-haired girl?
Eun-hae.

297
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,894
Long hair? Who was that?
I don't remember.

298
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,796
- What's your hobby?
- Well, taking pictures.

299
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,301
Take a picture of me one day.

300
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,598
Sure, great.

301
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:43,786
Shall we go shooting?
With real bullets.

302
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,595
You looked awesome
when you were shooting.

303
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,292
Shooting is great
for relieving stress.

304
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,903
I had a great time today.

305
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,906
If we turn around once...

306
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,570
and make eye contact
then we should meet again.

307
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:50,083
Now, one, two, three.

308
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,588
Hey.

309
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,489
Where are you?
Still with her?

310
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,493
I just got back home.

311
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,896
Damn it, my girl kept
talking about you.

312
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,404
I got annoyed, then gave her
your number and left.

313
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,401
She'll probably call you.

314
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,203
Why'd you give her my number
without asking me?

315
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,508
You weird bastard.

316
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,798
Hello?

317
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,001
Do you realize how late it is?

318
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,612
You sure you gave her my number?

319
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,182
- She hasn't called.
- You crazy bastard.

320
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,082
I'm sleepy as hell.

321
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,381
Hello? Hey!

322
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,095
Welcome!

323
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,394
Here's your coffee.

324
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,492
Enjoy.

325
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,884
I love you,

326
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,185
Do you need more coffee?

327
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:14,884
Yes.

328
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,390
- Welcome!
- It's hot!

329
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,297
I'm sorry.

330
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,995
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

331
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,297
I'm sorry.

332
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:31,701
I'm sorry.

333
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,811
You should've been careful.

334
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,307
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

335
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,876
- Going to the island?
- Yes.

336
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,382
Do you want to try this?

337
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,286
- Throw it, not eat it.
- Yeah.

338
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,786
Like this.
Up.

339
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,790
They're seagulls, right?

340
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,791
Of course.
Think they're eagles?

341
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,236
- I...
- Throw it up.

342
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,480
- How far are you headed?
- To the Sculpture Park.

343
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,277
Really? Hop in.
I'm headed there, too.

344
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,995
- How about this one?
- It's nice.

345
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,400
Yes, isn't it?

346
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,105
Looks like a fireball.

347
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,880
This is fun,
too, isn't it?

348
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,875
Yes.

349
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,384
- Climb up like this.
- I'm okay.

350
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,182
Come on, climb up.

351
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,684
Have you gone inside
that shell before?

352
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,492
- Have you?
- Yes.

353
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,189
What did you do in there?

354
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,502
- Let's take a picture together.
- Okay.

355
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,599
Excuse me!

356
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,801
Could you take a picture of us?

357
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,475
Here you go.

358
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:34,287
To the left a bit.
A bit lower.

359
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,886
Get ready.
One, two, three.

360
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,793
Looks great, doesn't it?

361
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,801
Do you have a girlfriend?

362
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,600
She left me six months ago
without saying a word.

363
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,606
- Without saying anything?
- Yeah.

364
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,104
Are you waiting for her?

365
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,079
Sometimes yes, and sometimes no.

366
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,182
Since time's passed,
I don't know anymore.

367
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,973
Feels like the right fit for my hand.

368
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,385
- I had a great time today.
- Me, too.

369
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,987
- Bye.
- Bye.

370
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,185
Bye.

371
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,892
Welcome.

372
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,477
What's that?
A letter?

373
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,085
Something seems to be...

374
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,687
But I'm not sure.

375
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,783
It looks like 'I love you'
written over and over again.

376
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,093
Is that what you're hoping for?

377
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:28,689
What would you like to order?

378
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,298
- Coffee, please.
- Okay.

379
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,779
I'm sorry.
I forgot it was a letter.

380
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:55,382
It's 'I love you' written
over and over again, right?

381
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,089
I haven't even asked you
your name yet.

382
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,096
- See-hee.
- Seh-hee?

383
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,912
- See...
- What are you doing?

384
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,675
I'm sorry.
I forgot it was a letter.

385
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,577
What can I do?

386
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,785
- How could you laugh now?
- I'm sorry. Are you upset?

387
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,792
- I'll get rid...
- No!

388
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,300
Aren't you being too much?

389
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,602
I said sorry.

390
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,079
Hey. This is a letter
from my girlfriend...

391
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,185
who disappeared without a trace
six months ago.

392
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,682
So how could you write on it?

393
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,484
If you can't forget her so much.

394
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,685
Then why'd you kiss me in the car?

395
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,297
Tell me.
Why did you kiss me?

396
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,989
I'm sorry about the other day.

397
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,294
See-hee, go tidy up over there.

398
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,690
What a weird girl.
She's the one who popped up here.

399
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,591
I'm very sorry about what happened.

400
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,494
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

401
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:53,399
Could you tell me See-hee's number?

402
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:03,110
I'm really lost.

403
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,482
I don't know what to do.

404
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,879
Please call me.
I'll be awake.

405
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,989
Please call me for sure.

406
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:36,406
See-hee, I beg you to call me,
I can't do anything,

407
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,674
I miss you,

408
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:55,584
Come on in.

409
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,096
I'll prepare dinner first.

410
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:10,001
- Watch a DVD if you're bored.
- Okay.

411
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,793
Looks very delicious.

412
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,302
Wait a bit more.

413
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,487
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

414
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:35,989
That's great.

415
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,192
For a guy's place,
how come it's so clean?

416
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,491
Then is your place messy?

417
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,992
Yes.

418
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,603
I don't have much time to clean up.

419
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,505
Then I'll go and clean it for you.

420
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:53,903
Can you really?

421
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,604
Yes.

422
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,083
It's delicious.

423
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,976
I have to go.
Thanks for dinner.

424
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,982
Stay the night.

425
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,180
Next time.

426
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,881
Please stay, Seh-hee.

427
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,389
Seh-hee?

428
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,790
See-hee.

429
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,094
Good night.

430
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,996
See-hee!

431
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,398
I'll go and clean your place later.

432
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,193
Excuse me.

433
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:35,805
Have any old pictures of yourself?
I wanna see you as a kid.

434
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,277
I don't have any.

435
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,975
- Not even one?
- Yes, not even one.

436
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,180
That's strange.

437
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,597
Show it to me.
I bet it's an old photo.

438
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,894
No.

439
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,798
- Show it to me.
- No.

440
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,404
Can't you show it to me?

441
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,402
I wanna see it.

442
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,404
How was it?

443
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,711
It was new to me.

444
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,972
It's the first time
I've felt like this.

445
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,580
Thanks.

446
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,879
Thanks for what?

447
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,083
Just everything.

448
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,785
For all the time that's passed.

449
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,089
Do you love me?

450
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,795
I don't know yet.
I just feel very happy.

451
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,683
Why do you keep smiling?

452
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:29,287
Because I'm happy.
You're kind and a great guy.

453
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,586
Thanks.

454
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,395
But...

455
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,288
Tell me.

456
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,201
Did you love Seh-hee very much?

457
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,899
Yes.

458
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,204
Even now?

459
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,999
Why?

460
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,504
If Seh-hee comes back for you?

461
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,009
She won't come back.

462
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,376
What if she does?

463
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,372
That's what I want to.

464
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,377
Do I look happy?

465
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,681
But I'm sad strangely.

466
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,294
My heart is gonna boom up.

467
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:23,797
What the hell?

468
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,872
Did you just hit me?

469
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,572
Yes.

470
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,274
Why?

471
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,680
I love you.

472
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,390
Sorry, sleep again.

473
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,393
Don't hit me.
I'm gonna be angry.

474
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:30,304
To Dearest Ji-woo,

475
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,115
I tried to forget you but I couldn't,
I want to return to you,

476
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,279
Meet at the cafe on the 20th at two,
Seh-hee

477
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,369
Tell me.
What is it about?

478
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,983
Don't make me so curious.

479
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:50,986
Seh-hee is coming back.

480
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:56,284
So?

481
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,689
I'm sorry.

482
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,598
Why are you sorry?
Are you gonna meet her?

483
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,206
I was very lonely after she left me.

484
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:24,883
So you're meeting me
because you're lonely?

485
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,489
No, that's not true.

486
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,483
Do you still love her?

487
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,592
I think so.

488
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,095
I can't give you up, either.

489
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,101
- I'm sorry.
- No.

490
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,402
I'll meet her and stop her.

491
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,408
- You can't!
- You can't, either!

492
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,579
Who do you think I am?

493
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,977
Think I'm some slut
who comforts you with sex?

494
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,279
Watch your mouth!

495
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,288
- Tell me! What am I to you?
- Get out!

496
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,392
Forget when you sweated on me
like some crazy horse?

497
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:05,289
Am I a whore?

498
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,986
Stop it!
This is embarrassing.

499
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,995
Embarrassing?
You're embarrassed of me?

500
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,798
Hey! Hey!

501
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,396
Damn it.

502
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,598
What are you embarrassed of?
Who made me like this?

503
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,902
- Is this who you are?
- Yeah!

504
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,511
This is me!

505
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:25,478
Kill me first before you go to her!
Kill me first before you go to her!

506
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,173
I really mistook you.

507
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,879
You...

508
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,685
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

509
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,987
You filthy son of a bitch!

510
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,494
Go! Go!

511
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:14,291
The number you are calling
is not in service,

512
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,700
- So what do you want?
- We're not right for each other.

513
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,606
I thought you were
crazy about me, fuck.

514
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,901
Why do you always curse?

515
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,011
- I hate that.
- I'm sorry, shit.

516
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:51,688
How have you been?

517
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,086
I missed you so much.

518
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,401
What is this?

519
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:04,501
It was you on that island?

520
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,409
I wanted to see you somehow.

521
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:12,073
How could you do that?
What kind of crazy act is this?

522
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,677
I was scared of time.

523
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:20,286
- Time that makes everything change.
- So what the hell is this?

524
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:23,485
Were you happy playing with me?

525
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:26,189
Then what the hell am I?

526
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:27,889
What am I?

527
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:32,697
I believed if I'd changed my face
you'd love me longer.

528
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:34,897
But you couldn't forget...

529
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,301
your girl of the past.

530
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,808
And I couldn't stand
being so jealous.

531
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:42,308
That doesn't make sense.
Both of them are you!

532
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,469
No.

533
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,081
I'm not your woman of the past.
I'm a new woman.

534
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,383
You're crazy!

535
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,680
Who are you?
Who are you?

536
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,482
Damn it.

537
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,082
Think this place is
some theatrical stage?

538
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,285
What's with the mask?
And stop being so damn loud.

539
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,191
Haven't you heard of manners?

540
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,095
Think this place is your home?

541
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,395
What the hell is this?

542
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,203
Why'd you fix your face?
Are you crazy?

543
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,400
I was too nervous.

544
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,379
I thought you'd get sick of me
and find a new woman.

545
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:22,575
Think I'm some meathead
who chases after women's bodies?

546
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,579
I love you.

547
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:31,088
You're scary.
You're really scary.

548
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,396
Don't be like this.

549
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,697
Just take off my mask
and see my new face.

550
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:39,794
No.

551
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,698
You're crazy!

552
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,402
You got a problem?

553
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:48,903
Let's take it outside.

554
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,272
Fucking bastard.

555
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:55,181
Min-soo.

556
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,398
Get up, asshole!

557
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,197
Min-soo, stop it.

558
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,001
Let's just leave.

559
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,392
Welcome...

560
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,989
Hello, Seh-hee.

561
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,289
Hello.

562
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,999
Your face looks natural now.

563
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,598
Is there anything uncomfortable?

564
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:54,796
No.

565
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,305
I was just passing by.

566
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,375
Do you wanna go back
to your real self?

567
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,390
Doctor!

568
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,698
Do you wanna try it?

569
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,397
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

570
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:16,883
Do you know her?

571
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,792
Doctor, can you have
a drink with me?

572
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:51,784
You know now, right?

573
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,581
About how much I love Seh-hee.

574
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:02,188
But I really can't understand her.
How could she do that?

575
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,492
Because I might dislike her...

576
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,397
how could she change the face
her parents gave her?

577
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,299
She must love you a lot.

578
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,702
But still, I can't understand her.

579
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:16,675
Doctor, you know how beautiful
Seh-hee was.

580
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,575
And natural.

581
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:21,082
You saw her real face.

582
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:22,977
I know of course.

583
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:24,881
That's why at first...

584
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,989
I showed her a dreadful surgery
on tape and tried to stop her.

585
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,489
You should have tried harder.

586
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,587
I'm sorry.

587
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,590
You think saying sorry
will fix everything now?

588
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:38,793
Is that your conscience?

589
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,700
Are you taking it out on me?

590
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,905
Why are you blaming me?

591
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,301
Think I did that for money?

592
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:48,307
What I mean is that...

593
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,277
how could you chop up
a person's face so easily?

594
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,778
Chop up?

595
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,780
Watch your mouth!

596
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,477
Whoever made her think
like that is to blame.

597
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,780
What, you bastard?

598
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:02,887
How could you tear up
a person's face?

599
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,686
Think a hospitalis
a butcher shop?

600
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,886
Was my Seh-hee a guinea pig?

601
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,589
Who the hell
do you think you are?

602
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,292
Want some surgery done
with my fist?

603
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,595
Hit me! Go ahead!

604
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:18,901
Son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch!

605
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,407
I'm a doctor!

606
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,875
I didn't buy my way
into this profession!

607
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:25,310
Watch your mouth, you bastard!

608
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,974
I can fix your face up so bad
no one can even recognize you.

609
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,177
Wanna see what chopping really is?

610
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,787
Crazy bastard.

611
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,587
Doctor, Doctor.

612
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,694
Please, wait, Doctor.

613
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:47,993
Please tell me what I can do.

614
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,000
What can I do?

615
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:54,702
Please tell me.

616
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,178
Ji-woo!

617
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,380
Ji-woo!

618
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:08,783
Ji-woo!

619
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,506
I thought I should let you know.

620
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,886
About a month has passed
after his surgery.

621
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,288
He's still probably recovering.

622
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,197
Ji-woo loves you very much.

623
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,599
He will show up before you
in five months with a different face.

624
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,671
Wait for him.

625
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,083
You've been taking
pictures of water.

626
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,379
Aren't you scared of me?

627
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,180
No, I'm not.

628
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,490
Wanna see an old picture of me?

629
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,492
No.

630
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,998
But I want to show you.

631
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,196
Then, can you show me?

632
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:49,280
I'm sorry.
I swear I had it before.

633
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,182
That's too bad.
I was a really handsome guy.

634
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,990
I hope you're happy.

635
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:06,998
If you want to see my new face,
come back here in five months.

636
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,900
Welcome.

637
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,687
May I sit here?

638
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,502
Aren't you curious about me?

639
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,004
- I am.
- About what?

640
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:02,303
About who you are.

641
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,674
Try to guess who I am.

642
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:09,977
Can I hold your hand?

643
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,287
My hand is warm, isn't it?

644
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,902
Your hand is too big.

645
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,871
Wait a sec.
Wait.

646
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:11,972
Who are you?

647
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:15,476
I must've gotten the wrong place.

648
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,081
I'm sorry.

649
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,090
Mind if I have a cup of coffee?

650
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,294
I'm sorry.

651
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:06,796
Come inside.

652
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:27,885
You took that picture at
the Sculpture Park, didn't you?

653
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,492
Yes, have you been there?

654
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:36,891
I took a picture of that sculpture
with my girlfriend before.

655
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:39,793
What's wrong?

656
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:44,696
I was thinking of old memories.

657
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,488
How does my hand feel?

658
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,390
Warm.

659
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,798
Feels like you're holding my hand?
Or your hand's being held by mine?

660
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,801
Being held by yours.

661
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:18,502
Do you think our palms
are touching or not?

662
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,208
Not touching.

663
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,175
Why?

664
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,279
You're testing something,
aren't you?

665
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,986
No, just because.

666
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,798
You look better in person.

667
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:29,969
Welcome.

668
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:08,978
May I sit here?

669
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:20,790
When was the last time you cried?

670
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,396
This morning.

671
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,594
Because of a man?

672
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,396
When was the last time you laughed?

673
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:32,901
It's been a long time.

674
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,006
Laugh for me.

675
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:39,375
Make a sound.

676
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:42,978
Louder.

677
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:01,793
How does my hand feel?

678
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:07,100
Feels like the right fit for my hand.

679
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:27,290
It's time to kiss now, right?

680
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:39,499
What was that?

681
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,884
Who's there?

682
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,084
There's too many weirdos around.

683
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,495
Wanna come to my place?

684
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,491
Come in.

685
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:15,904
Wash up first.

686
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,380
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

687
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,680
Let me go!

688
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:07,394
I haven't finished washing up.
You can't go yet.

689
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:09,190
Let me go!

690
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,491
Didn't you come to my place
for a reason?

691
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,498
Why'd you change
your mind suddenly?

692
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:15,296
You're not the man I'm looking for.

693
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:23,672
Damn it.
What's going on today?

694
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:37,478
I've been waiting for a couple of days.
I thought you wouldn't come.

695
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:39,781
How are you?

696
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,289
Fine.

697
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,893
How about my new face?

698
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,287
I like it.

699
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,497
I'd like to show you
the pictures I've taken.

700
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,505
Wanna come to my studio?

701
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:13,580
Since when have you
taken pictures of me?

702
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:14,983
Since I've met you.

703
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:16,783
Are you offended?

704
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,486
Who are you?

705
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:24,994
Is it that important who I am?

706
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,399
Who are you?

707
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,300
Who are you?

708
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:42,275
Ji-woo?

709
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:58,992
Ji-woo.

710
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:02,998
Ji-woo.

711
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,506
I'm not Ji-woo.
My name is Jung-woo.

712
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,884
Get out of my way!
You crazy bitch!

713
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,389
Damn it.

714
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:25,079
You know me, right?
It's See-hee.

715
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:26,379
Who are you?

716
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:28,281
Don't you remember?

717
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:32,285
- You know her?
- No.

718
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,487
- Who is she then?
- She just sat here.

719
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:40,296
Then why'd she talk with you?

720
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,595
I said she just sat here.

721
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:42,794
Who is she?

722
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:45,599
I don't know.
She just sat here.

723
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,402
Where are you, Ji-woo?

724
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:17,595
Ji-woo, show yourself!

725
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,301
Stop it and show yourself.

726
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:23,371
Hey!

727
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:25,172
Jung Ji-woo!

728
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,476
Where are you?
I know you're watching me!

729
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:32,484
Where are you, Ji-woo?
Why are you doing this to me?

730
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,884
All I did was love you!

731
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:38,185
Ji-woo, Ji-woo!

732
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,192
Ji-woo...

733
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:49,496
Ji-woo.

734
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:19,700
Hello?
Is this 911?

735
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:22,894
There's been an accident!
Just come!

736
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:25,198
I'm at Madu.

737
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:28,909
Just come quickly!
I said Madu station!

738
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:32,877
Damn it, someone's been hit!
Just come!

739
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:38,075
Call the cop!

740
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:51,692
- He jumped in front of me.
- Okay.

741
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:54,300
Miss, do you know him?

742
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:58,895
He just jumped in front of me.

743
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:37,169
Seh-hee!

744
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,981
Why is there blood on you?

745
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:50,685
What's wrong, Seh-hee?

746
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,498
You look tired.

747
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,987
It was wrong from the start.

748
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:37,900
Want to be totally unrecognizable?

749
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,179
Please look ahead.

750
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:52,276
Don't move.

751
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,500
I'm on my way!

752
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:57,177
I'm sorry.
I'll fix it up for you.

753
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,583
Hold on.
Wait here one sec.

754
00:49:54,128 --> 00:49:55,288
Come on in.

755
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:06,800
I'll prepare dinner first.

756
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:09,705
- Watch a DVD if you're bored.
- Okay.

757
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:13,497
Looks very delicious.

758
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,006
Wait a bit more.

759
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:34,191
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

760
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:35,693
That's great.

761
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:39,896
For a guy's place,
how come it's so clean?

762
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:42,195
Then is your place messy?

763
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:44,696
Yes.

764
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:47,307
I don't have much time to clean up.

765
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:51,209
Then I'll go and clean it for you.

766
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:53,607
Can you really?

767
00:51:54,148 --> 00:51:55,308
Yes.

768
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:05,787
It's delicious.

769
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,680
I have to go.
Thanks for dinner.

770
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:37,686
Stay the night.

771
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:39,884
Next time.

772
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:41,585
Please stay, Seh-hee.

773
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:45,093
Seh-hee?

774
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:47,494
See-hee.

775
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:49,798
Good night.

776
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,700
See-hee!

777
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:58,102
I'll go and clean your place later.

778
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:19,897
Excuse me.

779
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:35,509
Have any old pictures of yourself?
I wanna see you as a kid.

780
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,981
I don't have any.

781
00:53:37,118 --> 00:53:40,679
- Not even one?
- Yes, not even one.

782
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:42,884
That's strange.

783
00:53:56,437 --> 00:53:57,301
Show it to me.
I bet it's an old photo.

784
00:53:57,438 --> 00:53:58,598
No.

785
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,502
- Show it to me.
- No.

786
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:02,108
Can't you show it to me?

787
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:05,106
I wanna see it.

788
00:54:35,743 --> 00:54:37,108
How was it?

789
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:41,415
It was new to me.

790
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,676
It's the first time
I've felt like this.

791
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,284
Thanks.

792
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:50,583
Thanks for what?

793
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:52,787
Just everything.

794
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:55,489
For all the time that's passed.

795
00:54:57,531 --> 00:54:58,793
Do you love me?

796
00:55:01,335 --> 00:55:05,499
I don't know yet.
I just feel very happy.

797
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:22,387
Why do you keep smiling?

798
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:28,991
Because I'm happy.
You're kind and a great guy.

799
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,290
Thanks.

800
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,099
But...

801
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:34,992
Tell me.

802
00:55:37,038 --> 00:55:39,905
Did you love Seh-hee very much?

803
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:43,603
Yes.

804
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:46,908
Even now?

805
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:16,703
Why?

806
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:21,208
If Seh-hee comes back for you?

807
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:22,713
She won't come back.

808
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,080
What if she does?

809
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:57,076
That's what I want to.

810
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,081
Do I look happy?

811
00:57:05,326 --> 00:57:07,385
But I'm sad strangely.

812
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,998
My heart is gonna boom up.

813
00:57:22,443 --> 00:57:23,501
What the hell?

814
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:30,576
Did you just hit me?

815
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:32,276
Yes.

816
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,978
Why?

817
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:36,384
I love you.

818
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:43,094
Sorry, sleep again.

819
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,097
Don't hit me.
I'm gonna be angry.

820
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:30,008
To Dearest Ji-woo,

821
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:43,819
I tried to forget you but I couldn't,
I want to return to you,

822
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:45,983
Meet at the cafe on the 20th at two,
Seh-hee

823
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:43,073
Tell me.
What is it about?

824
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,687
Don't make me so curious.

825
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,690
Seh-hee is coming back.

826
00:59:54,828 --> 00:59:55,988
So?

827
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:00,393
I'm sorry.

828
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:06,302
Why are you sorry?
Are you gonna meet her?

829
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,910
I was very lonely after she left me.

830
01:00:20,321 --> 01:00:24,587
So you're meeting me
because you're lonely?

831
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:27,193
No, that's not true.

832
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:30,187
Do you still love her?

833
01:00:34,034 --> 01:00:35,296
I think so.

834
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:42,799
I can't give you up, either.

835
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,805
- I'm sorry.
- No.

836
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,106
I'll meet her and stop her.

837
01:00:47,247 --> 01:00:49,112
- You can't!
- You can't, either!

838
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:52,283
Who do you think I am?

839
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,681
Think I'm some slut
who comforts you with sex?

840
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:56,983
Watch your mouth!

841
01:00:57,124 --> 01:01:00,992
- Tell me! What am I to you?
- Get out!

842
01:01:01,628 --> 01:01:04,096
Forget when you sweated on me
like some crazy horse?

843
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:04,993
Am I a whore?

844
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:06,690
Stop it!
This is embarrassing.

845
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:08,699
Embarrassing?
You're embarrassed of me?

846
01:01:10,637 --> 01:01:12,502
Hey! Hey!

847
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:16,100
Damn it.

848
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:18,302
What are you embarrassed of?
Who made me like this?

849
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:20,606
- Is this who you are?
- Yeah!

850
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:22,215
This is me!

851
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:25,182
Kill me first before you go to her!
Kill me first before you go to her!

852
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,877
I really mistook you.

853
01:01:29,423 --> 01:01:30,583
You...

854
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:36,389
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

855
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,691
You filthy son of a bitch!

856
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:41,198
Go! Go!

857
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:13,995
The number you are calling
is not in service,

858
01:03:24,037 --> 01:03:27,404
- So what do you want?
- We're not right for each other.

859
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:30,310
I thought you were
crazy about me, fuck.

860
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:32,605
Why do you always curse?

861
01:03:32,746 --> 01:03:35,715
- I hate that.
- I'm sorry, shit.

862
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:51,392
How have you been?

863
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:53,790
I missed you so much.

864
01:03:57,638 --> 01:03:59,105
What is this?

865
01:04:02,442 --> 01:04:04,205
It was you on that island?

866
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:07,113
I wanted to see you somehow.

867
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:11,777
How could you do that?
What kind of crazy act is this?

868
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,381
I was scared of time.

869
01:04:16,623 --> 01:04:19,990
- Time that makes everything change.
- So what the hell is this?

870
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:23,189
Were you happy playing with me?

871
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:25,893
Then what the hell am I?

872
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:27,593
What am I?

873
01:04:28,635 --> 01:04:32,401
I believed if I'd changed my face
you'd love me longer.

874
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,601
But you couldn't forget...

875
01:04:35,242 --> 01:04:37,005
your girl of the past.

876
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:39,512
And I couldn't stand
being so jealous.

877
01:04:39,646 --> 01:04:42,012
That doesn't make sense.
Both of them are you!

878
01:04:42,149 --> 01:04:43,173
No.

879
01:04:43,317 --> 01:04:45,785
I'm not your woman of the past.
I'm a new woman.

880
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,087
You're crazy!

881
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:51,384
Who are you?
Who are you?

882
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:53,186
Damn it.

883
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:55,786
Think this place is
some theatrical stage?

884
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:58,989
What's with the mask?
And stop being so damn loud.

885
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:02,895
Haven't you heard of manners?

886
01:05:03,036 --> 01:05:04,799
Think this place is your home?

887
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:09,099
What the hell is this?

888
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:11,907
Why'd you fix your face?
Are you crazy?

889
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:14,104
I was too nervous.

890
01:05:15,649 --> 01:05:18,083
I thought you'd get sick of me
and find a new woman.

891
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:22,279
Think I'm some meathead
who chases after women's bodies?

892
01:05:23,123 --> 01:05:24,283
I love you.

893
01:05:27,527 --> 01:05:30,792
You're scary.
You're really scary.

894
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:34,100
Don't be like this.

895
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:37,401
Just take off my mask
and see my new face.

896
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:39,498
No.

897
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,402
You're crazy!

898
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,106
You got a problem?

899
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,607
Let's take it outside.

900
01:05:51,418 --> 01:05:52,976
Fucking bastard.

901
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,885
Min-soo.

902
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,102
Get up, asshole!

903
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:16,901
Min-soo, stop it.

904
01:06:17,044 --> 01:06:18,705
Let's just leave.

905
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,096
Welcome...

906
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:45,693
Hello, Seh-hee.

907
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:47,993
Hello.

908
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,703
Your face looks natural now.

909
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:52,302
Is there anything uncomfortable?

910
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,500
No.

911
01:07:57,644 --> 01:07:59,009
I was just passing by.

912
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:03,079
Do you wanna go back
to your real self?

913
01:08:18,832 --> 01:08:20,094
Doctor!

914
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:25,402
Do you wanna try it?

915
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:30,101
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

916
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:16,587
Do you know her?

917
01:09:28,935 --> 01:09:32,496
Doctor, can you have
a drink with me?

918
01:09:50,123 --> 01:09:51,488
You know now, right?

919
01:09:53,226 --> 01:09:55,285
About how much I love Seh-hee.

920
01:09:56,329 --> 01:10:01,892
But I really can't understand her.
How could she do that?

921
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:04,196
Because I might dislike her...

922
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:07,101
how could she change the face
her parents gave her?

923
01:10:07,741 --> 01:10:09,003
She must love you a lot.

924
01:10:09,142 --> 01:10:11,406
But still, I can't understand her.

925
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:16,379
Doctor, you know how beautiful
Seh-hee was.

926
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:18,279
And natural.

927
01:10:18,818 --> 01:10:20,786
You saw her real face.

928
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:22,681
I know of course.

929
01:10:22,822 --> 01:10:24,585
That's why at first...

930
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:27,693
I showed her a dreadful surgery
on tape and tried to stop her.

931
01:10:27,827 --> 01:10:30,193
You should have tried harder.

932
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:32,291
I'm sorry.

933
01:10:32,632 --> 01:10:35,294
You think saying sorry
will fix everything now?

934
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:38,497
Is that your conscience?

935
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,404
Are you taking it out on me?

936
01:10:42,142 --> 01:10:43,609
Why are you blaming me?

937
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:46,005
Think I did that for money?

938
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:48,011
What I mean is that...

939
01:10:48,148 --> 01:10:50,981
how could you chop up
a person's face so easily?

940
01:10:51,117 --> 01:10:52,482
Chop up?

941
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:54,484
Watch your mouth!

942
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:57,181
Whoever made her think
like that is to blame.

943
01:10:57,324 --> 01:10:58,484
What, you bastard?

944
01:10:58,825 --> 01:11:02,591
How could you tear up
a person's face?

945
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:04,390
Think a hospitalis
a butcher shop?

946
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:06,590
Was my Seh-hee a guinea pig?

947
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:09,293
Who the hell
do you think you are?

948
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:11,996
Want some surgery done
with my fist?

949
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:14,299
Hit me! Go ahead!

950
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:18,605
Son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch!

951
01:11:18,745 --> 01:11:21,111
I'm a doctor!

952
01:11:21,247 --> 01:11:23,579
I didn't buy my way
into this profession!

953
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:25,014
Watch your mouth, you bastard!

954
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:27,678
I can fix your face up so bad
no one can even recognize you.

955
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:30,881
Wanna see what chopping really is?

956
01:11:31,024 --> 01:11:32,491
Crazy bastard.

957
01:11:34,027 --> 01:11:36,291
Doctor, Doctor.

958
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,398
Please, wait, Doctor.

959
01:11:43,636 --> 01:11:47,697
Please tell me what I can do.

960
01:11:50,043 --> 01:11:51,704
What can I do?

961
01:11:53,246 --> 01:11:54,406
Please tell me.

962
01:12:02,722 --> 01:12:03,882
Ji-woo!

963
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:06,084
Ji-woo!

964
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:08,487
Ji-woo!

965
01:12:59,946 --> 01:13:02,210
I thought I should let you know.

966
01:13:11,224 --> 01:13:13,590
About a month has passed
after his surgery.

967
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:15,992
He's still probably recovering.

968
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,901
Ji-woo loves you very much.

969
01:13:31,344 --> 01:13:35,303
He will show up before you
in five months with a different face.

970
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:37,375
Wait for him.

971
01:14:11,818 --> 01:14:14,787
You've been taking
pictures of water.

972
01:14:16,422 --> 01:14:18,083
Aren't you scared of me?

973
01:14:20,326 --> 01:14:21,884
No, I'm not.

974
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:26,194
Wanna see an old picture of me?

975
01:14:27,934 --> 01:14:29,196
No.

976
01:14:30,837 --> 01:14:32,702
But I want to show you.

977
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,900
Then, can you show me?

978
01:14:45,218 --> 01:14:48,984
I'm sorry.
I swear I had it before.

979
01:14:50,723 --> 01:14:53,886
That's too bad.
I was a really handsome guy.

980
01:14:56,329 --> 01:14:57,694
I hope you're happy.

981
01:15:01,935 --> 01:15:06,702
If you want to see my new face,
come back here in five months.

982
01:17:22,342 --> 01:17:23,604
Welcome.

983
01:17:40,026 --> 01:17:41,391
May I sit here?

984
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:57,206
Aren't you curious about me?

985
01:17:58,444 --> 01:18:00,708
- I am.
- About what?

986
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:02,007
About who you are.

987
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:06,378
Try to guess who I am.

988
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,681
Can I hold your hand?

989
01:18:20,433 --> 01:18:21,991
My hand is warm, isn't it?

990
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:29,606
Your hand is too big.

991
01:18:34,947 --> 01:18:37,575
Wait a sec.
Wait.

992
01:19:10,516 --> 01:19:11,676
Who are you?

993
01:19:12,518 --> 01:19:15,180
I must've gotten the wrong place.

994
01:19:17,523 --> 01:19:18,785
I'm sorry.

995
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:57,794
Mind if I have a cup of coffee?

996
01:20:00,633 --> 01:20:01,998
I'm sorry.

997
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:06,500
Come inside.

998
01:20:23,823 --> 01:20:27,589
You took that picture at
the Sculpture Park, didn't you?

999
01:20:28,227 --> 01:20:31,196
Yes, have you been there?

1000
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:36,595
I took a picture of that sculpture
with my girlfriend before.

1001
01:20:38,337 --> 01:20:39,497
What's wrong?

1002
01:20:42,842 --> 01:20:44,400
I was thinking of old memories.

1003
01:21:03,429 --> 01:21:05,192
How does my hand feel?

1004
01:21:06,832 --> 01:21:08,094
Warm.

1005
01:21:08,634 --> 01:21:12,502
Feels like you're holding my hand?
Or your hand's being held by mine?

1006
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,505
Being held by yours.

1007
01:21:15,942 --> 01:21:18,206
Do you think our palms
are touching or not?

1008
01:21:19,445 --> 01:21:20,912
Not touching.

1009
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:27,879
Why?

1010
01:21:28,721 --> 01:21:29,983
You're testing something,
aren't you?

1011
01:21:31,324 --> 01:21:33,690
No, just because.

1012
01:21:48,341 --> 01:21:50,502
You look better in person.

1013
01:22:28,547 --> 01:22:29,673
Welcome.

1014
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,682
May I sit here?

1015
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:20,494
When was the last time you cried?

1016
01:23:22,735 --> 01:23:24,100
This morning.

1017
01:23:24,637 --> 01:23:26,298
Because of a man?

1018
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:28,100
When was the last time you laughed?

1019
01:23:31,343 --> 01:23:32,605
It's been a long time.

1020
01:23:33,345 --> 01:23:34,710
Laugh for me.

1021
01:23:37,817 --> 01:23:39,079
Make a sound.

1022
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,682
Louder.

1023
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:01,497
How does my hand feel?

1024
01:24:04,643 --> 01:24:06,804
Feels like the right fit for my hand.

1025
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:26,994
It's time to kiss now, right?

1026
01:24:38,043 --> 01:24:39,203
What was that?

1027
01:24:49,121 --> 01:24:50,588
Who's there?

1028
01:24:54,627 --> 01:24:56,788
There's too many weirdos around.

1029
01:24:59,732 --> 01:25:01,199
Wanna come to my place?

1030
01:25:03,035 --> 01:25:04,195
Come in.

1031
01:25:14,346 --> 01:25:15,608
Wash up first.

1032
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:57,084
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

1033
01:25:57,223 --> 01:25:59,384
Let me go!

1034
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:07,098
I haven't finished washing up.
You can't go yet.

1035
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:08,894
Let me go!

1036
01:26:09,034 --> 01:26:11,195
Didn't you come to my place
for a reason?

1037
01:26:11,337 --> 01:26:13,202
Why'd you change
your mind suddenly?

1038
01:26:13,339 --> 01:26:15,000
You're not the man I'm looking for.

1039
01:26:20,646 --> 01:26:23,376
Damn it.
What's going on today?

1040
01:27:34,019 --> 01:27:37,182
I've been waiting for a couple of days.
I thought you wouldn't come.

1041
01:27:38,223 --> 01:27:39,485
How are you?

1042
01:27:42,628 --> 01:27:43,993
Fine.

1043
01:27:44,129 --> 01:27:46,597
How about my new face?

1044
01:27:47,433 --> 01:27:48,991
I like it.

1045
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:58,201
I'd like to show you
the pictures I've taken.

1046
01:27:58,344 --> 01:28:00,209
Wanna come to my studio?

1047
01:28:11,623 --> 01:28:13,284
Since when have you
taken pictures of me?

1048
01:28:13,425 --> 01:28:14,687
Since I've met you.

1049
01:28:15,327 --> 01:28:16,487
Are you offended?

1050
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:19,190
Who are you?

1051
01:28:22,935 --> 01:28:24,698
Is it that important who I am?

1052
01:28:28,841 --> 01:28:30,103
Who are you?

1053
01:28:34,446 --> 01:28:36,004
Who are you?

1054
01:28:40,819 --> 01:28:41,979
Ji-woo?

1055
01:28:57,536 --> 01:28:58,696
Ji-woo.

1056
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,702
Ji-woo.

1057
01:29:05,444 --> 01:29:09,210
I'm not Ji-woo.
My name is Jung-woo.

1058
01:29:56,528 --> 01:29:59,588
Get out of my way!
You crazy bitch!

1059
01:30:00,432 --> 01:30:02,093
Damn it.

1060
01:30:22,121 --> 01:30:24,783
You know me, right?
It's See-hee.

1061
01:30:24,923 --> 01:30:26,083
Who are you?

1062
01:30:26,825 --> 01:30:27,985
Don't you remember?

1063
01:30:29,828 --> 01:30:31,989
- You know her?
- No.

1064
01:30:32,631 --> 01:30:35,191
- Who is she then?
- She just sat here.

1065
01:30:38,237 --> 01:30:40,000
Then why'd she talk with you?

1066
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:41,299
I said she just sat here.

1067
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,498
Who is she?

1068
01:30:42,641 --> 01:30:45,303
I don't know.
She just sat here.

1069
01:31:13,639 --> 01:31:15,106
Where are you, Ji-woo?

1070
01:31:15,741 --> 01:31:17,299
Ji-woo, show yourself!

1071
01:31:19,344 --> 01:31:21,005
Stop it and show yourself.

1072
01:31:21,847 --> 01:31:23,075
Hey!

1073
01:31:23,215 --> 01:31:24,876
Jung Ji-woo!

1074
01:31:25,017 --> 01:31:28,180
Where are you?
I know you're watching me!

1075
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,188
Where are you, Ji-woo?
Why are you doing this to me?

1076
01:31:32,324 --> 01:31:34,588
All I did was love you!

1077
01:31:35,227 --> 01:31:37,889
Ji-woo, Ji-woo!

1078
01:31:39,031 --> 01:31:40,896
Ji-woo...

1079
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,200
Ji-woo.

1080
01:32:16,435 --> 01:32:19,404
Hello?
Is this 911?

1081
01:32:19,538 --> 01:32:22,598
There's been an accident!
Just come!

1082
01:32:22,741 --> 01:32:24,902
I'm at Madu.

1083
01:32:25,644 --> 01:32:28,613
Just come quickly!
I said Madu station!

1084
01:32:28,747 --> 01:32:32,581
Damn it, someone's been hit!
Just come!

1085
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:37,779
Call the cop!

1086
01:32:49,735 --> 01:32:51,396
- He jumped in front of me.
- Okay.

1087
01:32:51,536 --> 01:32:54,004
Miss, do you know him?

1088
01:32:54,139 --> 01:32:58,599
He just jumped in front of me.

1089
01:33:35,747 --> 01:33:36,873
Seh-hee!

1090
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,685
Why is there blood on you?

1091
01:33:49,127 --> 01:33:50,389
What's wrong, Seh-hee?

1092
01:34:05,644 --> 01:34:07,202
You look tired.

1093
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,691
It was wrong from the start.

1094
01:34:35,841 --> 01:34:37,604
Want to be totally unrecognizable?

1095
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,883
Please look ahead.

1096
01:34:50,422 --> 01:34:51,980
Don't move.

1097
01:35:44,543 --> 01:35:46,204
I'm on my way!

1098
01:35:54,219 --> 01:35:56,881
I'm sorry.
I'll fix it up for you.

1099
01:35:58,023 --> 01:36:00,287
Hold on.
Wait here one sec.
