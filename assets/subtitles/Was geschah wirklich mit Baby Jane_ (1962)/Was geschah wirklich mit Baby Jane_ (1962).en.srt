1
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:11,847
Want to see it again, little girl?
It shouldn't frighten you.

2
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:33,807
I'm sorry. Nothing until
matinee tomorrow.

3
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:46,822
Lady,
would ya mind takin' off your hat?

4
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:48,085
Excuse me.

5
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:02,472
Atta girl, Janey. Show 'em how!

6
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,234
Oh, thank you, folks.
Thank you very much, thank you...

7
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:36,233
One final request, all right?

8
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,676
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy!"

9
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:48,545
All right, thank you.

10
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:51,288
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy. "

11
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:14,836
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

12
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:21,180
"His address is heaven above.

13
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,852
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

14
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:34,190
"... and wish you were with us to love.

15
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:39,868
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.

16
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:47,207
"The postman says that's best to do.

17
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:52,643
"I've written this letter to Daddy...

18
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:59,224
"... saying, I love you.

19
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:26,743
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

20
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:34,257
"... saying, I love you!"

21
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,476
Well, what do you have here?

22
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:55,504
All for you.

23
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,011
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?

24
00:03:58,283 --> 00:04:00,114
Thank you, young man,
that's a gorgeous doll!

25
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,446
Folks, have you ever seen
such a lovely doll?

26
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,561
Don't forget, there's a genuine...

27
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:20,503
...Baby Jane doll waiting for each and
every one of you right out in the foyer.

28
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,573
All you have to do is go out there
and collect it. And kids, remember...

29
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:26,539
...you can tell your moms that
each and everyone of these...

30
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,871
...genuine, beautiful, great
big dolls...

31
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:33,311
...is an exact replica of your own
Baby Jane Hudson.

32
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:39,552
Baby Jane dolls.
Only $3.25.

33
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,800
I won't, I don't wanna
go back to that ol' hotel!

34
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:59,735
I don't have to take a nap
and you can't make me!

35
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,369
Now, Jane, don't act up, sweetheart.

36
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,209
You've got to take your nap.
You know that.

37
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,749
No, I don't know and I'm not going to!

38
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,844
You don't want all these
nice friends of yours out here...

39
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,045
...to think that you're
a bad little girl, do ya?

40
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:14,114
I don't care! I want an ice cream!

41
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,456
Janey, I told you...

42
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:19,656
I make the money,
so I can have what I want!

43
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,928
Leave me alone! I need an ice cream!

44
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,560
Well, if you need an ice cream...

45
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,562
...I guess you better have some.

46
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,470
I mean, it's pretty hot and all.

47
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,939
But remember, this is
the last time this week.

48
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:37,313
All right, Daddy.
Blanche wants some, too.

49
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:39,379
We gotta have some
ice cream for Blanche.

50
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,620
I don't want anything.

51
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:45,751
What do you think you're tryin' to do?!

52
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:48,651
I always said it's the parents' fault
in cases like this.

53
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,652
I'm really disappointed!

54
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,663
It sure is a hot day today.

55
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,270
You're the lucky one, though,
Blanche, really you are.

56
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:13,415
Someday it's going to be you
that's getting all the attention.

57
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:15,176
And when that happens, I...

58
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:19,521
...I want you to try to be kinder
to Jane and your father...

59
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:21,559
...than they are to you now.

60
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:25,219
You know what I mean?

61
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:31,395
I hope you'll try'n remember that.

62
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,268
I won't forget.

63
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,937
You bet I won't forget!

64
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:45,605
The Seltzer Agency sent you?

65
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:48,415
Think there's any chance for me?

66
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:51,046
There's a chance if Mr. Weber likes you.

67
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:53,420
What type does he like?

68
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:56,926
A lot of personality.

69
00:06:57,896 --> 00:07:00,364
I'll catch on, watch me.

70
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,869
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

71
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,741
With my money
I should make a picture like that, huh?

72
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:16,309
Good morning, Mr. Weber.
I'm Ms. Brent.

73
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,645
Yes. Won't you come a little closer,
please?

74
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,742
She's got a southern accent
like I got a southern accent.

75
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,888
I know it's 11:00!
I'll be there when I get there!

76
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,523
Gardner is here to see you.

77
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,692
Gardner?

78
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:38,827
I'll come out.

79
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,531
I'll be right back, Ms. Brent.

80
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:43,403
Have yourself a cigarette.

81
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:44,533
Make yourself at home.

82
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:46,201
Then the job is mine?

83
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:47,806
Need you ask?

84
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,974
Kill it!

85
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,654
What do you think, Ben?

86
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,656
What's thinking got to do with it, huh?

87
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:38,653
She stinks, doesn't she?

88
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:42,694
They say the end's pretty good.
Maybe we should've seen it through.

89
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,062
You gonna want that picture
again today, Mr. Feldman?

90
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:53,135
I don't think anybody's ever gonna want
that picture again!

91
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:02,179
When the old man hired them
Hudson sisters...

92
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,979
...how come he had to hire
the back end of the act, too?

93
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,817
Boy, what a no-talent broad
that Baby Jane is!

94
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,391
Why can't she stay sober?

95
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:14,889
Jane's got her pride.
She's a very sensitive girl.

96
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,727
Your "very sensitive girl" guzzled
her way through six cases of Scotch...

97
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,460
...and slugged two studio cops.

98
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:23,905
Not to mention one or two other
less savory items of publicity...

99
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:26,201
...before we got that so-called
epic in the can.

100
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:28,139
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.

101
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,744
If Blanche will only let us out
of that clause in the contract...

102
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:33,113
...which says that we have to make
a picture with Baby Jane...

103
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:34,981
...for every picture that we make
with Blanche.

104
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:37,214
Then Baby Jane's contract
won't be any problem.

105
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,354
You see, that's what we pay lawyers for.

106
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,355
Possibly.

107
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:43,755
But somehow,
I can't see Blanche doing that.

108
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,052
You know, I don't get it!

109
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,064
Blanche Hudson's the biggest thing
in movies today.

110
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:49,732
She can write her own ticket.
She's got a script approval.

111
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:52,402
She's got more money than she knows
what to do with...

112
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:57,434
You know, she just bought that
tremendous place Valentino used to have.

113
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,908
It's gonna take her a year
to fix it up...

114
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:01,477
...the way she wants it
before they move in.

115
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,046
Well I guess they can manage
to struggle on where they are now.

116
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,311
But, my point is she ought to have
sense enough to know that...

117
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:11,082
...she can't make a star
out of Baby Jane again.

118
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:14,282
Blanche doesn't have
any illusions like that.

119
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:18,154
But she's a very fine person, Ben.

120
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,624
She's never gonna forget
those early years.

121
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,924
What her sister did for her.
She told me that herself.

122
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:26,960
Well, I tell you, she's not doin'
Baby Jane any favor.

123
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:30,140
Someday, sooner or later,
that girl's gonna end up in a home.

124
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,876
Look, you're going to their party
at the Grove tonight, aren't you?

125
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,779
Did you ever try refusing
one of Blanche's invitations?

126
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,416
Do me a favor, Marty, will ya?
You talk to Blanche.

127
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:43,712
Try to make her understand, huh?

128
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:46,117
- Do my best.
- Thanks...

129
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:50,224
Remind me to send you
one of those...

130
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,661
...Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.

131
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:55,790
I've got mine for this year.

132
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,569
I don't get it, Marty.

133
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:02,301
What do they make monsters
like this for?

134
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,337
For Blanche Hudson.

135
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:10,207
That's our problem.

136
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,071
You go to bed!

137
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,446
- Hi, Mom!
- Oh, hi, dear.

138
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:26,733
Hello, beautiful!
How 'bout a little souvenir?

139
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:28,135
Let go of that, will ya, let go!

140
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,971
Come on, don't be like that.
Who do you think you are?

141
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:35,401
Thanks.

142
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:44,020
Isn't she great?

143
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:48,589
Sorry to break in on this fine old
Blanche Hudson movie, folks.

144
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,384
But you'll be glad I did...

145
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:52,156
...when you see what I have
right here...

146
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,460
...for that favorite pooch of yours.

147
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,090
And lliad means quality.

148
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:00,433
So when your dog says, "woof woof"...

149
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,336
...feed him lliad,
the classic dog food.

150
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:03,634
Oh, shut up!

151
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,802
Lliad will bring the sheen
back to your dog's coat...

152
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,971
Oh, my goodness, I remember
the first time I saw that picture.

153
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:11,545
I thought it was just wonderful.

154
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:12,913
When was that?

155
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:17,649
Let's see now, as I recall, your father
took me to see it at the old Majestic.

156
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,822
It was before we were married.

157
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:23,618
She must be about 150 by now!

158
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,222
As a matter of fact, dear,
I think Blanche Hudson is...

159
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:28,993
...just a few years older than I am.

160
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:30,598
Really?!

161
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:32,795
Yes, dear, "really. "

162
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,403
Well, how come
we never see her around?

163
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:38,331
We've been living next door to them
for six months now...

164
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:41,875
...and the only one I ever see
is that fat sister slouching around.

165
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,081
Don't they ever have company?

166
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:45,714
I mean it must be awful.

167
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,250
You know, Julie says
that sister's kind of peculiar.

168
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:51,919
Did you ever notice that?

169
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:53,748
No, I never have.

170
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:56,082
Well, that's what Julie told me.

171
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,788
She said that she was supposed
to be responsible for the accident...

172
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:01,226
...that crippled her sister Blanche.

173
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:04,400
That all happened
a very long time ago, dear.

174
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:06,163
And maybe you shouldn't
pay too much attention...

175
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:07,602
...to everything that Julie Fowler
tells you.

176
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:10,402
There's too many people in this town
with nothing else to do but talk.

177
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:13,735
Maybe so, but Julie's folks
have lived here a long time.

178
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:15,468
I guess she should know.

179
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,510
Turn up the volume, dear.
We're missing the picture.

180
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:22,682
- Will you have a little champagne?
- No, thank you.

181
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:27,886
You wanna tell Poppa your troubles?

182
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,691
Somebody you love?

183
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:34,554
Oh, Jack, please try to understand.

184
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:36,390
I married you because...

185
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,864
...I was knocked silly
and it was a refuge.

186
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:45,097
I found out tonight that this boy's
in trouble, maybe alone.

187
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,507
It's blinding me.

188
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:49,843
I can't think of anything else...

189
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,776
Oh! He should've held that shot...

190
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:54,909
...longer.

191
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:58,915
I told him that when we were rehearsing,
also when it was shot!

192
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,316
But he wouldn't listen!

193
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:09,863
- Hiya?
- Swell.

194
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:14,102
It's still a pretty good picture.

195
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,468
...and Gemini...

196
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:01,348
Tommy, you don't have to stay here,
do you?

197
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,750
I'll just sit here.

198
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:08,518
Enjoying yourself?

199
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,021
Jane, what are you doing?

200
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:14,128
I was watching!

201
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:16,523
Then you're an idiot!

202
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,864
I won't have you speak to me like that!

203
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:31,011
Ah, the poor thing!

204
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,882
Poor baby.

205
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:39,719
Quiet down.

206
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,808
Oh, good morning, Ms. Hudson.
I hope I'm not intruding.

207
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,650
I just couldn't resist cutting
these flowers for your sister...

208
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,080
...after seeing her show yesterday.

209
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:14,387
You must be very proud
of her new success...

210
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,523
...on television, I mean.

211
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,754
I can't tell you how nice it is...

212
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:23,322
...to be seeing all of
her old pictures like this.

213
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,392
I'll tell 'er you said so.

214
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:31,100
You know, my daughter and I
would just love to meet her one day.

215
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:32,199
Perhaps she could...

216
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:34,574
Mrs. Bates,
my sister doesn't ever go out.

217
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:37,808
She's not fit to receive visitors.

218
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:40,579
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

219
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,212
I'd no idea that, well...

220
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,690
I hope she likes the flowers.

221
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,929
Thanks.

222
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:20,316
You miserable...

223
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,133
Oh, Jane, I'm sorry.

224
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,392
I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.

225
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:08,363
I was just wondering who all those
people were at the back door.

226
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:10,636
Wasn't anything.

227
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,504
Just that nosey Mrs. Bates going on
about your picture last night.

228
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:17,576
Oh, really? Did she like it?

229
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,843
Oh, really? Did she like it?

230
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:25,154
She liked it.

231
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:29,883
I remember, when it first came out...

232
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:32,595
...it had a tremendous reception.

233
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:36,859
The critics described it as... brilliant!

234
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:40,661
Do you remember what year
you made that picture?

235
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:45,335
Well, of course, you must, too.
In 1934, right after I did "Moonglow. "

236
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,344
I made a picture that year, too!

237
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:53,077
Oh, yes, it was that comedy
directed by Lloyd, wasn't it?

238
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:55,876
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.

239
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,451
"The Longest Night. "

240
00:22:57,788 --> 00:22:59,983
Marty McDonald said
it was the best thing I ever did!

241
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,719
They never even released it
in the United States!

242
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:07,460
Feldman was very upset.

243
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,055
He told me the company had...

244
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,930
...a very bad year and
they couldn't afford...

245
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:12,127
No, they didn't!
They had a great year!

246
00:23:12,202 --> 00:23:13,897
They didn't want to show my films.

247
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:16,835
They were too busy
giving a "big build-up"...

248
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:19,565
...to that crap you were turning out.

249
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,606
I'll clean the cage.

250
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:29,817
Oh, that would be Elvira.

251
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:05,079
Come in, Elvira!

252
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:09,488
- How are you today?
- Fine.

253
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:12,056
Oh, you've seen Jane.

254
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:16,357
I don't think she's feeling
very well today.

255
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,001
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby
about Ms. Jane like you said?

256
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:23,506
No, I haven't yet.
It's rather difficult.

257
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:26,165
I don't want to upset her again,
if I can help it.

258
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:28,274
But she'll be upset anyway,
Ms. Blanche.

259
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:31,379
And the longer you leave it,
the worse it's gonna be.

260
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:33,173
I know.

261
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:37,119
But I was just hoping
it wouldn't be necessary.

262
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:40,114
I think she seems much better lately.

263
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:41,790
It's none of my business...

264
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:44,293
...but she's been drinkin' again.
You know that, don't ya?

265
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:46,463
No, I hadn't noticed.

266
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:50,657
Oh, I don't think
it does her any real harm.

267
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:52,893
I think I understand her.

268
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,296
Oh, you do, huh?

269
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:56,699
Well, then, you ought
to take a look at this.

270
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:02,336
What are these?

271
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,447
I guess it's what you'd call fan mail.

272
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,049
Oh, how kind people are.

273
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:11,948
You better look at them...

274
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:15,423
...and then you can tell me
whether or not you've seen them before.

275
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,386
- Did you read that?
- No.

276
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:19,690
But they've been opened.

277
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:21,424
That's right, they all have.

278
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:24,463
And there's one in here
marked "Personal. "

279
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:35,043
"The other night my husband and I
watched that lovely movie of yours...

280
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:36,437
"... 'Last Honeymoon. '

281
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:39,673
"I remember saying to my husband
at the time that seeing you again...

282
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,945
"... was just like
meeting an old friend. "

283
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:46,420
Oh, that's charming.
That's really charming!

284
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,318
The point is, you never
saw them before, did you?

285
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,792
I thought not.

286
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:58,532
I'm sorry, I thought you ought to know.

287
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:01,934
But, I don't understand.

288
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:04,370
Where'd they come from?
Where'd you find them?

289
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,541
In the trash barrel, that's where!

290
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:08,301
They're from that television station...

291
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:10,369
...that's been running
your old movies, aren't they?

292
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:20,756
You mean Jane?

293
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,990
Who else?

294
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:26,695
Oh, well, she must have thought
they were advertisements.

295
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:29,161
Then why would she open
the one marked "Personal"?

296
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:32,391
And what about this?
You might as well see this, too.

297
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:35,965
Writing those dirty words!

298
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:40,471
I can even remember the last time
I saw words like that written down!

299
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,102
But, why would she do a thing like this?

300
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,573
You know what makes her
do things like this!

301
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:49,013
She's sick, and she's not
getting any better.

302
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:52,052
In fact, the last month
she's been getting a lot worse.

303
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,592
If you don't believe me, then...

304
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:59,628
...why are you selling this house
and planning to move out?

305
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:01,954
You said this last month...

306
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,394
...she's been a lot worse.

307
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:06,466
Do you think she knows?

308
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,136
About selling the house?

309
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:12,064
How could she?
You don't have anything in writing.

310
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:14,735
We're sisters, Elvira.

311
00:27:15,345 --> 00:27:16,972
We know each other very well.

312
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:18,105
I think she's jealous...

313
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:22,084
...because of those old movies of yours
they're showing on television this week.

314
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:24,952
Anyway, in six weeks you'll have to
hand over the house and then...

315
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:26,917
...she'll have to know.

316
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:29,786
How do I tell her?

317
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:30,721
How?!

318
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:35,925
Well, if you'd just speak to that
Dr. Shelby, maybe he could tell her.

319
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,699
No, it ought to be me.

320
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:48,207
I can't let a stranger tell her.

321
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:52,039
But he's a doctor, Ms. Blanche.
And she's a sick woman.

322
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:56,979
Elvira, you didn't know her
when she was a child.

323
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:58,721
When she was young.

324
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:01,722
I've seen those pictures she keeps.

325
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,518
It wasn't that she was just pretty.

326
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:09,128
She was different.

327
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,928
She was so alive.

328
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:19,569
I was cleaning the cage.

329
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:21,506
The bird got out.

330
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:24,244
But where is it now?

331
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:26,612
It flew out the window.

332
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:30,313
You let that bird out
on purpose, Ms. Jane!

333
00:28:30,654 --> 00:28:35,489
I just told ya, I was cleaning the cage
and the bird flew out the window.

334
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:38,856
I'm sorry!

335
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:43,723
She did that on purpose!
Believe me, she did it on purpose!

336
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,298
Never mind.

337
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,526
Maybe he'll come back.

338
00:29:02,252 --> 00:29:03,913
You won't change your mind, will you?

339
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:05,682
I mean about coming to live with me?

340
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:08,223
You know I don't go back
on my word, Ms. Blanche.

341
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:11,552
But you've got to make up your mind
about finding somewhere for Ms. Jane...

342
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:14,228
...where they can
look after her properly.

343
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,602
I have made up my mind.

344
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:22,603
I'm going to call Dr. Shelby today.

345
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:34,974
I know, Ms. Blanche, I know.

346
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:40,180
It's just that I have to be sure...

347
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:42,157
...I'm doing the right thing for her.

348
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:10,352
Hello, is this Johnson's?

349
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:13,745
I want to order some liquor.
It's Jane Hudson.

350
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:19,259
Waddaya mean you can't fill
any more orders for me?

351
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:21,826
My sister did?

352
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:31,767
Well, wait a minute,
I'll put 'er on.

353
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:38,513
Blanche, would you speak
to this man from Johnson's?

354
00:30:44,154 --> 00:30:46,782
Hello, who is this, please?

355
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:52,022
Oh, yes, Mr. Carlston.

356
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:54,996
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson.
What seems to be the trouble?

357
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:02,801
I'm afraid there's been some
misunderstanding.

358
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:04,902
I certainly didn't mean to suggest...

359
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:08,076
...that you shouldn't fill
any orders for her.

360
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,781
After all, we do pay
our bills, don't we?

361
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,818
Yes, fine.

362
00:31:19,756 --> 00:31:20,745
Would you please?

363
00:31:23,727 --> 00:31:25,695
I'll put her on.

364
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:32,995
Okay, then?

365
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,629
Good...

366
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:39,164
...I'd like to order six bottles
of Scotch and three bottles of gin.

367
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,710
The same brands,
and as soon as possible.

368
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:57,491
I just told Ms. Blanche. I'm going
downtown to see a man about jury duty.

369
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,663
I'll be back tomorrow.

370
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:22,210
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

371
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:28,379
"His address is heaven above.

372
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:35,920
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

373
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:43,490
"... and wish you were with us to love.

374
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:49,304
"Instead of a stamp, I put kisses.

375
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:53,937
"The postman says...

376
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:14,458
"The postman says...

377
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:16,260
"... that's best to do.

378
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:23,538
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

379
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,771
"... saying, 'I...

380
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,011
"... love... you. "'

381
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:56,800
"Now when I'm very good...

382
00:34:56,973 --> 00:35:00,465
"... And do as I am told...

383
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:02,535
"... I'm Mama's little angel.

384
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:07,243
"And Papa says I'm good as gold.

385
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:09,080
"But when I'm very bad...

386
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:12,583
"... and answer back and sass...

387
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:14,881
"... then I'm Mama's little devil.

388
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:18,628
"And Papa says I've got the brass.

389
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:23,359
"Now I wish that you would tell me...

390
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:27,727
"... 'cause I'm much too young
to know... "

391
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,205
All right, Blanche Hudson!

392
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,419
Ms. Big, Fat, Movie Star!

393
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,812
Ms. Rotten, Stinking Actress!

394
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,717
Press a button, ring a bell...

395
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:26,156
...and you think the whole damn world
comes running, don't you?!

396
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:30,125
Lunch, Ms. Hudson?

397
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,731
Why, certainly, Ms. Hudson!

398
00:36:34,037 --> 00:36:38,667
I'm sure we can find something
appropriate for you, Ms. Hudson!

399
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:18,374
Oh, you brought my lunch.
A bit early, isn't it?

400
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:20,048
Then what were you ringing for?

401
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,783
Oh, I wanted to tell you,
something's wrong with the telephone.

402
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,954
Maybe it's been left off
the hook downstairs.

403
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:27,819
Is that so?

404
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:30,121
Who'd you wanna call, Blanche?

405
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:34,227
Well, actually I wanted
to call Bert Hanley.

406
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:37,729
Oh, our business manager?

407
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:44,196
There's something I've been
meaning to discuss with you.

408
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:54,846
Well, I'm afraid I have bad news...
about money.

409
00:37:55,585 --> 00:38:00,079
You see the point is, Bert thinks
we'll probably have to sell the house.

410
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:04,755
Why should we have to
sell the house, Blanche?

411
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:09,930
Well, that's what I'm trying
to tell you.

412
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:13,458
Our financial position
is such that we just...

413
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:14,998
...we can't afford to...

414
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:17,136
We've got plenty of
money invested. I know.

415
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:20,169
Yes... yes, that's quite true, but...

416
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:23,669
...some of those investments
aren't paying much.

417
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:30,017
When did our business manager
tell you all this?

418
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:32,788
Early last week, I think.

419
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,954
He didn't call here last week.
I know that, too.

420
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:41,525
No, we didn't actually speak
on the telephone.

421
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:42,753
He wrote me a letter.

422
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:44,561
He didn't write you any letter either.

423
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,131
There hasn't been a letter
from his office since...

424
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:47,191
Yes, Jane, there has.

425
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,433
Oh, you're a liar! You're just a liar!
You always were!

426
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:54,942
Bert Hanley never wrote you any letter
and never called you on the phone...

427
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,769
...tellin' you to sell the house.

428
00:38:57,013 --> 00:39:00,380
You called him four weeks ago
and told him to sell it!

429
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:04,812
I did nothing of the sort.

430
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:09,524
Don't you think I know everything
that goes on in this house?

431
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:14,760
You've been spying on me!

432
00:39:16,432 --> 00:39:18,229
What do you think?!

433
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:20,426
You are disgusting!

434
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:23,396
After all I've done for you!

435
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:25,264
When all I'm trying to do is help.

436
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:27,605
Who are you tryin' to help, Blanche?

437
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:30,807
What were you plannin' to do with me
when you sold the house?

438
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:32,571
What'd you have in mind...

439
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:35,716
...some nice little place
where they could look after me?

440
00:39:47,897 --> 00:39:51,424
Better not tire yourself out
using the phone anymore.

441
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:55,162
If there are any calls,
I'll take them downstairs.

442
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:01,303
Eat your lunch, it'll get cold!

443
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:30,397
Jane! Please wait.

444
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:38,799
Jane, I want to talk to you... please!

445
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,899
Jane, I want to talk to...

446
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:16,336
Telephone, mother.

447
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:18,606
All right, dear.

448
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:19,092
I called this morning and placed an ad.

449
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,029
Did we give you a reference number?

450
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:21,933
Oh, yeah.

451
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:35,307
Here it is.
You want to check the copy?

452
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:42,149
That's fine.

453
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,655
Did you want this to go in the
"Personal" column or in the want ads?

454
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,590
Well, I always think the "Personal"
column's nicer, don't you.

455
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:54,970
That's an eight-line ad.
That'll be $6.30.

456
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:05,274
Who's placing this ad?

457
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:07,906
We have to know.

458
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:09,484
Why, I am!

459
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,620
Yeah, I know, but who for?

460
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:14,753
You see, when you're placing
an advertisement for someone...

461
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:17,258
...to do a job for you, we have to
have your name for the record.

462
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:20,324
Well, my name is... Jane Hudson.

463
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,494
Maybe you remember me.
I'm Baby Jane Hudson!

464
00:45:31,507 --> 00:45:32,303
Sure.

465
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:35,844
Thank you. This will be
in the paper tomorrow.

466
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:43,351
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson?

467
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:49,088
"Please call Dr. Shelby
at OL6-1656 and...

468
00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:51,885
"... ask him to come
to the house immediately. "

469
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,195
"Under no circumstances...

470
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,040
"... let my sister...

471
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:15,977
"... see the contents...

472
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:20,316
"... of this note.

473
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,322
"... Blanche Hudson. "

474
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:34,390
Oh, Ms. Hudson, how nice to see you.

475
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,960
- I was just going to call on you.
- Why?

476
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:40,034
I just wanted to ask you about the
flowers I brought over for your sister.

477
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:42,533
I'm afraid they don't last very long
this time of year and...

478
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:44,865
...I thought perhaps
you'd like some more.

479
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,570
You could've saved yourself
the trouble.

480
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:50,077
Oh, but it's no trouble at all.

481
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:52,910
I've just been cutting some,
that's why I came over.

482
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:54,774
I always think it's so nice
to have flowers...

483
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,249
...in the house...
- Mrs. Bates!

484
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:59,653
I guess if my sister needed flowers,
we could afford to buy them!

485
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:47,096
What's the matter, Mother? You look
as though you've been in a fight.

486
00:48:47,336 --> 00:48:49,201
I'm not sure that I haven't been.

487
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:52,669
Jane Hudson makes me so mad,
I could kill her!

488
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:55,341
That's a good idea.

489
00:48:55,711 --> 00:48:57,201
What'll we use?

490
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,538
Did you have a nice drive?

491
00:49:57,373 --> 00:49:58,772
What are you talking about?

492
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,771
Nothing, dear. It's been so long
since you were out of the house.

493
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:04,569
I though perhaps you'd gone
for a drive or something.

494
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:06,506
You know, I was thinking...

495
00:50:07,683 --> 00:50:10,811
...it's been so long since
we had a talk...

496
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:14,385
...you know, a real talk
about the future and everything.

497
00:50:18,894 --> 00:50:21,260
I didn't want you to be worried
about the house.

498
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,465
Even if I do have to sell it,
we'll still be together.

499
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:27,201
Blanche, you're not going
to sell this house.

500
00:50:28,604 --> 00:50:30,504
Daddy bought this house.

501
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:32,398
And he bought it for me.

502
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:37,009
You don't think I remember that,
do you?

503
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,914
You're wrong, Jane.

504
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:41,506
You've just forgotten.

505
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:44,342
I bought this house for the two of us...

506
00:50:44,587 --> 00:50:46,111
...when I signed my first contract.

507
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:48,849
You don't think I remember anything,
do you?

508
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:51,723
There're a whole lot of things
I remember.

509
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:54,088
And you never paid for this house.

510
00:50:54,997 --> 00:50:59,297
Baby Jane paid for this house,
that's who!

511
00:50:59,635 --> 00:51:01,694
You don't know what you're saying.

512
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:08,675
You aren't ever gonna
sell this house.

513
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:11,569
And you aren't ever
gonna leave it...

514
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:14,347
...either.

515
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,122
Do you remember when
I first came back after the accident?

516
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:39,536
You promised you wouldn't ever
talk about that again.

517
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:41,036
I know I did...

518
00:51:41,844 --> 00:51:43,869
...but I'm still in this chair.

519
00:51:44,113 --> 00:51:47,207
After all those years
I'm still in this chair.

520
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:50,543
Doesn't that give you
some kind of responsibility?

521
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:54,147
Jane, I'm just trying to explain
to you how things really are.

522
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:56,848
You wouldn't be able to do
these awful things to me...

523
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,086
...if I weren't still in this chair!

524
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:07,828
But you are, Blanche!
You are in that chair!

525
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:13,538
And tell me what are these awful things
I'm supposed to be doing to you?

526
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:17,809
Well I meant...

527
00:52:18,814 --> 00:52:21,305
...you wouldn't have to work so hard.

528
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:24,215
And I was thinking maybe...

529
00:52:24,286 --> 00:52:26,948
...maybe Elvira could come in
more often.

530
00:52:27,556 --> 00:52:29,786
Maybe she could even live with us.

531
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:32,990
We don't need Elvira!

532
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:36,588
But you get so tired, you...

533
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,090
There's so much to do,
and you're not well.

534
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:42,594
Maybe you're right.

535
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:46,704
Maybe I should get
a check-up or something.

536
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:50,136
That would be wonderful!

537
00:52:51,413 --> 00:52:55,372
Perhaps we can, we can find
a really good doctor.

538
00:52:56,218 --> 00:53:00,154
We could get hold of that
nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we?

539
00:53:01,757 --> 00:53:03,418
Let's see...

540
00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:06,250
...what's his number again?

541
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:18,672
"... Under no circumstances...

542
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:23,271
"... tell my sister the contents
of this note. "

543
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,578
It's not me that needs
a doctor, Blanche!

544
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:31,305
Hello, lovey.

545
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:34,402
Now, don't stop for me.

546
00:55:34,643 --> 00:55:36,304
What did the doctor say?

547
00:55:37,446 --> 00:55:42,179
He says it's no use my trying
to go back to work for six months.

548
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:44,351
Didn't he even give you
anything new to take?

549
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,884
Oh, he says it's arthritis.

550
00:55:47,155 --> 00:55:51,489
An' the only thing for me to do is
not to try an' work until it clears up.

551
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,355
Did he suggest what we're going
to use for money in the meantime?

552
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:59,701
No, dear.
But he's ever such a nice man.

553
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,604
Now, lovey, never you mind, anyway.

554
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:08,270
You know, we've still got
a bit of savings.

555
00:56:08,644 --> 00:56:11,044
You're my little worrier.

556
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:15,216
That's nice.
You've found something, have you?

557
00:56:15,484 --> 00:56:19,113
You don't have to get so excited.
You haven't even seen what it is yet.

558
00:56:20,022 --> 00:56:22,252
No, dear but it's a possibility,
isn't it?

559
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:25,425
I mean, there aren't that many jobs
that'd be suitable...

560
00:56:25,694 --> 00:56:28,492
...I mean for someone
with your qualifications.

561
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:31,892
What qualifications?

562
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:35,836
Well, you know... serious music
and that...

563
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:39,939
Oh, this sounds like
just the ticket, doesn't it?

564
00:56:43,745 --> 00:56:46,145
- You're gonna call?
- Call who?

565
00:56:46,915 --> 00:56:48,507
These people.

566
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,247
Might as well.

567
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:51,410
Now?

568
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:56,147
Well, it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use
calling next week, would it?

569
00:57:01,496 --> 00:57:05,159
Mom, tell you what.
Why don't you call for me?

570
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:07,866
Tell them you're my secretary
or something.

571
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,336
All right, dear, I'll do that.

572
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,804
And listen, I won't let on who I am.

573
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:18,069
You see, I'll just tell 'em
I'm Mr. Flagg's "secketary. "

574
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:21,942
- Secretary.
- Sec-re-tary.

575
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:25,779
Well, do you know...

576
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:27,955
...I do believe yer old mum'd...

577
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,353
...be a jolly good "secketary" at that.

578
00:57:32,394 --> 00:57:34,726
Don't you think?

579
00:57:51,013 --> 00:57:52,776
This is Jane Hudson.

580
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:56,876
Oh, about the ad!

581
00:57:58,687 --> 00:57:59,745
Who is this?

582
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:03,023
This is Mr. Flagg's "secketary. "

583
00:58:03,825 --> 00:58:05,816
Oh, his secretary.

584
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:09,488
Mr. Flagg is very interested.

585
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:12,063
And he'd like to know if
he can have an appointment.

586
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:16,428
I think you'll find
he's very well qualified.

587
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:20,231
Well, sure, I'd be glad to give
Mr. Flagg an appointment.

588
00:58:21,243 --> 00:58:23,177
Well, now, let me see...

589
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:25,440
...how 'bout 4:00 this afternoon?

590
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:31,010
I think that would be fine.

591
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:34,478
Well, I'll be expecting him then.

592
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:45,261
It's all fixed, lovey.

593
00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:49,630
Ah, yer old mum's managed everything...

594
00:58:50,272 --> 00:58:51,762
...hasn't she?

595
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,174
Oh, shut up!

596
00:59:12,027 --> 00:59:13,289
What do you want this time?

597
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:14,857
Who was on the telephone?

598
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:17,292
None of your business!
What were you ringing for?

599
00:59:17,566 --> 00:59:18,590
I'm hungry, Jane.

600
00:59:18,867 --> 00:59:20,698
Well, of course you're hungry.
You didn't eat your dinner.

601
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:22,066
That's why you're hungry.

602
00:59:23,305 --> 00:59:24,772
But you forgot my breakfast.

603
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:27,571
I didn't forget your breakfast.

604
00:59:28,343 --> 00:59:30,174
I didn't bring your breakfast...

605
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:32,936
...because you didn't eat your din-din.

606
00:59:36,718 --> 00:59:38,413
We're right back where we started.

607
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:41,588
When I was on the stage, you had
to depend on me for everything...

608
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:44,417
...even the food you ate
came from me.

609
00:59:44,693 --> 00:59:47,127
Now you have to depend on me
for your food again.

610
00:59:47,395 --> 00:59:49,260
So you see, we're right back
where we started.

611
00:59:49,898 --> 00:59:51,729
Why are you doing this to me?

612
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,630
Why?

613
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:54,791
Doing what?

614
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:58,300
Making me afraid to eat,
trying to make me starve myself.

615
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:00,839
Don't be silly.

616
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,536
If you starve, you die.

617
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:06,303
I don't know what you're talking about.
You really must be sick!

618
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:11,719
Did you ever stop to think that...

619
01:00:12,254 --> 01:00:15,485
...if anything happened to me,
I mean anything bad...

620
01:00:16,558 --> 01:00:18,458
...there wouldn't be any money for you?

621
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:20,592
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.

622
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:22,797
You wouldn't even have pocket money.

623
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:25,856
Did you ever think of that?

624
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:28,599
I've thought about that.

625
01:00:33,475 --> 01:00:35,568
Why didn't you eat your dinner?

626
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:38,436
Because I'm afraid.

627
01:00:38,713 --> 01:00:40,408
You made me afraid.

628
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:44,744
I thought you were supposed to be
the big girl in this family.

629
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:49,653
Nothing wrong with it.

630
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,585
You're just a neurotic, Blanche!

631
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:55,894
D'you know that...

632
01:00:55,964 --> 01:00:57,795
...you're just a neurotic?

633
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:06,801
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning.

634
01:01:15,016 --> 01:01:17,644
- Please, Jane, I'm so hungry.
- I have to go now.

635
01:01:17,852 --> 01:01:19,820
But just a little, please!

636
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:24,352
No. You didn't eat your din-din,
so you'll have to wait till lunchtime.

637
01:01:24,626 --> 01:01:28,528
Jane, please... don't do this to me.
Jane! Please!

638
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:55,655
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning, Ms. Jane.

639
01:01:57,525 --> 01:01:59,356
I wanna talk to you.

640
01:01:59,594 --> 01:02:01,585
- I want to apologize.
- Apologize?

641
01:02:02,297 --> 01:02:06,028
I wasn't feeling so well yesterday,
so I was unkind to you.

642
01:02:06,968 --> 01:02:08,765
I want to make it up.

643
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,395
I got up this morning
and fixed the house.

644
01:02:12,674 --> 01:02:14,608
So you can have the whole day off.

645
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,308
Here's your $15.

646
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:20,677
Well, thanks, but does Miss...
What I mean, is...

647
01:02:20,982 --> 01:02:22,779
...does Ms. Blanche know
about my taking the day off?

648
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:24,341
Oh, sure, she knows.

649
01:02:25,253 --> 01:02:27,380
All right... if you say so.

650
01:02:27,722 --> 01:02:29,781
See you next Tuesday then.

651
01:02:30,925 --> 01:02:32,187
Have a good time.

652
01:02:33,261 --> 01:02:34,387
Goodbye.

653
01:02:45,273 --> 01:02:46,205
Bye!

654
01:04:10,859 --> 01:04:12,759
Who was that at the door earlier?

655
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:13,861
Elvira.

656
01:04:14,696 --> 01:04:16,755
Where is she now? In the kitchen?

657
01:04:17,766 --> 01:04:20,394
No. I gave her the day off.

658
01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:23,034
She has a pretty hard time, considering.

659
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:25,136
I told her to come back next week.

660
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:34,708
You know we got rats in the cellar?

661
01:07:09,871 --> 01:07:11,031
Good afternoon.

662
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:16,737
Mr. Flagg?

663
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:19,343
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.

664
01:07:21,082 --> 01:07:25,109
I have an appointment with
Ms. Hudson for 4:00 o'clock.

665
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,813
I'm Jane Hudson.

666
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:31,918
My, you're... you're right on time,
aren't you?

667
01:07:32,193 --> 01:07:33,990
Yes, I believe I am.

668
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:36,121
Come in.

669
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:58,676
We can talk here in the living room.

670
01:08:03,891 --> 01:08:07,987
Oh, I say... what a perfectly
charming room.

671
01:08:11,165 --> 01:08:14,032
- So, you're Edwin Flagg?
- Yes, that's right.

672
01:08:15,536 --> 01:08:17,470
I'll bring you some tea. You like tea?

673
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:20,339
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.

674
01:08:20,608 --> 01:08:22,667
You must've guessed that I'm English.

675
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,537
Oh, really? How nice for you.

676
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:40,815
Oh, here, let me help you.

677
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:42,181
That's a terribly big...

678
01:09:42,256 --> 01:09:44,417
...burden for such a little girl.

679
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:47,124
Thank you. You're very kind.

680
01:09:49,063 --> 01:09:51,725
It's so hot today.
Did you drive here in your car?

681
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,864
Well, actually I took a cab.

682
01:09:53,968 --> 01:09:57,768
It's a bit of a nuisance, but I had
to put my car in for servicing.

683
01:09:58,706 --> 01:10:00,139
- Oh. Cream or lemon?
- Cream.

684
01:10:02,477 --> 01:10:03,705
Sugar?

685
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,645
My, it looks good.

686
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:16,880
I always think it's nice
to break bread...

687
01:10:17,058 --> 01:10:19,583
...with strangers, don't you?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

688
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,755
I don't think you actually mentioned
the exact nature of...

689
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:27,395
Well, I've been retired
for some time now.

690
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:30,604
I've been taking care of someone
in my family who's sick.

691
01:10:30,705 --> 01:10:32,832
And now you're free to return
to your profession?

692
01:10:32,907 --> 01:10:33,737
Yes.

693
01:10:34,809 --> 01:10:36,276
And what exactly...

694
01:10:36,844 --> 01:10:39,779
I mean, I take it you are a soloist.
Some instrument?

695
01:10:42,617 --> 01:10:44,812
I wonder if you can guess who I am.

696
01:10:48,856 --> 01:10:50,221
Can you give me a hint?

697
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:53,626
Well, it's not fair to make you guess.

698
01:10:54,929 --> 01:10:57,124
I'm Baby Jane Hudson!

699
01:11:06,274 --> 01:11:09,869
Oh! Do you mean you're really
the Baby Jane Hudson?

700
01:11:10,378 --> 01:11:11,504
Yes, I am!

701
01:11:11,746 --> 01:11:15,011
And I'm going to revive my act
exactly as I used to do it.

702
01:11:15,249 --> 01:11:17,911
Of course, some of the arrangements
will have to be brought up to date.

703
01:11:17,985 --> 01:11:20,647
Music changes so much, doesn't it?

704
01:11:20,922 --> 01:11:22,787
And you know, they're desperate
for new acts. Television...

705
01:11:22,857 --> 01:11:25,223
...Las Vegas and all the clubs and...

706
01:11:25,459 --> 01:11:28,451
...there are a lot of people
who remember me, lots of them.

707
01:11:29,997 --> 01:11:31,988
I don't see how you could fail.

708
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,165
You know, I had a kind of a feeling...

709
01:11:41,242 --> 01:11:43,472
...the minute I opened that door
and saw you standing there.

710
01:11:43,878 --> 01:11:46,676
I just knew we were going to be friends.

711
01:11:46,914 --> 01:11:48,848
I've been thinking about costumes.

712
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:50,247
Costumes...

713
01:11:50,318 --> 01:11:51,512
Yes. I took some of my old ones...

714
01:11:51,586 --> 01:11:54,020
...down to be copied.
You think that's a good idea?

715
01:11:54,288 --> 01:11:55,619
Of course.

716
01:11:56,023 --> 01:11:58,457
But I don't quite remember...

717
01:11:58,693 --> 01:12:00,456
How silly of me, Edwin.
How could you?

718
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:03,220
But I do want your opinion.
I really do.

719
01:12:03,331 --> 01:12:05,492
All my scrap books and stuff
are in the rehearsal room and...

720
01:12:05,566 --> 01:12:07,727
...you can look at them
and tell me what you think.

721
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,896
- You'd like to see them, wouldn't you?
- Well, of course.

722
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:17,538
Oh, I wish Daddy could be here
right now!

723
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:21,113
"You can never lose your talent,"
he used to tell me.

724
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:24,681
"You can lose everything
but you can't lose your talent!"

725
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,691
I think you'll find these clippings...

726
01:12:33,761 --> 01:12:35,319
...very interesting.

727
01:12:35,529 --> 01:12:37,690
Daddy saved them for me
from the very first.

728
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:40,366
He used to put them in special books.

729
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:45,300
I always liked that picture.

730
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,134
It's so sad.

731
01:12:56,284 --> 01:12:58,149
- Will you excuse me?
- Yes, certainly.

732
01:13:11,165 --> 01:13:14,225
You always spoil everything!
Don't you?!

733
01:13:14,802 --> 01:13:17,566
- No, Jane. I just wanted to know...
- Who is down there? I'll tell ya!

734
01:13:18,272 --> 01:13:21,173
I got a friend down there.
Someone who's come to see me!

735
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:24,468
He doesn't even know you exist!
And you don't like that, do you?

736
01:13:24,612 --> 01:13:26,876
But you're wrong, Jane.
I've always wanted you to have friends.

737
01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:28,347
That's what I've always wanted, really.

738
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:29,815
Then how come I never had any?

739
01:13:30,051 --> 01:13:31,575
Well, maybe you weren't...

740
01:13:32,086 --> 01:13:34,281
...I've, I mean, you were
just too independent...

741
01:13:34,588 --> 01:13:35,577
No, that's not why!

742
01:13:35,656 --> 01:13:37,886
You always stopped me
from having friends, that's why!

743
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:40,293
Not anymore, Jane, not anymore.

744
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:44,156
I'm pleased that you have a friend.
That's what you need.

745
01:13:44,231 --> 01:13:46,665
- Oh, sure!
- I was just hoping maybe...

746
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:50,303
...I could meet him and we could have
a nice talk just the three of us.

747
01:13:50,538 --> 01:13:51,971
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

748
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:54,367
Then you could tell him
a whole lot of lies about me.

749
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:55,973
Scare him off...

750
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,302
...or maybe have him...

751
01:13:57,378 --> 01:13:59,039
...for yourself!

752
01:14:39,086 --> 01:14:43,580
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

753
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,254
"His address is heaven above. "

754
01:14:50,064 --> 01:14:51,656
That's wonderful!

755
01:15:03,577 --> 01:15:07,707
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

756
01:15:08,582 --> 01:15:12,746
"His address is heaven above.

757
01:15:14,522 --> 01:15:18,720
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

758
01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:23,820
"... and wish you were with us to love.

759
01:15:26,734 --> 01:15:30,727
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.

760
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:35,903
"The postman says that's best to do.

761
01:15:38,345 --> 01:15:42,441
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

762
01:15:42,516 --> 01:15:47,510
"... saying, I love you.

763
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:45,106
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

764
01:16:45,212 --> 01:16:49,444
"... saying, I love you!"

765
01:17:10,838 --> 01:17:12,806
Oh, Edwin, you certainly
can play, can't you?

766
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,975
- And you certainly can sing.
- Oh, thank you.

767
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:18,978
I can see you've done
this kind of work before.

768
01:17:19,213 --> 01:17:20,407
No. Not really.

769
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:23,343
Actually, I've spent most of my time
on serious music.

770
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:25,044
Composing, and that sort of thing.

771
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,383
You mean, this will be your
first contact with show business?

772
01:17:27,621 --> 01:17:28,781
Not exactly.

773
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:31,991
You see, my father was
quite well known as an actor.

774
01:17:32,259 --> 01:17:34,489
In the movies?
Maybe I worked with him.

775
01:17:34,762 --> 01:17:37,128
I shouldn't think so.

776
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:39,956
He's been dead quite a long time now.

777
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:42,829
I lost my daddy when
I was quite young, too.

778
01:17:43,103 --> 01:17:46,038
Of course, he was more in the
classical tradition, I mean as an actor.

779
01:17:46,307 --> 01:17:48,002
Shakespeare and that sort of thing.

780
01:17:48,142 --> 01:17:51,077
People used to say Daddy could've been
a star in his own right.

781
01:17:51,345 --> 01:17:53,040
He was a musician, too.

782
01:17:53,214 --> 01:17:54,272
Oh? What instrument?

783
01:17:54,348 --> 01:17:55,679
Piano and banjo.

784
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:00,850
Oh, that's very interesting.

785
01:18:01,121 --> 01:18:04,113
You know, the banjo's a very
native American instrument.

786
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,290
Of course, my father was British...

787
01:18:06,794 --> 01:18:07,761
...but he never...

788
01:18:07,828 --> 01:18:10,524
...really got a chance
out here in Hollywood.

789
01:18:10,898 --> 01:18:12,559
Oh, that's too bad.

790
01:18:24,078 --> 01:18:25,204
It's funny, really.

791
01:18:25,446 --> 01:18:28,609
Because actually he came from a
rather distinguished family, socially...

792
01:18:28,849 --> 01:18:32,114
...and yet nearly all the parts he had
were playing menials, butlers and such.

793
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:33,942
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

794
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:36,416
I don't think my mother...

795
01:18:36,657 --> 01:18:39,558
...ever really appreciated
what he was trying to do.

796
01:18:40,027 --> 01:18:41,619
Oh, I know what you mean.

797
01:18:41,895 --> 01:18:45,422
It's very hard for an artist
when people don't understand.

798
01:18:45,799 --> 01:18:46,697
I remember when...

799
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:49,201
I sometimes try to explain to her...

800
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:51,465
...that if you're going to produce
anything decent in the way...

801
01:18:51,538 --> 01:18:53,267
...of serious music...

802
01:18:54,074 --> 01:18:57,134
...you must have the right atmosphere.

803
01:18:57,578 --> 01:18:59,671
But of course.
Delia can't understand that.

804
01:19:01,015 --> 01:19:03,347
Delia? Who's Delia?

805
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:07,477
You might not think it to look at her,
but she is my mother.

806
01:19:10,324 --> 01:19:12,349
For a minute I thought you had...

807
01:19:12,593 --> 01:19:14,424
...a wife or a lady friend...

808
01:19:14,695 --> 01:19:16,287
...tucked away somewhere.

809
01:19:18,432 --> 01:19:23,233
Oh, no. Nothing like that. How much
were you actually thinking of paying?

810
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:24,795
Paying?

811
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:30,970
Well, what do you think?

812
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:36,915
How about a $100?

813
01:19:37,818 --> 01:19:39,877
A week, of course.

814
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:44,047
Oh. I think that would be fair.

815
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:46,088
Then that's settled.

816
01:19:46,226 --> 01:19:47,989
I don't like talking about money,
do you?

817
01:19:48,228 --> 01:19:51,789
No. It's not that important, is it?
Not like relationships between people...

818
01:19:52,066 --> 01:19:54,796
...but the thing is, if I'm going to
move out and give up my pupils...

819
01:19:55,069 --> 01:19:56,934
...I'll have to know for sure.

820
01:19:57,338 --> 01:19:59,499
When were you thinking of starting?

821
01:20:00,307 --> 01:20:02,832
Just when could you let me
have some money?

822
01:20:04,044 --> 01:20:08,538
Well, I've some family matters
to take care of...

823
01:20:09,616 --> 01:20:12,551
...that should take about a week or so.

824
01:20:12,886 --> 01:20:16,253
Well, then I don't see why
we couldn't start rehearsing right away.

825
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:20,791
Tell you what, Edwin...

826
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:25,361
...I'll pay you first thing Wednesday,
a month in advance.

827
01:20:26,934 --> 01:20:28,162
It's done.

828
01:20:28,502 --> 01:20:30,868
How about going to dinner
somewhere nice?

829
01:20:31,138 --> 01:20:32,867
Oh, it sounds fine.

830
01:20:33,474 --> 01:20:34,873
Why don't you come with me now?

831
01:20:34,942 --> 01:20:36,842
I've got to go down and pick up
my costumes and then...

832
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:38,878
...we could go on to dinner from there.

833
01:20:39,713 --> 01:20:44,150
Oh, I promised my mo...
... Delia I'd be home for supper.

834
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:47,549
Oh. Well, I'll drive you home then.

835
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:50,687
Oh, I'm so excited.

836
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:54,587
You know, I know everything
is going to go just marvelously.

837
01:20:55,195 --> 01:20:58,221
I have to go up and change.
I won't be a minute.

838
01:21:19,153 --> 01:21:20,085
This is really...

839
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,515
...a rather charming neighborhood.

840
01:21:25,559 --> 01:21:28,323
Yes, I've always found it very nice.

841
01:23:35,622 --> 01:23:37,590
I just can't wait to get started now,
rehearsing.

842
01:23:37,824 --> 01:23:39,689
We're going to be a great team,
the two of us.

843
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,121
Oh, I'm sure we are.

844
01:23:44,131 --> 01:23:45,962
I'll see you Wednesday. Bye.

845
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:43,232
This is Blanche, Blanche Hudson.

846
01:26:44,444 --> 01:26:47,709
I need your help. Is the doctor there?
I must talk to him.

847
01:26:48,048 --> 01:26:49,743
Well, he's with a patient right now.

848
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:52,978
But I have to talk to him.
I've got to.

849
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,284
Hold on, please.
I'll see if I can interrupt him.

850
01:27:00,327 --> 01:27:03,728
Ms. Hill tells me you're a little upset.
What seems to be the trouble?

851
01:27:05,165 --> 01:27:07,497
You must come. I need you here.

852
01:27:14,307 --> 01:27:16,275
No. It's about my sister.

853
01:27:17,077 --> 01:27:19,545
I need your help. I need you here.

854
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,445
Here at the house.

855
01:27:22,182 --> 01:27:24,309
No. It's nothing like that.

856
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:27,883
It's the way she's behaving.

857
01:27:28,855 --> 01:27:32,586
You've got to come over right away.
Please, before she comes back.

858
01:27:32,793 --> 01:27:34,158
I don't quite understand.

859
01:27:34,394 --> 01:27:36,828
Is this some kind of emotional
disturbance you're talking about?

860
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:40,588
Yes, she's emotionally disturbed.

861
01:27:41,034 --> 01:27:42,865
She's unbalanced.

862
01:27:44,604 --> 01:27:46,629
I don't know, doctor.

863
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,240
Are you trying to tell me
that she's violent?

864
01:27:50,076 --> 01:27:51,008
Yes!

865
01:27:51,578 --> 01:27:52,738
Yes, she is!

866
01:28:10,297 --> 01:28:12,458
I'm... not sure.

867
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,409
We aren't getting anywhere like this.
I'll come over right away.

868
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:36,212
I know who it was.

869
01:28:36,489 --> 01:28:37,820
No, Jane, that really was...

870
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:40,422
And I know what you're trying to do.

871
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:43,128
I'm not trying to do anything.
Honestly, Jane.

872
01:29:46,293 --> 01:29:48,488
This is Blanche Hudson again.

873
01:29:48,828 --> 01:29:50,227
Could I speak to the doctor?

874
01:29:50,563 --> 01:29:53,999
Oh, yes, certainly. Hold on, please.
I'll try and catch him.

875
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:05,107
Hello, Blanche. I'm on my way now.

876
01:30:05,979 --> 01:30:08,675
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in time.

877
01:30:08,949 --> 01:30:11,975
Dr. Shelby, we're not going
to need you after all.

878
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,149
I know, but Jane has gone
to another doctor.

879
01:30:18,058 --> 01:30:21,118
- Another doctor?
- Yes. Another doctor.

880
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:24,258
Well, of course, if she's chosen
to go to someone else...

881
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:30,130
Well, after all,
we really can't interfere, can we?

882
01:30:30,403 --> 01:30:32,963
If Jane's chosen to go
to another doctor...

883
01:30:33,773 --> 01:30:35,570
I'm very sorry.

884
01:30:42,215 --> 01:30:44,342
Goodbye, doctor.

885
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:26,356
I thought I told you not to come back
until next week.

886
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:29,553
Yes, but I had a free day today
so I thought I'd come by and see...

887
01:31:29,696 --> 01:31:32,028
...if there was anything needed doin'.
- Well, there isn't anything.

888
01:31:32,098 --> 01:31:34,123
So you could've saved yourself
the trouble.

889
01:31:34,801 --> 01:31:37,463
I was gonna write you a note, but now
you're here I may as well tell you.

890
01:31:37,704 --> 01:31:39,467
We're not gonna be
needing you anymore.

891
01:31:40,206 --> 01:31:41,833
But I don't understand.

892
01:31:42,075 --> 01:31:43,372
We're closing up the house.

893
01:31:43,643 --> 01:31:45,702
Blanche wants to take
a smaller place at the beach.

894
01:31:45,812 --> 01:31:48,610
The doctor thinks that's best for her
so that's what we're going to do.

895
01:31:49,015 --> 01:31:52,143
Oh, don't worry, you'll be paid
for today. I'll send you a check.

896
01:31:52,419 --> 01:31:54,011
I'm not worried about any pay.

897
01:31:54,087 --> 01:31:56,078
I'd just like to see
Ms. Blanche before I go.

898
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:59,622
Well, you can't. She's asleep.

899
01:32:01,795 --> 01:32:03,729
That's all right. I don't mind waiting.

900
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:06,655
Well, I do, I gotta leave,
so just gimme the keys to the house.

901
01:32:09,469 --> 01:32:12,370
I'm sorry, I don't have the keys.
I must've left 'em at home.

902
01:32:12,705 --> 01:32:14,229
Anyway, go. You're fired.

903
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:07,749
Ms. Blanche, are you awake?

904
01:34:29,576 --> 01:34:31,635
Are you all right in there?

905
01:34:35,181 --> 01:34:37,911
Wait now, and I'll go find the key.

906
01:34:42,488 --> 01:34:43,386
Thank you.

907
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,153
Good morning, Ms. Hudson.

908
01:34:50,096 --> 01:34:51,620
How's Ms. Blanche these days?

909
01:34:52,832 --> 01:34:54,823
She's just fine.

910
01:34:55,401 --> 01:34:57,130
Your deposit slip?

911
01:34:57,837 --> 01:35:00,738
Well, Blanche wanted me
to get it all in cash this time.

912
01:35:01,007 --> 01:35:04,670
- I guess she has some special reason.
- Yes, but doesn't she normally?

913
01:35:04,944 --> 01:35:08,243
I mean if she isn't going to deposit
her monthly check, she usually...

914
01:35:08,314 --> 01:35:11,147
...gives us a call and tells us what
she wants us to do, doesn't she?

915
01:35:11,517 --> 01:35:13,178
- Didn't she call?
- I don't think so.

916
01:35:14,187 --> 01:35:17,850
Oh, I guess she must still be asleep.
She gave me that check last night.

917
01:35:18,191 --> 01:35:20,751
I see. Just a moment, please.

918
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:38,066
I guess that'll be all right,
Ms. Hudson.

919
01:35:38,978 --> 01:35:41,378
- Fifty and twenties, all right?
- Yes, please.

920
01:35:48,521 --> 01:35:51,649
- There you are.
- Thank you.

921
01:35:59,666 --> 01:36:02,658
Ms. Blanche, I'll tell you right now,
if that sister of yours...

922
01:36:02,769 --> 01:36:05,738
...has gone and given you
sleeping pills to keep you quiet...

923
01:36:05,772 --> 01:36:07,763
...while she's out doin'
I don't know what...

924
01:36:08,007 --> 01:36:11,272
...I'm sure as hell
gonna call the police on her.

925
01:36:11,944 --> 01:36:13,639
It's all right, Ms. Blanche.

926
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,586
I'm glad I caught you.

927
01:36:28,661 --> 01:36:31,960
I hope you don't mind, but there's
something I've been meaning to ask you.

928
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:34,727
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm kind of
short of help around the house and...

929
01:36:34,801 --> 01:36:36,894
...I was wondering if you'd mind me
asking your cleaning lady...

930
01:36:36,969 --> 01:36:38,869
...if she could give me
a couple of days a week.

931
01:36:39,138 --> 01:36:41,766
As far as I'm concerned,
you can have her as often as you want.

932
01:36:42,041 --> 01:36:43,303
My sister and I are moving.

933
01:36:43,376 --> 01:36:44,707
So we won't want her anymore.

934
01:36:44,777 --> 01:36:47,007
But you'll have to call her
because she isn't here.

935
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,547
I've already sent her home.

936
01:36:49,248 --> 01:36:51,011
But I just saw her.

937
01:36:51,284 --> 01:36:53,343
Yes, but I sent her home.

938
01:36:53,486 --> 01:36:55,317
Oh, no, but that's impossible.

939
01:36:55,588 --> 01:36:58,489
I saw her go into the house
a few minutes ago.

940
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:05,092
- In the house?
- Yes.

941
01:37:29,322 --> 01:37:31,085
So, you finally decided to come back.

942
01:37:32,692 --> 01:37:34,091
What're you doing here?

943
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:37,891
- I told you, you were fired.
- Never mind all that.

944
01:37:37,997 --> 01:37:39,897
I want to know what's goin' on
around here.

945
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:42,963
But you said you didn't have your key.

946
01:37:43,469 --> 01:37:45,061
It just so happened that I did.

947
01:37:45,138 --> 01:37:48,403
So now you can tell me what you mean
by lockin' Ms. Blanche in her room.

948
01:37:51,577 --> 01:37:54,011
This isn't Blanche's house, this is
my house. And I can do what I like.

949
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,071
It doesn't make a bit of difference
whose house it is.

950
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:58,515
You've got to act like a grown woman,
the same as everybody else.

951
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:00,118
Suppose there'd been a fire
or somethin'...

952
01:38:00,186 --> 01:38:01,778
...and Ms. Blanche locked up
in her room like that?

953
01:38:01,854 --> 01:38:03,048
Well, there wasn't.

954
01:38:03,289 --> 01:38:06,383
You open that door and
stop all this nonsense.

955
01:38:06,759 --> 01:38:08,249
Then give me the key!

956
01:38:08,795 --> 01:38:11,389
She's asleep. I gave her a pill.

957
01:38:11,998 --> 01:38:13,226
You did, huh?

958
01:38:13,466 --> 01:38:15,957
Then you better give me that key
and be quick about it.

959
01:38:16,702 --> 01:38:19,330
I won't, and you can't make me.

960
01:38:19,705 --> 01:38:20,763
I'm not afraid of you.

961
01:38:21,374 --> 01:38:24,775
All right, Ms. Hudson.
I'm not going to fool with you.

962
01:38:24,844 --> 01:38:26,334
If you won't give me that key...

963
01:38:26,412 --> 01:38:28,880
...I'll go right and call the police.

964
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:32,215
You'll be sorry.

965
01:38:32,885 --> 01:38:34,375
Give me that key.

966
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:48,656
I didn't mean her any harm.

967
01:38:48,935 --> 01:38:50,835
You better not have done her any harm.

968
01:39:00,213 --> 01:39:02,113
What has she done to you?

969
01:39:10,323 --> 01:39:11,847
Get it off in a minute.

970
01:39:12,492 --> 01:39:15,017
Don't worry, Ms. Blanche.
I'll get you down from there.

971
01:39:18,764 --> 01:39:20,288
You just rest easy.

972
01:39:36,816 --> 01:39:38,807
Going out are you, dear?

973
01:39:41,287 --> 01:39:42,345
You know I am.

974
01:39:42,455 --> 01:39:44,355
Having dinner with her?

975
01:39:46,325 --> 01:39:48,452
I'm forgotten.

976
01:39:48,728 --> 01:39:52,255
Now you won't be back too late,
will you, lovey? Huh?

977
01:39:59,105 --> 01:40:00,868
Who knows?

978
01:40:18,491 --> 01:40:21,654
You could've been
better than all of 'em.

979
01:40:22,595 --> 01:40:25,223
But they didn't want that.

980
01:40:33,906 --> 01:40:36,306
They just didn't love you enough.

981
01:40:37,977 --> 01:40:41,344
Do you know that?
They just didn't love you enough.

982
01:41:40,973 --> 01:41:43,066
I'm sorry, Edwin.

983
01:41:43,743 --> 01:41:46,177
I can't let you in.

984
01:41:46,879 --> 01:41:48,244
Not now.

985
01:42:03,996 --> 01:42:05,657
Go to hell!

986
01:42:16,542 --> 01:42:18,737
I can't let you in.

987
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:26,812
Not now.

988
01:42:54,213 --> 01:42:57,614
What am I going to do?

989
01:45:13,419 --> 01:45:16,149
I thought... I didn't know
there was anyone in here.

990
01:45:17,122 --> 01:45:18,885
I just came home and saw a light...

991
01:45:19,158 --> 01:45:21,888
...and I thought perhaps you'd left
the lights of your car on.

992
01:45:22,161 --> 01:45:23,753
You know, I've had that happen to me.

993
01:45:23,829 --> 01:45:25,228
That's all right, Mrs. Bates.

994
01:45:25,998 --> 01:45:28,899
I had that happen to me once,
it's no joke.

995
01:45:29,168 --> 01:45:32,001
Wake up in the morning and find
you've got a dead battery.

996
01:45:32,905 --> 01:45:33,997
No joke.

997
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:38,871
Well, as long as everything's
all right...

998
01:45:40,112 --> 01:45:41,773
...I guess I'll just say good night.

999
01:45:41,947 --> 01:45:42,777
Good night.

1000
01:47:35,494 --> 01:47:37,655
That doesn't prove anything.

1001
01:47:37,696 --> 01:47:39,664
Now what do you think you'll do?

1002
01:47:39,798 --> 01:47:41,527
I'll manage, lovey.

1003
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,999
I suppose you think
I'm making all this up.

1004
01:47:43,068 --> 01:47:44,296
I wouldn't know.

1005
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:46,333
Well, Hazel should know, shouldn't she?

1006
01:47:46,405 --> 01:47:48,839
She worked right in the same studio
and that's when it all happened.

1007
01:47:49,074 --> 01:47:51,599
Just after one of those studio parties.

1008
01:47:51,877 --> 01:47:53,572
And right in front of her own house.

1009
01:47:53,846 --> 01:47:57,475
Jane Hudson drove a car straight at her
own sister and crippled her for life.

1010
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:59,581
Come on. You mean,
she tried to kill her?

1011
01:47:59,818 --> 01:48:02,810
Yes, she did. She tried
to murder her own sister.

1012
01:48:03,088 --> 01:48:04,953
How is it they didn't arrest her then?

1013
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:07,624
Oh, they would've, but the studio
had it all hushed up...

1014
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:09,725
...on account
of Blanche Hudson's career.

1015
01:48:09,995 --> 01:48:11,485
That sounds very likely.

1016
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:14,460
Yes, doesn't it. So the fine woman
you've chosen to run around with...

1017
01:48:14,533 --> 01:48:18,401
...turns out to be broke
and a murderer as well.

1018
01:48:18,637 --> 01:48:19,535
Well, it's true.

1019
01:48:19,671 --> 01:48:22,799
All right then, if it's true, I'll ask
her about it when I see her again.

1020
01:48:22,941 --> 01:48:25,307
You wouldn't see a woman
like that again?

1021
01:48:25,377 --> 01:48:27,368
Why not? You just told me,
she's got a rich sister.

1022
01:48:27,446 --> 01:48:30,074
You haven't heard the worst of it yet.

1023
01:48:30,315 --> 01:48:32,306
- You mean there's more?
- Yes, there is.

1024
01:48:32,551 --> 01:48:37,011
After she'd run down her own sister,
your precious Jane Hudson ran off and...

1025
01:48:37,256 --> 01:48:40,248
...left her there to die,
like some poor animal.

1026
01:48:40,526 --> 01:48:43,723
She ran off and disappeared
for three whole days.

1027
01:48:43,996 --> 01:48:46,464
So what happened then?
Don't tell me they couldn't find her.

1028
01:48:46,732 --> 01:48:49,462
Oh, they found her all right.
They found her all right.

1029
01:48:49,735 --> 01:48:52,067
They found her in some hotel room...

1030
01:48:52,304 --> 01:48:54,602
...with a man that she'd
never even seen before.

1031
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:58,105
Why should that upset you?

1032
01:48:59,111 --> 01:49:02,012
Isn't that how I was conceived?

1033
01:49:26,972 --> 01:49:29,031
Yes, this is Ms. Hudson.

1034
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:47,155
She left.

1035
01:49:50,329 --> 01:49:51,819
About a week ago.

1036
01:49:53,232 --> 01:49:57,498
We have a report here, filed by her
cousin, listing her as a missing person.

1037
01:49:57,803 --> 01:50:00,670
Did she tell you what her plans were,
anything like that?

1038
01:50:02,908 --> 01:50:05,342
No, I don't know a thing.

1039
01:50:05,544 --> 01:50:07,307
Well, we have a couple of
other addresses to check.

1040
01:50:07,379 --> 01:50:08,869
Maybe we'll come up with something.

1041
01:50:08,947 --> 01:50:11,939
Otherwise, we'll probably be
getting in touch with you again.

1042
01:50:12,151 --> 01:50:15,609
Meanwhile, if you do hear from her,
we would appreciate you letting us know.

1043
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:47,914
The police are looking for Elvira.

1044
01:50:48,787 --> 01:50:49,913
It wasn't my fault.

1045
01:50:50,155 --> 01:50:52,953
She wouldn't go away, you heard her,
she wouldn't leave me alone.

1046
01:50:53,158 --> 01:50:56,821
I don't know what to do, Blanche.
What am I going to do?

1047
01:51:02,201 --> 01:51:04,192
What am I going to do?

1048
01:51:07,573 --> 01:51:09,973
If they find her,
we'll have to run away.

1049
01:51:10,242 --> 01:51:13,439
That's what we'll do.
We'll go away.

1050
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:17,613
Oh, but then I wouldn't
see Edwin anymore.

1051
01:51:17,849 --> 01:51:20,215
He wouldn't like what I did.

1052
01:51:20,552 --> 01:51:24,318
It wasn't my fault,
but he wouldn't like it.

1053
01:51:25,524 --> 01:51:26,718
I don't care.

1054
01:51:26,992 --> 01:51:28,584
We'll just go to the beach.

1055
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:30,958
We'll go and live at the seashore
all the time, like we used to...

1056
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:33,725
...when I was little
and Daddy was there.

1057
01:51:33,966 --> 01:51:36,400
And maybe we'll have friends.

1058
01:51:36,635 --> 01:51:40,127
People would come and see us.
Oh, I'd like that.

1059
01:51:49,214 --> 01:51:51,307
Blanche, listen to me.

1060
01:51:52,651 --> 01:51:55,381
You know, I always wanted
everything to be nice, don't you?

1061
01:51:56,054 --> 01:51:59,023
I don't see how Elvira could
make me do a thing like that.

1062
01:51:59,258 --> 01:52:01,283
I just don't understand.

1063
01:52:01,727 --> 01:52:04,093
It was like that time
in the hotel room...

1064
01:52:04,363 --> 01:52:08,129
...when they came and told me that
you were hurt and that I'd done it.

1065
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:11,733
And there was a big man there,
a policeman.

1066
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:13,961
And he hit me and
he slapped me and...

1067
01:52:14,206 --> 01:52:17,801
...I tried to tell him that
I couldn't do a thing like that.

1068
01:52:17,876 --> 01:52:20,276
Not to my own sister.

1069
01:52:27,019 --> 01:52:29,283
He said I was a liar.

1070
01:52:30,656 --> 01:52:32,453
The accident, it...

1071
01:52:33,325 --> 01:52:35,589
No, it wasn't an accident.

1072
01:52:35,727 --> 01:52:39,128
I did it. You told me so yourself.

1073
01:52:43,168 --> 01:52:44,965
I must tell you.

1074
01:52:45,637 --> 01:52:47,798
I don't want to talk about it.

1075
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:51,339
Every time I think about something nice,
you remind me of all the bad things.

1076
01:52:51,576 --> 01:52:54,306
I only want to talk about
the nice things.

1077
01:52:59,818 --> 01:53:03,413
Remember when Daddy and I
used to rehearse at the beach?

1078
01:53:04,823 --> 01:53:07,189
I'd be dancing on the sand...

1079
01:53:07,859 --> 01:53:10,589
...and all the people
would come and watch...

1080
01:53:11,029 --> 01:53:14,795
...all crowd around to see
Baby Jane Hudson.

1081
01:53:24,876 --> 01:53:26,275
What'll I do?

1082
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:29,144
- Let them in.
- Oh, but what if?

1083
01:53:30,982 --> 01:53:33,007
It may be Edwin.

1084
01:53:36,121 --> 01:53:38,988
Of course, Edwin.

1085
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,059
You want to make him tell on me.

1086
01:54:17,496 --> 01:54:19,123
Wait for me!

1087
01:54:29,908 --> 01:54:32,274
I'm sorry, Ms. Hudson but we just
picked up this young man...

1088
01:54:32,411 --> 01:54:33,673
...in front of your house.

1089
01:54:33,745 --> 01:54:36,009
Says he's on his way in
to see you. Is that right?

1090
01:54:38,183 --> 01:54:39,514
I don't understand.

1091
01:54:39,751 --> 01:54:41,912
They're trying to say I'm drunk.

1092
01:54:42,187 --> 01:54:44,348
Let's just say you're
a little happy, okay?

1093
01:54:44,589 --> 01:54:46,284
Who's happy?

1094
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:48,259
I'm not happy.

1095
01:54:55,567 --> 01:54:56,659
So now you know.

1096
01:54:57,569 --> 01:54:59,969
That's right. So now we know.

1097
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:03,132
Sorry to have bothered you,
Ms. Hudson. Good night.

1098
01:55:27,532 --> 01:55:31,969
I have the money. Really, I have.
But don't be mean to me.

1099
01:55:32,471 --> 01:55:33,836
You promised me.

1100
01:55:33,905 --> 01:55:37,068
I know I did, and I have the money.

1101
01:55:37,275 --> 01:55:40,870
Look, let's go in the kitchen
and have a drink together.

1102
01:55:41,146 --> 01:55:42,613
It's nice there.
And then...

1103
01:55:42,714 --> 01:55:45,683
...we can be friends again,
and everything.

1104
01:55:46,218 --> 01:55:47,446
And everything...

1105
01:55:47,853 --> 01:55:49,616
- I've got something else for you, too.
- What?

1106
01:55:49,688 --> 01:55:52,657
It's a surprise. Would you like to?

1107
01:56:00,198 --> 01:56:02,063
You're gonna like your present.

1108
01:56:04,336 --> 01:56:06,395
You're really gonna like it.

1109
01:56:06,605 --> 01:56:08,334
Drink your drink, Edwin.

1110
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:14,376
I'll go and get it for you.

1111
01:56:45,544 --> 01:56:47,876
This is my very own.

1112
01:56:49,047 --> 01:56:51,914
It's a genuine Baby Jane Doll.

1113
01:56:53,351 --> 01:56:56,479
I used to give them
to all my really good friends...

1114
01:56:56,621 --> 01:56:59,556
...the people that I worked with.

1115
01:56:59,858 --> 01:57:01,689
- They made them for me.
- Marvelous.

1116
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,159
Specially.

1117
01:57:03,528 --> 01:57:05,120
Very lifelike.

1118
01:57:05,463 --> 01:57:08,591
Now Jane, you talk
to nice Mr. Flagg, and...

1119
01:57:09,067 --> 01:57:13,299
...nice Mr. Flagg will have
his money in a minute.

1120
01:57:26,952 --> 01:57:30,046
Oh, you're not comfy
like that, are you?

1121
01:57:47,706 --> 01:57:49,196
Shall we go bye-bye?

1122
01:58:03,088 --> 01:58:05,318
Here comes the Super Chief.

1123
01:58:18,103 --> 01:58:19,695
What was that?

1124
01:58:19,804 --> 01:58:22,739
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

1125
01:58:28,913 --> 01:58:31,609
She'll take you away from me.

1126
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:43,784
Please...

1127
01:58:44,929 --> 01:58:46,123
...help me.

1128
01:59:01,813 --> 01:59:03,542
She's dying.

1129
01:59:05,684 --> 01:59:08,380
For God's sake.

1130
01:59:10,321 --> 01:59:11,481
She's dying.

1131
01:59:12,357 --> 01:59:14,689
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

1132
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:19,425
Edwin, I've got your money.

1133
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:24,232
Edwin, you forgot your money!

1134
01:59:34,045 --> 01:59:35,945
He hates me.

1135
01:59:42,187 --> 01:59:44,121
He hates me.

1136
02:00:08,113 --> 02:00:10,513
He's going to tell.

1137
02:00:33,838 --> 02:00:36,705
You've got to help me.

1138
02:00:37,509 --> 02:00:39,443
We've got to leave.

1139
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:44,444
Please, Blanche.

1140
02:00:46,351 --> 02:00:49,081
Help me, please.

1141
02:03:15,166 --> 02:03:17,634
I like this place.

1142
02:03:17,869 --> 02:03:20,429
We can just sit here for a while.

1143
02:03:20,705 --> 02:03:24,573
And pretty soon the sun will
come up and it will be nice.

1144
02:03:26,144 --> 02:03:28,612
You should look at the sea.

1145
02:03:28,846 --> 02:03:31,747
It has all lights on it.

1146
02:03:32,150 --> 02:03:34,448
You used to like that.

1147
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:05,749
We interrupt this program to bring you
a special news bulletin.

1148
02:04:05,984 --> 02:04:08,851
At 11:25 this morning all local
law-enforcement agencies...

1149
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:10,285
...had assigned special details...

1150
02:04:10,355 --> 02:04:14,086
...to the kidnap-slaying mystery that
surrounds the famed Hudson sisters.

1151
02:04:14,359 --> 02:04:17,260
It is believed that Blanche Hudson,
film great of the early Thirties...

1152
02:04:17,528 --> 02:04:19,519
...has been forcibly abducted
by her sister...

1153
02:04:19,597 --> 02:04:21,622
...former child star,
Baby Jane Hudson...

1154
02:04:21,899 --> 02:04:24,299
...from the family home on
Northwood Avenue in Hollywood...

1155
02:04:24,369 --> 02:04:27,805
...sometime between the hours of
10:00 p. m. And 10:30 p. m. Last evening.

1156
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:30,304
With the exception of one witness...

1157
02:04:30,408 --> 02:04:34,139
...who reportedly saw the Hudson car,
a 1940 or 1941 black convertible...

1158
02:04:34,412 --> 02:04:36,710
...heading west on Wilshire
and Santa Monica...

1159
02:04:36,981 --> 02:04:39,472
...no report has been received.

1160
02:05:08,379 --> 02:05:10,347
I see you found that colored woman.

1161
02:05:10,581 --> 02:05:11,741
They found her all right.

1162
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:15,017
Sure is a rotten way to get
your picture in the papers.

1163
02:05:15,553 --> 02:05:18,113
You reckon you'll ever find that
Baby Jane, or whatever her name is?

1164
02:05:18,389 --> 02:05:21,449
Sure, we'll find her.
But I guess maybe it'll be too late.

1165
02:05:58,029 --> 02:06:01,055
Oh, officer, there's a car down there
parked right out in the road.

1166
02:06:01,332 --> 02:06:03,630
I almost got stuck in the sand
when I tried to get around it.

1167
02:06:04,368 --> 02:06:06,928
- You mean that old Lincoln convertible?
- That's right.

1168
02:06:07,371 --> 02:06:10,340
That was parked there when
we opened up this morning.

1169
02:06:10,775 --> 02:06:13,141
The keys are there, but I didn't want
to move it. I thought maybe...

1170
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:16,811
How do you figure?

1171
02:06:17,081 --> 02:06:19,481
Cops. How do you figure cops?

1172
02:06:33,698 --> 02:06:34,665
This is it.

1173
02:07:06,964 --> 02:07:08,727
You must be hot.

1174
02:07:16,674 --> 02:07:18,141
Help me.

1175
02:07:19,844 --> 02:07:21,505
I'm afraid.

1176
02:07:26,617 --> 02:07:28,608
Find someone...

1177
02:07:30,021 --> 02:07:30,919
...a doctor.

1178
02:07:31,522 --> 02:07:33,183
I can't.

1179
02:07:35,793 --> 02:07:37,260
If I die...

1180
02:07:39,664 --> 02:07:40,926
...you'll be alone.

1181
02:07:41,165 --> 02:07:43,292
But they'd be mean to me,
like they were before.

1182
02:07:44,802 --> 02:07:46,667
They'll be kind.

1183
02:07:48,673 --> 02:07:50,538
I don't want to hear.

1184
02:07:52,376 --> 02:07:53,934
Jane, I'm dying.

1185
02:07:55,413 --> 02:07:57,677
There's no time.

1186
02:07:58,316 --> 02:08:00,409
You must listen.

1187
02:08:01,085 --> 02:08:02,575
I made you...

1188
02:08:03,087 --> 02:08:05,248
...waste your whole life...

1189
02:08:06,490 --> 02:08:09,050
...thinking you'd crippled me.

1190
02:08:09,293 --> 02:08:10,920
Please, stop.

1191
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:15,692
You didn't do it.

1192
02:08:18,035 --> 02:08:20,469
I did it myself.

1193
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:24,399
Don't you understand?

1194
02:08:25,977 --> 02:08:29,242
I crippled myself.

1195
02:08:30,214 --> 02:08:31,579
You weren't driving...

1196
02:08:31,682 --> 02:08:33,547
...that night.

1197
02:09:00,945 --> 02:09:03,436
You weren't driving.

1198
02:09:04,815 --> 02:09:06,806
You were too drunk.

1199
02:09:07,084 --> 02:09:09,279
I wouldn't let you drive.

1200
02:09:11,188 --> 02:09:14,055
I made you go open the gates.

1201
02:09:14,492 --> 02:09:17,154
I watched you get out of the car.

1202
02:09:18,596 --> 02:09:21,565
You'd been so cruel to me at the party.

1203
02:09:22,667 --> 02:09:24,328
Imitating me...

1204
02:09:24,869 --> 02:09:27,394
...making people laugh at me.

1205
02:09:28,205 --> 02:09:30,571
I watched you get out of the car and...

1206
02:09:32,076 --> 02:09:34,636
...I wanted to run you down...

1207
02:09:34,979 --> 02:09:36,742
...crush you.

1208
02:09:37,415 --> 02:09:39,815
You saw the car coming.

1209
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:44,513
I hit the gates.

1210
02:09:49,593 --> 02:09:52,255
Snapped my spine.

1211
02:09:53,798 --> 02:09:55,595
Then, you mean...

1212
02:09:58,602 --> 02:10:02,663
...all this time
we could've been friends?

1213
02:10:04,308 --> 02:10:08,244
You were frightened and ran away.

1214
02:10:10,181 --> 02:10:14,117
I managed to crawl out
of the car and up to the gates.

1215
02:10:14,885 --> 02:10:16,876
When they found me...

1216
02:10:17,588 --> 02:10:20,386
...they assumed it was your fault.

1217
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:26,387
Oh, you were so drunk and confused.

1218
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:28,598
You didn't know any better.

1219
02:10:32,903 --> 02:10:35,428
You weren't ugly then.

1220
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:38,872
I made you that way.

1221
02:10:40,511 --> 02:10:43,139
I even did that.

1222
02:10:45,616 --> 02:10:48,676
There's a place up there
that sells things.

1223
02:10:51,956 --> 02:10:54,117
You like ice cream.

1224
02:10:57,495 --> 02:10:59,463
I'll get you some.

1225
02:11:13,844 --> 02:11:15,334
Do you have ice cream?

1226
02:11:15,579 --> 02:11:16,443
Yes, what flavor?

1227
02:11:20,017 --> 02:11:22,451
Vanilla, coffee, strawberry, lemon...

1228
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:25,814
Strawberry. Strawberry, please.
Two big strawberries, please.

1229
02:11:35,566 --> 02:11:38,126
- That'll be forty cents.
- Thanks.

1230
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:43,164
Right. You better send some more help.

1231
02:11:53,784 --> 02:11:55,479
We've been looking all over for you.

1232
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:58,113
I'm sorry, but we must find your sister.

1233
02:12:02,493 --> 02:12:04,120
Is she down here on the beach with you?

1234
02:12:04,695 --> 02:12:06,595
- Yes, she is.
- I'll take these for you.

1235
02:12:06,697 --> 02:12:09,894
Oh, no, they're mine.
They're for my sister, Blanche.

1236
02:12:10,401 --> 02:12:12,266
She's going to be
a movie star, you know.

1237
02:12:12,903 --> 02:12:13,835
That's right, miss.

1238
02:12:14,271 --> 02:12:17,638
We want to find your sister, because
I think maybe she needs help.

1239
02:12:17,908 --> 02:12:19,239
I think maybe she's in trouble.

1240
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:21,710
Won't you show us where she is, please?

1241
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:24,707
Won't you take us to her?
Please, Ms. Hudson.
