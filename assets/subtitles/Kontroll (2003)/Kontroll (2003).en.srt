1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:04,421
The film you are about to see has
been directed by a young man,

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:08,550
who is a friend of mine, although
we haven't known each other long.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,553
As he explained it to me
during our long discussions,

4
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,349
he is particularly interested in
the struggle between Good and Evil.

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,560
What he presents
in his feature film is fiction,

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,938
a fictitious underground world.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,900
Neither the location, nor the events
that take place there,

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,696
nor the characters can be related
to the Budapest Public Transport Co.,

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,823
as they reflect ideas
of universal claim.

10
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,495
Many have warned me against letting
him shoot in the Budapest underground.

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:41,124
They were afraid that the events
and characters of the film

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,002
might discredit our company.

13
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,129
I see it differently.

14
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,050
I am proud that we've been
able to help a film director

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,470
to make his first film
by letting him use

16
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,266
the underground
with its special atmosphere.

17
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,394
I am convinced that the viewers
will be able

18
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,313
to separate the locations
from the story

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:08,193
and will not identify the characters
with our ticket inspectors

20
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:12,239
as the world in which the story is
set is obviously symbolic.

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:30,549
KONTROLL

22
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,155
Damn.

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,391
<i>Metro party</i>

24
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,826
Hey, man, you're bleeding.

25
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,845
- What did you say to me?
- Please, no trouble.

26
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,973
What did you say?

27
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,313
Ticket or pass, please.

28
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,240
What did you say?

29
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,494
I said your nose is bleeding.

30
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,055
What are you staring at?

31
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,741
- That's the sickest thing
I've ever seen. - What?

32
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,745
How can you eat that shit
this early in the morning?

33
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,789
What do you care?

34
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:58,669
I'm just saying that all
that grease is not good for you.

35
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,713
All those saturated fats are
congesting your arteries,

36
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,758
blocking the flow of blood
to and from your heart.

37
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,095
Listen, I'm heaving breakfast,
would you let me eat in peace.

38
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,973
It's your heart, you do with it
what you want.

39
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,350
That's right.
Is it any of your business?

40
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,397
No. It's none of my business
if your heart explodes.

41
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,399
It's yours, let it explode!

42
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,068
Do I give you grief for your
stinky cigarettes? No.

43
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,696
This is what you do all the time.

44
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,656
Calm down. I meant well.

45
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,367
There are people
who simply cannot be helped.

46
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,162
- He's doing it all the time... - I only
meant well, no need to overreact.

47
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,706
I'm not overreacting!

48
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,250
Don't stick your nose
into other people's shit.

49
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,045
- He gets angry and overreacts!
- Mind your own business, will you?

50
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:47,009
- Why don't you get off my back.
- Didn't I tell you? He overreacts.

51
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:51,013
You have to be the smart one.
No matter what you...

52
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,534
- What's the matter with him?
- Nothing. He's just sleeping.

53
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,412
- Let him sleep it off.
- He'll choke...

54
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,832
He won't. Leave him alone.
Let him sleep...

55
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,877
This just proves my point.

56
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,005
He's become a product
of his environment.

57
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,799
If you're surrounded
by aggressive people

58
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:32,888
- You run a risk of also becoming one.
- It's like a vicious circle.

59
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,307
Exactly. Look at Muki.

60
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,608
What's this smell?

61
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,611
Move your ass!

62
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,957
I almost had the little fucker
but he got away.

63
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,170
- He spray you again?
- Not this time.

64
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,426
- He didn't see me coming.
- Why didn't you get him then?

65
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,597
I tried. I already had him.
But he noticed me.

66
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,810
He's like the fucking devil, he's
got eyes in the back of his head.

67
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,896
- That's it?
- That's it. What did you expect?

68
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,691
Who're you talking about?

69
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:31,405
- The runner man. Bootsie!
- What's a Bootsie?

70
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,950
- How long have you been
down here? - Two weeks.

71
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,953
- And you haven't run into him yet?
- No.

72
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,125
Where's Bulcsú?

73
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,003
- Oh, shit.
- Who's this Bootsie?

74
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,381
Hang on.
Who's this Bootsie?

75
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,724
Wait! Do you hear?

76
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,640
Listen up!

77
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,185
I said, listen up!

78
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,533
Gonzó's crew: west line.

79
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,869
Tamás: upper part of the north line.

80
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:06,375
Csaba and his mates will ride
the trains on the east line.

81
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,838
Róbert will get down to business
on the west line.

82
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,926
Csaba and crew will occupy
the upper part of the north line.

83
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,263
Tamás to the upper part
of the north line.

84
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,724
- Where have you been?
- I overslept.

85
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,103
Muki?

86
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,606
Róbert, you take your men...

87
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,359
I'm sorry to disturb you.

88
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,406
Why don't you monkeys go work
the bus lines with the other losers.

89
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:44,830
You guys are on probation
so have the common fucking sense

90
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:49,459
to keep your traps shut
while I'm talking.

91
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,462
For that matter where the fuck
is Muki?

92
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:57,342
- That's just what I was asking.
- I don't need your smartass remarks.

93
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,267
Take whatever's left of your crew
and work the south line.

94
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,523
Everybody shut up.

95
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,778
We had another jumper last night.

96
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,043
The suits in the main office
are very upset.

97
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,254
That was the 7th this month.

98
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,425
The main office is concerned
how this makes the metro look.

99
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,096
It's not our fault if people want to
jump under trains and not ride them...

100
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,770
Since there is no official policy
as of yet, it's a little tricky.

101
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,356
We've been asked to help out.

102
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,656
If one of you witnesses
someone jumping

103
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:05,369
or about to jump,
try to stop him.

104
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,581
What the fuck does that mean?

105
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,377
By the way, image.

106
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:18,507
The suits have decided
to introduce a new uniform

107
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,762
to improve the standard
of elegance.

108
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,140
This is what it looks like.
No more armbands,

109
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,935
there's a detachable
shoulder strap,

110
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,521
here's the badge

111
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,316
and the ID card with the photo
goes here in the holder.

112
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:42,322
One of our crews will have the honor
to be allowed to try the new uniform.

113
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,493
And this crew is the best crew,
Gonzó's!

114
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,580
Bravo, Gonzó!

115
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,798
What are you waiting for? Get out!

116
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,232
Elite commando...

117
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,165
Laci!

118
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,294
Yes?

119
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,922
You doing all right?

120
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,676
Great, just looking forward
to getting back to work.

121
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,554
You sure?

122
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,979
Bulcsú!

123
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:03,987
What, you gonna work
from your desk?

124
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,158
Get the fuck out of here!

125
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,018
What's new, Béla?

126
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,313
How you doing, Muki?

127
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:43,360
This is a shit of a day.
And it hasn't even started yet.

128
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,447
You have something on your face.

129
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,993
- Here.
- What's this?

130
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,247
A commercial.

131
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,127
You seen my crew?

132
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,671
Just Gonzó and his guys.

133
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:07,759
Man, I don't get that asshole.
Licking his hair along the way.

134
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,471
Here he's king.

135
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:14,725
You know how he got his job?

136
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,394
Yeah.

137
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,314
I hate people like him.

138
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:27,029
More of them than there are of us.

139
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,910
Like his shit smells
better than mine.

140
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:37,873
Tell me, son. You like
the smell of your own shit?

141
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,421
I gotta find my guys.
Keep rollin' Béla.

142
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,007
Still rolling.

143
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:55,015
<i>Attention, please. Smoking is
"forbidden in the metro system".</i>

144
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,956
Get in or get out.
I don't have all day.

145
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,658
...you peel the onion,
chop it up real fine...

146
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,953
then you fry it in oil
until golden brown,

147
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,708
add some paprika, but you must be
really careful with it

148
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:30,504
because if you put it in real hot oil
it will burn and becomes bitter...

149
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:34,758
then you add the pig's trotters
and water...

150
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:38,554
I never thought there were
jobs worse than ours.

151
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:44,977
...and you top it up with water
in the end to make it nice and juicy.

152
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,065
Don't look, son.

153
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:08,750
Never mind. You can even
piss on me if you like.

154
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:16,091
Go ahead, puke over my shoulder.

155
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,095
We'll discuss this later.

156
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,019
Here comes the Gestapo.

157
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,898
I didn't know what was missing.

158
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,775
I'll tell them a little bird
shat all over me.

159
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,586
You?

160
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:59,009
- We were about to work the train.
- And? Did you see what happened?

161
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:03,055
- We heard some screams. - Then
what the hell are you doing here?

162
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,016
You guys want to talk to them?

163
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,917
- You think he heard me?
- Who? - The paramedic.

164
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,921
- What do you care if he heard you.
- It could always get worse.

165
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,424
- How's that?
- You could be the jumper.

166
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,932
Muki's here.

167
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,475
Good morning.

168
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:57,109
You skipped the bufe
this morning again.

169
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,654
- I overslept. - Overslept!
I tried to call you last night.

170
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,447
I was out.

171
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:08,412
"I was out." Good for you.
Did you have to pay for it?

172
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,667
What?

173
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,920
Ticket or pass.

174
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,505
Not buying anything, thanks.

175
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,134
You guys are so useless
you should have to pay to ride.

176
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,556
Hey, Bulcsú. We 'railing' tonight?

177
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,607
Is that a challenge?

178
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,028
Yeah. You a pussy?

179
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:46,700
No. I've done it there times, man.
You're the cherry.

180
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,123
Interesting you should say that
'cause I've never seen you do it.

181
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:57,044
- It's just a rumor.
- I've seen him do it.

182
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,797
In your dreams, Sleeping Beauty.
Go take a snooze, you freak!

183
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,716
Fuck you, monkey boy...

184
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,384
Fuck you...

185
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,429
Monkey!

186
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,806
When?

187
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,228
Tonight.

188
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,898
- You pick the track.
- No,

189
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,109
you go ahead.

190
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:27,115
How about the East line, platform 5.
That's the longest run.

191
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,495
Done.

192
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,880
Asshole baboons!

193
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,052
Idiots!

194
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:07,281
- Listen. What's railing?
- Listen, Tibor. We have to talk.

195
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,158
Okay, okay.

196
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:14,621
- So you puked on my shoes, right?
- Oh, I'm really sorry about that...

197
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:26,800
- You paying attention? What's so
funny? - No, I'm listening.

198
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:36,018
- I wanna say something. - Go away.
- Just one word. - Go away.

199
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,396
- What did you do before this?
- This morning?

200
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,357
Not this morning, before you came
here, came down here.

201
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:45,861
- What did you do before?
- Oh, this is my first job.

202
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,906
Hang on. Just one word.

203
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:53,744
I didn't say anything...
anything that...

204
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,793
Stupid idiot.
I didn't say anything nasty.

205
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,724
When is that fucking train coming?

206
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:24,274
- You know what it all boils
down to? - No.

207
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:30,822
Persistence, discipline,
and above all, self control.

208
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,910
You're wearing it upside down.

209
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:39,498
By the way, put it on
inside the train, okay?

210
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,334
Sorry.

211
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,770
The worm's coming.

212
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,675
Where's he going?

213
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:25,521
Good morning,
tickets or passes please.

214
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:26,813
Hello.

215
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:41,745
Good morning,
tickets or passes please.

216
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:47,125
- This... this is not important...
- Pardon? - Not important, not now.

217
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,465
- Tickets or passes...
- I haven't got one.

218
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:59,847
No-no-no. Ticket! Ticket!

219
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,229
Stop pulling my leg!

220
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:11,900
- You're in some real serious shit.
- Am I?

221
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:17,156
If you haven't got a ticket or any
money on you, I'll give you a check.

222
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,867
Ticket! Ticket...!

223
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:32,254
I'm much too tired to start
playing the lottery now.

224
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,048
- Listen to me... - They'll
hear you... - Who'll hear me?

225
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:37,634
Don't condescend me.

226
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,597
I see you're this big.

227
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:54,234
I meant well,
I'm telling you what to do.

228
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:58,489
- Give me your ID card.
- Leave me alone. Let me go.

229
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,366
Good morning,
tickets or passes please.

230
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,703
Leave me alone.
Say good-bye and move on.

231
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,706
- Tickets or passes please.
- Move on, I said.

232
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:13,045
They want it all... And you
don't know that in the morning...

233
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,923
Are you a cop?
An insurance agent?

234
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,467
- Oh, God...
- A gangster? Here.

235
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,513
- What ticket? -You haven't got one?
- No. - Then you'll pay a fine.

236
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:26,767
Thank you.
Tickets or passes please.

237
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:32,064
Good morning.
Good morning.

238
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,566
Tickets or passes please.

239
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,361
Hang on, I have it,
what is it, stupid.

240
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:38,904
- I don't care.
- But you do.

241
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:48,372
Don't take a picture.
You have a group rate or not?

242
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:51,750
- This is the wrong zone, my friend.
- So it is.

243
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:55,587
Does it say anywhere that this
is a sleeping car?

244
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:59,216
- Does it?
- Would you like it to be?

245
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,719
Your sweater is cute,
you little frog!

246
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,638
Let's see your ticket, then...

247
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,765
Fine, but the problem is,

248
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,393
- I haven't got a pen.
- I haven't got a pen, either.

249
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,145
What was that?

250
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,606
Here, take one of the girls.

251
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,862
I don't want the girls, show me
your ticket or pass or get off.

252
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,488
Are you really such an idiot?

253
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,866
- Give me your ID card!
- But what kind of zone?

254
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,701
Don't give me that shit.
Give me your ID card.

255
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:29,663
- But what kind of zone?
- Shut up.

256
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,083
- What zone? - Shut up, shut up,
I said. Give me your ticket.

257
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,378
- You're so cute.
- Stop pushing me you fucking bitch.

258
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:40,632
- I love it when you're so tough...
- Stop it or I'll be rude to you!

259
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:45,554
Stop pushing me, are you crazy?
Go fuck yourself you bloody bastard.

260
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:49,016
What are you pulling me about
for you fucker?

261
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:53,896
I don't understand. Do you know
what this means? This?

262
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:56,398
I'm the control.

263
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,986
- Idiot.
- Shithead.

264
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:06,325
- What is it? What's so funny?
- You like that?

265
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:09,703
Why didn't you tell me you were
a cop? Why?

266
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,122
You're the boss?

267
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,501
- I'm just a small boss...
- Come off it, look at you...

268
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,879
- You don't have a pen?
- I can't have everything.

269
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:22,716
Is that how you leave home?
No money, no pen, no ticket...

270
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,969
- Should I bring a secretary with me?
- Just make sure she has a ticket.

271
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:30,265
- You rotten informer. - What
informer? What are you talking about?

272
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,768
- Who are you watching, eh?
- And you?

273
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:37,940
Really, you want to fuck with me?

274
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:43,070
- Tickets or passes please.
- See? Your mate digs it. Go on!

275
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,738
Clever!

276
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,668
Fuck. Hold your dog.

277
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,129
Make it fucking lie down.

278
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:13,684
If I ever get down from here
I'll bite its head off, I swear.

279
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,353
Put it on. Put it on.

280
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:21,066
Excuse me...!

281
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,610
Young lady...!

282
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,076
Is it safe?

283
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,252
It is forbidden to bring dogs here.

284
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,462
Your ticket!

285
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:46,675
- Ticket or passes, please.
- Oh, yes... yes...

286
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:57,186
I'll help you. "Tickets or passes!"

287
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:04,276
- You're new to this crew,
aren't you? - What?

288
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:08,989
- I said, you're new to this brigade,
I haven't seen you... - What?

289
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,534
You guys don't usually say
excuse me.

290
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,628
But exceptions prove the rule.

291
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:29,885
Besides, I never buy a ticket.

292
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,644
Did the bear have a ticket?

293
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:40,938
Yeah.

294
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:45,692
- Who are you?
- My name's Bootsie.

295
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:52,491
Fuck you...
I'm blind! I'm blind!

296
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:01,375
You motherfucker.

297
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,133
Come on!

298
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,970
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

299
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,139
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right. Take a shortcut!

300
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:17,850
You sure?

301
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:21,144
Are you sure you're all right?
Tibor!

302
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,662
Where the hell can they be?

303
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,739
Watch out, I can't stop...

304
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:18,619
Are you deaf, God damn it?

305
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,027
Catch him.

306
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,625
Hello, listen...

307
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:55,132
- You hear? Listen!
- I hear you, pudding face.

308
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:21,658
The damned thing about it is
that we didn't stand a chance.

309
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:27,414
We're just like the first class
detective guys, damn it.

310
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,042
And that's it.

311
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:34,004
I know it's a terrible shame
buy I wet my pants, guys.

312
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:37,007
I'm going home...

313
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,928
Fucking hell...

314
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,309
It won't hurt so bad tomorrow.

315
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:52,814
How the fuck am I going to explain
it to the company doctor?

316
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:02,699
It's broken... look... it's dead.

317
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,795
Listen...

318
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,927
What's railing?

319
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,393
I'm off.

320
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,606
Wait, wait.

321
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,717
I told you that faggot was
all talk.

322
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:18,358
He ain't gonna show.

323
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:22,070
- What was that?
- He ain't gonna show.

324
00:39:56,438 --> 00:40:01,026
- I thought I'd see you here tonight.
- I'd never miss this show.

325
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,405
This is C, this is Tibi,
one of the new guys.

326
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,418
Hang on. You hear?

327
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,712
Listen, wait...

328
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,801
What's C?

329
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:28,512
It's my name.

330
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:34,351
We can still call this off.

331
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:37,896
Fuck you.

332
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,570
- But what does it stand for?
- Cripple.

333
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:47,698
Cripple.

334
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:56,748
- Gonzó... - Try your mind
fuck on someone else, you goon.

335
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,628
- Your laces. - What?
- Your laces are undone.

336
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:06,592
Cripple. What a fucked up name.

337
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:08,886
It's just a nickname.

338
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,930
Why did you get a name like that?

339
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:16,810
Because I haven't got any toes
on my left foot.

340
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:23,150
You born that way?

341
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:27,905
No.

342
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:36,288
We should get into the last car.

343
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:28,298
Listen, tell me, what's all this?

344
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:33,011
- What did Bulcsú tell you?
- Nothing.

345
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,889
That it's some kind of race.

346
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:39,226
More like Russian roulette.

347
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:46,150
And where are they right now?

348
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:52,406
Somewhere behind us.
Running behind the train.

349
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:58,203
The second our train pulled out,
they jumped onto the tracks

350
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,914
and started to run after us.

351
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:04,376
It's not easy because the ground is
covered with tubes and cables

352
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,044
and the tracks are there, too.

353
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:09,715
Your lungs fill with graphite powder
and you can't breathe.

354
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,885
The problem is the next train.

355
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:17,306
Wait, wait, wait...

356
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:22,394
- This is the last train.
- The last passenger train.

357
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:26,106
We still have
the midnight express behind us.

358
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:33,906
The midnight express. What's that?

359
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:36,325
It's the real last train.

360
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:40,287
It's the last train
that heads back to the depot.

361
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,916
- So you're saying...
- That's right.

362
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,669
They got another train
coming from behind.

363
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:50,964
The real problem is
that the midnight express

364
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:54,510
doesn't stop at any stations.

365
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:56,803
Hang on. And who wins?

366
00:43:56,887 --> 00:44:00,224
What do you think?
Whoever comes out first.

367
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,360
Listen man, what now?

368
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:18,116
We smoke a cigarette.

369
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,717
Give me a cigarette.

370
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:21,013
DANGER, ENTR Y PROHIBITED

371
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:43,785
Holy shit!

372
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,538
Shit!

373
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:51,710
You're king! You're king!

374
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,852
I'm going home.

375
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:13,106
What?

376
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,567
Bulcsú!

377
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,276
Wake up!

378
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,368
- What are you doing here?
- I wanna show you something.

379
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,371
Come.

380
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:56,770
Come!

381
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:55,329
What did you want to show me?

382
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,338
There.

383
00:51:57,034 --> 00:52:00,162
Will you sit down? Please.

384
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:04,082
Thank you. That's really kind of you.

385
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:51,338
- Excuse me, good morning, lady.
- Good morning.

386
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:55,509
- Ticket or pass, please. - Get lost,
I'm busy. - Hang on! Excuse me.

387
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:59,930
- Good morning.
- I don't fucking believe this.

388
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:04,518
I can't believe you find me again.
Can't you see we're on a job?

389
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:09,356
- The dog's ticket, please.
- Don't you ever point at the dog.

390
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,653
Come on, Professor,
what's the matter?

391
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:17,614
Nothing,
I'm just checking if it's okay.

392
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:22,161
What the fuck do you have to
look at it? It's not okay.

393
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:26,165
Let me see, okay?
Don't tell me if it's okay or not.

394
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,417
Of course, it's not.

395
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,586
- Leave me alone.
- Lady. I'm just doing my job.

396
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,756
Fuck you and your job.
Who the fuck cares about your job?

397
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,344
- Your dog's supposed to be muzzled.
- What are you talking about?

398
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:43,432
You're dog's not allowed to ride
the metro without a muzzle.

399
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:45,392
This is an international story...

400
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:49,563
Look at the photo or don't you
know how to look at a photo?

401
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:52,441
Like this.
No date.

402
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:58,197
Thanks for your help. Teach me
what to do with the passengers?

403
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,410
- You want me to call the cops?
- I'll tell them you touched me. Yes!

404
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:06,497
- I'll tell them you grabbed my tits.
- What?

405
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,333
Yeah.
I'll tell them you grabbed my tits.

406
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:14,379
Here, you little punk.
Suck my ass you faggot.

407
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:17,674
Same to you, too, madam.
And have a nice day.

408
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,596
- I can't believe that I can't get it
out. - Why can't you get it out?

409
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:24,932
You might as well
keep it in a bank vault.

410
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:29,228
Look at this. D'you think I don't buy a
ticket because I haven't got the cash?

411
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,897
Why, then don't you buy a ticket?

412
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:36,485
On principle. I'm not going to carry
pieces of paper on me.

413
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:39,571
This is how you fucking take it out.

414
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:44,201
- Like this, see?
- You're incredible.

415
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:46,578
This is yours.

416
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:51,166
Okay. 5 minutes with the little one.
In peace and quiet.

417
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,878
She'll do it happily, she enjoys it,
I swear, that's no bullshit.

418
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:57,798
I don't want the girl.
I want your ID card.

419
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:02,553
- Take it out, take a look...
- That's what I'm doing.

420
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:06,557
Here. I told you it wasn't okay.

421
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,853
By the way, he hasn't put
his name on it.

422
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:14,106
- Trying to cheat.
- No, there's no name on it.

423
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:19,069
- What's this?
- It's my p... p-p... p-p...

424
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:26,034
- I asked you a simple question.
- I... I... I...

425
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:29,329
Not this year. Fucking hell, no.
Last year.

426
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:32,291
Who was operated on
last year? You or I?

427
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:35,377
- Excuse me...
- Just a moment,

428
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,215
don't be so impatient,
we're on a job here.

429
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:44,678
- Stop.
- Shut up! I'll call my husband.

430
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:50,017
Call your hubby. Send him over.
Send God over. I'm king here.

431
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,979
I'll bite his head off throat
if he doesn't have a ticket.

432
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:56,398
Tickets or passes, please.

433
00:55:57,149 --> 00:56:00,486
That's an ancient trick.
Your ticket please.

434
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:02,905
Tibor, you mustn't lose control.

435
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:06,158
This little shit grabbed me, there!

436
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:14,041
- What now?
- Chill out, I'll talk... I'll talk to him.

437
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:18,003
- Chill out, let's discuss it.
- Shut up and scram!

438
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:21,298
- What's the matter with you?
- There-there-there...

439
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:23,258
- I know it's your pass.
- I... I... I...

440
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:25,302
It's not good here.

441
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:30,557
Your name?
What's your name?

442
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,726
What's your name?

443
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:39,858
But... but... but...

444
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:46,990
- What do you want with a pass
that's no good here? - Back... back...

445
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:49,535
Here... on the back...

446
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:51,078
Tickets or passes please...

447
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:54,373
Leave me alone.
I have to catch the train.

448
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:58,627
- Madam, I'll call the cops.
- I'll put such a curse on you.

449
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:02,297
- Okay, but give me your ticket.
- Shall I put a curse on you?

450
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,178
Ticket or pass, please.

451
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:10,806
Please, show me your ticket...

452
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:13,267
I'm patient...

453
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:17,146
Are you fucking crazy?
Are you messing with me?

454
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:21,275
This... this... this... is... my...

455
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,903
It's people like you
who make me crazy!

456
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:29,283
Stop fucking with me!
Get outta here!

457
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:34,204
I'll cut off your hand
and stick it up your ass!

458
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:37,166
Tickets or passes, please...

459
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,335
- Excuse me, sorry...
- Nerd.

460
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:44,339
It's people like you
that make this job so tough!

461
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:50,637
It's people like...

462
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:58,103
It's the grease.
Animals don't eat grease.

463
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:00,105
Or at least not this much.

464
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:02,316
Dirty job.

465
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:09,656
- Sorry.
- Sorry...

466
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,660
Let's put him
on the bench over here.

467
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,693
- What's up?
- Bulcsú...!

468
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:51,615
Bulcsú!
You don't remember me? Sorry.

469
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:54,117
- Hello, Feri...
- Hi.

470
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:57,412
You look horrible.
I haven't seen you for ages.

471
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:02,793
- I think that guy's talking to you.
- No.

472
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:06,213
He is a ticket control officer.
I haven't got a ticket. Do you?

473
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:09,758
No. They just like to harass people.

474
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:14,888
- You okay? You just seem anxious.
- No.

475
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:16,890
Okay, then.

476
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:20,227
- You getting on this one?
- No, the other one...

477
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:24,064
Never mind, I have some time.
I'll ride with you so we can catch up.

478
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:26,316
Yes, great...

479
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:36,076
- So where did you disappear to?
You been abroad? - What?

480
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,204
Working? Or just traveling?

481
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,211
- Yeah, working, traveling.
- Man, that must be great.

482
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,924
- So you working there?
- Where?

483
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:54,511
- What do you mean where?
Abroad... - No.

484
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:59,016
So you're here in the city?
I'm just asking because

485
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:02,811
I haven't heard your name
floating around lately.

486
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:12,946
- How about you?
- Me?

487
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:19,203
I'm the head of the team.

488
01:00:19,995 --> 01:00:22,915
Congratulations.
I mean it.

489
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:26,710
It was easy to get without you there.

490
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:30,839
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

491
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:34,426
- It's none of my business, if you...
- No... no...

492
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:38,847
...if you don't want to talk
about it, that's cool.

493
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,642
Your project... your work...

494
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:45,187
There hasn't been anything
close since then.

495
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:51,026
I have all of it,
I saved every scrap of paper.

496
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:53,821
Why?

497
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:57,157
In case you came back.

498
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:02,788
It would change things for sure,
turn everything upside down...!

499
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,920
Why didn't you finish it?

500
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:15,676
When for years
you wake up that...

501
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:19,137
you have to win
every battle every day...

502
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:22,724
to prove that you are
the best at everything...

503
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:26,979
I started to worry what
would happen if it turned out

504
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,523
I wasn't the best.

505
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,484
I didn't want to be worry...

506
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,908
It's a pity you didn't finish it.

507
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:48,500
You know where to find me.
Think about it.

508
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:51,253
- I like your tie.
- Thanks.

509
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:56,425
- Think about it.
- It was good to see you.

510
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,760
Good to see you, too.

511
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:41,428
You don't have to bring me lunch
every day.

512
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,556
I like it.

513
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:48,977
I like coming down here.

514
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:07,913
- Dad?
- Yes?

515
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:12,459
Do you think I'm weird?

516
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,798
Fortunately, yes.

517
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:22,052
No... I'm serious.

518
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:26,098
Take your time.

519
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:42,990
I hated this job anyway...

520
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:47,578
You'll find a better one.
A much better one.

521
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:58,797
You look like an angel.

522
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:05,804
You should of seen me in my prime.

523
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:33,684
Excuse me.

524
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:38,981
Laci, help... Laci... I'll bring help...

525
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:53,996
Say something to him.

526
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:16,059
I stepped him off the train
and he socked me.

527
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:21,148
- I see. Don't let him get you
into trouble. - I didn't start it.

528
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:24,860
I believe you. I didn't say you did.
Just don't fuck up.

529
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:30,407
I asked for his ticket and he hit me.
He hit me for no reason.

530
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:36,788
He socked me in the nose.

531
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:40,542
Listen, I know, just...
leave him alone.

532
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:47,174
I'm sick of it all.

533
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,483
Having dinner, Uncle Béla?

534
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:13,779
Bulcsú...! Hi!
What are you doing here?

535
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:16,323
- What are you doing here?
- Me?

536
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:20,828
I'm a night owl.
Come, have a bite. A Béla plate...

537
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,206
Thank you...

538
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:32,214
Thanks...

539
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:35,801
Cucumber, tomato, apple, onion...

540
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,596
Onion.

541
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,683
Thank you.

542
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:03,036
A guy goes into a bar and orders
ten shots of brandy.

543
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,873
The barman asks him.
'Ten, sir? '

544
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:08,792
'Give them to me, ' the guy says.

545
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:12,004
- Do you know it?
- No.

546
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:15,674
The barman pours the ten shots
of vodka

547
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:18,677
and lines them up on the counter.

548
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:23,432
The guy takes the first
and the tenth one,

549
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:26,894
picks them up and pours them
out on the floor.

550
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:30,689
He drinks the remaining eight,
one after the other.

551
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:34,193
The barman asks with surprise:

552
01:10:34,276 --> 01:10:37,654
'Why did you pour those two
shots out on the floor? '

553
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,826
'Look, sonny, the first one
always tastes horrible

554
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:47,498
and the last
one always makes me sick. '

555
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:57,758
Does it hurt that bad?

556
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:01,553
Horribly.

557
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:05,599
I've never heard
such a bad joke before...!

558
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,854
Béla joke.

559
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,196
- Want to hear another one?
- No. No, thanks.

560
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:30,415
Go on eat.

561
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,011
Eat...

562
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:54,565
Thank you very much.

563
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,987
Don't go.

564
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:16,086
How can you get out of here,
uncle Béla?

565
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,966
There are many ways out, Bulcsú!

566
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:46,969
Iván Kapitány!

567
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:48,846
Here.

568
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:55,477
- I've never been to a psychiatrist.
- There's really nothing to it.

569
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:59,356
I don't like the idea of someone
messing around inside my head.

570
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,859
You needn't worry.

571
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:05,070
Can't make waves
if you don't have any water.

572
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:08,115
- What?
- Nothing.

573
01:14:19,376 --> 01:14:22,796
The disease is called narcolepsy.

574
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,800
So when a conflict comes,

575
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:30,345
...when I wake up
I just don't know what happened.

576
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:36,894
I have this recurring dream
that in the other world

577
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:41,565
all the people I ever fined
are torturing me

578
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:44,651
with red hot iron and pincers.

579
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:47,863
I don't do any more
what the others do...

580
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,866
a bottle hidden
in the water tank in the lavatory.

581
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:55,162
I take it with me, portioned out
nicely, this is just one little mouthful.

582
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:57,247
They sneer at you...

583
01:14:57,372 --> 01:15:02,044
I enrolled in a yoga course,
meditations and suchlike...

584
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:04,505
I've lost my femininity...
everything...

585
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:08,175
Shouldn't you prescribe glasses
against these neon lights?

586
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:13,847
When I'm in the manic phase
I simply charge at them.

587
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,058
What's this?

588
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:18,936
I checked if he had a ticket...

589
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:22,231
He was so charming,
so good looking.

590
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:26,109
And he smiled back at me so cutely,
I was really surprised...

591
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:28,654
that he smiles at a ticket inspector.

592
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:32,366
Probably that's not what he saw
in me, the inspector, but the woman.

593
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:33,992
I need something.

594
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:36,286
I don't know what all these idiots
expect me to do...

595
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:37,830
I haven't had a fuck
for two months...

596
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:39,873
What do you mean
trespassers will be prosecuted?

597
01:15:39,957 --> 01:15:41,667
Why did you leave
your pass at home?

598
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,586
Elbow hits, knee hits,
then on the head and that's it.

599
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:49,800
My brother and I are always
competing at everything.

600
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:53,470
On the football field,
everywhere.

601
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:56,849
We are in a band,
both of us, but...

602
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:01,103
He is on the drums, I do the keyboard
but still we are competing.

603
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:06,400
I don't get it. Miklós is always
giving me shit,

604
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:13,031
in the band he plays all instruments,

605
01:16:13,282 --> 01:16:15,409
he is driving me crazy.

606
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:18,704
I'm scared.

607
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:20,414
I'd like to screw someone.

608
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:26,253
I wanted to breed dogs...

609
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:28,547
I was admitted finally...

610
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:57,034
Excuse me...
Doc... hey, wait...

611
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:01,788
How much?
I'll buy it, okay?

612
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,849
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

613
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:23,894
Relax!

614
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:31,401
- What happened?
- Self defense.

615
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:35,239
- We don't beat up passengers.
- She kicked me in the nuts.

616
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:39,284
- Only after you grabbed me.
- You're a psycho bitch.

617
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:42,538
I'll take care of this...

618
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:45,123
I'm reporting this, Bulcsú.

619
01:17:45,624 --> 01:17:49,336
What are you going to report?
That a teddy bear attacked you?

620
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:52,172
Teddy bear?
She is an aggressive animal.

621
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:54,049
Behind me.

622
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:55,676
Come!

623
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:59,054
Margit!

624
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,432
Where were you?

625
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:26,415
You! You want to go up
and get a coffee?

626
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:38,677
You're working. I understand.

627
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:46,518
- I know a nice place close by.
- What?

628
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:51,398
- A nice place down here.
- Now I can hear you.

629
01:18:57,821 --> 01:19:00,407
I'll buy you coffee.

630
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:03,118
Okay.

631
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:27,518
Sugar?

632
01:19:30,187 --> 01:19:33,941
Nice place.
Come here often?

633
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,403
Only when I really want
to impress a girl.

634
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:46,453
Thanks.

635
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:55,712
You like working down here?

636
01:19:57,673 --> 01:20:00,384
You kind of get used to it.

637
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:08,433
I never thought about it.

638
01:20:09,226 --> 01:20:11,395
What?

639
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:16,358
It must be tough for you guys.

640
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,572
Everyone hates us.

641
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:25,450
Now that's a little paranoid,
you know...

642
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:29,246
No that's the way it is.
Everyone hates us.

643
01:20:35,586 --> 01:20:39,006
Why don't you ever buy a ticket?

644
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:44,011
Why I never buy a ticket?

645
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:47,055
Because I don't have to.

646
01:20:47,139 --> 01:20:50,642
My father's a metro driver.

647
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,485
Who's your father?

648
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:03,739
I'm sure you know him. Béla.

649
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,496
You're Béla's daughter?

650
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:15,459
Yeah. Why?

651
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:20,088
I really like Béla.

652
01:21:23,801 --> 01:21:26,345
Can I ask you something?

653
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:32,768
Is it true he used to drive
trains up top?

654
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:37,272
Yeah.

655
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:40,859
Is it true he crashed a locomotive
in Keleti station?

656
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:43,570
Yeah. No one was hurt though.

657
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:56,124
- Inadequate braking distance.
- It happens.

658
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,210
It does.

659
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:02,923
So there's a costume ball
tomorrow night. I saw some posters.

660
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:08,303
- Are you coming?
- No.

661
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:12,224
I mean I'll be down here
but I won't be dressing up.

662
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:14,685
Why? That's the whole point.

663
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:17,771
I'm funny enough without a costume.

664
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:26,697
Who are you hiding from?

665
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:41,128
You wanna meet tomorrow?

666
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,259
Yeah.

667
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:50,804
You gonna take me to the ball?

668
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:01,815
Hello.

669
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,944
Good evening.

670
01:27:57,194 --> 01:28:01,615
Suits from the main office
have come looking for you.

671
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,090
Sit down.

672
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:21,635
Do you have any requests
before we start?

673
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:26,348
May I have a glass of water?

674
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:35,774
What happened this afternoon?

675
01:28:37,693 --> 01:28:40,821
Look at the tapes.

676
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:43,907
We did.

677
01:28:51,582 --> 01:28:55,085
This isn't just about
your job any more.

678
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:57,754
You realize that, don't you?

679
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:08,599
If you refuse to answer
our questions

680
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:14,188
we will be forced
to work out our own version.

681
01:29:15,898 --> 01:29:19,276
And what is your version?

682
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,490
Switch it on.

683
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:33,332
This moment you're still
running after the kid.

684
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:36,001
But the next moment...
Iook...

685
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,715
the kid is already lying
on the tracks.

686
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:47,012
That's bullshit. Half of it
was omitted, you know that.

687
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:50,724
Switch it off.

688
01:29:55,395 --> 01:30:01,735
There are 300 million people
traveling on this metro a year...

689
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:07,115
You fucking bastard.

690
01:30:07,991 --> 01:30:11,453
Do you think I'll let you
cross my path?

691
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:17,251
- I didn't push them. - So you admit
that you know they were pushed?

692
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:21,046
- Who pushed them?
- I don't know.

693
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:24,341
But I do. You did.

694
01:30:46,572 --> 01:30:50,450
Why have you been sleeping
on the platforms?

695
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:52,828
None of your business.

696
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:56,456
So you refuse to answer
my question

697
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:00,544
why you have been sleeping
on the platforms.

698
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:05,257
You spend 24 hours
a day down here,

699
01:31:06,842 --> 01:31:10,929
which would give you excellent
opportunities to learn

700
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:16,351
when the cameras are on
and where they are placed.

701
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:22,524
You're out of your mind.
If you think I killed those people

702
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:25,360
then where are the police?

703
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:29,114
- Why haven't I been arrested?
- All in good time.

704
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:33,410
Bullshit. You've got nothing.
I won't be your scapegoat.

705
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:37,080
You don't have permission to leave.

706
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:40,626
I don't need it.
I don't work for you any more.

707
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:43,545
Stop!

708
01:31:45,047 --> 01:31:47,341
Stop!

709
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:59,228
What's going on, Bulcsú?
What did they ask you?

710
01:31:59,311 --> 01:32:01,146
Nothing.

711
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:05,108
- We're your crew. We deserve
an explanation. - Not any more.

712
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:07,736
If those bastards made you quit,
we can fight it.

713
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:11,824
No need. They didn't fire me.
I quit. I've had enough.

714
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:15,828
- What are you going to do now?
- Wander around the system?

715
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:19,081
Maybe push somebody
onto the tracks?

716
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:23,043
- What are you talking about?
- That's what this is all about!

717
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:26,630
The suits think all the jumpers
have been pushed

718
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:29,842
- And Bulcsú has pushed them.
- That's fucking crazy.

719
01:32:29,925 --> 01:32:31,093
- Is it?
- It is.

720
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:34,930
Who thought Laci
could slit a man's throat?

721
01:32:36,557 --> 01:32:39,726
Over the last few weeks
you've missed the bufe.

722
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:42,771
'I overslept'. I called you
last night, 'I was out.'.

723
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:46,525
You've been lying to us, because
you're wandering day and night

724
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:49,444
around the system, like some
crazy homeless person.

725
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:52,156
What else have you been lying about?

726
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:54,950
I don't even know
who you are any more.

727
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:59,288
- What do you want from me?
- Answer the question. Is it true?

728
01:33:00,706 --> 01:33:03,041
Did you push them?

729
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:21,286
Bulcsú!

730
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,461
I'm happy to see you, man.

731
01:34:42,349 --> 01:34:45,477
Gonzó! Gonzó!

732
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:48,897
You fucking idiot.

733
01:34:50,566 --> 01:34:54,194
What have you done?
You, you beast!

734
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:02,202
Bulcsú.

735
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:25,517
We'll sit down on the bench.

736
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:35,202
Get the fuck out of here.

737
01:45:29,454 --> 01:45:31,582
Look!

738
01:46:34,812 --> 01:46:37,981
