1
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,115
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,038
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,756
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,074
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,314
Stand by.

6
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,557
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,875
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,757
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,914
Sir.

10
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,158
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,474
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,989
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,031
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,436
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,552
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,394
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,592
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,711
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,276
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,951
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,437
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,711
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,548
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,115
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,869
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,110
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,391
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,317
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,276
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,235
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,754
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,031
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,629
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,230
We'd better go.

35
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,478
R2, wait.

36
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,197
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,471
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,435
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,072
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,350
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,356
Oh, my!

42
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,228
Oh, no.

43
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,519
Oh, my.

44
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,038
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,716
And a gift.

46
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,113
What gift?

47
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,954
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,988
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,596
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,752
Good morning.

51
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,956
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,197
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

53
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,514
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

54
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,349
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

55
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,679
<i>I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...</i>

56
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,315
<i>and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.</i>

57
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,068
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

58
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,234
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...</i>

59
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,998
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

60
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,679
<i>and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

61
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,756
<i>As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift...</i>

62
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,552
<i>these two droids.</i>

63
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,476
What did he say?

64
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,990
<i>Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.</i>

65
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,715
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,758
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,955
There will be no bargain.

68
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,196
We're doomed.

69
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,998
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

70
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,716
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,350
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,913
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,875
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,668
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,238
How horrid!

76
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,193
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,834
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,790
I am C-3PO...

79
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,591
Yes or no will do.

80
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,153
Well, yes.

81
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,668
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,269
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

83
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,913
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,236
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,077
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,712
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,075
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,269
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,596
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,075
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,071
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,554
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,831
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,553
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,230
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,999
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,274
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,236
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,472
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,827
Yes?

101
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,596
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,187
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,155
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,831
"50,000. No less."

105
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,873
What did I say?

106
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,514
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,549
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,751
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,352
fearless and inventive.

110
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,119
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,309
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,197
He agrees!

113
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,709
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,354
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,670
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,077
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,351
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,077
Who are you?

119
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,234
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,510
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,791
What's that?

122
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,237
I know that laugh.

123
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,188
Hey, Jabba.

124
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,038
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,913
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,588
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,236
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,670
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,069
Look...

130
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,276
Take him away.

131
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,071
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,588
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,470
Bring her to me.

134
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,316
We have powerful friends.

135
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,589
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,196
I'm sure.

137
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,832
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,239
Chewie?

139
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,836
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,188
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,070
What's going on?

142
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,032
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,549
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,156
AJedi knight?

145
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,628
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,757
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,038
I'm all right.

148
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,711
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,590
No bargain.

150
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,075
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,077
You serve your master well.

152
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,790
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,436
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,913
Master.

155
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,877
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.

156
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,073
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,917
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,679
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,313
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,432
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,869
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,548
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,750
Nevertheless...

164
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,712
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,515
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,472
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,631
Master Luke, you're standing on...

168
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:39,151
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,710
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,988
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,994
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,159
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,394
Han.

174
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,872
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,308
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

176
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,000
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,509
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,398
Oh, dear.

179
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,198
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,231
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,917
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,708
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,069
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,394
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,669
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:01,509
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,597
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,076
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,758
You should have bargained, Jabba.

190
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,795
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

191
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,877
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,991
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,876
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,719
You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.

195
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,035
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,390
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,468
Great.

198
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,515
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,587
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,518
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,551
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,512
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,111
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,596
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,711
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

206
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,988
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,953
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,119
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,753
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,597
Right?

211
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,750
This is your last chance.

212
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,871
Free us or die.

213
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,833
Move him into position.

214
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,190
Put him in.

215
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,038
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,999
Help!

217
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,596
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,838
Han, Chewie!

219
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,949
Lando.

220
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,993
Boba Fett?

221
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,313
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,070
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,519
I'm trying!

224
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:23,068
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,430
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,713
Gently, now.

227
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,796
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,558
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,557
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,590
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,199
A little higher!

232
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,150
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,719
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,992
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,398
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,356
Quickly, R2!

237
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,829
Beast!

238
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,751
Get the gun!

239
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,074
Point it at the deck.

240
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,878
Point it at the deck!

241
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,954
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

242
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,358
Come on.

243
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,434
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,032
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,673
<i>Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.</i>

246
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,360
<i>- I will.
- Luke, thanks.</i>

247
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,597
<i>Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.</i>

248
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,389
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,710
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,717
to an old friend.

251
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,199
Rise, my friend.

252
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,757
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,909
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,637
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,353
Yes, my master.

256
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,634
Patience, my friend.

257
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,956
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,311
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

259
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,635
He has grown strong.

260
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,197
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,992
As you wish.

262
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,393
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,512
That face you make...

264
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,994
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,791
No, of course not.

266
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,717
I do.

267
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,597
Yes, I do.

268
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,068
Sick have I become.

269
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,077
Old and weak.

270
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,391
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,271
Iook as good you will not.

272
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,916
Soon will I rest.

273
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,032
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,157
Earned it I have.

275
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,840
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,920
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,916
but not that strong.

278
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:15,434
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,797
That is the way of things...

280
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,956
the way of the Force.

281
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,597
But I need your help.

282
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,757
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,916
No more training do you require.

284
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,032
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:42,190
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,431
Not yet.

287
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,471
One thing remains...

288
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,711
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,438
Then... only then...
a Jedi will you be.

290
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,155
And confront him you will.

291
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,039
Master Yoda...

292
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,949
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,349
Rest I need.

294
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,833
Yes.

295
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,518
Rest.

296
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,235
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,469
Your father he is.

298
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,954
Told you, did he?

299
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,958
Yes.

300
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,914
Unexpected this is.

301
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,193
And unfortunate.

302
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,876
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,228
No.

304
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,074
Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...

305
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,634
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,036
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,518
I'm sorry.

308
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:23,958
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,472
But beware.

310
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,989
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,634
the dark side are they.

312
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,909
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,635
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,271
Do not...

315
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,552
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,909
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,155
When gone am I...

318
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,958
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,193
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,036
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,197
There is...

322
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,911
another...

323
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,072
Skywalker.

324
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,197
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,228
I can't go on alone.

326
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,429
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

327
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,628
Obi-Wan.

328
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,918
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,748
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,159
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,034
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,592
When that happened...

333
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:28,757
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,068
So what I told you was true...

335
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,952
from a certain point of view.

336
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,434
A certain point of view?

337
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,268
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,197
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,554
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,992
When I first knew him...

341
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,190
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,789
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,708
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,594
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:03,947
I was wrong.

346
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,677
There is still good in him.

347
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,438
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,436
twisted and evil.

349
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,235
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,190
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,436
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,233
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,318
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,469
You were our only hope.

355
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:35,755
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:40,188
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:42,956
But I have no sister.

358
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:45,871
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,436
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,914
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,588
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,153
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,353
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,588
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,592
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:15,994
They do you credit...

367
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:19,077
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,277
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,152
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,112
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,275
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,996
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,838
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,672
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,148
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,315
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,157
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,429
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,393
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:24,952
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,876
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,956
But most important of all...

384
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,670
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,835
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,315
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:41,438
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,153
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,195
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,552
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,036
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

392
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,474
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,070
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,074
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,193
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,117
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,072
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,717
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,068
Good luck.

400
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:36,516
You're gonna need it.

401
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,277
General Madine.

402
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,077
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:46,239
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,956
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,273
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,594
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,597
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,476
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:04,590
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,748
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,710
I'm with you too.

412
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,998
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,594
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,034
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,911
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:47,518
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:50,916
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:53,269
All right, old buddy.

419
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,311
I know what she means to you.

420
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,989
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,592
All right?

422
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:02,947
Right.

423
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,027
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:14,230
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,034
Good luck.

426
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:18,592
You too.

427
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,237
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,269
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:47,036
Hey, you awake?

430
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:50,469
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:54,795
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,117
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:00,356
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,518
Here we go again.

435
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:16,911
All right, hang on.

436
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,949
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,190
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,471
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,679
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,710
It is of no concern.

441
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,552
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:00,398
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:03,079
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,030
Yes, my master.

445
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:23,032
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:27,760
<i>We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.</i>

447
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,909
<i>Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.</i>

448
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,239
<i>Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.</i>

449
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,952
Transmission commencing.

450
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,958
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,110
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,510
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,391
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:58,635
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,115
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,675
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,516
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,554
<i>Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?</i>

459
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,436
<i>Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.</i>

460
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,074
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,989
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:29,996
I was about to clear them.

463
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,789
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,114
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,878
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,079
Shall I hold them?

467
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:54,873
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,195
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:00,155
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,757
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,438
<i>Shuttle Tydirium...</i>

472
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:11,835
<i>deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.</i>

473
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,155
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

474
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,668
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,914
No problem.

476
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,916
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,030
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,038
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,954
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,639
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,079
Hey...

482
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:23,427
it's me.

483
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,911
Go for help! Go!

484
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:51,472
Great. Come on!

485
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,277
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,474
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:16,599
Hey, wait!

488
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:24,994
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

489
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,672
Move closer.

490
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:41,438
Get alongside that one.

491
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:23,195
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,311
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,188
Where's Leia?

494
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:50,349
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,869
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,911
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:57,996
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:01,713
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:05,195
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:28,836
Cut it out.

501
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,990
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,280
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:01,394
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,277
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,117
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,036
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,108
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:22,998
That's right.

509
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:29,358
Come on.

510
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,079
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:52,077
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:00,795
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,358
What is it?

514
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,588
Freeze!

515
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:48,835
Come on. Get up.

516
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:55,753
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,474
What the...

518
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,307
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:03,353
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,550
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:12,717
Yes, I know.

522
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:16,315
My son is with them.

523
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,356
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,148
Strange that I have not.

525
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:32,673
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,438
They are clear, my master.

527
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:39,632
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,637
He will come to me?

529
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,030
I have foreseen it.

530
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:51,039
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:54,914
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:57,159
As you wish.

533
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,193
Master Luke.

534
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,398
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:27,351
And I found this.

536
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,998
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,878
I hope she's all right.

538
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:42,708
What, Chewie?

539
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,032
What, Chewie?

540
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,190
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,797
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:11,559
Nice work.

543
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,032
Great, Chewie.

544
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:17,150
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,317
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,077
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

547
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:23,599
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,793
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,831
It's a very long drop!

550
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,797
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:24,228
Hey!

552
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,715
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:35,074
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:38,637
Oh, my head.

555
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,438
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,791
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,273
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,073
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

559
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,757
What are you telling them?

560
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,911
"Hello," I think.

561
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:28,952
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...

562
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:32,470
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,912
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,792
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,078
Proper?

566
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:48,713
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,033
Why, you...

568
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,353
My mistake.

569
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,877
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,238
Hey.

571
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,074
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:10,752
What did he say?

573
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,109
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:16,595
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

575
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:35,675
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,471
These are my friends.

577
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:44,479
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,596
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,474
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,476
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

581
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,875
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

582
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,479
Tell them.

583
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,751
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,393
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,747
Wait.

586
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:44,837
What's happening?

587
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,677
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,279
Somebody!

589
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:54,673
Somebody help!

590
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,394
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,158
Thank goodness.

592
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,591
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,676
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,359
...Tatooine...

595
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,029
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:01,519
...Darth Vader!

597
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,192
...Death Star.

598
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:11,229
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,396
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,675
Master Luke...

601
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:32,550
<i>...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.</i>

602
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,154
...Vader!

603
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:38,354
Han Solo...

604
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:41,838
...carbon.

605
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:44,554
...Sarlacc.

606
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:08,038
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:23,800
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:26,957
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:40,475
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,952
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:50,957
Good. How far is it?

612
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:52,637
Ask him.

613
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,836
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,791
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:01,355
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,556
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:10,710
Leia, do you remember
your mother...

618
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,796
your real mother?

619
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,275
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:18,230
What do you remember?

621
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:20,828
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,472
Tell me.

623
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:27,032
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:29,673
Kind... but sad.

625
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,432
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,914
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,831
I never knew her.

628
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,630
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:51,988
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,198
How do you know?

631
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:57,150
I felt his presence.

632
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:01,277
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:03,197
That's why I have to go.

634
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:06,630
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,472
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,077
He's my father.

637
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,439
Your father?

638
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,514
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,359
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

640
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:31,912
Don't talk that way.

641
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:36,351
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,390
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,271
You have that power too.

644
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:43,596
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:50,189
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,511
My father has it.

647
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,676
I have it.

648
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,073
And...

649
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:01,595
my sister has it.

650
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,631
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,238
I know.

652
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,518
Somehow...

653
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:24,672
I've always known.

654
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,676
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,029
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:34,356
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,596
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,596
You've always been strong.

659
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,034
But why must you confront him?

660
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,708
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,751
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,872
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:54,957
I have to try.

664
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,551
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:19,430
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,318
Nothing?

667
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:25,871
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,909
I can't tell you.

669
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:36,993
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:55,677
I'm sorry.

671
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:00,877
Hold me.

672
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,796
This is the rebel that surrendered.

673
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,717
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,434
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:03,073
He was armed only with this.

676
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,637
Good work, Commander.

677
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,591
Leave us.

678
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,234
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,311
Yes, my lord.

680
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,115
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:21,792
I know, Father.

682
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:25,470
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,956
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:33,152
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,559
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:38,877
I know there is good in you.

687
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,514
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:47,435
That was why
you couldn't destroy me.

689
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:50,873
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,752
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

691
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,073
Your skills are complete.

692
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:16,470
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:22,912
Come with me.

694
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,672
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,515
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,279
I must obey my master.

697
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:40,595
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,387
If that is your destiny.

699
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,149
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,793
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,275
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:02,511
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,109
He is your master now.

704
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,309
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,390
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,430
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:22:58,279 --> 01:23:01,750
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,872
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,438
What's he saying?

710
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,756
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:39,430
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:42,157
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:45,675
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,796
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,354
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:58,588
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:04,029
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,037
All right. Stand by.

719
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,876
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,752
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,439
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,948
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:50,469
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,478
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,636
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,796
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,949
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:26,271
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

729
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:28,755
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,916
I have decided that we shall stay here.

731
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,515
Hey!

732
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:06,712
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,069
I have been expecting you.

734
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:11,957
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,997
Guards, leave us.

736
01:27:26,119 --> 01:27:29,430
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:34,429
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,914
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:39,076
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,515
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,472
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,798
about a great many things.

743
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,997
His lightsabre.

744
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:01,635
Ah, yes. AJedi's weapon.

745
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:04,708
Much like your father's.

746
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:09,435
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,279
So will it be with you.

748
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:14,355
You're wrong.

749
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:17,438
Soon I'll be dead...
and you with me.

750
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,877
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,033
Yes.

752
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:32,074
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,953
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:39,072
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,956
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:54,073
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:57,271
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:28:57,399 --> 01:29:01,551
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:05,788
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,195
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:29:09,319 --> 01:29:13,198
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:17,393
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,395
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,514
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,194
All right!

766
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:34,752
Up! Move!

767
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,279
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,158
Han, hurry.

769
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:44,077
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,869
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,671
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:56,078
Wait! Come back!

773
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:00,198
R2, stay with me.

774
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,757
Freeze!

775
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,877
You rebel scum.

776
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,990
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:33,157
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,036
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,595
May the Force be with us.

780
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,917
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield... up or down.

781
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,079
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

782
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:54,592
if we're coming.

783
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:58,076
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:30:58,199 --> 01:31:00,190
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:02,390
<i>Pull up! All craft pull up!</i>

786
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,507
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:14,918
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:16,472
It's a trap.

789
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,796
Fighters coming in.

790
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:26,394
There's too many.

791
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,831
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,948
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:38,672
Come, boy.

794
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,396
See for yourself.

795
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:48,953
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:31:49,079 --> 01:31:52,755
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,029
You want this...

798
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,596
don't you?

799
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:07,032
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,869
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,671
Use it.

802
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,676
I am unarmed.

803
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,596
Strike me down with it.

804
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,154
Give in to your anger.

805
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:24,074
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

806
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:32,355
It is unavoidable.

807
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:35,435
It is your destiny.

808
01:32:36,439 --> 01:32:39,431
You, like your father...

809
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,118
are now...

810
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,557
mine.

811
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,189
All right, move it.

812
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,438
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:15,430
Were you looking for me?

814
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,676
Bring those two down here.

815
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,118
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,514
Freeze.

817
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:32,708
Don't move.

818
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,671
We surrender.

819
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,997
The code's changed.

820
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:39,395
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,430
R2, where are you?

822
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,436
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:46,872
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,078
Going where, R2?

825
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:54,238
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:55,952
Come back!

827
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,837
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,757
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,551
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,318
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:41,992
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:47,948
Pressure's steady.

833
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,911
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:05,997
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:09,157
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:37:09,279 --> 01:37:12,430
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,390
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:19,953
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:23,197
your friends have failed.

840
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,234
Now witness the firepower...

841
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:31,479
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,033
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,398
Fire.

844
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,194
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,350
That thing's operational.

846
01:37:55,479 --> 01:37:57,231
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:37:57,359 --> 01:37:59,350
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:37:59,479 --> 01:38:01,595
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,359
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

850
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:07,631
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,309
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:30,712
We're coming.

853
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:37,634
Come on.

854
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:42,599
R2, hurry!

855
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:49,310
My goodness!

856
01:38:55,159 --> 01:38:57,070
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:02,554
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,078
I'll cover you.

859
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,314
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:49,033
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:39:49,159 --> 01:39:52,435
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,073
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,350
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:01,434
She's gonna blow!

865
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:06,872
I'm hit!

866
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,909
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:17,918
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:22,429
There is no escape...

869
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,073
my young apprentice.

870
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:29,555
The Alliance will die...

871
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:34,078
as will your friends.

872
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,787
Good.

873
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,877
I can feel your anger.

874
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,916
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:51,032
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:40:51,159 --> 01:40:55,471
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:41:33,159 --> 01:41:35,115
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,551
I think I got it.

879
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,873
I got it!

880
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,108
Are you all right?

881
01:43:35,239 --> 01:43:37,037
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:38,387
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,953
Don't move.

884
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,833
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,234
Hands up.

886
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:50,469
Stand up.

887
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,319
Stay back.

888
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,514
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,391
No, wait.

890
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,033
I got an idea.

891
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,313
Good.

892
01:44:27,439 --> 01:44:31,069
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,793
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:42,676
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,274
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,472
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

897
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:30,708
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:33,832
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

899
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,314
There is no conflict.

900
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,476
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,476
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

902
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:46,957
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:45:47,079 --> 01:45:48,832
If you will not fight...

904
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,427
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:03,588
Good.

906
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,073
Good.

907
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:16,869
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,073
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,518
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,231
Don't let me down.

911
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,998
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

912
01:46:34,119 --> 01:46:36,350
<i>The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.</i>

913
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:38,913
<i>We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.</i>

914
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,837
Send three squads to help.

915
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,837
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:46:57,439 --> 01:46:58,792
Throw me another charge.

917
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:18,313
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,350
I will not fight you.

919
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,631
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:33,038
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

921
01:47:34,039 --> 01:47:35,677
Yes.

922
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,676
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,234
Your feelings for them are strong...

924
01:47:40,359 --> 01:47:42,157
especially for...

925
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:45,832
sister.

926
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:51,192
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:54,868
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,912
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:03,238
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:08,309
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:11,113
then perhaps she will.

932
01:48:11,239 --> 01:48:12,115
Never!

933
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,518
Good!

934
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:04,274
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:10,195
Now, fulfil your destiny...

936
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:14,233
and take your father's place at my side.

937
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,953
Never.

938
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,949
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,519
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,516
I am a Jedi...

941
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,595
like my father before me.

942
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:55,189
So be it, Jedi.

943
01:49:55,399 --> 01:49:57,197
Move! Move!

944
01:50:09,319 --> 01:50:13,029
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:50:13,159 --> 01:50:16,755
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,711
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,073
If you will not be turned...

948
01:50:28,199 --> 01:50:31,396
you will be destroyed.

949
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:39,792
Young fool.

950
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:43,434
Only now, at the end...

951
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,356
do you understand.

952
01:50:58,039 --> 01:51:03,557
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:51:07,239 --> 01:51:10,914
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:18,032
Father, please!

955
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,789
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:38,591
you will die.

957
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,359
I'm going in.

958
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:03,548
Here goes nothing.

959
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:14,069
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

960
01:53:16,199 --> 01:53:19,510
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

961
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,470
Split up and head back to the surface.

962
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:39,636
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

963
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:40,670
Copy, Gold Leader.

964
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,073
That was too close.

965
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,989
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

966
01:53:58,119 --> 01:54:01,032
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

967
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:08,956
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

968
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:11,957
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

969
01:54:14,359 --> 01:54:16,032
Intensify forward firepower!

970
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:18,948
Too late!

971
01:55:02,199 --> 01:55:05,908
Help me take this mask off.

972
01:55:06,039 --> 01:55:07,837
But you'll die.

973
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:12,036
Nothing can stop that now.

974
01:55:13,079 --> 01:55:14,637
Just for once...

975
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,118
let me...

976
01:55:17,239 --> 01:55:20,550
Iook on you with my own eyes.

977
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:59,518
Now go, my son.

978
01:56:01,159 --> 01:56:02,512
Leave me.

979
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:05,914
No. You're coming with me.

980
01:56:06,039 --> 01:56:08,270
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

981
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:12,668
You already have, Luke.

982
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,596
You were right.

983
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:18,590
You were right about me.

984
01:56:20,439 --> 01:56:22,158
Tell your sister...

985
01:56:23,159 --> 01:56:25,275
you were right.

986
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:33,114
Father.

987
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:38,554
I won't leave you.

988
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:03,914
There it is.

989
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:09,034
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

990
01:57:09,159 --> 01:57:12,310
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

991
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:33,752
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

992
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:20,631
They did it!

993
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:31,069
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

994
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,511
He wasn't.

995
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,231
I can feel it.

996
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,233
You love him.

997
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:46,872
Don't you?

998
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,399
Yes.

999
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:51,113
All right. I understand.

1000
01:58:51,239 --> 01:58:52,559
Fine.

1001
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:55,278
When he comes back...

1002
01:58:56,319 --> 01:58:57,992
I won't get in the way.

1003
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,476
It's not like that at all.

1004
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:08,270
He's my brother.

1005
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:47,278
Wesa free!
