2
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:31,946
is a many splendoured thing

3
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,945
I'm going back to Australia,
I might never see you again.

4
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,114
Don't talk that way, Sandy.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,783
But it's true.

6
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:20,537
I've just had the best summer of my life
and now I have to go away.

7
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:22,164
It isn't fair.

8
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,007
Danny, don't spoil it.

9
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:35,426
It's not spoiling it, Sandy,
it's only making it better.

10
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:38,138
Danny, is this the end?

11
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,473
Of course not.

12
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,893
It's only the beginning.

13
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,061
This is the main brain,
Vince Fontaine.

14
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,897
Beginning your day with the only way,
music, music, music.

15
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:49,691
Get out of bed,
it's the first day of school.

16
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,985
Don't be a slob, don't get a job.
Go back to class, you can pass.

17
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,695
And to start the day off nice and fine,

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,490
I'm gonna play
a new old favourite of mine.

19
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:00,786
I solve my problems and I see the light

20
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,079
We got a loving thing

21
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,373
We got to feed it right

22
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,794
There ain't no danger we can go too far

23
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,716
We start believing now
that we can be who we are

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,093
Grease is the word

25
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,307
They think our love
is just a growing pain

26
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,602
Why don't they understand?

27
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,563
It's just a crying shame

28
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:32,067
Their lips are lying, only real is real

29
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,485
We stop the fight right now

30
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,697
We got to be what we feel

31
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,323
Grease is the word

32
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,075
Is the word, is the word that you heard

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,371
It's got groove, it's got meaning

34
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:47,915
Grease is the time

35
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,752
is the place, is the motion

36
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:54,463
Grease is the way we are feeling

37
00:02:57,718 --> 00:03:01,096
We take the pressure
and we throw away

38
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,808
Conventionality belongs to yesterday

39
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,854
There is a chance
that we can make it so far

40
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:14,401
We start believing now
that we can be who we are

41
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,860
Grease is the word

42
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:18,989
Is the word, is the word that you heard

43
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,116
It's got groove, it's got meaning

44
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,621
Grease is the time

45
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:28,497
is the place, is the motion

46
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:32,752
Now grease is the way we are feeling

47
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:36,173
This is a life of illusion

48
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,508
Wrapped up in troubles

49
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,301
Laced in confusion

50
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:43,805
What are we doing here

51
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,558
We take the pressure
and we throw away

52
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:52,355
Conventionality belongs to yesterday

53
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,526
There is a chance
that we can make it so far

54
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,989
We start believing now
that we can be who we are

55
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,449
Grease is the word

56
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,786
Is the word
is the word that you heard

57
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,122
It's got groove, it's got meaning

58
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:12,459
Grease is the time

59
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,294
is the place, is the motion

60
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,839
Grease is the way we are feeling

61
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:37,817
Grease is the word
is the word that you've heard

62
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,528
It's got groove, it's got meaning

63
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,490
Grease is the time

64
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:46,994
is the place, is the motion

65
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,747
Grease is the way we are feeling

66
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,920
Grease is the word
is the word, is the word

67
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,851
You're not supposed to eat this,
you're supposed to bury it.

68
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,185
Hey, that's a homemade lunch.

69
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,062
Old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

70
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,524
Sure, Putzie. She does it every year
on the first day of school.

71
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,983
Big deal.

72
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,487
- Kenickie! Over here, Kenickie.
- Kenickie.

73
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,574
- Hey, where you at?
- We're right here.

74
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,994
- Where were you all summer?
- What are you, my mother?

75
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,245
I'm just asking.

76
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,956
I was working, which is more than
any of youse kids can say.

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,540
- Working?
- That's right.

78
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,834
I was lugging boxes
at Bargain City, moron.

79
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:39,211
- Nice job.
- Eat me.

80
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,465
- I'm saving up to get me some wheels.
- Yeah?

81
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,091
- You wanna hear what I did?
- No.

82
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,425
Hey, there's Danny!

83
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,264
- Hey, Danny!
- Danny! Danny!

84
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,810
- Hey, hey!
- How you doing, huh?

85
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,353
Hey, Danny!

86
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,487
Hey, you seen any new broads
over there?

87
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,406
Nah, just the same old chicks
everybody's made it with.

88
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,035
Hey, so what'd you do all summer,
Danny, huh?

89
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,829
I was hanging around down the beach,
you know. You know.

90
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:15,831
I know what you mean, it's tough with
all those chicks hanging around you.

91
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,918
Yeah, well, the only thing that
hangs around you, Sonny, are the flies.

92
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:20,545
Hey, right here, Putzie, huh?

93
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:24,007
Hey, how was
the action at the beach, man?

94
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,384
Ooh!

95
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,302
- It was flipping.
- Yeah? Crazy?

96
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:32,391
I did meet this one chick.
She was sort of cool, you know.

97
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,683
You mean she puts out?

98
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,896
Oh, come on, Sonny,
is that all you ever think about?

99
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,398
Freaking A!

100
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:43,985
Hey, guys, wait up.

101
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,028
Do I look okay, Frenchy?

102
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:49,115
- Sure, you look good.
- I'm really nervous, you know.

103
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,076
- You look terrific.
- So, this is Rydell?

104
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,538
Yep, you'll love it.

105
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:58,250
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

106
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,002
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

107
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,504
Why? You got psoriasis?

108
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,396
Oh, God.

109
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,608
Well, here we are again.

110
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,694
Yeah, but this time we're seniors.

111
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,237
And we're gonna rule the school.

112
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:33,201
- Jan, that is so adolescent.
- We are adolescent.

113
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,077
We don't have to flaunt it.

114
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,745
Okay, girls.

115
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,206
Let's go get them.

116
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,090
Blanche, do you have
the new schedules?

117
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,884
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

118
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,678
Oh, good, they'll be nice and smudged.

119
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:54,598
Oh, here we are.

120
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:57,308
If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

121
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,228
Blanche, these are the schedules
we couldn't find for last semester.

122
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,483
Now, maybe next year,
you'll find the ones for this semester.

123
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,074
I've got Kenickie again.

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,119
He's been here longer than I have.

125
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:20,165
It's the first day of school
and already my castor oil is missing.

126
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,127
How many days till Christmas vacation?

127
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:26,420
- Eighty-six.
- Eighty-six?

128
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,882
- I'm counting.
- Oh.

129
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,550
- May I help you, dear?
- Oh, yes, this is my first day of school.

130
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,260
I'm not really sure
where I'm supposed to be.

131
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,179
Oh, well, welcome to Rydell.

132
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,265
You'll have to fill out
a few of these forms, but...

133
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,269
Will you excuse me for a minute?
I'll be right back.

134
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,813
Oh, excuse me,
do you have a pencil, please?

135
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,274
Oh, yes, dear. There you are.

136
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:59,788
Jeez. Every teacher I got
this year has flunked me at least once.

137
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,038
If you don't watch it,

138
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,041
you're gonna be spending all your time
in McGee's office.

139
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,251
Yeah, well, this year she's gonna wish
she'd never seen me.

140
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,211
Oh, yeah? And what are you gonna do?

141
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,837
I just ain't gonna take any of her crap.

142
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,216
That's all,
I don't take no crap from nobody.

143
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,842
- Sonny?
- Oh, hello, ma'am.

144
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,971
Aren't you supposed to be
in Homeroom right now?

145
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:17,221
I was just going for a walk.

146
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,599
- You were just dawdling, weren't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:23,394
That is no way
to start a new semester, Mr. LaTierri.

148
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,816
Perhaps a session
of banging erasers after school

149
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,275
would put you on the right track.

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,693
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,653
Are you just going to
stand there all day?

152
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,780
No, ma'am. I mean, yes, ma'am.
I mean, I'm just...

153
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,033
- Well, which is it, yes or no?
- No, ma'am.

154
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:39,411
- Good. Then move.
- Yes, ma'am.

155
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:44,624
I'm sure glad
you didn't take any of her crap, Sonny.

156
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,543
You would've really told her off, huh?

157
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,587
"Mr. LaTierri.
Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am."

158
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,215
- Hey, Eugene.
- How you doing?

159
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:53,758
Shake, buddy.

160
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:58,429
Hey, what's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

161
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,599
- I got astigmatism.
- Oh, too bad.

162
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,057
Come on, let's go.

163
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,565
As I go travelling down life's highway

164
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:13,028
Whatever course
my fortunes may foretell

165
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,536
Good morning, boys and girls,
and welcome to what we're sure will be

166
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,871
our greatest year at Rydell.

167
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,333
Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire,

168
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,629
and I want to see all of you students
out there with plenty of support

169
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:34,633
for Coach Calhoun
and the Rydell Rangers.

170
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,886
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

171
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:42,182
And now for the really good news

172
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:44,768
and probably
one of the most exciting things

173
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,144
to ever happen at Rydell High.

174
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:51,982
National Bandstand television show
has selected Rydell

175
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,693
as a representative
American high school

176
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,782
and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

177
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,701
It is our chance to show

178
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:05,913
the entire nation what fine,
bright, clean-cut,

179
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,501
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

180
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,897
Hey, did you guys get a look at Zuko
this morning?

181
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,942
Looking pretty good this year, huh, Rizz?

182
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,192
That's ancient history.

183
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,778
Well, history sometimes repeats itself.

184
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,407
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi, Frenchy.

185
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,865
- Hi, French.
- Go sit down.

186
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,827
This here is Sandy Olsson.

187
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:48,248
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this here's Rizzo.

188
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:51,167
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

189
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,043
How are things down under?

190
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,879
Oh, fine, thanks.

191
00:11:57,006 --> 00:12:00,342
- Hey, Marty, are those new glasses?
- Oh, yeah, just got them for school.

192
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,052
Don't you think
they make me look smarter?

193
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,556
Nah, you can still see your face.

194
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,057
How do you like school so far, Sandy?

195
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,976
- It's different.
- Hi, kids.

196
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:13,565
Patty Simcox,
the bad seed of Rydell High. Hi!

197
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,817
Oh, I just love the first day of school,
don't you?

198
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,192
It's the biggest thrill of my life.

199
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:18,820
Oh, you'll never guess what's happened.

200
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,028
Probably not.

201
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,947
They just announced the nominees
for Student Council

202
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,700
and guess who's up for Vice President?

203
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,994
- Who?
- Me. Isn't that the most?

204
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,455
- To say the least.
- The very least.

205
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,456
I just hope
I don't make too poor a showing.

206
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,834
Well, we certainly wish you
the best of luck, don't we, girls?

207
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,668
Yeah, sure. I've got my fingers crossed.

208
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,336
- Thank you.
- Here.

209
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:40,424
Oh, you must think I'm a terrible clod
for not introducing myself to your friend.

210
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,677
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

211
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,386
Welcome to Rydell.

212
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,769
Well, I hope you'll be
at cheerleader tryouts.

213
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,230
We'll have so much fun
and get to be lifelong friends.

214
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:56,899
You guys, how do you like Sandy, huh?

215
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,195
Do you think we could let her in
the Pink Ladies?

216
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,739
She looks too pure to be pink.

217
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,407
Oh, double doo-doo!

218
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,741
- Please.
- What's up, Doc?

219
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,870
One of my diamonds
just fell in the macaroni.

220
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,123
Hey, Kenickie,
you want a piece of salami?

221
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,708
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

222
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,628
What a stink!

223
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,671
Hey, guys. Guys, look.

224
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:23,842
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade!

225
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,177
Yeah.

226
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,474
Hey, look! You really put your foot
into it this time, Chisum.

227
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:32,100
Try hopscotch, you hot dog!

228
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:35,897
- What a gavone.
- Gumdrops, man.

229
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,735
Hey, any of you guys
see that new chick at registration?

230
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:45,072
Oh, she sure beats the foam domes
around here.

231
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:46,950
You mean her jugs
were bigger than Annette's?

232
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,284
Nobody's jugs are bigger than Annette's.

233
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,620
Right.

234
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,042
Hey, guys.

235
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:57,918
Hey!

236
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,755
Hi, girls.

237
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:04,591
- You're a sick man, Putz.
- Hey!

238
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,514
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

239
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,014
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

240
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,267
Nah, it was nothing.

241
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,644
- Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?
- Come on, Danny.

242
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:15,979
You got in her drawers, right?

243
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,063
Yeah, come on, come on.
Tell us about that girl.

244
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,107
What'd you do this summer, Sandy?

245
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,318
Oh, I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

246
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,072
Hauled your cookies
all the way to the beach for some guy?

247
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,198
Well, he was sort of special.

248
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,451
There ain't no such thing.

249
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,245
He was really romantic.

250
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,455
- Everything about it.
- Come on, man.

251
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,749
Come on, you don't want to hear
all the horny details.

252
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,959
Are you kidding me!

253
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,626
All right! I'll tell you.

254
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:43,463
Summer lovin'
Had me a blast

255
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:47,342
Summer lovin'
Happened so fast

256
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,014
I met a girl crazy for me

257
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:54,642
Met a boy cute as can be

258
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,437
Summer days drifting away

259
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,190
To uh-oh those summer nights

260
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,150
Well-a well-a well-a huh!

261
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,193
Tell me more, tell me more

262
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,988
Did ja get very far?

263
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,615
Tell me more, tell me more

264
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,490
Like does he have a car?

265
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:14,870
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo,
doo-doo doo-doo-doo

266
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:18,332
She swam by me, she got a cramp

267
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:22,253
He ran by me, got my suit damp

268
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:26,381
I saved her life, she nearly drowned

269
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,927
He showed off, splashing around

270
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:33,306
Summer sun, something's begun

271
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,017
But uh-oh those summer nights

272
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,101
Well-a well-a well-a huh!

273
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,104
Tell me more, tell me more

274
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:41,980
Was it love at first sight?

275
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,982
Tell me more, tell me more

276
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,777
Did she put up a fight?

277
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,364
Dam, doo-bee-doo, doo-bee-doo,
doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bee

278
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,701
Dam, doo-bee-doo, doo-bee-doo,
doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bee-dam

279
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:57,080
Took her bowling in the arcade

280
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,250
We went strolling, drank lemonade

281
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:04,962
We made out under the dock

282
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,591
We stayed out till ten o'clock

283
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,135
Summer fling, don't mean a thing

284
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,640
But uh-oh those summer nights

285
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,809
Tell me more, tell me more

286
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,687
But ya don't gotta brag

287
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,022
Tell me more, tell me more

288
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,899
'Cause he sounds like a drag

289
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,028
Shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop,
shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop

290
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,655
Shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop,
shoo-bop-bop

291
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,240
Yeah

292
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:36,952
He got friendly holding my hand

293
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:41,039
She got friendly down in the sand

294
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,793
He was sweet, just turned eighteen

295
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,336
Well, she was good

296
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,715
Ya know what I mean

297
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,801
Summer heat, boy and girl meet

298
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,763
But uh-oh those summer nights

299
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,640
Tell me more, tell me more

300
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,600
How much dough did he spend?

301
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,562
Tell me more, tell me more

302
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,939
Could she get me a friend?

303
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,609
It turned colder

304
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,320
That's where it ends

305
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,576
So I told her we'd still be friends

306
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,249
Then we made our true love vow

307
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,630
Wonder what she's doing now

308
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,552
Summer dreams

309
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:40,182
ripped at the seams

310
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,311
But uh-oh

311
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,526
those summer

312
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,405
nights

313
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,661
Tell me more, tell me more

314
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,797
He sounds real nice.

315
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,882
True love
and he didn't lay a hand on you?

316
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,424
Sounds like a creep to me.

317
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,885
Well, he wasn't. He was a gentleman.

318
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,887
Hey, what was his name?

319
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,640
Danny. Danny Zuko.

320
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:26,061
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

321
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,772
Well, maybe, if you believe in miracles,

322
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:31,567
Prince Charming
will show up again someday.

323
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,486
Somewhere unexpected.

324
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,445
See you later.

325
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,905
Come on, girls.

326
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,076
Do you really think so, Frenchy?

327
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:43,203
- Sure.
- Yeah?

328
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,915
Sandy, I think we ought to get to class.

329
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:09,771
Do the splits,
give a yell!

330
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,816
Show a little spirit for old Rydell!

331
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,109
Way to go, red and white!

332
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,737
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight!

333
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,580
And now...

334
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,709
Quiet, please.

335
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,840
Quiet, everyone. And now,
boys and girls, the man of the hour.

336
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:38,843
The coach we're all depending on

337
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:42,512
to pull Rydell out of
the seven-season slump,

338
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:45,432
our very own Coach Calhoun.

339
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,193
Who's the best?

340
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,569
Rydell!

341
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:02,282
Give them hell, Rydell!

342
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,038
I just wanna tell you students
that we have a banner year coming up,

343
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,539
a banner year.

344
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,209
Because my boys are primed.

345
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:14,628
I mean really primed
because I primed them.

346
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:17,214
I mean, they're not only primed,
they're honed.

347
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,925
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

348
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,553
And we're not
just going out there to win,

349
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:25,222
we're going out there for glory.

350
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,057
When we get out there,

351
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:31,144
we're gonna yank them
and tear them and rip them!

352
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,147
We're gonna take them
and roll them around

353
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,483
and rip them up to pieces!

354
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,237
And then we're gonna slaughter them.

355
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,324
And after the slaughter is over,
we're gonna come back here

356
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,160
and ring that victory bell.

357
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,498
Like we always wanted to.

358
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,307
Doody! Doody!

359
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,480
Hey, Dan, watch this.

360
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:20,528
Do a split, give a yell,
shake a tit for old Rydell!

361
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,032
Guys.

362
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,661
Be cool, huh?

363
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,999
Hey, watch out, pinhead.

364
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:39,462
Well, what do you think?

365
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,215
What a hunk of junk.

366
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,135
Wait till I give it a paint job
and soup up the engine, man.

367
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,221
She's gonna run like a champ.

368
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,056
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

369
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,391
Thunder Road?

370
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,393
Yeah. You wanna
make something of it?

371
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,563
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

372
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,981
You're cruising for a bruising.

373
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,902
Hey, what're the Scorpions doing here?
This ain't their turf.

374
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,740
Think they wanna rumble?

375
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,491
Yeah, if they do,
we're gonna be ready for them.

376
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,085
All right, gang! Let's go get them!

377
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,846
Hey, chick.

378
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,722
What you doing?

379
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,184
- Oh, thanks, Frenchy.
- That's all right.

380
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,269
You know something?
You were really great out there.

381
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,271
No, I really messed up,
I was so nervous.

382
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:40,775
Oh, no. Your split was divoon.

383
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,361
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.

384
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,695
- We got a surprise for you.
- Surprise? What is it?

385
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,280
You'll see. Right, Rizz?

386
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,616
Hey, just let me comb
your hair down a little bit here.

387
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,285
Where are we going?

388
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,203
Want a little lipstick?

389
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:57,625
You know, if we fix up this car, it
could be make-out city, you know that?

390
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,961
Right, a chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in.

391
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,546
You'd better believe it, man.

392
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,465
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

393
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,134
Oh, yeah?

394
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:09,303
Yeah.

395
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,640
Sandy!

396
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:14,392
Danny?

397
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,061
What are you doing here? I thought
you were going back to Australia.

398
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:20,146
We had a change of plan.

399
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:21,648
I can't...

400
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,487
That's cool, baby.
I mean, you know how it is.

401
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,405
Rocking and rolling and whatnot.

402
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,325
- Danny?
- That's my name, don't wear it out.

403
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,742
What's the matter with you?

404
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:36,247
What's the matter with me, baby?
What's the matter with you?

405
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,251
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

406
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:45,756
Well, I do not know.
I mean, maybe there's two of us, right?

407
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,094
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad,

408
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:52,846
or try the Yellow Pages? I don't know.

409
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,269
You're a fake and a phoney
and I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

410
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,356
- I wonder if she carries silver bullets.
- Yeah.

411
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:08,528
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

412
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,449
Hey, I bet that's not all
she's laid on him.

413
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:14,617
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, Zuk! I got a car, remember?

414
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:17,288
- Come on, Danny.
- All right, who's got beer money?

415
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,289
- Well, I swiped my brother's ID.
- I got $2.50.

416
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,125
All right, give me that.

417
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,047
He was so nice to me
this summer.

418
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:30,718
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

419
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,556
Listen to me. They're fleas on rats.

420
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:39,727
Worse than that,
they're amoebas on fleas on rats.

421
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:43,564
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

422
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,902
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

423
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,489
- You know what you need?
- What?

424
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,325
A night out with the girls. Huh?

425
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,578
We're having a sleepover
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

426
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,915
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

427
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,419
Hey, look, it's Jan.

428
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:08,756
Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Get the new Ipana

429
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,009
With the brand-new flavour
It's dandy for your teeth

430
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,346
Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
New Ipana toothpaste

431
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,266
Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Knocks out decay germs fast

432
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,852
Fast, fast, you sure are right

433
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,270
Turn it off.

434
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:27,691
- Hey. Hey, hand me a ciggie butt.
- Oh, me, too. Over here.

435
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,152
- Hey, you want one, Sandy?
- No, thanks, I don't smoke.

436
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,239
- You don't?
- Go ahead, try it. It won't kill you.

437
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,199
Give her a Hit Parade.

438
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:43,457
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

439
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,292
Sandy, let me teach you
how to French inhale.

440
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,503
It's really cool, watch.

441
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:55,051
God! That is the ugliest looking thing
I ever saw.

442
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:57,471
Nah, the guys really go for it.

443
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,557
And that's how I got my nickname,
Frenchy.

444
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,182
Sure it is.

445
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,519
- Oh.
- Okay.

446
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:07,439
Okay, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party going?

447
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:11,818
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

448
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,445
Hey, I brought some Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

449
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,199
Twinkies and wine?
Oh, that's real class, Jan.

450
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,411
It says right here it is a dessert wine.

451
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:23,329
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

452
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:24,789
Oh, that's okay.

453
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:27,125
I bet you never had a drink before either.

454
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,961
Oh, yes, I did. I had some champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

455
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,838
Ring-a-ding-ding!

456
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,465
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

457
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,347
Hey, Sandy, would you like me
to pierce your ears for you?

458
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:44,434
Shut up!

459
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:48,271
- Quiet.
- Isn't that awfully dangerous?

460
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:51,733
Oh, no. I know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna be a beautician, you know.

461
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:54,403
- What's the matter? You afraid?
- No, I'm not.

462
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,279
Here, Frenchy,
you can use my virgin pin.

463
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,324
Yeah, it's nice to know
it's good for something.

464
00:26:58,407 --> 00:26:59,825
- It's perfect.
- Frenchy, I really don't think

465
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,035
it's a good idea.

466
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:03,328
- Oh, no, it's okay. Listen...
- My father won't like it. I promise you...

467
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,579
Ow!

468
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,790
Sandy, why don't we
go into the bathroom?

469
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,376
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood all over the carpet.

470
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:12,587
- What?
- It only bleeds for a second.

471
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,464
Frenchy, I don't feel very well.

472
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:16,342
Don't worry about it, Sandy.
If she screws up,

473
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:19,135
she can always fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

474
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,182
Sandy, Sandy,
beauty is pain.

475
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,561
Could you please get me some ice
to numb her ear lobes?

476
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,650
Why don't you just let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet?

477
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:33,776
Oh.

478
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,741
Personally, I'm getting rather chilly.

479
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,869
- Hey, what's that?
- From Bobby in Korea.

480
00:27:44,953 --> 00:27:48,123
- Are you going with a Korean?
- Dummy, he's a Marine.

481
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,583
- A Marine?
- A Marine?

482
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,544
Wanna see a picture?

483
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:56,548
God.
You're turning into a one-woman USO.

484
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:01,053
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

485
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,305
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and...

486
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,101
You ain't getting your hands on my ears.

487
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:08,894
Oh, yeah? Well, you'll be sorry

488
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,771
because I have been accepted
to La Cafury Beauty School.

489
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:13,773
You mean you're dropping out of Rydell?

490
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:15,733
Hey, I don't look at it as dropping out.

491
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:18,695
I look at it
as a very strategic career move.

492
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,116
- Why's it torn in half?
- His old girlfriend was in the picture.

493
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,374
Sandy, here's your toothbrush.

494
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,461
Oh, thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

495
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,338
It's okay.

496
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:41,634
Miss Goody Two-Shoes
makes me wanna barf.

497
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,222
Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee

498
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:50,018
Lousy with virginity

499
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,939
Won't go to bed till I'm legally wed

500
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:56,942
I can't, I'm Sandra Dee

501
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,318
Watch it

502
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:01,571
Hey, I'm Doris Day

503
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:05,491
I was not brought up that way

504
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,118
Won't come across

505
00:29:07,202 --> 00:29:09,288
Even Rock Hudson lost

506
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:14,500
his heart to Doris Day

507
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,421
I don't drink or swear

508
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,547
I don't rat my hair

509
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,424
I get ill from one cigarette

510
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:26,763
Keep your filthy paws
off my silky drawers

511
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:29,557
Would you pull that crap
with Annette?

512
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:36,022
As for you, Troy Donahue

513
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:39,734
I know what you wanna do

514
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:41,612
You got your crust

515
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:43,822
I'm no object of lust

516
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:46,991
I'm just plain Sandra Dee

517
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:52,413
Elvis! Elvis! Let me be

518
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,416
Keep that pelvis far from me

519
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,419
Just keep your cool

520
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:00,297
Now you're starting to drool

521
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,800
Hey, Fongool

522
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,053
I'm Sandra Dee

523
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,644
You're making fun of me, Rizz?

524
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,690
Some people are so touchy.

525
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,238
'Cause when the wind
was blowing my way

526
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,698
It smelled just like the halls
of old Rydell

527
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:29,201
And if you got to use a toilet

528
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,827
and later on they start
to scratch like hell

529
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,621
Will you shut up, you vultures?

530
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,373
Hey, I changed my mind.
Let's get out of here.

531
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,000
- Hey, what do you mean?
- What do you mean, what do I mean?

532
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:41,755
They can't come in here. My folks'll flip.

533
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,215
- Hey, Putzie, why don't you call her?
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

534
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,260
"Oh, Sandy.
Wherefore art thou, Sandy?"

535
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,262
- Shut up! Sit down.
- Come on, let's go.

536
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:53,016
You goody-goodies
are too much for me.

537
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:57,061
I'm gonna get my kicks
while I'm still young enough to get them.

538
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,897
What's she gonna do,
shimmy down the drainpipe?

539
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,942
Hey, look. There's Rizzo.

540
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,486
Hey, Rizzo, you're doing that
without a net.

541
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,371
Swell bunch you are,
rushing to help a lady.

542
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:17,207
- Lady? I don't see a lady.
- Shut up. Shut up!

543
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,544
- What's up, Kenick?
- One guess.

544
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:24,714
- You got a lot to offer a girl.
- Yeah, you know it.

545
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,092
What say you, Zuk?

546
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:30,261
You're looking good, Rizz.

547
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:34,182
- Eat your heart out.
- Well, sloppy seconds ain't my style.

548
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,356
Where are you going? To flog your log?

549
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:46,486
Well, it's better than
hanging around with you dorks.

550
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,154
- Hey, Danny!
- Hey, Danny!

551
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,699
Your chariot, my lady.

552
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:04,587
I don't know what I ever saw
in Danny Zuko.

553
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,298
Don't sweat it, honey. Have one of mine.

554
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,385
- There's so many of them.
- I know.

555
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,472
- How do you keep up with all of them?
- I'm a terrific pen pal.

556
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,017
Hopelessly devoted
to each and every one.

557
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:28,194
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Okay.

558
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:30,446
So what do you guys
think this is, a gangbang?

559
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,906
You wish.

560
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,911
- Hey, hit the pavement.
- You got to be kidding.

561
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:37,621
- I said now!
- All right, all right.

562
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:39,247
- Move it!
- Remember us in your will.

563
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,290
- Your will, all right.
- Come here.

564
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:49,215
When a guy picks a chick over
his buddies, something got to be wrong.

565
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:50,424
You said it.

566
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,220
Come on, guys,
let's go for a slice of pizza.

567
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,890
Can I have some of that?

568
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,517
Sure.

569
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,061
- Thanks.
- Wait.

570
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,421
Guess mine is not
the first heart broken

571
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:33,801
My eyes are not the first to cry

572
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,181
I'm not the first to know

573
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:43,269
There's just no getting over you

574
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:53,279
You know I'm just a fool who's willing

575
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:59,869
To sit around and wait for you

576
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,957
But, baby, can't you see

577
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:09,211
There's nothing else for me to do?

578
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:16,052
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

579
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:23,518
But now there's nowhere to hide

580
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:26,855
Since you pushed my love aside

581
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,442
I'm out of my head

582
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:52,338
Hopelessly devoted to you

583
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:02,014
My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"

584
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:08,188
My heart is saying, "Don't let go

585
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:12,983
"Hold on to the end"

586
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:17,447
And that's what I intend to do

587
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:24,746
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

588
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:31,920
But now there's nowhere to hide

589
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:35,257
Since you pushed my love aside

590
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:39,094
I'm out of my head

591
00:35:39,219 --> 00:36:00,407
Hopelessly devoted to you

592
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,335
Is acne
ruining your life?

593
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,755
Do you close your eyes
when you look in the mirror?

594
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,965
Fear no more.

595
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,135
Face up to Face-Off, for deep
penetration into infected pores.

596
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,306
Help dry up the unsightly pimples
and blemishes...

597
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:43,365
- Rizz. Rizz.
- Could you call me by my first name?

598
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,411
- Oh...
- Betty.

599
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:48,579
- Betty.
- Betty. Betty. Betty.

600
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,748
Oh, Betty. Betty.

601
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,626
Betty.

602
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,463
Have you got something?

603
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,465
Are you kidding?

604
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,143
- My 25 cent insurance policy.
- Big spender.

605
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,856
- What?
- It broke.

606
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:18,360
How could it break?

607
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,612
I bought it
when I was in the seventh grade.

608
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,172
What the hell?

609
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:49,807
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing?

610
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:52,768
You parked in a no-parking zone, creep.

611
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,938
The whole place
is a no-parking zone, crater-face.

612
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,148
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

613
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,947
You're gonna pay for that.

614
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:09,244
Yeah, well, I'll give you 75 cents for
the whole car, including your chick.

615
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:21,380
We just got to bang out
the dent, that's all there is to it.

616
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,715
The problem isn't in the dent,

617
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,217
the problem's
in this rubber-band engine.

618
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,760
The problem's in your mouth.

619
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,972
Yeah, and where you gonna get
a new carburettor, huh?

620
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:33,351
- You ever heard of borrowing?
- Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape?

621
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,271
Hey, big stuff. What do you drive, huh?

622
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:38,773
- I drive.
- Yeah? How about you?

623
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:40,442
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

624
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,277
Well, what about Doody?

625
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:44,945
- Well, hey, I...
- That's what I thought.

626
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,405
Now come on, guys.

627
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,076
Now, this car could be a major piece
of machinery, you know that?

628
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,286
Look at this.

629
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:55,039
Why, this car could be systematic.

630
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,083
Hydromatic.

631
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,128
Ultramatic.

632
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,797
Why, it could be Greased Lightning.

633
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:05,300
Greased Lightnin'!

634
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:09,012
We'll get some overhead lifters
and four barrel quads, oh, yeah

635
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,431
Keep talkin'
Wooh, keep talking

636
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:14,809
With fuel injection cut-off
and chrome plated rods, oh, yeah

637
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,311
We'll get it ready
I'll kill to get it ready

638
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,440
With a four-speed on the floor
they'll be waitin' at the door

639
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:21,900
You know that ain't no shit

640
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:24,360
We'll be getting lotsa tit
in Greased Lightnin'

641
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,780
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go

642
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:29,990
Go, Greased Lightnin'

Greased Lightnin'
Go, Greased Lightnin'

644
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:36,206
Go, Greased Lightnin', you're

645
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,375
Greased Lightnin'
Go, Greased Lightnin'

646
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:39,918
You are supreme

647
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:42,545
The chicks'll cream
for Greased Lightnin'

648
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,547
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go

649
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,760
We'll get some purple French taillights
and thirty inch fins, oh, yeah

650
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:54,431
A palomino dashboard
and dual muffler twins, oh, yeah

651
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,396
With new pistons, plugs and shocks
I can get off my rocks

652
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,021
You know that I ain't braggin'

653
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,565
She's a real pussy wagon
Greased Lightnin'

654
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,610
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go

655
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:09,072
Go, Greased Lightnin'

656
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,574
Greased Lightnin'
Go, Greased Lightnin'

657
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,161
Go, Greased Lightnin', you're

00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,581
You are supreme

660
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,501
The chicks'll cream

The chicks'll cream

00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:59,181
Lightnin', Lightnin', Lightnin', Lightnin'

669
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,726
Lightnin'

670
00:42:04,938 --> 00:42:07,231
- Come on, guys. Let's get to work.
- Yeah.

671
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,751
Hey, Zuk, man.
Those Scorpions, they're asking for it.

672
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:32,047
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

673
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:35,552
- What are you, nuts?
- Well, no. I was just thinking.

674
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:38,304
- Get in there. Don't think so much.
- No, that's cool, that's cool.

675
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:42,891
Hey, guys.

676
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:46,980
- Hey, Kenickie, Zuko.
- How's it hanging, huh?

677
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,983
Okay, the meeting is in session.

678
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,820
- You know what I heard?
- What?

679
00:42:53,945 --> 00:42:56,322
Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out,

680
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,282
and everybody got hauled to the clink.

681
00:42:59,492 --> 00:43:01,411
So? Nobody's gonna catch
Greased Lightning.

682
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:03,121
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

683
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,498
Somebody snaking you, Danny?

684
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,668
- Oh, bite the weenie, Rizz.
- With relish.

685
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,844
- I don't know about these chicks.
- Yeah, they're only good for one thing.

686
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:20,679
Then what are you
supposed to do with them

687
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,766
for the other 23 hours
and 45 minutes of the day?

688
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,101
Is that all it only takes, 15 minutes?

689
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,690
- Want some new music?
- Yeah.

690
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:33,985
I need some money.

691
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,697
Thanks.

692
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,371
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

693
00:43:51,836 --> 00:43:53,295
Hi, Danny!

694
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,717
- I can't talk to you right now.
- Listen, what are you doing later?

695
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,385
- I can't talk, all right?
- Call me.

696
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,315
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi.

697
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,485
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

698
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:16,568
That's good.

699
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:20,822
Hey, Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time now.

700
00:44:20,907 --> 00:44:23,742
- What about?
- Well, about that night at the bonfire.

701
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,329
I mean, the way I acted,
that was terrible.

702
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,081
I mean, it really was. I mean,
it wasn't me, you got to know that.

703
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,460
I mean, it was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

704
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:37,047
You see, Sandy, I got this image, right?
I got this...

705
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,342
Well, that's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

706
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:48,226
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

707
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:50,811
Jealous, are you?

708
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,400
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

709
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:56,608
Ha, ha, ha!

710
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,695
And what have you ever done?

711
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:05,326
Oh, come on!
I can run circles around those jerks.

712
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,619
I'll believe that when I see it.

713
00:45:31,686 --> 00:45:35,148
Let's start with the first rule.
Cut it down to two packs a day, huh?

714
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:36,440
There we go.

715
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,239
Now, what sort of athletics
are you interested in, huh?

716
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,949
You like the rings?

717
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:47,909
Yeah, I installed a set of rings
just a couple of weeks ago.

718
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:54,208
Well, the first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

719
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,543
Well, I know. That's why I'm here,
you know, to change.

720
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,172
- No, I mean your clothes.
- Oh.

721
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,097
All right, let's knock it off.

722
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:11,099
Fellows, I wanna introduce a new man.

723
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:14,186
Danny. Let's give him a tryout, huh?

724
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,731
You better watch it.

725
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:20,818
All right, come on, come on, come on.
A little fire, come on, here we go.

726
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:22,360
- Come on, come on.
- Hey, Danny.

727
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,000
You have to dribble.

728
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,005
- Here you go, Coach.
- Thank you, son.

729
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,217
Now, just dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

730
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,802
- Think you can do that?
- Can I do that!

731
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:48,762
- Okay.
- Let's go.

732
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,681
Danny, over here. Danny!

733
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,141
Let's go.

734
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,143
- Come on, Arnold.
- Come on, get it up.

735
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,938
Get it up there. Hey, that's it. Go, go, go.

736
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:58,648
Get him, Danny. Get him.

737
00:46:58,731 --> 00:47:02,235
There we are. Go, go.
Get him. That's it. That's it. That's it.

738
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,655
What'd I do?

739
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,407
- Is he kidding?
- Boy, oh, boy.

740
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:13,829
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner.

741
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,206
Danny, Andy.

742
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,418
- Are you crazy?
- Come on, come on, come on.

743
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:23,172
All right, come on, let's start.
Let's get into first position.

744
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,090
Danny, you get down.

745
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,094
Okay, Andy, get down. Ready?

746
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:29,679
Okay?

747
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:35,184
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

748
00:47:35,893 --> 00:47:38,771
Danny, you gotta try. You gotta try.
Try, come on.

749
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,313
Come on, let's get down.

750
00:47:40,398 --> 00:47:43,358
All right, Andy, let's change positions.
You get down. Come on.

751
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,532
All right. Ready?

752
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,913
- Give?
- Yeah, I give.

753
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,206
Good.

754
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:03,588
He's a hitter.

755
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:10,635
I think you're gonna like baseball.
It's not that much of a contact sport.

756
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,431
Now, get in there and let's see
what you can do, all right?

757
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:15,349
Throw the ball. Come on. Let's play.

758
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,851
Hey, where would you like it,
huh?

759
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:18,811
Come on, man.
Let's pitch this guy out here.

760
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,646
- He can't hit.
- This boy can't even bat.

761
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:24,692
- Strike.
- See? I told you. He doesn't even swing.

762
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,737
What kind of ball player are you?
Come on. Put it in here, Pitcher.

763
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,699
Strike.

764
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:34,784
Come on, a little pepper, a little fire.

765
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:37,704
Come on, a little fire in there.
Come on, come on. Let's see you hit it.

766
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,539
Put it in, put it in, put it in.

767
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,793
Foul ball.

768
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,173
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Now! Come on! Come on!

769
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,467
Put the bat down. Put the bat down!

770
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:55,722
Now, there's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact at all.

771
00:48:55,806 --> 00:48:58,351
- Oh, yeah, like what?
- Like track.

772
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:02,313
- What do you mean, running?
- What, you mean just like running?

773
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,440
I mean something
that needs endurance.

774
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:09,903
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

775
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,489
Cross-country running.

776
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:17,327
- That could be cool.
- Good.

777
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,083
Hey, cut it.
Come on, keep those legs high.

778
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,128
Take 10 laps.

779
00:49:44,313 --> 00:49:45,563
Danny.

780
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:51,862
Danny, are you all right?

781
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,532
Danny, talk to me.

782
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,371
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

783
00:50:00,454 --> 00:50:03,248
The way I treated...
Sandy, I told you I was sorry about that.

784
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,750
Got you talking.

785
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,213
- You sure you're okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

786
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:14,010
- So, still going out with that jockstrap?
- Well...

787
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:19,139
- Well, is he taking you to the dance?
- Well, that all depends.

788
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,766
- On what?
- On you.

789
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,434
- On me?
- Yeah.

790
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:25,186
He can stag it.

791
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,485
Come on.

792
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,041
Sandy, come on,
let's go someplace else tonight.

793
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,460
Why?

794
00:50:49,086 --> 00:50:51,297
Because we can't be alone here,
that's why.

795
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,590
Danny.

796
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,967
Okay.

797
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,264
Two burgers and a moo-juice,
coming up.

798
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:06,228
You nearly pulled my arm
out of the socket.

799
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,565
Well, I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best table they got.

800
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,608
What are you doing?

801
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,693
I just want a little privacy for us,
all right?

802
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,155
- What'll it be, kids?
- Oh, a cherry soda, please.

803
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:19,240
- Danny?
- Oh, I'm not very hungry.

804
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,827
Just give me a double polar burger
with everything

805
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:23,746
and a cherry soda
with chocolate ice cream.

806
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:25,914
That sounds good. I'll have the same.

807
00:51:25,998 --> 00:51:28,208
The same? You can eat a lot, can't you?

808
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,835
- You know, you're funny.
- No, you are.

809
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:34,005
How you doing, Zuk, huh? Nice?
Golden glooms.

810
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,175
- Hi, Rizzo. How are you?
- Peachy keen, jelly bean.

811
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:41,097
Hey, you got a couple of quarters?
We can split an Eskimo Pie.

812
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,434
- My Dutch treat days are over.
- You plan on staying home a lot.

813
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:47,811
Hey, greetings, pals and gals.

814
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,773
Hey, I got 23 cents. Anybody wanna
chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

815
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,110
I don't know where all my money goes.

816
00:51:54,193 --> 00:51:56,152
A dime here, 15 cents there.

817
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:57,570
Yeah, well, in another couple of months,

818
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,614
Frenchy here will be able
to take us all out. Huh?

819
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,407
- A working girl with income.
- Hey, that's right.

820
00:52:01,534 --> 00:52:04,286
Well, you know, they don't pay
you very much to start off with.

821
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,079
Yeah, well, that's still more
than we make.

822
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,791
So ante up because
I don't get my allowance until Friday.

823
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,168
- What? You get an allowance?
- When I'm a good boy I do.

824
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,003
Hey, Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight
with four spoons.

825
00:52:14,088 --> 00:52:17,048
- And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
- Hi, gang.

826
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,387
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

827
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:28,101
I got so many hickeys
people will think I'm a leper.

828
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,063
Hey, cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

829
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,692
"When you care enough
to send the very best."

830
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:37,402
You pig.

831
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,822
I love it when you talk dirty.

832
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:44,242
My parents want to invite you over to
tea on Sunday. Do you wanna come?

833
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:48,914
- I don't like tea.
- You don't have to drink tea.

834
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:51,791
Well, I don't like parents.

835
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,336
Want some?

836
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,590
You sure are a cheap date.

837
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,550
Oh, I didn't mean it the way it came out.

838
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,844
I understand.

839
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:04,096
I always thought you were
a very understanding person.

840
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,389
I am.

841
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:09,143
And I also think
that there's more to you than just fat.

842
00:53:09,476 --> 00:53:10,768
Thanks.

843
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:12,353
You're welcome.

844
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:14,356
- You got a date for the dance-off?
- No.

845
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,065
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

846
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,068
Oh, no, I'm gonna be a senior forever

847
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:20,445
if I don't study
for that dumb algebra test tomorrow.

848
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,114
Hey, you're in luck, luscious.
You got an armed escort home.

849
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,159
It's not the arms
I'm worried about, Sonny.

850
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,786
It's the hands.

851
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,371
She loves me.

852
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,376
- Hey, you coming, French?
- Oh, I don't think so.

853
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,503
I think I'd like to hang out
a little bit longer.

854
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,713
All right.

855
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,132
I have been dieting all day long.

856
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,635
My mom's apple pie
is better than this stuff.

857
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,012
- Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.

858
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,389
- Hey, Putzie.
- Yeah?

859
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,141
Fifteen minutes.

860
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:52,603
You know, Danny,
I'm kind of worried about this dance-off.

861
00:53:52,686 --> 00:53:54,980
Maybe they dance differently
than we do back home.

862
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,233
Don't worry about it.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

863
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,320
Come on, let's get out of here, Sandy.

864
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,239
Zuko, see you later, okay.

865
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,326
- Bye, Frenchy.
- See you, Sandy.

866
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,998
Great. I get stuck
with the cheque again. Give me money.

867
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,585
Okay, what is it, huh?
What's with you tonight?

868
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,253
You've got the personality of a wet mop.

869
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,505
Don't start with me.

870
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:22,925
Oh, sure, fine. Okay, eureka.
How about I finish with you, huh?

871
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,510
Finish this!

872
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,054
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

873
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:31,891
Sorry, French.

874
00:54:32,726 --> 00:54:34,353
Rizzo!

875
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,358
Hey, Rizzo!
I wanna talk to you! Now!

876
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,737
No use crying over spilled milkshake.

877
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,782
Oh, I'll be okay.

878
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,286
You know it's near closing time,
don't you?

879
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:52,788
Do you mind if I stay around
a little longer, Vi?

880
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:54,623
No, suit yourself.

881
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,208
- Wow.
- What?

882
00:54:57,418 --> 00:55:01,588
Well, I hate to tell you this
but your hair looks like an Easter egg.

883
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,548
Oh, yeah.

884
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,760
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.

885
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:10,681
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

886
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:13,599
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it was gonna be.

887
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:15,853
Oh, nothing ever is.

888
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:20,440
Vi?

889
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,402
I dropped out.

890
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,987
What do you think of waitressing?

891
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,197
You're too young to know.

892
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:31,869
Hey, maybe I could be
a telephone operator.

893
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,998
Nah, I don't think I would like to wear
those little things over my ears.

894
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:42,086
God, if only I could have
a guardian angel to tell me what to do.

895
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:45,298
You know, like Debbie Reynolds
had in Tammy

896
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,092
What do you think?

897
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,262
If you find him,
give him my phone number.

898
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,780
Your story's sad to tell

899
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:13,452
A teenage ne'er-do-well

900
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:19,583
Most mixed-up non-delinquent
on the block

901
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,005
Your future's so unclear now

902
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,344
What's left of your career now?

903
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,139
Can't even get a trade in

904
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,434
on your smock

905
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,369
Beauty School Dropout

906
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:00,623
No Graduation Day for you

907
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,835
Beauty School Dropout

908
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:07,338
Missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo

909
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,634
Well, at least you could have taken time

910
00:57:10,717 --> 00:57:13,679
to wash and clean your clothes up

911
00:57:13,804 --> 00:57:16,264
After spending all that dough

912
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:19,726
to have the doctor fix your nose up

913
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,853
Baby, get movin'

914
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,190
Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

915
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,360
What are you provin'?

916
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,864
You've got the dream but not the drive

917
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,992
If you go for your diploma

918
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,911
you could join a steno pool

919
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,081
Turn in your teasing comb

920
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:44,208
and go back to high school

921
00:57:48,422 --> 00:57:50,923
Beauty School Dropout

922
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:54,552
Hangin' around the corner store

923
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,097
Beauty School Dropout

924
00:57:58,056 --> 00:58:01,559
It's about time you knew the score

925
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,771
Well, they couldn't teach you anything

926
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,773
You think you're such a looker

927
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,360
But no customer would go to you

928
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:14,530
unless she was a hooker

929
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:20,536
Baby, don't sweat it

930
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:22,079
Don't sweat it

931
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:25,333
You're not cut out to hold a job

932
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,376
Better forget it

933
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:28,753
Forget it

934
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,048
Who wants their hair done by a slob?

935
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:35,719
Now your bangs are curled
your lashes twirled

936
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:38,347
But still the world is cruel

937
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,641
Wipe off that angel face

938
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:43,559
and go back to high school

939
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,605
Baby, don't blow it

940
00:58:48,106 --> 00:58:51,275
Don't put my good advice to shame

941
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,277
Baby, you know it

942
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,824
Even Dear Abby'd say the same

943
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,784
Now, I've called the shot

944
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,411
Get off the pot

945
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:06,123
I really gotta fly

946
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,835
Gotta be goin'

947
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,590
to that malt shop

948
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:18,804
in the sky

949
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:26,894
- Beauty School Dropout
- Beauty School Dropout

950
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,606
Go back to high school

951
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,277
- Beauty School Dropout
- Beauty School Dropout

952
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,028
Go back to high school

953
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:39,699
- Beauty School Dropout
- Beauty School Dropout

954
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,869
Go back to high school

955
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,510
- Just lower your head, Kenickie.
- What are you doing?

956
00:59:58,635 --> 01:00:00,429
Come on, Kenickie.
Give him a break, huh?

957
01:00:00,512 --> 01:00:04,141
- Oh, I'll give you a break all right.
- No, we'll work on the brakes later.

958
01:00:04,224 --> 01:00:05,726
Move over, slick.

959
01:00:05,851 --> 01:00:07,978
- Hey, fruitcake, you got it on backwards.
- All right.

960
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:09,980
What kind of car
did you swipe this from anyway?

961
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:11,063
- Your mother's.
- Your mother's.

962
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,942
Hey, Charlie, don't forget
the other cable, huh?

963
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,737
There's a ramp set up
at the service door for that camera.

964
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,740
Rizz.

965
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:30,000
Can you believe it?
We'll be on nationwide television.

966
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,922
- How you doing?
- You still gonna go to the dance?

967
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,719
Man, I'm gonna have
the hottest date there.

968
01:00:41,762 --> 01:00:45,181
Biggest thing that ever happened
to Rydell High and we don't have dates.

969
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,266
What about Rudie
from the Capri Lounge?

970
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,561
- Get serious.
- It's a suggestion.

971
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:51,228
Well, I already called him.

972
01:00:57,778 --> 01:01:00,405
Relax, I think our luck is changing.

973
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:09,414
Do you know what you're doing?

974
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:11,625
What we're doing. Come on.

975
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,907
Hey, Marty, you're looking good.

976
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,284
Would you just excuse me one second?

977
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,498
You're feeling good, too, huh?

978
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,376
Sonny, there he is.
Look, that's Vince Fontaine.

979
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,503
Yeah, I've seen better heads
on a mug of beer.

980
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,340
Would you grow up? He's the living end.

981
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:02,759
Yeah, if you like older guys.

982
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,273
Danny, this is so exciting.

983
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,485
Yeah, well, you see what you gotta do
is make friends with the cameraman.

984
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,155
- You know the cameraman?
- Yeah, his name's Ted.

985
01:02:23,822 --> 01:02:25,865
Doody, how do I look?

986
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,659
Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

987
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,579
That's good. That's good.

988
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,541
You're late, fellows.
Where you been, huh?

989
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:37,585
- Boy, the gym never looked so good.
- Yeah, did you bring the provisions?

990
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,713
All right, kids.
I want a big circle here, a big circle.

991
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:46,927
Come on, boys and girls,
we are going on the air very shortly.

992
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:49,722
But first,
let's have some warm-up numbers

993
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,684
with Johnny Casino and The Gamblers.

994
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,001
- What are their names?
- Fred and Ginger.

995
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:02,670
- Fred and Ginger.
- But... Go tell him the truth.

996
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,320
I hope I don't get camera fright.

997
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:30,072
Oh, don't worry about it.
We're gonna be cool, all right?

998
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,032
- Yeah?
- Don't worry?

999
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:33,994
Good. Come on, let's go.

1000
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,139
Why don't you let me lead
for a change?

1001
01:04:54,222 --> 01:04:56,307
I can't help it. I'm used to leading.

1002
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:57,559
Okay.

1003
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,731
Doody, can't you turn me around
or something?

1004
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:06,150
Don't talk, French. I'm trying to count.

1005
01:05:07,527 --> 01:05:11,114
A melody that's
never the same

1006
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:13,867
A melody that's calling your name

1007
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:16,494
Did you ever think about
taking up singing professionally?

1008
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,331
Come back to me,
please

1009
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:24,668
Hey, Zuko! Zuk! Zuk!
I want you to meet Cha Cha DiGregorio.

1010
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:27,297
- How you doing, Zuko baby?
- All right.

1011
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,965
- Who is she?
- They call me Cha Cha,

1012
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:32,635
'cause I'm the best dancer
at Saint Bernadette's.

1013
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:34,929
With the worst reputation.

1014
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,389
Let's go, Sandy.

1015
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:42,186
- Who's that girl?
- She's just a girl I know, that's all.

1016
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,402
Hi.

1017
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,072
I'm Vince Fontaine.

1018
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:56,992
Hey, do your folks know
I come into your room every night?

1019
01:05:57,077 --> 01:05:59,161
Over KZAZ, that is.

1020
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:04,501
I'm judging the dance contest.

1021
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,543
I don't think I'm entered.

1022
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:08,463
A knockout like you?

1023
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,673
- What's your name?
- Marty.

1024
01:06:10,757 --> 01:06:14,010
- Marty what?
- Maraschino.

1025
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:16,387
You know, like in cherry.

1026
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:41,036
- What are you doing?
- Washing my hands.

1027
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,436
How do you know her?

1028
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:07,771
She's just an old friend of the family,
that's all.

1029
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:17,574
- Aren't you glad to be back?
- Oh, yeah.

1030
01:07:17,657 --> 01:07:20,201
Besides, blondes do have more fun.

1031
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,463
When I hear music,
I just can't make my feet behave.

1032
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,090
- Thinks she's Tinker Bell.
- Hush, Sonny.

1033
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,230
The Rydell fight song!

1034
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:16,423
- When you are finished.
- We're finished.

1035
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,845
You will be happy to know that
I am not judging the dance contest.

1036
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,186
I think we all owe a round of applause

1037
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:32,606
to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felsnick

1038
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,318
and committee
for their beautiful decorations.

1039
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:37,569
Let's hear it for the toilet paper!

1040
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:46,412
In a few moments, the entire nation
will be watching Rydell High.

1041
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:47,872
God help us!

1042
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,833
And I want you all
to be on your best behaviour.

1043
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:52,627
No heinie biting!

1044
01:08:54,712 --> 01:08:58,466
And now, here he is,
the Prince of the Platters,

1045
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,635
Mr. Vince Fontaine.

1046
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,103
Mr. Vince Fontaine!

1047
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:37,421
Hey, it's great being here
at Rydell High.

1048
01:09:39,757 --> 01:09:41,676
What's your name, sweetheart?

1049
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,305
Hiya, honey.

1050
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:47,431
And now for the rules.

1051
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,186
Game rule one.

1052
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,479
All couples must be boy-girl.

1053
01:09:54,564 --> 01:09:56,356
Yeah, too bad, Eugene.

1054
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:01,279
All right, all right, all right. Come on.

1055
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:03,323
Game rule two.

1056
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:05,783
During the dance contest,
if you're tapped on the shoulder,

1057
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,744
you must leave
the floor immediately or else.

1058
01:10:08,828 --> 01:10:10,037
I mean it.

1059
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,706
And rule three,

1060
01:10:11,789 --> 01:10:16,752
anyone doing tasteless or vulgar
movements will be disqualified.

1061
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,546
That leaves us out.

1062
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,636
Can we keep it clean, please?
Let's keep it clean.

1063
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,137
- Twenty seconds.
- Oh, 20 seconds.

1064
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:28,890
Thank you, fans and friends
and odds and ends.

1065
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,141
And now for you gals and guys,
a few words to the wise.

1066
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:32,644
You Jims and Sals are my best pals,

1067
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,103
and to look your best for the big contest,

1068
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,520
just be yourselves and have a ball.

1069
01:10:35,605 --> 01:10:36,939
That's what it's all about after all!

1070
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,690
So forget about the camera
and think about the beat,

1071
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:40,150
we'll give the folks at home
a real big treat.

1072
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,402
Don't worry about where the camera is,

1073
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,819
just keep on dancing, that's your biz.

1074
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:44,447
Hey, and if I tap your shoulder,
move to the side,

1075
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:45,948
let the others finish the ride.

1076
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,367
Ten seconds.

1077
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,993
Nine, eight,

1078
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,412
seven, six, five, four,

1079
01:10:52,497 --> 01:10:54,623
three, two, one.

1080
01:10:54,707 --> 01:10:56,167
On the air.

1081
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,211
Hello, welcome to National Bandstand,

1082
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:00,296
coming to you live
from Rydell High School.

1083
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,173
This is the event you've all been
waiting for, the National Dance-Off.

1084
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,677
And away we go with
Johnny Casino and The Gamblers.

1085
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:24,069
Look, there's the camera!

1086
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:35,247
- Look, it's Putzie and Jan.
- Yeah.

1087
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:02,734
Oh, there's Danny and Sandy.

1088
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,005
Now to the event you've all been
waiting for, the National Dance-Off.

1089
01:12:25,423 --> 01:12:27,591
Some lucky guy and gal
is gonna go bopping home

1090
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,010
with some fantabulous prizes.

1091
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,511
But don't feel bad if I bump youse out

1092
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:32,180
'cause it doesn't matter
if you win or lose,

1093
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,765
it's what you do
with your dancing shoes.

1094
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,100
Hey, does everybody here know Marty?

1095
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:43,065
Okay, cats, throw your mittens
around your kittens and away we go!

1096
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:49,697
That wasn't supposed to happen!

1097
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,367
Let's go! Let's hand jive!

1098
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,453
Before I was born late one night

1099
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,375
My papa said everything's all right

1100
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,211
The doctor made my ma lay down

1101
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:04,712
That guy over there
with the chick in the red,

1102
01:13:04,796 --> 01:13:05,880
throw them out.

1103
01:13:05,963 --> 01:13:08,131
With her stomach bouncing all around

1104
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:10,717
'Cause a bebop stork
Was about to arrive

1105
01:13:10,802 --> 01:13:12,804
My mom gave birth to the hand jive

1106
01:13:14,472 --> 01:13:17,391
I could barely walk
When I milked a cow

1107
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:20,645
When I was three, I pushed a plough

1108
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:24,774
While chopping wood, I'd move my legs

1109
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,778
And started dancing
While I gathered eggs

1110
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,488
The townfolk clapped
When I was only five

1111
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,324
I'd outdance them all
He's born to hand jive

1112
01:13:35,284 --> 01:13:37,453
Yes, move it, buddy.

1113
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:40,914
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1114
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:43,000
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

1115
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,002
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1116
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:47,337
Attagirl!

1117
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:51,091
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

1118
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,260
Everybody!

1119
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:59,141
Born to hand jive, baby

1120
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:01,018
Yeah.

1121
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,438
Here we go. Come on.

1122
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:06,023
Hey, break it up, break it up!
What is that?

1123
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,192
Break it up!

1124
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:13,155
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1125
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:16,117
Come on now, shake it!

1126
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:17,659
Yeah!

1127
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,121
Twist it!

1128
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,841
All right, get it!

1129
01:15:03,414 --> 01:15:09,921
How low can you go?

1130
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:12,215
No, no, don't. Bad boy! Not here!

1131
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,408
There you go!

1132
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:44,287
Come on now, hand jive!

1133
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:08,813
That's the stuff!

1134
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:13,775
Do it, baby!

1135
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,279
Do it!

1136
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:30,667
That's the hand jive grand jive!

1137
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:52,898
Yeah, now let's bring it up!

1138
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:54,817
Bring it on up!

1139
01:16:57,362 --> 01:17:00,238
Higher!

1140
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:04,243
Higher and higher!

1141
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,872
Now can you hand jive, baby?

1142
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:11,375
Oh, can you hand jive, baby?

1143
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:16,756
Oh, yeah

1144
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,841
Born to hand jive!
Oh, yeah!

1145
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,676
Oh, yeah!

1146
01:17:21,761 --> 01:17:24,095
Now let's meet them.
Here they are, the new champs.

1147
01:17:24,221 --> 01:17:26,390
Come on. Come on over here.

1148
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:32,604
- Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha DiGregorio and Danny Zuko.

1149
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:34,481
Cha Cha and Danny,
congratulations.

1150
01:17:34,565 --> 01:17:35,940
Come on, we're gonna do it now.

1151
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,152
- Where's Marty?
- Don't worry, she's in good hands.

1152
01:17:38,235 --> 01:17:40,279
- Whose?
- I don't know.

1153
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,408
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

1154
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,246
Blue moon

1155
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,211
You saw me standing alone

1156
01:17:57,963 --> 01:18:02,301
Without a dream in my heart

1157
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:08,474
Without a love of my own

1158
01:18:09,975 --> 01:18:12,728
Ready?
One, one, two, three, go.

1159
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,814
Blue moon

1160
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,444
I wonder who that is on the right?

1161
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:25,490
We have pictures
of you so-called mooners.

1162
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,202
And just because the pictures
aren't of your faces

1163
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,246
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1164
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:34,332
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington

1165
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:39,630
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.

1166
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:44,719
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.

1167
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:09,952
Come on, Doody,
watch your hands. Putzie, move it out.

1168
01:19:10,036 --> 01:19:12,454
I feel like a meatball in here.

1169
01:19:12,538 --> 01:19:15,207
- Okay, let's go find the chicks.
- Yeah.

1170
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,251
Marty. Marty.

1171
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,841
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

1172
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:27,011
- All right.
- I'm not hungry.

1173
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,180
- I'm not hungry.
- Hey, what's happening?

1174
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,015
There's nobody here.

1175
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:39,564
Oh, come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone that I was sorry.

1176
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,818
- I know that you did.
- Well, you do believe me, don't you?

1177
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:46,279
Well, yes, but I still think
that you and Cha Cha went together.

1178
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:50,201
We did not go together, Sandy.
We just went together, that's all.

1179
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:53,871
- It's the same thing.
- No. No. No.

1180
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,938
Oh! Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry. I...

1181
01:20:28,405 --> 01:20:29,573
Sandy,

1182
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:33,452
would you wear my ring?

1183
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:36,663
Oh, Danny. I don't know what to say.

1184
01:20:36,747 --> 01:20:38,748
- Say "yes."
- Yes.

1185
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:46,006
Oh, Danny, this means so much to me,

1186
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,466
'cause I know now that you respect me.

1187
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,768
Hey, Rizz?

1188
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,185
Watch it.

1189
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:03,690
- What is with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.

1190
01:21:03,774 --> 01:21:05,818
- Huh?
- I skipped a period.

1191
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,362
- You think you're PG?
- I don't know. Big deal.

1192
01:21:08,445 --> 01:21:11,323
- Well, was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.

1193
01:21:11,448 --> 01:21:13,993
Well, hey, Rizz, look...
Look, Rizz, it's okay.

1194
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:17,579
I caught Vince Fontaine trying to put
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

1195
01:21:17,663 --> 01:21:20,957
Hey. Marty, you ain't gonna tell
nobody about this, right?

1196
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:23,793
Oh, sure, Rizz.
Look, I'll take it to the grave, okay?

1197
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:31,010
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

1198
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:36,556
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1199
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,018
Rizzo's pregnant. Don't tell anybody.

1200
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:46,108
Hey, Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1201
01:21:57,578 --> 01:21:59,412
Rizzo's knocked up.

1202
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,711
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1203
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:06,962
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.

1204
01:22:07,046 --> 01:22:09,131
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1205
01:22:09,882 --> 01:22:11,966
Why didn't you tell me about it?

1206
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,927
What's it to you?

1207
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:16,262
I thought I might be able
to do something.

1208
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:17,972
You did enough.

1209
01:22:19,391 --> 01:22:21,935
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1210
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:26,189
Hey, don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

1211
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,948
Thanks a lot, kid.

1212
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,574
Anytime.

1213
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,835
- Oh, I hope you're not getting a cold.
- Oh, no. No.

1214
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,921
It's just probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

1215
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:04,395
- Danny!
- Sandy! Oh, Sandy.

1216
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,896
- Danny, what are you doing?
- Oh, Sandy.

1217
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:08,690
Don't worry about it, nobody's watching.

1218
01:23:08,774 --> 01:23:10,484
Danny, get off me!

1219
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,904
Sandy, what's the matter with you?
I thought I meant something to you.

1220
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:16,407
Meant something to you?

1221
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:19,451
You think I'm gonna stay here
with you in this sin wagon?

1222
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,828
You can take this piece of tin!

1223
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:25,498
Sandy, you just can't
walk out of a drive-in!

1224
01:23:35,092 --> 01:23:37,594
Stranded at the drive-in

1225
01:23:38,887 --> 01:23:42,224
Branded a fool

1226
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,894
What will they say

1227
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:49,856
Monday at school?

1228
01:23:57,364 --> 01:24:01,618
Sandy, can't you see

1229
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,579
I'm in misery?

1230
01:24:05,873 --> 01:24:07,832
We made a start

1231
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:10,168
Now we're apart

1232
01:24:10,252 --> 01:24:13,505
There's nothin' left for me

1233
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,966
Love has flown

1234
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:22,221
All alone I sit and wonder why-yi-yi-yi

1235
01:24:23,682 --> 01:24:27,060
Why you left me

1236
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:33,274
Oh, Sandy

1237
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,362
Baby, someday

1238
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:40,783
when high school is done

1239
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:46,204
Somehow, some way

1240
01:24:46,288 --> 01:24:49,500
our two worlds will be one

1241
01:24:50,793 --> 01:24:54,962
In heaven forever

1242
01:24:55,047 --> 01:24:58,509
and ever we will be

1243
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:02,720
Oh, please, say you'll stay

1244
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,057
Oh, Sandy

1245
01:25:09,561 --> 01:25:11,814
Sandy, my darling

1246
01:25:12,481 --> 01:25:14,565
you hurt me real bad

1247
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,152
You know it's true

1248
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,364
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say

1249
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:25,077
I'm helpless without you

1250
01:25:26,078 --> 01:25:28,247
Love has flown

1251
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:33,460
All alone I sit, I wonder why-yi-yi-yi

1252
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:38,215
Oh, why you left me

1253
01:25:38,966 --> 01:25:41,467
Oh, Sandy

1254
01:25:43,846 --> 01:25:50,394
Sandy

1255
01:25:54,606 --> 01:25:58,734
Why-yi-yi-yi?

1256
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:01,779
Oh, Sandy!

1257
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,287
Head it out. Come on, guys.

1258
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:10,788
All right, pull out! Pull out! Pull out!

1259
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,255
Well, the crate shaped up.

1260
01:26:18,338 --> 01:26:20,298
And it's as hot as the parts on it.

1261
01:26:20,382 --> 01:26:22,551
Hey, we didn't steal all of it.
Some of it was donated.

1262
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:25,304
Yeah, this baby's gonna knock them
on their ears at Thunder Road.

1263
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:27,764
You're right.
You could still change your mind.

1264
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,185
- The flag goes down in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.

1265
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,769
Hey, Mrs. Murdock, you coming?

1266
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:36,064
I don't expect my boys to let me down,
and I won't let them down.

1267
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,442
- That's the way!
- Way to go, Murdock!

1268
01:26:39,109 --> 01:26:41,153
I wanna talk to you.

1269
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:46,324
Hey, look, those guys at Thunder Road,
they don't fool around.

1270
01:26:46,408 --> 01:26:48,034
You know that, right?

1271
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,703
You want me to punk out?

1272
01:26:50,787 --> 01:26:53,707
No, I'm not saying punking out,
but I'm just...

1273
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,792
You know what I mean. I...

1274
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:02,591
Hey, Danny, we've been friends
a long time, right?

1275
01:27:03,217 --> 01:27:04,384
Yeah.

1276
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,471
Well, you remember the drive-in
the other night, we went

1277
01:27:08,555 --> 01:27:11,934
and the movie, and it was like the duel
and the guy's best friend went with him

1278
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,061
and was like his lieutenant,
like his second, you know?

1279
01:27:15,145 --> 01:27:16,771
Yeah. So?

1280
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:23,444
Well, I thought that you could maybe
be my second at Thunder Road.

1281
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,405
What do you mean? You want me
to drive with you or what?

1282
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:27,573
No, I...

1283
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,119
Oh. Hey, hey.

1284
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,378
Well, listen, I'll pick you up
at 3:00, huh?

1285
01:27:40,462 --> 01:27:42,130
- Yeah, see you later.
- Yeah.

1286
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:45,384
Hey, open up the door.
What are you guys standing around for?

1287
01:27:45,467 --> 01:27:48,511
Get that can off the front of the car,
you putz.

1288
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,770
Oh, hello, Rizz.

1289
01:27:56,854 --> 01:27:59,564
- Are you going to Thunder Road?
- Not a chance.

1290
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,817
I've got to go. I have to talk to Danny.

1291
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:05,069
Unless you got wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

1292
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:07,823
Listen, Rizz, I know that we
haven't been the best of friends,

1293
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:09,533
but if there's anything I can do...

1294
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:13,369
Oh, I can take care of myself
and anybody else who comes along.

1295
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:17,164
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

1296
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,792
Hey.

1297
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,171
Thanks.

1298
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,059
That's the one I was telling you about.

1299
01:28:39,229 --> 01:28:42,899
There are worse things
I could do

1300
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:47,194
than go with a boy or two

1301
01:28:48,405 --> 01:28:50,489
Even though the neighbourhood

1302
01:28:50,574 --> 01:28:54,243
thinks I'm trashy and no good

1303
01:28:54,369 --> 01:28:58,164
I suppose it could be true

1304
01:28:58,248 --> 01:29:02,336
But there are worse things I could do

1305
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:07,548
I could flirt with all the guys

1306
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:15,349
Smile at them and bat my eyes

1307
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:20,936
Press against them when we dance

1308
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:24,524
Make them think they stand a chance

1309
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:28,528
Then refuse to see it through

1310
01:29:29,363 --> 01:29:31,739
That's a thing I'd never do

1311
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:37,453
I could stay home every night

1312
01:29:39,122 --> 01:29:43,793
Wait around for Mr. Right

1313
01:29:46,213 --> 01:29:49,632
Take cold showers every day

1314
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:53,136
And throw my life away

1315
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,305
on a dream that won't come true

1316
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:03,563
I could hurt someone like me

1317
01:30:06,274 --> 01:30:11,154
Out of spite or jealousy

1318
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:16,493
I don't steal and I don't lie

1319
01:30:16,618 --> 01:30:19,996
But I can feel and I can cry

1320
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:25,167
A fact I'll bet you never knew

1321
01:30:27,796 --> 01:30:32,341
But to cry in front of you

1322
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:37,346
That's the worst thing

1323
01:30:37,472 --> 01:30:42,101
I could do

1324
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,899
So, you guys think
you got a winner there, huh?

1325
01:31:29,024 --> 01:31:30,233
That's right.

1326
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,319
Yeah, well, it takes more than a coat
of paint to make it at Thunder Road.

1327
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:34,904
- Oh, yeah?
- You guys ain't thinking

1328
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,573
about changing your mind, are you?

1329
01:31:36,698 --> 01:31:39,658
- No way.
- Good, 'cause we're racing for pinks.

1330
01:31:39,743 --> 01:31:40,993
Pinks?

1331
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:44,247
Pinks, you punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

1332
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,917
Come on, Zuk.

1333
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,337
Come on. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it, all right?

1334
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:53,422
Hey, get the dude, man.

1335
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:04,434
- What did she give him?
- A lock of hair from her chest.

1336
01:32:07,646 --> 01:32:09,271
Poor Kenickie.

1337
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:15,654
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

1338
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:17,279
Give me that.

1339
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:23,036
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

1340
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:24,287
Yeah, well, she's gonna.

1341
01:32:24,412 --> 01:32:27,164
Here, Kenickie. I brought you
a little something for good luck.

1342
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,958
- Gee, thanks.
- Oops, I'm sorry.

1343
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:31,502
Hey, don't worry about it.
Don't worry, I'll get it.

1344
01:32:36,466 --> 01:32:37,841
You putz!

1345
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:41,805
Oh, here, put this under his head.

1346
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:46,059
- Zuko, he's out cold.
- What are we gonna do?

1347
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:48,686
Kenickie. Hey, talk to me, buddy, huh?

1348
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:50,771
- What?
- You okay?

1349
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:54,359
Yeah. I'm okay.

1350
01:32:54,484 --> 01:32:55,609
I'm fine.

1351
01:32:55,694 --> 01:32:57,612
- Oh, God.
- Oh, you can't drive.

1352
01:32:57,697 --> 01:33:02,324
Hey, no, really, I'm all right.
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

1353
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:06,453
Hey, you want me to drive for you, huh?

1354
01:33:07,539 --> 01:33:10,542
Yeah.

1355
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:12,961
All right. Come on, let's help him up.

1356
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:15,212
Hey, Marty, give me a hand.

1357
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:31,729
Hey.

1358
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:34,356
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

1359
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:35,899
It's to the second bridge and back

1360
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,528
and the one
who makes it here first, wins.

1361
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:41,030
Haul ass, kid.

1362
01:34:00,717 --> 01:34:03,345
You ain't gonna see me for dust, Zuko.

1363
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,914
Zuk! Go! Go! Go!

1364
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:37,212
Come on, baby.

1365
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:17,103
- All right!
- Congratulations!

1366
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:27,447
For he's
a jolly good fellow

1367
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:31,451
For he's a jolly good fellow

1368
01:36:31,534 --> 01:36:34,037
Which nobody can deny

1369
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:38,248
Look at me

1370
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,377
There has to be

1371
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:46,548
something more
than what they see

1372
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:49,886
Wholesome and pure

1373
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:53,640
Oh, so scared and unsure

1374
01:36:53,724 --> 01:36:58,269
A poor man's Sandra Dee

1375
01:36:58,645 --> 01:37:00,438
Danny won.

1376
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:02,398
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

1377
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:07,569
What's the matter? Aren't you happy?

1378
01:37:07,654 --> 01:37:10,448
No, not really, Frenchy,
but I think I know a way I could be.

1379
01:37:10,573 --> 01:37:12,951
- Could you help me?
- Of course.

1380
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,787
- Can I come over to your place?
- Sure. Come on.

1381
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:25,838
Sandy, you must start anew

1382
01:37:26,256 --> 01:37:30,385
Don't you know what you must do?

1383
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:33,179
Hold your head high

1384
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:36,224
Take a deep breath and sigh

1385
01:37:36,307 --> 01:37:38,016
Come on, Sandy.

1386
01:37:38,101 --> 01:37:39,810
Goodbye

1387
01:37:39,936 --> 01:37:44,940
to Sandra Dee

1388
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:03,626
Attention, seniors.

1389
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:06,753
Before the merriment
of commencement commences,

1390
01:38:06,838 --> 01:38:10,216
I hope that your years with us
here at Rydell High

1391
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:13,011
have prepared you
for the challenges you face.

1392
01:38:13,136 --> 01:38:17,806
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

1393
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:20,310
or a Rosemary Clooney.

1394
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:23,020
And among you young men,
there may be

1395
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:26,649
a Joe DiMaggio,
a President Eisenhower

1396
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:29,234
or even a Vice President Nixon.

1397
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:34,740
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

1398
01:38:34,824 --> 01:38:36,658
Rydell forever.

1399
01:38:36,743 --> 01:38:38,493
Bon voyage.

1400
01:38:44,167 --> 01:38:46,836
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

1401
01:39:27,752 --> 01:39:29,045
How many?

1402
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:30,963
One.

1403
01:39:35,051 --> 01:39:37,761
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

1404
01:39:37,845 --> 01:39:41,056
- How can we flunk Phys Ed?
- Did I take Phys Ed?

1405
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,394
Step right up here!

1406
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:48,355
It's for a wonderful cause,
the Teachers' Retirement Fund.

1407
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:50,817
Give them a pie in the puss.

1408
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:53,735
Coach Calhoun, how could you
have flunked the T-Birds?

1409
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,904
Don't worry, you'll get your diplomas.

1410
01:39:55,989 --> 01:39:57,907
All you have to do
is come back to summer school.

1411
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:00,033
Summer school? Look out!

1412
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:05,789
Now see, if you'd have come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

1413
01:40:05,873 --> 01:40:08,417
Wise guy, huh? Take that!

1414
01:40:10,128 --> 01:40:12,963
Why, you couldn't even pitch one inning.

1415
01:40:17,677 --> 01:40:20,095
- What's your name? I want you.
- It's Eugene.

1416
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,305
- You're a great pitcher.
- Oh, thank you.

1417
01:40:31,899 --> 01:40:33,317
Rizzo!

1418
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:34,944
Hey, Rizzo!

1419
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,779
Get off of that thing, you got a condition.

1420
01:40:37,864 --> 01:40:39,990
Forget it. It was a false alarm.

1421
01:40:40,074 --> 01:40:42,034
- What?
- I'm not pregnant.

1422
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:49,332
Yeah, well,
I'll make an honest woman of you.

1423
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:52,920
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

1424
01:40:53,796 --> 01:40:55,797
That's a bona fide offer.

1425
01:40:55,882 --> 01:40:58,592
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses, but...

1426
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:08,185
Hey, there's Zuko.

1427
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:10,270
You gotta be kidding, man!

1428
01:41:12,356 --> 01:41:14,024
Hey, what is this? Halloween?

1429
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:16,359
Where did you swipe
this letterman sweater, huh?

1430
01:41:16,444 --> 01:41:19,072
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

1431
01:41:19,155 --> 01:41:20,448
How do you like that?

1432
01:41:20,532 --> 01:41:23,033
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

1433
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:26,244
- That's right, I did.
- What you doing? Deserting us?

1434
01:41:26,329 --> 01:41:29,498
Well, you guys can't follow a leader
all your lives, can you?

1435
01:41:29,957 --> 01:41:31,083
Oh, come on, guys.

1436
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:33,668
You know you mean a lot to me.
It's just that Sandy does, too

1437
01:41:33,753 --> 01:41:36,338
and I'm gonna do anything I can
to get her, that's all.

1438
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:49,268
Sandy!

1439
01:41:51,104 --> 01:41:53,396
Tell me about it, stud.

1440
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:03,032
I got chills

1441
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,243
They're multiplyin'

1442
01:42:05,327 --> 01:42:09,747
And I'm losin' control

1443
01:42:10,164 --> 01:42:14,167
'Cause the power you're supplyin'

1444
01:42:14,252 --> 01:42:16,503
It's electrifyin'

1445
01:42:23,345 --> 01:42:25,262
You better shape up

1446
01:42:25,972 --> 01:42:27,849
'Cause I need a man

1447
01:42:29,225 --> 01:42:32,353
And my heart is set on you

1448
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,646
You better shape up

1449
01:42:35,064 --> 01:42:37,315
You better understand

1450
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:40,569
To my heart I must be true

1451
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:43,905
Nothin' left,
nothin' left for me to do

1452
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:46,658
- You're the one that I want
- You are the one I want

1453
01:42:46,743 --> 01:42:49,036
You oo oo, honey

1454
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,454

01:42:57,712 --> 01:42:59,462
- are what I need
- What I need

1459
01:42:59,547 --> 01:43:01,631
- Oh, yes, indeed
- Yes, indeed

1460
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:11,016
If you're filled with affection

1461
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:15,145
You're too shy to convey

1462
01:43:15,229 --> 01:43:19,734
Meditate my direction

1463
01:43:20,735 --> 01:43:23,112
- Feel your way
- Wow!

1464
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,448
I better shape up

1465
01:43:26,949 --> 01:43:29,993
- 'Cause you need a man
- I need a man

1466
01:43:30,078 --> 01:43:33,247
Who can keep me satisfied

1467
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:35,750
I better shape up

1468
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:39,045
- If I'm gonna prove
- You better prove

1469
01:43:39,128 --> 01:43:41,631
that my faith is justified

1470
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:45,051
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure down deep inside

1471
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:47,886
- You're the one that I want
- You are the one I want

1472
01:43:47,970 --> 01:43:49,846
You oo oo, honey

1473
01:43:49,931 --> 01:43:52,390

1480
01:44:05,988 --> 01:44:07,989

- The one that I want

You oo oo, honey

1491
01:44:30,721 --> 01:44:32,806
- The one that I want

01:44:57,582 --> 01:44:58,623
You're the one that I want

1504
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:03,378
Hey, everybody.
Rizzo and Kenickie made up.

1505
01:45:03,462 --> 01:45:04,921
All right!

1506
01:45:05,006 --> 01:45:07,757
Oh, look!
Oh, the gang's together.

1507
01:45:07,842 --> 01:45:09,885
Well, what are we gonna do
after graduation?

1508
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:12,595
Yeah, maybe we'll never
see each other again.

1509
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,849
- No, that will never happen.
- How do you know?

1510
01:45:14,932 --> 01:45:16,225
What do you mean how do I know?

1511
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:34,159
We go together like ra-ma

Wha oooh, yeah
