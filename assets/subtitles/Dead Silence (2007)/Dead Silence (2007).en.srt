1
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,051
You fixed it yet?

2
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:46,418
Just a couple more minutes.

3
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,227
You said that an hour ago.

4
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,454
I promised
to make you dinner, right?

5
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,554
Yeah.

6
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,598
Well, I'm making you
a gourmet dinner.

7
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,925
Trust me.
It'll be worth the wait.

8
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,002
Surrender.

9
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:04,937
Hmm?

10
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,604
Surrender to the wonders
of takeout.

11
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,737
Oh.

12
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:10,812
I knew this was coming.

13
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,787
'Cause when your fingers dial
those seven little numbers,

14
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:16,218
it really turns me on.

15
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,449
Is that the best
you can come up with?

16
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:20,651
Yeah.

17
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,387
Wow. You are fast.

18
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,572
Who was it?

19
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,509
I don't know.

20
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,423
It doesn't even say
where it's from.

21
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,721
Well, there's
one way to find out.

22
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,834
Oh, Jamie,
you adopted us a baby.

23
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,377
A baby?
Have you seen this thing?

24
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,839
Well, who would send you
a doll?

25
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,939
I have no idea.

26
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:21,285
There's no card, no note.

27
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,387
His eyes look so real.

28
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,293
"I don't know about you, but
Lisa's hungry for Chinese. "

29
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,064
I think
my wife's gone crazy.

30
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,795
Oh, my God! This reminds me of
that poem from when we were kids.

31
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:38,230
What poem?

32
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:39,665
You remember. Come on.

33
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,504
That old ghost story about the
woman who had all those dolls.

34
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,072
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

35
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:48,872
"She had no children,
only dolls... "

36
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,913
And something,
something scary.

37
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,012
Something, something... Boo!

38
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,317
I think you're having just a
little too much fun there, Lise.

39
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,552
Oh, baby, I won't let
the scary dummy hurt you.

40
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,288
Thank you. Thank you.

41
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,492
If you get Jamie to scream,

42
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:48,406
I'll make sure you get seven minutes
in heaven with my old Barbie. Deal?

43
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,266
"Yes, Lisa. "

44
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,177
God, I'm such a loser.

45
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,963
Good boy.

46
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:51,997
Jamie?

47
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,230
Jamie?

48
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,346
Baby, I'm back.

49
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,595
Lisa! What are you trying
to do? Burn the place down?

50
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:34,321
Lise?

51
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,534
Oh, Lisa.

52
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,206
<i>I'm in here.</i>

53
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:49,311
Dinner in bed again.

54
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,052
Lisa!

55
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,456
<i>Yes, Jamie?</i>

56
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:07,892
What's going on?

57
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,301
<i>I have a surprise for
you, Jamie. For you, Jamie.</i>

58
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,386
Lisa, this is not funny!

59
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:40,850
The strange is that she's
got no defensive wounds.

60
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,191
Now, if somebody was trying to turn
my face into a jack-o'- lantern,

61
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,524
I'd be fighting back a little.

62
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:49,033
Yeah, but then you always have
been a little feisty, my girl.

63
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,196
Ligature marks?

64
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,296
Not a one.

65
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,273
What about...
Drugs?

66
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,707
That's a gift. I think the words
here, and they come out there.

67
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,270
Preliminary results say no.

68
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,317
But the final tox results
won't be in for 48 hours.

69
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:09,842
Personally, I think only someone
high as a kite would kill his wife

70
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,287
and then pose her
as a mannequin.

71
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,187
But the weirdest thing
is her face.

72
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,889
I've never seen
anything like it.

73
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,173
You know what it was?
Your mistake?

74
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,376
It was the rose.

75
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,850
Yep. Boy, I'll tell you,

76
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,645
if I had a dollar for every time
some guy gave his wife a rose

77
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,414
on the day that he,
you know...

78
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,419
Like that's an alibi.

79
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,085
Alibi?

80
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,427
I didn't hear you.
Did you say something?

81
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,561
Why would I need an alibi?

82
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,326
I'm sure your lawyer
would want you to have one.

83
00:13:58,937 --> 00:13:59,961
My lawyer?

84
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,062
Yeah.

85
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,539
I mean, the prosecution, they're
going to have your fingerprints,

86
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,405
no signs of forced entry
on your apartment,

87
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:08,037
and you as the last person
to see your wife alive.

88
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,671
I mean, that's a lot
to go up against.

89
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,940
You think
I killed my wife?

90
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,075
Excuse me?

91
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,181
Do you think
I killed my wife?

92
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,379
No. No, I don't think you did.

93
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,655
I'm just trying
to help your lawyer out.

94
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,956
I mean, he's going to need
something more concrete.

95
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:27,088
I mean, at least to shift
the suspicion away from you.

96
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,927
Suspicion? I mean, if you
want to talk suspicion,

97
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,799
why don't you start by looking at the
package that turned up on my doorstep?

98
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,340
Oh, yeah.
That package, right.

99
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,735
Let's see. You received
an unmarked package

100
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,573
just moments
before Lisa was killed.

101
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,841
Yeah. A package containing
a ventriloquist dummy.

102
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,211
Ventriloquist dummy. Yeah.

103
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,081
Well, the mystery toy
department is down the hall.

104
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,022
This is
the homicide department.

105
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,488
So unless you can tell me
how some puppet

106
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:56,585
ties into your wife's murder,
I don't see the relevance.

107
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,962
In the town where I'm from,

108
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,903
a ventriloquist dummy
is a bad omen.

109
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,267
It's kind of a local legend,

110
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,100
and some people believe that the dummy
brings death to those around them.

111
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,642
Okay.

112
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,609
Well, Jamie,

113
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,118
I've never arrested a dummy
for murder before.

114
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,152
But I have arrested
quite a few husbands.

115
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,687
You don't think it's weird
that this package arrives

116
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,129
right before Lisa is killed?

117
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:36,496
No, I'll tell you
what I think is weird.

118
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:41,129
You said that your wife spoke to you
just moments before you found her, right?

119
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,500
Yeah. Yeah. But she didn't have a tongue.

120
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:47,174
In fact, according to you,
she was already dead.

121
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,914
Now, see, to me, that's weird.

122
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,219
So, what're you going to do?
Arrest me?

123
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,245
Not yet.

124
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,351
Look, you can go, Ashen.

125
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,219
You're a free man for now.

126
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,388
Good.

127
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:12,764
It'll give me more time
to do your job for you.

128
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,273
Jamie!

129
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,378
I'm so sorry for your loss.

130
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,587
But I'm so glad
to have you home.

131
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,347
Oh!

132
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,757
My Lord, you must think I'm so rude.

133
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,160
We haven't even
been introduced.

134
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:26,595
I'm Ella.

135
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,688
I'm...

136
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,298
Well, I guess
I'm your stepmother.

137
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:35,265
Is he in?

138
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,671
Yes, he is.

139
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,734
Please come in.

140
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:39,867
Thanks.

141
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,345
There are some things that you
need to know about your father.

142
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:43,938
I know everything I need to.

143
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,583
Ella!
Who's down there with you?

144
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,482
Your father won't
fight you, Jamie.

145
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,578
He doesn't fight anyone,
not anymore.

146
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,124
Well, then you're not
married to my father.

147
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,352
Ella!

148
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,260
I can hear you.

149
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,798
Goddamn chair is stuck.

150
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,534
Here, Edward,
let me help you.

151
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,912
My son.
What a pleasant surprise.

152
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:25,682
What happened to you?

153
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,781
Your father had a stroke
two months ago.

154
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,622
Why didn't anybody tell me?

155
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,390
You never return my calls.

156
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,855
It's because I never know
what to say to you.

157
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:38,663
I take it I wasn't the easiest
person to get along with in the past,

158
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,029
but I've changed.
Really?

159
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:43,801
Yes. A stroke can do that
to a man.

160
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,740
Listen, I'm sorry
about your wife.

161
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:50,377
I hear you've
brought her home.

162
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,109
Yeah.
Don't worry.

163
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:54,743
I'll call Henry Walker,
make the arrangements.

164
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,583
No, that's okay,
I can take care of it.

165
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:59,852
Jamie, please. As your father,
it's the least I can do.

166
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:01,915
You've done the least
you can do my whole life.

167
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,258
It's too late
for charity now.

168
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:06,259
Is that why you've come here,

169
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,924
to remind me what a bad
father I've been to you?

170
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,698
In light of what has happened, I was
hoping we could put that in the past.

171
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,739
I didn't come
to talk about that, I...

172
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,967
I came to ask you something.

173
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,375
Do you remember when I was a
kid, Mom used to read me a poem?

174
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,607
Do you remember what it was?

175
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,349
What poem?

176
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,181
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

177
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,148
"She had no children,
only dolls

178
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,987
"And if you see her
in your dreams... "

179
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,095
"Be sure you never,
ever scream"

180
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:42,291
You know it?

181
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,461
It's just a scary poem parents would
tell their kids to keep them in line.

182
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:49,404
No. It's more than just a ghost story.
And the adults believed in it, as well.

183
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:51,806
We live
in a small town, Jamie.

184
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:55,339
Small minds breed
small-minded superstitions.

185
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,382
That's all.
There's nothing else to tell.

186
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,472
Nothing?

187
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:59,574
Edward,

188
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,615
your son has been
through a lot.

189
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:04,211
Why don't we make up
a room for him?

190
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,250
No, that's okay.
I'm not staying long.

191
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:09,718
I got a funeral to prepare.

192
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,729
Jamie, Jamie!

193
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:16,124
Jamie! Please wait.

194
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:18,633
Won't you stay the night here?

195
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,568
It was nice meeting you, Ella.

196
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:23,607
Your father's changed. He's not
the same man that you remember.

197
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:24,936
Really?

198
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,545
You see that?

199
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:33,106
Mom used to be in that picture with
us, until he drove her to kill herself.

200
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:35,914
Had his second wife
in that one there.

201
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,086
But she was smart enough
to leave.

202
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:40,521
So, it's a good thing you're
going to outlive him, lady.

203
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,152
There'll be no one
to paint you out.

204
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,232
What more?

205
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,802
What more do you
want from me?

206
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,539
Peck, peck, peck,
peck, peck, peck.

207
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:04,010
I must say I was deeply
saddened to hear the news.

208
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:09,951
If you're up to it, I can walk you
through the various casket options we have.

209
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,019
Or we can do it later.

210
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,554
It's okay.
Let's... Let's do it now.

211
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,060
Okay. Now, I don't know
what your preferences are.

212
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:22,932
Have you spoken
to her family yet?

213
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:27,598
Only once. We didn't really
talk about casket choices.

214
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,303
When is she arriving?

215
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,509
Tonight.

216
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:40,040
Once the police have released
her body, then I'll pick her up.

217
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:46,618
Oh, I'll need you to fill out
these forms, at your convenience.

218
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,136
<i>Jamie.</i>

219
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,574
<i>Jamie!</i>

220
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,599
No, it can't be.

221
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,638
Marion?

222
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,346
Marion, is that you?

223
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,552
Marion, I told you
not to go down there anymore.

224
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,992
The silent time's here.

225
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,723
Now, come out of there
and go to bed.

226
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,355
She's here now.

227
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,825
I know it.

228
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:50,959
Marion,

229
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,003
I don't have time
to play games.

230
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,902
She won't find me down here.

231
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:57,237
Marion, I'm not
going to ask you again.

232
00:27:57,608 --> 00:27:59,974
Let's go. Come on, come on.

233
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,951
You just shush now.

234
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,846
The silent time is here.

235
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,980
Go on.

236
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,990
Go on up. I'll be up later.

237
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,022
Did you see her? Did you?

238
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,153
When she killed your wife?
Did you see her do it?

239
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,323
Killed my wife?
What are you talking about?

240
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:04,163
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

241
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,835
"She had no children,
only dolls

242
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,131
"And if you see her
in your dreams... "

243
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,434
Marion!

244
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,675
She's here. No one's safe.

245
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:13,938
No one's safe.
Come, Marion.

246
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:16,480
Marion, you leave him alone.
No one's safe.

247
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,913
This is not the time.
What's she talking about?

248
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:21,109
I'm sorry, Jamie. She doesn't
know what she's saying.

249
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,210
She's here!

250
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,450
Come. I'm going to take you home
now. Let's go, let's go. Come on.

251
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:28,923
You must bury the doll!
Bury the doll!

252
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:31,253
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone. Come on.

253
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,089
Marion, we'll go home now.

254
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,874
Who dug you up?

255
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:26,047
Thought I asked you
not to leave the city.

256
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,889
I came to bury my wife.
You got a problem with that?

257
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,050
Nope.

258
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:36,590
Problem is, she's not the
only one that you came to bury.

259
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:38,867
So, you've been
following me now?

260
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:43,197
You know, Jamie,
you really are forcing me

261
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:46,471
to use the word "perplexed"
an awful lot lately.

262
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,643
You mind telling me
what the hell that is?

263
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:57,710
Okay. Since you don't want
to answer my questions,

264
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,885
maybe you'd like
to answer his.

265
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,686
"Why did you bury me, Jamie?

266
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,324
"Is it because I'm evidence
in a capital crime,

267
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:14,231
"a crime that you are
the number one suspect in?"

268
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:23,043
You understand
what I'm saying here?

269
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,081
It's like I told you before.

270
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:28,380
The night Lisa was murdered,
somebody sent it to me.

271
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,715
It just arrived
on our doorstep.

272
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,715
So, why'd you bury it?

273
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:35,623
It came from that cemetery.
I was just putting it back.

274
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,057
In the cemetery?

275
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:42,097
There's an old ghost story around
here about a woman named Mary Shaw.

276
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,065
She was buried
with her doll collection.

277
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,934
Now, the story goes, "If you ever
see her, make sure you never scream. "

278
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,266
Or what?

279
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:51,634
Oh.

280
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:54,603
Or you end up
without a tongue.

281
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,474
I guess your wife
didn't listen, then, huh?

282
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,605
You son of a...

283
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:58,739
Hey! Hey!

284
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:00,280
Settle down, Jamie.

285
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:04,184
Let's not add assaulting an officer
to your list of offenses here.

286
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,253
So you're trying to tell me
that a ghost killed your wife?

287
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,951
I don't know,
I don't know.

288
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:12,188
What do you know?

289
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:13,753
I do know
whoever sent this to me

290
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,458
either knows who killed my
wife or did it themselves.

291
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,025
Hmm.

292
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:19,900
That's a theory.

293
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,063
I'm going to go.

294
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:27,338
And I hope you don't mind me taking
our little friend here with me,

295
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,407
seeing as he's evidence
and all.

296
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,106
Great.

297
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:35,983
Good night, neighbor.

298
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:43,923
Neighbor?

299
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,231
Sleep tight.

300
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,483
You know, I noticed
you have very smooth skin.

301
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,588
What's your secret?

302
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,657
Oh.

303
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,931
Well, that never works for me.

304
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,775
Friend of yours?

305
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:11,480
You said Mary Shaw
killed my wife.

306
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:13,615
Why would you say that?

307
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,672
Marion.

308
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,550
Marion, please!

309
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,119
Yes, I know, I know...

310
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,487
What do you know
about Mary Shaw?

311
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,853
I didn't say anything! I...

312
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:31,331
You're... You're not
supposed to have that.

313
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,195
Where did you get that?

314
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:35,170
Maybe you can tell me.

315
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:37,864
It's hers!

316
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,034
Who? Mary Shaw's?

317
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,309
We don't say her name
around here.

318
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,818
You don't say her name.
Well, why don't you try, huh?

319
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,547
It might just help me
find out who killed my wife.

320
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,923
There are things you remember, and
there are things you can't forget.

321
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,527
Like the look on that
woman's face when she died.

322
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:12,202
Her name was Mary Shaw, the
ventriloquist who lost her voice.

323
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:17,170
Back when I was a boy, those were
the glory days of Ravens Fair,

324
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,643
<i>and the town built itself
a grand old theater,</i>

325
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:24,675
<i>the Guignol Theater,
out on Lost Lake.</i>

326
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:29,125
<i>I only ever went there once.</i>

327
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:37,634
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to be astounded.

328
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,965
Prepare to be amazed.

329
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:45,338
Witness Mary Shaw give life
to the boy made of wood.

330
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,157
Where is Billy?

331
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,282
Billy!

332
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:07,157
Where are you, Billy?

333
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,597
You won't find me, Mother!

334
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:15,228
I knew
you were hiding out there!

335
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:17,237
You, there!

336
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:23,440
Could you check
under your seat for me?

337
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,815
He's here!

338
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,456
Would you mind
bringing him to me?

339
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,094
Good boy.

340
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:49,905
Say thank you.

341
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,237
Thank you, Henry.

342
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,840
Is that right, young man?

343
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,807
Is your name Henry?

344
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,418
Well, I guess my boy's
had his eye on you.

345
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:11,351
Now, why did you
run away, Billy?

346
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:13,697
Don't I treat you well?

347
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,356
Oh, yes, you're the best
mother I could ever hope for!

348
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:21,969
It's just that it gets so
dusty inside that little box,

349
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:23,532
it makes me want to...

350
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,233
Want to what?
Want to...

351
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,434
Want to...

352
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:33,976
Oh, Billy!

353
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:37,380
You sneezed all over my shoe!

354
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:42,753
I'm sorry, Mother.
I can't help it.

355
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,817
I can see
your lips moving!

356
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,260
What?

357
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,403
Who said that?

358
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,063
I did. I can see it.

359
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,831
Her lips are moving.

360
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,335
What do you say
to that, Billy?

361
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,780
Young Michael here doesn't
think you're a real person!

362
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,315
What do you mean, Mother?

363
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,181
He thinks you're a dummy,

364
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,947
and that I'm doing
your voice for you.

365
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:17,360
But that can't be true!

366
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,588
There's no way you'd give me
all the good lines!

367
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,596
Forget about him, Billy!

368
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,793
There will always be doubters!

369
00:43:26,202 --> 00:43:28,170
I don't want
to forget, Mother!

370
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,768
I think we should show
this boy just how real I am.

371
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:32,900
I'm just as real as him!

372
00:43:32,976 --> 00:43:34,034
No.

373
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,978
I'm afraid we must go on with the show.

374
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,572
No! I'm as real as you are,
and I'll show you!

375
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,673
Leave him alone, Billy!

376
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:41,809
I'll show him
what it's like, Mother!

377
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,112
Listen to me! That's enough!

378
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:44,210
I'm as real as you!

379
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,880
No more!
Bring him up here!

380
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,800
Now who's the dummy?

381
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:08,576
Some weeks later, that disbelieving
little boy went missing.

382
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,739
Gone without a trace.

383
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:16,585
But I always felt that Mary
Shaw played some role in it.

384
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:20,119
And not long after that,
she was murdered.

385
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:22,355
Who killed her?

386
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:23,653
No one ever found out.

387
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:28,927
In her will, Mary stated that her
dummies were to be buried with her,

388
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:32,891
her children,
as she called them.

389
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:34,699
All 101 of them.

390
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:41,940
<i>Her body was brought
to my father's mortuary,</i>

391
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:46,548
so he could begin work
on her other final request.

392
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:54,054
Not only did she ask
to be buried with her dolls,

393
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,920
she asked to become
a doll herself.

394
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:06,916
Henry, are you all right?

395
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:13,786
Ever since she was buried, Ravens
Fair has been plagued by death,

396
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:16,295
families murdered.

397
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,998
They were found
without their tongues.

398
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:28,007
Posed in family portraits.

399
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,148
Your wife's is the last.

400
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,757
How could you take
these pictures?

401
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,693
No, I have to take pictures.
It's part of my business.

402
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:50,063
Who would have dug up
the dummy and sent it to me?

403
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:51,498
I don't know.

404
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,929
No one in this town dares
speak Mary Shaw's name,

405
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:00,135
let alone go near her grave.

406
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:05,375
They know she won't stop
killing until the screaming does.

407
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:10,284
You said she lived out
at that old theater, right?

408
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,411
The one on Lost Lake?

409
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:12,545
Jamie!

410
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,347
Jamie, please!

411
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:19,789
Please be careful.

412
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:24,260
If you go looking for answers,
you just might find them.

413
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,766
That's what I'm counting on.

414
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,291
Morning, Mary.

415
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:03,202
I'm just going to go
check in on the kids.

416
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:25,635
<i>Mama! Mama! Mama.</i>

417
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:08,143
What do you want
with him? What is it?

418
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,043
What do you want?
We did what you wanted.

419
00:54:11,213 --> 00:54:14,581
We put you in there with
your family, all together.

420
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,652
Why can't you
just leave us alone?

421
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,244
<i>Why won't you?</i>

422
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,784
I didn't do anything!

423
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,059
<i>Yes, you did. You talked.</i>

424
00:54:24,293 --> 00:54:25,625
I didn't talk! I didn't!

425
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:29,088
I didn't say anything!
I didn't!

426
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:33,527
Hey!

427
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,762
Say something.

428
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,436
Why have you gone so quiet?

429
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,905
I'm putting you back where
you belong, once and for all!

430
00:54:45,981 --> 00:54:47,278
He talked to me!
Stop it!

431
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:50,045
He did, he talked to me,
he talked to me.

432
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,858
Marion?

433
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:46,271
Marion, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

434
00:56:01,423 --> 00:56:02,686
Marion?

435
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,693
You don't have
to hide anymore.

436
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:08,594
This will all be over soon.

437
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:11,693
Marion?

438
00:56:13,068 --> 00:56:14,126
Marion?

439
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,239
Marion, now
you come on out now!

440
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,052
Ma...

441
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:45,264
Marion?

442
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,768
Marion, open the door.

443
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,744
Marion! Come on,
no games, Marion!

444
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,443
Open the door!

445
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,869
Marion, open this door,
please! Marion!

446
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,101
<i>Hello, Henry!</i>

447
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,001
Oh, my God.

448
00:58:13,422 --> 00:58:17,222
<i>You're voice
is mine now, Henry.</i>

449
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,103
Jamie, you're
just in time for dinner.

450
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:36,202
I'm not hungry.

451
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:37,336
It's soup.

452
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,677
Delicious, too,
if I must say so myself.

453
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:41,443
I'll vouch for that.

454
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,420
I didn't come here to eat,
I came to talk

455
00:58:44,853 --> 00:58:46,219
about Mary Shaw.

456
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,382
You lied to me.

457
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,516
No, I didn't.

458
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,023
Sit down.
No, I want the truth.

459
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:57,623
What does Michael Ashen and our
family have to do with Mary Shaw?

460
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,827
Fine.

461
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,871
When he was a boy,

462
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,001
your great-uncle, Michael
Ashen, vanished without a trace.

463
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,706
For our family, there
was only ever one suspect,

464
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,041
Mary Shaw.

465
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,081
So, they dealt
their own justice.

466
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:22,615
<i>They forced her to scream.</i>

467
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,920
Then cut out her tongue.

468
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,661
Our family killed her?

469
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:31,699
Along with others
from Ravens Fair.

470
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,760
But she didn't stay dead.

471
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,501
She came back
and took her revenge.

472
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:44,543
One by one, each of the men
involved were killed.

473
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:47,373
Their tongues ripped out.

474
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:50,474
And then the same thing
happened to their wives.

475
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:53,346
And then their children.

476
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:55,481
And their children's children.

477
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:58,617
All these years you've resented
me for sending you away,

478
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,891
but I did it to distance you
from this curse.

479
01:00:02,731 --> 01:00:04,028
Distance?

480
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,697
Well, it found Lisa!

481
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,396
Lisa's death made me realize
we can't run from our fate.

482
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,875
Spirits have long memories.

483
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,137
She'll come for us in the end.

484
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:19,481
Now I'm paying
for the sins of my fathers.

485
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:21,106
Jamie, I'm sorry.

486
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:25,652
All I ever meant to do was to protect
you, even if it earned your hatred.

487
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,849
I don't know how,
but one way or another,

488
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,119
I'm going to stop this thing.

489
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,628
Please, Son!

490
01:00:35,063 --> 01:00:36,394
Well, hey, there!

491
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:39,367
I was wondering if you could help
me with a missing person's case.

492
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:40,458
Wait.

493
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,297
I'm looking for a male, brown
hair, he's around this tall,

494
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:47,298
sometimes seen
with a hand up his ass.

495
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:51,943
Actually, his brothers and sisters
have just gone missing, too.

496
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:53,746
What are you talking about?

497
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:54,907
Somebody dug them up.

498
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:57,376
All 100 of them.

499
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,284
What I want to know is
who did it and why.

500
01:01:01,356 --> 01:01:02,619
So do I!

501
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,295
Don't give me some ghost story about
a woman who kills you if you scream,

502
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,588
because nobody in this town
has ever heard of Mary Shaw

503
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:09,791
or your little fairy tale.

504
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:10,889
They're lying!

505
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,262
They're afraid!

506
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,393
Afraid of what?

507
01:01:13,802 --> 01:01:15,134
Afraid of ghosts?

508
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:18,900
Or are they afraid of talking to the cop
who's investigating your wife's murder?

509
01:01:18,974 --> 01:01:21,273
They have no reason
to protect me.

510
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,371
But they believe in Mary Shaw.

511
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,775
That's why they won't answer
your stupid questions.

512
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:30,250
No, it's you who won't
answer my questions, Jamie.

513
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:32,184
That's why I'm going to arrest
you for stealing evidence.

514
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,744
Then I'm going to sit
you down, and you will...

515
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:36,155
What do you want
me to tell you?

516
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:38,485
Something less perplexing
than a ghost story. Come on.

517
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,795
Jamie, is everything
all right?

518
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,032
It's for you.
They said it was urgent.

519
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,465
Go ahead.

520
01:01:55,143 --> 01:01:56,304
<i>Hello?
Jamie.</i>

521
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:57,804
Who is this?

522
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:00,878
<i>Jamie?</i>

523
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,039
Henry?

524
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,045
<i>I can prove it.</i>

525
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:06,485
Henry, I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

526
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,088
<i>I can prove it.</i>

527
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:10,784
<i>I can... you didn't kill her.</i>

528
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,224
<i>There's a way, at the theater.</i>

529
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,356
<i>Meet me at the theater.
It's on Lost Lake.</i>

530
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:17,728
Yeah, I know where it is.

531
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,733
<i>Now, Jamie.</i>

532
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,963
Henry, wait!
What have you found?

533
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:25,731
Henry! Henry!

534
01:02:30,378 --> 01:02:32,108
That was Henry Walker
from the funeral home.

535
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,512
He says he can prove
I didn't kill my wife.

536
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,677
Convenient time for him to call. Let's go.

537
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,744
Wait, wait, wait. I'm going
to meet him at the theater.

538
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,844
That's where I'm going.

539
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,014
No, you're going with me.

540
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,556
Your appointment
with me comes first.

541
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,059
You wanted answers.
I'm giving you answers.

542
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:48,119
Camp is over. I'm done with
the ghost stories. Let's go.

543
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,822
Listen, we're talking
about my wife here. Come on.

544
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,996
Do us both a favor, Jamie.

545
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,500
Don't make me cuff you
in front of your mom.

546
01:03:05,313 --> 01:03:06,541
Jamie!

547
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,976
Jamie. Jamie!

548
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,153
Hey, you don't want
to make me chase you!

549
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,210
Jamie!

550
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,827
I don't have
a full tank of gas!

551
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:25,251
Jamie!

552
01:04:31,766 --> 01:04:32,858
Henry?

553
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,130
Jamie!

554
01:04:51,086 --> 01:04:52,144
Hello?

555
01:04:53,255 --> 01:04:54,780
Where are you?

556
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:57,652
Henry?

557
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:06,956
Henry?

558
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:21,480
Henry?

559
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:25,085
<i>Come on, Jamie.
I'm up here.</i>

560
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,813
I'm coming, Jamie.

561
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,315
Jamie?

562
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:07,391
I know you're here.

563
01:06:09,931 --> 01:06:11,422
<i>I'm in here.</i>

564
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:31,445
Henry?

565
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:49,695
Henry?

566
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:50,829
Guess again.

567
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,202
He's here.

568
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,177
Nobody's here. Our boats
were the only two out there.

569
01:06:58,246 --> 01:06:59,873
Listen, I'm telling you
he's here!

570
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,074
And I'm telling you

571
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,617
he is not here!

572
01:07:03,885 --> 01:07:05,376
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

573
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,619
If you say I told you so,
I'll shoot you.

574
01:07:17,365 --> 01:07:18,856
Where the hell are you?

575
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,282
Hang on to this for a second.

576
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,226
Where are you going?

577
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,744
Remember, whatever happens,

578
01:08:05,246 --> 01:08:06,373
don't scream.

579
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:12,449
Jamie. Jamie?

580
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:17,917
Jamie?

581
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:21,354
Jamie!

582
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,260
You follow me.

583
01:08:30,338 --> 01:08:31,430
Yes, sir.

584
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:28,453
All right, Jamie,
where is he?

585
01:09:39,073 --> 01:09:41,304
You know, if I see
one more of these...

586
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:56,448
They're all here.

587
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:12,899
Yep.

588
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:16,934
All home.

589
01:10:27,155 --> 01:10:29,488
Someone brought them
back here.

590
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,631
All but one.

591
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:46,199
What?

592
01:10:50,078 --> 01:10:51,546
What the hell is that?

593
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,805
Is that a doll?

594
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:25,336
It's not a doll.

595
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:29,146
It's a boy.

596
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,122
You mean, it was a boy.

597
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:51,204
It's me.
All right, I get it.

598
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:55,608
I think we just solved a
70-year-old missing person's case.

599
01:11:55,677 --> 01:11:57,202
Who was that?

600
01:11:59,547 --> 01:12:01,378
A long-lost relative.

601
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,377
This is how it starts.

602
01:12:10,091 --> 01:12:11,684
What's going on here, Jamie?

603
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:40,949
Jamie.

604
01:13:21,229 --> 01:13:22,720
What the...

605
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,555
Mary Shaw?

606
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,139
Mary Shaw?

607
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:12,912
<i>Clever.</i>

608
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:16,380
Who's there?

609
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:17,743
Show yourself!

610
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:19,212
Come out!

611
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,087
What do you want?

612
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:32,563
<i>To silence all those
who silenced me.</i>

613
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:37,064
Is that why you killed
Michael Ashen?

614
01:14:37,805 --> 01:14:41,037
<i>So hard to construct</i>

615
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:43,707
<i>the perfect doll.</i>

616
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:48,972
<i>Sometimes you have
to use existing parts.</i>

617
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:53,347
"I love you, Mommy.
I love you, Mommy. "

618
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:54,681
<i>"I love you.</i>

619
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:57,154
<i>"I love you, Mommy. "</i>

620
01:14:58,359 --> 01:14:59,520
Why Lisa?

621
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,759
Why did you take her from me?

622
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:09,170
<i>Come closer and I'll tell you.</i>

623
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,676
Don't go back there. Don't.

624
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,904
Come on, come on. Don't go.

625
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:31,291
<i>Come closer.</i>

626
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,189
<i>I'll whisper it to you.</i>

627
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:02,118
<i>You weren't the last Ashen.</i>

628
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:07,354
<i>The last Ashen was inside her.</i>

629
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,126
Don't scream.

630
01:16:58,579 --> 01:16:59,604
The doll!

631
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,815
What the hell's
going on here, Jamie?

632
01:17:08,756 --> 01:17:09,951
What's going on?

633
01:17:10,024 --> 01:17:11,082
She's living in the dolls!

634
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:12,182
What?

635
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,591
She's living in the dolls!

636
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,091
Destroy the dolls!

637
01:17:17,164 --> 01:17:18,222
I am!

638
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,500
All of the dolls!

639
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,009
Jamie! Run!

640
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:52,591
Come on!

641
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:35,623
One left.

642
01:20:59,587 --> 01:21:00,815
Henry!

643
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:05,216
Henry!

644
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:15,832
Please. Please.

645
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,948
Please.

646
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,306
Please.

647
01:21:32,386 --> 01:21:35,378
Please say

648
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,317
something.

649
01:21:37,391 --> 01:21:38,449
Shit.

650
01:21:41,262 --> 01:21:44,288
Marion. Marion, listen to me.
Where is the dummy?

651
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,359
He took it.
Who took it?

652
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:47,422
Who took it?

653
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,025
Mr. Ashen.

654
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:50,400
Mr...

655
01:21:50,838 --> 01:21:53,273
Marion, my father
is in a wheelchair.

656
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:55,365
He never leaves the house.

657
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:59,411
He left this house.
He had the doll.

658
01:22:00,481 --> 01:22:02,609
It was him.

659
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,715
<i>Why did you
bury me, Jamie?</i>

660
01:23:52,726 --> 01:23:54,194
<i>I'm in here!</i>

661
01:25:37,498 --> 01:25:38,556
Dad?

662
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:55,007
I take it I wasn't the easiest
person to get along with in the past,

663
01:25:55,082 --> 01:25:56,380
but I've changed.

664
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:57,645
Jamie!

665
01:25:58,485 --> 01:26:00,248
<i>Soup! Delicious, too.</i>

666
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,685
<i>I'll vouch for that.</i>

667
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,627
<i>Jamie, I can prove
you didn't kill her.</i>

668
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:14,891
<i>Jamie!
So glad to have you home.</i>

669
01:26:31,418 --> 01:26:34,046
Now who's the dummy?

670
01:26:35,756 --> 01:26:39,090
No!

671
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,605
<i>"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw</i>

672
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:01,545
<i>"She had no children,
only dolls</i>

673
01:27:02,716 --> 01:27:05,117
<i>"And if you see her
in your dreams</i>

674
01:27:05,185 --> 01:27:08,712
<i>"Be sure you never,
ever, scream"</i>
