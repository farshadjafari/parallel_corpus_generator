Thank you.
I really appreciate this.

00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:35,104
I think Stephanie is, uh...

51
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,114
a lesbian.

52
00:57:37,182 --> 00:57:38,706
Uh-huh?

53
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:41,081
Does that make
a difference what she-

54
00:57:41,152 --> 00:57:42,949
No.

55
00:57:43,021 --> 00:57:47,014
- It's cool.
- I mean, or maybe it's all in my head. I don't know.

56
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:52,129
Oh, wow. What about this?

57
00:57:52,197 --> 00:57:54,722

- Um-
- That looks perfect, huh?

59
00:57:58,036 --> 00:58:00,129
Well-

60
00:58:00,205 --> 00:58:04,232
I mean, it's winter, so maybe you want
something warmer, like a peacoat.

61
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:06,436
You got a point there.

62
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:09,378
- If you know her size.
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.

63
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:12,211
I don't know, man.
I think that's pretty rock and roll.

64
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:15,775
- What do you think?
- L-

65
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:18,855
You should go with your gut, man.

00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:20,413
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

67
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:24,154

Well, it's not something
I usually tell the customers.

78
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:57,818
It's not exactly-
It's not a turn-on.

79
00:58:59,364 --> 00:59:01,855
Uh, hold on.
Wait a second.

80
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:14,174
I want you to give this
to your little guy. It's a-

I think so.

88
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:39,165
Well, I can see where
he got his good looks from.

#If you've ever seen a one-trick pony
then you've seen me #

710
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:34,550
#Have you ever seen
a one-legged dog #

711
01:45:34,623 --> 01:45:38,354

#I always leave with less
than I had before #

#Then you've seen me #

718
01:45:58,947 --> 01:46:03,543
#Bet I can make you smile
when the blood it hits the floor#

719
01:46:05,787 --> 01:46:09,985
#Tell me, friend
can you ask for anything more #

720

#Filled with nothin'
but dust and weeds #

723
01:46:34,249 --> 01:46:38,777
#If you've ever seen that scarecrow
then you've seen me #

724

#Have you ever seen
a one-armed man #

725
01:46:43,425 --> 01:46:46,917
#Punchin'at nothin'
but the breeze #
