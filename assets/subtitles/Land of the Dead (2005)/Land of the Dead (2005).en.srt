1
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,119
...dead people...

2
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,220
...the recently departed...

3
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,822
Unburied human corpses
are returning to life...

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,265
and feeding on the living.

5
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,392
Stay inside.

6
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,130
Do not try to leave your homes.

7
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,536
They seem to survive
by eating human flesh.

8
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,801
Everyone who dies will
become one of them.

9
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,002
If you are bitten, you will
just become one of them...

10
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,739
that much sooner.

11
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,146
They're not your neighbors
and friends, not anymore.

12
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,707
My wife had a heart attack.

13
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,753
Got up and came after me
like a banshee from hell.

14
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,618
I put a curling iron through her head.

15
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,782
...the head... the brain...

16
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,849
They must be destroyed
as quickly as possible.

17
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,986
There's no time for
funeral arrangements.

18
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,689
There's no time to dig up holes...

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,391
so you can drop these
things in the ground.

20
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,660
As long as we're alive...

21
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,166
they ain't never gonna run out of food.

22
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,500
The day they do, it'll mean
only one thing: We're all dead.

23
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,573
This is not only a local
or a regional phenomenon.

24
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,404
Cities are under siege.

25
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,938
If these creatures ever
develop the power to think...

26
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,040
to reason...

27
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,450
even in the most primitive way...

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,511
People are said to be establishing...

29
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,749
outposts in big cities...

30
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,623
and raiding small rural towns
for supplies, like outlaws.

31
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,433
¢Ü¢Ü

32
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,568
They're trying to be us.

33
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,473
No, they used to be us.

34
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,535
Learning how to be us again.

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,979
No way. Some germ or some devil
got those things up and walking...

36
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,952
but there's a big difference
between us and them.

37
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,411
They're dead.

38
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,618
It's like they're
pretending to be alive.

39
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,028
Isn't that what we're doing,
pretending to be alive?

40
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,134
He knows we're here.

41
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,541
Christ.

42
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,242
It's like he's talking to them.

43
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,179
Let's go.

44
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,068
A whole lot of trash this
week. That's life, bro.

45
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,975
Whole lot of trash, trick
is not to get in with it.

46
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,391
You any good with that, kid?
Because I'm real good with mine.

47
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,560
Put it away, Charlie.
Don't be so jumpy, kid.

48
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,764
What are you doing?

49
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,602
Watching your back. I don't like
it when you go off without me.

50
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,905
I told you to get things
ready. I got things ready...

51
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,309
then I come to watch your back.

52
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,271
Christ! This is like a bad dream.

53
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,646
I have bad dreams.

54
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,647
Hell, yes. Just look at me, you
can tell I have terrible dreams.

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,449
Riley, what's your 20?

56
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,580
We checked out the town.

57
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,352
There's plenty of supplies, but
a lot of walkers. Where's Cholo?

58
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,291
He dumped the trash,
and he's on his way back.

59
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,658
We're ready to go in. Okay.

60
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,856
Put some flowers in the graveyard.

61
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,599
"Flowers in the graveyard."
Why do you call them that, Riley?

62
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,729
I don't get it.

63
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,832
These here flowers ain't the
kind you lay down on the ground.

64
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,106
These here are sky
flowers, way up in heaven.

65
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,148
That's why I love you, Charlie.
Because you still believe in heaven.

66
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,614
Lord, yeah.

67
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,613
I mean, look.

68
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,519
Nice driving.

69
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,646
Riley, looks like God's left the
phone off the hook, huh, baby?

70
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,988
Go get my ride. Get yours, too.

71
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,652
What's the matter? You
look like shit, man.

72
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,956
Didn't I tell you not to bang chicks...

73
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,429
with problems worse than you?
When are going to listen me?

74
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,764
You done? I'm never done, baby. Why?

75
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,070
The town's full of walkers.

76
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,696
Yeah, but every town is full of walkers.

77
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,640
No, these guys are not just walking.
It's like they're communicating.

78
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,973
They're thinking, and
there's something going on.

79
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,978
But they're dumb, Riley.

80
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,613
Well, hell. Dead folks
is near as dumb as me.

81
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,651
You learned to make
yourself useful, didn't you?

82
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,050
Yeah. That's what they're doing.

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,212
Make yourself useful.

84
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,415
You don't got one redeeming
defect, do you, son, huh?

85
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,516
I got this! I got this! You
got that? You got that, too.

86
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,061
Come on. Let's get to work before I
forget what it is I do for a living.

87
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,859
Cholo, I'm talking to you.

88
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,701
All right, what? Things are changing.

89
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,397
Just be careful. We
go in, we do our job...

90
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,770
and we get the fuck out
of there. Everyone alive.

91
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,708
Now, you take command of this unit,
you can run it any way you like.

92
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,338
But tonight, it's my last night
out. I don't want any fuck-ups.

93
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,605
So, that's what it's about?

94
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,151
You're not going to dump these
recycled delinquents on me.

95
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,880
I don't want to take command.

96
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,048
Because you know what? Tonight's
my last night, too, baby.

97
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,852
Hey, you. Come here,
you little nose-picker.

98
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,952
You been with Riley all
day painting the town beige?

99
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,929
I'm gonna show you
how it's done. Come on.

100
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,197
What'd he do, win the
lottery or something?

101
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,234
Something.

102
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,867
How come you guys
always go out at night?

103
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,466
Wouldn't it be safer in the daytime?

104
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,076
Fireworks, kid. Stenches
can't keep their eyes off them.

105
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,976
Come on!

106
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,003
Yeah!

107
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,398
That sucker's mine, baby.

108
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,136
I got that one.

109
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,959
Number 1, how's the
food? Mostly canned stuff.

110
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,355
I'd stay away from the fish.

111
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,293
Number 2, what's your location?

112
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,427
Drugstore.

113
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,232
Need an aspirin? I
got a million of them.

114
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,398
Antibiotics. We need antibiotics.

115
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,143
They're gone. The sky
flowers, they're gone.

116
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,244
That's not good, is
it? No, it's not good.

117
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,364
Sorry, Riley, I should
have seen that thing.

118
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,600
Nice shooting. That's
good shooting, Charlie.

119
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,198
No such thing as nice shooting.

120
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,868
Pretty Boy, what the fuck is going on?

121
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,106
Fireworks are jammed.
We're getting on it.

122
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,704
Shut her down!

123
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,844
Everyone, out of town.

124
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,479
Let's move! Go! Drive!

125
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,918
Go!

126
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:02,985
Two minutes!

127
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,927
Pretty Boy, lay down some cover.

128
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,124
Get on the guns!

129
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,518
I thought this was going to be a
battle. It's a fucking massacre.

130
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,004
Cholo, we got a problem.
Fireworks are down.

131
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,276
It's nice and peaceful, ain't
it? Cholo, where are you?

132
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,107
I'm just getting some supplies,
some essential supplies...

133
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,177
just like my job description entails.

134
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,518
Nothing in there but booze.
Booze ain't essential.

135
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,456
A jug of good Kentucky goes
for $1,500 back in town.

136
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,824
You've got to get out of there. Cholo?

137
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,059
God damn it!

138
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,283
All right, Foxy, shop
till you drop, baby.

139
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,216
You know it, brother.

140
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,284
Yeah, 'cause getting
them stinking drunk...

141
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,421
is the only way you're gonna get laid.

142
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,000
When's the last time
you got laid? I forget.

143
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,594
Fox, I don't care about love.
All I care about is money.

144
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:53,729
That's all I want, baby.

145
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,566
Yes.

146
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:58,940
Foxy!

147
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,343
I can't get a shot. Cholo, hold on.

148
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,684
I got him. Cholo, I got him!

149
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,899
Bro, do me a favor, will you?

150
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,975
Next time, just let me
take the fucking shot.

151
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,171
Fucking cowboy. Stop being a pussy, man.

152
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,640
Yeah, I got what I need.

153
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,424
A little something extra, too.

154
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,460
Nice.

155
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,526
Here, kid, pick that up.

156
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,265
I'm bit. Yeah, you're bit.

157
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,603
Not gonna leave you here.
Gonna get you out of here, okay?

158
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,700
No. I will not become
one of those things.

159
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,802
Riley, step aside.

160
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,473
No, you put that thing away.
Riley, come on. Step aside.

161
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,676
I said put it away.

162
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,939
This is Riley. Cease
fire. Repeat, cease fire.

163
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,175
Let's pack it up. We're
going to call it a night.

164
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,583
Shit happens, right?

165
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,675
Only if you let it, Charlie.

166
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,290
Life goes on at Fiddler's Green...

167
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,421
in the heart of one of America's
oldest and greatest cities.

168
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,995
Bordered on three sides
by mighty rivers...

169
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,468
Fiddler's Green offers luxury
living in the grand old style.

170
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,700
Dine at one of six fine restaurants.

171
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,565
Look for that perfect gift in
our fully-stocked shopping mall.

172
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,871
Man, they sure did used
to make it sound nice.

173
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,672
Still sounds nice to me.

174
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,012
There is a difference between
our place and other places.

175
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,847
If you can appreciate
that difference...

176
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,750
You're not going to be around no more?

177
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,450
You little bitch, you can come up
and party with me any time you want.

178
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,294
I hate going under the river.

179
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,553
Cholo.

180
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,825
Shit. Let's get out of here, Foxy.

181
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,423
Yeah, man. Back off, Riley.

182
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,560
Just back the fuck off
'cause I am not in the mood.

183
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,196
You think that kid was in the
mood? Look, he knew the risk, man.

184
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,797
He took the job like we all
took the job knowing the risk.

185
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,900
Exactly, the job. You know
what the job is, Cholo?

186
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,968
It's to bring things
in that people need.

187
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,209
Not to make a few extra bucks
selling liquor on the street.

188
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,647
What, you're talking about this?

189
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,742
This is for me and my
new friends, to celebrate.

190
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,684
That's what that's for.

191
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,120
A kid died out there
on the street tonight...

192
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,317
so that you can fucking celebrate.

193
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,994
Riley, you know what you remind
me of? You remind me of my old man.

194
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,763
A nice guy. I loved him and
all that but he was a dumbass.

195
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,029
Never went for anything,
so he never had anything.

196
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,766
What do you got, Riley? Nothing.
I'm going to have my own place, man.

197
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,535
My own goddamn place.

198
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,534
You're dreaming, Cholo.
They won't let you in there.

199
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,842
They wouldn't let me in
there. We're the wrong kind.

200
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,575
Yeah, well, we'll see.

201
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,673
Isn't it time?

202
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,912
Isn't it your time? For Fiddler's Green?

203
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,695
DeMora, supplies unit.

204
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,304
What's in them boxes?
Essential supplies.

205
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,067
For Kaufman.

206
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,440
Mark your calendars.

207
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,110
Mr. Kaufman cordially invites...

208
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,178
residents of the Green
to a masked ball...

209
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,847
on the eve of Allhallows.

210
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,722
It is strictly forbidden
to come as you are.

211
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,658
It's expensive. Look at that.

212
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,717
You like it?

213
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,153
I could tell.

214
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,372
Can I ask you to stop, sir?

215
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,712
Quitting time, Deke.

216
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,309
You're going to need
this to get back in.

217
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,116
When I said quitting time,
I meant quitting time.

218
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,021
Hey, baby.

219
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,192
"The only way to the Father,
is through me," sayeth the Lord.

220
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,164
So, Riley, you want to go get a drink?

221
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,532
Just look at me. You can
tell I could use a drink.

222
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,264
You know, Charlie,
why don't you go ahead?

223
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,604
I'll catch up. Where are you going?

224
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,776
I got to see a man about a car.

225
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,544
A car?

226
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,193
All right. Here's the deal.

227
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:11,400
Rivers protect us on two sides.
Bridges are all blocked up.

228
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,604
The only overland access is
here, called the "Throat."

229
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,140
And these fences go all the way across?

230
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,176
Half a mile, both ways.

231
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,038
Stench. High noon. Shit.

232
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,547
They don't come around
here much anymore.

233
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,213
It's like they've
learned they can't get in.

234
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,683
Take his fucking face off.

235
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,426
How long are you going to
let Kaufman push you around?

236
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,029
You like shining his
shoes, pressing his pants?

237
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,507
He didn't build that
place. He just took it over.

238
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,875
Kept the best for himself, and
left us with a slum to live in.

239
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:58,074
But if there's enough of us,
if all of you would join up...

240
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,581
we could make this a
fit place to live in.

241
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,984
Dad, look who's here.

242
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,319
Riley Denbo! I used to work with him.

243
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,188
Bringing in toothpicks for the
bastards to pick at their gums.

244
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,129
And food and other stuff, for all of us.

245
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,026
Come in with us, Riley. Both of you.

246
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,565
Together we'd be unstoppable.

247
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,730
No one's unstoppable, Mulligan.

248
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,274
You're worried about being
locked out. Now, you see that?

249
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,503
I can't help but think
we're all locked in.

250
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,205
I'm looking for a world
where there's no fences.

251
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,515
Here. Antibiotics for your boy. Thanks.

252
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,254
You all right, Son? I'm fine, Dad.

253
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,505
Hey, easy, easy, Knipp! Easy.

254
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,905
Mr. DeMora. Mr. Kaufman
isn't home. And I heard...

255
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,339
that.

256
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,448
I called Security. They should be here.

257
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,007
Yeah, I got it.

258
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,862
Where are you?

259
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,580
Oh, shit.

260
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,400
Oh, God, he killed himself.

261
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,661
All right, lady, I need you to
down, okay? Try to keep it together.

262
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,671
Who are you? Are you
Security? No, I'm not Security.

263
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,764
Then, who the hell are you?

264
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,072
I work for Kaufman. All right, lady,
I just need you to calm down, please.

265
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,908
What are you doing with that?

266
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,608
Lady, you know what I
have to do. I'm sorry.

267
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,672
Dad!

268
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,680
He's gonna turn, lady.

269
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,186
No, he won't. Please.

270
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,983
No, he's okay. Please,
we don't have a choice.

271
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,149
Don't make this anymore
difficult than it has to be.

272
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,715
He's gonna turn, don't do this!

273
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,924
What's happening? Shut up.

274
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,704
Hey, kid.

275
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,286
What the hell's going on here?

276
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,436
It's your problem. Clean it up.

277
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,738
Hey, lady, it's okay.

278
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,187
What did you do to my car? What car?

279
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,126
The last car I drove out of
this town was three years ago.

280
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,099
No, I bought a car. It
was right there yesterday.

281
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,361
There were two guys working on it.

282
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,494
There was nobody here this morning.

283
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,870
Son of a bitch.

284
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,304
What happened, Riley?
Did you get fucked?

285
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,570
Come with me.

286
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,377
You got fucked.

287
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,045
¢Ü¢Ü

288
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,810
Roach. Hey, how's it going?

289
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,782
I've been better. Where's Chihuahua?

290
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,377
Around the back.

291
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,551
Come on!

292
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,719
Lot of action in here today.
We've got a new kind of game.

293
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,422
What are they betting on? Black and red.

294
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,829
Who wins the fight.

295
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,400
Stenches don't fight.

296
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,901
They do when there's food.

297
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,562
What's on the menu, cat or dog?

298
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,129
I told you, today it's something new.

299
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:53,174
Who do you want, black
or red? $60 on black.

300
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,869
What the fuck happened to my car?

301
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,471
They're fixing it up.

302
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,449
No, I went to the garage.
There's nothing there.

303
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,986
Your guys aren't there,
and my car is not there.

304
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:40,150
This is not me. I do not do
this to you. I'm your friend.

305
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,318
Well, be my friend and
get my fucking car back...

306
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,522
or I'll have to carry you out
of here inside that fucking hat.

307
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,406
This guy could be
trouble. Keep him busy.

308
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,902
Give a drink.

309
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,044
Let me have my gun.

310
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,758
Supply run last night, huh?

311
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,795
I heard you got some
money. Not interested.

312
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,887
I'll show you how to turn
that money into more...

313
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,158
I said I'm not interested.

314
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,647
Jesus! Fuck!

315
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,743
My suit.

316
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,777
He ruined my fucking suit!

317
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,381
Shit.

318
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,887
I'm all right.

319
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,136
Thank you. Thank you.

320
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,501
I've seen you around.

321
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,639
I've seen you around,
too, working the streets.

322
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,309
You were checking me out?

323
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,818
What the hell happened here?

324
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,883
Someone shot the little
fat man. I see that.

325
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,253
You're under arrest.

326
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,426
Hey.

327
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,563
What? Why you?

328
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,440
Why'd the little fat man throw
you in there with them things?

329
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,107
Wasn't the little man.

330
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,339
It was the big man.

331
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,982
Mr. K.

332
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,081
He's got his fingers in everything here.

333
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,748
If you can drink it, shoot it up...

334
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:05,658
fuck it, gamble on
it, it belongs to him.

335
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,690
Didn't answer the question.

336
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,134
He asked you why. I
know what he asked me.

337
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,106
They found out I was helping
out Mulligan and his people...

338
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,611
tired of eating bones
while he's having a steak.

339
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,514
Me, too, but every place is the same.

340
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,615
Places with people.

341
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,352
I'm going to find a place
where there's no people.

342
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,412
North.

343
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,285
Canada. If you get a way out...

344
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:41,191
I'm coming with you. No,
Riley likes to be alone.

345
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,392
He might take me, 'cause he says...

346
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,063
having me around is pretty
much the same as being alone.

347
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,500
And 'cause I can make myself
useful, and I can shoot.

348
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,070
I can shoot. I can be
pretty fucking useful.

349
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,519
I had training. I was going to
join the army, help the Green...

350
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,985
till somebody figured I'd be
a better hooker than a soldier.

351
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,150
You know, I don't want to
hear your fucking story.

352
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:12,060
Everyone's got a story, and
I am sick of hearing them.

353
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,889
What's your story, Riley?

354
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,162
I don't have one.

355
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:21,103
Nothing bad ever happened to
me till everything changed.

356
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,603
Everything changed for all of us.

357
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,781
Hey, Mulligan.

358
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,856
What they going to do?
Kill him? Not right away.

359
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:48,895
First they'll try to get him
to talk. About people like me.

360
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,783
Mr. DeMora. Boss.

361
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,286
How was Uniontown? Dead.

362
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,783
Death intrudes on us even
here in the city, I'm afraid.

363
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,155
I heard abut what
happened with my neighbors.

364
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,629
And I'm grateful for your help.

365
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,222
That's what I'm here for, boss...

366
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,268
to take care of any problems you got.

367
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,771
Look, I got you a little present,
a little souvenir from town.

368
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,437
I know you're used to
better vintage than this...

369
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,776
but it's the best we got.

370
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,113
Little champers to take
the edge off things.

371
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,953
There we go.

372
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,392
This is very extravagant.
Yeah, well, I can afford it.

373
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,825
With the $20,000 you
owe me from last night...

374
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,958
and the money from all the
other nights together...

375
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,969
I got enough for my own place.

376
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,271
You mean here in the
Green? Sure, why not?

377
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,910
I'm sorry, Mr. DeMora...

378
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,045
but there's a very long waiting list.

379
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,447
How long? Well...

380
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,719
this is an extremely desirable location.

381
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,984
Space is very limited.

382
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,691
You mean restricted, don't you?

383
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,386
I do have a board of directors...

384
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,656
and I have a membership committee.

385
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:38,996
They have to approve.
Don't do this to me. Don't.

386
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,802
How long have I been
working for you? Three years?

387
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,672
Taking out your garbage,
cleaning up after you...

388
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,343
and then you're going to
say I'm not good enough?

389
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,108
Let me tell you something,
you're going to let me in...

390
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,843
because I know what goes on around here.

391
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,145
Do your committee members know...

392
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,152
what the fuck is going
out with the garbage?

393
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,587
So, you're gonna let me in, you hear me?

394
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,289
Maybe we could talk about this
when you're a little less excited.

395
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,372
I won't be needing this man anymore.

396
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,130
Take that, you scary zombie.

397
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,808
...come back to God.

398
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,606
Give up your lives of sin.

399
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,242
Praise the Lord! Father is the only way.

400
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,884
Come back to Jesus.

401
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,950
Fox, get the guys. We're going out.

402
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,321
Want me to call Riley? Forget
Riley. Just us. Come on.

403
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,324
Thanks.

404
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,364
Shit, man. You win. You
got him right in the brain.

405
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,963
That's right. Double or nothing.

406
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,507
Brubaker, who'd you blow
to get this cushy job?

407
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,878
Cholo, you bum, how's it going?

408
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,041
Where's Riley? He's retired.

409
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,245
We're taking the truck out.

410
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:41,014
That's from yesterday.
What? You're shitting me.

411
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,026
I'm gonna quit drinking, man.

412
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,858
What the hell is that? Relax.
It's just target practice.

413
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,026
Barrett, stop scratching
around back there.

414
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,399
You're going to fuck up my shot.

415
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,700
I'm not doing nothing,
man, I'm just standing here.

416
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,382
There's nothing there, man.

417
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,994
So, what the hell is
that, screaming practice?

418
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,688
Stenches! They're all over the place.

419
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,326
Let's make our move. Come on.

420
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,335
All right, go.

421
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,373
Their eyes.

422
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,216
Mouse, take that.

423
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,084
Cholo, should we send
up some sky flowers?

424
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,182
It ain't our fight, Fox.

425
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,386
The stenches want to get
in, let them in. Come on.

426
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,297
Everybody, get busy.

427
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,839
That's our way out. Should
we do something about this?

428
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,036
That's our way out, get us there.

429
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,513
No.

430
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,048
Get out of here!

431
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,091
No!

432
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,455
Kaufman.

433
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,087
The one that got away.

434
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,625
That's right.

435
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,994
Remember you said we should
talk when I was less excited?

436
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,791
I'm a lot less excited right now.

437
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,491
What do you want, Mr. DeMora?

438
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,758
You might have noticed that
I had to leave in a hurry...

439
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,771
so I didn't get a chance to
take my money out of your bank.

440
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,966
I'd like you to handle
that withdrawal for me.

441
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,976
With interest: $5 million.

442
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,504
Or I'm gonna blow you out
of your fucking castle.

443
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,173
Because I got Dead Reckoning.

444
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,375
That's unfortunate.

445
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,886
Well, unfortunate for you, perhaps.

446
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,122
I want you to put
that money on a boat...

447
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,421
and send it across the river to
the South Side, 10th Street Pier.

448
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,461
One man to drive the boat, no more.

449
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,888
You have till midnight,
that's two and a half hours.

450
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,194
I won't be there, and Dead
Reckoning won't be there.

451
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,394
But I'll know if it happens, and
I'll know if it doesn't happen.

452
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,562
Copy?

453
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,269
Trouble?

454
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,638
In a world where the dead
are returning to life...

455
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,748
the world "trouble"
loses much of its meaning.

456
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,910
He wants money. Pay him.

457
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,519
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

458
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,355
We have other options.

459
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,423
Denbo. Give me Denbo.

460
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,461
Get up. You're coming with me.

461
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,436
Where you taking him? Don't worry.

462
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,530
Where are you taking him?

463
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,415
You take care of him? Hell, yeah.

464
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,578
He pulled me out of the fire.

465
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,920
It was bad.

466
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,855
Just look at me, you
can tell it was bad.

467
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,695
Mr. Denbo, can I offer you a drink?

468
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,640
I don't drink. Why am I here?

469
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,304
We want you to repossess a
vehicle that belongs to us...

470
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,780
a vehicle that you designed, Mr. Denbo.

471
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,875
Dead Reckoning has been stolen
by your second-in-command...

472
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,977
who I want captured or killed...

473
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,353
and I want my $2 million
piece of equipment returned.

474
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,686
My truck.

475
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,625
My truck, which has guns.

476
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,386
Powerful guns.

477
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,031
It'll do a great deal of damage...

478
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,226
if they're aimed at this city.

479
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,236
Why don't you just send out your troops?

480
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,363
I can send 50 men against that thing...

481
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:59,068
and they'd come back in body
bags. Now, Cholo was your man.

482
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,737
Maybe you can get close enough
to do what has to be done.

483
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,305
It's a good thing I'm still in town.

484
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,314
See, I bought a car.

485
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,078
I was going to drive out
of here, but it disappeared.

486
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,147
I guess someone didn't want me to leave.

487
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,249
You're a very popular man.

488
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,495
How much are your
services going to cost me?

489
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:27,128
A vehicle, enough weapons
and ammunition to go north.

490
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,563
But there's nothing up
north. That's the idea.

491
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,876
There's one more thing: My
friends, they go with me.

492
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,275
Take them.

493
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:41,176
Can you find Dead Reckoning, quickly?

494
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,048
How quickly? Midnight.

495
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,555
I have a way.

496
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,919
Mouse, there are three
things a man must do alone:

497
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,897
Be born, die, and we all
know the other one, don't we?

498
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,490
Yeah, okay, Cholo. Just don't
leave me here alone too long...

499
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,298
Two hours max. Give me a call.
Let me know if we're rich or not.

500
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,497
All right, two hours.

501
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,164
Give him something for the nerves.

502
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,231
Something for the nerves.

503
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,911
Stay real. Okay.

504
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,796
¢Ü¢Ü

505
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,940
Can't believe you guys are turning
me into a fucking boy scout.

506
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,809
Not a boy.

507
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,343
You don't have to come
out if you don't want to.

508
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,076
I didn't say that.

509
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:58,183
Some shit, though, going
out to save Kaufman's ass.

510
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,855
I'm not doing this for Kaufman.

511
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,220
This is for the people in the city.

512
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,954
What do you think's going to happen
to them if Cholo shells the Green?

513
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,019
Okay. I'm with you.

514
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,760
No, I like the ones I already got.

515
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,325
This piece fires 14 rounds a second.

516
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,536
I don't normally need that many.

517
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,107
I don't normally talk to retards.

518
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,974
Pretty easy to make
fun of some people, huh?

519
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,882
I could make a whole
lot of fun out of you.

520
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,883
I'll take this one.

521
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,882
He thinks he's taking care of you.

522
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:36,983
He does.

523
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,755
Without his guns, I'd be dead by now.

524
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,161
Without you, he'd be dead by now.

525
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,623
Fair trade.

526
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,964
Riley, these guys are coming.

527
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,398
Gentlemen and lady.

528
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,202
Mr. Kaufman thought you
could use some support.

529
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,870
Don't need any. Nevertheless. Manolete.

530
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:58,105
Manolete, named after the bullfighter.

531
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,942
Monica. You can call me Motown.

532
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,584
Pillsbury.

533
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,525
I'm here to do something.
Why are we standing around?

534
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,820
Let's do something.

535
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,859
We taking the jeep?

536
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,801
The Woody. It's bigger, has guns.

537
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:30,145
Jeez. Cholo made a mess.
No. Cholo didn't do all this.

538
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,272
This is stenches. A lot of them.

539
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,511
Maybe still here.

540
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,822
That's where they came in. Look.

541
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,449
That's where they went out.

542
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,018
Trying to get to the city.
I'm going to go get the ammo.

543
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,223
Crank up the Woody, Charlie.

544
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,433
Make sure she doesn't hurt herself.

545
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,092
I can take care of myself, okay?

546
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,400
Fine. Charlie, make sure
she doesn't hurt anyone else.

547
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,133
You, come with me.

548
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,972
Walkers, Mr. Denbo?

549
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,775
And moving toward the city.

550
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,646
They'll never get across the
river. I wouldn't be so sure.

551
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,847
They learned how to work together.

552
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,820
They're mindless walking corpses...

553
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,083
and many of us will be, too...

554
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,784
if you don't stay focused
on the task at hand.

555
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,122
Zombies, man. They creep me out.

556
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,691
Do you really think they
can get across the water?

557
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,030
If you asked me that a week
ago, I would have said no.

558
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,467
But now...

559
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,371
One way or the other, we got to
get our hands on Dead Reckoning.

560
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,670
There's more of them out there.

561
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,708
I can hear them.
They're always out there.

562
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,711
You're all right? Yeah, no problem.

563
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,620
Woody's in there.

564
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:11,305
Who's got the keys, guys?
No keys to get. Melted.

565
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,151
Screw the keys. Let's just
hot-wire the fucking thing.

566
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,988
Yellow to red.

567
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:28,225
What the fuck does a Samoan know
about hot-wiring a fucking car?

568
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,358
Fifty thousand cars
stolen in Samoa every year.

569
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,868
Yeah? Well, a million in Detroit.

570
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,167
Detroit's got 50 million cars.

571
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,039
Samoa: 50,000. Every one stolen.

572
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,973
Charlie.

573
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,050
Why do you lick your
rifle? It catches the light.

574
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,549
What light? How can you see anything?

575
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,022
Good eye.

576
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:01,955
Hey.

577
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,194
Charlie?

578
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:06,728
Shit!

579
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,900
Off-center, but I got him.

580
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:16,940
Awesome, man.

581
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,379
Got a flashlight? Yeah.

582
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,893
Brubaker?

583
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,200
Hey, Brubaker?

584
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,477
Brubaker, you there?

585
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,374
Hear that? Yeah.

586
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,030
All right, keep that thing
shining. Let's get ammo.

587
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,768
There's.50 caliber
around here somewhere.

588
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,639
Great. Here's the.50.

589
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,523
Jesus Christ.

590
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:48,304
No, not in here. Think
about where we are.

591
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,562
Take a breath.

592
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,003
Choose your shots.

593
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,202
We're even. Not.

594
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,572
That hurt. I didn't hurt you.

595
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,216
I got it.

596
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,825
Oh, God.

597
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,304
Is he bit? Yeah.

598
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,404
Go!

599
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,207
How long does he have?

600
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,943
Had a little brother bit. He took
less than an hour before he turned.

601
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,817
And then what happened?

602
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,485
I shot him.

603
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,952
You said nothing bad
ever happened to you.

604
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,153
That happened to my brother.

605
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,364
Yeah. Dead is dead.

606
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:03,128
And that ain't you or me.

607
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,437
I'm sorry. No! No!

608
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,958
I recognize that some
of you are concerned...

609
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,027
and I wanna assure you...

610
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,908
that if anything goes wrong,
measures have been taken.

611
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:42,440
I've established outposts
with food and supplies...

612
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,810
that will support us on our way.

613
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:48,178
On our way to where?
Anywhere that we want to go.

614
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,845
Alternative sites have been
chosen for us and our families...

615
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,946
as well as necessary support personnel.

616
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,514
What about all the others?

617
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,457
All the others can
be replaced by others.

618
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,722
Boss. You're interrupting me, Bill.

619
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,324
It's bad timing.

620
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,992
Just when I was talking about
how people can be replaced.

621
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,696
A day may come when you earn
yourself some responsibilities.

622
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,002
But right now the
responsibilities are mine.

623
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,701
They're all mine.

624
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,467
It was my ingenuity
that took an old world...

625
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,410
and made it into something new.

626
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,971
I put up the fences to make it safe.

627
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:23,279
I hired the soldiers and
paid for their training.

628
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:28,017
I kept the people off the streets
by giving them games and vices...

629
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,221
which cost me money.

630
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,659
But I spend it because
the responsibility is mine.

631
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:36,529
Now, do you understand the
meaning of the word responsibility?

632
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,431
We have to do what we have to do.

633
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,134
Foxy, I know I'm never gonna be great.

634
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,336
I'm never gonna be on the
list of names of people...

635
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:51,039
who done great things
because I don't do anything.

636
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,604
Not one thing.

637
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,416
If it wasn't for this truck,
I wouldn't be any different...

638
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,283
than that poor Mexican
bastard out there.

639
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,789
Cholo, look, Kaufman might not pay.

640
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,886
Kaufman's gonna pay, man.

641
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:06,417
But if he doesn't, he knows
I'm gonna do a jihad on his ass.

642
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,279
When you hit Route 6, take a right.

643
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,651
How do you know which way to go?

644
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,317
Homing device. Cool.

645
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,730
How long since you been out here?

646
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,567
I've never been out.

647
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:55,070
I've lived in the city
since it was a real city.

648
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,112
Pull over.

649
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,815
Cover them, Charlie.

650
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,815
All right, you're working for
Kaufman, I'm working for Kaufman.

651
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,325
My job is to stop Cholo.

652
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:14,887
Your job is to bring the truck
back, with or without me, right?

653
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,762
Not without you, no.
Well, that means yes.

654
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,096
Here's what's going to happen.

655
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:22,195
I'm going to do my job. You're
not going to get to do yours.

656
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,934
Kaufman is never going to
see Dead Reckoning again.

657
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,068
And when I get it, I'm
gonna do what I want with it.

658
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:31,944
Anyone has any problems with
that, you can get out right here.

659
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,343
Some choice. No choice. Close door.

660
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,452
Keep them covered, Charlie. Wait.

661
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,252
You made us come all the way out here...

662
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:44,156
just to steal a fucking truck?

663
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,785
You made a deal, Riley.

664
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,126
You're going back on a deal.
You never done that before.

665
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,428
If Cholo shells the
Green, all deals are off.

666
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,896
If something worse happens,
I don't know about you...

667
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,768
but I don't want to be out
here in a car without a roof.

668
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,918
Mouse, you got anything?

669
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,415
No boat, no money, no nothing.

670
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,191
Load the six-packs.

671
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,858
¢Ü¢Ü

672
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,805
Six-pack loaded.

673
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,112
All right, load the other six.

674
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,253
We're not gonna show
them any goddamn mercy.

675
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,123
I know where Cholo's going. Where?

676
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,597
Mount Washington, overlooks the city.

677
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:37,860
We can beat him there.

678
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,902
In that truck, he's
gotta take the main roads.

679
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,130
We can take the back streets. Right.

680
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,571
Make a right on lvy, then
take a left on Westminster.

681
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,973
You wanna go up the hill?
Yes, I'm wanna go up the hill.

682
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,840
Let's go up the hill.

683
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,813
Almost midnight, sir.

684
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,513
Pack us up. We might be leaving.

685
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:06,612
In the boat?

686
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,316
I'd rather be taking Dead Reckoning...

687
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,052
but not available.

688
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,103
From this hillside,
they can shell the Green.

689
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,237
They're gonna be coming up this road.

690
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,339
Pull in around the corner.

691
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,355
All right, they're coming.

692
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,396
You guys stay here and keep real quiet.

693
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,523
I'm going to try and talk my way inside.

694
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,759
He's going to steal that
truck and leave us here.

695
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,326
Riley would never do that.

696
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,497
Just look at him, you can
tell he'd never do that.

697
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,167
I like that man. You, go help him.

698
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,166
Go.

699
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,022
Everything's okay back there.

700
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,924
It's too late to send me back.

701
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,494
Now, put that thing away.

702
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,764
Put on your best Sunday smile,
and just try to look friendly.

703
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,327
I am friendly.

704
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,770
Hey, Cholo. Take a look at this.

705
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,834
It's Denbo and his idiot.

706
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,537
All right. Stop the truck.

707
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,373
Come on, here.

708
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,857
So, how did you get
up here? In the Woody.

709
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,222
I tracked you with this.

710
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,317
Forgot to tell you...

711
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,487
the truck's got a little
transmitter in her belly.

712
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,224
You were always a smart guy.

713
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,095
Always a lot smarter than me, man.

714
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,429
That's not saying much.

715
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,369
Open up. What, are you fucking nuts?

716
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,666
Open up.

717
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,019
Hey, Charlie.

718
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,482
So, who's the smart one now?

719
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,787
Thought you would have quit...

720
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,488
but here you are still working
for the man, aren't you, Riley?

721
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,497
What? Kaufman sent you
up to take care of me?

722
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,657
Yeah.

723
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,961
Takes a true friend to stab you
right in the front, doesn't it?

724
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,533
That man pulls the trigger, he's dead.

725
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,508
Who else is out there?

726
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,411
Kaufman sent some guys with
us. We took care of them.

727
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,452
Cover him.

728
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,419
Pretty Boy, lock in the target.

729
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,806
We're running out of time.

730
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,698
I got you now.

731
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,010
You hit that tower square on...

732
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,909
you're gonna kill a
lot of innocent people.

733
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:01,245
You miss, you hit the city, you're
gonna kill a lot of our friends.

734
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,841
Want to know who killed our friends?

735
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,011
Kaufman is the one
that's killed our friends.

736
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,954
Every time I took out his garbage,
I took out one of our friends...

737
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,651
people he wanted off the streets.

738
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:12,057
He turned me into a goon, then
he's gonna piss all over me?

739
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,152
I don't think so.

740
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,335
What are you gonna
get out of this, Cholo?

741
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,701
Hopefully my money.

742
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,972
Money burns. Yeah,
not if it's in a vault.

743
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,376
All right, Mr. K., won't
be needing you anymore.

744
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,860
You set this right? Yes.

745
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,921
Riley, you did something to it
with your fucking little toy.

746
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,593
This? What the fuck did you do? Fix it.

747
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,568
Fix it. Not a fucking chance.

748
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,479
Cholo, look out.

749
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:30,797
Fuck.

750
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,104
You know, Riley...

751
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,615
there's something about you
that I've always really hated.

752
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:43,743
You're still here, aren't
you? What do you care?

753
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,310
You got what you wanted. You're hit.

754
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:47,886
How you doing in there, Charlie?

755
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,686
I'm being friendly.

756
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,454
What's in the bags? Money.

757
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,265
Whose money?

758
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,360
Watch out. Get down. Quick.

759
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:05,031
Ours.

760
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,005
Yes? We got Cholo.

761
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,178
Kaufman. I'm here.

762
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,585
I just did something...

763
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,986
I might not have done otherwise.

764
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,056
You lied to me, Denbo.

765
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,625
You didn't get DeMora.
He's shooting at us.

766
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,495
That's not Cholo, Mr. Kaufman.

767
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,108
Holy shit. They got across the river.

768
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,304
Look at that.

769
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,971
I didn't even have to blow the place up.

770
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,514
The fucking stenches did it for me.

771
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,625
We're going back to the city to
see if we can help. Pick him up.

772
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,319
Where we going, man? What are we doing?

773
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,488
Easy, Gargantua, come
on. Get him inside. Quick.

774
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,860
Not this horse. Not this horse.

775
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,633
Take that Woody if you still got it.

776
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,499
Fine. You got me, too.

777
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,565
Thanks.

778
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,639
Anyone else?

779
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:16,971
Where you gonna go, Cholo?

780
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,946
There's always that
outpost in Cleveland.

781
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:21,175
Haven't heard from them in a while.

782
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,683
Take my chances.

783
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,215
You have no right.

784
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:29,883
No right.

785
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,693
Woody's around the corner.
Guns and ammo inside.

786
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:34,956
Thanks.

787
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,465
Get us back on the main road.

788
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,302
You have blood, here.
We almost lost you there.

789
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,437
You all right? Yeah.

790
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,807
You want to be really
helpful, roll me one.

791
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:51,402
Yeah, all right.

792
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,317
What was built to keep people
safe is gonna trap them inside.

793
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,818
This is Denbo in the Reckoning.

794
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:40,828
Open up those fences
and let the people out.

795
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,160
The fences are still hot. We
can't cut the juice from here.

796
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,893
We've been trying to
call the power station.

797
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,195
There's no one left over there.

798
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:47,735
We got to get the fuck out of here.

799
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,167
There's no one left here, either.

800
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,466
Move it.

801
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,975
We can rocket those fences.

802
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,410
Got to get across river.

803
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,811
The bridges into the city,
they're all bricked up.

804
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:01,611
Let's just fucking
blast our way through.

805
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:02,742
No, we can't do that.

806
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,651
There's a war going on over there.
We cross any of these bridges...

807
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,552
we're gonna end up right
in the middle of it.

808
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:09,557
We have to come in
outside of the Throat.

809
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,128
Somehow, Fox, I thought
we'd be traveling...

810
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,255
in a lot better style than this, baby.

811
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,391
At least we're still
fucking traveling, brother.

812
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:20,660
What?

813
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:36,783
Come on, Fox, let's get
the hell out of here.

814
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:56,429
What?

815
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,740
Can you fucking believe it?

816
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,176
Nothing works out the
way you want it to.

817
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:07,738
There's something always comes
around the corner and just gets you.

818
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,453
It's your choice, bro.

819
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:20,720
I always wanted to see
how the other half lives.

820
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,796
The old J&L can take us over.

821
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,359
It's a drawbridge. They leave it up.

822
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,428
That means it's not guarded.
Can you get us there?

823
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,530
Yeah. Let's go.

824
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:58,516
I can stay with you, if you want.

825
01:15:58,587 --> 01:15:59,781
No. No.

826
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:02,318
This is between me and the man.

827
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,024
Fox, she's all yours.

828
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:11,031
Hope you do better than
you did with me, man.

829
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,692
Yeah.

830
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:51,365
Holy shit!

831
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,101
A disturbance has been reported...

832
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,438
on the outskirts of the city.

833
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,000
There's no reason to believe...

834
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,343
that Fiddler's Green
could ever be compromised.

835
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:03,680
But we suggest that residents report
any sightings of unusual behavior.

836
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:12,386
There it is. Let's hope it's
still wired into the grid.

837
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,353
Shut the hatch, just in case.

838
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:21,521
When I get the bridge
down, you come pick me up.

839
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,801
How do you work this thing?
It's just like a video game.

840
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,507
What the fuck are you doing?

841
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:42,412
Making myself useful.

842
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,527
Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop!

843
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:23,919
Stenches.

844
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:26,858
Starboard.

845
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,999
They're behind us, too.

846
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,904
I can't get a shot.

847
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,399
Now shoot!

848
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,525
They'll never get in
here. Neither will Riley.

849
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,398
Unlock the roof hatch, Pretty Boy.

850
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,069
Oh, shit.

851
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,900
Riley, go for the roof. Okay.

852
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:04,250
Roll!

853
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,663
What are you doing? Forward!

854
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:10,993
I'm gonna shake these bastards.

855
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,514
Get out of the way.

856
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:04,278
Hello?

857
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:05,746
Hello?

858
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,158
What is it? Is something going on?

859
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,716
Stenches!

860
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,133
We're fucked.

861
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,165
Angle the mortars for the Throat...

862
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,074
and send up some sky flowers.

863
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:31,874
Got her!

864
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,787
Oh, thank God.

865
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,304
Watch it now.

866
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,604
Oh, my God.

867
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:35,905
Downstairs. The car.

868
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:44,014
You bastards! You have no right!

869
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,021
Mr. Kaufman, come on, let's go.

870
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,896
Mr. Kaufman wants you to know...

871
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,562
All right, we're going to the boat.

872
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,663
...he has dedicated
himself to your well-being.

873
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,298
Be careful when you open that door.

874
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:10,469
Should I call the crew,
sir? No, I'll call them.

875
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,062
God damn it.

876
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:36,993
What the fuck?

877
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:52,410
Goodbye, Mr. K.

878
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,547
Come back here, you son of a
bitch. You got the fucking keys.

879
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,373
Fucking spic bastard.

880
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,497
Nah. You're dead.

881
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,709
Oh, my God. You are dead.

882
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:04,541
Number 1's clear. Going for Number 2.

883
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,239
I don't normally need that many.

884
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,373
Don't bother. Come on down.

885
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:13,147
Blow the fences.

886
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:47,683
Sky flowers don't work no more.

887
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:50,851
Shoot.

888
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:53,755
But there's people.

889
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,926
Those people are all
dead. Shoot, Charlie.

890
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,982
We're too late.

891
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,051
No.

892
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:29,488
Look.

893
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:49,072
You saved them.

894
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,900
You staying or leaving?

895
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:09,861
You? Leaving.

896
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,368
Unless you need my help. No.

897
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:14,035
Why don't you stick around?

898
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:16,838
We could turn this place into
what we always wanted it to be.

899
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,071
Maybe.

900
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:22,276
Then what will we turn
into? We'll see, won't we?

901
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:30,613
You want to go to Canada now, Riley?

902
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:33,088
Sure, if no one has any objections.

903
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:35,254
No, we'll take you with us.

904
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:37,792
I'll try to make myself useful.

905
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:41,358
Anchor, load the guns.
We're hitting the road.

906
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:56,739
Now we can go.

907
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:34,345
No.

908
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:37,283
They're just looking for a place to go.

909
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,925
Same as us.

910
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:46,798
Fire off what's left inside those tubes.

911
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:49,166
We're not gonna need it anymore.

912
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,237
Take us north.
