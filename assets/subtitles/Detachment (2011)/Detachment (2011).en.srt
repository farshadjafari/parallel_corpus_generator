00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:44,811

"For Henry"

13
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:47,943
I wasn't good in school

14
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:49,749
I didn't care for school

15
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,580
Um ... It was an nice socially

16
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,100
Based on my own experience

17
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,413
But I can't just went along ...

18
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,832
I started over in Music Major

19
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,519
I'll be Rock-n-road Star

20
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:02,517
But that didn't quite worked out.

21
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:03,992
In 1985

22
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,711
The journey of hurricane during the Gloria

23
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:11,057
I was taking an train into the city to work

24
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:15,397
I was ... I gone to work and I was on
the phone with my brother-in-law

25
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:18,445
who ... he had just started teaching

26
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:20,782
He said that he was off from school

27
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,200
Now, wait a second,

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,057
You off from school for hurricane,
I am going to the city ....

29
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,014
To work in the Office building?

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,105
Its an pretty good game, right.

31
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:32,568
My mother was an teacher

32
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:35,632
I knew it without an shadow of a doubt

33
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:37,078
From my early childhood

34
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:40,015
By the one job, I would never
do as become an teacher

35
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:44,283
Ever never I would take the
top-cards on a "turn plate"

36
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,213
I'll be seperated anything

37
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:49,540
Rather than become an teacher

38
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:52,840
And I decided to be a teacher because I
wanted to do something with my life besides

39
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,205
what I was doing which I was driving a truck

40
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,542
For a company and,

41
00:02:57,542 --> 00:03:01,763
And decided that I want to the better for myself,
so I started teaching a little bit, at the acting school

42
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:03,679
I was at age of 37

43
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,572
A friend of mine from the College

44
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,531
His aunt was the ...

45
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,904
Principle of the "all-girls" in
the city school in New York

46
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:12,398
In New Jersey

47
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:14,388
They were desperate for teachers

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,091
So I thought "Great",  I can do this for a year

49
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,174
It will keep my father for
making me an job for prudential.

50
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,836
And I figured it out what I wanted to do

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,804
Well they called up for enter an interview

52
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,104
And I have to get an job, and

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,156
In a Junior High school in Queens

54
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:36,737
And I ended up ...

55
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,208
I started it - my... what
was now reached 30 years

56
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,447
Most of the teachers here at one point

57
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,010
They believe

58
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:55,859
They could make the difference

59
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,979
I know how important it is

60
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:01,804
After guidance and to have ...

61
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:10,650
Someone help you to understand
the complexities of the

62
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,281
world that we living, they didn't really

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,173
have that ... growing up

64
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:52,711
I am money

65
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:59,308
I change hands like a dollar bill
its been robbed by the lab

66
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:03,040
I am geneis premium and cry for love

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,811
with volume

68
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,064
But the tears were offer myself

69
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:10,590
And that's all went wrong

70
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:40,634
* Phone ringing *

71
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:42,813
* Beep *

72
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,628

75
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,291

76
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,421
Get to the point, Dr. Harward
I have to school today, alright.

77
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:00,059
Day school gone down at the
state for last three years

78
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,899
Don't pretend you know the game,

79
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,424
You "ink-mark" my school and the chance
be done the worst kids in the region

80
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,631
Children deserve an education
Don't you agree?

81
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:10,354
I agree, you joking of it
and wasting my time

82
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:11,219
Get to the point, Dr. Harward ...

83
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:13,187
We need an concense builders

84
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,708
A new methodology

85
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,022
You corruptize the system

86
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,903
No, we're cleaning house

87
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,824
Supervisor-attendence feel
that its time your step down.

88
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:27,126
Babe, you got some fucking nerve come
to my yard with the heart your fucking self.

89
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:29,798
Carol, it was a time you were an educator

90
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:32,903
You were well respected.

91
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,499
Why don't you go out and talk?

92
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:54,679
Everybody to sit down and shut up,
alright stop pulling out the referrals

93
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,263
Sit

94
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:58,791
Sit down.

95
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:01,516
I am starting the DVD

96
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,326
I am starting the DVD

97
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,950
- Barth or Barthes
- Barth

98
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,115
- Mr. Barth
- Yes madam

99
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:33,574
Mr. Barth Henry

100
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,989
So you've been taking an
long term assignments at the ...

101
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,268
"Mark & Arthur"

102
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:40,618
The French

103
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,049
Ah thats what it worked out.

104
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,752
This an month-long assignment

105
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,498
Until I can fill it permanently

106
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,283
I was asked to meet with you because you come the
highly recommended the best suburb of the hall city.

107
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,295
This is someone who to be the hall-man.

108
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,900
I agree, Mr. Barth

109
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,515
You'll find many of your students
functionally well below the grade level

110
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,057
That is your task is trying to
get them not bother others

111
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,090
Teach curriculum

112
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,363

113
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:11,154

Listen up,  I have one rule

119
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:37,213
Just one.

120
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:39,765
If you don't want to be here

121
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,448
Don't come

122
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,334

00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,391
Its not dude, its Mr. Barth

124
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:48,014
The letter S for silent

126
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,335

Hey Marcus

129
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,879
Guess what

130
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:02,097
What?

131
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:03,254
You are free to leave

132
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:05,151

00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,846

134
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,309
- What's the fuck, you want me to go to the Dean's Office?
- I don't care where you go.

135
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:14,857
Everyone pull it out of your shit paper

136
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,524
I would like to assess each of you
individual writing skills you have ...

137
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,984
What do you think if I got no paper?

138
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,410
Okay here is the situation

139
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,709
You dead.

140
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:25,859
- Alright, write an brief but detailed essay about ...
- Hey jerk, ...

141
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,004
- I have a fucking question

142
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,050
... about what a friend or your parents

143
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,513
May say about you during your funeral

144
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,685
- Okay, you have 30 minutes
- Bullshit ...

145
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,371
(class laughing...)

146
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:41,132
I asked your motherfucking question, didn't I?

147
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:51,436
Anything else?

148
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,676
You had better fucking up before
I am fucking up your rat shit

149
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:00,013
That bag ...

150
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,949
It doesn't have any feelings ...

151
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,621
Its empty

152
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,678
I don't have any feeling
that you can hurt either

153
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:09,678
Okay? I understand you're angry

154
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:13,323
I used to be very angry too, okay.

155
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:16,829
I get it. You have no reason to
be angry with me, because ...

156
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:20,465
I am only the few people that to see
trying to give you an opportunity.

157
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,268
Now I am going to ask you

158
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,361
you just sit down

159
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,130
And do your best

160
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,372
And I will give you a piece of paper

161
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:28,578
How's that?

162
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,094
Can I get a fucking pen too?

163
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,593
Kids don't have any attention spend

164
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:42,499
They're bored

165
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:49,502
So how you supposed to view the man with
class attitude they don't ... if they don't believe ...

166
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,844
that you

167
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,524
Have something meaningful for share

168
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:02,815
Thank you

169
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:10,138
Why you fell Marcus out of
the class but not Jerry?

170
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:12,502
Well I got to make an example for someday

171
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:17,464
you know Marcus has been expelled from this unit,
and this would not be allowed in my classroom

172
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:19,657
What they were saying to me is just "material"

173
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,520
What's your name?

174
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:24,636
Meredith

175
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,630
Nice to meet you, Meredith

176
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,004
So you don't really care
what the kid say to you?

177
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:32,734
Perhaps I used to it

178
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,065
I wish to be that strong

179
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:36,757
It doesn't take that strength, Meredith

180
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:42,185
You must understand that unfortunetly most
of people are act on their self-awareness

181
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:46,868
You should keep that in mind and you will
have that chance at your second period

182
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:49,353
You will meet them again at every age

183
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,155
I want to see the Principle!

184
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,687
That's her, mom

185
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:59,416
You're bitch who expelled my baby?
and for what?

186
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,074
- Excuse me, maybe you would like to ...
- Because you can't handle it? ...

187
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:06,241
Bitch why don't you be here?  You want to be at home
everyday like that??!  I don't have time for this bullshit!

188
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:09,064
- Keep your voice down!
- Why don't you be here?

189
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:10,796
Hey Madam, clam down

190
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:12,668
We will talk about this in the Dead's Office

191
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:13,847
I wouldn't go anywhere with you

192
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,862
Look, I know you're angry, but

193
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:17,793
But they won't listen to you,
you need to talk with me.

194
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,492
- Races come on, I will sue your ass ...
- Come on, ladies ...

195
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:22,843
This way

196
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,245

197
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:29,974

199
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:47,653
Are you new here?

200
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:49,418
Yes, first day

201
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,058
Welcome

202
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,553
That was quite a scene back there.

203
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:54,979
I was a little shocked

204
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:56,709
But its actually safe here

205
00:12:58,261 --> 00:12:59,551

Whenever on my mind, I

I am truthful to myself

209
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,599
I am young

210
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,764
I am old and I am bored up to my soul

211
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,203
So many times

212
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:42,533
I am out of faces and I am gone

213
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,883
I am just like you

214
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,187

223
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,297
Why don't you handle this?

224
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:23,581

225
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:27,150

237
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,365
Now I go to work

238
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,373
You are retired

239
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:04,029
You are retired, okay?

240
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:07,759

241
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:10,404

How you doing, huh?

243
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,905
Some people they sleep
a lot before they died.

244
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,953
Is that ridiculous?

245
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,058
Fuck.

246
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:53,164
Herny, everything okay?

247
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,064
Shut up

248
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:55,469

I know you're just under-educated drank who

00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,718

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,409
But I paying you to assist him for living

252
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,833
You're not assisting him!

253
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,704
I told you that take the lock
off of his bathroom door!

254
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:11,115

at night and he forget

00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:12,500
So you have to be there for him

256
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,337
Make him feel safe

257
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:15,978

258
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,527

259
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:21,049

Don't make me come down here

267
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,269
Okay?

296
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:11,647
Maybe we can get back

297
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:14,748
You fear to like it?

298
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:19,351

"He just fuck their shit up and the ..."

305
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,092
"The ladies cried for me ..."

306
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:55,018
"At the funeral"

307
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:57,602
"Because I ate around no more to,"

308
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,139
"Dig that splited up ..."

309
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,422

00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,600
Toni

313
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,291
You know it's funny that
I spend a lot of time

314
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:20,074
Trying not to have an deal

315
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:22,589
Not really committed

316
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,878
I am a substitute teacher

317
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:27,219
There are no real responsibility to teach

318
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:29,891
The responsibility to maintain the order

319
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:32,568
Make sure that nobody has killed
anybody in the classroom

320
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:34,855
And then make that into next period

321
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:36,856
"She used to be an sweet girl"

322
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,951
"She never seems to be
satisfied with her life..."

323
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:41,511
"And why should she have been"

324
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:44,311
"An mother of mine gave her
everything she needed ... "

325
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,996
"So why she become so angry?"

326
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:50,234
"So miserable, so mean for all of a sudden"

327
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:51,452
"We don't know."

328
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,711
"Frankly, it doesn't reflected on us."

329
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,613
"We were good parents"

330
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,546
"But still, she will repay us for all we've done"

331
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,597
"Like killing herself"

332
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,601
"Stupid and selfish Child"

333
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:06,891
"Now she will never get into Princeton"
(Princeton is an U.S. well-known university)

334
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,930
No name.

335
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:17,679
"Hello, its this Mathias Dead"

336
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,061
"I can't do it anymore"

337
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:23,091
" I ...um I quit! "

338
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,770
Oh, if it isn't ... good
afternoon Dr. Parker

339
00:21:33,603 --> 00:21:35,659

Haha Mr. Seaboldt,  he

But I don't make processive ... haha

345
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:06,244
I mean, I do ...

346
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,153
in a tragic sort of way

347
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,382
What are you doing here Mr Sea?

348
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:12,676
Um I am coming in fill for

349

Talked shit.

351
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,806
You can be slapped like a bitch

358
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:35,256

655
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:54,195
For the rest of our lives

656
00:43:54,937 --> 00:43:56,618
The power to be

So, to defend ourselves

661
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:11,516
And fighting against the similarities of
this dumbs into our thought processors.

662
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:13,553

664
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,550

00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:48,686
I spend all the time on my own

725
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:51,993
Yeah

726
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:00,279
- My mother hated my father passionately
- Are they for there not permanently ...

727
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:02,056
Just watched a lot of TV

728
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:04,911
- For the only time that I don't feel naked
- Not a temporary one

729
00:48:05,191 --> 00:48:07,835
- I teached for selfish reasons
- My mother was Smith Madison

730
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,511
... I need an good control

731
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,196
- I need ... to get those kids
- It does great similar things ...

732
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:14,443
- Thats moments in school ...
- Is all she has ...

733
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,970
It must be like an shit end up there

734
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,211
That situation you ever have.

735
00:48:23,506 --> 00:48:25,158
So what is your story?

736
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:28,481
My story?

737
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:38,492
I just ... umm I just taking one thing at a time

738
00:48:39,092 --> 00:48:42,255
Why waste your life, you know
something worth to adore?

739
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:44,634
I teach every day i mean, when we

740
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,641
you are not really know me

741
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:51,150
So what happened to you?

742
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:02,338
You don't want something more permanent?

743
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:21,612
- Hi
- Where have you been?

744
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:23,544
Why? I was out.

745
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:27,638
- With a colleague?
- The boy or girl?

746
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:31,624
A woman

747
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,496
Made me feel like so stupid
Why treat me like a child?

748
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:45,064
- Because you're a kid, I am sorry I wasn't expecting this
- All you have to do is ...

749
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:47,106
Tell me that you will be home later

750
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:49,937
Back up, alright?

751
00:49:53,543 --> 00:49:59,788
I am not obliged to you, okay?  I mean
you welcome to stay here, but you know?

752
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,446
You don't have to get expectation of me, alright?

753
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:06,591
This is an temporary thing, you ...
you able to stay here, but ...

754
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,800
Eventually you have to go,
you understand that?

755
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,019
- I think it is important you to ...
- Its clear.

756
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:13,432
I get it, you want me to go now?

757
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,117
I got better considering
than clean up the stuffs

758
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,571
I can't believe you made dinner

759
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:24,666
From what?

760
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:29,128
Goceries, from the Goceries store

761
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,513
Wow, it's really nice kid

762
00:50:37,606 --> 00:50:41,186
Its been long time since
somebody cooked me out at home

763
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:46,400
Thank you Erica.
We all have problems, we all have things dealing with

764
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,436
And we all ...

765
00:50:52,343 --> 00:50:58,942
Take them home with us at night,
take them to work in the morning

766
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:14,620
I think that is helpness, that
realization for both parties

767
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:21,094
Being ex-drafting that in the Sea

768
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:27,141
No bowies and safety, when
you thought you will be the one

769
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:30,497
Falling the bowie,

770
00:51:45,614 --> 00:51:47,491
Hello

771
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,639
- Anything for dinner?
- Tell me all about it from the beginning -

772
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:57,547
- You don't care
- Oh no ...

773
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,458
- I am so much in care, love
- relax

774
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:03,191
You are so self-containing

775
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:08,412
Give me a kiss

776
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:15,725
Come on, come with me, I
will sort thing out with you

777
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,660
- Come on
- Stop it

778
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:31,569
Do you remember when
I bought this for you?

779
00:52:35,245 --> 00:52:42,768
The beautiful summer in "Vennz" before I travel
to Arizona to brought you an ring with passionate

780
00:53:06,972 --> 00:53:08,193
" You're suck! "

781
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:10,776
- Bloody?
- Yeah

782
00:54:46,442 --> 00:54:50,457
- Grandpa, you doing any writing of your journal?
- No ...

783
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:54,256
I don't remember much

784
00:54:55,864 --> 00:55:01,027
When you were there,
you can't think in this place

785
00:55:01,027 --> 00:55:03,527
Cannot make new memories

786
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:24,010
Thank you

787
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,039
- You alright?
- What?

788
00:57:22,915 --> 00:57:25,716
- You see me?
- You see me standing here?

789
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:27,892
Yes, I see you here

790
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:35,064
Oh God, its so re-linkness, thank you.

791
00:57:55,788 --> 00:58:03,148
" Carol, there is no way for us to do this, I spoke with the
Super-attendant, its agree to let you out for the rest of year "

792
00:58:03,882 --> 00:58:08,452
" It is where it is, take your pension
and fill out your flabulous ... "

793
00:58:09,978 --> 00:58:11,260
" Send greetings to Bastards ..."

794
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:24,097
I am Chairman before. If I am Chairman,
I just want to tell someone to fuck off.

795
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:26,971
I think I am sick

796
00:58:27,918 --> 00:58:29,933
- Why?
-  I crossed the line today

797
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:33,159
I mean the whole thing is fuck

798
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:37,094
Whole thing is fuck, is not?

799
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:40,339
What's up, Dr.Parker?

800
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:42,979
Can we get over It? I have
got other things to do.

801
00:58:45,862 --> 00:58:49,243
Well, what are your plan for after High School
ever since you will not go to University?

802
00:58:49,514 --> 00:58:50,975
I don't know

803
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:55,969
Hanging out with my boyfriend,
designing an modelling shit ...

804
00:58:57,392 --> 00:59:00,292
- Be my friends' band (music)
- I have your ten year scores report

805
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:01,224
Do you know what they said?

806
00:59:01,224 --> 00:59:03,179
Fail, Fail, Fail

807
00:59:03,408 --> 00:59:05,312
- F, F, F
- F, F, F yah

808
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,964
You know what that means?
Its mean you don't care

809
00:59:07,964 --> 00:59:09,532
You're brilliant.

810
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,516
Can I go now?

811
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:19,152
Oh god, you are an shallow disgusting creature.

812
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:26,489
You want to know the truth?
One, you not gonna be in an Band,

813
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:29,963
Or an Model Missy, because you have no ambition.

814
00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:35,126
With no skills, you will gonna be the 80% of
the U.S. workforce for minimum wages job

815
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:36,814
Which mean the way you living
for the rest of your life

816
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,778
Until they replaced by computers.

817
00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:40,587
- I don't care
- Two, ....

818
00:59:40,587 --> 00:59:43,969
The only talent you ever have
is getting men to fuck you.

819
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:46,552
Your life will be become an part of pain

820
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:48,024
Now, can you won't say it again

821
00:59:48,024 --> 00:59:51,505
Not for one more day,
not one more hour!

822
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:55,796
It will get worse, much worse!

823
00:59:57,372 --> 01:00:02,657
Everyday I came in this office and I
listened your kids to shit-off yourself!

824
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:08,966
Its so easy to be careless, it takes
curse and courage to take cares

825
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:12,206
None of you have any of these qualities.

826
01:00:14,174 --> 01:00:18,290
- Get out!  Just get out! Get out!
- Fuck You!!

827
01:00:20,632 --> 01:00:21,452
* Bang - shut the door *

828
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,971
- I am totally burn out
- No you were not.

829
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:29,033
- I am.
- I mean I don't know how you make it through the day.

830
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:33,991
Listen, seriously what do you
think you can take these pills right?

831
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,969
I mean, there are lot of rumors there.

832
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:42,281
Oh come on, I don't dig these things,
I can be an Master of these parents

833
01:00:42,757 --> 01:00:45,299
I will be help them out to throw
the fucking kids out of the window

834
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:47,334
Come on, you're the best.

835
01:00:48,454 --> 01:00:51,088
I'll tell you my opinion, the
worst thing about this job

836
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:54,130
Is that nobody say thank you

837
01:00:55,805 --> 01:00:56,766
- No
- No

838
01:00:57,781 --> 01:01:00,184
I'm here to say thank you

839
01:01:00,604 --> 01:01:02,335
Your doing the job, none of us could do

840
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,958
None of us.

841
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:10,561
- Grace
- Have I ever I told you that you're the only person

842
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:11,936
That I have to talk to

843
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:23,647
- Hi Henry
- What happened?

844
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,783
They called to your house

845
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,808
- Your grandfather felt his chest pain
- Then?

846
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,608
Doctors said his condition is stable

847
01:01:33,434 --> 01:01:35,160
He doesn't have a lot of time

848
01:01:37,952 --> 01:01:40,198
- I am so sorry Henry
- How long ...

849
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:41,366
Have you been here?

850
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:44,362
Since this morning, I didn't
know how to get an hold of you?

851
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,301
I don't know where you work

852
01:01:47,827 --> 01:01:50,509
You are having a whole day with him?

853
01:01:58,913 --> 01:02:01,138
Hello, grandpa

854
01:02:01,574 --> 01:02:03,873
I am still hanging in there, as I see

855
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:10,654
Hey sweetheart, your mother
has visited me today

856
01:02:11,402 --> 01:02:14,119
Did you seen her?

857
01:02:16,894 --> 01:02:21,721
- No
- I told her I was afraid  to leave you

858
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:25,417
... But she promised

859
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:28,967
- That she would look after you
- Sure, she means that all the time

860
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:35,225
Patricia tell me that

861
01:02:36,387 --> 01:02:39,304
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

862
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:53,168
- What do you need to forgiven me, daddy?
- Those things

863
01:02:55,448 --> 01:02:58,456
You know, the things I did

864
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:03,514
All you have to do is

865
01:03:04,574 --> 01:03:08,528
- Always take care of me
- Why did you afraid of me?

866
01:03:09,304 --> 01:03:13,334
No, daddy, not

867
01:03:13,334 --> 01:03:17,509
I know how you get sometimes
you get little mixed up

868
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:23,564
You feel responsible for the
things that you didn't do

869
01:03:23,864 --> 01:03:26,836
So I was the one who hurted you?

870
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,570
No Sir, that wasn't you

871
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:35,142
I wish this wasn't true

872
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:40,564
Patricia, I always love you

873
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:55,104
Daddy, you can feel free to
leave, when are you be ready

874
01:03:56,976 --> 01:04:01,539
Do you know that?
Thats okay.

875
01:04:02,153 --> 01:04:04,103
There is nothing to fear

876
01:04:19,508 --> 01:04:20,546
Come on

877
01:04:21,009 --> 01:04:22,024
Let's leave from here

878
01:04:25,704 --> 01:04:32,735
Is Patricia be your mom?
What happened to her?

879
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:34,918
She left a while ago

880
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:37,471
You mean she died?

881
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,705
How did she dead?

882
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:52,664
My father left when I was a kid,
I don't really remember him

883
01:04:54,484 --> 01:04:58,688
Its always the three of us,
Mother and Grandpa and I together

884
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:01,281
In this house

885
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:07,608
I've found her... on the foor

886
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,582
... She was taking enough pills

887
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:23,311
And Grandpa at that moment,
seriously kinda of lost ...

888
01:05:23,682 --> 01:05:25,082
* Tape written - For Henry *

889
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:31,114
I sat with my grandpa's bench and
we watched her to came and go in

890
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,268
How old were you?

891
01:05:39,338 --> 01:05:51,670
Seven, I am kinda not for sure, i think my
mother was young when something happened

892
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,001
- With my grandpa
- Were you afraid of it?

893
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:58,544
No

894
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:02,550
Did she ever say anything to you?

895
01:06:06,715 --> 01:06:08,322
No

896
01:06:09,322 --> 01:06:14,720
But looking back on it, I think she
protected me on her own way

897
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,759
How?

898
01:06:20,586 --> 01:06:22,812
She made me locked my door at night

899
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:54,405
The park is now empty in bare,
and we feel ... ashamed about it

900
01:06:56,187 --> 01:07:00,244
The jungle jam slide and
swing and roost together

901
01:07:01,511 --> 01:07:04,080
I also terribly alone now

902
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:06,403
Where did the ... all children gone

903
01:07:07,266 --> 01:07:09,502
Didn't they know the park needed them?

904
01:07:10,757 --> 01:07:14,443
The child's intelligent heart can flatten
the death of many dark places

905
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,838
I cannot find any kinda
delicated moment of attachment

906
01:07:36,654 --> 01:07:39,364
- Hi Mr. Barthe
- Hello Meredith

907
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:43,471
- How's going?
- Fine, I am alright ...

908
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,293
- I made a picture for you

909
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:49,164
Come here

910
01:07:50,198 --> 01:07:52,270
- you did?
- Yeah

911
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:04,813
Wow, it's beautiful and,
you have the great talent

912
01:08:05,641 --> 01:08:07,345
- Thanks
- Are you doing this for an long time?

913
01:08:07,345 --> 01:08:09,361
I've been doing this since I was a kid.

914
01:08:11,982 --> 01:08:14,534
Man with no face, in a empty room

915
01:08:14,736 --> 01:08:16,359
Is this how you see me, Meredith?

916
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:19,925
I don't know how I see you

917
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:24,503
This is just how I feel in your situation

918
01:08:24,906 --> 01:08:28,106
Don't you ever think about who is
going to teach you from the outside

919
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:31,104
- In real life?
- I guess so

920
01:08:32,244 --> 01:08:35,823
- Does this place seem real to you?
- I watched him down the school

921
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,407
You always seem so sad

922
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:48,775
If you are having an hard times ...
and if you need someone to talk to

923
01:08:52,245 --> 01:08:54,660
- Meredith
- Yes Sir

924
01:08:59,495 --> 01:09:03,700
- Do you need someone to talk to?
- Yes, will you talk to me?

925
01:09:06,187 --> 01:09:10,484
When you talk to me, you give
me is like you really see me

926
01:09:11,535 --> 01:09:12,892
I do see you Meredith

927
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:19,459
- Would you like to see Dr. Parker?
- Oh come on, I don't want to find any psychological consultor

928
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:21,928
I am not, I am not ...

929
01:09:23,142 --> 01:09:25,144
What can I do for you?

930
01:09:26,608 --> 01:09:32,940
Its like you said we brought up to the...there is nothing
left, nothing to realize and how fuck up the things are ...

931
01:09:33,424 --> 01:09:36,122
It's not enough, I won't last

932
01:09:37,853 --> 01:09:40,551
Listen to me, just Listen

933
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:52,783
We are all the same, we all feel pain,
and we all have to pay us for our lifes

934
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,222
Life is very very confusing, I know

935
01:09:57,622 --> 01:10:01,440
I don't have the answer,
but I know if you write it out

936
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,982
It all be okay.

937
01:10:05,874 --> 01:10:09,148
- Mr. Barthes, do you like me?
- Of course I do

938
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,886
- Meredith, please don't
- I want you to help

939
01:10:21,986 --> 01:10:24,542
- Please, please
- No, no

940
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:26,983
- You don't ...
- You said you like me, please...

941
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,111
Please, please ...

942
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:36,731
Oh please, don't put me away, please just
hold on to me, and you said everything will be fine

943
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:39,574
Everything will be fine,
It is okay, please.

944
01:10:45,466 --> 01:10:49,913
- Please... no, no...
- Meredith, wait a second

945
01:10:50,676 --> 01:10:52,734
- What's going on?
- What?  Hey (Meredith)

946
01:10:53,113 --> 01:10:54,654
- Meredith, Meredith
- What were you doing?

947
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,693
Meredith, I am sorry.

948
01:10:57,871 --> 01:10:59,322
- What were you doing?
- What?

949
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:01,840
What are you doing?

950
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,246
- Excuse me?!
- You was just touching her

951
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:06,261
What do you ... what do you insalivating?

952
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:09,151
It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl

953
01:11:09,151 --> 01:11:11,538
It is inappropriate, she needed
someone to talk with to

954
01:11:11,538 --> 01:11:13,966
- What do you think I'm doing? lady
- I don't know what I am doing.

955
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,610
"Just make me close."

956
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,164
What do you think I am fucking provert?
Is that what you insalivating?

957
01:11:19,427 --> 01:11:21,192
She needed someone to talk to her

958
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,526
- Why would you touching her?
- I wasn't touching her

959
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:26,355
"Its alright my dear"

960
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:30,596
"Patricia"

961
01:11:30,939 --> 01:11:33,483
I'm not ... not a sick old man!

962
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:36,932
Is that the way you thinking of me?

963
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,610
Is that what you think?

964
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:43,477
I just wanted to help her!

965
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,768
- Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
- What am I supposed to think?

966
01:11:53,904 --> 01:11:55,995
Fucking to your fucking judgement!

967
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:16,326
Hello, no he's not home.

968
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:42,504
Hello Mr. Barthes

969
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:50,738
Whenever you feel like you are ready
to have some papers downstairs

970
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,803
I need you to take care of them

971
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,146
I am sorry.

972
01:13:44,423 --> 01:13:47,063
I wish things would be different

973
01:13:49,669 --> 01:13:57,060
I tried, you know, fuck
the things it is ... we all

974
01:14:01,914 --> 01:14:04,656
We all have problems with all
the things we dealing with

975
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:11,166
Somedays would better than others, Some days
we're not so great, somedays we have limited spaces

976
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:15,460
For others.

977
01:14:31,194 --> 01:14:34,017
Good day, sit down, have a breakfast.

978
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:36,978
Want some milk?

979
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:43,433
These kids need something else

980
01:14:45,769 --> 01:14:47,865
They don't need me.

981
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:56,720
- You don't have it?
- Yeah, I'm not hungry

982
01:15:06,886 --> 01:15:13,160
- You know, you can't keep living on the street.
- No I am not, I mean I here staying with you.

983
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:16,918
You can not stay here with me.

984
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,011
- Its not good for you
- This not true

985
01:15:20,754 --> 01:15:22,996
You're the only family that I ever have

986
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,807
Well I can't be your family.

987
01:15:33,879 --> 01:15:35,928
I can't give you what you needed

988
01:15:45,993 --> 01:15:49,047
- You have to understand, you should be ...
- You are good ...

989
01:15:49,664 --> 01:15:51,887
And gentle ...

990
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:55,405
You are the most guy

991
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:02,484
I love you Henry

992
01:16:10,207 --> 01:16:11,954
- Come in, hi
- Hi

993
01:16:14,121 --> 01:16:15,364
Hello there

994
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:20,888
- Erica ...
- Don't let them take me ...

995
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:22,430
Please ...

996
01:16:23,824 --> 01:16:25,910
- Noo ...
- Listen, you should ...

997
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:29,822
You are all that I have, please...

998
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:33,840
- Don't let me go
- You should go, sorry

999
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,675
- No, no ...
- No, don't do this ...

1000
01:16:37,354 --> 01:16:38,386
- Henry! Henry!
- You should go

1001
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:40,083
- Henry!
- You have to let go

1002
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:42,156
- Henry!
- You have to ...

1003
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:45,727
- Henry!
- You have to leg go now

1004
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:47,816
Henry!

1005
01:16:48,116 --> 01:16:50,334
- Thanks, you help me this
- Yes

1006
01:16:50,384 --> 01:16:53,257
- Henry! Henry!
- Come on.

1007
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:57,745
- No! No! ...
- Things will be okay

1008
01:16:58,522 --> 01:17:00,348
Don't do this

1009
01:17:00,348 --> 01:17:04,072
- You gonna be okay
- No! No! No!

1010
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:07,119
No! ...

1011
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:58,216
Well ... I does feel awful for her

1012
01:17:59,851 --> 01:18:01,660
- For who?
- For our school

1013
01:18:02,506 --> 01:18:07,362
It may sound strange but I always
felt that the school has its spirit

1014
01:18:09,138 --> 01:18:12,741
Its not just an budgetful
buildings, bu they're alive.

1015
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:21,224
I just can't understand
where are all the parents?

1016
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:26,945
I don't know

1017
01:18:32,605 --> 01:18:37,623
It was in my room for two hours and I saw only
one parent, where are they? Where is everybody?

1018
01:18:38,433 --> 01:18:41,126
- We don't know
- Its impossible.

1019
01:18:41,599 --> 01:18:44,437
No annoying, its slience, no bombs

1020
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:46,700
Doesn't happen that way

1021
01:18:47,233 --> 01:18:49,846
Starting the whisper, then nothing

1022
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:53,123
We had an music once, hadn't we?

1023
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,229
Yes, we did

1024
01:18:58,272 --> 01:19:01,239
Do you remember that night, where
we have two parents at a time?

1025
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:05,150
And then we have more and the
many more waiting in the waiting list

1026
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:09,791
And halls were filled with joys and
celebrations. Now, its nothing.

1027
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:14,627
I remember the things passed.

1028
01:19:14,841 --> 01:19:17,130
I actually felt quite at home

1029
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:18,996
No parents

1030
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:24,819
I thought about how its appropriate,
Its like - A moment of the insight

1031
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:29,229
The reality of the fucking
problem in the first place

1032
01:19:35,262 --> 01:19:39,311
Some of us believe that
we can make a difference

1033
01:19:41,379 --> 01:19:44,016
And then sometimes when we wake up

1034
01:19:46,952 --> 01:19:48,785
And we realize we failed.

1035
01:19:54,808 --> 01:19:56,828
* Phone ringing*

1036
01:19:57,549 --> 01:19:58,269
* Beep - recording machine *

1037
01:20:00,739 --> 01:20:03,243

Thank you

1041
01:20:11,897 --> 01:20:12,697
* Beep - recording machine *

1042
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:37,948
" - You have good parents "
" - Bitch you shut up. "

1043
01:20:37,948 --> 01:20:40,235
"A Mother of mine gave her ... "

1044
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:41,990
" A Diet Bitch! "

1045
01:20:45,887 --> 01:20:52,112
" What sculpture supposed to be?  This sculpture so bad ..."
" Its has nothing to realize and how fuck up the things are ..."

1046
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:55,426
" - I won't stand that, Dad! "
" - Paint something more cheerful ..."

1047
01:20:55,586 --> 01:21:00,379
" We have to pay us our lives ..."
" Grow like your hair, lost some weight"

1048
01:21:00,379 --> 01:21:01,724
" We all gonna be okay "

1049
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:06,091
- Good morning
- Good morning

1050
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:08,305
Before we take class

1051
01:21:08,305 --> 01:21:13,347
I want to tell you that ...
today will be my last day with you

1052
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,456
You will have a permanent teacher on Monday.

1053
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:19,214
- Where will you going, Mr. Barthes?
- I will go to another school

1054
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:24,999
- We will miss you, man. I'll fuck with you.
- Yeah?

1055
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:27,761
All those teachers there in
this place ... they're "dickies"

1056
01:21:28,538 --> 01:21:31,282
Don't you get tired of
moving around all the time?

1057
01:21:31,482 --> 01:21:37,193
It's my job works, well I was coming
in here for a period of time ...

1058
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:42,718
So you don't have to turn in yourself a lot here ...
and then you will have an permanent teacher come in ...

1059
01:21:42,918 --> 01:21:44,524
And I leave

1060
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:53,250
"Attention to all teachers, this is an special
announcement from the Principle's Office. "

1061
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:57,474
" There will be all faulties meeting today
during the nutrients (meal time)"

1062
01:21:58,144 --> 01:22:00,896
" Students' nutrients period won't  be extended "

1063
01:22:00,896 --> 01:22:03,149
" For ten minutes, thank you."

1064
01:22:48,938 --> 01:22:54,466
I invited you here today to
discuss, the status things

1065
01:22:54,995 --> 01:22:59,023
I know they wasn't ...
I know that there isn't ...

1066
01:23:06,835 --> 01:23:10,527
- I am sorry ...
- We all need something

1067
01:23:11,128 --> 01:23:17,895
To extract from the complexity and reality

1068
01:23:18,799 --> 01:23:21,698
More or less to think about
where they came from?

1069
01:23:22,592 --> 01:23:31,888
More or less to think about the struggle that
it takes to become somebody to get out of ...

1070
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,074
... to get out of the ...

1071
01:23:38,737 --> 01:23:41,436
The sea of painful,
we all have to get out of it.

1072
01:23:51,447 --> 01:23:53,040
- Hello Meredith
- Hello

1073
01:23:55,161 --> 01:23:57,191
Haven't seen you in class lately?

1074
01:23:57,973 --> 01:23:59,498
Where have you been?

1075
01:23:59,988 --> 01:24:02,431
- Baking
- Oh I see

1076
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:06,142
- Yah
- I am happy to see you because it is my last day

1077
01:24:07,249 --> 01:24:08,915
How ironic!

1078
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:14,410
Listen, I was thinking,
I bought this for myself

1079
01:24:15,386 --> 01:24:19,668
Maybe you could make better use of it.

1080
01:24:31,591 --> 01:24:34,378
- I like that, its best
- You can have that one

1081
01:24:34,882 --> 01:24:36,593
It's mine

1082
01:24:38,124 --> 01:24:40,422
But, can you have this one?

1083
01:24:41,808 --> 01:24:44,314
- It's better for you anyway
- Thanks

1084
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:47,298
I am sorry.

1085
01:24:48,919 --> 01:24:52,476
If I have hurted you in any way, I um ...

1086
01:24:54,695 --> 01:25:03,343
- I know that its tough right now, for you, but its not gonna your wish ...
- Goodbye Mr. Barthes.

1087
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,707
Goodbye Meredith.

1088
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:59,502
They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to the temporary problem

1089
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:03,334
How well would you know?

1090
01:26:05,747 --> 01:26:09,267
My name is Meredith and
I want to kill myself

1091
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:42,830
Meredith

1092
01:26:43,921 --> 01:26:44,780
No

1093
01:26:47,132 --> 01:26:48,980
Henry

1094
01:26:51,334 --> 01:26:54,749
Things would gonna be fine.
Things would gonna be fine.

1095
01:26:57,492 --> 01:27:01,087
Things would gonna be okay.

1096
01:27:04,984 --> 01:27:12,279
We have such a responsibility to guide
a young so that they don't end up ...

1097
01:27:14,243 --> 01:27:15,902
Falling apart.

1098
01:27:18,271 --> 01:27:20,160
Falling by the way side.

1099
01:27:23,466 --> 01:27:26,046
Becoming insignificant.

1100
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:50,219
I realized something today

1101
01:28:53,347 --> 01:29:01,744
I'm not a person you are,
you shouldn't be here.

1102
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:06,655
I am not here

1103
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:14,649
You may see me, but I am empty.

1104
01:29:51,144 --> 01:29:56,167
Failing, we failing

1105
01:29:59,068 --> 01:30:05,875
Failure does have sense of mean,
we left, everyone went down.

1106
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:08,424
Including ourselves.

1107
01:31:18,046 --> 01:31:21,602
And I am walking an Hall way to the class.

1108
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:31,338
How many of you have ever felt the
weight of presence down on your chest?

1109
01:31:34,179 --> 01:31:36,442
I have.
* Rise hands*

1110
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:46,419
Everyone?  Well, poem wrote about
these things over 100 years ago

1111
01:31:48,437 --> 01:31:51,260
So as we read

1112
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:58,771
We can see that the house of
Russia is not nearly an old ...

1113
01:31:59,622 --> 01:32:02,532
The crapping castle there be repaired.

1114
01:32:03,856 --> 01:32:07,564
It is also an state of existence.

1115
01:32:13,709 --> 01:32:17,829
" During the whole whole dark dark soundless day "

1116
01:32:18,064 --> 01:32:23,472
" In the autumn of that year, when
the clouds are pressively low in heaven "

1117
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:28,356
" I have been passing alone on the horse's back "

1118
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:32,037
" Through the Singletary nearly track in the country"

1119
01:32:32,899 --> 01:32:37,078
" That lane found myself that is
 shaved to be evening dawn"

1120
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:40,642
" Was in the view of mountain
Connery House of Russia"

1121
01:32:41,874 --> 01:32:44,321
" I know not how it was "

1122
01:32:44,995 --> 01:32:51,493
" With the first scream of the building, I
sensibly in suffering gloomy probated in my spirit "

1123
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:55,721
" I looked for poem for some
blank scape for domain "

1124
01:32:56,209 --> 01:33:01,341
" Poem for beathe walls, Poem for
white trunks of decayed trees "

1125
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:04,845
" With the other depression souls "

1126
01:33:06,061 --> 01:33:09,514
" There wasn't an iceness "

1127
01:33:11,182 --> 01:33:14,267
" A sinking."

1128
01:33:14,814 --> 01:33:18,250
" Seeking an Heart "

1129
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:31,404
" Detachment "

1130
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:34,405
