00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,991
When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,

3
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:44,994
with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,

4
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,289
I started having these dreams of flying

5
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,125
I was free

6
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,966
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

7
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,277
In cryo, you don't dream at all

8
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:19,320
It doesn't feel like six years

9
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:21,823
More like a fifth of teguila
and an ass-kicking

10
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,206
Tommy was the scientist, not me

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,502
He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space

12
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,878
to find the answers

13
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,381
Are we there yet?

14
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,258
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

15
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,384
We're there.

16
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,927
It's about your brother

17
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:49,393
So, a week before
Tommy's gonna ship out,

18
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:53,188
a guy with a gun ends his journey
for the paper in his wallet

19
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:58,359
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

20
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,362
You will be hungry.
You will be weak.

21
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:04,033
If you feel nausea,
please use the sacks--

22
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,117
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist

23
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:09,413
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret

24
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,304
Up ahead was Pandora

25
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:30,683
You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there

26
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:44,114
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,033
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

28
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:51,663
And since your genome is identical to his,
you could step into his shoes,

29
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,582
so to speak.

30
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,550
It'd be a fresh start
on a new world

31
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,893
And the pay is good

32
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,478
Very good.

33
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,795
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,213
Remember, people,
you lose that mask,

35
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,968
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

36
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,388
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

37
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,850
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

38
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:55,728
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.

39
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,266
One life ends,

40
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,478
another begins

41
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:47,237
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!

42
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:50,783
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

43
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:54,870
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

44
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,540
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

45
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,882
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

46
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,764
There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine

47
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,810
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude

48
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,939
I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass

49
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:30,781
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

50
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,576
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy

51
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,413
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

52
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,206
Well, well, ladies.

53
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,502
Look at all this fresh meat!

54
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:53,428
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

55
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,014
fighting for freedom

56
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,271
Look out, hot rod!

57
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,608
But out here they're just hired guns,

58
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,528
taking the money,
working for the company

59
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:10,987
Check this out, man.

60
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,115
Meals on wheels.

61
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,327
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

62
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,245
I got two guys free
in about 20 minutes!

63
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,872
Got it! Need them!

64
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,425
You're not in Kansas anymore

65
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:38,766
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,603
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

67
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,481
If there is a hell,

68
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,862
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

69
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:54,865
Out there, beyond that fence,

70
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,286
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

71
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:02,540
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

72
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:09,213
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

73
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:11,632
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

74
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:14,509
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

75
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,930
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

76
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,391
They are very hard to kill.

77
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:26,855
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

78
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,567
I will not succeed.

79
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,153
Not with all of you.

80
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,283
If you wish to survive,

81
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:40,244
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

82
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:43,247
You've got to obey the rules.

83
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,040
Pandora rules.

84
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,002
Rule number one--

85
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,754
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

86
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,548
to put your mind at ease

87
00:07:54,925 --> 00:08:00,430
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

88
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,350
Wow! You look just like him.

89
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:07,187
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

90
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,273
...into the bio-lab.

91
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:14,528
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

92
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:15,862
- Hi.
- Hey.

93
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,531
Link-- Here's the link room right here.

94
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,908
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

95
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,786
Me and Norm are here to drive

96
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:27,040
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars

97
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:32,129
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives

98
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,173
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

99
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,634
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

100
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:40,511
Damn! They got big.

101
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:43,139
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

102
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,558
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

103
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,519
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

104
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:49,480
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

105
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,481
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

106
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,359
There's yours.

107
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,653
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

108
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,615
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

109
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,014
Looks like him.

110
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,101
No, it looks like you.

111
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:31,145
This is your avatar now, Jake.

112
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,778
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

113
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,657
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

114
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,493
or something

115
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,249
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

116
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:53,168
which is insanely expensive

117
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,380
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

118
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,633
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

119
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,759
You know, what we see, what we feel.

120
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:04,554
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

121
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,057
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

122
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:09,934
All right. Whatever.

123
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,563
So--

124
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,066
Well, here I am,

125
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,235
doing science.

126
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,989
They're coming out!

127
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,575
Attention.
Drivers coming out of link

128
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:33,250
Oh, God.

129
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,879
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

130
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:43,302
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

131
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,847
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

132
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,433
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

133
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:53,269
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

134
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,605
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

135
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,982
Here she is,
Cinderella back from the ball.

136
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,778
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

137
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:07,243
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

138
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,495
May the All Mother

139
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,664
smile upon our first meeting

140
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,960
Not bad.
You sound a little formal

141
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,337
I studied for five years

142
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,506
but there is much to learn

143
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:25,219
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

144
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:29,807
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

145
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:33,519
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

146
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,019
He's dead.

147
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,065
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

148
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,485
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

149
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,073
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

150
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,493
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

151
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:50,827
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

152
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,496
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

153
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,999
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

154
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,960
He has no business sticking his nose
in my department.

155
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:02,798
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

156
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,019
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

157
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:17,937
Hover taxi, Delta runway.
Squawk ident.

158
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,070
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

159
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,239
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

160
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,241
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

161
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,332
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

162
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,376
but now I see that
you're intentionally screwing me.

163
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:44,005
Grace, you know,
I enjoy our little talks.

164
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:51,846
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

165
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,599
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

166
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,183
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,269
How is this in any way lucky?

168
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,104
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

169
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,106
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

170
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,109
A Marine we can use.

171
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,070
I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.

172
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:09,615
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

173
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,575
Look, look, you're supposed
to be winning the hearts

174
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,701
and the minds of the natives.

175
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,620
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

176
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,205
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

177
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,956
then they'll start trusting us.

178
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,042
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

179
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,126
but after, what, how many years?

180
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:23,754
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

181
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,091
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

182
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,301
Right. Come here.

183
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,136
I can't-- I can't--

184
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,309
This is why we're here.
Unobtanium.

185
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,480
Because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

186
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:44,817
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

187
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,777
It's what pays for your science.

188
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,282
Now, those savages are threatening
our whole operation,

189
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:52,615
we're on the brink of war,

190
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,911
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

191
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,498
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

192
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,927
So, how much link time have you logged?

193
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,639
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

194
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:21,061
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

195
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,813
Zip. But I read a manual.

196
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,817
Tell me you're joking.

197
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,528
This is cool.

198
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,404
Let's go.

199
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:37,036
Don't. I got this.

200
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:44,000
So you just figured
you'd come out here,

201
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,711
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

202
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:50,548
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

203
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,927
What was going through your head?

204
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:55,846
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

205
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:59,225
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

206
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,979
Keep your arms in,
hands in, head down.

207
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:08,900
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

208
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,486
That shouldn't be hard for you.

209
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,404
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white--

210
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:14,907
Initiate link.

211
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,201
Run sequence unit three. Go.

212
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:19,745
Launching.

213
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,626
I have the first congruency.

214
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:40,557
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

215
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,600
Phase-lock 40%.

216
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,148
All right. Going in.

217
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:50,359
I'm going in in four.

218
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,030
Phase-lock 99%.
Link is stable.

219
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:16,759
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

220
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,428
Pupillary reflex is good

221
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:24,225
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

222
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:26,312
Hey, guys.

223
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,938
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

224
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:30,399
Good!

225
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,984
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

226
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,153
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

227
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,653
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

228
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,322
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

229
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,533
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

230
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:40,909
- that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

231
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,995
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

232
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,540
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

233
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:49,375
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

234
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,005
Distal motor control is good.
Good, Jake.

235
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,716
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

236
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,345
That's great, Jake.
Hold on, now.

237
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,679
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

238
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,307
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

239
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:06,477
- so take it easy.
- Wait.

240
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,019
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

241
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,521
Jake! Listen to me.
Jake!

242
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,857
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

243
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:14,692
- Buddy, listen to me.
- It's all good. I got this.

244
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:18,446
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

245
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,657
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

246
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,536
You need time to adjust to the avatar--
Whoa! Jake!

247
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,871
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

248
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:30,041
Sedate! Sedate him!
A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

249
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,419
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

250
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,546
By the numbers

251
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,047
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me

252
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,714
You're not used to your avatar body.

253
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,467
- This is dangerous.
- This is great

254
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,804
- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're gonna put you out

255
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,058
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

256
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,727
God damn it!
Bring them home!

257
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:51,438
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

258
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:57,068
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

259
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:58,737
I don't even have to play defense on it.

260
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,280
Hey, guys. Hey.

261
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,657
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!

262
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,535
Jake! Jake!
Excuse me.

263
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:08,705
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

264
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,249
Come on!

265
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,211
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

266
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,140
- Jeez! Sorry.
- Watch it!

267
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:49,954
Hey, Marine!

268
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,165
Damn.

269
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,378
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

270
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,132
Think fast.

271
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,176
Motor controI's looking good.

272
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:17,357
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

273
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,567
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

274
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,111
Hey, hey, hey!

275
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,864
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

276
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:25,406
That's kind of freaky.

277
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,951
Come on. Scat.

278
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,328
Good night.

279
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,166
Lights out!
See you at dinner, kiddies.

280
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,233
Welcome back.

281
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,536
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

282
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

283
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,752
Hold on a second.

284
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,173
Hey, Wainfleet!
Get it done!

285
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:27,760
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

286
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,431
Vine strike's still loose.

287
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,682
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

288
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,101
Watch it!

289
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:37,438
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

290
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,189
Or the biggest.

291
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:42,108
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

292
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,986
I thought you'd never ask.

293
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:48,490
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

294
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,628
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

295
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:04,298
This low gravity'll make you soft.

296
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,300
You get soft,

297
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:13,807
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

298
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,478
I pulled your record, Corporal.

299
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,980
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

300
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,234
Nothing like this here, though.

301
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:29,865
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

302
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,825
I figured it's just another hellhole.

303
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:34,327
I was First Recon myself.

304
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:37,664
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

305
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,501
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

306
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,045
I come out here?

307
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:47,132
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail louie?

308
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:51,761
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

309
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,518
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

310
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,479
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

311
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:08,362
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

312
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:15,411
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

313
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,162
- Clear!
- Clear!

314
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:27,463
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

315
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,215
Give me the goose bumps.

316
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,720
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

317
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,512
right on the ground.

318
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:37,724
Right in the hostiles' camp.

319
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,855
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

320
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,607
I want you to gain their trust.

321
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,442
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

322
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,069
or hammer them hard if they won't.

323
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,781
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

324
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:57,994
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

325
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:01,080
but you report to me.

326
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,292
Can you do that for me, son?

327
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,253
Hell, yeah, sir.

328
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,923
Well, all right, then.

329
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,854
Son, I take care of my own.

330
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:25,064
You get me what I need,

331
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:28,400
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

332
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:30,778
Your real legs.

333
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,532
That sounds real good, sir.

334
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:44,916
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

335
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:48,628
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

336
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:52,258
I have five congruencies.
Phase-lock 90%.

337
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,634
Link three ready.

338
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:55,970
All right, I'm going in.

339
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,375
Shut it down.
We're gonna stay a while.

340
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:15,590
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

341
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:22,222
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

342
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,352
You the man, Doc.

343
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:06,016
Prolemuris.
They're not aggressive.

344
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:12,105
Relax, Marine.
You're making me nervous.

345
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:20,280
So, how will they know we're here?

346
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:23,032
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

347
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,453
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

348
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:33,460
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

349
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,048
Wow! It's that fast?

350
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,386
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

351
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:47,266
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

352
00:26:47,391 --> 00:26:50,978
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

353
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,730
Okay. Sample.

354
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,986
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

355
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:03,615
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

356
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,826
Right.

357
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,522
So, here I go.

358
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:04,843
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

359
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:10,182
It's already pissed off.

360
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:13,269
Jake, that armor's too thick.
Trust me.

361
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:23,237
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

362
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,614
So, what do I do,
dance with it?

363
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:29,159
Just hold your ground.

364
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,634
Yeah? Come on!
What you got?

365
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:49,762
Oh, yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

366
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:53,142
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, bitch.

367
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:57,270
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

368
00:28:57,395 --> 00:29:00,273
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

369
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,359
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

370
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:07,615
Oh, shit.

371
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,878
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

372
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,340
Run! Definitely run!

373
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,152
I'm gonna have to call it, guys

374
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,113
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

375
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:21,117
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have
to hang on till morning

376
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:22,786
He won't make it till morning.

377
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,650
I don't have all goddamn night.

378
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,612
Come on! Come on!

379
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:36,188
Hey, wait. Don't!

380
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:40,818
Great.

381
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:41,836
Look, I know you probably
don't understand this,

382
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,135
but thank you.

383
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:55,726
Thank you.

384
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,190
That was pretty impressive.

385
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:06,862
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was--

386
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,536
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, where you going?

387
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:15,996
Wait up!

388
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:18,541
Just-- Hey, slow down.

389
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,668
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

390
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,838
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

391
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:29,092
You don't thank for this.

392
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,597
This is sad.
Very sad only.

393
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:37,643
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

394
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,271
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

395
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:46,943
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

396
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,864
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

397
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,614
Your fault!

398
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:54,827
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

399
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:58,581
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

400
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,123
Easy.

401
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:04,795
Fine. Fine.

402
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,090
If you love your little forest friends,

403
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,510
why not let them just kill my ass?

404
00:39:12,552 --> 00:39:14,262
What's the thinking?

405
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,766
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

406
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:24,190
You have a strong heart.

407
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,525
No fear.

408
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,909
But stupid!
Ignorant like a child.

409
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:43,751
Well, if I'm like a child, then--

410
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,586
Look, maybe you should teach me.

411
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:48,922
Sky People cannot learn.
You do not see.

412
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:50,840
Well, then teach me how to see.

413
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:53,427
- No one can teach you to see.
- Whoa.

414
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:57,222
Look, come on,
can't we talk?

415
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:02,061
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

416
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:08,608
You're like a baby.

417
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,407
I need your help.

418
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:19,327
You should not be here.

419
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:23,123
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

420
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:26,835
No.

421
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,547
Go back.

422
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,193
No!

423
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:15,175
What--

424
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:20,472
What are they?

425
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,809
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

426
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:26,519
Very pure spirits.

427
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:52,545
What was that all about?

428
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:55,757
Come.

429
00:41:57,259 --> 00:41:58,302
Come!

430
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,222
Where are we going?

431
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,525
Come.

432
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:19,907
What's your name?

433
00:42:20,032 --> 00:42:21,074
Shit!

434
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,643
Okay.

435
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:53,190
Calm people, calm

436
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:01,739
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

437
00:43:04,242 --> 00:43:07,079
These demons are forbidden here

438
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:10,206
There has been a sign

439
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:12,626
This is a matter for the Tsahik

440
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:18,423
Bring him

441
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,635
What's going on?

442
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:25,054
Wait.

443
00:43:28,057 --> 00:43:29,643
What's happening?

444
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:31,561
Hey!

445
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:42,925
Father

446
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:45,594
I see you

447
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:58,773
This creature--

448
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,152
why do you bring him here?

449
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:04,989
I was going to kill him

450
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,115
but there was a sing from Eywa

451
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:09,284
I have said

452
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,579
no dreamwalker will come here

453
00:45:11,704 --> 00:45:13,038
What's he saying?

454
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:15,958
His alien smell fills my nose

455
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,083
Hey, what's he saying?

456
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,961
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

457
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:24,382
Your father.
It's nice to meet you, sir.

458
00:45:28,012 --> 00:45:29,429
Step back!

459
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:34,768
I will look at this alien

460
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:36,436
That is Mother.

461
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:40,481
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

462
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:42,693
Who's Eywa?

463
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:51,284
What are you called?

464
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,621
Jake Sully.

465
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:06,300
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

466
00:46:07,717 --> 00:46:10,637
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

467
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:14,099
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

468
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,894
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

469
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:21,815
Just ask Dr. Augustine.
I'm no scientist.

470
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,317
What are you?

471
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,822
I was a Marine. A--

472
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:32,326
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

473
00:46:32,784 --> 00:46:33,994
A warrior!

474
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,579
I could kill him easily!

475
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:36,829
No!

476
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:41,501
This is the first warrior dreamwalker

477
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:43,461
we have seen

478
00:46:43,586 --> 00:46:46,340
We need to learn more about him

479
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,677
My Daughter--

480
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:55,056
you will teach him our way,

481
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:58,561
to speak and walk as we do

482
00:46:58,686 --> 00:47:02,231
Why me? That's not fair

483
00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:07,193
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

484
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:10,864
Learn well, Jakesully.

485
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:15,494
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

486
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,681
Good evening.

487
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,476
Please don't get up.

488
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:43,688
Excuse me.

489
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:47,150
Sorry.

490
00:47:50,278 --> 00:47:51,989
Hey, how you doing?

491
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,952
- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha

492
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:41,079
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!

493
00:48:42,956 --> 00:48:45,960
Come on back, kid. Come on.
That's it.

494
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,297
There you go.
There you go, there you go.

495
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:52,757
You're okay. You're okay.

496
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:55,760
Damn!
You were dug in like a tick.

497
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,432
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

498
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,271
And you are not gonna believe
where I am.

499
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,275
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

500
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,403
disappearing into the brush
with this angry thanator coming after him.

501
00:49:13,528 --> 00:49:16,447
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

502
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:18,867
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

503
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:22,246
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

504
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:25,081
"Jarhead clan"?

505
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,711
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.

506
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:34,257
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

507
00:49:34,382 --> 00:49:35,925
That's called taking the initiative, son.

508
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,512
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully. Sully.

509
00:49:38,637 --> 00:49:42,016
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

510
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:48,563
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

511
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:50,481
But no, no, no, they like mud.

512
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:54,485
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're--

513
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:58,157
Hey, can you-- Can somebody just--
Sector 12.

514
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:03,077
Okay, go, go, go, stop.
Stop--

515
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:05,289
Rich, stop!
That's-- Jesus!

516
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:11,461
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

517
00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:16,884
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

518
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:23,181
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.

519
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:28,603
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.

520
00:50:29,146 --> 00:50:31,815
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey.
Look. Look.

521
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,527
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

522
00:50:35,652 --> 00:50:39,364
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

523
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:42,617
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

524
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:45,871
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

525
00:50:46,664 --> 00:50:49,708
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

526
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:54,045
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

527
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,090
Well, we're wasting time.

528
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,175
I like this guy.

529
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:01,804
- Guys, right now--
- Okay, let's run through them again.

530
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:04,222
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

531
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:09,228
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

532
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:12,438
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

533
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,108
Got it.

534
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:16,402
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

535
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,237
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

536
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:23,742
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik

537
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,786
They become a mated pair.

538
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:29,123
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

539
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:33,626
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

540
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:35,086
Everything they know!

541
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:37,255
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

542
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,715
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

543
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,467
- Come on. That's--
- All right, knock it off, you two.

544
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:43,094
Let's go.
Village life starts early.

545
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:47,766
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

546
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:08,119
Easy, boy.

547
00:52:08,786 --> 00:52:10,831
Pale is female.

548
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,211
Okay. Easy, girl.

549
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:48,744
That is tsaheylu.
The bond

550
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:52,164
Feel her.

551
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:59,420
Feel her heartbeat.
Her breath.

552
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,217
Feel her strong legs.

553
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,014
You may tell her what to do.

554
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:10,306
Inside.

555
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:14,186
For now, say where to go.

556
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,440
Forward!

557
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:39,168
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.

558
00:53:40,628 --> 00:53:42,882
I knew you could speak English.

559
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:47,510
This alien will learn nothing,

560
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:49,554
a rock sees more,

561
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:51,806
look at him

562
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:02,275
Again.

563
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,820
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

564
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:08,407
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

565
00:54:08,532 --> 00:54:10,534
There's an outer row of columns.

566
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:13,369
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

567
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:17,081
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

568
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,585
That's how they move up and down.

569
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,503
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

570
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,922
Roger that.

571
00:54:24,047 --> 00:54:26,675
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

572
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,594
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

573
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:37,603
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

574
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:43,108
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

575
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:46,445
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

576
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,489
way up in the mountains.

577
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,574
The Hallelujah Mountains?

578
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:53,952
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

579
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:55,954
- Yeah.
- Yes!

580
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:03,128
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

581
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,476
We're getting close.

582
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:21,230
Yeah, look at my instruments.

583
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:24,275
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

584
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,610
We're VFR from here on.

585
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:28,570
What's VFR?

586
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:30,989
Means you gotta see where you're going.

587
00:55:31,114 --> 00:55:34,994
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

588
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:56,139
Oh, my God.

589
00:56:07,193 --> 00:56:08,527
You should see your faces.

590
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:38,139
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

591
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:58,244
Welcome to camp.

592
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:06,751
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

593
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:10,088
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

594
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:13,675
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy, you'll take the top one

595
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,177
She knew I was talking to the Colonel

596
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:19,889
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

597
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,599
so she's playing nice

598
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:26,730
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

599
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,695
Unit one. Beulah.
She's the least glitchy.

600
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:24,246
Holy shit!

601
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:27,041
Do not look in her eye.

602
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:37,342
Ikran is not horse

603
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,346
Once tsaheylu is made,

604
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:48,521
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life

605
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,199
To become taronyu, hunter,

606
00:59:01,324 --> 00:59:04,869
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you

607
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:09,458
- When?
- When you are ready.

608
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:03,012
Okay. This is video log 12

609
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,889
Time's 2132

610
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,686
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack

611
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,606
No, now.
When it's fresh

612
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:18,110
Okay, location, shack,

613
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,447
and the days are starting
to blur together

614
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:26,744
The language is a pain,
but, you know,

615
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:29,996
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition

616
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:31,706
- Navi.
- "Nari."

617
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,918
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!

618
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:35,376
Narrri!

619
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:38,338
Txur ni'ul. Stronger

620
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,639
Neytiri calls me skxawng.
It means moron

621
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:50,391
This is a very important part of it.

622
01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:52,603
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you

623
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:55,063
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

624
01:00:55,188 --> 01:00:56,815
it's "I see into you. I see you."

625
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,527
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too

626
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,862
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

627
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:05,157
I gotta run! Okay?
Let's go.

628
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,536
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day

629
01:01:11,454 --> 01:01:14,541
I have to trust my body
to know what to do

630
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,382
Yeah! Check it out!

631
01:01:22,215 --> 01:01:23,467
Oh, crap!

632
01:01:27,762 --> 01:01:32,601
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

633
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:34,894
the tiniest scents and sounds

634
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:45,239
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals

635
01:01:46,072 --> 01:01:48,701
I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final

636
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:52,454
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know

637
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:55,206
You need to listen to what she says

638
01:01:55,331 --> 01:01:58,460
Try to see the forest
through her eyes

639
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:01,130
Excuse me.
This is my video log here

640
01:02:16,561 --> 01:02:19,106
With Neytiri,
it's learn fast or die

641
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,525
You gotta be kidding me.

642
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:53,724
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace
into the village

643
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:55,518
Look how big you are

644
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:57,478
It's the first time
since her school was closed down

645
01:02:57,603 --> 01:02:59,396
You are so pretty

646
01:03:00,898 --> 01:03:03,692
No, you don't.
Come back here.

647
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:06,570
Bon appe'tit

648
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:35,766
Come on, Marine.

649
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,668
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

650
01:04:03,793 --> 01:04:06,005
the people have to the forest

651
01:04:06,505 --> 01:04:09,300
She talks about a network of energy

652
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:12,677
that flows through all living things

653
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:16,891
She says all energy is only borrowed,

654
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:20,393
and one day you have to give it back

655
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,376
I see you

656
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,668
brother

657
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,338
and thank you

658
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,344
Your spirit goes with Eywa

659
01:04:55,012 --> 01:04:56,722
Your body stays behind,

660
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:59,682
to become part of The People

661
01:05:03,478 --> 01:05:04,896
A clean kill.

662
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:09,735
You are ready.

663
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:38,764
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

664
01:05:38,889 --> 01:05:41,432
is the test every young hunter
has to pass

665
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:46,981
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are

666
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:49,023
Oo-rah

667
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:21,806
Now what?

668
01:07:51,813 --> 01:07:53,731
Jakesully will go first.

669
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,603
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside

670
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:34,480
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

671
01:08:34,606 --> 01:08:37,400
You will have one chance, Jake.

672
01:08:37,525 --> 01:08:39,612
How will I know if he chooses me?

673
01:08:39,737 --> 01:08:41,654
He will try to kill you.

674
01:08:42,864 --> 01:08:44,240
Outstanding.

675
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:45,927
Let's dance.

676
01:09:52,059 --> 01:09:53,894
That moron's going to die

677
01:10:17,835 --> 01:10:19,545
Don't be afraid, warrior

678
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,171
Make the bond!

679
01:10:24,632 --> 01:10:25,634
No!

680
01:10:29,637 --> 01:10:30,680
Jake!

681
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:46,322
Tsaheylu, Jake

682
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,949
Tsaheylu!

683
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,170
Stop!

684
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:14,934
Yeah, that's right.
You're mine. Huh?

685
01:11:28,197 --> 01:11:31,074
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

686
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:34,787
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

687
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,671
God damn!

688
01:11:49,092 --> 01:11:50,344
Oh, shit!

689
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:01,980
Shut up and fly straight!

690
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,534
That's it. Bank left!

691
01:12:23,918 --> 01:12:25,671
Level out! That's it.

692
01:12:31,176 --> 01:12:32,469
Jakesully!

693
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:58,328
Hey!

694
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:05,668
Let's go!

695
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,016
Yeah, baby, I got this!

696
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:22,101
Oh, shit!

697
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:31,153
I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this

698
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:33,113
Yeah!

699
01:13:34,113 --> 01:13:37,158
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

700
01:13:37,283 --> 01:13:42,247
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
- Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard--

701
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,311
The Tree of Souls

702
01:14:49,731 --> 01:14:51,900
It's their most sacred place.

703
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:55,529
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

704
01:14:55,654 --> 01:14:57,698
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

705
01:14:57,823 --> 01:15:02,328
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

706
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,788
I would die to get samples.

707
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:09,210
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

708
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:10,711
You lucky swine.

709
01:15:18,135 --> 01:15:21,846
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above

710
01:15:23,224 --> 01:15:26,185
Only problem is,
you're not the only one

711
01:15:30,104 --> 01:15:31,189
Dive!

712
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:55,130
Go, go!

713
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,640
Follow me!

714
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:53,689
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

715
01:16:54,606 --> 01:16:57,650
It is Toruk.
Last Shadow

716
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:02,488
Yeah, right.
It's the last one you ever see.

717
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:10,872
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto

718
01:17:11,582 --> 01:17:13,333
Rider of Last Shadow.

719
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:16,170
He rode this?

720
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,422
Toruk chose him

721
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,676
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

722
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:25,720
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

723
01:17:26,471 --> 01:17:28,349
Toruk Macto was mighty

724
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:33,938
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

725
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:36,356
All Na'vi people know the story.

726
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:47,243
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

727
01:17:48,409 --> 01:17:50,371
and in here is the dream

728
01:18:10,932 --> 01:18:13,601
It's hard to believe
it's only been three months

729
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:19,108
I can barely remember my old life

730
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:24,529
I don't know who I am anymore

731
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:46,092
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

732
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:52,224
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

733
01:18:54,475 --> 01:18:56,936
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

734
01:18:59,523 --> 01:19:02,025
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

735
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,944
No, I can do this.

736
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:05,654
You already have.

737
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:08,823
You give me good, usable intel.

738
01:19:08,948 --> 01:19:11,118
This Tree of Souls place.

739
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:14,954
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

740
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:16,789
which it will. Yeah.

741
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,710
Now it's time to come in.

742
01:19:21,212 --> 01:19:23,087
By the way,

743
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:25,591
you gonna get your legs back.

744
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:30,054
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

745
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:32,597
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

746
01:19:32,722 --> 01:19:34,475
I'm a man of my word.

747
01:19:37,394 --> 01:19:39,145
I gotta finish this.

748
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:42,983
There's one more thing.

749
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:48,655
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

750
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,284
If I do it, I'm one of them.

751
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:56,538
And they'll trust me.

752
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:03,378
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

753
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:19,520
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

754
01:20:36,953 --> 01:20:40,916
The Na 'vi say
that every person is born twice

755
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,381
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever

756
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,184
You are now a son
of the Omaticaya

757
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:02,645
You are part of The People

758
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:50,944
Come. Come.

759
01:22:08,587 --> 01:22:11,297
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

760
01:22:12,925 --> 01:22:14,801
And sometimes answered.

761
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:25,311
We call these trees
Utraya Mokri

762
01:22:26,354 --> 01:22:28,064
The Tree of Voices.

763
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:32,235
The voices of our ancestors.

764
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:48,836
I can hear them.

765
01:22:53,841 --> 01:22:55,384
They live, Jake,

766
01:22:57,511 --> 01:22:58,845
within Eywa.

767
01:23:03,057 --> 01:23:04,894
You are Omaticaya now.

768
01:23:05,685 --> 01:23:08,730
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

769
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:16,447
And you may choose a woman.

770
01:23:18,615 --> 01:23:20,533
We have many fine women.

771
01:23:21,784 --> 01:23:23,746
Ninat is the best singer.

772
01:23:26,664 --> 01:23:28,542
But I don't want Ninat.

773
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,797
Peyral is a good hunter.

774
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:38,551
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

775
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:42,389
I've already chosen.

776
01:23:45,935 --> 01:23:48,395
But this woman must also choose me.

777
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,025
She already has.

778
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,559
I am with you now, Jake.

779
01:24:28,143 --> 01:24:29,979
We are mated for life

780
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:38,362
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

781
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:09,976
Ma Jake!

782
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:11,311
Don't forget your phase integration.

783
01:25:11,436 --> 01:25:12,770
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

784
01:25:12,896 --> 01:25:14,731
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

785
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:28,162
Jake! Jake. Wake up!
Jake, please!

786
01:25:28,828 --> 01:25:31,289
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

787
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:34,001
Grace, I don't want--
Hey!

788
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:38,922
Jake!

789
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:48,974
Okay.

790
01:26:00,069 --> 01:26:02,070
Here. I'm done.
Let's go.

791
01:26:02,195 --> 01:26:04,405
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

792
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:06,533
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

793
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:11,956
Jake!

794
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:23,716
Jake! Wake up!
Jake! Wake up!

795
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,514
Hey!

796
01:26:29,265 --> 01:26:31,641
Stop! Stop!

797
01:26:31,766 --> 01:26:34,520
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

798
01:26:38,774 --> 01:26:40,067
Hey, boss.

799
01:26:40,568 --> 01:26:41,734
Hey!

800
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,405
- What?
- I got a native

801
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:48,408
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

802
01:26:48,533 --> 01:26:51,619
Well, keep going.
He'll move.

803
01:26:51,744 --> 01:26:54,957
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

804
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,502
Stop! Hey!

805
01:26:59,627 --> 01:27:01,921
Go! Go!

806
01:27:02,965 --> 01:27:04,341
There, see? He moved.

807
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:18,439
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude!
Dude, no!

808
01:27:19,398 --> 01:27:20,690
I'm blind.

809
01:27:32,578 --> 01:27:34,787
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

810
01:27:36,414 --> 01:27:38,042
Here, come on!

811
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:05,528
Freeze it right there.

812
01:28:07,154 --> 01:28:09,573
Scale up. Enhance.

813
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:12,743
Son of a bitch.

814
01:28:14,286 --> 01:28:15,703
Unbelievable.

815
01:28:16,831 --> 01:28:18,916
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

816
01:28:25,713 --> 01:28:28,007
Tsu'tey will lead the war party

817
01:28:34,556 --> 01:28:35,765
Stop please!

818
01:28:37,393 --> 01:28:39,353
This will only make it worse

819
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,188
You do not speak here!

820
01:28:42,398 --> 01:28:44,233
We will strike them in the heart

821
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:54,118
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

822
01:28:57,287 --> 01:28:58,788
- You!
- Listen. Brother--

823
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:07,422
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.

824
01:29:08,756 --> 01:29:10,676
Is this true?

825
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:15,389
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

826
01:29:16,806 --> 01:29:17,932
Brother, please.

827
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:21,811
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

828
01:29:21,936 --> 01:29:24,189
You are not my brother!

829
01:29:27,443 --> 01:29:29,153
And I am not your enemy!

830
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:33,657
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

831
01:29:35,951 --> 01:29:37,703
Go! Go! Go!

832
01:29:40,956 --> 01:29:43,375
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

833
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:44,835
Tsu'tey!

834
01:29:51,091 --> 01:29:53,969
I am Omaticaya.
I am one of you.

835
01:29:54,802 --> 01:29:57,014
And I have the right to speak.

836
01:30:01,601 --> 01:30:03,520
I have something to say

837
01:30:05,898 --> 01:30:07,399
to all of you

838
01:30:11,403 --> 01:30:13,447
The words are like stones in my heart.

839
01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:19,744
Sir, I'm sorry.
No, no, no! Hold on!

840
01:30:19,869 --> 01:30:22,081
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

841
01:30:23,289 --> 01:30:24,625
It's very dangerous!

842
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:28,378
Grace!

843
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:30,797
Oh, no.

844
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:33,007
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

845
01:30:34,551 --> 01:30:36,804
Okay. Look--

846
01:30:37,887 --> 01:30:39,180
I was sent here to--

847
01:30:42,851 --> 01:30:44,228
You see?

848
01:30:44,435 --> 01:30:47,021
It is a demon in a false body

849
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:10,171
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

850
01:31:13,631 --> 01:31:15,759
Wheel this meat out of here.

851
01:31:17,552 --> 01:31:20,055
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

852
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:25,060
You let me down, son.

853
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,314
So, what,

854
01:31:29,856 --> 01:31:31,817
you find yourself some local tail

855
01:31:31,942 --> 01:31:35,069
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

856
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:37,698
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

857
01:31:37,823 --> 01:31:40,283
- Parker--
- Shut your pie hole!

858
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:44,579
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

859
01:31:44,704 --> 01:31:47,416
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

860
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:50,252
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

861
01:31:50,377 --> 01:31:52,796
You say you want
to keep your people alive?

862
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:54,923
You start by listening to her.

863
01:31:55,048 --> 01:31:57,259
Those trees were sacred
to the Omaticaya

864
01:31:57,384 --> 01:31:59,136
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

865
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:01,514
You throw a stick in the air around here,

866
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:04,600
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

867
01:32:04,725 --> 01:32:06,018
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

868
01:32:06,143 --> 01:32:10,523
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

869
01:32:10,648 --> 01:32:13,274
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

870
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:14,818
Which is what, exactly?

871
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:17,195
What we think we know

872
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,658
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

873
01:32:20,783 --> 01:32:25,119
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

874
01:32:25,246 --> 01:32:29,792
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

875
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:33,087
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

876
01:32:34,003 --> 01:32:36,215
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

877
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,676
It's more connections
than the human brain.

878
01:32:39,885 --> 01:32:42,387
Get it? It's a network.

879
01:32:42,512 --> 01:32:45,474
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

880
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:49,060
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

881
01:32:49,185 --> 01:32:51,855
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

882
01:32:52,523 --> 01:32:53,524
Yes!

883
01:32:54,774 --> 01:32:58,863
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

884
01:32:59,529 --> 01:33:01,614
They're just goddamn trees!

885
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:06,078
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

886
01:33:06,203 --> 01:33:10,666
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

887
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:14,461
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

888
01:33:14,587 --> 01:33:18,841
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

889
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:23,595
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

890
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:27,807
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

891
01:33:27,932 --> 01:33:30,101
They're not gonna give up their home

892
01:33:31,936 --> 01:33:33,564
They're not gonna make a deal

893
01:33:34,648 --> 01:33:36,900
For what? Lite beer?

894
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:39,028
And blue jeans?

895
01:33:42,323 --> 01:33:45,201
There's nothing that we have
that they want

896
01:33:47,118 --> 01:33:50,122
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time

897
01:33:55,085 --> 01:33:56,962
They're never gonna leave Hometree

898
01:33:59,422 --> 01:34:05,386
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

899
01:34:05,595 --> 01:34:10,059
Jake, thanks.
I'm getting all emotional.

900
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:12,728
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

901
01:34:19,777 --> 01:34:23,113
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

902
01:34:24,073 --> 01:34:26,533
I'll drive them out with gas first.

903
01:34:27,784 --> 01:34:29,369
It'll be humane.

904
01:34:30,996 --> 01:34:32,413
More or less.

905
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:36,001
All right, let's pull the trigger.

906
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:41,548
- Come on, people.
- Oh, man.

907
01:34:41,673 --> 01:34:43,341
Let's pack it up, let's go.

908
01:34:43,466 --> 01:34:45,261
This is how it's done.

909
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:51,600
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

910
01:34:51,725 --> 01:34:55,729
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

911
01:34:55,854 --> 01:34:59,274
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

912
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:00,400
My God.

913
01:35:06,698 --> 01:35:10,869
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

914
01:35:10,994 --> 01:35:14,664
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to--

915
01:35:14,789 --> 01:35:15,832
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

916
01:35:15,957 --> 01:35:19,336
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

917
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:21,130
All right? Look around!

918
01:35:21,255 --> 01:35:24,925
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

919
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:26,467
- Can you guys just please--
- Yes, sir.

920
01:35:26,594 --> 01:35:29,054
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

921
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,430
Are you gonna kill children?

922
01:35:30,555 --> 01:35:34,435
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

923
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,895
Just let me try to talk them out.

924
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:39,189
They trust me.

925
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:44,904
Calibrate fast.
We're going in, right now.

926
01:35:45,029 --> 01:35:46,905
Calibrating three and four.

927
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:49,949
- Run sequence.
- Initiating. Thirty seconds.

928
01:35:54,371 --> 01:35:56,039
Listen to me.
You've got one hour.

929
01:35:56,164 --> 01:35:58,708
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

930
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:01,420
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

931
01:36:07,342 --> 01:36:08,551
Father!

932
01:36:08,761 --> 01:36:09,761
Mother!

933
01:36:09,929 --> 01:36:13,097
Eytukan, I have something to say

934
01:36:13,265 --> 01:36:14,516
Listen!

935
01:36:15,643 --> 01:36:17,101
Speak, Jakesully

936
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:21,524
A great evil is upon us

937
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:23,650
The Sky People are coming

938
01:36:23,984 --> 01:36:26,403
to destroy Hometree

939
01:36:28,905 --> 01:36:30,282
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

940
01:36:32,909 --> 01:36:35,621
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

941
01:36:35,746 --> 01:36:37,664
Are you certain of this?

942
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:45,130
Look, they sent me here
to learn your ways

943
01:36:46,381 --> 01:36:49,592
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

944
01:36:52,179 --> 01:36:55,765
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

945
01:36:59,019 --> 01:37:00,479
Yes.

946
01:37:00,604 --> 01:37:02,981
Look, at first it was just orders,

947
01:37:04,524 --> 01:37:06,819
and then everything changed.

948
01:37:06,944 --> 01:37:08,695
Okay? I fell in love.

949
01:37:09,363 --> 01:37:14,618
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

950
01:37:15,828 --> 01:37:17,246
And with you.

951
01:37:18,288 --> 01:37:20,082
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

952
01:37:20,207 --> 01:37:23,002
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.

953
01:37:30,426 --> 01:37:32,802
You will never be one of The People!

954
01:37:32,927 --> 01:37:34,680
- I shouldn't have--
- We tried to stop them!

955
01:37:34,805 --> 01:37:36,765
Neytiri, please! Please.

956
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:42,813
Bind them

957
01:37:44,606 --> 01:37:45,649
Leave now!

958
01:37:45,815 --> 01:37:49,110
You have to go.
They're coming!

959
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,168
Time on target, one mike

960
01:38:05,293 --> 01:38:07,212
Copy. We have a visual

961
01:38:07,337 --> 01:38:10,298
Roger that.
Stay on heading 030

962
01:38:10,423 --> 01:38:11,759
Roger, 030

963
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:27,565
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

964
01:38:29,234 --> 01:38:33,029
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!

965
01:38:36,867 --> 01:38:39,118
Run to the forest! Run!

966
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:42,832
Run! Run!

967
01:38:42,997 --> 01:38:46,543
Have no fear

968
01:39:03,394 --> 01:39:07,064
No! God damn it, run!

969
01:39:07,398 --> 01:39:08,774
Take the ikran,

970
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,400
attack from above

971
01:39:14,738 --> 01:39:16,865
That is one big damn tree.

972
01:39:24,414 --> 01:39:28,586
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

973
01:39:30,587 --> 01:39:32,672
All right, people,
let's get this done!

974
01:39:32,797 --> 01:39:35,592
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

975
01:39:35,717 --> 01:39:37,720
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

976
01:39:38,095 --> 01:39:39,262
- Fire.
- Firing.

977
01:39:50,774 --> 01:39:52,734
Bingo.
Mighty good shooting, ace.

978
01:40:00,743 --> 01:40:02,328
Sir, they've opened fire.

979
01:40:04,287 --> 01:40:05,956
You've got to be kidding me!

980
01:40:18,551 --> 01:40:21,055
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

981
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,805
All right, let's turn up the heat.

982
01:40:22,931 --> 01:40:25,809
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

983
01:40:25,935 --> 01:40:26,976
Fire

984
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:31,356
No!

985
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:46,329
Get everyone to the forest

986
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,961
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

987
01:40:55,713 --> 01:40:56,923
Neytiri!

988
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:08,644
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

989
01:41:08,769 --> 01:41:09,979
My God!

990
01:41:28,581 --> 01:41:31,917
- Mo'at! No!
- If you are one of us,

991
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,795
help us.

992
01:41:42,552 --> 01:41:44,512
All call signs, switch missiles.

993
01:41:44,721 --> 01:41:47,140
Give me HE's
at the base of the west columns

994
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,351
This way!

995
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,354
Rider section, switch missiles

996
01:41:53,479 --> 01:41:55,356
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up

997
01:41:55,481 --> 01:41:58,027
- Three's up.
- Yeah, baby, get some!

998
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:00,820
Charlie Oscar,
Gunrunner standing by

999
01:42:00,945 --> 01:42:02,280
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot

1000
01:42:09,412 --> 01:42:10,914
Come on, Grace, move!

1001
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:15,168
Down! Head down!

1002
01:42:17,755 --> 01:42:19,965
Come on, come on! Down!

1003
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:26,721
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target

1004
01:42:26,846 --> 01:42:28,015
Screw this.

1005
01:42:29,265 --> 01:42:31,226
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1006
01:42:31,351 --> 01:42:33,103
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1007
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,657
Repeat. Ripple fire

1008
01:43:28,283 --> 01:43:29,784
Go! Go! Go!

1009
01:44:02,902 --> 01:44:05,320
No, no, get back! Back!

1010
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:26,926
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1011
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:15,557
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1012
01:45:16,266 --> 01:45:17,518
Let's boogie.

1013
01:45:17,935 --> 01:45:20,311
Dragon coming left,
heading home

1014
01:45:20,813 --> 01:45:22,730
Gunrunner coming left

1015
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:25,317
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies

1016
01:45:33,033 --> 01:45:34,033
Father!

1017
01:45:50,009 --> 01:45:51,176
Daughter,

1018
01:45:52,427 --> 01:45:55,639
take my bow

1019
01:45:59,643 --> 01:46:04,064
Protect The People

1020
01:46:12,489 --> 01:46:13,657
Neytiri!

1021
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:27,462
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

1022
01:46:28,171 --> 01:46:29,381
Get away!

1023
01:46:30,507 --> 01:46:32,217
Get away from here!

1024
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,304
Never come back!

1025
01:46:53,029 --> 01:46:54,113
Pull the plug.

1026
01:46:55,114 --> 01:46:57,701
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

1027
01:46:57,827 --> 01:46:59,744
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

1028
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:18,514
I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace

1029
01:47:19,931 --> 01:47:23,810
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

1030
01:47:26,646 --> 01:47:28,064
Let's go!

1031
01:47:35,948 --> 01:47:37,533
Put him down!

1032
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:43,622
You murderer!

1033
01:48:30,293 --> 01:48:32,378
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1034
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:33,506
Hey.

1035
01:48:34,923 --> 01:48:37,592
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1036
01:48:37,717 --> 01:48:41,012
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

1037
01:48:42,096 --> 01:48:44,600
Yeah. You know what that is.
Down.

1038
01:48:44,725 --> 01:48:47,185
- Trudy!
- All the way down.

1039
01:48:50,648 --> 01:48:51,814
Max!

1040
01:49:01,908 --> 01:49:04,411
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1041
01:49:04,994 --> 01:49:06,079
Here.

1042
01:49:18,175 --> 01:49:20,594
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

1043
01:49:36,193 --> 01:49:40,072
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1044
01:49:40,197 --> 01:49:41,407
Okay. Go.

1045
01:49:55,253 --> 01:49:56,380
Clear.

1046
01:49:58,381 --> 01:49:59,591
Come on, baby.

1047
01:49:59,716 --> 01:50:02,469
Colonel? Sir?
I got a situation here.

1048
01:50:06,097 --> 01:50:09,100
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1049
01:50:12,188 --> 01:50:13,439
Three!

1050
01:50:16,317 --> 01:50:17,484
Come on!

1051
01:50:19,528 --> 01:50:20,820
Mask on!

1052
01:50:23,407 --> 01:50:25,201
Gas, gas, gas!

1053
01:50:26,868 --> 01:50:28,871
I'm taking fire!
Let's go!

1054
01:50:31,372 --> 01:50:34,502
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1055
01:50:35,502 --> 01:50:37,296
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go!

1056
01:50:49,975 --> 01:50:51,268
Colonel!

1057
01:50:58,067 --> 01:51:01,529
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

1058
01:51:04,782 --> 01:51:07,408
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

1059
01:51:07,534 --> 01:51:08,993
Oh, yeah, baby!

1060
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:10,954
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

1061
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:14,166
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1062
01:51:14,457 --> 01:51:16,210
- Grace is hit!
- What?

1063
01:51:17,418 --> 01:51:18,962
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

1064
01:51:19,087 --> 01:51:22,550
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1065
01:51:22,675 --> 01:51:27,095
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1066
01:51:30,474 --> 01:51:32,893
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!

1067
01:51:34,103 --> 01:51:35,895
Hold on.
I'm pulling pitch

1068
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:41,777
You're clear!

1069
01:51:49,743 --> 01:51:52,453
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1070
01:51:52,579 --> 01:51:53,956
Copy that

1071
01:52:00,962 --> 01:52:04,257
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep! Still here

1072
01:52:06,135 --> 01:52:10,764
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1073
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,932
It's strongest
at the Tree of Souls, right?

1074
01:52:13,057 --> 01:52:14,475
Yeah

1075
01:52:14,601 --> 01:52:16,520
Good. 'Cause that's
where we're going.

1076
01:52:25,404 --> 01:52:26,529
Ouch.

1077
01:52:29,992 --> 01:52:31,368
You big baby.

1078
01:52:32,744 --> 01:52:34,162
We're moving.

1079
01:52:34,747 --> 01:52:36,789
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1080
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:39,877
I'm a scientist, remember?

1081
01:52:40,836 --> 01:52:43,255
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1082
01:52:44,131 --> 01:52:46,007
The People can help you.

1083
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:47,801
I know it.

1084
01:52:49,802 --> 01:52:51,639
Why would they help us?

1085
01:53:07,695 --> 01:53:10,783
The People say Eywa will provide

1086
01:53:12,743 --> 01:53:15,412
With no home, no hope,

1087
01:53:16,538 --> 01:53:18,666
there was only one place they could go

1088
01:53:33,096 --> 01:53:34,265
Link's running.

1089
01:53:35,015 --> 01:53:37,976
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

1090
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:43,690
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place

1091
01:53:44,733 --> 01:53:46,068
I gotta try.

1092
01:53:48,863 --> 01:53:50,155
Launching.

1093
01:54:11,676 --> 01:54:12,886
Outcast

1094
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,889
Betrayer

1095
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:17,140
Alien

1096
01:54:18,725 --> 01:54:21,395
I was in the place
the eye does not see

1097
01:54:32,614 --> 01:54:36,452
I needed their help,
and they needed mine

1098
01:54:37,411 --> 01:54:39,371
But to ever face them again,

1099
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:41,916
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level

1100
01:54:50,507 --> 01:54:53,801
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move

1101
01:54:56,596 --> 01:54:58,932
There's something we gotta do.

1102
01:54:59,057 --> 01:55:00,725
You're not gonna like it.

1103
01:55:10,778 --> 01:55:14,573
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky

1104
01:55:14,698 --> 01:55:16,283
Nothing attacks him

1105
01:55:16,826 --> 01:55:18,118
Easy, boy.

1106
01:55:18,618 --> 01:55:20,412
So why would he ever look up?

1107
01:55:21,579 --> 01:55:23,164
But that was just a theory

1108
01:56:33,903 --> 01:56:35,488
Toruk Macto?

1109
01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:16,779
I see you.

1110
01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:21,199
I see you.

1111
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:31,210
I was afraid, Jake.

1112
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:34,128
For my people.

1113
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:38,801
I'm not anymore.

1114
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,563
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo,

1115
01:57:51,313 --> 01:57:53,189
I stand before you

1116
01:57:54,315 --> 01:57:57,360
ready to serve
the Omaticaya people

1117
01:58:00,029 --> 01:58:04,243
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior

1118
01:58:05,452 --> 01:58:07,579
I can't do this without you.

1119
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,046
Toruk Macto,

1120
01:58:23,929 --> 01:58:25,639
I will fly with you.

1121
01:58:28,975 --> 01:58:30,685
My friend is dying.

1122
01:58:33,104 --> 01:58:34,606
Grace is dying.

1123
01:58:36,649 --> 01:58:38,485
I beg the help of Eywa.

1124
01:58:50,413 --> 01:58:52,373
Look where we are, Grace.

1125
01:58:59,131 --> 01:59:01,466
I need to take some samples.

1126
01:59:24,948 --> 01:59:28,993
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1127
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,663
in this body.

1128
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:35,876
Is that possible?

1129
01:59:36,001 --> 01:59:40,463
She must pass through
the eye of Eywa and return.

1130
01:59:41,756 --> 01:59:43,259
But, Jakesully,

1131
01:59:44,301 --> 01:59:45,886
she is very weak.

1132
01:59:47,387 --> 01:59:50,181
Hang on, Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

1133
01:59:53,476 --> 01:59:56,020
Hear us please, All Mother

1134
01:59:56,646 --> 01:59:58,858
Eywa, help her

1135
01:59:59,649 --> 02:00:01,777
Take this spirit into you

1136
02:00:05,447 --> 02:00:07,533
and breathe her back to us

1137
02:00:11,453 --> 02:00:13,037
Let her walk among us

1138
02:00:15,623 --> 02:00:17,501
as one of The People

1139
02:00:46,447 --> 02:00:47,489
Jake.

1140
02:00:49,949 --> 02:00:51,076
Grace.

1141
02:00:53,244 --> 02:00:54,913
I'm with her, Jake.

1142
02:00:56,957 --> 02:00:58,292
She's real!

1143
02:01:01,377 --> 02:01:04,506
Grace? Grace, please.
Grace!

1144
02:01:05,716 --> 02:01:07,301
What's happening?

1145
02:01:08,301 --> 02:01:09,929
What's happening?

1146
02:01:14,307 --> 02:01:15,434
Grace!

1147
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:17,310
Grace!

1148
02:01:19,438 --> 02:01:21,023
What's happening?

1149
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,697
Did it work?

1150
02:01:34,411 --> 02:01:38,457
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1151
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:41,877
She is with Eywa now.

1152
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:18,329
With your permission,
I will speak now.

1153
02:02:20,748 --> 02:02:23,168
You would honor me by translating.

1154
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:32,469
The Sky People have sent us a message,

1155
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:38,266
that they can take
whatever they want,

1156
02:02:40,101 --> 02:02:41,854
and no one can stop them.

1157
02:02:45,483 --> 02:02:47,234
Well, we will send them a message.

1158
02:02:49,904 --> 02:02:52,198
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1159
02:02:55,533 --> 02:02:57,869
You tell the other clans to come.

1160
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:03,501
You tell them
Toruk Macto calls to them

1161
02:03:05,752 --> 02:03:08,506
And you fly now with me!

1162
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:12,051
My brothers! Sisters!

1163
02:03:13,176 --> 02:03:15,220
And we will show the Sky People

1164
02:03:16,262 --> 02:03:18,097
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1165
02:03:19,641 --> 02:03:21,060
and that this,

1166
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:22,810
this is our land!

1167
02:04:36,217 --> 02:04:37,677
We rode out to the four winds

1168
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:42,850
To the horse clans of the plain

1169
02:04:45,853 --> 02:04:46,854
Back to the stars!

1170
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:49,148
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea

1171
02:04:49,273 --> 02:04:50,483
For our children's children!

1172
02:04:50,608 --> 02:04:53,152
When Toruk Macto called them,
they came

1173
02:05:34,568 --> 02:05:37,029
Everyone on this base,
every one of you,

1174
02:05:37,154 --> 02:05:38,948
is fighting for survival.

1175
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:40,533
That's a fact!

1176
02:05:41,408 --> 02:05:45,119
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1177
02:05:46,247 --> 02:05:50,083
Now, these orbital images tell me

1178
02:05:50,542 --> 02:05:53,712
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1179
02:05:53,837 --> 02:05:56,340
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1180
02:05:56,923 --> 02:05:58,884
And more are pouring in.

1181
02:06:01,386 --> 02:06:04,765
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1182
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,184
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1183
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:09,478
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1184
02:06:11,104 --> 02:06:14,692
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1185
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:17,153
We will fight terror with terror.

1186
02:06:21,489 --> 02:06:25,618
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1187
02:06:25,743 --> 02:06:28,079
is protected by their--

1188
02:06:28,204 --> 02:06:29,539
Their deity.

1189
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,917
And when we destroy it,

1190
02:06:33,042 --> 02:06:35,337
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1191
02:06:35,462 --> 02:06:38,923
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks
of this place ever again.

1192
02:06:39,048 --> 02:06:41,719
And that, too, is a fact.

1193
02:06:42,469 --> 02:06:44,180
Yeah! Yeah.

1194
02:06:54,689 --> 02:06:58,610
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber

1195
02:06:58,735 --> 02:07:00,945
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives

1196
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:03,948
It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign

1197
02:07:04,073 --> 02:07:05,951
Fricking daisy cutters!

1198
02:07:07,494 --> 02:07:10,288
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him

1199
02:07:10,413 --> 02:07:12,457
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow

1200
02:07:12,582 --> 02:07:14,417
- Max! Max!
- I gotta go

1201
02:07:16,337 --> 02:07:17,796
We're screwed!

1202
02:07:19,297 --> 02:07:21,466
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1203
02:07:21,591 --> 02:07:23,761
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1204
02:07:25,261 --> 02:07:28,599
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1205
02:07:31,644 --> 02:07:33,645
I have 15 clans out there.

1206
02:07:34,354 --> 02:07:36,439
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1207
02:07:37,983 --> 02:07:42,404
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1208
02:07:43,488 --> 02:07:47,493
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

1209
02:07:48,034 --> 02:07:49,494
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1210
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:53,832
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

1211
02:07:55,751 --> 02:07:59,171
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1212
02:07:59,296 --> 02:08:00,463
Yeah, I know.

1213
02:08:00,588 --> 02:08:03,050
If they get to the Tree of Souls,
it's over.

1214
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:06,345
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1215
02:08:07,179 --> 02:08:09,139
It'll destroy them.

1216
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:11,641
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1217
02:08:26,739 --> 02:08:29,702
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1218
02:08:32,162 --> 02:08:36,876
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1219
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:43,841
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1220
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:47,219
See the world we come from.

1221
02:08:48,345 --> 02:08:50,221
There's no green there.

1222
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:53,600
They killed their Mother.

1223
02:08:54,435 --> 02:08:56,895
And they're gonna do the same here.

1224
02:08:58,564 --> 02:09:01,108
More Sky People are gonna come.

1225
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:04,235
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1226
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:07,280
Unless we stop them.

1227
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:12,953
Look, you chose me for something.

1228
02:09:14,454 --> 02:09:16,289
I will stand and fight.

1229
02:09:17,373 --> 02:09:18,917
You know I will.

1230
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,671
But I need a little help here.

1231
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:32,847
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1232
02:09:34,682 --> 02:09:38,103
She protects only the balance of life.

1233
02:09:49,948 --> 02:09:51,617
It was worth a try.

1234
02:10:22,355 --> 02:10:24,315
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1235
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:27,735
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1236
02:10:39,873 --> 02:10:43,210
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex

1237
02:10:43,627 --> 02:10:47,172
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode

1238
02:11:22,123 --> 02:11:23,958
This is Papa Dragon.

1239
02:11:24,083 --> 02:11:27,128
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1240
02:11:34,677 --> 02:11:38,390
- Suit Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1241
02:11:48,984 --> 02:11:50,569
Move, move, move!

1242
02:11:56,242 --> 02:11:57,993
Bravo 1-1, move left

1243
02:11:58,577 --> 02:12:01,956
Bravo 1-1 moving left.
Watch flank

1244
02:12:04,332 --> 02:12:07,877
- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that

1245
02:12:08,002 --> 02:12:10,338
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing

1246
02:12:10,463 --> 02:12:11,756
Copy that. Over

1247
02:12:11,881 --> 02:12:16,511
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1248
02:12:17,136 --> 02:12:20,431
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target

1249
02:12:20,557 --> 02:12:22,935
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle

1250
02:12:28,064 --> 02:12:30,568
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1251
02:12:31,569 --> 02:12:34,154
Gun crews,
keep your head on a swivel

1252
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:37,198
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there

1253
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:42,037
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

1254
02:12:42,162 --> 02:12:44,331
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1255
02:12:44,497 --> 02:12:46,958
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1256
02:12:47,792 --> 02:12:49,962
Roll it to the ramp!
Let's go!

1257
02:12:52,256 --> 02:12:53,298
Hold!

1258
02:13:01,347 --> 02:13:03,350
Charlie 2-1, got big movement

1259
02:13:03,475 --> 02:13:04,851
- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up

1260
02:13:04,976 --> 02:13:09,105
- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position

1261
02:13:15,237 --> 02:13:18,157
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1262
02:13:18,282 --> 02:13:20,783
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!

1263
02:13:21,202 --> 02:13:23,871
Targets closing.
Range, 400 meters

1264
02:13:24,622 --> 02:13:27,332
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir. It's the Flux.

1265
02:13:55,653 --> 02:13:58,279
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1266
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:42,783
All aircraft, weapons free!
Weapons free!

1267
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:45,118
Break right. Come around.

1268
02:14:48,706 --> 02:14:50,166
Light them up!

1269
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:00,009
Break formation,
engage all hostiles.

1270
02:15:07,307 --> 02:15:09,143
Yeah! Get some!

1271
02:15:48,181 --> 02:15:49,975
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1272
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:02,613
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1273
02:16:03,322 --> 02:16:05,990
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1274
02:16:06,115 --> 02:16:07,117
Copy. Get out of there.

1275
02:16:12,206 --> 02:16:13,582
That's him. Get after him!

1276
02:16:30,557 --> 02:16:32,016
Take him out!

1277
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:41,777
Light her up!

1278
02:16:50,827 --> 02:16:52,203
Right there!

1279
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:54,582
You're not the only one
with a gun, bitch.

1280
02:16:54,873 --> 02:16:56,500
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

1281
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:57,626
Arming all pods.

1282
02:17:03,381 --> 02:17:04,424
That's it!

1283
02:17:35,121 --> 02:17:36,207
Seze!

1284
02:18:40,186 --> 02:18:42,355
Rogue One is hit.
I'm going in

1285
02:18:43,273 --> 02:18:44,649
Sorry, Jake.

1286
02:18:53,533 --> 02:18:54,576
Fire.

1287
02:19:12,719 --> 02:19:15,181
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1288
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:19,684
Rogue One, you copy?

1289
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,854
Trudy!

1290
02:19:33,781 --> 02:19:35,033
Time to target, two minutes.

1291
02:19:35,408 --> 02:19:37,786
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1292
02:19:37,912 --> 02:19:40,039
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1293
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,715
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

1294
02:19:51,174 --> 02:19:52,343
Ma Jake!

1295
02:19:54,302 --> 02:19:55,429
I read you.

1296
02:20:04,604 --> 02:20:06,565
- Neytiri!
- Seze's dead

1297
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:09,652
They are very close.
They are many.

1298
02:20:11,111 --> 02:20:12,570
Do not attack.

1299
02:20:13,197 --> 02:20:15,114
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1300
02:20:17,743 --> 02:20:18,994
Do not attack!

1301
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:22,497
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

1302
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:31,799
Neytiri!

1303
02:20:33,925 --> 02:20:35,802
I got movement, I got movement

1304
02:20:35,927 --> 02:20:38,138
Hold position.
Something's coming.

1305
02:20:38,263 --> 02:20:40,014
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over

1306
02:20:40,139 --> 02:20:42,268
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation

1307
02:20:42,393 --> 02:20:44,060
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks

1308
02:20:49,233 --> 02:20:50,692
Hundred meters and closing fast

1309
02:21:07,292 --> 02:21:09,253
We gotta get out of here!

1310
02:21:10,796 --> 02:21:12,463
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! Move! Move!

1311
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:14,967
Fall back!
On the run! On the run!

1312
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:24,809
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1313
02:21:31,691 --> 02:21:33,443
Eywa has heard you!

1314
02:21:44,038 --> 02:21:45,414
Come on!

1315
02:21:57,718 --> 02:21:59,552
Fall back! Move! Move!

1316
02:22:24,077 --> 02:22:26,664
Sir! All escorts are down
or falling back.

1317
02:22:26,789 --> 02:22:30,876
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1318
02:22:31,001 --> 02:22:33,837
- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing to target

1319
02:22:33,962 --> 02:22:35,923
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1320
02:22:55,775 --> 02:22:58,194
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1321
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:00,989
Drop! Drop! Drop!
Go, go, go, go!

1322
02:23:34,772 --> 02:23:35,899
Brace!

1323
02:23:52,958 --> 02:23:54,251
It's Sully.

1324
02:24:08,014 --> 02:24:10,266
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

1325
02:26:47,466 --> 02:26:49,300
Come on. Come to papa.

1326
02:27:16,828 --> 02:27:18,581
Give it up, Quaritch!

1327
02:27:21,666 --> 02:27:23,127
It's all over.

1328
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,838
Nothing's over while I'm breathing

1329
02:27:26,963 --> 02:27:29,216
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1330
02:28:25,397 --> 02:28:26,565
Come on!

1331
02:28:42,497 --> 02:28:46,543
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1332
02:28:51,256 --> 02:28:53,384
You think you're one of them?

1333
02:28:54,676 --> 02:28:56,262
Time to wake up.

1334
02:30:40,532 --> 02:30:41,533
Jake?

1335
02:30:55,297 --> 02:30:56,340
Jake.

1336
02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:15,734
Jake.

1337
02:31:31,834 --> 02:31:33,793
Jake! Ma Jake!

1338
02:32:15,460 --> 02:32:16,754
I see you.

1339
02:32:22,468 --> 02:32:23,761
I see you.

1340
02:32:35,397 --> 02:32:38,191
The aliens went back
to their dying world

1341
02:32:40,402 --> 02:32:43,280
Only a few were chosen to stay

1342
02:32:55,501 --> 02:32:57,961
The time of great sorrow was ending

1343
02:33:00,088 --> 02:33:02,466
Toruk Macto was no longer needed

1344
02:33:15,020 --> 02:33:18,898
Well, I guess this is
my last video log

1345
02:33:20,775 --> 02:33:24,530
'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm--

1346
02:33:25,613 --> 02:33:28,408
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place

1347
02:33:32,037 --> 02:33:34,165
Well, I guess I'd better go

1348
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:39,795
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party

1349
02:33:43,174 --> 02:33:45,550
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all

1350
02:33:48,137 --> 02:33:50,388
This is Jake Sully signing off

1351
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,991
When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,

1352
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:44,994
with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,

1353
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,289
I started having these dreams of flying

1354
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,125
I was free

1355
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,966
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

1356
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,277
In cryo, you don't dream at all

1357
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:19,320
It doesn't feel like six years

1358
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:21,823
More like a fifth of teguila
and an ass-kicking

1359
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,206
Tommy was the scientist, not me

1360
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,502
He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space

1361
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,878
to find the answers

1362
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,381
Are we there yet?

1363
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,258
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

1364
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,384
We're there.

1365
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,927
It's about your brother

1366
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:49,393
So, a week before
Tommy's gonna ship out,

1367
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:53,188
a guy with a gun ends his journey
for the paper in his wallet

1368
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:58,359
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

1369
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,362
You will be hungry.
You will be weak.

1370
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:04,033
If you feel nausea,
please use the sacks--

1371
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,117
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist

1372
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:09,413
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret

1373
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,304
Up ahead was Pandora

1374
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:30,683
You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there

1375
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:44,114
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

1376
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,033
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

1377
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:51,663
And since your genome is identical to his,
you could step into his shoes,

1378
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,582
so to speak.

1379
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,550
It'd be a fresh start
on a new world

1380
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,893
And the pay is good

1381
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,478
Very good.

1382
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,795
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

1383
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,213
Remember, people,
you lose that mask,

1384
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,968
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

1385
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,388
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

1386
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,850
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

1387
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:55,728
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.

1388
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,266
One life ends,

1389
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,478
another begins

1390
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:47,237
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!

1391
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:50,783
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

1392
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:54,870
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

1393
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,540
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

1394
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,882
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

1395
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,764
There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine

1396
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,810
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude

1397
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,939
I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass

1398
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:30,781
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

1399
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,576
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy

1400
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,413
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

1401
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,206
Well, well, ladies.

1402
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,502
Look at all this fresh meat!

1403
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:53,428
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

1404
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,014
fighting for freedom

1405
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,271
Look out, hot rod!

1406
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,608
But out here they're just hired guns,

1407
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,528
taking the money,
working for the company

1408
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:10,987
Check this out, man.

1409
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,115
Meals on wheels.

1410
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,327
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

1411
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,245
I got two guys free
in about 20 minutes!

1412
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,872
Got it! Need them!

1413
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,425
You're not in Kansas anymore

1414
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:38,766
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

1415
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,603
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

1416
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,481
If there is a hell,

1417
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,862
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

1418
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:54,865
Out there, beyond that fence,

1419
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,286
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

1420
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:02,540
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

1421
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:09,213
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

1422
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:11,632
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

1423
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:14,509
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

1424
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,930
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

1425
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,391
They are very hard to kill.

1426
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:26,855
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

1427
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,567
I will not succeed.

1428
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,153
Not with all of you.

1429
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,283
If you wish to survive,

1430
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:40,244
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

1431
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:43,247
You've got to obey the rules.

1432
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,040
Pandora rules.

1433
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,002
Rule number one--

1434
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,754
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

1435
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,548
to put your mind at ease

1436
00:07:54,925 --> 00:08:00,430
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

1437
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,350
Wow! You look just like him.

1438
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:07,187
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

1439
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,273
...into the bio-lab.

1440
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:14,528
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

1441
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:15,862
- Hi.
- Hey.

1442
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,531
Link-- Here's the link room right here.

1443
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,908
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

1444
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,786
Me and Norm are here to drive

1445
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:27,040
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars

1446
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:32,129
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives

1447
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,173
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

1448
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,634
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

1449
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:40,511
Damn! They got big.

1450
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:43,139
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

1451
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,558
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

1452
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,519
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

1453
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:49,480
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

1454
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,481
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

1455
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,359
There's yours.

1456
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,653
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

1457
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,615
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

1458
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,014
Looks like him.

1459
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,101
No, it looks like you.

1460
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:31,145
This is your avatar now, Jake.

1461
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,778
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

1462
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,657
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

1463
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,493
or something

1464
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,249
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

1465
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:53,168
which is insanely expensive

1466
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,380
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

1467
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,633
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

1468
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,759
You know, what we see, what we feel.

1469
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:04,554
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

1470
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,057
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

1471
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:09,934
All right. Whatever.

1472
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,563
So--

1473
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,066
Well, here I am,

1474
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,235
doing science.

1475
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,989
They're coming out!

1476
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,575
Attention.
Drivers coming out of link

1477
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:33,250
Oh, God.

1478
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,879
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

1479
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:43,302
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

1480
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,847
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

1481
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,433
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

1482
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:53,269
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

1483
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,605
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

1484
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,982
Here she is,
Cinderella back from the ball.

1485
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,778
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

1486
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:07,243
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

1487
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,495
May the All Mother

1488
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,664
smile upon our first meeting

1489
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,960
Not bad.
You sound a little formal

1490
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,337
I studied for five years

1491
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,506
but there is much to learn

1492
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:25,219
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

1493
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:29,807
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

1494
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:33,519
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

1495
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,019
He's dead.

1496
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,065
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

1497
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,485
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

1498
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,073
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

1499
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,493
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

1500
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:50,827
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

1501
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,496
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

1502
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,999
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

1503
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,960
He has no business sticking his nose
in my department.

1504
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:02,798
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

1505
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,019
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

1506
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:17,937
Hover taxi, Delta runway.
Squawk ident.

1507
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,070
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

1508
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,239
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

1509
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,241
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

1510
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,332
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

1511
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,376
but now I see that
you're intentionally screwing me.

1512
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:44,005
Grace, you know,
I enjoy our little talks.

1513
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:51,846
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

1514
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,599
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

1515
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,183
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

1516
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,269
How is this in any way lucky?

1517
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,104
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

1518
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,106
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

1519
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,109
A Marine we can use.

1520
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,070
I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.

1521
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:09,615
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

1522
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,575
Look, look, you're supposed
to be winning the hearts

1523
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,701
and the minds of the natives.

1524
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,620
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

1525
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,205
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

1526
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,956
then they'll start trusting us.

1527
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,042
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

1528
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,126
but after, what, how many years?

1529
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:23,754
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

1530
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,091
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

1531
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,301
Right. Come here.

1532
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,136
I can't-- I can't--

1533
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,309
This is why we're here.
Unobtanium.

1534
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,480
Because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

1535
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:44,817
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

1536
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,777
It's what pays for your science.

1537
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,282
Now, those savages are threatening
our whole operation,

1538
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:52,615
we're on the brink of war,

1539
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,911
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

1540
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,498
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

1541
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,927
So, how much link time have you logged?

1542
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,639
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

1543
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:21,061
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

1544
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,813
Zip. But I read a manual.

1545
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,817
Tell me you're joking.

1546
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,528
This is cool.

1547
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,404
Let's go.

1548
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:37,036
Don't. I got this.

1549
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:44,000
So you just figured
you'd come out here,

1550
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,711
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

1551
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:50,548
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

1552
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,927
What was going through your head?

1553
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:55,846
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

1554
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:59,225
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

1555
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,979
Keep your arms in,
hands in, head down.

1556
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:08,900
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

1557
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,486
That shouldn't be hard for you.

1558
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,404
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white--

1559
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:14,907
Initiate link.

1560
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,201
Run sequence unit three. Go.

1561
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:19,745
Launching.

1562
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,626
I have the first congruency.

1563
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:40,557
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

1564
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,600
Phase-lock 40%.

1565
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,148
All right. Going in.

1566
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:50,359
I'm going in in four.

1567
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,030
Phase-lock 99%.
Link is stable.

1568
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:16,759
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

1569
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,428
Pupillary reflex is good

1570
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:24,225
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

1571
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:26,312
Hey, guys.

1572
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,938
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

1573
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:30,399
Good!

1574
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,984
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

1575
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,153
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

1576
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,653
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

1577
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,322
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

1578
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,533
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

1579
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:40,909
- that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

1580
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,995
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

1581
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,540
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

1582
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:49,375
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

1583
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,005
Distal motor control is good.
Good, Jake.

1584
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,716
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

1585
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,345
That's great, Jake.
Hold on, now.

1586
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,679
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

1587
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,307
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

1588
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:06,477
- so take it easy.
- Wait.

1589
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,019
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

1590
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,521
Jake! Listen to me.
Jake!

1591
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,857
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

1592
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:14,692
- Buddy, listen to me.
- It's all good. I got this.

1593
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:18,446
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

1594
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,657
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

1595
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,536
You need time to adjust to the avatar--
Whoa! Jake!

1596
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,871
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

1597
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:30,041
Sedate! Sedate him!
A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

1598
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,419
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

1599
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,546
By the numbers

1600
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,047
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me

1601
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,714
You're not used to your avatar body.

1602
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,467
- This is dangerous.
- This is great

1603
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,804
- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're gonna put you out

1604
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,058
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

1605
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,727
God damn it!
Bring them home!

1606
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:51,438
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

1607
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:57,068
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

1608
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:58,737
I don't even have to play defense on it.

1609
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,280
Hey, guys. Hey.

1610
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,657
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!

1611
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,535
Jake! Jake!
Excuse me.

1612
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:08,705
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

1613
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,249
Come on!

1614
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,211
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

1615
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,140
- Jeez! Sorry.
- Watch it!

1616
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:49,954
Hey, Marine!

1617
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,165
Damn.

1618
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,378
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

1619
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,132
Think fast.

1620
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,176
Motor controI's looking good.

1621
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:17,357
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

1622
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,567
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

1623
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,111
Hey, hey, hey!

1624
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,864
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

1625
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:25,406
That's kind of freaky.

1626
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,951
Come on. Scat.

1627
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,328
Good night.

1628
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,166
Lights out!
See you at dinner, kiddies.

1629
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,233
Welcome back.

1630
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,536
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1631
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

1632
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,752
Hold on a second.

1633
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,173
Hey, Wainfleet!
Get it done!

1634
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:27,760
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

1635
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,431
Vine strike's still loose.

1636
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,682
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

1637
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,101
Watch it!

1638
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:37,438
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

1639
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,189
Or the biggest.

1640
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:42,108
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

1641
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,986
I thought you'd never ask.

1642
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:48,490
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

1643
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,628
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

1644
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:04,298
This low gravity'll make you soft.

1645
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,300
You get soft,

1646
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:13,807
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

1647
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,478
I pulled your record, Corporal.

1648
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,980
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

1649
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,234
Nothing like this here, though.

1650
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:29,865
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

1651
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,825
I figured it's just another hellhole.

1652
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:34,327
I was First Recon myself.

1653
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:37,664
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

1654
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,501
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

1655
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,045
I come out here?

1656
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:47,132
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail louie?

1657
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:51,761
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

1658
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,518
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

1659
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,479
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

1660
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:08,362
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

1661
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:15,411
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

1662
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,162
- Clear!
- Clear!

1663
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:27,463
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

1664
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,215
Give me the goose bumps.

1665
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,720
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

1666
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,512
right on the ground.

1667
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:37,724
Right in the hostiles' camp.

1668
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,855
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

1669
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,607
I want you to gain their trust.

1670
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,442
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

1671
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,069
or hammer them hard if they won't.

1672
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,781
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

1673
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:57,994
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

1674
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:01,080
but you report to me.

1675
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,292
Can you do that for me, son?

1676
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,253
Hell, yeah, sir.

1677
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,923
Well, all right, then.

1678
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,854
Son, I take care of my own.

1679
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:25,064
You get me what I need,

1680
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:28,400
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

1681
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:30,778
Your real legs.

1682
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,532
That sounds real good, sir.

1683
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:44,916
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

1684
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:48,628
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

1685
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:52,258
I have five congruencies.
Phase-lock 90%.

1686
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,634
Link three ready.

1687
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:55,970
All right, I'm going in.

1688
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,375
Shut it down.
We're gonna stay a while.

1689
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:15,590
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

1690
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:22,222
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

1691
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,352
You the man, Doc.

1692
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:06,016
Prolemuris.
They're not aggressive.

1693
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:12,105
Relax, Marine.
You're making me nervous.

1694
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:20,280
So, how will they know we're here?

1695
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:23,032
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

1696
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,453
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

1697
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:33,460
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

1698
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,048
Wow! It's that fast?

1699
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,386
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1700
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:47,266
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

1701
00:26:47,391 --> 00:26:50,978
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

1702
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,730
Okay. Sample.

1703
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,986
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

1704
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:03,615
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

1705
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,826
Right.

1706
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,522
So, here I go.

1707
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:04,843
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

1708
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:10,182
It's already pissed off.

1709
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:13,269
Jake, that armor's too thick.
Trust me.

1710
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:23,237
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

1711
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,614
So, what do I do,
dance with it?

1712
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:29,159
Just hold your ground.

1713
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,634
Yeah? Come on!
What you got?

1714
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:49,762
Oh, yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

1715
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:53,142
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, bitch.

1716
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:57,270
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

1717
00:28:57,395 --> 00:29:00,273
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

1718
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,359
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

1719
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:07,615
Oh, shit.

1720
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,878
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

1721
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,340
Run! Definitely run!

1722
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,152
I'm gonna have to call it, guys

1723
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,113
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

1724
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:21,117
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have
to hang on till morning

1725
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:22,786
He won't make it till morning.

1726
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,650
I don't have all goddamn night.

1727
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,612
Come on! Come on!

1728
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:36,188
Hey, wait. Don't!

1729
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:40,818
Great.

1730
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:41,836
Look, I know you probably
don't understand this,

1731
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,135
but thank you.

1732
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:55,726
Thank you.

1733
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,190
That was pretty impressive.

1734
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:06,862
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was--

1735
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,536
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, where you going?

1736
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:15,996
Wait up!

1737
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:18,541
Just-- Hey, slow down.

1738
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,668
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

1739
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,838
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

1740
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:29,092
You don't thank for this.

1741
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,597
This is sad.
Very sad only.

1742
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:37,643
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

1743
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,271
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

1744
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:46,943
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

1745
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,864
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

1746
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,614
Your fault!

1747
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:54,827
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

1748
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:58,581
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

1749
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,123
Easy.

1750
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:04,795
Fine. Fine.

1751
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,090
If you love your little forest friends,

1752
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,510
why not let them just kill my ass?

1753
00:39:12,552 --> 00:39:14,262
What's the thinking?

1754
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,766
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

1755
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:24,190
You have a strong heart.

1756
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,525
No fear.

1757
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,909
But stupid!
Ignorant like a child.

1758
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:43,751
Well, if I'm like a child, then--

1759
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,586
Look, maybe you should teach me.

1760
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:48,922
Sky People cannot learn.
You do not see.

1761
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:50,840
Well, then teach me how to see.

1762
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:53,427
- No one can teach you to see.
- Whoa.

1763
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:57,222
Look, come on,
can't we talk?

1764
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:02,061
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

1765
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:08,608
You're like a baby.

1766
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,407
I need your help.

1767
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:19,327
You should not be here.

1768
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:23,123
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

1769
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:26,835
No.

1770
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,547
Go back.

1771
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,193
No!

1772
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:15,175
What--

1773
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:20,472
What are they?

1774
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,809
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

1775
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:26,519
Very pure spirits.

1776
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:52,545
What was that all about?

1777
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:55,757
Come.

1778
00:41:57,259 --> 00:41:58,302
Come!

1779
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,222
Where are we going?

1780
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,525
Come.

1781
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:19,907
What's your name?

1782
00:42:20,032 --> 00:42:21,074
Shit!

1783
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,643
Okay.

1784
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:53,190
Calm people, calm

1785
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:01,739
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

1786
00:43:04,242 --> 00:43:07,079
These demons are forbidden here

1787
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:10,206
There has been a sign

1788
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:12,626
This is a matter for the Tsahik

1789
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:18,423
Bring him

1790
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,635
What's going on?

1791
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:25,054
Wait.

1792
00:43:28,057 --> 00:43:29,643
What's happening?

1793
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:31,561
Hey!

1794
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:42,925
Father

1795
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:45,594
I see you

1796
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:58,773
This creature--

1797
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,152
why do you bring him here?

1798
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:04,989
I was going to kill him

1799
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,115
but there was a sing from Eywa

1800
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:09,284
I have said

1801
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,579
no dreamwalker will come here

1802
00:45:11,704 --> 00:45:13,038
What's he saying?

1803
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:15,958
His alien smell fills my nose

1804
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,083
Hey, what's he saying?

1805
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,961
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

1806
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:24,382
Your father.
It's nice to meet you, sir.

1807
00:45:28,012 --> 00:45:29,429
Step back!

1808
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:34,768
I will look at this alien

1809
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:36,436
That is Mother.

1810
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:40,481
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

1811
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:42,693
Who's Eywa?

1812
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:51,284
What are you called?

1813
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,621
Jake Sully.

1814
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:06,300
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

1815
00:46:07,717 --> 00:46:10,637
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

1816
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:14,099
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

1817
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,894
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

1818
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:21,815
Just ask Dr. Augustine.
I'm no scientist.

1819
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,317
What are you?

1820
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,822
I was a Marine. A--

1821
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:32,326
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

1822
00:46:32,784 --> 00:46:33,994
A warrior!

1823
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,579
I could kill him easily!

1824
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:36,829
No!

1825
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:41,501
This is the first warrior dreamwalker

1826
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:43,461
we have seen

1827
00:46:43,586 --> 00:46:46,340
We need to learn more about him

1828
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,677
My Daughter--

1829
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:55,056
you will teach him our way,

1830
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:58,561
to speak and walk as we do

1831
00:46:58,686 --> 00:47:02,231
Why me? That's not fair

1832
00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:07,193
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

1833
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:10,864
Learn well, Jakesully.

1834
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:15,494
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

1835
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,681
Good evening.

1836
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,476
Please don't get up.

1837
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:43,688
Excuse me.

1838
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:47,150
Sorry.

1839
00:47:50,278 --> 00:47:51,989
Hey, how you doing?

1840
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,952
- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha

1841
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:41,079
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!

1842
00:48:42,956 --> 00:48:45,960
Come on back, kid. Come on.
That's it.

1843
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,297
There you go.
There you go, there you go.

1844
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:52,757
You're okay. You're okay.

1845
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:55,760
Damn!
You were dug in like a tick.

1846
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,432
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

1847
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,271
And you are not gonna believe
where I am.

1848
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,275
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

1849
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,403
disappearing into the brush
with this angry thanator coming after him.

1850
00:49:13,528 --> 00:49:16,447
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

1851
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:18,867
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

1852
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:22,246
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

1853
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:25,081
"Jarhead clan"?

1854
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,711
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.

1855
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:34,257
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

1856
00:49:34,382 --> 00:49:35,925
That's called taking the initiative, son.

1857
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,512
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully. Sully.

1858
00:49:38,637 --> 00:49:42,016
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

1859
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:48,563
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

1860
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:50,481
But no, no, no, they like mud.

1861
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:54,485
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're--

1862
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:58,157
Hey, can you-- Can somebody just--
Sector 12.

1863
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:03,077
Okay, go, go, go, stop.
Stop--

1864
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:05,289
Rich, stop!
That's-- Jesus!

1865
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:11,461
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

1866
00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:16,884
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

1867
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:23,181
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.

1868
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:28,603
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.

1869
00:50:29,146 --> 00:50:31,815
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey.
Look. Look.

1870
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,527
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

1871
00:50:35,652 --> 00:50:39,364
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

1872
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:42,617
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

1873
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:45,871
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

1874
00:50:46,664 --> 00:50:49,708
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

1875
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:54,045
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

1876
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,090
Well, we're wasting time.

1877
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,175
I like this guy.

1878
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:01,804
- Guys, right now--
- Okay, let's run through them again.

1879
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:04,222
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

1880
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:09,228
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

1881
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:12,438
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

1882
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,108
Got it.

1883
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:16,402
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

1884
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,237
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

1885
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:23,742
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik

1886
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,786
They become a mated pair.

1887
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:29,123
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

1888
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:33,626
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

1889
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:35,086
Everything they know!

1890
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:37,255
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

1891
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,715
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

1892
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,467
- Come on. That's--
- All right, knock it off, you two.

1893
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:43,094
Let's go.
Village life starts early.

1894
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:47,766
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

1895
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:08,119
Easy, boy.

1896
00:52:08,786 --> 00:52:10,831
Pale is female.

1897
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,211
Okay. Easy, girl.

1898
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:48,744
That is tsaheylu.
The bond

1899
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:52,164
Feel her.

1900
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:59,420
Feel her heartbeat.
Her breath.

1901
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,217
Feel her strong legs.

1902
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,014
You may tell her what to do.

1903
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:10,306
Inside.

1904
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:14,186
For now, say where to go.

1905
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,440
Forward!

1906
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:39,168
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.

1907
00:53:40,628 --> 00:53:42,882
I knew you could speak English.

1908
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:47,510
This alien will learn nothing,

1909
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:49,554
a rock sees more,

1910
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:51,806
look at him

1911
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:02,275
Again.

1912
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,820
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

1913
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:08,407
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

1914
00:54:08,532 --> 00:54:10,534
There's an outer row of columns.

1915
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:13,369
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

1916
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:17,081
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

1917
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,585
That's how they move up and down.

1918
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,503
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

1919
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,922
Roger that.

1920
00:54:24,047 --> 00:54:26,675
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

1921
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,594
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

1922
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:37,603
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

1923
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:43,108
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

1924
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:46,445
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

1925
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,489
way up in the mountains.

1926
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,574
The Hallelujah Mountains?

1927
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:53,952
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

1928
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:55,954
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1929
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:03,128
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

1930
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,476
We're getting close.

1931
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:21,230
Yeah, look at my instruments.

1932
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:24,275
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

1933
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,610
We're VFR from here on.

1934
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:28,570
What's VFR?

1935
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:30,989
Means you gotta see where you're going.

1936
00:55:31,114 --> 00:55:34,994
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

1937
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:56,139
Oh, my God.

1938
00:56:07,193 --> 00:56:08,527
You should see your faces.

1939
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:38,139
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

1940
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:58,244
Welcome to camp.

1941
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:06,751
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

1942
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:10,088
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

1943
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:13,675
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy, you'll take the top one

1944
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,177
She knew I was talking to the Colonel

1945
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:19,889
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

1946
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,599
so she's playing nice

1947
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:26,730
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

1948
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,695
Unit one. Beulah.
She's the least glitchy.

1949
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:24,246
Holy shit!

1950
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:27,041
Do not look in her eye.

1951
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:37,342
Ikran is not horse

1952
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,346
Once tsaheylu is made,

1953
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:48,521
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life

1954
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,199
To become taronyu, hunter,

1955
00:59:01,324 --> 00:59:04,869
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you

1956
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:09,458
- When?
- When you are ready.

1957
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:03,012
Okay. This is video log 12

1958
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,889
Time's 2132

1959
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,686
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack

1960
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,606
No, now.
When it's fresh

1961
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:18,110
Okay, location, shack,

1962
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,447
and the days are starting
to blur together

1963
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:26,744
The language is a pain,
but, you know,

1964
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:29,996
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition

1965
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:31,706
- Navi.
- "Nari."

1966
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,918
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!

1967
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:35,376
Narrri!

1968
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:38,338
Txur ni'ul. Stronger

1969
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,639
Neytiri calls me skxawng.
It means moron

1970
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:50,391
This is a very important part of it.

1971
01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:52,603
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you

1972
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:55,063
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

1973
01:00:55,188 --> 01:00:56,815
it's "I see into you. I see you."

1974
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,527
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too

1975
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,862
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

1976
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:05,157
I gotta run! Okay?
Let's go.

1977
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,536
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day

1978
01:01:11,454 --> 01:01:14,541
I have to trust my body
to know what to do

1979
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,382
Yeah! Check it out!

1980
01:01:22,215 --> 01:01:23,467
Oh, crap!

1981
01:01:27,762 --> 01:01:32,601
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

1982
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:34,894
the tiniest scents and sounds

1983
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:45,239
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals

1984
01:01:46,072 --> 01:01:48,701
I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final

1985
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:52,454
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know

1986
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:55,206
You need to listen to what she says

1987
01:01:55,331 --> 01:01:58,460
Try to see the forest
through her eyes

1988
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:01,130
Excuse me.
This is my video log here

1989
01:02:16,561 --> 01:02:19,106
With Neytiri,
it's learn fast or die

1990
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,525
You gotta be kidding me.

1991
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:53,724
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace
into the village

1992
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:55,518
Look how big you are

1993
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:57,478
It's the first time
since her school was closed down

1994
01:02:57,603 --> 01:02:59,396
You are so pretty

1995
01:03:00,898 --> 01:03:03,692
No, you don't.
Come back here.

1996
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:06,570
Bon appe'tit

1997
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:35,766
Come on, Marine.

1998
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,668
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

1999
01:04:03,793 --> 01:04:06,005
the people have to the forest

2000
01:04:06,505 --> 01:04:09,300
She talks about a network of energy

2001
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:12,677
that flows through all living things

2002
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:16,891
She says all energy is only borrowed,

2003
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:20,393
and one day you have to give it back

2004
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,376
I see you

2005
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,668
brother

2006
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,338
and thank you

2007
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,344
Your spirit goes with Eywa

2008
01:04:55,012 --> 01:04:56,722
Your body stays behind,

2009
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:59,682
to become part of The People

2010
01:05:03,478 --> 01:05:04,896
A clean kill.

2011
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:09,735
You are ready.

2012
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:38,764
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

2013
01:05:38,889 --> 01:05:41,432
is the test every young hunter
has to pass

2014
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:46,981
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are

2015
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:49,023
Oo-rah

2016
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:21,806
Now what?

2017
01:07:51,813 --> 01:07:53,731
Jakesully will go first.

2018
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,603
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside

2019
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:34,480
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

2020
01:08:34,606 --> 01:08:37,400
You will have one chance, Jake.

2021
01:08:37,525 --> 01:08:39,612
How will I know if he chooses me?

2022
01:08:39,737 --> 01:08:41,654
He will try to kill you.

2023
01:08:42,864 --> 01:08:44,240
Outstanding.

2024
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:45,927
Let's dance.

2025
01:09:52,059 --> 01:09:53,894
That moron's going to die

2026
01:10:17,835 --> 01:10:19,545
Don't be afraid, warrior

2027
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,171
Make the bond!

2028
01:10:24,632 --> 01:10:25,634
No!

2029
01:10:29,637 --> 01:10:30,680
Jake!

2030
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:46,322
Tsaheylu, Jake

2031
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,949
Tsaheylu!

2032
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,170
Stop!

2033
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:14,934
Yeah, that's right.
You're mine. Huh?

2034
01:11:28,197 --> 01:11:31,074
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

2035
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:34,787
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

2036
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,671
God damn!

2037
01:11:49,092 --> 01:11:50,344
Oh, shit!

2038
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:01,980
Shut up and fly straight!

2039
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,534
That's it. Bank left!

2040
01:12:23,918 --> 01:12:25,671
Level out! That's it.

2041
01:12:31,176 --> 01:12:32,469
Jakesully!

2042
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:58,328
Hey!

2043
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:05,668
Let's go!

2044
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,016
Yeah, baby, I got this!

2045
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:22,101
Oh, shit!

2046
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:31,153
I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this

2047
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:33,113
Yeah!

2048
01:13:34,113 --> 01:13:37,158
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

2049
01:13:37,283 --> 01:13:42,247
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
- Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard--

2050
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,311
The Tree of Souls

2051
01:14:49,731 --> 01:14:51,900
It's their most sacred place.

2052
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:55,529
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

2053
01:14:55,654 --> 01:14:57,698
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

2054
01:14:57,823 --> 01:15:02,328
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

2055
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,788
I would die to get samples.

2056
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:09,210
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

2057
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:10,711
You lucky swine.

2058
01:15:18,135 --> 01:15:21,846
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above

2059
01:15:23,224 --> 01:15:26,185
Only problem is,
you're not the only one

2060
01:15:30,104 --> 01:15:31,189
Dive!

2061
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:55,130
Go, go!

2062
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,640
Follow me!

2063
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:53,689
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

2064
01:16:54,606 --> 01:16:57,650
It is Toruk.
Last Shadow

2065
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:02,488
Yeah, right.
It's the last one you ever see.

2066
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:10,872
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto

2067
01:17:11,582 --> 01:17:13,333
Rider of Last Shadow.

2068
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:16,170
He rode this?

2069
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,422
Toruk chose him

2070
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,676
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

2071
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:25,720
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

2072
01:17:26,471 --> 01:17:28,349
Toruk Macto was mighty

2073
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:33,938
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

2074
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:36,356
All Na'vi people know the story.

2075
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:47,243
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

2076
01:17:48,409 --> 01:17:50,371
and in here is the dream

2077
01:18:10,932 --> 01:18:13,601
It's hard to believe
it's only been three months

2078
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:19,108
I can barely remember my old life

2079
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:24,529
I don't know who I am anymore

2080
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:46,092
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

2081
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:52,224
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

2082
01:18:54,475 --> 01:18:56,936
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

2083
01:18:59,523 --> 01:19:02,025
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

2084
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,944
No, I can do this.

2085
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:05,654
You already have.

2086
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:08,823
You give me good, usable intel.

2087
01:19:08,948 --> 01:19:11,118
This Tree of Souls place.

2088
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:14,954
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

2089
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:16,789
which it will. Yeah.

2090
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,710
Now it's time to come in.

2091
01:19:21,212 --> 01:19:23,087
By the way,

2092
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:25,591
you gonna get your legs back.

2093
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:30,054
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

2094
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:32,597
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

2095
01:19:32,722 --> 01:19:34,475
I'm a man of my word.

2096
01:19:37,394 --> 01:19:39,145
I gotta finish this.

2097
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:42,983
There's one more thing.

2098
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:48,655
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

2099
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,284
If I do it, I'm one of them.

2100
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:56,538
And they'll trust me.

2101
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:03,378
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

2102
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:19,520
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

2103
01:20:36,953 --> 01:20:40,916
The Na 'vi say
that every person is born twice

2104
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,381
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever

2105
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,184
You are now a son
of the Omaticaya

2106
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:02,645
You are part of The People

2107
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:50,944
Come. Come.

2108
01:22:08,587 --> 01:22:11,297
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

2109
01:22:12,925 --> 01:22:14,801
And sometimes answered.

2110
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:25,311
We call these trees
Utraya Mokri

2111
01:22:26,354 --> 01:22:28,064
The Tree of Voices.

2112
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:32,235
The voices of our ancestors.

2113
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:48,836
I can hear them.

2114
01:22:53,841 --> 01:22:55,384
They live, Jake,

2115
01:22:57,511 --> 01:22:58,845
within Eywa.

2116
01:23:03,057 --> 01:23:04,894
You are Omaticaya now.

2117
01:23:05,685 --> 01:23:08,730
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

2118
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:16,447
And you may choose a woman.

2119
01:23:18,615 --> 01:23:20,533
We have many fine women.

2120
01:23:21,784 --> 01:23:23,746
Ninat is the best singer.

2121
01:23:26,664 --> 01:23:28,542
But I don't want Ninat.

2122
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,797
Peyral is a good hunter.

2123
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:38,551
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

2124
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:42,389
I've already chosen.

2125
01:23:45,935 --> 01:23:48,395
But this woman must also choose me.

2126
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,025
She already has.

2127
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,559
I am with you now, Jake.

2128
01:24:28,143 --> 01:24:29,979
We are mated for life

2129
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:38,362
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

2130
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:09,976
Ma Jake!

2131
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:11,311
Don't forget your phase integration.

2132
01:25:11,436 --> 01:25:12,770
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

2133
01:25:12,896 --> 01:25:14,731
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

2134
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:28,162
Jake! Jake. Wake up!
Jake, please!

2135
01:25:28,828 --> 01:25:31,289
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

2136
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:34,001
Grace, I don't want--
Hey!

2137
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:38,922
Jake!

2138
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:48,974
Okay.

2139
01:26:00,069 --> 01:26:02,070
Here. I'm done.
Let's go.

2140
01:26:02,195 --> 01:26:04,405
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

2141
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:06,533
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

2142
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:11,956
Jake!

2143
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:23,716
Jake! Wake up!
Jake! Wake up!

2144
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,514
Hey!

2145
01:26:29,265 --> 01:26:31,641
Stop! Stop!

2146
01:26:31,766 --> 01:26:34,520
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

2147
01:26:38,774 --> 01:26:40,067
Hey, boss.

2148
01:26:40,568 --> 01:26:41,734
Hey!

2149
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,405
- What?
- I got a native

2150
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:48,408
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

2151
01:26:48,533 --> 01:26:51,619
Well, keep going.
He'll move.

2152
01:26:51,744 --> 01:26:54,957
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

2153
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,502
Stop! Hey!

2154
01:26:59,627 --> 01:27:01,921
Go! Go!

2155
01:27:02,965 --> 01:27:04,341
There, see? He moved.

2156
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:18,439
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude!
Dude, no!

2157
01:27:19,398 --> 01:27:20,690
I'm blind.

2158
01:27:32,578 --> 01:27:34,787
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

2159
01:27:36,414 --> 01:27:38,042
Here, come on!

2160
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:05,528
Freeze it right there.

2161
01:28:07,154 --> 01:28:09,573
Scale up. Enhance.

2162
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:12,743
Son of a bitch.

2163
01:28:14,286 --> 01:28:15,703
Unbelievable.

2164
01:28:16,831 --> 01:28:18,916
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

2165
01:28:25,713 --> 01:28:28,007
Tsu'tey will lead the war party

2166
01:28:34,556 --> 01:28:35,765
Stop please!

2167
01:28:37,393 --> 01:28:39,353
This will only make it worse

2168
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,188
You do not speak here!

2169
01:28:42,398 --> 01:28:44,233
We will strike them in the heart

2170
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:54,118
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

2171
01:28:57,287 --> 01:28:58,788
- You!
- Listen. Brother--

2172
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:07,422
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.

2173
01:29:08,756 --> 01:29:10,676
Is this true?

2174
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:15,389
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

2175
01:29:16,806 --> 01:29:17,932
Brother, please.

2176
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:21,811
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

2177
01:29:21,936 --> 01:29:24,189
You are not my brother!

2178
01:29:27,443 --> 01:29:29,153
And I am not your enemy!

2179
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:33,657
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

2180
01:29:35,951 --> 01:29:37,703
Go! Go! Go!

2181
01:29:40,956 --> 01:29:43,375
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

2182
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:44,835
Tsu'tey!

2183
01:29:51,091 --> 01:29:53,969
I am Omaticaya.
I am one of you.

2184
01:29:54,802 --> 01:29:57,014
And I have the right to speak.

2185
01:30:01,601 --> 01:30:03,520
I have something to say

2186
01:30:05,898 --> 01:30:07,399
to all of you

2187
01:30:11,403 --> 01:30:13,447
The words are like stones in my heart.

2188
01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:19,744
Sir, I'm sorry.
No, no, no! Hold on!

2189
01:30:19,869 --> 01:30:22,081
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

2190
01:30:23,289 --> 01:30:24,625
It's very dangerous!

2191
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:28,378
Grace!

2192
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:30,797
Oh, no.

2193
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:33,007
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

2194
01:30:34,551 --> 01:30:36,804
Okay. Look--

2195
01:30:37,887 --> 01:30:39,180
I was sent here to--

2196
01:30:42,851 --> 01:30:44,228
You see?

2197
01:30:44,435 --> 01:30:47,021
It is a demon in a false body

2198
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:10,171
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

2199
01:31:13,631 --> 01:31:15,759
Wheel this meat out of here.

2200
01:31:17,552 --> 01:31:20,055
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

2201
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:25,060
You let me down, son.

2202
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,314
So, what,

2203
01:31:29,856 --> 01:31:31,817
you find yourself some local tail

2204
01:31:31,942 --> 01:31:35,069
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

2205
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:37,698
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

2206
01:31:37,823 --> 01:31:40,283
- Parker--
- Shut your pie hole!

2207
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:44,579
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

2208
01:31:44,704 --> 01:31:47,416
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

2209
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:50,252
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

2210
01:31:50,377 --> 01:31:52,796
You say you want
to keep your people alive?

2211
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:54,923
You start by listening to her.

2212
01:31:55,048 --> 01:31:57,259
Those trees were sacred
to the Omaticaya

2213
01:31:57,384 --> 01:31:59,136
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

2214
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:01,514
You throw a stick in the air around here,

2215
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:04,600
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

2216
01:32:04,725 --> 01:32:06,018
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

2217
01:32:06,143 --> 01:32:10,523
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

2218
01:32:10,648 --> 01:32:13,274
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

2219
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:14,818
Which is what, exactly?

2220
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:17,195
What we think we know

2221
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,658
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

2222
01:32:20,783 --> 01:32:25,119
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

2223
01:32:25,246 --> 01:32:29,792
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

2224
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:33,087
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

2225
01:32:34,003 --> 01:32:36,215
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

2226
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,676
It's more connections
than the human brain.

2227
01:32:39,885 --> 01:32:42,387
Get it? It's a network.

2228
01:32:42,512 --> 01:32:45,474
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

2229
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:49,060
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

2230
01:32:49,185 --> 01:32:51,855
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

2231
01:32:52,523 --> 01:32:53,524
Yes!

2232
01:32:54,774 --> 01:32:58,863
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

2233
01:32:59,529 --> 01:33:01,614
They're just goddamn trees!

2234
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:06,078
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

2235
01:33:06,203 --> 01:33:10,666
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

2236
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:14,461
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

2237
01:33:14,587 --> 01:33:18,841
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

2238
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:23,595
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

2239
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:27,807
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

2240
01:33:27,932 --> 01:33:30,101
They're not gonna give up their home

2241
01:33:31,936 --> 01:33:33,564
They're not gonna make a deal

2242
01:33:34,648 --> 01:33:36,900
For what? Lite beer?

2243
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:39,028
And blue jeans?

2244
01:33:42,323 --> 01:33:45,201
There's nothing that we have
that they want

2245
01:33:47,118 --> 01:33:50,122
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time

2246
01:33:55,085 --> 01:33:56,962
They're never gonna leave Hometree

2247
01:33:59,422 --> 01:34:05,386
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

2248
01:34:05,595 --> 01:34:10,059
Jake, thanks.
I'm getting all emotional.

2249
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:12,728
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

2250
01:34:19,777 --> 01:34:23,113
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

2251
01:34:24,073 --> 01:34:26,533
I'll drive them out with gas first.

2252
01:34:27,784 --> 01:34:29,369
It'll be humane.

2253
01:34:30,996 --> 01:34:32,413
More or less.

2254
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:36,001
All right, let's pull the trigger.

2255
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:41,548
- Come on, people.
- Oh, man.

2256
01:34:41,673 --> 01:34:43,341
Let's pack it up, let's go.

2257
01:34:43,466 --> 01:34:45,261
This is how it's done.

2258
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:51,600
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

2259
01:34:51,725 --> 01:34:55,729
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

2260
01:34:55,854 --> 01:34:59,274
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

2261
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:00,400
My God.

2262
01:35:06,698 --> 01:35:10,869
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

2263
01:35:10,994 --> 01:35:14,664
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to--

2264
01:35:14,789 --> 01:35:15,832
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

2265
01:35:15,957 --> 01:35:19,336
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

2266
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:21,130
All right? Look around!

2267
01:35:21,255 --> 01:35:24,925
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

2268
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:26,467
- Can you guys just please--
- Yes, sir.

2269
01:35:26,594 --> 01:35:29,054
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

2270
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,430
Are you gonna kill children?

2271
01:35:30,555 --> 01:35:34,435
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

2272
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,895
Just let me try to talk them out.

2273
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:39,189
They trust me.

2274
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:44,904
Calibrate fast.
We're going in, right now.

2275
01:35:45,029 --> 01:35:46,905
Calibrating three and four.

2276
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:49,949
- Run sequence.
- Initiating. Thirty seconds.

2277
01:35:54,371 --> 01:35:56,039
Listen to me.
You've got one hour.

2278
01:35:56,164 --> 01:35:58,708
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

2279
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:01,420
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

2280
01:36:07,342 --> 01:36:08,551
Father!

2281
01:36:08,761 --> 01:36:09,761
Mother!

2282
01:36:09,929 --> 01:36:13,097
Eytukan, I have something to say

2283
01:36:13,265 --> 01:36:14,516
Listen!

2284
01:36:15,643 --> 01:36:17,101
Speak, Jakesully

2285
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:21,524
A great evil is upon us

2286
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:23,650
The Sky People are coming

2287
01:36:23,984 --> 01:36:26,403
to destroy Hometree

2288
01:36:28,905 --> 01:36:30,282
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

2289
01:36:32,909 --> 01:36:35,621
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

2290
01:36:35,746 --> 01:36:37,664
Are you certain of this?

2291
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:45,130
Look, they sent me here
to learn your ways

2292
01:36:46,381 --> 01:36:49,592
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

2293
01:36:52,179 --> 01:36:55,765
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

2294
01:36:59,019 --> 01:37:00,479
Yes.

2295
01:37:00,604 --> 01:37:02,981
Look, at first it was just orders,

2296
01:37:04,524 --> 01:37:06,819
and then everything changed.

2297
01:37:06,944 --> 01:37:08,695
Okay? I fell in love.

2298
01:37:09,363 --> 01:37:14,618
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

2299
01:37:15,828 --> 01:37:17,246
And with you.

2300
01:37:18,288 --> 01:37:20,082
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

2301
01:37:20,207 --> 01:37:23,002
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.

2302
01:37:30,426 --> 01:37:32,802
You will never be one of The People!

2303
01:37:32,927 --> 01:37:34,680
- I shouldn't have--
- We tried to stop them!

2304
01:37:34,805 --> 01:37:36,765
Neytiri, please! Please.

2305
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:42,813
Bind them

2306
01:37:44,606 --> 01:37:45,649
Leave now!

2307
01:37:45,815 --> 01:37:49,110
You have to go.
They're coming!

2308
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,168
Time on target, one mike

2309
01:38:05,293 --> 01:38:07,212
Copy. We have a visual

2310
01:38:07,337 --> 01:38:10,298
Roger that.
Stay on heading 030

2311
01:38:10,423 --> 01:38:11,759
Roger, 030

2312
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:27,565
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

2313
01:38:29,234 --> 01:38:33,029
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!

2314
01:38:36,867 --> 01:38:39,118
Run to the forest! Run!

2315
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:42,832
Run! Run!

2316
01:38:42,997 --> 01:38:46,543
Have no fear

2317
01:39:03,394 --> 01:39:07,064
No! God damn it, run!

2318
01:39:07,398 --> 01:39:08,774
Take the ikran,

2319
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,400
attack from above

2320
01:39:14,738 --> 01:39:16,865
That is one big damn tree.

2321
01:39:24,414 --> 01:39:28,586
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

2322
01:39:30,587 --> 01:39:32,672
All right, people,
let's get this done!

2323
01:39:32,797 --> 01:39:35,592
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

2324
01:39:35,717 --> 01:39:37,720
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

2325
01:39:38,095 --> 01:39:39,262
- Fire.
- Firing.

2326
01:39:50,774 --> 01:39:52,734
Bingo.
Mighty good shooting, ace.

2327
01:40:00,743 --> 01:40:02,328
Sir, they've opened fire.

2328
01:40:04,287 --> 01:40:05,956
You've got to be kidding me!

2329
01:40:18,551 --> 01:40:21,055
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

2330
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,805
All right, let's turn up the heat.

2331
01:40:22,931 --> 01:40:25,809
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

2332
01:40:25,935 --> 01:40:26,976
Fire

2333
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:31,356
No!

2334
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:46,329
Get everyone to the forest

2335
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,961
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

2336
01:40:55,713 --> 01:40:56,923
Neytiri!

2337
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:08,644
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

2338
01:41:08,769 --> 01:41:09,979
My God!

2339
01:41:28,581 --> 01:41:31,917
- Mo'at! No!
- If you are one of us,

2340
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,795
help us.

2341
01:41:42,552 --> 01:41:44,512
All call signs, switch missiles.

2342
01:41:44,721 --> 01:41:47,140
Give me HE's
at the base of the west columns

2343
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,351
This way!

2344
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,354
Rider section, switch missiles

2345
01:41:53,479 --> 01:41:55,356
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up

2346
01:41:55,481 --> 01:41:58,027
- Three's up.
- Yeah, baby, get some!

2347
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:00,820
Charlie Oscar,
Gunrunner standing by

2348
01:42:00,945 --> 01:42:02,280
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot

2349
01:42:09,412 --> 01:42:10,914
Come on, Grace, move!

2350
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:15,168
Down! Head down!

2351
01:42:17,755 --> 01:42:19,965
Come on, come on! Down!

2352
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:26,721
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target

2353
01:42:26,846 --> 01:42:28,015
Screw this.

2354
01:42:29,265 --> 01:42:31,226
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

2355
01:42:31,351 --> 01:42:33,103
I didn't sign up for this shit!

2356
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,657
Repeat. Ripple fire

2357
01:43:28,283 --> 01:43:29,784
Go! Go! Go!

2358
01:44:02,902 --> 01:44:05,320
No, no, get back! Back!

2359
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:26,926
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

2360
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:15,557
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

2361
01:45:16,266 --> 01:45:17,518
Let's boogie.

2362
01:45:17,935 --> 01:45:20,311
Dragon coming left,
heading home

2363
01:45:20,813 --> 01:45:22,730
Gunrunner coming left

2364
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:25,317
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies

2365
01:45:33,033 --> 01:45:34,033
Father!

2366
01:45:50,009 --> 01:45:51,176
Daughter,

2367
01:45:52,427 --> 01:45:55,639
take my bow

2368
01:45:59,643 --> 01:46:04,064
Protect The People

2369
01:46:12,489 --> 01:46:13,657
Neytiri!

2370
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:27,462
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

2371
01:46:28,171 --> 01:46:29,381
Get away!

2372
01:46:30,507 --> 01:46:32,217
Get away from here!

2373
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,304
Never come back!

2374
01:46:53,029 --> 01:46:54,113
Pull the plug.

2375
01:46:55,114 --> 01:46:57,701
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

2376
01:46:57,827 --> 01:46:59,744
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

2377
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:18,514
I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace

2378
01:47:19,931 --> 01:47:23,810
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

2379
01:47:26,646 --> 01:47:28,064
Let's go!

2380
01:47:35,948 --> 01:47:37,533
Put him down!

2381
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:43,622
You murderer!

2382
01:48:30,293 --> 01:48:32,378
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

2383
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:33,506
Hey.

2384
01:48:34,923 --> 01:48:37,592
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

2385
01:48:37,717 --> 01:48:41,012
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

2386
01:48:42,096 --> 01:48:44,600
Yeah. You know what that is.
Down.

2387
01:48:44,725 --> 01:48:47,185
- Trudy!
- All the way down.

2388
01:48:50,648 --> 01:48:51,814
Max!

2389
01:49:01,908 --> 01:49:04,411
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

2390
01:49:04,994 --> 01:49:06,079
Here.

2391
01:49:18,175 --> 01:49:20,594
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

2392
01:49:36,193 --> 01:49:40,072
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

2393
01:49:40,197 --> 01:49:41,407
Okay. Go.

2394
01:49:55,253 --> 01:49:56,380
Clear.

2395
01:49:58,381 --> 01:49:59,591
Come on, baby.

2396
01:49:59,716 --> 01:50:02,469
Colonel? Sir?
I got a situation here.

2397
01:50:06,097 --> 01:50:09,100
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

2398
01:50:12,188 --> 01:50:13,439
Three!

2399
01:50:16,317 --> 01:50:17,484
Come on!

2400
01:50:19,528 --> 01:50:20,820
Mask on!

2401
01:50:23,407 --> 01:50:25,201
Gas, gas, gas!

2402
01:50:26,868 --> 01:50:28,871
I'm taking fire!
Let's go!

2403
01:50:31,372 --> 01:50:34,502
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

2404
01:50:35,502 --> 01:50:37,296
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go!

2405
01:50:49,975 --> 01:50:51,268
Colonel!

2406
01:50:58,067 --> 01:51:01,529
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

2407
01:51:04,782 --> 01:51:07,408
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

2408
01:51:07,534 --> 01:51:08,993
Oh, yeah, baby!

2409
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:10,954
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

2410
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:14,166
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

2411
01:51:14,457 --> 01:51:16,210
- Grace is hit!
- What?

2412
01:51:17,418 --> 01:51:18,962
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

2413
01:51:19,087 --> 01:51:22,550
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

2414
01:51:22,675 --> 01:51:27,095
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

2415
01:51:30,474 --> 01:51:32,893
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!

2416
01:51:34,103 --> 01:51:35,895
Hold on.
I'm pulling pitch

2417
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:41,777
You're clear!

2418
01:51:49,743 --> 01:51:52,453
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

2419
01:51:52,579 --> 01:51:53,956
Copy that

2420
01:52:00,962 --> 01:52:04,257
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep! Still here

2421
01:52:06,135 --> 01:52:10,764
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

2422
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,932
It's strongest
at the Tree of Souls, right?

2423
01:52:13,057 --> 01:52:14,475
Yeah

2424
01:52:14,601 --> 01:52:16,520
Good. 'Cause that's
where we're going.

2425
01:52:25,404 --> 01:52:26,529
Ouch.

2426
01:52:29,992 --> 01:52:31,368
You big baby.

2427
01:52:32,744 --> 01:52:34,162
We're moving.

2428
01:52:34,747 --> 01:52:36,789
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

2429
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:39,877
I'm a scientist, remember?

2430
01:52:40,836 --> 01:52:43,255
I don't believe in fairy tales.

2431
01:52:44,131 --> 01:52:46,007
The People can help you.

2432
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:47,801
I know it.

2433
01:52:49,802 --> 01:52:51,639
Why would they help us?

2434
01:53:07,695 --> 01:53:10,783
The People say Eywa will provide

2435
01:53:12,743 --> 01:53:15,412
With no home, no hope,

2436
01:53:16,538 --> 01:53:18,666
there was only one place they could go

2437
01:53:33,096 --> 01:53:34,265
Link's running.

2438
01:53:35,015 --> 01:53:37,976
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

2439
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:43,690
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place

2440
01:53:44,733 --> 01:53:46,068
I gotta try.

2441
01:53:48,863 --> 01:53:50,155
Launching.

2442
01:54:11,676 --> 01:54:12,886
Outcast

2443
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,889
Betrayer

2444
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:17,140
Alien

2445
01:54:18,725 --> 01:54:21,395
I was in the place
the eye does not see

2446
01:54:32,614 --> 01:54:36,452
I needed their help,
and they needed mine

2447
01:54:37,411 --> 01:54:39,371
But to ever face them again,

2448
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:41,916
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level

2449
01:54:50,507 --> 01:54:53,801
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move

2450
01:54:56,596 --> 01:54:58,932
There's something we gotta do.

2451
01:54:59,057 --> 01:55:00,725
You're not gonna like it.

2452
01:55:10,778 --> 01:55:14,573
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky

2453
01:55:14,698 --> 01:55:16,283
Nothing attacks him

2454
01:55:16,826 --> 01:55:18,118
Easy, boy.

2455
01:55:18,618 --> 01:55:20,412
So why would he ever look up?

2456
01:55:21,579 --> 01:55:23,164
But that was just a theory

2457
01:56:33,903 --> 01:56:35,488
Toruk Macto?

2458
01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:16,779
I see you.

2459
01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:21,199
I see you.

2460
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:31,210
I was afraid, Jake.

2461
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:34,128
For my people.

2462
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:38,801
I'm not anymore.

2463
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,563
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo,

2464
01:57:51,313 --> 01:57:53,189
I stand before you

2465
01:57:54,315 --> 01:57:57,360
ready to serve
the Omaticaya people

2466
01:58:00,029 --> 01:58:04,243
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior

2467
01:58:05,452 --> 01:58:07,579
I can't do this without you.

2468
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,046
Toruk Macto,

2469
01:58:23,929 --> 01:58:25,639
I will fly with you.

2470
01:58:28,975 --> 01:58:30,685
My friend is dying.

2471
01:58:33,104 --> 01:58:34,606
Grace is dying.

2472
01:58:36,649 --> 01:58:38,485
I beg the help of Eywa.

2473
01:58:50,413 --> 01:58:52,373
Look where we are, Grace.

2474
01:58:59,131 --> 01:59:01,466
I need to take some samples.

2475
01:59:24,948 --> 01:59:28,993
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

2476
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,663
in this body.

2477
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:35,876
Is that possible?

2478
01:59:36,001 --> 01:59:40,463
She must pass through
the eye of Eywa and return.

2479
01:59:41,756 --> 01:59:43,259
But, Jakesully,

2480
01:59:44,301 --> 01:59:45,886
she is very weak.

2481
01:59:47,387 --> 01:59:50,181
Hang on, Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

2482
01:59:53,476 --> 01:59:56,020
Hear us please, All Mother

2483
01:59:56,646 --> 01:59:58,858
Eywa, help her

2484
01:59:59,649 --> 02:00:01,777
Take this spirit into you

2485
02:00:05,447 --> 02:00:07,533
and breathe her back to us

2486
02:00:11,453 --> 02:00:13,037
Let her walk among us

2487
02:00:15,623 --> 02:00:17,501
as one of The People

2488
02:00:46,447 --> 02:00:47,489
Jake.

2489
02:00:49,949 --> 02:00:51,076
Grace.

2490
02:00:53,244 --> 02:00:54,913
I'm with her, Jake.

2491
02:00:56,957 --> 02:00:58,292
She's real!

2492
02:01:01,377 --> 02:01:04,506
Grace? Grace, please.
Grace!

2493
02:01:05,716 --> 02:01:07,301
What's happening?

2494
02:01:08,301 --> 02:01:09,929
What's happening?

2495
02:01:14,307 --> 02:01:15,434
Grace!

2496
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:17,310
Grace!

2497
02:01:19,438 --> 02:01:21,023
What's happening?

2498
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,697
Did it work?

2499
02:01:34,411 --> 02:01:38,457
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

2500
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:41,877
She is with Eywa now.

2501
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:18,329
With your permission,
I will speak now.

2502
02:02:20,748 --> 02:02:23,168
You would honor me by translating.

2503
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:32,469
The Sky People have sent us a message,

2504
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:38,266
that they can take
whatever they want,

2505
02:02:40,101 --> 02:02:41,854
and no one can stop them.

2506
02:02:45,483 --> 02:02:47,234
Well, we will send them a message.

2507
02:02:49,904 --> 02:02:52,198
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

2508
02:02:55,533 --> 02:02:57,869
You tell the other clans to come.

2509
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:03,501
You tell them
Toruk Macto calls to them

2510
02:03:05,752 --> 02:03:08,506
And you fly now with me!

2511
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:12,051
My brothers! Sisters!

2512
02:03:13,176 --> 02:03:15,220
And we will show the Sky People

2513
02:03:16,262 --> 02:03:18,097
that they cannot take whatever they want,

2514
02:03:19,641 --> 02:03:21,060
and that this,

2515
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:22,810
this is our land!

2516
02:04:36,217 --> 02:04:37,677
We rode out to the four winds

2517
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:42,850
To the horse clans of the plain

2518
02:04:45,853 --> 02:04:46,854
Back to the stars!

2519
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:49,148
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea

2520
02:04:49,273 --> 02:04:50,483
For our children's children!

2521
02:04:50,608 --> 02:04:53,152
When Toruk Macto called them,
they came

2522
02:05:34,568 --> 02:05:37,029
Everyone on this base,
every one of you,

2523
02:05:37,154 --> 02:05:38,948
is fighting for survival.

2524
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:40,533
That's a fact!

2525
02:05:41,408 --> 02:05:45,119
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

2526
02:05:46,247 --> 02:05:50,083
Now, these orbital images tell me

2527
02:05:50,542 --> 02:05:53,712
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

2528
02:05:53,837 --> 02:05:56,340
to well over 2,000 in one day.

2529
02:05:56,923 --> 02:05:58,884
And more are pouring in.

2530
02:06:01,386 --> 02:06:04,765
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

2531
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,184
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

2532
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:09,478
Well, that's not gonna happen!

2533
02:06:11,104 --> 02:06:14,692
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

2534
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:17,153
We will fight terror with terror.

2535
02:06:21,489 --> 02:06:25,618
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

2536
02:06:25,743 --> 02:06:28,079
is protected by their--

2537
02:06:28,204 --> 02:06:29,539
Their deity.

2538
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,917
And when we destroy it,

2539
02:06:33,042 --> 02:06:35,337
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

2540
02:06:35,462 --> 02:06:38,923
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks
of this place ever again.

2541
02:06:39,048 --> 02:06:41,719
And that, too, is a fact.

2542
02:06:42,469 --> 02:06:44,180
Yeah! Yeah.

2543
02:06:54,689 --> 02:06:58,610
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber

2544
02:06:58,735 --> 02:07:00,945
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives

2545
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:03,948
It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign

2546
02:07:04,073 --> 02:07:05,951
Fricking daisy cutters!

2547
02:07:07,494 --> 02:07:10,288
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him

2548
02:07:10,413 --> 02:07:12,457
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow

2549
02:07:12,582 --> 02:07:14,417
- Max! Max!
- I gotta go

2550
02:07:16,337 --> 02:07:17,796
We're screwed!

2551
02:07:19,297 --> 02:07:21,466
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

2552
02:07:21,591 --> 02:07:23,761
that didn't involve martyrdom.

2553
02:07:25,261 --> 02:07:28,599
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

2554
02:07:31,644 --> 02:07:33,645
I have 15 clans out there.

2555
02:07:34,354 --> 02:07:36,439
That's over 2,000 warriors.

2556
02:07:37,983 --> 02:07:42,404
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

2557
02:07:43,488 --> 02:07:47,493
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

2558
02:07:48,034 --> 02:07:49,494
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

2559
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:53,832
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

2560
02:07:55,751 --> 02:07:59,171
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

2561
02:07:59,296 --> 02:08:00,463
Yeah, I know.

2562
02:08:00,588 --> 02:08:03,050
If they get to the Tree of Souls,
it's over.

2563
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:06,345
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

2564
02:08:07,179 --> 02:08:09,139
It'll destroy them.

2565
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:11,641
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

2566
02:08:26,739 --> 02:08:29,702
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

2567
02:08:32,162 --> 02:08:36,876
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

2568
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:43,841
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

2569
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:47,219
See the world we come from.

2570
02:08:48,345 --> 02:08:50,221
There's no green there.

2571
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:53,600
They killed their Mother.

2572
02:08:54,435 --> 02:08:56,895
And they're gonna do the same here.

2573
02:08:58,564 --> 02:09:01,108
More Sky People are gonna come.

2574
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:04,235
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

2575
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:07,280
Unless we stop them.

2576
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:12,953
Look, you chose me for something.

2577
02:09:14,454 --> 02:09:16,289
I will stand and fight.

2578
02:09:17,373 --> 02:09:18,917
You know I will.

2579
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,671
But I need a little help here.

2580
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:32,847
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

2581
02:09:34,682 --> 02:09:38,103
She protects only the balance of life.

2582
02:09:49,948 --> 02:09:51,617
It was worth a try.

2583
02:10:22,355 --> 02:10:24,315
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

2584
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:27,735
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

2585
02:10:39,873 --> 02:10:43,210
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex

2586
02:10:43,627 --> 02:10:47,172
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode

2587
02:11:22,123 --> 02:11:23,958
This is Papa Dragon.

2588
02:11:24,083 --> 02:11:27,128
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

2589
02:11:34,677 --> 02:11:38,390
- Suit Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

2590
02:11:48,984 --> 02:11:50,569
Move, move, move!

2591
02:11:56,242 --> 02:11:57,993
Bravo 1-1, move left

2592
02:11:58,577 --> 02:12:01,956
Bravo 1-1 moving left.
Watch flank

2593
02:12:04,332 --> 02:12:07,877
- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that

2594
02:12:08,002 --> 02:12:10,338
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing

2595
02:12:10,463 --> 02:12:11,756
Copy that. Over

2596
02:12:11,881 --> 02:12:16,511
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

2597
02:12:17,136 --> 02:12:20,431
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target

2598
02:12:20,557 --> 02:12:22,935
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle

2599
02:12:28,064 --> 02:12:30,568
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

2600
02:12:31,569 --> 02:12:34,154
Gun crews,
keep your head on a swivel

2601
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:37,198
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there

2602
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:42,037
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

2603
02:12:42,162 --> 02:12:44,331
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

2604
02:12:44,497 --> 02:12:46,958
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

2605
02:12:47,792 --> 02:12:49,962
Roll it to the ramp!
Let's go!

2606
02:12:52,256 --> 02:12:53,298
Hold!

2607
02:13:01,347 --> 02:13:03,350
Charlie 2-1, got big movement

2608
02:13:03,475 --> 02:13:04,851
- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up

2609
02:13:04,976 --> 02:13:09,105
- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position

2610
02:13:15,237 --> 02:13:18,157
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

2611
02:13:18,282 --> 02:13:20,783
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!

2612
02:13:21,202 --> 02:13:23,871
Targets closing.
Range, 400 meters

2613
02:13:24,622 --> 02:13:27,332
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir. It's the Flux.

2614
02:13:55,653 --> 02:13:58,279
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

2615
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:42,783
All aircraft, weapons free!
Weapons free!

2616
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:45,118
Break right. Come around.

2617
02:14:48,706 --> 02:14:50,166
Light them up!

2618
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:00,009
Break formation,
engage all hostiles.

2619
02:15:07,307 --> 02:15:09,143
Yeah! Get some!

2620
02:15:48,181 --> 02:15:49,975
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

2621
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:02,613
Jake! Jake! You copy?

2622
02:16:03,322 --> 02:16:05,990
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

2623
02:16:06,115 --> 02:16:07,117
Copy. Get out of there.

2624
02:16:12,206 --> 02:16:13,582
That's him. Get after him!

2625
02:16:30,557 --> 02:16:32,016
Take him out!

2626
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:41,777
Light her up!

2627
02:16:50,827 --> 02:16:52,203
Right there!

2628
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:54,582
You're not the only one
with a gun, bitch.

2629
02:16:54,873 --> 02:16:56,500
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

2630
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:57,626
Arming all pods.

2631
02:17:03,381 --> 02:17:04,424
That's it!

2632
02:17:35,121 --> 02:17:36,207
Seze!

2633
02:18:40,186 --> 02:18:42,355
Rogue One is hit.
I'm going in

2634
02:18:43,273 --> 02:18:44,649
Sorry, Jake.

2635
02:18:53,533 --> 02:18:54,576
Fire.

2636
02:19:12,719 --> 02:19:15,181
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

2637
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:19,684
Rogue One, you copy?

2638
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,854
Trudy!

2639
02:19:33,781 --> 02:19:35,033
Time to target, two minutes.

2640
02:19:35,408 --> 02:19:37,786
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

2641
02:19:37,912 --> 02:19:40,039
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

2642
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,715
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

2643
02:19:51,174 --> 02:19:52,343
Ma Jake!

2644
02:19:54,302 --> 02:19:55,429
I read you.

2645
02:20:04,604 --> 02:20:06,565
- Neytiri!
- Seze's dead

2646
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:09,652
They are very close.
They are many.

2647
02:20:11,111 --> 02:20:12,570
Do not attack.

2648
02:20:13,197 --> 02:20:15,114
Do you read me, Neytiri?

2649
02:20:17,743 --> 02:20:18,994
Do not attack!

2650
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:22,497
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

2651
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:31,799
Neytiri!

2652
02:20:33,925 --> 02:20:35,802
I got movement, I got movement

2653
02:20:35,927 --> 02:20:38,138
Hold position.
Something's coming.

2654
02:20:38,263 --> 02:20:40,014
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over

2655
02:20:40,139 --> 02:20:42,268
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation

2656
02:20:42,393 --> 02:20:44,060
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks

2657
02:20:49,233 --> 02:20:50,692
Hundred meters and closing fast

2658
02:21:07,292 --> 02:21:09,253
We gotta get out of here!

2659
02:21:10,796 --> 02:21:12,463
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! Move! Move!

2660
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:14,967
Fall back!
On the run! On the run!

2661
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:24,809
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

2662
02:21:31,691 --> 02:21:33,443
Eywa has heard you!

2663
02:21:44,038 --> 02:21:45,414
Come on!

2664
02:21:57,718 --> 02:21:59,552
Fall back! Move! Move!

2665
02:22:24,077 --> 02:22:26,664
Sir! All escorts are down
or falling back.

2666
02:22:26,789 --> 02:22:30,876
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

2667
02:22:31,001 --> 02:22:33,837
- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing to target

2668
02:22:33,962 --> 02:22:35,923
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

2669
02:22:55,775 --> 02:22:58,194
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

2670
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:00,989
Drop! Drop! Drop!
Go, go, go, go!

2671
02:23:34,772 --> 02:23:35,899
Brace!

2672
02:23:52,958 --> 02:23:54,251
It's Sully.

2673
02:24:08,014 --> 02:24:10,266
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

2674
02:26:47,466 --> 02:26:49,300
Come on. Come to papa.

2675
02:27:16,828 --> 02:27:18,581
Give it up, Quaritch!

2676
02:27:21,666 --> 02:27:23,127
It's all over.

2677
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,838
Nothing's over while I'm breathing

2678
02:27:26,963 --> 02:27:29,216
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

2679
02:28:25,397 --> 02:28:26,565
Come on!

2680
02:28:42,497 --> 02:28:46,543
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

2681
02:28:51,256 --> 02:28:53,384
You think you're one of them?

2682
02:28:54,676 --> 02:28:56,262
Time to wake up.

2683
02:30:40,532 --> 02:30:41,533
Jake?

2684
02:30:55,297 --> 02:30:56,340
Jake.

2685
02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:15,734
Jake.

2686
02:31:31,834 --> 02:31:33,793
Jake! Ma Jake!

2687
02:32:15,460 --> 02:32:16,754
I see you.

2688
02:32:22,468 --> 02:32:23,761
I see you.

2689
02:32:35,397 --> 02:32:38,191
The aliens went back
to their dying world

2690
02:32:40,402 --> 02:32:43,280
Only a few were chosen to stay

2691
02:32:55,501 --> 02:32:57,961
The time of great sorrow was ending

2692
02:33:00,088 --> 02:33:02,466
Toruk Macto was no longer needed

2693
02:33:15,020 --> 02:33:18,898
Well, I guess this is
my last video log

2694
02:33:20,775 --> 02:33:24,530
'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm--

2695
02:33:25,613 --> 02:33:28,408
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place

2696
02:33:32,037 --> 02:33:34,165
Well, I guess I'd better go

2697
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:39,795
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party

2698
02:33:43,174 --> 02:33:45,550
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all

2699
02:33:48,137 --> 02:33:50,388
This is Jake Sully signing off
