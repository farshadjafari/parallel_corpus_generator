1
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:38,692
2306, please.

2
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,392
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:48,292
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:52,892
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:56,892
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:59,592
and then I'll...
I would if I could.

7
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,792
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I...

8
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:07,092
let me get off and I prom...
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:12,992
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:23,292
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,992
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,692
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:31,292
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today...

14
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:34,592
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,692
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:40,492
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:43,192
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,492
- and he has certain parcels...
- Doctor...

19
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:48,592
well, could you get...
what do you mean?

20
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,393
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:55,393
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:59,793
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,993
He has certain parcels...
certain choice parcels

24
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,593
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:07,593
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:12,693
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,193
Okay.

28
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:17,893
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:23,293
Look, you sent in the...
no, no, listen to me now...

30
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:26,093
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:31,793
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:35,993
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,993
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:39,993
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,193
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:45,593
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:50,693
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:53,293
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:57,493
You never know... I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:01,793
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:05,093
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,993
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:09,393
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:11,893
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,193
You're on an override...
you make money, we make money.

46
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,293
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:19,993
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:22,393
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:24,493
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:27,393
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:30,493
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,693
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:34,693
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,093
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing...

55
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:39,093
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,493
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:43,993
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:45,793
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,893
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead...

60
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,093
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,893
I'm in a bind...
personal problems.

62
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:53,793
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:56,993
- I hear the new Glengarry leads...
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,993
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:01,693
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:06,193
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:08,493
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,294
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:17,194
Cutty, Al.

70
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:22,794
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,594
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:31,194
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:33,894
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:38,794
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:43,094
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:46,594
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:49,494
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:53,694
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,094
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,294
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,894
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:10,494
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:12,694
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:14,994
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:18,694
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,094
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook...

87
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:57,194
five units, Mountain View...
what happens?

88
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:59,094
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:01,694
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,294
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,494
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:08,494
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:12,194
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:13,994
- They won't give out...
- Uh-huh.

95
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,694
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,894
Who belongs
to the BM?

97
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:25,994
It is 7:30.

98
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,294
So who is that?

99
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,294
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,994
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,194
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,495
You're talking about what?
You're talking about...

103
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:44,895
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,195
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,595
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,595
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:52,695
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,395
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,495
I'm going anyway.

110
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:59,095
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:01,495
Put that coffee down.

112
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:09,095
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,995
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:19,195
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:22,195
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:23,795
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:26,995
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:34,395
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:38,295
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:40,095
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:43,495
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,995
The bad news is you've got...
all of you've got...

123
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:50,095
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:53,595
starting with tonight...
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:59,495
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:03,395
Good...

127
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:06,595
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,295
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:11,395
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,595
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:17,095
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,895
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:29,395
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:33,795
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:36,095
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:38,195
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:40,895
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:44,495
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:47,995
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,895
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:52,895
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:55,295
- What's your name?
- Fuck you...

143
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,895
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:00,095
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:04,995
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:12,396
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:15,596
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:19,096
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:22,896
Because only one thing
counts in this life...

150
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,296
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:29,296
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:38,996
"A-B-C."

153
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:42,096
A... Always,
B... Be, C... Closing.

154
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:44,096
Always Be Closing.

155
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:47,796
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,596
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:53,296
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:55,896
Attention...
Do I have your attention?

159
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,096
Interest...
Are you interested?

160
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,396
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:02,496
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:06,796
Decision... Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:11,496
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:13,896
Get out there...
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,096
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:18,596
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:21,996
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:23,996
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:27,296
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:35,696
Crap.

171
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,696
What's the problem, pal?
You... Moss.

172
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,196
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:43,496
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,196
You see this watch?

175
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:54,596
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:57,896
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:01,996
I made $970,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:09,396
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:13,296
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:17,396
Good father? Fuck you...
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:21,996
You want to work here...
close!

182
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:25,296
You think this is abuse?

183
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:27,496
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:31,196
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:35,797
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,197
I can go out there tonight...
the materials you got...

187
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:45,297
make myself $15,000.
Tonight... in two hours!

188
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:47,197
Can you?

189
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,997
Can you?

190
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:55,997
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,597
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:02,697
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:06,397
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,797
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:16,197
The money's out there...
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:18,597
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:20,497
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close...

198
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:22,297
close... it's yours.

199
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:24,497
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:27,297
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,997
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:34,197
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,397
These are the new leads.

204
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,497
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:53,297
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:56,097
Why?

207
00:17:56,197 --> 00:18:00,197
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:06,597
They're for closers.

209
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:13,997
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:16,297
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:25,497
And to answer your question, pal...
"Why am I here?"

212
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:28,497
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,297
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor...

214
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:34,297
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:36,897
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:50,497
Bunch of fucking nonsense...

217
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,297
treat people like that.

218
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,997
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:01,498
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:04,398
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:06,698
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:09,098
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:12,298
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:14,398
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,998
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:20,598
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:23,498
I think... I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:27,398
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:31,398
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:33,198
Thank you.

231
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:38,598
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:40,498
What is this in aid of?

233
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:42,598
- As of tonight...
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,898
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray...

235
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:47,698
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:49,598
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:51,498
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,898
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:19:55,898 --> 00:20:00,398
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,198
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,398
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,598
- Next man down the...
- What about the good leads?

243
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:08,998
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:10,898
They're old...
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:14,198
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,998
The new leads...
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:18,398
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,598
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:23,098
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,098
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,798
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:28,998
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:31,498
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,398
I suggest you... those of you
who are interested

255
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:37,298
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:20:37,398 --> 00:20:39,398
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:41,198
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:45,398
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:48,398
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:52,198
I... I can't...
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:57,998
Shelly, how am I
supposed to...

262
00:20:57,998 --> 00:21:00,698
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:12,298
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:15,698
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:18,798
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,898
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:25,498
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,899
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,199
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:36,299
I have some rather...
rather unusual,

271
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,599
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,999
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,699
Please listen closely...
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,399
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:53,399
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:57,199
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,999
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:03,899
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,999
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:10,299
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:12,399
in our land
development plan.

282
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:16,099
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:19,299
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:23,799
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,399
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,599
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:31,299
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:47,099
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,699
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,999
They're ancient...
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:53,399
Get some jerk
to come in here...

292
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:56,199
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:58,699
Send a guy out there...
no support, no confidence.

294
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:01,399
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:03,999
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma... fuck Roma.

296
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,099
Had a freak...
a little run of luck.

297
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:08,699
The leads are garbage.

298
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:10,799
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,999
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:17,699
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,699
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,699
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,999
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:28,199
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,299
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,599
I can't close 'em.

307
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,899
Life.

308
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:41,199
I swear to God,
you work all your life...

309
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:45,399
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:47,899
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:51,499
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,300
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,200
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,600
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,400
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,000
- Nope.
- All this garbage...

317
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,600
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,000
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,800
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,400
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,400
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,400
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,500
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,800
he's got that list...
with the nurses?

327
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,800
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

328
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,800
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

329
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,500
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

330
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,900
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

331
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

332
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,100
- You see?
- Yes.

333
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
For the leads... that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

334
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,400
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

335
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Who... who's got
a steady job,

336
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,600
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

337
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,200
Nurses.

338
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,900
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand...

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

340
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,800
- He's going wild.
- He is?

341
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,100
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

342
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,000
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

343
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,200
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

344
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,200
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

345
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,900
All that shit. Somebody told me...
you know what he's clearing, himself?

346
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,800
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

347
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,200
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

348
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

349
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,200
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

350
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,100
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

351
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,100
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

352
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,600
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

353
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
What do you need?
A telephone?

354
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,800
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

355
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,200
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

356
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,100
You can't sell to a void...
you got to get a goddamn person.

357
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,700
You get a lead, you get
a person... I'll go sell 'em.

358
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,600
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

359
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,700
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

360
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Yeah, we spoke...
last May I called you.

361
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,100
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and...

362
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,900
Arizona.

363
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,200
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

364
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,000
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value...

365
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,300
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

366
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,800
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

367
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,500
Look, I'm here overnight...
I have to go home tomorrow,

368
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,401
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that...

369
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:23,401
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

370
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:26,501
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

371
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:30,601
and make sure...
oh, gee, I wish that...

372
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:35,701
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

373
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:49,601
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

374
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:55,401
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

375
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:56,901
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

376
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:59,101
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

377
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,601
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

378
00:27:01,701 --> 00:27:05,001
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

379
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:07,501
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

380
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:10,901
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy... five minutes?

381
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:13,101
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

382
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:16,201
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

383
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,801
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract...

384
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:22,401
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

385
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:24,501
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

386
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,401
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

387
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:32,801
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

388
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,401
You got the new leads.
If you would give me... just hold on.

389
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:38,301
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

390
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:41,101
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads...

391
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,801
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

392
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:44,501
No, no... hold on,
will you?

393
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:47,201
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

394
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:49,201
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

395
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:53,001
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

396
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:55,601
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

397
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:56,501
Shelly...

398
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:59,201
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

399
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:01,401
I pray you never find it...
it runs in streaks.

400
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:04,401
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does... streaks.

401
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:08,101
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

402
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:11,101
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson...

403
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:15,401
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

404
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:19,101
1987, '88, '89...
six months in '89... who's on top?

405
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,701
- Roma.
- Under him?

406
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:23,501
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

407
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,201
April to September it's me...
it's no fucking Moss.

408
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,601
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

409
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:32,301
Talk... talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

410
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,601
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late...

411
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:37,001
Well, lately...
kiss my ass "lately."

412
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:39,801
You call Murray and you call Mitch...
when we were on Peterson,

413
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,501
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

414
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,702
He came in here...
"You bought that for me, fella."

415
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:49,702
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

416
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:52,002
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

417
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:54,602
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

418
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:59,002
I can't get a lead, you...
it was skill, John.

419
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:01,502
It could be working for you...
you want to throw it away.

420
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:03,802
- It isn't me.
- It's not you...

421
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:06,402
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

422
00:29:06,402 --> 00:29:10,202
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

423
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:12,502
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

424
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:15,302
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

425
00:29:18,502 --> 00:29:22,102
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

426
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:33,002
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

427
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:34,802
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

428
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,902
I do what I'm hired to do...
you might do the same.

429
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:39,902
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

430
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:45,402
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

431
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:47,602
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

432
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,702
Marshal your sales force?

433
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:52,502
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

434
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:54,502
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

435
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:58,602
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

436
00:29:58,502 --> 00:30:00,902
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

437
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:02,502
You give me
one premium lead...

438
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,302
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

439
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,602
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:30:06,702 --> 00:30:08,102
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

441
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:11,402
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

442
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:14,502
But I cannot sell shit!

443
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:17,102
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

444
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:19,202
Christ, I saw these back...
Homestead...

445
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:21,602
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

446
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:25,902
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

447
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:28,902
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

448
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:31,702
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

449
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:34,002
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

450
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:37,302
Hey, I need your help.

451
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:42,302
I can't do it,
Shelly.

452
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:49,802
John...

453
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:52,502
I'll give you 10%.

454
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,202
- Of what?
- My end... what I close.

455
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:58,202
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

456
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:00,102
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

457
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:02,202
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

458
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:04,402
What if you don't,
you understand?

459
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:07,402
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

460
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:09,202
- You see what I'm saying?
- John...

461
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,503
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

462
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,503
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

463
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:16,303
Now, 10% John...
I can get hot, you know that.

464
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:19,003
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist... fuck it!

465
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:22,003
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

466
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:24,703
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said...

467
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:27,203
"Attack."
Let's do something.

468
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:31,703
- Huh?
- 20%.

469
00:31:33,103 --> 00:31:35,703
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

470
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:37,803
- No?
- Oh!

471
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,403
Oh, shit.

472
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:04,203
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

473
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:09,103
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

474
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:12,503
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

475
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:15,303
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

476
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:18,603
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

477
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,103
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

478
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:27,003
John, a good deal... has got to be
one where both parties...

479
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:30,303
Okay, okay, okay, fine...
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

480
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:32,303
Let's go out.
We make some money.

481
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:35,003
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

482
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,703
and I want the good leads...
the Glengarry leads... two.

483
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:40,003
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

484
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:42,903
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

485
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:45,803
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

486
00:32:45,903 --> 00:32:48,503
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

487
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:52,403
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

488
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,203
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

489
00:32:55,303 --> 00:32:58,303
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

490
00:32:58,403 --> 00:33:00,803
What?

491
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:03,603
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

492
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:05,803
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

493
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,103
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

494
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,903
You fucking asshole.

495
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:14,303
I don't have it...
I don't...

496
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,703
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

497
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,103
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

498
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:24,303
I can't fucking
believe this.

499
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:27,703
All right, here's...

500
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:29,703
20... 30, and...

501
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:33,303
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

502
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:35,603
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

503
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:37,504
No.

504
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:43,504
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

505
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,604
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

506
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:50,604
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray... I got your job.

507
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:54,104
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

508
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:58,904
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

509
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,704
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

510
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,604
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

511
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:07,204
Give me... I'll take two more
of the old leads.

512
00:34:07,304 --> 00:34:09,904
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

513
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,004
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly...

514
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:13,204
I promise you,
I've been on the phone... I know.

515
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:14,904
No more leads today...
two per day. You've got yours.

516
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:17,004
All right.

517
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:19,504
- All right?
- Sure.

518
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:29,204
We will do that...
other thing.

519
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:34,104
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

520
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:43,204
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

521
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:47,004
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

522
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:49,404
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

523
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,704
- To get on the...
- To get on the board, yeah.

524
00:34:51,804 --> 00:34:53,904
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

525
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,704
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

526
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,804
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

527
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:00,604
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

528
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:02,904
These names come up...
you ever get 'em..."Patel"?

529
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:06,004
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

530
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,304
You had one,
you'd know it..."Patel."

531
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:10,104
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

532
00:35:10,104 --> 00:35:12,504
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

533
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:15,304
They like to feel superior...
never bought a fucking thing.

534
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:17,904
I don't know.
Come down the line...

535
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:22,504
doctors, lawyers, Indians...
times are tight. It's tight.

536
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:27,004
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

537
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,904
You go in the door... I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

538
00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:34,704
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

539
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:42,104
Remember when we were... when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

540
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:44,504
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

541
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:46,704
- They came in...
- They fucked it up.

542
00:35:46,804 --> 00:35:48,804
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

543
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:51,104
- We're stuck with this...
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

544
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:52,804
- This shit.
- It's too...

545
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:55,204
- It is.
- You get a bad month...

546
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:58,704
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

547
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:01,204
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

548
00:36:01,304 --> 00:36:03,605
I know, it's... hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

549
00:36:05,305 --> 00:36:09,705
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

550
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:11,505
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

551
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,505
Guys come in..."Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

552
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,005
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

553
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:18,905
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

554
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:21,805
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life...

555
00:36:21,905 --> 00:36:23,805
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots...

556
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,005
Boots, yes...

557
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:28,405
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

558
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,405
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

559
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,805
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

560
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:35,605
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

561
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:38,705
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

562
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,805
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

563
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:42,805
Come in.

564
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:46,205
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

565
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,905
Oh, "cats and dogs."

566
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:54,005
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

567
00:36:54,105 --> 00:36:56,805
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself... many years.

568
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:59,705
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

569
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:04,505
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

570
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:06,405
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference?

571
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:08,505
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

572
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:10,505
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

573
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:13,805
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

574
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:17,105
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization...

575
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:20,905
my representatives in this area...
and Mr. Spannel...

576
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,805
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

577
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:27,605
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

578
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,805
and he made me...
he made me an offer.

579
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:34,405
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan...

580
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:39,005
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

581
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:42,405
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

582
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:45,605
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

583
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:48,805
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

584
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,805
How can you present
investment opportunities

585
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:54,105
without television,
without magazine ads?"

586
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,105
I said, "You take
something this good,

587
00:37:56,105 --> 00:37:58,405
you go to a man...
has invested in the past...

588
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:02,305
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him... rebate.

589
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,505
And don't give it
to this expert."

590
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:08,905
So you're here
to sell me some land?

591
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:11,105
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you...

592
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,605
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

593
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:17,405
I think something
has to be fed,

594
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:20,405
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

595
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:23,005
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

596
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:25,305
- Mister...
- Just call me Shelly.

597
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,605
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

598
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,706
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the...

599
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:32,106
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

600
00:38:32,206 --> 00:38:34,406
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone... can't wait to meet her.

601
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:36,306
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

602
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:39,006
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

603
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:41,706
- I'm on a plane to Florida...
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

604
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:44,306
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

605
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,006
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

606
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:49,806
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

607
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:53,006
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

608
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:55,506
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

609
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:58,406
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

610
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:01,406
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

611
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:06,006
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

612
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:08,406
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

613
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,306
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

614
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,206
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year...

615
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:17,206
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

616
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:19,106
No, no.
Do you understand?

617
00:39:20,306 --> 00:39:22,206
Thank you. No.

618
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:40,106
- Roma, man... he don't care.
- He don't care.

619
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:43,606
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

620
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:46,106
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

621
00:39:46,206 --> 00:39:49,006
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

622
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:51,106
If they bounce you with no
confidence...

623
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,806
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

624
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,606
If they get you
on a bad beat...

625
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:04,106
and you got to go out there,
get a new job...

626
00:40:04,206 --> 00:40:06,006
- With no...
- With no confidence...

627
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:07,606
Yes.

628
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:11,906
I'll tell you what the hard part is...
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

629
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:15,406
You say the Nazis
in Europe...
"If they came in my door"...

630
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:17,906
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

631
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:20,306
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker...

632
00:40:20,406 --> 00:40:22,806
wants to break your rice bowl.

633
00:40:22,906 --> 00:40:26,406
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say... fuck you!

634
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:29,306
Sitting on the good leads.

635
00:40:29,406 --> 00:40:32,206
George, we're men here.

636
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:34,806
Yes.

637
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:38,806
And I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

638
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:41,506
- What?
- Starting up.

639
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,306
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

640
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:48,106
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

641
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:53,806
This is the difference...
listen to me, George.

642
00:40:53,906 --> 00:40:56,007
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

643
00:40:56,107 --> 00:41:01,707
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

644
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:05,907
I'll tell you... I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

645
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:09,907
What?

646
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:12,607
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

647
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:15,007
Somebody should do something
to them.

648
00:41:15,107 --> 00:41:17,307
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

649
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:19,207
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

650
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:21,007
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

651
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:22,907
- How?
- Someone should do something

652
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:24,707
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

653
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:28,007
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,507
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

655
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:34,707
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

656
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:36,707
and we go to Jerry Graff.

657
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:40,607
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

658
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:46,707
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

659
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:49,407
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

660
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:53,107
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

661
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:55,107
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

662
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:57,907
I'd really like to get it
off the books before...

663
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,007
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

664
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:03,607
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

665
00:42:03,707 --> 00:42:06,907
Now, I'm in town only for...
well, let me see.

666
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:09,907
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

667
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,607
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

668
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,207
As I said,
I could swing by tonight...

669
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:17,807
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

670
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:19,807
Grace, I'm gonna need

671
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:22,407
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

672
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:24,707
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

673
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:29,007
And put me
on the telex hookup... yes?

674
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:32,607
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

675
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:36,107
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

676
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:39,407
It gets so you don't
mind it.

677
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:42,607
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

678
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:45,307
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

679
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:51,407
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

680
00:42:51,507 --> 00:42:54,607
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

681
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:58,107
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

682
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,807
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

683
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:02,807
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

684
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:06,907
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

685
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:10,307
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

686
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:14,107
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

687
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:16,807
And then what?

688
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:20,408
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

689
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:23,508
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

690
00:43:23,508 --> 00:43:25,508
You think that,
act that way.

691
00:43:25,508 --> 00:43:31,908
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

692
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:34,008
That's me.

693
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:42,608
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

694
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,308
- Did I?
- Yes.

695
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:48,908
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

696
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:56,208
Great meals fade
in reflection.

697
00:43:56,308 --> 00:43:59,008
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

698
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:02,408
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

699
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:04,908
keeps us going...
it's only food.

700
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,508
The great fucks
you may have had,

701
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:10,508
what do you remember
about them?

702
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:14,608
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

703
00:44:16,508 --> 00:44:18,208
I don't know.
For me,

704
00:44:18,308 --> 00:44:21,708
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

705
00:44:23,408 --> 00:44:27,208
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

706
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:31,708
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

707
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:35,708
Or it's me in the...
I'm telling you...

708
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:39,708
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me caf au lait,

709
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:43,208
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

710
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:44,808
Eh?

711
00:44:46,908 --> 00:44:49,308
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

712
00:44:51,008 --> 00:44:54,708
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

713
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:58,608
That's it.
That's our life.

714
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:01,208
Where's the moment?

715
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:08,708
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

716
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:10,708
Loss. What else?

717
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:15,908
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

718
00:45:17,308 --> 00:45:20,508
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

719
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:23,708
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

720
00:45:26,108 --> 00:45:27,108
What could we get
for them?

721
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,908
- For them?
- For the leads.

722
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:32,008
What could we get
for the leads?

723
00:45:32,108 --> 00:45:36,408
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

724
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:40,708
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

725
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,908
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

726
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,308
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

727
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:48,509
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

728
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:51,909
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

729
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:54,209
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying... yeah.

730
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:56,909
A guy could take...
like anything else, it seems to me,

731
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:59,509
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

732
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:03,009
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

733
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:06,709
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

734
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:08,909
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

735
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:11,309
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

736
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:13,809
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

737
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:15,909
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

738
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:18,809
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

739
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,609
As a robbery? No.

740
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:26,309
- Well...
- Hey.

741
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,109
So all this...
you didn't actually call Graff?

742
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:31,709
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

743
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:34,009
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

744
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:35,709
- Did you?
- What did I say?

745
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,509
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

746
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:39,809
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

747
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:41,209
- We are?
- Yes.

748
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:44,609
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

749
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:48,309
It is a crime.

750
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:53,809
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

751
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:56,609
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

752
00:46:56,709 --> 00:46:58,109
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

753
00:46:58,209 --> 00:47:00,009
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

754
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,709
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

755
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:03,609
What did he say?

756
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:08,909
He'd buy them.

757
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,909
You're gonna steal...

758
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:23,109
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

759
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:26,309
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

760
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:29,609
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

761
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:33,309
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

762
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:35,309
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

763
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:37,809
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

764
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:42,209
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

765
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:44,509
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

766
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:47,409
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

767
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,809
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

768
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:52,009
He could take you on.
Yes.

769
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,210
Hello?

770
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,710
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

771
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,510
Sheldon Levene.
She's in...

772
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:26,110
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But... where's the duty nurse?

773
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,710
They canceled her...
well, let me talk...

774
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,810
who am I speaking to?

775
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,810
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

776
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:41,410
It's a big decision,
George.

777
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,810
At times a guy
has got to make one.

778
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,010
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

779
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,410
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

780
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,610
Yes.

781
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,110
Sometimes a guy...

782
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,510
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward...

783
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,210
That's absolutely right.

784
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,210
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

785
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:06,910
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

786
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,010
What?

787
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,110
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

788
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,310
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

789
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,610
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

790
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,410
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

791
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,410
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

792
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,210
It's when a chance
presents itself.

793
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,910
You got to go
in there tonight.

794
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,410
- You.
- I'm sorry?

795
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,110
- You.
- Me?

796
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,310
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

797
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,810
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

798
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,610
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

799
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,810
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

800
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,210
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

801
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:44,310
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

802
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,310
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

803
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,610
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

804
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,510
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

805
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,710
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

806
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,110
Yes?

807
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:58,210
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

808
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,610
- Yes.
- No.

809
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,210
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

810
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:05,810
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

811
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,610
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

812
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,110
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

813
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,610
Let me ask you this...
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,510
What if you don't get caught?

815
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,110
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

816
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:19,210
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

817
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,010
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

818
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,110
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

819
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,010
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

820
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,710
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

821
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:31,810
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

822
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,510
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught...

823
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,410
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

824
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,311
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

825
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,511
- Why?
- Why?

826
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:43,111
Are you going to give me $7,500?

827
00:50:43,211 --> 00:50:45,411
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

828
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:48,511
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

829
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,511
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

830
00:50:51,611 --> 00:50:54,311
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

831
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:56,011
- Me.
- Absolutely.

832
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,411
That's ridiculous.

833
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:59,311
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

834
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:02,311
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

835
00:51:02,311 --> 00:51:05,011
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

836
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:07,611
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

837
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,311
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

838
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:13,611
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

839
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:15,511
Just in or out?
You tell me.

840
00:51:15,611 --> 00:51:17,111
You're out,
you take the consequences.

841
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:19,111
- I do?
- That's right.

842
00:51:19,211 --> 00:51:21,211
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

843
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,011
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

844
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:25,711
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

845
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:29,911
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have...

846
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:35,011
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

847
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,411
- Huh?
- The thing.

848
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:42,411
You really...
what do you keep?

849
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:45,311
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

850
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,111
- No.
- Security.

851
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:50,811
Things. Things.

852
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:53,211
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:57,911
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

854
00:51:58,011 --> 00:51:59,411
You can't do it.

855
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:01,911
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

856
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:07,311
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

857
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:10,811
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

858
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:14,811
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

859
00:52:14,811 --> 00:52:18,311
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

860
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:21,511
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

861
00:52:21,611 --> 00:52:24,511
That's all they are.
They're an event.

862
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:28,211
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

863
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,111
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

864
00:52:31,111 --> 00:52:34,211
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

865
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:36,411
You see what I'm saying?

866
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:41,411
Things happen to you.

867
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:45,311
Glad I met you.

868
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:47,111
I'm glad I met you,
James.

869
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:51,911
I want to show you
something.

870
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:54,511
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

871
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:57,411
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

872
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:03,211
What is that?
Florida.

873
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:06,112
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

874
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:09,212
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

875
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:12,412
And that's what I said.

876
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:15,012
But look at this.

877
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:19,512
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

878
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:22,012
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

879
00:53:50,112 --> 00:53:52,212
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

880
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,912
I work, yes.
I work here.

881
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:57,412
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

882
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:07,912
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

883
00:54:10,512 --> 00:54:12,912
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

884
00:54:13,012 --> 00:54:14,812
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

885
00:54:14,912 --> 00:54:16,312
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

886
00:54:16,412 --> 00:54:17,612
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

887
00:54:17,612 --> 00:54:19,712
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

888
00:54:19,812 --> 00:54:22,412
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

889
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:24,912
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

890
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:26,912
They got... excuse me.

891
00:54:26,912 --> 00:54:29,012
Fuck.

892
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:31,812
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

893
00:54:31,912 --> 00:54:34,812
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

894
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:37,012
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

895
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:39,612
They got... listen to me.
They got some of them.

896
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:42,312
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

897
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,712
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

898
00:54:45,812 --> 00:54:47,412
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

899
00:54:47,512 --> 00:54:52,012
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

900
00:54:52,112 --> 00:54:54,412
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

901
00:54:54,412 --> 00:54:57,112
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

902
00:54:57,212 --> 00:54:59,312
- So far...
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

903
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:02,712
They got some
of the contracts?

904
00:55:02,712 --> 00:55:05,912
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

905
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,712
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

906
00:55:07,712 --> 00:55:11,412
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

907
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:13,812
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

908
00:55:13,912 --> 00:55:15,812
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

909
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,812
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

910
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:20,312
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

911
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:23,012
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

912
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,312
- I don't...
- I don't want to hear any shit.

913
00:55:25,412 --> 00:55:28,312
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

914
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:31,413
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

915
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:34,413
- The robbery makes difficult...
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

916
00:55:34,513 --> 00:55:37,113
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

917
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:40,413
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

918
00:55:40,413 --> 00:55:43,413
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

919
00:55:43,513 --> 00:55:46,413
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

920
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:50,013
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

921
00:56:00,813 --> 00:56:03,313
"Recontact James Lingk.

922
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:07,213
6:00 P.M. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

923
00:56:07,313 --> 00:56:09,813
When do you expect
her in?

924
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:12,613
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

925
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:15,813
She'll remember.
Just, just... wait a minute!

926
00:56:15,813 --> 00:56:19,213
Just to say... to thank her
for a wonderful time.

927
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,713
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

928
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:24,213
They should check
if we're insured.

929
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:29,213
Uh-huh.

930
00:56:29,313 --> 00:56:32,213
"10:00 P.M., Octavia."

931
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:35,313
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

932
00:56:35,413 --> 00:56:38,213
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

933
00:56:38,313 --> 00:56:41,313
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

934
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:55,813
I... you know,
they should be insured.

935
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,313
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

936
00:56:58,413 --> 00:57:00,913
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

937
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:03,613
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

938
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,513
That's right.
How are you?

939
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:07,813
I'm fine.

940
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:10,313
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

941
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:15,313
Yes. Okay.
The board.

942
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:17,913
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't...

943
00:57:20,213 --> 00:57:22,813
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't...

944
00:57:22,913 --> 00:57:25,313
What?
You can't do what?

945
00:57:25,313 --> 00:57:28,113
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

946
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:31,913
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

947
00:57:31,913 --> 00:57:34,213
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

948
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:36,713
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

949
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:38,213
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

950
00:57:38,213 --> 00:57:42,713
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

951
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:45,013
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

952
00:57:45,113 --> 00:57:46,913
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

953
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:50,713
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

954
00:57:50,813 --> 00:57:54,413
- He said he filed...
- He filed the big one.

955
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,614
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

956
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:59,214
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

957
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:04,214
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

958
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,914
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

959
00:58:07,014 --> 00:58:10,514
that would sap anyone's... wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

960
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:13,514
- They stole...
- They stole?

961
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:16,014
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

962
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:18,914
...when criminals come and they take...
they steal the phones?

963
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:21,214
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

964
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:23,914
they stole... aw, Christ.

965
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:28,214
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

966
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:30,214
You think they're going to catch...
where are you going?

967
00:58:30,314 --> 00:58:32,414
Down the street.

968
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:38,414
- Where are you going?
- To the... what do you fucking care?

969
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:43,014
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

970
00:58:43,014 --> 00:58:46,214
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

971
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,714
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

972
00:58:49,814 --> 00:58:53,114
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

973
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:55,914
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

974
00:58:55,914 --> 00:58:58,214
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

975
00:58:58,214 --> 00:59:00,814
Great.
Give them to me.

976
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:04,314
Bring them.
Come on.

977
00:59:05,714 --> 00:59:09,414
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a...

978
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:12,614
What am I going
to do all month?

979
00:59:12,714 --> 00:59:15,014
See, the thing
of it is,

980
00:59:15,114 --> 00:59:17,514
is were the leads insured?
You think?

981
00:59:17,614 --> 00:59:20,514
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

982
00:59:20,614 --> 00:59:23,014
I don't know, why?

983
00:59:23,014 --> 00:59:24,914
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

984
00:59:25,014 --> 00:59:27,414
- What?
- They'll be upset.

985
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:29,914
That's right.

986
00:59:30,014 --> 00:59:32,214
You're right.

987
00:59:33,414 --> 00:59:36,014
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

988
00:59:36,014 --> 00:59:37,614
- To...
- The cop.

989
00:59:37,714 --> 00:59:39,714
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

990
00:59:39,814 --> 00:59:43,514
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

991
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:45,514
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

992
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:49,414
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

993
00:59:49,514 --> 00:59:51,114
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

994
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:53,014
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

995
00:59:53,114 --> 00:59:54,614
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

996
00:59:56,814 --> 00:59:59,214
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

997
00:59:59,214 --> 01:00:00,314
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

998
01:00:00,314 --> 01:00:01,414
- Where were you?
- At home.

999
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,414
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

1000
01:00:03,414 --> 01:00:04,514
- Was I?
- Yes.

1001
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:06,814
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1002
01:00:06,814 --> 01:00:09,014
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1003
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:11,714
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1004
01:00:11,814 --> 01:00:14,414
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1005
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:16,414
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1006
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:18,814
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1007
01:00:18,814 --> 01:00:20,914
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1008
01:00:21,514 --> 01:00:24,515
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1009
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:27,015
"Ravidam Patel"?

1010
01:00:27,115 --> 01:00:28,915
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1011
01:00:29,015 --> 01:00:30,915
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm...

1012
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:34,215
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1013
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:37,115
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1014
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:39,015
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1015
01:00:39,115 --> 01:00:41,915
to deadbeats...
money in the mattress.

1016
01:00:41,915 --> 01:00:44,415
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1017
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,715
I got to go out...
fuck this shit.

1018
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:48,615
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1019
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:50,715
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1020
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,015
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1021
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:56,015
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1022
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:58,415
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1023
01:01:00,015 --> 01:01:03,015
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1024
01:01:03,115 --> 01:01:05,515
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1025
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:07,815
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1026
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:10,915
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1027
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,215
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1028
01:01:13,315 --> 01:01:16,015
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1029
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:19,015
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1030
01:01:19,115 --> 01:01:21,715
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1031
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:26,015
and figure out a way
to have your ass... fuck you!

1032
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,715
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1033
01:01:33,215 --> 01:01:36,315
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1034
01:01:36,415 --> 01:01:38,215
Get the...
I did it... I closed 'em.

1035
01:01:38,315 --> 01:01:40,115
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1036
01:01:40,115 --> 01:01:43,715
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1037
01:01:43,715 --> 01:01:46,415
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1038
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:50,615
- Rick... eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1039
01:01:50,615 --> 01:01:53,015
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1040
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:55,215
Who wants to go to lunch...
I'm buying.

1041
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:58,915
Williamson... $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1042
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,315
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1043
01:02:01,415 --> 01:02:04,015
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1044
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:06,515
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1045
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:08,715
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1046
01:02:08,815 --> 01:02:10,515
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1047
01:02:10,615 --> 01:02:12,815
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1048
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:15,715
- Shelly!
- Big deal... I broke a bad streak.

1049
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,015
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1050
01:02:18,115 --> 01:02:20,015
Thank you, George.
Hey...

1051
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,515
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1052
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:24,215
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1053
01:02:24,215 --> 01:02:26,515
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1054
01:02:26,615 --> 01:02:28,415
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1055
01:02:28,515 --> 01:02:31,215
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1056
01:02:34,015 --> 01:02:36,015
Fucking asshole.

1057
01:02:36,115 --> 01:02:38,215
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1058
01:02:38,315 --> 01:02:40,615
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1059
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,115
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1060
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:45,215
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1061
01:02:45,315 --> 01:02:48,215
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1062
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:50,616
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1063
01:02:50,616 --> 01:02:52,716
- Anybody talks to this guy...
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1064
01:02:52,716 --> 01:02:56,116
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1065
01:02:56,116 --> 01:02:59,216
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1066
01:02:59,316 --> 01:03:02,416
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1067
01:03:02,516 --> 01:03:04,916
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1068
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:07,516
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1069
01:03:08,716 --> 01:03:10,816
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1070
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,516
- When?
- Just now.

1071
01:03:12,616 --> 01:03:14,916
- Guess who?
- You just... this morning?

1072
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,416
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1073
01:03:17,516 --> 01:03:20,716
- You did that?
- Yeah... $82,000.

1074
01:03:21,816 --> 01:03:25,416
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em... listen to this.

1075
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:28,616
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1076
01:03:28,716 --> 01:03:31,116
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1077
01:03:31,216 --> 01:03:33,616
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1078
01:03:33,716 --> 01:03:38,516
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1079
01:03:38,616 --> 01:03:40,116
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1080
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,716
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1081
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:45,316
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn...

1082
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:48,816
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1083
01:03:48,816 --> 01:03:51,316
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1084
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:54,016
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1085
01:03:54,116 --> 01:03:55,916
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1086
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,016
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1087
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,616
Could we get
some coffee?

1088
01:04:01,616 --> 01:04:03,816
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1089
01:04:05,816 --> 01:04:07,016
Uh-huh.

1090
01:04:07,016 --> 01:04:08,916
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1091
01:04:11,316 --> 01:04:14,816
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1092
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:17,216
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1093
01:04:17,716 --> 01:04:20,016
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1094
01:04:20,116 --> 01:04:22,216
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake...

1095
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,516
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1096
01:04:24,616 --> 01:04:26,816
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1097
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,716
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1098
01:04:28,816 --> 01:04:31,816
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1099
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:34,716
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1100
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:38,016
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1101
01:04:38,116 --> 01:04:39,916
You bring that shit up...
on my volume?

1102
01:04:40,016 --> 01:04:43,216
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1103
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:45,716
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1104
01:04:45,816 --> 01:04:48,116
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1105
01:04:48,216 --> 01:04:50,716
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1106
01:04:50,816 --> 01:04:54,216
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1107
01:04:54,316 --> 01:04:57,016
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1108
01:04:57,116 --> 01:04:58,716
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1109
01:04:58,816 --> 01:05:00,516
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1110
01:05:00,616 --> 01:05:03,116
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1111
01:05:03,216 --> 01:05:06,116
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1112
01:05:06,116 --> 01:05:08,016
I get accused of...

1113
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:11,816
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1114
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:14,717
Is that what I did, Dave...
I humiliated you?

1115
01:05:14,817 --> 01:05:18,317
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1116
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:21,217
Sitting on top of the world...
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1117
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,517
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1118
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:26,417
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1119
01:05:26,517 --> 01:05:28,317
Fuck you, Dave...
you know you got a big mouth.

1120
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:31,617
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week...

1121
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:36,017
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1122
01:05:36,117 --> 01:05:38,817
"Let me buy you a pack of gum...
I'll show you how to chew it."

1123
01:05:38,817 --> 01:05:41,817
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1124
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:45,017
How fucked-up you are!

1125
01:05:45,117 --> 01:05:50,017
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1126
01:05:50,017 --> 01:05:53,417
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1127
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,517
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1128
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:58,217
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1129
01:05:58,317 --> 01:06:00,717
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1130
01:06:03,017 --> 01:06:05,317
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1131
01:06:07,317 --> 01:06:10,317
I never liked you,
anyway.

1132
01:06:10,317 --> 01:06:12,517
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1133
01:06:12,517 --> 01:06:14,917
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1134
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,817
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1135
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:19,417
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1136
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:22,917
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1137
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:28,917
You were saying?

1138
01:06:29,017 --> 01:06:31,717
Huh?

1139
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:33,617
Come on.

1140
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:36,017
Come on... you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1141
01:06:36,017 --> 01:06:38,717
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1142
01:06:38,717 --> 01:06:41,017
you got
the stats spread out,

1143
01:06:41,117 --> 01:06:44,417
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1144
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,817
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1145
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:51,017
- How was it?
- From the store.

1146
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:53,617
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1147
01:06:53,717 --> 01:06:57,617
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1148
01:06:57,617 --> 01:07:01,117
and take it... and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1149
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,017
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1150
01:07:03,117 --> 01:07:05,517
God, that's what
I've been saying... the old ways.

1151
01:07:05,617 --> 01:07:09,117
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1152
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:11,117
They got their money
in government bonds...

1153
01:07:11,217 --> 01:07:14,817
I said, "Fuck it... let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1154
01:07:14,817 --> 01:07:19,117
I take it and plat it out... eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1155
01:07:19,217 --> 01:07:24,317
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1156
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,917
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1157
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,217
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1158
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:33,817
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce...
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1159
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:37,017
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1160
01:07:37,117 --> 01:07:40,417
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1161
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:43,918
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me... the both of us.

1162
01:07:43,918 --> 01:07:47,218
What is the point
of some interim position?

1163
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:50,918
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1164
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:54,018
And I mean it, that's it...
all eight units. Period."

1165
01:07:54,118 --> 01:07:56,718
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick... hey.

1166
01:07:56,818 --> 01:08:01,618
I turned that contract around...
that's eight units, 82 grand...

1167
01:08:01,718 --> 01:08:05,718
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1168
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:08,818
I sat there five minutes.

1169
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:14,318
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1170
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:17,218
Ricky... not a word,
not a motion.

1171
01:08:17,318 --> 01:08:19,918
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1172
01:08:20,018 --> 01:08:22,818
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1173
01:08:22,918 --> 01:08:24,518
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1174
01:08:24,618 --> 01:08:26,718
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1175
01:08:26,818 --> 01:08:29,818
Nobody ever...
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1176
01:08:29,918 --> 01:08:32,018
No, what I did...
I locked on 'em.

1177
01:08:32,018 --> 01:08:34,718
I locked all on them...
nothing on me... on them.

1178
01:08:34,718 --> 01:08:37,818
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1179
01:08:37,918 --> 01:08:40,618
"Now is the time."

1180
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:45,218
They signed.
It was great.

1181
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:48,018
It was so fucking great.

1182
01:08:48,118 --> 01:08:52,018
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1183
01:08:52,118 --> 01:08:54,718
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing... just together.

1184
01:08:54,818 --> 01:08:59,918
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1185
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:03,618
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1186
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:05,818
passed it to her
and she signed.

1187
01:09:05,818 --> 01:09:08,118
It was solemn...
fucking solemn.

1188
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:13,218
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1189
01:09:13,318 --> 01:09:15,718
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1190
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,018
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1191
01:09:18,118 --> 01:09:20,018
He went over,
he brought us back a drink...

1192
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:23,618
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1193
01:09:25,218 --> 01:09:28,918
And we just toasted
in silence.

1194
01:09:28,918 --> 01:09:32,418
Great sale, Shelly.

1195
01:09:32,518 --> 01:09:34,518
Great.

1196
01:09:34,618 --> 01:09:37,518
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1197
01:09:37,618 --> 01:09:38,618
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1198
01:09:39,318 --> 01:09:41,318
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1199
01:09:41,418 --> 01:09:44,018
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1200
01:09:44,118 --> 01:09:46,718
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1201
01:09:46,818 --> 01:09:49,218
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele...

1202
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,618
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1203
01:09:51,718 --> 01:09:54,618
We had a little... you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1204
01:09:54,718 --> 01:09:57,618
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1205
01:09:57,618 --> 01:10:00,818
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make...

1206
01:10:00,918 --> 01:10:03,718
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1207
01:10:03,718 --> 01:10:06,518
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1208
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:10,019
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1209
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:12,419
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1210
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:16,519
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1211
01:10:16,519 --> 01:10:18,419
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1212
01:10:18,419 --> 01:10:21,419
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1213
01:10:21,519 --> 01:10:23,619
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar...

1214
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,519
you do not know how
to run this office.

1215
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:28,019
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1216
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:31,219
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1217
01:10:31,219 --> 01:10:33,919
- Did you ever sit...
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1218
01:10:34,019 --> 01:10:35,919
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1219
01:10:36,019 --> 01:10:37,919
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1220
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:41,219
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1221
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:43,819
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1222
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:46,519
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1223
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:49,919
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1224
01:10:49,919 --> 01:10:53,319
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1225
01:10:53,419 --> 01:10:57,419
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1226
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,719
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know...

1227
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:02,419
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1228
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:04,919
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1229
01:11:04,919 --> 01:11:06,919
For what,
two months, three months?

1230
01:11:06,919 --> 01:11:09,919
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1231
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:13,719
Luck... was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1232
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:15,619
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1233
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:19,319
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1234
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:22,719
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1235
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:25,519
Soft sell... we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1236
01:11:25,519 --> 01:11:27,419
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1237
01:11:27,519 --> 01:11:31,419
You wouldn't know, you cock...
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1238
01:11:31,419 --> 01:11:33,819
What the hell are you?

1239
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:36,619
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1240
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,119
That's my message to you...
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1241
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:43,919
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1242
01:11:44,019 --> 01:11:45,819
Period. Fuck you.

1243
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:49,119
Listen to me... you put me
on that fucking board,

1244
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:51,619
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1245
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:54,719
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1246
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:56,919
because I am
going to close them all.

1247
01:11:57,019 --> 01:12:00,219
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1248
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:04,619
He's right, Williamson.

1249
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:10,519
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1250
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:12,219
Mitch and Murray.

1251
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,519
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1252
01:12:17,519 --> 01:12:19,719
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1253
01:12:19,819 --> 01:12:23,119
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1254
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:26,019
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1255
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:28,519
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1256
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:31,319
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1257
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:33,120
I put her into it.

1258
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:36,420
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1259
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,220
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1260
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:43,020
- Take your time. If you still feel...
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1261
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,220
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1262
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,720
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1263
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,020
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1264
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,120
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1265
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:57,120
- Are you acquainted with...
- Black Creek? No.

1266
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,920
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1267
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,220
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1268
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,020
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1269
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,820
Beautiful rolling land...
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1270
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,320
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1271
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,220
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1272
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,220
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1273
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,720
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services...

1274
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,820
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted...

1275
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,720
I was at the Lingks'...

1276
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,220
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1277
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,020
- Which...
- "Home cooking."

1278
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,920
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1279
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,620
"Home cook..."
the monthly interview.

1280
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,820
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1281
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,320
Is that something
I can talk about?

1282
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,520
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1283
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,320
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1284
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,420
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1285
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,520
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1286
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,220
His wife.

1287
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,920
Ray, what time
do you have?

1288
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,820
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1289
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,620
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1290
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,620
Remember the 1:00... that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1291
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,820
You're right, the 1:00...
let's scoot.

1292
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,020
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1293
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,220
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle... John!

1294
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,820
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1295
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,220
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1296
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,720
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1297
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,820
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and...

1298
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,520
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1299
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:26,420
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1300
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,920
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1301
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:29,520
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1302
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,320
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1303
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,320
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray...
just a minute.

1304
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:38,920
Jim, I told you who he is... the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1305
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,220
His family owns 32 per...

1306
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:45,120
over the past years, I have sold him...
I can't tell you the dollar amount...

1307
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,920
but quite a lot of land.

1308
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:51,420
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1309
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,020
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1310
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,220
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1311
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:01,521
It's funny... you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1312
01:15:01,521 --> 01:15:04,021
all business...
this guy, I'll tell you.

1313
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:06,021
We'll go to his house
someday.

1314
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:10,221
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L. A?

1315
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:12,721
Ah, Monday.

1316
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:15,221
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1317
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:16,721
- My wife...
- Rick?

1318
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:20,021
I can't talk now, Jim...
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1319
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:22,421
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1320
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:26,721
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1321
01:15:26,821 --> 01:15:29,621
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1322
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:32,521
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1323
01:15:32,521 --> 01:15:37,521
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1324
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:39,821
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again...

1325
01:15:39,921 --> 01:15:41,821
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1326
01:15:41,821 --> 01:15:44,521
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1327
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:47,721
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1328
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:51,521
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law...

1329
01:15:51,621 --> 01:15:55,921
the man next to you...
bought his lot at 42...

1330
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:58,021
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1331
01:15:58,121 --> 01:15:59,721
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1332
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:02,321
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1333
01:16:02,421 --> 01:16:05,721
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1334
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:07,521
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1335
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:11,221
She called the consumer...
the attorney general?

1336
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:13,721
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1337
01:16:13,821 --> 01:16:16,921
The attorney ge...
it was some consumer office.

1338
01:16:18,021 --> 01:16:20,321
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1339
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:22,221
I don't know.

1340
01:16:22,321 --> 01:16:24,121
But they said
we have three days.

1341
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:27,321
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1342
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,421
Three days?

1343
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:33,521
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1344
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:37,221
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1345
01:16:37,221 --> 01:16:40,221
Of course you have...
three days.

1346
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,721
So we can't talk Monday.

1347
01:16:42,821 --> 01:16:45,421
Monday...
you saw my book.

1348
01:16:45,521 --> 01:16:48,121
Jim, Jim... I can't.

1349
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:50,021
You saw my book.
I can't.

1350
01:16:50,121 --> 01:16:52,121
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1351
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:54,221
Three business days,
they mean.

1352
01:16:54,321 --> 01:16:56,721
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1353
01:16:56,821 --> 01:17:00,121
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business...

1354
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:02,221
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1355
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:04,421
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1356
01:17:04,521 --> 01:17:07,121
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1357
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:10,621
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1358
01:17:10,721 --> 01:17:15,321
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...
so it would have elapsed.

1359
01:17:15,421 --> 01:17:17,321
What would have elapsed?

1360
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:19,221
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1361
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:21,521
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1362
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:23,321
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1363
01:17:23,321 --> 01:17:26,422
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1364
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:28,922
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1365
01:17:28,922 --> 01:17:32,322
- I don't know.
- Today.

1366
01:17:32,422 --> 01:17:35,622
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not...

1367
01:17:35,722 --> 01:17:38,822
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1368
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:40,822
It wasn't cashed?

1369
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,122
I just phoned downtown...
it's on their desk.

1370
01:17:43,222 --> 01:17:45,422
- Rick.
- One moment.

1371
01:17:45,422 --> 01:17:48,222
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1372
01:17:48,322 --> 01:17:50,322
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1373
01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:52,722
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1374
01:17:52,822 --> 01:17:56,822
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1375
01:17:56,822 --> 01:17:59,122
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1376
01:17:59,122 --> 01:18:01,122
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1377
01:18:01,222 --> 01:18:03,922
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1378
01:18:04,022 --> 01:18:05,822
from the time
the deal was closed."

1379
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:07,922
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1380
01:18:08,022 --> 01:18:10,122
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1381
01:18:10,222 --> 01:18:13,622
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1382
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,022
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1383
01:18:16,122 --> 01:18:19,022
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1384
01:18:19,122 --> 01:18:22,022
- I didn't rob...
- Shelly, get in the office.

1385
01:18:22,022 --> 01:18:25,222
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1386
01:18:25,222 --> 01:18:29,022
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1387
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:32,022
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1388
01:18:32,022 --> 01:18:35,522
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1389
01:18:35,622 --> 01:18:38,322
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1390
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:40,022
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1391
01:18:40,122 --> 01:18:42,122
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1392
01:18:42,122 --> 01:18:44,322
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1393
01:18:44,422 --> 01:18:46,422
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1394
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:48,622
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1395
01:18:48,722 --> 01:18:50,822
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1396
01:18:50,922 --> 01:18:53,422
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1397
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:55,522
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1398
01:18:55,622 --> 01:18:57,922
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1399
01:18:57,922 --> 01:19:03,722
No man has the right...
no man has the right...

1400
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:07,922
"Call an attorney"...
that means you're under...

1401
01:19:07,922 --> 01:19:09,922
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1402
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:11,922
That's not...
as long as I've...

1403
01:19:12,022 --> 01:19:13,422
Will you get out of here?

1404
01:19:13,522 --> 01:19:16,222
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1405
01:19:16,322 --> 01:19:19,322
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1406
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:23,622
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1407
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:39,322
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss?

1408
01:19:39,422 --> 01:19:42,522
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1409
01:19:42,622 --> 01:19:44,922
Will you
excuse me, please?

1410
01:19:48,522 --> 01:19:51,022
I'm sorry, I...

1411
01:19:52,523 --> 01:19:55,823
I apologize to you. It's...

1412
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:58,523
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1413
01:20:00,523 --> 01:20:02,323
What is it?

1414
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,423
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:20:04,523 --> 01:20:07,423
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again... your wife?

1416
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,623
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1417
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:12,223
She wants her money back.

1418
01:20:12,323 --> 01:20:14,123
We're gonna speak to her.

1419
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:16,723
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1420
01:20:16,723 --> 01:20:19,123
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1421
01:20:19,223 --> 01:20:21,023
- She...
- Roma!

1422
01:20:21,123 --> 01:20:24,623
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1423
01:20:24,723 --> 01:20:26,523
No. No.
This is something she said.

1424
01:20:26,623 --> 01:20:29,023
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1425
01:20:29,023 --> 01:20:31,223
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1426
01:20:31,323 --> 01:20:33,023
Listen, I do...
if I don't get my money back...

1427
01:20:33,023 --> 01:20:34,923
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1428
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:38,823
Listen... will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1429
01:20:38,923 --> 01:20:42,123
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1430
01:20:42,223 --> 01:20:43,723
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1431
01:20:43,823 --> 01:20:46,723
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1432
01:20:46,723 --> 01:20:50,423
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1433
01:20:50,423 --> 01:20:53,823
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1434
01:20:56,123 --> 01:20:58,123
This is me!

1435
01:20:58,223 --> 01:21:02,023
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1436
01:21:03,323 --> 01:21:07,323
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1437
01:21:07,423 --> 01:21:09,823
Understand?
This is me.

1438
01:21:09,923 --> 01:21:12,423
Something upset you.

1439
01:21:12,423 --> 01:21:14,723
Yes.
Sit down now.

1440
01:21:14,823 --> 01:21:18,723
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1441
01:21:18,823 --> 01:21:22,123
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1442
01:21:22,223 --> 01:21:24,323
You're goddamned
right I am.

1443
01:21:24,323 --> 01:21:26,923
Sit down.

1444
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:29,523
I'll tell you something,

1445
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:34,423
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1446
01:21:37,423 --> 01:21:40,023
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1447
01:21:44,223 --> 01:21:46,823
I can't negotiate.

1448
01:21:47,623 --> 01:21:50,223
What does that mean?

1449
01:21:51,523 --> 01:21:53,923
What?

1450
01:21:55,823 --> 01:21:57,923
What?
Say the words.

1451
01:21:57,923 --> 01:22:00,723
I don't have the power.

1452
01:22:00,823 --> 01:22:02,923
Okay, I said it.

1453
01:22:03,023 --> 01:22:06,423
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1454
01:22:06,523 --> 01:22:08,423
To negotiate what?

1455
01:22:10,523 --> 01:22:12,723
To negotiate what?

1456
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:14,623
This.

1457
01:22:14,623 --> 01:22:16,723
- What this?
- The deal.

1458
01:22:16,823 --> 01:22:18,724
The deal?

1459
01:22:18,824 --> 01:22:20,824
Forget the deal, Jim.

1460
01:22:20,824 --> 01:22:23,824
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1461
01:22:23,924 --> 01:22:26,524
What?

1462
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:31,224
I can't talk to you.

1463
01:22:31,224 --> 01:22:33,724
You met my wife.

1464
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:36,724
- What?
- Aw...

1465
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:41,024
I met your wife,
what?

1466
01:22:45,224 --> 01:22:47,524
What, Jim?

1467
01:22:49,524 --> 01:22:51,924
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1468
01:22:52,024 --> 01:22:53,224
Get a drink,
come on.

1469
01:22:53,324 --> 01:22:55,524
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1470
01:22:55,624 --> 01:22:57,424
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1471
01:22:57,524 --> 01:22:59,124
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1472
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:01,224
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise...

1473
01:23:01,224 --> 01:23:03,324
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1474
01:23:03,324 --> 01:23:06,824
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1475
01:23:06,924 --> 01:23:09,324
Am I talking
about the deal?

1476
01:23:09,424 --> 01:23:11,724
That's over.

1477
01:23:11,824 --> 01:23:14,424
Please...
let's talk about you.

1478
01:23:21,124 --> 01:23:23,824
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1479
01:23:23,924 --> 01:23:26,224
Your life is your own.

1480
01:23:28,024 --> 01:23:30,224
You have a contract
with your wife,

1481
01:23:30,324 --> 01:23:33,324
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1482
01:23:33,424 --> 01:23:36,624
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1483
01:23:36,624 --> 01:23:42,624
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1484
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:45,324
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1485
01:23:45,424 --> 01:23:49,624
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1486
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:52,824
This is your life.

1487
01:23:58,124 --> 01:23:59,924
Yes?

1488
01:24:02,524 --> 01:24:06,124
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1489
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:09,224
and that concerns me.

1490
01:24:09,324 --> 01:24:11,724
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1491
01:24:11,724 --> 01:24:13,524
Let's go, come on.

1492
01:24:13,524 --> 01:24:15,824
Roma.

1493
01:24:15,924 --> 01:24:18,624
- What?
- The check, it's...

1494
01:24:20,124 --> 01:24:22,324
What did I tell you?

1495
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:24,224
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1496
01:24:24,324 --> 01:24:26,224
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1497
01:24:26,624 --> 01:24:30,724
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1498
01:24:30,824 --> 01:24:34,724
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1499
01:24:34,824 --> 01:24:38,624
- People downtown said...
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1500
01:24:38,624 --> 01:24:40,724
Yes?

1501
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:42,824
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the...

1502
01:24:42,924 --> 01:24:45,725
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be...

1503
01:24:45,725 --> 01:24:48,325
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1504
01:24:48,425 --> 01:24:52,225
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1505
01:24:52,325 --> 01:24:54,425
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1506
01:24:54,525 --> 01:24:56,925
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1507
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,925
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John...

1508
01:24:58,925 --> 01:25:00,725
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1509
01:25:00,825 --> 01:25:02,725
- Mr. Williamson...
- The check was cashed.

1510
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:05,425
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1511
01:25:05,525 --> 01:25:07,925
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1512
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:12,125
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1513
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:14,925
- Though I'm sure we can...
- Not to my knowledge.

1514
01:25:15,025 --> 01:25:18,325
Christ! I...
Oh, Christ.

1515
01:25:18,425 --> 01:25:20,825
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1516
01:25:23,425 --> 01:25:26,025
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1517
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:29,425
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I...

1518
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:33,525
I don't...
I don't know anymore.

1519
01:25:35,025 --> 01:25:39,625
I... forgive me.

1520
01:25:53,525 --> 01:25:56,225
You stupid fucking cunt.

1521
01:25:57,625 --> 01:25:59,725
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1522
01:25:59,825 --> 01:26:02,525
You just cost me
$6,000.

1523
01:26:02,525 --> 01:26:09,125
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1524
01:26:09,225 --> 01:26:11,525
What are you gonna
do about it?

1525
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:16,125
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1526
01:26:16,225 --> 01:26:18,125
You're fucking shit.

1527
01:26:18,225 --> 01:26:20,625
Where did you
learn your trade,

1528
01:26:20,725 --> 01:26:23,525
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1529
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:26,025
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1530
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:27,525
Could I?

1531
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:30,025
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1532
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,825
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1533
01:26:32,925 --> 01:26:36,925
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1534
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,025
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1535
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:42,425
you're going out.
I swear to you...

1536
01:26:42,525 --> 01:26:45,125
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1537
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:50,625
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits...

1538
01:26:50,725 --> 01:26:53,425
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1539
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:59,825
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1540
01:26:59,925 --> 01:27:02,725
Does that seem
clear to you?

1541
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:07,625
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1542
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:10,926
To help men who are
going out there

1543
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:14,426
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1544
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:16,226
You company man.

1545
01:27:16,326 --> 01:27:19,326
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1546
01:27:19,426 --> 01:27:22,926
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1547
01:27:27,926 --> 01:27:30,226
You wanna learn
the first rule

1548
01:27:30,326 --> 01:27:33,326
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1549
01:27:33,426 --> 01:27:38,826
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1550
01:27:40,626 --> 01:27:43,326
You fucking child.

1551
01:27:55,626 --> 01:27:58,726
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1552
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:03,726
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1553
01:28:03,726 --> 01:28:06,926
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1554
01:28:07,026 --> 01:28:08,826
Yes, I hear you.

1555
01:28:08,926 --> 01:28:12,026
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1556
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:14,326
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1557
01:28:14,426 --> 01:28:16,326
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1558
01:28:16,426 --> 01:28:19,726
Precisely.
Because your partner depends...

1559
01:28:19,826 --> 01:28:21,726
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1560
01:28:21,826 --> 01:28:22,926
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1561
01:28:22,926 --> 01:28:25,426
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1562
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:28,826
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1563
01:28:28,826 --> 01:28:31,126
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1564
01:28:31,226 --> 01:28:32,926
"Hey, maybe the guy..."
oh, fuck it.

1565
01:28:32,926 --> 01:28:35,926
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1566
01:28:36,026 --> 01:28:38,626
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1567
01:28:38,626 --> 01:28:41,626
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1568
01:28:41,726 --> 01:28:43,926
You are shit...
you can't exist alone.

1569
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:45,826
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1570
01:28:45,926 --> 01:28:49,026
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1571
01:28:49,126 --> 01:28:51,226
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1572
01:28:51,226 --> 01:28:53,326
because you didn't
know the shot.

1573
01:28:53,426 --> 01:28:55,726
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1574
01:28:55,726 --> 01:28:58,726
I don't know what...
if you can't take something from that,

1575
01:28:58,826 --> 01:29:01,626
then you're... scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1576
01:29:01,726 --> 01:29:04,726
A child would know it,
he's right.

1577
01:29:04,926 --> 01:29:08,126
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1578
01:29:08,126 --> 01:29:11,126
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1579
01:29:11,226 --> 01:29:13,926
I'm done with you.

1580
01:29:26,526 --> 01:29:28,126
How do you know
I made it up?

1581
01:29:28,226 --> 01:29:30,526
What?

1582
01:29:30,626 --> 01:29:33,526
How do you know
I made it up?

1583
01:29:33,626 --> 01:29:36,127
What are you
talking about, huh?

1584
01:29:38,827 --> 01:29:41,827
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1585
01:29:43,927 --> 01:29:48,527
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1586
01:29:55,827 --> 01:29:58,627
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1587
01:29:58,627 --> 01:30:00,827
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1588
01:30:04,627 --> 01:30:06,527
No, it hadn't.

1589
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:10,827
Don't fuck with me.

1590
01:30:10,827 --> 01:30:13,327
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1591
01:30:13,327 --> 01:30:16,127
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1592
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:21,327
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1593
01:30:21,427 --> 01:30:23,627
last night I didn't.

1594
01:30:25,027 --> 01:30:28,127
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1595
01:30:30,227 --> 01:30:32,627
How did you know that?

1596
01:30:34,527 --> 01:30:39,427
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1597
01:30:39,527 --> 01:30:41,927
No one knew that but you.

1598
01:30:43,227 --> 01:30:44,927
Now, how did you know that?

1599
01:30:45,027 --> 01:30:48,627
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1600
01:30:48,727 --> 01:30:50,127
Because this is my job!

1601
01:30:50,227 --> 01:30:54,127
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1602
01:30:54,127 --> 01:30:57,127
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1603
01:30:57,227 --> 01:30:59,827
You are so full of shit!

1604
01:30:59,927 --> 01:31:02,227
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1605
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:04,427
Oh sure! You asshole.

1606
01:31:04,527 --> 01:31:06,327
What did you do
with the leads?

1607
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:09,127
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1608
01:31:09,127 --> 01:31:11,827
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1609
01:31:11,927 --> 01:31:15,327
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1610
01:31:15,327 --> 01:31:18,527
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1611
01:31:18,627 --> 01:31:20,927
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1612
01:31:21,027 --> 01:31:23,327
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1613
01:31:23,427 --> 01:31:25,827
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1614
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:29,027
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1615
01:31:29,127 --> 01:31:30,527
Now, where are the leads?

1616
01:31:30,627 --> 01:31:32,627
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1617
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:34,327
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1618
01:31:34,427 --> 01:31:36,927
I don't care,
you understand?

1619
01:31:38,127 --> 01:31:40,727
Where are the leads?

1620
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:44,227
All right.

1621
01:31:46,127 --> 01:31:48,127
I sold them.

1622
01:31:57,027 --> 01:31:59,527
To Jerry Graff.

1623
01:31:59,627 --> 01:32:01,928
How much did you
get for them?

1624
01:32:02,028 --> 01:32:03,828
How much did
you get for them?

1625
01:32:03,928 --> 01:32:06,328
Five.
Five grand.

1626
01:32:06,328 --> 01:32:09,228
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1627
01:32:09,328 --> 01:32:11,228
Do I have to tell you?

1628
01:32:11,328 --> 01:32:13,928
Moss.

1629
01:32:17,528 --> 01:32:19,528
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1630
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:22,128
- His idea.
- Was it?

1631
01:32:22,228 --> 01:32:24,428
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1632
01:32:24,528 --> 01:32:27,828
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1633
01:32:27,928 --> 01:32:30,128
Mmm.

1634
01:32:31,728 --> 01:32:33,328
Wait a minute.
Okay... hey, hey, John!

1635
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:36,628
Wait... okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1636
01:32:36,728 --> 01:32:40,228
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1637
01:32:42,428 --> 01:32:44,128
Eh, John?

1638
01:32:44,228 --> 01:32:46,428
Last night...

1639
01:32:46,528 --> 01:32:49,228
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1640
01:32:49,228 --> 01:32:52,228
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1641
01:32:52,228 --> 01:32:55,528
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1642
01:32:55,628 --> 01:32:59,728
Hey... put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1643
01:32:59,828 --> 01:33:02,328
What it taught me...
you gotta get out there!

1644
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:05,728
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1645
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:08,628
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1646
01:33:08,728 --> 01:33:12,628
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1647
01:33:12,728 --> 01:33:15,328
But whatever it takes, John,

1648
01:33:15,428 --> 01:33:17,928
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1649
01:33:18,028 --> 01:33:20,628
We are going
to make it right.

1650
01:33:24,028 --> 01:33:25,828
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1651
01:33:25,828 --> 01:33:29,528
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1652
01:33:29,628 --> 01:33:32,128
What?

1653
01:33:32,228 --> 01:33:33,928
You've got a big mouth!

1654
01:33:33,928 --> 01:33:36,728
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1655
01:33:36,728 --> 01:33:38,628
Where are you going?

1656
01:33:38,728 --> 01:33:41,428
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1657
01:33:41,528 --> 01:33:43,728
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1658
01:33:45,528 --> 01:33:49,028
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1659
01:33:49,128 --> 01:33:51,428
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1660
01:33:51,528 --> 01:33:54,428
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1661
01:33:54,528 --> 01:33:58,428
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take...

1662
01:33:58,528 --> 01:34:01,928
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1663
01:34:02,028 --> 01:34:04,328
Wait, John.

1664
01:34:04,328 --> 01:34:07,828
John... okay.

1665
01:34:10,628 --> 01:34:15,028
This is what
we're gonna do... 20%.

1666
01:34:15,128 --> 01:34:18,328
I'm gonna give you 20%
of all my sales.

1667
01:34:18,428 --> 01:34:21,328
20%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1668
01:34:21,428 --> 01:34:23,428
50.

1669
01:34:23,528 --> 01:34:27,929
- 50% of all my sales.
- What sales?

1670
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:30,229
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1671
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:33,429
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1672
01:34:33,429 --> 01:34:35,929
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1673
01:34:36,029 --> 01:34:38,929
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg...
do you want to see the memos?

1674
01:34:39,029 --> 01:34:42,629
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week...

1675
01:34:42,729 --> 01:34:45,229
when I was with Webb...
we were selling Arizona.

1676
01:34:45,329 --> 01:34:47,329
They're nuts.

1677
01:34:47,429 --> 01:34:52,829
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1678
01:34:52,929 --> 01:34:54,829
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1679
01:34:54,929 --> 01:34:57,129
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1680
01:34:57,229 --> 01:34:59,529
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1681
01:34:59,629 --> 01:35:01,529
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1682
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:03,429
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1683
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:07,129
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1684
01:35:07,229 --> 01:35:10,029
The people are insane.

1685
01:35:11,429 --> 01:35:14,929
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1686
01:35:19,929 --> 01:35:24,129
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1687
01:35:26,729 --> 01:35:30,729
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1688
01:35:37,429 --> 01:35:39,429
My daughter.

1689
01:35:39,529 --> 01:35:41,729
Fuck you.

1690
01:35:56,929 --> 01:35:59,329
Asshole.

1691
01:35:59,329 --> 01:36:02,529
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1692
01:36:04,729 --> 01:36:07,129
What a day.

1693
01:36:07,129 --> 01:36:09,129
Whoo...

1694
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:11,729
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1695
01:36:15,229 --> 01:36:18,929
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1696
01:36:21,429 --> 01:36:25,029
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1697
01:36:27,529 --> 01:36:30,229
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1698
01:36:30,329 --> 01:36:33,129
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1699
01:36:33,129 --> 01:36:35,729
bureaucrats...

1700
01:36:35,829 --> 01:36:38,629
officeholders, what it is.

1701
01:36:39,629 --> 01:36:41,929
It's a fucked-up world.

1702
01:36:44,329 --> 01:36:46,229
No adventure to it.

1703
01:36:46,329 --> 01:36:50,629
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1704
01:36:52,329 --> 01:36:56,030
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's... that's...

1705
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:59,830
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1706
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:02,330
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1707
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:04,630
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time...

1708
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:08,630
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"...

1709
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:12,130
there's a man
I would work with.

1710
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:15,930
There's..." you know,
I never said a word.

1711
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:18,930
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1712
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:22,830
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today...

1713
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:27,030
that was so good.
That... it...

1714
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,930
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1715
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:32,530
That was admirable.

1716
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:35,330
It was the old stuff.

1717
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:38,930
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1718
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:42,730
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1719
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:47,030
- You eat today?
- Me?

1720
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:48,630
Yeah.

1721
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:52,030
Want to swing around the Chinks'...
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1722
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:54,430
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1723
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,430
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1724
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,630
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1725
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:01,630
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1726
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:04,330
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1727
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:06,630
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1728
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:09,130
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1729
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:13,030
- Mr. Levene?
...so I only have that one lot left.

1730
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:14,930
Would you come in here,
please?

1731
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:17,330
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1732
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:19,830
so if you or your husband
are truly interested...

1733
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:22,430
because I can't hold
this parcel past...

1734
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,930
Yes?

1735
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:28,030
Well, what would be better
for you... say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1736
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:33,530
Go ask him. Shel... we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1737
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:35,530
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1738
01:38:35,630 --> 01:38:37,730
- I...
- Get in the room.

1739
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:41,730
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1740
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:44,830
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1741
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:47,230
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1742
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:49,530
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky...

1743
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:51,430
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is...

1744
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:53,530
What do you want?
You want to what?

1745
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:57,530
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1746
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:03,830
8:00 P.M.
6947 Euclid.

1747
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:06,630
Not at all...
thank you very much.

1748
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:20,531
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1749
01:39:20,631 --> 01:39:23,731
No. I don't know.

1750
01:39:28,631 --> 01:39:30,731
Did the leads
come in yet?

1751
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:33,231
No.

1752
01:39:41,131 --> 01:39:43,431
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1753
01:39:43,431 --> 01:39:45,531
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1754
01:39:51,131 --> 01:39:53,931
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1755
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:57,231
Yes... you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?

1756
01:39:57,531 --> 01:40:02,231
# Blue skies smiling at me #

1757
01:40:02,231 --> 01:40:07,531
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1758
01:40:07,631 --> 01:40:10,631
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1759
01:40:10,731 --> 01:40:13,631
# Singing a song #

1760
01:40:13,731 --> 01:40:16,631
# Nothing but bluebirds #

1761
01:40:16,731 --> 01:40:19,631
# From now on #

1762
01:40:19,731 --> 01:40:22,831
# I never saw the sun
shining so bright #

1763
01:40:22,931 --> 01:40:25,631
# Never saw things
going so right #

1764
01:40:25,731 --> 01:40:28,631
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1765
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:32,131
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1766
01:40:32,231 --> 01:40:36,631
# Blue days,
all of them gone #

1767
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:41,731
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on... #

1768
01:41:27,031 --> 01:41:31,631
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1769
01:41:31,731 --> 01:41:37,331
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1770
01:41:37,431 --> 01:41:39,831
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1771
01:41:39,831 --> 01:41:42,931
# Singing a song #

1772
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:47,832
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1773
01:41:47,932 --> 01:41:50,332
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1774
01:41:50,332 --> 01:41:51,932
# Shining so bright #

1775
01:41:52,032 --> 01:41:54,832
# Never saw things
going so right #

1776
01:41:54,932 --> 01:41:57,632
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1777
01:41:57,732 --> 01:42:00,732
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1778
01:42:00,832 --> 01:42:05,432
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1779
01:42:05,532 --> 01:42:10,732
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1780
01:42:10,832 --> 01:42:13,032
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1781
01:42:13,032 --> 01:42:16,432
# Singing a song #

1782
01:42:16,532 --> 01:42:21,332
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1783
01:42:21,332 --> 01:42:23,732
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1784
01:42:23,832 --> 01:42:25,532
# Shining so bright #

1785
01:42:25,632 --> 01:42:28,132
# Never saw things
going so right #

1786
01:42:28,232 --> 01:42:31,132
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1787
01:42:31,232 --> 01:42:33,832
# When you're in love,
my how they fly #

1788
01:42:33,932 --> 01:42:36,932
# Blue days #

1789
01:42:37,032 --> 01:42:39,532
# All of them,
all of them gone #

1790
01:42:39,532 --> 01:42:44,332
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1791
01:42:44,432 --> 01:42:49,932
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1792
01:42:49,932 --> 01:42:55,732
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1793
01:42:55,732 --> 01:42:58,632
# Now on #

1794
01:42:58,632 --> 01:43:06,832
# Nothing but blue skies. #
