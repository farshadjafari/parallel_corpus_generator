2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,529
Okay, on your toes, men.

3
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,072
Hi-ho, silver!

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,900
Hey, we got to save Olive Oyl!

5
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,501
Whoo-whoo! Whoo! Waah! Waah!

6
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,204
Hail, Rome!

7
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,911
Victorious...
in thy mourning weeds!

8
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,623
Lo, as the bark that hath
discharged her freight...

9
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,128
returns with precious
lading to the bay...

10
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,177
from whence at first
she weighed her Anchorage,

11
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,882
cometh Andronicus,
bound with laurel boughs,

12
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,343
to re-salute his country
with his tears.

13
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,432
Stand gracious to the rites
that we intend!

14
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,980
Romans,
of five and 20 valiant sons,

15
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:22,114
behold the poor remains,
alive and dead.

16
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:26,447
These that survive,
let Rome reward with love.

17
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,032
These that I bring
unto their latest home...

18
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,289
with burial amongst
their ancestors.

19
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,966
Here Goths have given me leave
to sheathe my sword.

20
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,976
Titus, unkind and careless
of thine own,

21
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,064
why suffer'st thou thy sons,
unburied yet,

22
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,484
to hover on the dreadful
shore of Styx?

23
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,205
Make way to lay them
by their brethren!

24
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,329
O sacred receptacle of my joys,

25
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,157
sweet cell of virtue
and nobility,

26
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,375
how many sons of mine
hast thou in store...

27
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,128
that thou wilt never
render to me more?

28
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,947
And there greet in silence,
as the dead are wont,

29
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,404
and sleep in peace,

30
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,831
slain in your country's wars.

31
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,213
Give us the proudest
prisoner of the Goths...

32
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,390
that we may hew his limbs,
and on a pile-

33
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,308
Ad manes fiatrum.

34
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,977
Sacrifice his flesh.

35
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,146
That so the shadows
be not unappeased,

36
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,724
nor we disturbed
with prodigies on earth.

37
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,812
I give him you,
the noblest that survives:

38
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,443
the eldest son
of this distressed queen.

39
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:52,244
No! Stay, Roman brethren!

40
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,661
Gracious conqueror,

41
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:58,537
victorious Titus,
rue the tears I shed-

42
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,335
the mother's tears
in passion for her son.

43
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,254
No!

44
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,627
If thy sons were
ever dear to thee,

45
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,337
oh, think my son to be
as dear to me.

46
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,263
Sufficeth not that
we are brought to Rome...

47
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,137
to beautify your triumphs
and return,

48
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,560
captive to thee
and thy Roman yoke?

49
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:22,516
But must my sons
be slaughtered in the streets...

50
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,978
for valiant doings
in their country's cause?

51
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,610
Oh, if to fight for king and
commonweal were piety in thine,

52
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,612
it is in these.

53
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,364
Andronicus,

54
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,449
stain not thy tomb with blood.

55
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,411
Wilt thou draw near
the nature of the gods?

56
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:46,339
Draw near them then
in being merciful.

57
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,634
Sweet mercy
is nobility's true badge.

58
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,888
Thrice noble Titus-

59
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,143
Spare my first-born son.

60
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,564
Patient yourself, madam,
and pardon me.

61
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,563
These are their brethren,
whom your Goths beheld...

62
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,144
alive and dead,

63
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,070
and for their brethren slain,

64
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,115
religiously they ask a sacrifice.

65
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,409
To this your son is marked-

66
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,952
Oh!

67
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,032
And die he must to appease
their groaning shadows that are gone.

68
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,084
Away with him and
make a fire straight.

69
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,412
And with our swords,
upon a pile of wood...

70
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,466
let's hew his limbs
till they be clean consumed.

71
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,137
O cruel, irreligious piety!

72
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,134
Was ever Scythia
half so barbarous?

73
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,095
Oppose not Scythia
to ambitious Rome.

74
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,179
Alarbus goes to rest,

75
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,688
and we survive to tremble
under Titus' threatening looks.

76
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,397
Stand resolved,

77
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
but hope withal the gods
may favor Tamora,

78
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,281
the Queen of Goths,

79
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,489
to quit these bloody wrongs
upon her foes.

80
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,803
See, lord and father, how we
have performed our Roman rites.

81
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,551
Alarbus' limbs are lopped,

82
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,304
and entrails feed
the sacrificing fire.

83
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,136
Remaineth not,
but to inter our brethren...

84
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,564
and with loud alarums
welcome them to Rome.

85
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,600
In peace and honor
rest you here, my sons,

86
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,105
secure from worldly
chances and mishaps.

87
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,362
Here lurks no treason.

88
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,191
Here no envy swells.

89
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,494
Here grow no damned drugs.

90
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,573
Here are no storms,

91
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,158
no noise,

92
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,085
but silence and eternal sleep.

93
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,291
In peace and honor
rest you here, my sons.

94
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,629
In peace and honor
live Lord Titus long.

95
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,058
My noble lord and father,
live in fame.

96
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,397
Lo, at this tomb
my tributary tears I render...

97
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,816
for my brethren's obsequies.

98
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:57,238
And at thy feet I kneel,
with tears of joy...

99
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,658
shed on the earth
for thy return to Rome.

100
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,368
Bless me here
with thy victorious hand.

101
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,827
Kind Rome, that hast
thus lovingly reserved...

102
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,504
the cordial of mine age
to glad my heart.

103
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,009
Lavinia, live.

104
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,800
Outlive thy father's days
and fame's eternal date,

105
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,976
for virtue's praise.

106
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:15,233
Noble patricians,
patrons of my right,

107
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:20,530
defend the justice
of my cause with arms!

108
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,984
And, countrymen,
my loving followers,

109
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,492
plead my successive title
with your swords!

110
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,997
Romans, friends, followers,
favorers of my right,

111
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,919
if ever Bassianus,
Caesar's son,

112
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,089
were gracious in the eyes
of royal Rome,

113
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:42,010
keep, then, this passage
to the capitol.

114
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,883
I am the first-born son!

115
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,559
That was the last that wear
the imperial diadem of Rome.

116
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:53,264
And suffer not dishonor
to approach the imperial seat:

117
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,099
to virtue, consecrate,

118
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,187
to justice, continence,
and nobility!

119
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,024
Then let my father's
honors live in me!

120
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:08,361
Nor wrong mine age
with this indignity!

121
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,369
But let desert
in pure election shine,

122
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,169
and, Romans, fight for
freedom in your choice.

123
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,759
Princes...

124
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,089
that strive by factions
and by friends ambitiously...

125
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,515
for rule and empery.

126
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,266
Know that the people of Rome
have by common voice...

127
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,690
in election for the Roman
empery chosen Andronicus.

128
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,108
A nobler man,

129
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,279
a braver warrior, lives not
this day within the city walls.

130
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,654
He by the senate is accited home
from weary wars...

131
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,656
against the barbarous Goths.

132
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,205
Let us entreat,
by honor of his name,

133
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,705
that you withdraw you,
dismiss your followers,

134
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,629
and, as suitors should,
plead your deserts in peace...

135
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,627
and humbleness.

136
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,208
Marcus Andronicus,

137
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,182
so I do rely on
thy uprightness and integrity,

138
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,845
and so I love and honor
thee and thine-

139
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,852
thy noble brother Titus
and his sons...

140
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,481
and her to whom my thoughts
are humbled all,

141
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,235
gracious Lavinia,
Rome's rich ornament-

142
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,863
that I will here dismiss
my loving friends.

143
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:18,329
And to my fortunes
and the people's favor,

144
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,833
commit my cause in balance
to be weighed.

145
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,384
Friends...

146
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,767
that have been thus
forward in my right,

147
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,060
I thank you all
and here dismiss you all.

148
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:49,898
And to the love and favor
of my country...

149
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,780
commit myself, my person,

150
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,279
and the cause!

151
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,412
Rome...

152
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,998
be as just
and gracious unto me...

153
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,880
as I am confident
and kind to thee.

154
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,508
Open the gates and let me in!

155
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,673
Long live Lord Titus,
my beloved brother.

156
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,002
Thanks, gentle tribune,

157
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,178
noble brother Marcus.

158
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,808
And welcome, nephews,
from successful wars,

159
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,763
you that survive
and those that sleep in fame.

160
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,939
Titus Andronicus,

161
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,233
the people of Rome
send thee by me,

162
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,811
their tribune and their trust,

163
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,943
this palliament of white
and spotless hue,

164
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,117
and name thee in election
for the empire...

165
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,366
with these our late-deceased
emperor's sons.

166
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,664
Be candidatus, then,

167
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,787
and put it on,

168
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,871
and help to set a head
on headless Rome.

169
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,001
A better head
her glorious body fits...

170
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,924
than this that shakes
for age and feebleness.

171
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,636
Rome, I have been
thy soldier 40 years...

172
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,815
and led my country's
strength successfully...

173
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,609
and buried one and 20
valiant sons.

174
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,483
Give me a staff of honor
for mine age,

175
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,656
but not a scepter
to control the world.

176
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,076
Upright he held it, lords,
that held it last.

177
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,574
Titus, thou shalt but ask
and have the empery.

178
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,577
Proud and ambitious tribune,
canst thou tell?

179
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,324
Patience, Prince Saturnine.
Romans!

180
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,954
Do me right!

181
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,877
Patricians, draw your swords
and sheathe them not...

182
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,331
till Saturninus
be Rome's emperor!

183
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,461
Andronicus, would thou
wert shipped to hell...

184
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,418
rather than rob me
of the people's hearts!

185
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,424
Proud Saturnine,
interrupter of the good,

186
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,346
that noble-minded Titus
means to thee.

187
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,890
Content thee, prince.

188
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,889
I will restore to thee
the people's hearts...

189
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,096
and wean them from themselves.

190
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,315
Andronicus,

191
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,196
I do not flatter thee
but honor thee,

192
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,868
and will do till I die.

193
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,537
My faction, if thou strengthen
with thy friends,

194
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,910
I will most thankful be.

195
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,210
People of Rome
and people's tribunes here,

196
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,884
I ask your voices
and your suffrages.

197
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,382
Will you bestow them
friendly on Andronicus?

198
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,679
To gratify the good Andronicus...

199
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,105
and gratulate
his safe return to Rome,

200
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,228
the people will accept
whom he admits.

201
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,733
Tribunes, I thank you,
and this suit I make...

202
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,065
that you create
your emperor's eldest son,

203
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,822
Lord Saturnine,
whose virtues will, I hope,

204
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,620
reflect on Rome
as Titan's rays on earth.

205
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,915
And if you will elect
by my advice,

206
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,833
crown him and say,

207
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,458
"Long live our emperor!"

208
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,631
Long live
our emperor Saturnine!

209
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,771
Patricians and plebeians,

210
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,322
we create Lord Saturninus
Rome's great emperor...

211
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:04,868
and say, "Long live
our Emperor Saturnine!"

212
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,136
Titus Andronicus,

213
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,932
for thy favors done to us
in our election this day,

214
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:30,557
I give thee thanks
in part of thy deserts...

215
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,561
and will with deeds
requite thy gentleness.

216
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,651
And, for an onset, Titus,

217
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:45,075
to advance thy name
and honorable family,

218
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,495
Lavinia will I make my empress,

219
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,323
Rome's royal mistress,

220
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,331
mistress of my heart-

221
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,706
And in the sacred pantheon
her espouse.

222
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,593
Tell me, Andronicus,
doth this motion please thee?

223
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,049
Hmm?

224
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,009
It doth, my worthy lord,

225
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,392
and in this match I hold me
highly honored of your grace.

226
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,594
And here, in sight of Rome,

227
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,468
to Saturnine, king and
commander of our commonweal,

228
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,220
the wide world's emperor,

229
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,725
do I consecrate my sword,
my chariot, and my prisoners:

230
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,477
presents well worthy
Rome's imperial lord.

231
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,906
Thanks, noble Titus,

232
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,734
father of my life.

233
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,912
How proud I am of thee
and of thy gifts...

234
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,240
Rome shall record.

235
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:20,501
And when I do forget the least
of these unspeakable deserts,

236
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,753
Romans,
forget thy fealty to me.

237
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,585
Now, madam, are you
prisoner to an emperor-

238
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,171
to him that, for your honor
and your state,

239
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,428
will use you nobly
and your followers.

240
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,101
Mmm.

241
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,100
A goodly lady.

242
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,649
Trust me, of the hue
that I would choose,

243
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,523
were I to choose anew.

244
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,950
Clear up, fair queen,
that cloudy countenance.

245
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,120
Though chance of war
hath wrought this change of cheer,

246
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,495
thou comest not to be made
a scorn in Rome.

247
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,373
Princely shall be thy usage...

248
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,454
every Way-

249
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,381
Rest on my word,

250
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:09,212
and let not discontent
daunt all your hopes.

251
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,758
Madam, he that comforts you...

252
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,970
can make you greater
than Queen of Goths.

253
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,608
Lavinia, you are not
displeased with this?

254
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,356
Not I, my Lord,

255
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,778
sith true nobility
warrants these words...

256
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,607
in princely courtesy.

257
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,567
Thanks, sweet Lavinia.

258
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,324
Romans, let us go!

259
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,249
Ransomless here
we set our prisoners free.

260
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,702
Proclaim our honors, lords,
with trump and drum.

261
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,942
Lord Titus, by your leave,
this maid is mine.

262
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,400
How, sir! Are you
in earnest, then, my lord?

263
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,576
Ay, noble Titus,
and resolved withal.

264
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,029
This prince in justice
seizeth but his own.

265
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,956
And that he will and shall,
if Lucius live.

266
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,751
Traitors, avaunt!

267
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,457
Where is the emperor's guard?

268
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,634
Treason, my lord,
Lavinia is surprised!

269
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,800
Surprised? By whom?

270
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:38,305
By him that justly may bear his
betrothed from all the world away.

271
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,305
Fear not, my lord,
I'll soon bring her back.

272
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,652
Brothers, help to convey
her hence away!

273
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,154
And with my sword
I'll keep this way safe.

274
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,408
My lord, you pass not here.

275
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,364
What, villain boy?

276
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,575
Barr'st me my way in Rome, huh?

277
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,456
Help! Lucius!

278
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,432
My lord! You are unjust!

279
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,481
And more than so,

280
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,525
in wrongful quarrel,
you have slain your son.

281
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,945
Nor thou nor he
are any sons of mine.

282
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,773
My sons would never
so dishonor me.

283
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,608
Traitor!

284
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,114
Restore Lavinia to the emperor.

285
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:42,539
Dead, if you will,
but not to be his wife...

286
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,914
that is another's lawful
promised love.

287
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,231
No, Titus, no!

288
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,309
The emperor needs her not!

289
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,987
Nor her, nor thee,
nor any of thy stock!

290
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,363
I will trust, by leisure,
him that mocks me once.

291
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,695
Thee never!

292
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,575
Nor thy traitorous,
haughty sons,

293
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,577
confederates all,
thus to dishonor me.

294
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,203
But go thy ways. Go!

295
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,998
A valiant son-in-law
shalt thou enjoy,

296
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,172
one fit to bandy
with thy lawless sons!

297
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,672
And therefore, lovely Tamora,

298
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,174
Queen of Goths,

299
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:42,599
if thou be pleased
with this my sudden choice,

300
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,302
behold.

301
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,983
I choose thee, Tamora,
for my bride...

302
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,278
and will create thee
empress of Rome.

303
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,243
Speak, Queen of Goths.
Dost thou applaud my choice?

304
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,584
If Saturnine advance
the Queen of Goths,

305
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,787
she will a handmaid be
to his desires,

306
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,215
a loving nurse,
a mother to his youth.

307
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,965
Ascend, fair queen,
to the pantheon.

308
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:23,140
Lords, accompany
your noble emperor...

309
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,217
and his lovely bride.

310
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,975
There shall we consummate
our spousal rites.

311
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:42,193
Titus, when wen
thou wont to walk alone,

312
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,495
dishonored thus
and challenged of wrongs?

313
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,924
O Titus, see.

314
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,759
Oh, see what thou hast done-

315
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,518
in a bad quarrel
slain a virtuous son.

316
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,599
No, foolish tribune, no.

317
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,732
No son of mine,
nor thou, nor these,

318
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,281
confederates in the deed that
hath dishonored all our family.

319
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,575
But let us give him
burial as becomes.

320
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,778
Give Mutius burial
with our brethren.

321
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,617
Traitors, away.
He rests not in this tomb.

322
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:35,125
Here none but soldiers and
Rome's servitors repose in fame-

323
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,797
none basely slain in brawls.

324
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,298
Bury him where you can.
He comes not here.

325
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,504
My lord,
this is impiety in you.

326
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,339
He must be buried
with his brethren.

327
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,891
And shall, or him
we will accompany!

328
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,515
And shall?

329
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,471
What villain was it
spake that word?

330
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,898
He that would vouch it
in any place but here.

331
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,652
What, would you bury him
in my despite?

332
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,402
No, noble Titus,

333
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,906
but entreat of thee to pardon
Mutius and to bury him.

334
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,864
Marcus, even thou has
struck upon my crest...

335
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,324
and, with these boys,

336
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,707
mine honor thou hast wounded.

337
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,712
My foes I do repute you
every one,

338
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,044
so trouble me no more,
but get you gone.

339
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,638
He is not with himself.
Let us withdraw.

340
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,563
Not I, till Mutius'
bones be buried.

341
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,112
Father, and in that name
doth nature speak,

342
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,942
dear father, soul
and substance of us all.

343
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,026
Renowned Titus,
more than half my soul.

344
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,282
Rise, Marcus, rise.

345
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,788
The dismall'st day is this
that e'er I saw,

346
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,125
to be dishonored
by my sons in Rome.

347
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,959
Well, bury him!

348
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,794
And bury me the next.

349
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,573
I'll have another.

350
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,264
Ah!

351
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:00,974
So, Bassianus,
you have played your prize.

352
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,556
God give you joy, sir,
of your gallant bride.

353
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,983
And you of yours, my lord.

354
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,902
I say no more nor wish no
less, and so I take my leave.

355
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,153
Traitor!

356
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,237
If Rome have law
or we have power,

357
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,243
thou and thy faction
shall repent this rape.

358
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,040
Rape call you it, my lord,

359
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,586
to seize my own, my true-betrothed
love, and now my wife?

360
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,504
But let the laws of Rome
determine all.

361
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,503
Meanwhile, I am possessed
of that is mine.

362
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:35,004
'Tis good, sir.
You are very short with us.

363
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,807
But if we live,
we'll be as sharp with you.

364
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,010
My lord, what I have done,
as best I may,

365
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,971
answer I must
and shall do with my life.

366
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,316
This noble gentleman-
Lord Titus here-

367
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,439
is in opinion
and in honor wronged.

368
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,613
That in the rescue of Lavinia,
with his own hand,

369
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,111
did slay his youngest son
in zeal to you.

370
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,283
Hmm.

371
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,360
Receive him then to favor,
Saturnine.

372
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,790
Prince Bassianus,
leave to plead my deeds.

373
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,460
'Tis thou and those
that have dishonored me.

374
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,085
Rome and the righteous heavens
be my judge...

375
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,838
how I have loved
and honored Saturnine.

376
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,835
I can do no more.
Patience, Bassianus.

377
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:19,594
My worthy lord, if ever
Tamora were gracious...

378
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,721
in those princely eyes
of thine,

379
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,975
then hear me speak indifferently for all.

380
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:30,981
And at my suit, sweet,
pardon what is past.

381
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,187
Oh, madam?
Be dishonored openly...

382
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,896
and basely put it up
without revenge?

383
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,481
Not so, my lord.

384
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,865
The gods of Rome forfend
I should be author to dishonor you.

385
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,665
But on mine honor
dare I undertake...

386
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,242
for good Lord Titus'
innocence in all,

387
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:52,582
whose fury, not dissembled,
speaks his griefs.

388
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:56,419
Then at my suit
look graciously on him.

389
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,926
Lose not so noble a friend
on vain suppose.

390
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,969
My lord, be ruled by me.

391
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,644
Be won at last.

392
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,064
Dissemble all your griefs
and discontents.

393
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,359
You are but newly planted
in your throne.

394
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,402
Lest then the people
and patricians, too,

395
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,072
upon a just survey,
take Titus' part...

396
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,276
and so supplant you
for ingratitude.

397
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,035
Yield at entreats,
and then let me alone.

398
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,336
I'll find a day
to massacre them all...

399
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,210
and raze their faction
and their family-

400
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,508
the cruel father
and his traitorous sons...

401
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:41,259
to whom I sued
for my dear son's life,

402
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:45,467
and make them know what 'tis
to let a queen kneel in the streets...

403
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,724
and beg for grace in vain.

404
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:53,400
Come, come, sweet emperor.

405
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,067
Come, Andronicus.

406
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,113
Take up this good old man,
and cheer the heart...

407
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,942
that dies in tempest
of thy angry frown.

408
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,748
Rise, Titus, rise.
My empress hath prevailed.

409
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,327
I thank your majesty
and her, my lord.

410
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,300
And let it be mine honor,
good my lord,

411
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,254
that I have reconciled
your friends and you.

412
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,260
For you, Prince Bassianus,

413
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,888
I have passed my word and
promise to the emperor...

414
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,560
that you will be
more mild and tractable.

415
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,936
And fear not, lords,
and you, Lavinia.

416
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:37,770
By my advice,
all humbled on your knees,

417
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,197
you shall ask pardon
of his majesty.

418
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,955
We do, and vow to heaven
and to your highness...

419
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,783
that what we did
was mildly as we might,

420
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,119
tendering our sister's honor
and our own.

421
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,796
That, on mine honor,
here I do attest.

422
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,839
Away, and talk not.
Trouble us no more.

423
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,840
Nay, nay, sweet emperor.
We must all be friends.

424
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,595
The tribune and his nephews
kneel for grace.

425
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,803
I will not be denied.

426
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:16,062
Sweetheart, look back.

427
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:24,779
Marcus, for thy sake
and thy brother's here,

428
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,282
and at my lovely Tamora's
entreats,

429
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:32,161
I do remit these young men's
heinous faults.

430
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,913
Stand up.

431
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:39,294
Lavinia, though you left me
like a churl,

432
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,795
I found a friend.

433
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,126
Come.

434
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,587
If the emperor's court
can feast two brides,

435
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,265
you are my guest, Lavinia,
and your friends.

436
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,437
This day shall be
a love-day, Tamora.

437
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,442
Tomorrow, an it please
your majesty,

438
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,195
to hunt the panther
and the hart with me.

439
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,778
Be it so, Titus,
and Gramercy too.

440
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:52,533
Now climbeth
Tamora Olympus' top,

441
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,582
safe out of fortune's shot
and sits aloft,

442
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,751
secure of thunder's crack
or lightning flash,

443
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,330
advanced above pale envy's
threatening reach.

444
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,251
As when the golden sun
salutes the morn...

445
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,463
and, having gilt the ocean
with his beams,

446
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,923
gallops the zodiac
in his glistering coach...

447
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,759
and overlooks
the highest peering hills.

448
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,102
So Tamora.

449
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,061
Upon her wit
doth earthly honor wait,

450
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:29,445
and virtue stoops
and trembles at her frown.

451
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,447
Then, Aaron,

452
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,405
arm thy heart
and fit thy thoughts...

453
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:39,288
to mount aloft
with thy imperial mistress...

454
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,836
and mount her pitch,
whom thou in triumph...

455
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:46,382
long hast a prisoner held
fettered in amorous chains.

456
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,303
Away with slavish weeds
and servile thoughts.

457
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,131
I will be bright
and shine in pearl and gold...

458
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,808
to wait upon
this new-made empress.

459
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:01,265
To wait, said I?

460
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,601
To wanton with this queen,
this goddess,

461
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,688
this Semiramis, this nymph,

462
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,649
this siren that will charm
Rome's Saturnine...

463
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,361
and see his shipwreck
and his commonweal's.

464
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,242
Holloa!

465
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,990
What storm is this?
Away!

466
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,833
Chiron, thy years wants wit.

467
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,883
Thy wit wants edge
and manners...

468
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,677
to intrude where I am graced,

469
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,346
and may, for aught
thou knowest, affected be.

470
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,096
Demetrius, thou dost
overween in all,

471
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,724
and so in this, to bear
me down with braves.

472
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,054
Aw!

473
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,105
'Tis not the difference
of a year or two...

474
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:46,060
makes me less gracious
or thee more fortunate.

475
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:49,021
I am as able and as fit
as thou to serve...

476
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,401
and to deserve
my mistress' grace.

477
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,653
That my sword upon thee
shall approve...

478
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,452
and plead my passions
for Lavinia's love.

479
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,531
Clubs, clubs! These lovers
will not keep the peace.

480
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,707
Why, boy, although our
mother, unadvised,

481
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,038
gave you a dancing rapier
by your side,

482
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,874
are you so desperate grown
to threat your friends?

483
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,379
Go to.

484
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,302
Have your lath glued
within your sheath...

485
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,095
till you know better
how to handle it.

486
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,390
Meanwhile, sir,

487
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:20,059
with what little skill I have,

488
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,887
full well thou shalt
perceive how much I dare.

489
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,322
Ay, boy.

490
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,826
Grow ye so brave?

491
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,659
How now, lords!

492
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,744
Here in the emperor's palace
dare you draw...

493
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,001
and maintain
such a quarrel openly?

494
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,504
Full well I wot the ground
of all this grudge.

495
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,130
I would not
for a million of gold...

496
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,178
the cause were known to them
it most concerns,

497
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,972
nor would your noble mother
for much more...

498
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,141
be so dishonored
in the court of Rome.

499
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,968
- For shame, put up.
- Not I!

500
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,645
Till I have sheathed
my rapier in his bosom...

501
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,189
and withal thrust these reproachful
speeches down his throat...

502
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,017
that he hath breathed
in my dishonor here.

503
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,651
For that I am
prepared and full resolved.

504
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,278
Foul-spoken coward,

505
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,984
that thunderest
with thy tongue...

506
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,240
and with thy weapon
nothing darest perform.

507
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,414
Away, I say! Now, by the gods
that warlike Goths adore,

508
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,912
this petty brabble
will undo us all.

509
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,211
Why, lords, think you not
how dangerous it is...

510
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,163
to step upon a prince's right?

511
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,340
What, is Lavinia
then become so loose...

512
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,884
or Bassianus so degenerate
that for her love...

513
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,428
such quarrels may be broached
without controlment,

514
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,176
justice, or revenge?

515
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,802
Young lords, beware!

516
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,556
And should the empress know this discord's
ground, the music would not please.

517
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,890
I care not, I, knew she
and all the world.

518
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,898
I love Lavinia more
than all the world!

519
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,902
Youngling, learn thou to make
some meaner choice.

520
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,825
Lavinia is thine
elder brother's hope.

521
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,449
Why, are ye mad?

522
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,251
Or know ye not in Rome
how furious and impatient they be...

523
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,921
and cannot brook
competitors in love?

524
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,837
I tell you, lords,

525
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,510
you do but plot your deaths
by this device.

526
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:19,883
Aaron,

527
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,010
a thousand deaths
would I propose...

528
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,342
to achieve her whom I love.

529
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,978
To achieve her! How?

530
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,682
Why makest thou it so strange?

531
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:34,815
She's a woman,
and therefore may be wooed.

532
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,063
She's a woman.
Ah!

533
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:40,116
Therefore may be won.

534
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,569
She is Lavinia,

535
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,245
and therefore must be loved.

536
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,871
Why, then, it seems,
some certain snatch or so...

537
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,421
would serve your turns.

538
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,795
Ay, so the turn were served.

539
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,842
Aaron, thou hast hit it.

540
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,135
Would you had hit it too.

541
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,135
Then should not we be tired
with this ado.

542
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,229
Are you such fools
to square for this?

543
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,476
Would it offend you then
that both should speed?

544
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,641
Faith, not me.

545
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,477
Nor me, so I were one.

546
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,190
For shame.
Be friends and join for that you jar.

547
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,492
'Tis policy and stratagem
must do that you affect.

548
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,744
And I have found the path.

549
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,459
My lords,

550
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,708
a solemn hunting is at hand.

551
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,467
There will the lovely
Roman ladies troop.

552
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,384
Ah, the forest walks
are wide and spacious,

553
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,431
and many unfrequented plots
there are...

554
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,353
fitted by kind
for rape and villainy.

555
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,653
Single you thither then
this dainty doe...

556
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:03,362
and strike her home by force,
if not by words.

557
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,661
This way, or not at all,
stand you in hope.

558
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,825
Come. Come. Our empress,
with her sacred wit,

559
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,626
will we acquaint with
all that we intend.

560
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,840
He that had wit
would think that I had none...

561
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,544
to bury so much gold
under a tree,

562
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,721
never after to inherit it.

563
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,721
Let him that thinks of me
so abjectly know...

564
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,599
that this gold must coin
a stratagem...

565
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,227
which, cunningly effected,

566
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,776
will beget a very excellent
piece of villainy.

567
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,987
And so repose, sweet gold,
for their unrest...

568
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,694
that have their alms
out of the empress' chest.

569
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,579
My lovely Aaron,

570
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,165
wherefore lookst thou sad...

571
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:46,094
when everything doth
make a gleeful boast?

572
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,138
The birds chant melody
on every bush.

573
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:54,059
The snake lies rolled...

574
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,136
in the cheerful sun.

575
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:02,105
The green leaves quiver
with the cooling wind.

576
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:08,366
Under their sweet shade,
Aaron, let us sit.

577
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,076
And after conflict, we may,

578
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,250
each wreathed
in the other's arms,

579
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,918
our pastimes done,

580
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,247
possess a golden slumber.

581
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,047
Whiles hounds and horns...

582
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:28,219
and sweet, melodious birds
be unto us...

583
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,262
as is a nurse's song
of lullaby...

584
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,556
to bring her babe asleep.

585
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,010
Madam, though Venus
govern your desires,

586
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,687
Saturn is dominator over mine.

587
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,730
What signifies
my deadly standing eye,

588
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,686
my silence,
and my cloudy melancholy?

589
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,443
No, madam, these are
no venereal signs.

590
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,737
Vengeance is in my heart,

591
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,914
death in my hand.

592
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,617
Blood and revenge are
hammering in my head.

593
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,756
Hark, Tamora,
the empress of my soul,

594
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,299
which never hopes
more heaven...

595
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,547
than rests in thee.

596
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,470
Hmm.

597
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,765
This is the day of
doom for Bassianus.

598
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,303
His Philomel must lose
her tongue today.

599
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,520
Thy sons make pillage
of her chastity...

600
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,478
and wash their hands
in Bassianus' blood.

601
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,572
Seest thou this letter?

602
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,577
Take it up, I pray thee, and give
the king this fatal-plotted scroll.

603
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,338
Question me no more.
We are espied.

604
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,172
Ah, my sweet Moor,
sweeter to me than life!

605
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,346
No more, great empress.
Bassianus comes.

606
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,140
Now, be cross with him,

607
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:00,060
and I'll go fetch thy sons
to back thy quarrels,

608
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,308
whatsoe'er they be.

609
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,108
Who have we here?

610
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,531
Rome's royal empress,

611
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,904
unfurnished of her
well-beseeming troop?

612
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:19,159
Or is it Dian,
habited like her,

613
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,740
who hath abandoned
her holy groves...

614
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,201
to see the general hunting
in this forest?

615
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,253
Saucy controller
of our private steps!

616
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,456
Had I the power
some say Dian had,

617
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,213
thy temples should be planted
presently with horns,

618
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,134
as was Actaeon's.

619
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,680
And the hounds should drive upon
thy new-transformed limbs,

620
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,304
unmannerly intruder
as thou art!

621
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,636
Under your patience,
gentle empress.

622
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,222
'Tis thought you have
a goodly gift in homing...

623
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,227
and to be doubted
that your Moor and you...

624
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,731
are singled forth
to try experiments.

625
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,905
Jove shield your husband
from his hounds today.

626
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,153
'Tis pity they should
take him for a stag.

627
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,236
Why are you
sequestered from all your train,

628
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,242
dismounted from your
snow-white, goodly steed,

629
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,744
and wandered hither
to an obscure plot...

630
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,577
accompanied but
with a barbarous Moor...

631
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,254
if foul desire
had not conducted you?

632
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,457
And, being
intercepted in your sport,

633
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,010
great reason that my noble lord
be rated for sauciness.

634
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,589
I pray you, let us hence,

635
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,972
and let her 'joy
her raven-colored love.

636
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:26,100
This valley fits the purpose
passing well.

637
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,478
The king my brother
shall have notice of this.

638
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,060
Good king, to be
so mightily abused.

639
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,612
Why have I patience
to endure all this?

640
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,945
Yah!

641
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,908
How now, dear sovereign
and our gracious mother!

642
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,585
Why doth your
highness look so pale and wan?

643
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,880
Have I not reason,
think you, to look pale?

644
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,380
These two have 'ticed me
hither to this place-

645
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:59,384
a barren, detested vale,
you see it is.

646
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,306
And when they showed me
this abhorred pit,

647
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:06,307
they told me here,
at dead time of the night,

648
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:11,483
a thousand fiends,
a thousand hissing snakes,

649
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,402
10,000 swelling toads-

650
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,115
would make such fearful
and confused cries...

651
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,192
as any mortal body hearing it...

652
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:25,156
should straight fall mad
or else die suddenly.

653
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,126
No sooner had they told
this hellish tale-

654
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:33,581
Then straight they told me
they would bind me here...

655
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,338
and leave me
to this miserable death.

656
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,918
And then...

657
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,556
they called me foul adulteress,

658
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,884
lascivious Goth,

659
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:48,847
and all the bitterest terms that
ever ear did hear to such effect.

660
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:54,277
And had you not
by wondrous fortune come,

661
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,106
this vengeance on me
had they executed.

662
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:08,699
Revenge it, as you love
your mother's life,

663
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,831
or be ye not henceforth
called my children!

664
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,289
This is a witness
that I am thy son.

665
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,127
And this for me,
struck home to show my strength.

666
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,439
Ay.

667
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,859
Come, Semiramis!

668
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,561
Nay, barbarous Tamora,

669
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,897
for no name fits thy nature
but thy own!

670
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,450
Give me the poniard. Your mother's
hand shall right your mother's wrong.

671
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,323
Stay, madam.

672
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,910
Here is more belongs to her.

673
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:54,496
First thrash the corn,
then after burn the straw.

674
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:58,299
This minion stood upon
her chastity,

675
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:02,753
upon her nuptial vow,
her loyalty,

676
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,591
and with that painted hope
she braves your mightiness.

677
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,096
And shall she carry this
unto her grave?

678
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,053
And if she do,

679
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,888
I would I were a eunuch.

680
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,267
Drag hence her husband
to some secret hole...

681
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,776
and make his dead trunk
pillow to our lust.

682
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,155
But when ye have
the honey ye desire,

683
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,203
let not this wasp
outlive us all to sting.

684
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,157
I warrant you, madam,
we will make that sure.

685
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,285
Come, mistress.

686
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,416
Now perforce we will enjoy...

687
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,793
that nice preserved
honesty of yours.

688
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,716
O Tamora, thou bearest
a woman's face-

689
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,296
I will not hear her speak.
Away with her.

690
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:49,134
Sweet lords, entreat her
hear me but a word.

691
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,969
Oh, listen, fair madam.

692
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:55,477
Let it be your glory
to see her tears,

693
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,023
but be your heart to them...

694
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,648
as unrelenting flint
to drops of rain.

695
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,275
When did the tiger's young ones
teach the dam?

696
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,402
Ahh.

697
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,609
Do not learn her wrath.

698
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,662
She taught it thee?

699
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:13,741
The milk thou suckst from
her did turn to marble.

700
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,997
Yet every mother
breeds not sons alike.

701
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,876
Do thou entreat her
show a woman's pity.

702
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:25,882
What, wouldst thou have me
prove myself a bastard?

703
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:31,012
Oh, be to me, though
thy hard heart say no,

704
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,561
nothing so kind,
but something pitiful!

705
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,391
I know not what it means.
Away with her.

706
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,191
Let me teach thee!

707
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,520
For my father's sake
that gave thee life...

708
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,946
when well he might
have slain thee!

709
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,696
Hadst thou in person
never offended me,

710
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,573
even for his sake
am I pitiless.

711
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,371
Remember, boys,
I poured forth tears in vain...

712
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,916
to save your brother
from the sacrifice,

713
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,665
but fierce Andronicus
would not relent.

714
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:01,418
Therefore away with her.
Use her as you will.

715
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:04,340
The worse to her,
the better loved of me.

716
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,720
Tamora, be called
a gentle queen,

717
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,098
and with thine own hands
kill me in this place!

718
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,896
And tumble me into
some loathsome pit...

719
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,521
where never man's eye
may behold my body.

720
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,446
Do this, and be
a charitable murderer.

721
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,615
So should I rob
my sweet sons of their fee?

722
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,942
No.

723
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,904
Let them satisfy
their lust on thee.

724
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:36,081
Away! For thou hast
stayed us here too long.

725
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:40,081
No grace? No womanhood?

726
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,039
Beastly creature!

727
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,089
Confusion fall!

728
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,759
Nay!
I'll stop your mouth!

729
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,838
Farewell, my sons.
See that you make her sure.

730
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,259
Ne'er let my heart know
merry cheer indeed...

731
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,266
till all the Andronici
be made away.

732
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,484
Now will I hence
to seek my lovely Moor...

733
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,860
and let my spleenful sons
this trull deflower.

734
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,963
Come on, my lords,
the better foot before.

735
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,923
Straight will I bring you to
the loathsome pit...

736
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,225
where I espied the tiger
fast asleep.

737
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,723
My sight is very dull,
whate'er it bodes.

738
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,555
And mine, I promise you.

739
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,015
Were it not for shame,

740
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,726
well could I leave our sport
to sleep a while.

741
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,252
What, art thou fallen?

742
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,469
What subtle hole is this...

743
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:20,598
whose mouth is covered
with rude-growing briers,

744
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:25,645
upon whose leaves are drops
of new-shed blood?

745
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,023
Speak, brother.
Hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

746
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,855
O brother, with
the dismall'st object hurt...

747
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,566
that ever eye with sight
made heart lament.

748
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,242
Why dost not comfort me...

749
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:39,197
and help me out of this unhallowed
and bloodstained hole?

750
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:42,032
My heart suspects more
than mine eye can see.

751
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,743
To prove thou hast
a true-divining heart,

752
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,794
Aaron and thou look
down into this den...

753
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,498
and see a fearful sight
of blood and death.

754
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,379
Aaron is gone!

755
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,801
Lord Bassianus lies
embrewed here,

756
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:53,877
all on a heap...

757
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,678
like to a slaughtered lamb.

758
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,257
O brother, help me!

759
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,553
I have not strength
to pluck thee to the brink!

760
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,186
Along with me.

761
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,022
I'll see what hole is here,

762
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,904
and what he is
that now is leapt into it.

763
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,994
Say!

764
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,118
Who art thou
that lately didst descend...

765
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:25,417
into this gaping hollow
of the earth, hmm?

766
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,460
The unhappy
sons of old Andronicus...

767
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,913
brought hither
in a most unlucky hour...

768
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,920
to find- to find thy
brother Bassianus dead!

769
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,922
My brother dead?

770
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,924
I know thou dost but jest.

771
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,597
He and his lady
both are at the lodge.

772
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,760
'Tis not an hour
since I left him there.

773
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,434
Where is my lord the king?

774
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,266
Here, Tamora,

775
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,693
though grieved
with killing grief.

776
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,112
And where is
thy brother Bassianus?

777
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,315
Now to the bottom dost
thou search my wound.

778
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,400
Poor Bassianus here
lies murdered.

779
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,953
Oh, then all too late
I bring this fatal writ.

780
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,281
"And if we miss
to meet him handsomely-

781
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,787
sweet huntsman Bassianus
'tis we mean-

782
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,415
do thou so much
as dig the grave for him.

783
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,337
Thou know'st our meaning.

784
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,456
Look for thy reward-"
"Look for thy reward...

785
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,542
among the nettles
at the elder tree...

786
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,627
which overshades the mouth
of that same pit...

787
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,463
where we decreed
to bury Bassianus.

788
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,969
Do this and purchase us
thy lasting friends."

789
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,142
O Tamora!
Was ever heard the like?

790
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,219
This is the pit
and this the elder tree.

791
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,305
Look, sirs, if you can
find the huntsman out...

792
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,981
that should have murdered
Bassianus here.

793
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,559
My gracious lord,

794
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,565
here is the bag of gold.

795
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,815
- Two of thy whelps-
- Huh?

796
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,741
Fell curs of bloody kind,

797
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,492
have here bereft
my brother of his life!

798
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,324
Sirs, drag them from
the pit unto the prison.

799
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,535
There let them bide
until we have devised...

800
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,496
some never-heard-of
torturing pain for them.

801
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,707
High emperor,

802
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,258
upon my feeble knee
I beg this boon...

803
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:00,008
with tears not lightly shed that
this fell fault of my accursed sons-

804
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,509
accursed, if the fault
be proved in them-

805
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:03,932
If it be proved?

806
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:07,181
You see it is apparent!

807
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,809
Who found this letter?
Tamora, was it you?

808
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,432
Andronicus himself did take it up.
Huh?

809
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,276
I did, my lord.

810
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,856
Yet let me be their bail,
for by my father's reverend tomb I vow...

811
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,236
they shall be ready
at your highness' will...

812
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:24,035
to answer their suspicion
with their lives.

813
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,613
Thou shalt not bail them!

814
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,245
See thou follow me.

815
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,292
Some bring the murdered body,
some the murderers.

816
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:39,172
Let them not speak a word!
The guilt is plain!

817
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,805
For by my soul,

818
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,383
were there worse end
than death,

819
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,310
that end upon them
should be executed.

820
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:00,021
Andronicus,
I will entreat the king.

821
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,824
Fear not thy sons. They
shall do well enough.

822
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,822
Come, Lucius, come.
Stay not to talk with them.

823
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,897
So now go tell-
an if thy tongue can speak-

824
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:38,102
who 'twas that cut thy tongue
and ravished thee.

825
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,107
Write down thy mind,

826
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,029
bewray thy meaning so,

827
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,199
and if thy stumps
will let thee,

828
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,776
play the scribe.

829
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,829
See how with signs and tokens
she can scrowl.

830
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,874
Go home!
Call for sweet water.

831
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,793
Sweet water!
Hither, sweet water!

832
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,997
Wash thy hands!

833
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,008
She hath no tongue to call,
nor hands to wash!

834
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,713
And so- And so let's leave her
to her silent walks.

835
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:09,345
And 'twere it my case,
I should go hang myself...

836
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:13,179
if thou hadst hands
to help thee knit the cord.

837
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,053
Who is this?

838
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,514
My niece?

839
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,017
If I do dream,

840
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,433
would all my wealth
would wake me.

841
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:59,691
If I do wake,

842
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,860
some planet strike me down...

843
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:05,109
that I may slumber
in eternal sleep.

844
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:07,782
Speak,

845
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,360
gentle niece.

846
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,071
What stern, ungentle hands...

847
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:19,537
have lopped and hewed and made thy
body bare of her two branches?

848
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,292
Those...

849
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,874
sweet ornaments...

850
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:28,428
whose circling shadows
kings have sought to sleep in.

851
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,802
Why dost not speak to me?

852
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,133
Come.

853
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,926
Let us go...

854
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,508
and make thy father blind,

855
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,344
for such a sight
will blind a father's eye.

856
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:22,099
An hour's storm
will drown the fragrant meads.

857
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:25,731
What will whole months of tears
thy father's eyes?

858
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,604
Do not draw back,

859
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,816
for we will mourn with thee.

860
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:34,152
Oh, could our mourning
ease thy misery.

861
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,341
Hear me, grave fathers.

862
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,418
Noble tribunes, stay.

863
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:56,553
For pity of mine age, whose youth
was spent in dangerous wars...

864
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,807
whilst you securely slept,

865
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:04,312
for all my blood
in Rome's great quarrel shed,

866
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,564
for all the frosty nights
that I have watched,

867
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:12,737
and for these bitter tears
which now you see...

868
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:17,237
filling the aged wrinkles
in my cheeks!

869
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,574
Be pitiful to
my condemned sons...

870
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:25,920
whose souls are not corrupted
as 'tis thought.

871
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,748
Oh!

872
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,635
Oh!

873
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,939
For two and 20 sons
I never wept...

874
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:53,319
because they died
in honor's lofty bed!

875
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:58,987
For these- these, tribunes,
in the dust I write...

876
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:02,825
my heart's deep languor
and my soul's sad tears!

877
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,537
Let my tears staunch
the earth's dry appetite!

878
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:10,374
My sons' sweet blood
will make it shame and blush!

879
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,925
Aaah!

880
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,944
O earth,

881
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,742
I shall befriend thee
more with rain...

882
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,742
that shall distill
from these two ancient urns...

883
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:27,200
than youthful April shall
with all his showers.

884
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,834
In summer's drought
I'll drop upon thee still.

885
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,926
In winter, with warm tears,

886
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:41,097
I'll melt the snow and keep
eternal springtime on thy face,

887
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:46,390
so thou refuse to drink
my dear sons' blood.

888
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,315
O reverend tribunes!

889
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,492
O gentle, aged men!

890
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,740
Unbind my sons!

891
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,573
Reverse the doom of death!

892
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,535
And let me say,
that never wept before,

893
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,291
my tears are now
prevailing orators!

894
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,498
O noble father,
you lament in vain.

895
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,833
The tribunes hear you not.
No man is by.

896
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,918
And you recount
your sorrows to a stone!

897
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,052
Lucius!

898
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:27,135
For thy brothers let me plead!

899
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:31,519
Grave tribunes,
once more I entreat of you.

900
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,897
My gracious lord,
no tribune hears you speak.

901
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,402
Why, 'tis no matter, man.

902
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,528
If they did hear,
they would not mark me,

903
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:45,328
or if they did mark,
they would not pity me.

904
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:51,326
Therefore I tell my sorrows
to the stones.

905
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:56,165
A stone is soft as wax,
tribunes more hard than stones.

906
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:59,717
A stone is silent
and offendeth not,

907
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,794
and tribunes
with their tongues...

908
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,506
doom men to death.

909
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,312
But wherefore stand'st thou
with thy weapon drawn?

910
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,857
To rescue my two brothers
from their death.

911
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,479
For which attempt,

912
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,653
the judges have pronounced my
everlasting doom of banishment.

913
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:26,612
Oh, happy man!
They have befriended thee.

914
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:29,288
Why, foolish Lucius,
dost thou not perceive...

915
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:32,663
that Rome is but
a wilderness of tigers?

916
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,249
Tigers must prey,

917
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:38,707
and Rome affords no prey
but me and mine.

918
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,923
How happy art thou, then,

919
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:46,051
from these devourers
to be banished.

920
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:52,433
But who comes with
our brother Marcus here?

921
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:57,149
Titus, prepare
thy aged eyes to weep,

922
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,774
or if not so,
thy noble heart to break.

923
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,481
I bring consuming
sorrow to thine age.

924
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,110
Will it consume me?

925
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:08,945
Let me see it then.

926
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:14,868
This... was thy daughter.

927
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,049
Why, Marcus, so she is.

928
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,593
This object kills me.

929
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,588
Fainthearted boy,

930
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:31,051
arise and look upon her!

931
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,145
Speak, Lavinia.

932
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,564
What accursed hand
hath made thee handless...

933
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:38,641
in thy father's sight?

934
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,977
What fool hath added
water to the sea...

935
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,859
or brought a torch
to bright-burning Troy?

936
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,408
My grief was at the height
before thou camest,

937
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:51,954
and now like Nilus,
it disdaineth bounds.

938
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,282
Give me a sword.
I'll chop off my hands, too,

939
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:57,244
for they have fought for Rome,
and all in vain.

940
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,374
In bootless prayer
have they been held up,

941
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:02,673
and they have served
me to effectless use!

942
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,046
Now all the service
I require of them...

943
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:07,174
is that the one
will help to cut the other.

944
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:17,639
Speak, gentle sister.
Who hath martyred thee?

945
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,351
Oh, that delightful engine
of her thoughts...

946
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,607
is torn from forth
that pretty, hollow cage.

947
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,188
Oh!

948
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:30,026
Say thou for her.
Who hath done this deed?

949
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:32,157
Oh, thus I found her
straying in the park,

950
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,863
seeking to hide herself
as doth the deer...

951
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,699
that hath received
some unrecuring wound.

952
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,376
It was my deer,

953
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:42,956
and he that wounded her hath hurt
me more than had he killed me dead.

954
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,379
For now I stand
as one upon a rock,

955
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:49,929
environed with
a wilderness of sea.

956
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:56,845
This way to death
my wretched sons have gone.

957
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:59,931
Here stands my other son,
a banished man,

958
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,810
and here my brother
weeping at my woes.

959
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:11,739
But that which gives my soul
the greatest spurn...

960
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,411
is dear Lavinia,

961
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,787
dearer than my soul.

962
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,752
Gentle daughter,

963
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,080
let me kiss thy lips...

964
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,844
or make some sign
how I may do thee ease.

965
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,017
Shall thy good uncle
and thy brother Lucius...

966
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,270
and thou and I...

967
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,727
sit round about some fountain
looking all downwards...

968
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,609
to behold our cheeks...

969
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,611
how they are stained,
like meadows, by a flood?

970
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,864
Or shall we cut away
our hands, like thine?

971
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,446
Or shall we bite our tongues...

972
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,157
and in dumb shows
pass the remainder...

973
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,993
of our hateful days?

974
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,078
What shall we do?

975
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,090
Let us that have our tongues...

976
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,759
plot some device
of further misery...

977
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:13,634
to make us wondered at
in time to come.

978
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,763
Titus Andronicus,

979
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,848
my lord the emperor
sends thee this word-

980
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,854
that if thou love thy sons,

981
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,061
let Marcus, Lucius,
or thyself, old Titus,

982
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,737
or any one of you
chop off your hand...

983
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,735
and send it to the king.

984
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:17,034
He for the same will send thee
hither both thy sons alive,

985
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,612
and that shall be the ransom
for their fault.

986
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,368
O gracious emperor!
O gentle Aaron!

987
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,290
Did ever raven sing
so like a lark?

988
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,835
With all my heart, I'll
send his majesty my hand.

989
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,664
Good Aaron, wilt thou
help to chop it off?

990
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:33,213
Stay, Father!

991
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,795
For that noble hand of thine that
hath thrown down so many enemies...

992
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,551
shall not be sent.

993
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,224
My hand will serve the turn. My youth
can better spare my blood than you.

994
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,176
Which of your hands
hath not defended Rome...

995
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,727
and reared aloft
the bloody battle-ax?

996
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,940
My hand hath been but idle. Let it serve
to ransom my two nephews from their death.

997
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,401
Nay, come, agree to whose
hand shall go along,

998
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,445
for fear they die
before their pardon come.

999
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,564
My hand shall go!
By heaven, it shall not go!

1000
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,446
Now let me show
a brother's love to thee.

1001
01:18:57,524 --> 01:19:00,277
Agree between you.
I will spare my hand.

1002
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,409
Then I'll go fetch an ax.

1003
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,490
But I will use the ax.

1004
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:11,877
Come hither, Aaron.
I'll deceive them both.

1005
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:15,301
Lend me thy hand,
and I will give thee mine.

1006
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,844
If that be called deceit,
I will be honest.

1007
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,511
Hey! Hey!

1008
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,096
Hey!

1009
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:57,960
Oh, now stay your strife!

1010
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,341
What shall be is dispatched.

1011
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:03,391
Good Aaron,
give his majesty my hand.

1012
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:06,344
Tell him it was a hand that
warded him from thousand dangers.

1013
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,225
Bid him bury it!

1014
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,648
As for my sons,
say I account of them...

1015
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:13,067
as jewels purchased
at an easy price.

1016
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,232
I go, Andronicus.

1017
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,280
And for thy hand,
look by and by...

1018
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:20,824
to have thy sons with thee.

1019
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,537
Their heads, I mean.

1020
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:30,243
Oh, how this villainy doth
fat me with the very thoughts of it!

1021
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,921
Let fools do good
and fair men call for grace.

1022
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,546
Aaron will have
his soul black...

1023
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:39,626
like his face.

1024
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:56,106
Oh, here I lift this one hand
up to heaven...

1025
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,780
and bow this feeble ruin
to the earth.

1026
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:04,027
If any power pities
wretched tears,

1027
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,282
to that I call.

1028
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,578
What, wouldst thou
kneel with me?

1029
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:13,786
Do, then, dear heart,

1030
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,372
for heaven shall hear
our prayers,

1031
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,299
or with our sighs
we'll breathe the welkin dim...

1032
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:22,720
and stain the sun with fog,
as sometimes clouds...

1033
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:25,264
when they do hug him
in their melting bosoms.

1034
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,467
O brother,
speak with possibility,

1035
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,768
and do not break into
these deep extremes.

1036
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,816
Are not my sorrows deep,
having no bottom?

1037
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,604
Then be my passions
bottomless with them.

1038
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:44,408
But yet let reason
govern thy lament.

1039
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:46,577
If there were reason
for these miseries,

1040
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:51,032
then into limits
could I bind my woes!

1041
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,625
When heaven doth weep,

1042
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,831
doth not the earth o'erflow?

1043
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,089
If the winds rage,

1044
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,468
doth not the sea wax mad,

1045
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:09,767
threatening the welkin
with his big, swollen face?

1046
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,891
Wouldst thou have a reason
for this coil?

1047
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,024
I am the sea.

1048
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,816
Hark how her sighs do blow.

1049
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:30,029
She is the weeping welkin,
I the earth.

1050
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,618
Then must my sea
be moved with her sighs.

1051
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:39,001
Then must my earth
with her continual tears...

1052
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,878
become a deluge,
overflowed and drowned.

1053
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,757
For why my bowels
cannot hide her woes,

1054
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:49,010
but like a drunkard
must I vomit them.

1055
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,014
Then give me leave.

1056
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:56,518
For losers will have leave
to ease their stomachs...

1057
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,725
with their bitter tongues.

1058
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,721
Worthy Andronicus,

1059
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:18,645
ill art thou repaid
for that good hand...

1060
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,563
thou sent'st the emperor.

1061
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,313
Here are the heads
of thy two noble sons,

1062
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,771
and here's thy hand,
in scorn to thee sent back.

1063
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,855
And be my heart
an ever-burning hell.

1064
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,325
These miseries are more than may be borne.

1065
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,573
That this sight should
make so deep a wound,

1066
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,826
and yet detested life
not shrink thereat!

1067
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,621
Alas, poor heart,

1068
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:45,252
that kiss is comfortless as
frozen water to a starved snake.

1069
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,925
When will this fearful
slumber have an end?

1070
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,629
Die, Andronicus!

1071
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:54,556
Thou dost not slumber.

1072
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:58,852
See thy two sons' heads,

1073
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,601
thy warlike hand,

1074
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:05,230
thy mangled daughter here,

1075
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:08,688
thy other banished son
with this dear sight...

1076
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,943
struck pale and bloodless,

1077
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:15,995
and thy brother, I, even like
a stony image cold and numb.

1078
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:19,118
Ah, now, no more
will I control thy griefs.

1079
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,199
Rent off thy silver hair!

1080
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,536
Thy other hand gnawing
with thy teeth!

1081
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,042
And be this dismal sight
the closing up...

1082
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,840
of our most wretched eyes.

1083
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:33,170
Now is a time to storm!
Why art thou still?

1084
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,015
Why dost thou laugh?

1085
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:46,434
Why, I have not
another tear to shed.

1086
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:54,984
Besides, this sorrow
is the enemy...

1087
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:57,866
and would usurp
upon my watery eyes...

1088
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:01,414
and make them blind
with tributary tears.

1089
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:05,870
Then which way shall
I find revenge's cave?

1090
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:10,465
For these two heads
do seem to speak to me...

1091
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,919
and threat me I shall
never come to bliss...

1092
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,882
till all these mischiefs
be returned again...

1093
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:21,059
even in their throats
that have committed them.

1094
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,776
Now, let me see
what task I have to do.

1095
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:32,692
You heavy people,
circle me about...

1096
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:35,866
that I may turn me
to each one of you...

1097
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,911
and swear unto my soul
to right your wrongs.

1098
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,464
The vow is made.

1099
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,225
Come, brother, take a head.

1100
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,347
In this hand,
the other will I bear.

1101
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,896
And thou, Lavinia,
thou shalt be employed.

1102
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,724
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench,
between thy teeth.

1103
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,233
As for thee, boy,
go get thee from my sight.

1104
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:17,987
Thou art an exile,
and thou must not stay.

1105
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,535
Hie to the Goths
and raise an army there.

1106
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:22,658
And if you love me,
as I think you do,

1107
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,832
let's kiss and part,

1108
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,125
for we have much to do.

1109
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:35,001
Farewell, Andronicus,
my noble father.

1110
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:39,300
The woefullest man
that ever lived in Rome.

1111
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,397
Now will I to the Goths...

1112
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:53,103
and raise a power
to be revenged on Rome...

1113
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:56,276
and Saturnine.

1114
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:40,000
So, so, now sit,

1115
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:42,211
and look you eat
no more than will preserve...

1116
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,171
just so much strength in us...

1117
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:47,929
as will revenge
these bitter woes of ours.

1118
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:17,500
Thou map of woe
that thus dost talk in signs,

1119
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,584
when thy poor heart beats
with outrageous beating,

1120
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:25,170
thou canst not strike it thus
to make it still.

1121
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:29,975
Wound it with sighing, girl.
Kill it with groans.

1122
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,850
Or get some little knife
between thy teeth...

1123
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:36,773
and, just against thy heart,
make thou a hole,

1124
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:39,192
that all the tears
that thy poor eyes let fall...

1125
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,940
may run into that sink...

1126
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:45,024
and, soaking in, drown the
lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.

1127
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,653
Fie, brother, fie!

1128
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:47,985
Hmm?

1129
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:51,868
Teach her not thus to lay such
violent hands upon her tender life.

1130
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,289
How now! Has sorrow
made thee dote already?

1131
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:59,338
Oh, handle not the theme,
to talk of hands,

1132
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:02,461
lest we remember still
that we have none.

1133
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:06,507
Come, let's fall to.

1134
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:13,055
And, gentle girl, eat this.

1135
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,398
Here is no drink.

1136
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,708
Hark, Marcus, what she says.

1137
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:47,044
I can interpret
all her martyred signs.

1138
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:52,094
She says she drinks
no other drink but tears.

1139
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:58,522
Speechless complainer,
I will learn thy thought.

1140
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:03,185
Thou shalt not sigh
nor hold thy stumps to heaven...

1141
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:05,691
nor wink, nor nod,
nor kneel, nor make a sign,

1142
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,693
but I of these
will wrest an alphabet...

1143
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:11,322
and by still practice
learn to know thy meaning.

1144
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,379
What dost thou strike at,
Lucius, with thy knife?

1145
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:25,207
At that that I have
killed, my lord, a fly.

1146
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,418
Out on thee, murderer!
Kill'st my heart!

1147
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,299
A deed of death done on the innocent
becomes not Titus' grandson.

1148
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,472
Get thee gone. I see thou
art not for my company.

1149
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:35,266
Alas, my lord,
I have but killed a fly.

1150
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,718
But?

1151
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:39,054
How, if that fly had
a father and mother?

1152
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,231
How would they hang
their slender, gilded wings...

1153
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:43,809
and buzz lamenting
doings in the air.

1154
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:48,068
Poor, harmless fly,

1155
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,740
that with his pretty, buzzing melody
came here to make us merry.

1156
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:53,034
And thou hast killed him.

1157
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:54,494
Pardon me, sir.
Hmm?

1158
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,493
It was a black,
ill-favored fly,

1159
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:59,324
like to the empress' Moor.

1160
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:02,331
Therefore I killed him.

1161
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,912
Oh.

1162
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,248
Oh.

1163
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:08,083
Oh!

1164
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,670
Pardon me
for reprehending thee,

1165
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:13,471
for thou hast done
a charitable deed.

1166
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:15,423
Give me thy knife.
I will insult on him,

1167
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,601
flattering myself
as if it were the Moor...

1168
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,427
come hither purposely
to poison me.

1169
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,936
There's for thyself,
and that's for Tamora!

1170
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:31,315
Ah, sirrah!

1171
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:34,526
As yet, I think,
we are not brought so low...

1172
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:37,988
but that between us
we can kill a fly...

1173
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:41,416
that comes in likeness
of a coal-black Moor.

1174
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:51,506
Hey, baby, want to go for a ride?

1175
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,268
Yeah!

1176
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,967
Help, grandsire! Help!

1177
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,513
My Aunt Lavinia
follows me everywhere.

1178
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,060
I know not why.

1179
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:26,474
Good Uncle Marcus, see
how swift she comes.

1180
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:30,309
Alas, sweet aunt,
I know not what you mean.

1181
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,940
Stand by me, Lucius.
Do not fear thine aunt.

1182
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:35,067
Now, Lavinia, what means this?

1183
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,903
Soft! So swiftly
she turns the leaves.

1184
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:39,484
Help her.

1185
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,780
What would she find?

1186
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:46,457
Lavinia, shall I read?

1187
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:51,337
"This is the tragic tale
of Philomel...

1188
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,631
and treats of Tereus'
treason and his rape."

1189
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,585
See, Brother, see.

1190
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:59,217
Note how she quotes the leaves.

1191
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:02,766
Lavinia, wert thou
thus surprised, sweet girl,

1192
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,138
ravished and wronged
as Philomela was?

1193
01:36:05,218 --> 01:36:08,062
Forced in the ruthless,
vast, and gloomy wood?

1194
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,644
Ay, such a place there is
where we did hunt.

1195
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:16,149
Oh, why should nature
build so foul a den...

1196
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:19,199
unless the gods delight
in tragedies?

1197
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:23,161
Give sign, sweet girl,

1198
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:26,615
what Roman lord it was
durst do this deed.

1199
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:36,174
My lord, look here.
Look here, Lavinia!

1200
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:38,798
This sandy plot is plain.

1201
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,880
Guide, if thou canst,
this after me...

1202
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:45,638
when I have writ my name
without the help of any hand at all.

1203
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:55,397
Write thou, good niece,
and here display at last...

1204
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:58,229
what God will have discovered
for revenge.

1205
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:01,817
Cursed be the heart
that forced us to this shift.

1206
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:50,206
it's Chiron and Demetrius.

1207
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:57,080
My lord, kneel down with me.

1208
01:37:57,163 --> 01:38:00,417
Kneel, Lavinia,
and kneel, sweet boy,

1209
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:04,221
and swear with me
that we will prosecute,

1210
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,423
by good advice,
mortal revenge...

1211
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,725
upon these traitorous Goths...

1212
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,805
and see their blood
or die with this reproach.

1213
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,981
'Tis sure enough,
an you knew how.

1214
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,813
But if you hunt
these bear-whelps,

1215
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:19,394
then beware.

1216
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:25,491
You're a young huntsman,
Marcus. Let alone.

1217
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:29,571
Come, go with me into mine armory, Lucius.
I'll fit thee.

1218
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:32,407
And withal my boy shall send
from me to the empress' sons...

1219
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,743
presents that I intend
to send them both.

1220
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:36,794
Come, thou'lt do my message,
wilt thou not?

1221
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:39,122
Ay, with my dagger
in their bosoms, grandsire.

1222
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:41,583
No, not so.
I'll teach thee another course.

1223
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:43,168
Lavinia, come.

1224
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:47,138
Marcus, look to my house.

1225
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:55,430
O heavens, can you hear
a good man groan...

1226
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,062
and not relent
or not compassion him?

1227
01:39:00,226 --> 01:39:04,026
Marcus, attend him
in his ecstasy...

1228
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,608
that hath more scars
of sorrow in his heart...

1229
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:09,035
than foemen's marks
upon his battered shield,

1230
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:13,411
but yet so just
that he will not revenge.

1231
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,541
Revenge, ye heavens,
for old Andronicus!

1232
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,370
Demetrius!
Here's the son of Lucius!

1233
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:55,073
He hath some message
to deliver us.

1234
01:39:56,324 --> 01:40:00,830
Ay, some mad message
from his mad grandfather.

1235
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:02,914
Aaah!

1236
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,176
- My lords-
- Whoo!

1237
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:08,878
With all the humbleness I may,

1238
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:11,089
I greet your honors
from Andronicus.

1239
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:14,722
Gramercy, lovely Lucius.
What's the news?

1240
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:19,314
My grandsire, well advised,
hath sent by me...

1241
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,607
the goodliest weapons
of his armory...

1242
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,901
to gratify your honorable youth-

1243
01:40:23,976 --> 01:40:26,570
the hope of Rome,
for so he bid me say,

1244
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:28,364
and so I do.

1245
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:30,737
And so I leave you both.

1246
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:33,486
Like bloody villains.

1247
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,822
Yaaah!

1248
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:53,430
Oh, 'tis a verse in Horace.

1249
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,258
I know it well.

1250
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:57,218
"He who is pure of life
and free of sin...

1251
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,804
needs no bow and arrow
of the Moor."

1252
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:02,231
Ay, just.
A verse in Horace.

1253
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:03,979
Right, you have it.

1254
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:08,564
Now, what a thing
it is to be an ass.

1255
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:10,398
Here's no sound jest.

1256
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,154
The old man
hath found their guilt...

1257
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,486
and sends them weapons
wrapped about with lines...

1258
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:18,540
that wound beyond their feeling,
to the quick.

1259
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:21,037
But were our witty empress
well afoot,

1260
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:24,371
she would applaud
Andronicus' conceit,

1261
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:25,955
but...

1262
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:30,422
let her rest
in her unrest a while.

1263
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:35,506
Come, let's go,

1264
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,433
and pray to all the gods
to aid our mother...

1265
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,431
in her labor pains.

1266
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,973
Pray to the devils.

1267
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:45,183
The gods have given us over.

1268
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:49,487
Why do the emperor's trumpets
flourish thus?

1269
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:52,190
Oh, belike for joy
the emperor hath a son.

1270
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,988
Soft! Who comes here?

1271
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:01,999
Good morrow, lords.
Oh, tell me,

1272
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:04,293
did you see Aaron the Moor?

1273
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:08,165
Well, more or less, or
ne'er a wit at all. Oh!

1274
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:11,126
Here Aaron is,
and what with Aaron now?

1275
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:12,881
O gentle Aaron,

1276
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,837
we are all undone!

1277
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,094
Now, help, or woe
betide thee evermore.

1278
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:19,801
What a caterwauling
dost thou keep.

1279
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:22,478
What dost thou wrap
and fumble in thine arms?

1280
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:26,057
Oh, that which I would hide
from heaven's eye-

1281
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:29,644
our empress' shame
and stately Rome's disgrace.

1282
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:33,448
She is delivered, lords,
she is delivered.

1283
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:35,032
To whom?

1284
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:37,826
I mean, she is brought abed.

1285
01:42:37,902 --> 01:42:40,371
Well, God give her good rest.

1286
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:43,495
- What hath he sent her?
- A devil.

1287
01:42:45,785 --> 01:42:48,584
Why, then,
she is the devil's dam,

1288
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,165
a joyful issue.

1289
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:53,877
A joyless, dismal, black,
and sorrowful issue.

1290
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:57,179
Here is the babe,
as loathsome as a toad...

1291
01:42:57,254 --> 01:42:59,677
amongst the fairest
breeders of our clime.

1292
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:03,557
The empress sends it thee,

1293
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:05,684
thy stamp, thy seal,

1294
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:08,107
and bids thee christen it
with thy dagger's point.

1295
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,184
'Zounds, ye whore!

1296
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:15,148
Is black so base a hue?

1297
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:18,952
Sweet blowse, you are
a beauteous blossom, sure.

1298
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:20,573
Villain,

1299
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:23,202
what hast thou done?

1300
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,533
That which thou canst not undo.

1301
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:27,243
Thou hast
undone our mother.

1302
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:30,250
Villain, I have done thy mother.

1303
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:33,629
And therein, hellish dog,
thou hast undone her!

1304
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:37,970
Accursed the offspring
of so foul a fiend.

1305
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:39,968
It shall not live.

1306
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:42,884
It shall not die!

1307
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:46,016
Aaron, it must.
The mother wills it so.

1308
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:48,143
What?

1309
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:50,145
Must it, nurse?

1310
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:55,234
Then let no man but I do
execution on my flesh and blood.

1311
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:57,406
I'll broach the tadpole
on this rapier's point.

1312
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,280
Nurse, give it me! My sword
shall soon dispatch it!

1313
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,071
Sooner this sword
shall plow thy bowels up!

1314
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:09,493
Stay, murderous villains!

1315
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:11,250
Will you kill your brother?

1316
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:14,582
Now, by the burning
tapers of the sky...

1317
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:17,214
that shone so brightly
when this boy was got,

1318
01:44:17,293 --> 01:44:19,136
he dies upon
my scimitar's sharp point...

1319
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:23,341
that touches this
my first-born son and heir.

1320
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,886
What?

1321
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:30,849
What, ye sanguine,
shallow-hearted boys?

1322
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:32,774
Ye white-limed walls.

1323
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:35,603
Ye alehouse painted signs.

1324
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:39,031
Coal-black is better
than another hue...

1325
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:42,280
in that it scorns
to bear another hue.

1326
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,032
For all the water
of the ocean...

1327
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:46,330
could never turn
a swan's black legs to white...

1328
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:49,409
although she lave them
hourly in the flood.

1329
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:01,629
Tell the empress from me...

1330
01:45:01,712 --> 01:45:04,340
that I am of age
to keep mine own.

1331
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,972
Excuse it how she can.

1332
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:09,850
Wilt thou betray
thy noble mistress thus?

1333
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:11,931
My mistress is my mistress.

1334
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:14,354
This...

1335
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:16,856
myself-

1336
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:20,861
the vigor and the picture
of my youth.

1337
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,739
This before all the world
do I prefer.

1338
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:26,571
This, 'spite all the world,
will I keep safe-

1339
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,156
Oh!

1340
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:30,583
Or some of you shall
smoke for it in Rome.

1341
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:32,877
By this our mother
is forever shamed.

1342
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:35,922
The emperor in his rage
will doom her death.

1343
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,919
I blush to think
upon this ignomy.

1344
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:41,343
Why, there's the privilege
your beauty bears.

1345
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:44,630
Fie, treacherous hue,
that will betray with blushing...

1346
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:47,637
the close enacts
and counsels of the heart.

1347
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:52,604
Here's a young lad
framed of another leer.

1348
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,438
Look!

1349
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:01,947
Look how the black slave
smiles upon the father,

1350
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,945
as who should say,

1351
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:07,779
"Old lad, I am thine own."

1352
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:09,705
Aaron,

1353
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,703
what shall I say
unto the empress?

1354
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,086
Advise thee, Aaron,
what is to be done,

1355
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,959
so that we may all
subscribe to thy advice.

1356
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:22,544
Save thou the child,
so we may all be safe.

1357
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,378
Then sit we down,

1358
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:27,761
and let us all consult.

1359
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,595
Ah! My son and I will
have the wind of you.

1360
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,304
Keep there!

1361
01:46:39,268 --> 01:46:42,613
Now, talk at pleasure
of your safety.

1362
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:44,315
How many women saw
this child of his?

1363
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,277
Ah, so, brave lords.

1364
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:51,034
When we join in league,
I am a lamb.

1365
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:54,579
But if you brave the Moor,

1366
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:57,457
the chafed boar,
the mountain lioness,

1367
01:46:57,536 --> 01:47:01,757
the ocean swells not so
as Aaron storms.

1368
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:09,841
But say again,
how many saw the child?

1369
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:13,978
Cornelia the midwife
and myself...

1370
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:17,057
and no one else
but the delivered empress.

1371
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:20,643
The empress,

1372
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:22,899
the midwife...

1373
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:25,899
and yourself.

1374
01:47:27,107 --> 01:47:29,781
Two may keep counsel
when the third's away.

1375
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:33,030
Go to the empress.
Mm-hmm.

1376
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,615
Tell her this I said.

1377
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,882
So cries a pig
prepared to the spit.

1378
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,298
What meanest thou, Aaron?
Wherefore didst thou this?

1379
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:49,722
Oh, lord, sir,

1380
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:51,299
'tis a deed of policy.

1381
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:54,682
What? Should she live
to betray this guilt of ours,

1382
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,559
a long-tongued
babbling gossip?

1383
01:47:57,638 --> 01:47:59,561
No, lords. No.

1384
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,142
Hark ye, lords.

1385
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:04,980
You see I have given her physic.
You must needs bestow her funeral.

1386
01:48:05,062 --> 01:48:07,781
The fields are near.
You are gallant grooms.

1387
01:48:07,856 --> 01:48:10,234
This done, make sure
you take no longer days,

1388
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,786
but send the midwife
presently to me.

1389
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:15,364
The midwife and the nurse
well made away,

1390
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:18,200
then let the ladies tattle
what they please.

1391
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:23,130
Aaron, I see thou wilt not
trust the air with secrets.

1392
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:26,250
For this care of Tamora,

1393
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:29,086
herself and hers
are highly bound to thee.

1394
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:35,848
Now to the Goths,
as swift as swallow flies,

1395
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:39,055
there to dispose
this treasure in mine arms...

1396
01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:41,937
and secretly to greet
the empress' friends.

1397
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:47,734
Come on,
you thick-lipped slave.

1398
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:49,690
I'll bear you hence,

1399
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:52,868
for it is you
who puts us to our shifts.

1400
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:57,081
I'll make you feed
on berries and on roots...

1401
01:48:57,156 --> 01:48:59,500
and cabin in a cave...

1402
01:48:59,575 --> 01:49:02,169
and bring you up
to be a warrior...

1403
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:04,872
and command a camp.

1404
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:27,979
Hep!

1405
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:50,467
Hep! Hep!

1406
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:24,679
Come, Marcus, come.

1407
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:27,264
Kinsmen, this is the way.

1408
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:30,851
Sir boy, now let me see
your archery.

1409
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,858
Look ye draw home enough,
and 'tis there straight.

1410
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:38,860
Goddess of justice
has left the earth.

1411
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:45,199
Be remembered, Marcus,

1412
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:48,456
she's gone, she's fled.

1413
01:51:50,495 --> 01:51:52,213
Sirs, take you to your tools.

1414
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:57,216
You, cousins, shall go sound
the ocean and cast your nets.

1415
01:51:57,294 --> 01:51:59,592
Happily you may catch her
in the sea.

1416
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:03,676
Yet there's
as little justice as at land.

1417
01:52:03,759 --> 01:52:06,558
No. Publius and Sempronius,
you must do it.

1418
01:52:06,637 --> 01:52:09,231
'Tis you must dig
with mattock and with spade...

1419
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:11,900
and pierce the inmost
center of the earth.

1420
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,444
Then, when you come
to Pluto's region,

1421
01:52:14,519 --> 01:52:16,521
I pray you,
give him this petition.

1422
01:52:16,605 --> 01:52:19,654
Tell him it is for
justice and for aid,

1423
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,986
and that it comes
from old Andronicus,

1424
01:52:22,069 --> 01:52:26,074
shaken with sorrows
in ungrateful Rome.

1425
01:52:27,783 --> 01:52:29,831
Ah, Rome.

1426
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:32,333
Well, well.

1427
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:35,291
I made thee miserable that time
I threw the people's suffrages...

1428
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:38,093
on him that thus
doth tyrannize o'er me.

1429
01:52:39,878 --> 01:52:42,597
Go, get you gone,
and pray be careful all...

1430
01:52:42,673 --> 01:52:44,926
and leave you not
a man of war unsearched.

1431
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:47,431
This wicked emperor may
have shipped her hence...

1432
01:52:47,511 --> 01:52:51,266
and, kinsmen, then we may
go pipe for justice.

1433
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:11,118
O Publius,

1434
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:14,831
is not this a heavy case, to see
thy noble uncle thus distract?

1435
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:16,915
Therefore, my lord,

1436
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:18,967
it highly us concerns
by day and night...

1437
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,464
to attend him carefully...

1438
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:23,297
and feed his humor
kindly as we may...

1439
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,553
till time beget
some careful remedy.

1440
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:29,637
Kinsmen, his sorrows
are past remedy.

1441
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:36,814
Publius, how now?

1442
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:38,987
How now, my masters?

1443
01:53:39,062 --> 01:53:41,281
You're a good archer, Marcus.
Come to this gear.

1444
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:44,326
Ad Jovem.
That's for you.

1445
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:47,913
Here. Ad Apollinem.

1446
01:53:49,197 --> 01:53:51,916
Here, boy, to Pallas.

1447
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:54,086
Here, to Mercury.

1448
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:58,006
To Saturn, Caius,
not to Saturnine.

1449
01:53:58,081 --> 01:53:59,833
You were as good to shoot
against the wind.

1450
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,544
To it, boy.

1451
01:54:02,627 --> 01:54:04,595
Eh-

1452
01:54:05,464 --> 01:54:07,307
Marcus, loose when I bid.

1453
01:54:07,382 --> 01:54:09,350
Of my word,
I've written to effect.

1454
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:11,645
There's not a god
left unsolicited.

1455
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,939
My lord, I aim
a mile beyond the moon.

1456
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:16,608
Your letter is with Jupiter
by this.

1457
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:22,864
Marcus, we are but shrubs,

1458
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,283
no cedars we,

1459
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:28,863
no big-boned men framed
of the cyclops' size.

1460
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:33,538
But metal, Marcus,
steel to the very back,

1461
01:54:34,326 --> 01:54:37,375
yet wrung with wrongs more
than our backs can bear.

1462
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:42,843
And sith there's no justice
in earth nor hell,

1463
01:54:42,918 --> 01:54:45,137
we will solicit heaven...

1464
01:54:45,212 --> 01:54:48,056
and move the gods
to send down justice...

1465
01:54:48,131 --> 01:54:50,133
for to wreak our wrongs.

1466
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:53,224
Come, masters, draw.

1467
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:55,305
Kinsmen,

1468
01:54:55,389 --> 01:54:57,062
shoot all your shafts
into the court.

1469
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,643
We will afflict
the emperor in his pride.

1470
01:55:22,499 --> 01:55:25,298
Good boy, in Virgo's lap.
Give it Pallas.

1471
01:55:36,721 --> 01:55:40,021
It's from Titus!
It's from Titus!

1472
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:25,650
My lords,
what wrongs are these?

1473
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:30,280
Was ever seen an emperor
in Rome thus overborne,

1474
01:56:30,358 --> 01:56:32,531
troubled, confronted thus,

1475
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:34,784
and for the extent
of equal justice...

1476
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:37,662
used in such contempt?

1477
01:56:38,533 --> 01:56:42,583
My lords, you know,
as do the mightful gods,

1478
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:45,836
however these disturbers
of our peace buzz...

1479
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:47,543
in the people's ears,

1480
01:56:47,626 --> 01:56:50,254
there naught has passed,
but even with law,

1481
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:53,511
against the willful sons
of old Andronicus!

1482
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:59,521
And what and if his sorrows
do overwhelm his wits?

1483
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:01,473
Hmm?

1484
01:57:01,556 --> 01:57:05,231
Shall we be thus afflicted
by his wreaks, his fits,

1485
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:07,233
his frenzies,
and his bitterness?

1486
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:10,566
And now he writes to heaven
for his redress.

1487
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:13,243
See? Here's to Jove,
this to Apollo,

1488
01:57:13,318 --> 01:57:16,697
this to Mercury,
this to the god of war-

1489
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:20,956
Sweet scrolls to fly about
the streets of Rome!

1490
01:57:22,827 --> 01:57:26,206
What's this but libeling
against the senate...

1491
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:29,042
and blazoning our injustice
everywhere?

1492
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:34,973
A goodly humor,
is it not, my lords?

1493
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:39,227
For who would say in Rome
no justice were?

1494
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:41,680
Lord of my life,
commander of my thoughts-

1495
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,686
But if I live,

1496
01:57:45,141 --> 01:57:48,520
his feigned ecstasies
shall be no shelter...

1497
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:50,856
to these outrages.

1498
01:57:52,983 --> 01:57:55,111
But he and his shall know...

1499
01:57:55,193 --> 01:57:58,493
that justice lives
in Saturninus' health,

1500
01:57:58,572 --> 01:58:01,872
whom, if she sleep,
he'll so awake...

1501
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:04,419
as she in fury shall cut off...

1502
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:07,088
the proud'st conspirator
that lives.

1503
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:09,712
Shh.

1504
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:11,418
Calm thee,

1505
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:13,754
and bear the faults
of Titus' age,

1506
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:17,967
the effects of sorrow
for his valiant sons,

1507
01:58:18,049 --> 01:58:20,427
whose loss
hath pierced him deep...

1508
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:22,604
and scarred his heart.

1509
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:26,354
O Titus, I have touched
thee to the quick.

1510
01:58:27,684 --> 01:58:29,277
Take arms, my lords.

1511
01:58:29,352 --> 01:58:31,480
Rome never had more cause.

1512
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:33,657
The Goths have gathered head.

1513
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:36,656
And with a power of high-resolved
men bent to the spoil,

1514
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:39,113
they hither march amain
under conduct of Lucius,

1515
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:41,664
son to old Andronicus.

1516
01:58:43,783 --> 01:58:46,787
Is warlike Lucius
leader of the Goths?

1517
01:58:57,797 --> 01:59:01,392
Ay, now begins our sorrows
to approach.

1518
01:59:02,761 --> 01:59:06,015
'Tis he the common
people love so much.

1519
01:59:06,097 --> 01:59:08,600
Myself have often
heard them say-

1520
01:59:08,683 --> 01:59:11,436
when I have walked
like a private man-

1521
01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:14,898
that Lucius' banishment
was wrongfully,

1522
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:16,574
and that they have wished...

1523
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:18,823
that Lucius were their emperor.

1524
01:59:23,406 --> 01:59:25,454
Why should you fear?

1525
01:59:25,533 --> 01:59:27,831
Is not your city strong?

1526
01:59:27,911 --> 01:59:30,755
Ay, but the citizens
favor Lucius...

1527
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:33,333
and will revolt from me
to succor him.

1528
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:38,468
King, be thy thoughts
imperious like thy name.

1529
01:59:41,091 --> 01:59:44,345
Is the sun dimmed,
that gnats do fly in it?

1530
01:59:48,515 --> 01:59:50,563
Then cheer thy spirit.

1531
01:59:50,642 --> 01:59:53,316
For know, thou emperor,

1532
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:57,320
I will enchant
the old Andronicus...

1533
01:59:57,399 --> 02:00:00,448
with words more sweet
and yet more dangerous...

1534
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:04,998
than bait to fish
or honey stalks to sheep.

1535
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:08,202
But he will not entreat
his son for us.

1536
02:00:08,284 --> 02:00:11,083
If Tamora entreat him,
then he will.

1537
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:20,714
Go thou before.
Be our ambassador.

1538
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:25,268
Say that the emperor requests
a parley of warlike Lucius...

1539
02:00:25,343 --> 02:00:28,847
and appoint the meeting even at his
father's house- the old Andronicus.

1540
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,558
Aemelius,
do this message honorably.

1541
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:33,985
And if he stand on hostage
for his safety,

1542
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,654
bid him demand...

1543
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:38,653
what pledge
shall please him best.

1544
02:00:38,732 --> 02:00:41,451
Your bidding
shall I do effectually.

1545
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:45,701
Now will I
to that old Andronicus...

1546
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:49,501
and temper him
with all the art I have.

1547
02:00:49,576 --> 02:00:52,375
Then go successantly...

1548
02:00:52,454 --> 02:00:54,331
and plead to him.

1549
02:02:11,491 --> 02:02:13,585
Approved warriors,

1550
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:15,913
and my faithful friends,

1551
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:19,374
I have received letters
from great Rome...

1552
02:02:19,457 --> 02:02:22,836
which signify what hate
they bear their emperor...

1553
02:02:22,919 --> 02:02:26,139
and how desirous
of our sight they are.

1554
02:02:26,214 --> 02:02:29,718
Therefore, great lords,

1555
02:02:29,801 --> 02:02:32,600
be as your titles witness-

1556
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:37,685
imperious and impatient
of your wrongs.

1557
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:42,364
And wherein Rome
hath done you any scathe,

1558
02:02:42,438 --> 02:02:46,944
let him make
treble satisfaction.

1559
02:02:47,026 --> 02:02:51,122
Brave slip, sprung from
the great Andronicus-

1560
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:55,703
whose name was once our terror,
now our comfort-

1561
02:02:55,785 --> 02:02:58,004
whose high exploits
and honorable deeds...

1562
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:01,299
ingrateful Rome requites
with foul contempt,

1563
02:03:04,627 --> 02:03:07,176
be bold in us.

1564
02:03:07,255 --> 02:03:09,553
We'll follow
where thou leadest...

1565
02:03:09,632 --> 02:03:12,431
and be avenged
on cursed Tamora.

1566
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:15,810
And as he saith,
so say we all with him!

1567
02:03:38,912 --> 02:03:40,960
O worthy Goths,

1568
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:47,261
this is the incarnate devil...

1569
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:50,466
that robbed Andronicus
of his good hand.

1570
02:03:51,841 --> 02:03:56,062
This is the pearl
that pleased your empress' eye.

1571
02:03:59,223 --> 02:04:02,193
And here's the base fruit
of his burning lust.

1572
02:04:08,024 --> 02:04:11,073
Say, walleyed slave,

1573
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:17,201
whither wouldst thou convey this
growing image of thy fiendlike face?

1574
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:23,206
Why dost not speak?

1575
02:04:24,666 --> 02:04:26,168
What?

1576
02:04:27,502 --> 02:04:29,004
Deaf?

1577
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:33,550
Not a word?

1578
02:04:35,218 --> 02:04:36,970
A halter, soldiers!

1579
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:39,727
Hang him on this tree.

1580
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:43,393
And by his side,

1581
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:45,820
his fruit of bastardy!

1582
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:48,239
Touch not the boy!

1583
02:04:50,608 --> 02:04:52,781
He is of royal blood.

1584
02:04:53,778 --> 02:04:55,951
Too like the sire
for ever being good.

1585
02:04:57,281 --> 02:04:59,909
First hang the child,

1586
02:04:59,993 --> 02:05:02,746
that he may see it sprawl-

1587
02:05:02,829 --> 02:05:05,548
a sight to vex
the father's soul withal.

1588
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:08,009
Get me a ladder!

1589
02:05:08,084 --> 02:05:12,339
Lucius... save the child.

1590
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:15,676
If thou do this, I'll show thee
wondrous things...

1591
02:05:15,758 --> 02:05:18,887
that highly may
advantage thee to hear.

1592
02:05:18,970 --> 02:05:22,520
If thou wilt not,
befall what may befall.

1593
02:05:22,598 --> 02:05:25,693
I'll speak no more,
but vengeance rot you all!

1594
02:05:25,768 --> 02:05:27,862
Say on,

1595
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:31,567
and if it please me which thou
speakst, thy child shall live,

1596
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:33,697
and I will see it nourished.

1597
02:05:33,776 --> 02:05:36,575
And if it please thee!

1598
02:05:36,654 --> 02:05:39,032
Why, assure thee, Lucius,
'twill vex thy soul...

1599
02:05:39,115 --> 02:05:41,288
to hear what I shall speak,

1600
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:44,962
for I must talk of murders,
rapes, and massacres,

1601
02:05:45,038 --> 02:05:47,757
acts of black night,
abominable deeds,

1602
02:05:47,832 --> 02:05:52,053
complots of mischief,
treason, villainies.

1603
02:05:52,128 --> 02:05:54,130
And this shall all
be buried in my death...

1604
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:56,215
unless thou swear to me
my child shall live.

1605
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:58,393
Tell on thy mind.
I say thy child shall live.

1606
02:05:58,509 --> 02:06:01,388
Swear that he shall. Then I will begin.
Who should I swear by?

1607
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:03,473
Thou believest no god.

1608
02:06:03,556 --> 02:06:05,854
What if I do not?

1609
02:06:05,933 --> 02:06:08,561
As indeed I do not.

1610
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:11,022
Yet- for I know
thou art religious...

1611
02:06:11,105 --> 02:06:15,155
and hast a thing within thee
called conscience-

1612
02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:17,487
therefore thou shalt vow
by that same god,

1613
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:20,619
what god soe'er it be,
to save my boy-

1614
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:25,040
to nourish and bring him up...

1615
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:28,589
or else I will discover
naught to thee.

1616
02:06:33,294 --> 02:06:36,093
Even by my god,
I swear to thee I will.

1617
02:06:53,189 --> 02:06:55,157
First know thou,

1618
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:57,944
I begot him on the empress.

1619
02:06:58,027 --> 02:07:01,657
Oh, most insatiate
and luxurious woman.

1620
02:07:06,244 --> 02:07:09,748
Tut, Lucius, this was
but a deed of charity...

1621
02:07:09,831 --> 02:07:12,801
to that which thou
shalt hear of me anon.

1622
02:07:12,875 --> 02:07:15,549
'Twas her two sons
that murdered Bassianus.

1623
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:17,551
They...

1624
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,634
cut thy sister's tongue
and ravished her,

1625
02:07:20,716 --> 02:07:24,937
and cut her hands
and trimmed her as thou sawest.

1626
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:37,654
Detestable villain!
Callest thou that trimming?

1627
02:07:37,733 --> 02:07:39,656
Why, she was washed...

1628
02:07:39,735 --> 02:07:42,204
and cut... and trimmed,

1629
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:45,454
and 'twas trim sport for them
that had the doing of it.

1630
02:07:45,533 --> 02:07:47,501
Oh, barbarous,
beastly villains,

1631
02:07:47,577 --> 02:07:49,420
like thyself!

1632
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:56,052
Indeed, I was their tutor
to instruct them.

1633
02:07:56,127 --> 02:08:00,223
Ah, that codding spirit
had they from their mother.

1634
02:08:00,298 --> 02:08:03,393
That bloody mind, I think,
they learned of me.

1635
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:05,894
Oh!

1636
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:09,816
Let my deeds be witness
of my worth.

1637
02:08:09,891 --> 02:08:12,110
I trained thy brethren
to that guileful hole...

1638
02:08:12,185 --> 02:08:15,314
where the dead corpse
of Bassianus lay.

1639
02:08:15,396 --> 02:08:17,364
I wrote the letter
that thy father found...

1640
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:20,410
and hid the bag of gold
beneath the tree.

1641
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:22,907
I played the cheater
for thy father's hand,

1642
02:08:22,987 --> 02:08:25,240
and when I had it,
drew myself apart...

1643
02:08:25,323 --> 02:08:28,452
and almost broke my heart
with extreme laughter.

1644
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:31,538
And when I told the empress
of this sport,

1645
02:08:31,621 --> 02:08:34,295
she swooned almost
at my pleasing tale,

1646
02:08:34,373 --> 02:08:37,217
and for my tidings
gave me 20 kisses.

1647
02:08:37,293 --> 02:08:38,966
What?

1648
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,508
Canst thou say all this
and never blush?

1649
02:08:43,591 --> 02:08:48,267
Ay, like a black dog,
as the saying is.

1650
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:57,154
Art thou not sorry
for these heinous deeds?

1651
02:08:57,230 --> 02:08:59,608
Ay.

1652
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:02,364
That I had not done
a thousand more.

1653
02:09:05,738 --> 02:09:09,788
Even now, I curse the day-

1654
02:09:09,867 --> 02:09:13,497
and yet, I think, few come
within the compass of my curse-

1655
02:09:13,579 --> 02:09:16,924
wherein I did not
some notorious ill as kill a man...

1656
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:19,172
or else devise his death;

1657
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:22,222
ravish a maid
or plot the way to do it;

1658
02:09:22,296 --> 02:09:25,425
accuse some innocent
and forswear myself;

1659
02:09:25,508 --> 02:09:27,931
make poor men's cattle
break their necks;

1660
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,638
set fire on barns
and haystacks in the night...

1661
02:09:30,721 --> 02:09:34,771
and bid the owners
quench them with their tears.

1662
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:38,605
Oft have I digged up dead
men from their graves...

1663
02:09:38,688 --> 02:09:41,532
and set them upright
at their dear friends' doors,

1664
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:44,861
even when their sorrows
almost was forgot.

1665
02:09:45,861 --> 02:09:49,365
And on their skins,
as on the barks of trees,

1666
02:09:49,448 --> 02:09:52,827
have with my knife
carved in Roman letters,

1667
02:09:52,910 --> 02:09:57,086
"Let not thy sorrow die,
though I am dead!"

1668
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:06,925
Tut.

1669
02:10:08,634 --> 02:10:11,558
I have done
a thousand dreadful things...

1670
02:10:11,637 --> 02:10:15,232
as willingly
as one would kill a fly.

1671
02:10:15,308 --> 02:10:18,187
And nothing grieves me
heartily indeed...

1672
02:10:19,186 --> 02:10:21,905
but that I cannot do
10,000 more.

1673
02:10:22,982 --> 02:10:24,780
Bring down the devil-

1674
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,994
for he must
not die so sweet a death...

1675
02:10:27,069 --> 02:10:29,037
as hanging presently.

1676
02:10:32,992 --> 02:10:36,166
If there be devils,
would I were a devil...

1677
02:10:36,245 --> 02:10:38,339
to live and burn
in everlasting fire...

1678
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,542
that I might have
your company in hell...

1679
02:10:40,624 --> 02:10:43,002
but to torment you
with my bitter tongue!

1680
02:10:43,085 --> 02:10:45,964
Sirs, stop his mouth!

1681
02:10:46,047 --> 02:10:48,391
Let him speak no more!

1682
02:10:54,347 --> 02:10:57,226
My lord, there's
a messenger from Rome.

1683
02:11:00,353 --> 02:11:02,526
Welcome, Aemelius.

1684
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:07,280
What news from Rome?

1685
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:10,364
Lord Lucius,
and you princes of the Goths,

1686
02:11:10,446 --> 02:11:12,574
the Roman emperor
greets you all by me and,

1687
02:11:12,656 --> 02:11:14,283
for he understands
you are in arms,

1688
02:11:14,367 --> 02:11:17,462
craves a parley
at your father's house.

1689
02:11:17,536 --> 02:11:19,664
Willing you to demand
your hostages,

1690
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,374
and they shall be
immediately delivered.

1691
02:11:21,457 --> 02:11:23,380
What says our general?

1692
02:11:23,459 --> 02:11:27,305
Aemelius, let the emperor
give his pledges unto my father...

1693
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:29,929
and my uncle Marcus,
and we will come.

1694
02:12:25,396 --> 02:12:28,366
Who doth molest
my contemplation?

1695
02:12:30,609 --> 02:12:33,112
Is it your trick
to make me ope the door...

1696
02:12:33,195 --> 02:12:36,790
that so my sad decrees
may fly away...

1697
02:12:36,866 --> 02:12:39,870
and all my study be
to no effect?

1698
02:12:41,203 --> 02:12:43,080
Huh?

1699
02:12:43,164 --> 02:12:45,713
You are deceived,
for what I mean to do,

1700
02:12:45,791 --> 02:12:50,046
see here in bloody lines
I have set down.

1701
02:12:52,673 --> 02:12:55,893
And what is written
shall be executed.

1702
02:13:07,146 --> 02:13:08,648
Titus,

1703
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:13,236
I am come to talk with thee.

1704
02:13:15,196 --> 02:13:19,201
No. Not a word.

1705
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:23,413
If thou didst know me,
thou wouldst talk with me.

1706
02:13:23,496 --> 02:13:26,045
I am not mad.
I know thee well enough...

1707
02:13:26,123 --> 02:13:29,127
for our proud empress
mighty Tamora.

1708
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:31,338
Is not thy coming
for my other hand?

1709
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:36,176
Know, thou sad man,
I am not Tamora.

1710
02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:39,478
She is thy enemy
and I thy friend.

1711
02:13:39,553 --> 02:13:43,979
I am Revenge, sent
from the infernal kingdom,

1712
02:13:44,058 --> 02:13:47,608
accompanied by Rape
and Murder here-

1713
02:13:49,605 --> 02:13:53,235
To ease the gnawing vulture
of thy mind...

1714
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:59,707
by working wreakful
vengeance on thy foes.

1715
02:13:59,782 --> 02:14:04,879
Come down and welcome me
to this world's light.

1716
02:14:04,954 --> 02:14:09,300
Confer with me on murder
and on death.

1717
02:14:18,968 --> 02:14:21,721
Art thou Revenge,
and art thou sent to me...

1718
02:14:21,804 --> 02:14:23,727
to be a torment
to mine enemies?

1719
02:14:23,806 --> 02:14:26,810
I am.
Therefore come down...

1720
02:14:26,892 --> 02:14:29,987
and welcome me
and my ministers.

1721
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:31,689
Good lord!

1722
02:14:31,772 --> 02:14:34,070
How like the empress' sons
they are,

1723
02:14:34,149 --> 02:14:36,572
and you the empress!

1724
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:41,123
But we worldly men have
miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.

1725
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:45,829
Oh, sweet Revenge,
now do I come to thee.

1726
02:14:45,911 --> 02:14:48,414
And if one arm's embracement
will content thee,

1727
02:14:48,497 --> 02:14:51,091
I will embrace thee in it
by and by!

1728
02:14:55,796 --> 02:14:58,345
This closing
with him fits his lunacy.

1729
02:14:58,424 --> 02:15:02,099
Whate'er I forge to feed
his brainsick fits,

1730
02:15:02,177 --> 02:15:05,397
do you uphold and maintain
in your speeches,

1731
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:07,645
for now he firmly
takes me for Revenge.

1732
02:15:07,725 --> 02:15:12,105
And-- being credulous
in this mad thought-

1733
02:15:14,607 --> 02:15:16,530
I'll make him send
for his son Lucius.

1734
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:18,327
Shh! Shh!

1735
02:15:20,195 --> 02:15:23,039
See?
Here he comes.

1736
02:15:24,742 --> 02:15:26,744
And I must ply my theme.

1737
02:15:28,370 --> 02:15:30,998
Long have I been forlorn,
and all for thee.

1738
02:15:31,081 --> 02:15:34,005
Welcome, dread fury,
to my woeful house.

1739
02:15:34,084 --> 02:15:37,054
Rapine and Murder,
you are welcome too.

1740
02:15:39,548 --> 02:15:43,178
How like the empress
and her sons you are.

1741
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:46,013
Well are you fitted,
had you but a Moor.

1742
02:15:46,096 --> 02:15:49,225
Could not all hell
afford you such a devil?

1743
02:15:49,308 --> 02:15:52,687
What wouldst thou
have us do, Andronicus?

1744
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:55,398
Show me a murderer,
and I'll deal with him.

1745
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:59,239
Show me a villain
that hath done a rape,

1746
02:15:59,318 --> 02:16:01,821
and I am sent
to be revenged on him.

1747
02:16:03,822 --> 02:16:06,541
Look round about
the wicked streets of Rome.

1748
02:16:06,617 --> 02:16:08,961
When thou findst a man
that's like thyself,

1749
02:16:09,036 --> 02:16:11,414
good Murder, stab him.

1750
02:16:12,665 --> 02:16:14,667
He's a murderer.

1751
02:16:15,918 --> 02:16:17,090
Hmm?

1752
02:16:23,592 --> 02:16:27,597
Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap
to find another that is like to thee,

1753
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:29,603
good Rapine, stab him!

1754
02:16:29,723 --> 02:16:31,896
He's a ravisher.

1755
02:16:38,357 --> 02:16:40,860
Go thou with them,
and in the emperor's court,

1756
02:16:40,943 --> 02:16:43,537
there is a queen
attended by a Moor.

1757
02:16:43,612 --> 02:16:45,956
Well mayst thou know her
by thy own proportion,

1758
02:16:46,031 --> 02:16:49,285
for up and down
she doth resemble thee.

1759
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:56,675
I pray thee, do on them
some violent death.

1760
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:59,799
They have been violent
to me and mine.

1761
02:16:59,878 --> 02:17:02,722
Well hast thou lessoned us.

1762
02:17:02,798 --> 02:17:05,221
This shall we do.

1763
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:10,852
But... would it please thee,
good Andronicus,

1764
02:17:10,931 --> 02:17:14,731
to send for Lucius,
thy thrice valiant son,

1765
02:17:14,810 --> 02:17:18,906
and bid him come
and banquet at thy house?

1766
02:17:18,981 --> 02:17:22,281
I will bring in
the empress and her sons,

1767
02:17:22,359 --> 02:17:26,956
the emperor himself,
and all thy foes.

1768
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:30,079
And at thy mercy-

1769
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:32,161
Oh.

1770
02:17:32,244 --> 02:17:37,000
shall they stoop and kneel,

1771
02:17:37,082 --> 02:17:42,555
and on them shalt thou
ease thy angry heart.

1772
02:17:43,839 --> 02:17:46,683
What says Andronicus
to this device?

1773
02:17:50,512 --> 02:17:53,106
Marcus, my brother?

1774
02:17:53,182 --> 02:17:55,526
'Tis sad Titus calls.

1775
02:18:00,856 --> 02:18:03,359
Go, gentle Marcus,
to thy nephew Lucius.

1776
02:18:03,442 --> 02:18:05,865
Thou shalt inquire him
out among the Goths.

1777
02:18:05,944 --> 02:18:07,912
Bid him repair to me
and bring with him...

1778
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:10,707
some of the chiefest
princes of the Goths.

1779
02:18:10,783 --> 02:18:13,502
Tell him the emperor and the
empress, too, feast at my house,

1780
02:18:13,577 --> 02:18:15,420
and he shall feast with them.

1781
02:18:15,496 --> 02:18:17,214
This do thou for my love,

1782
02:18:17,289 --> 02:18:20,793
and so let him, as he regards
his aged father's life.

1783
02:18:22,127 --> 02:18:25,882
This will I do
and soon return again.

1784
02:18:30,427 --> 02:18:33,055
Now will I hence
about thy business...

1785
02:18:33,138 --> 02:18:35,482
and take my ministers
along with me.

1786
02:18:35,557 --> 02:18:37,184
Nay, nay-

1787
02:18:37,267 --> 02:18:40,237
Let Rape and Murder
stay with me,

1788
02:18:40,312 --> 02:18:42,189
or else I'll call my brother
back again...

1789
02:18:42,272 --> 02:18:45,993
and cleave to no revenge
but Lucius.

1790
02:18:46,068 --> 02:18:48,366
What say you, boys?
Will you abide with him...

1791
02:18:48,445 --> 02:18:50,163
whiles I go tell
my lord the emperor...

1792
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:52,992
how I have governed
our determined jest?

1793
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:57,129
Madam, depart at pleasure.

1794
02:18:57,204 --> 02:18:58,877
Leave us here.

1795
02:19:01,083 --> 02:19:03,427
Farewell, Andronicus.

1796
02:19:03,502 --> 02:19:06,426
Revenge now goes
to lay a complot...

1797
02:19:06,505 --> 02:19:08,178
to betray thy foes.

1798
02:19:08,257 --> 02:19:09,850
I know thou dost,

1799
02:19:09,925 --> 02:19:13,600
and, sweet Revenge, farewell.

1800
02:19:25,107 --> 02:19:29,157
Tell us, old man,
how shall we be employed?

1801
02:19:29,236 --> 02:19:31,955
Tut. I have work
well enough for you.

1802
02:19:33,824 --> 02:19:37,954
Come hither,
Publius, Caius, Valentin!

1803
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:46,886
What is your will?

1804
02:19:46,962 --> 02:19:48,930
Know you these two?

1805
02:19:49,006 --> 02:19:51,725
The empress' sons, I take them-
Chiron and Demetrius.

1806
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:54,019
Fie, Publius, fie!
Thou art too much deceived.

1807
02:19:54,094 --> 02:19:56,267
The one is Murder.
Rape is the other's name.

1808
02:19:56,346 --> 02:19:59,395
And therefore bind them,
gentle Publius.

1809
02:19:59,474 --> 02:20:01,647
Caius and Valentin,
lay hands on them.

1810
02:20:02,895 --> 02:20:05,193
Villains, forbear!

1811
02:20:05,272 --> 02:20:07,400
We are thy empress' sons!

1812
02:20:07,482 --> 02:20:09,780
And therefore do
we what we are commanded.

1813
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:23,673
Come. Come, Lavinia.

1814
02:20:25,042 --> 02:20:27,136
Look.

1815
02:20:27,210 --> 02:20:29,463
Thy foes are bound.

1816
02:20:32,257 --> 02:20:35,352
Now let them hear
what fearful words I utter.

1817
02:20:37,387 --> 02:20:41,813
O villains
Chiron and Demetrius.

1818
02:20:41,892 --> 02:20:46,272
Here stands the spring
whom you have stained with mud-

1819
02:20:46,355 --> 02:20:48,983
this goodly summer
with your winter mixed.

1820
02:20:51,109 --> 02:20:54,409
You killed her husband,
and for that vile fault...

1821
02:20:54,488 --> 02:20:56,490
two of her brothers
were condemned to death,

1822
02:20:56,573 --> 02:20:59,793
my hand cut off
and made a merry jest.

1823
02:20:59,868 --> 02:21:02,371
Both her sweet hands,
her tongue,

1824
02:21:02,454 --> 02:21:04,456
and that more dear
than hands or tongue-

1825
02:21:04,539 --> 02:21:07,213
her spotless chastity-

1826
02:21:07,292 --> 02:21:11,638
inhuman traitors,
you constrained and forced.

1827
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:17,219
What would you say
if I should let you speak?

1828
02:21:17,302 --> 02:21:21,603
Villains, for shame,
you could not beg for grace.

1829
02:21:24,601 --> 02:21:26,979
Hark, wretches,
how I mean to martyr you.

1830
02:21:27,062 --> 02:21:29,360
This one hand yet is left
to cut your throats,

1831
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:33,444
whilst that Lavinia between
her stumps doth hold...

1832
02:21:33,527 --> 02:21:35,780
the basin that receives
your guilty blood.

1833
02:21:40,242 --> 02:21:42,244
You know your mother means
to feast with me...

1834
02:21:42,327 --> 02:21:45,501
and calls herself Revenge
and thinks me mad.

1835
02:21:48,083 --> 02:21:50,336
Hark, villains.

1836
02:21:50,419 --> 02:21:54,469
I shall grind your bones to dust,

1837
02:21:54,548 --> 02:21:58,223
and with your blood and it
I'll make a paste.

1838
02:21:58,301 --> 02:22:00,599
And of the paste
a coffin I will rear...

1839
02:22:00,679 --> 02:22:04,434
and make two pastries
of your shameful heads,

1840
02:22:04,516 --> 02:22:07,770
and bid that strumpet
your unhallowed dam,

1841
02:22:07,853 --> 02:22:11,858
like to the earth,
swallow her own increase.

1842
02:22:29,708 --> 02:22:32,803
This is the feast
that I have bid her to...

1843
02:22:32,878 --> 02:22:35,802
and this the banquet
she shall surfeit on.

1844
02:22:41,386 --> 02:22:43,388
And now prepare your throats.

1845
02:22:55,901 --> 02:22:57,869
Lavinia, come.

1846
02:23:06,328 --> 02:23:08,330
Receive the blood.

1847
02:23:12,876 --> 02:23:17,598
Come. Come, be everyone officious
to make this banquet...

1848
02:23:17,672 --> 02:23:19,720
which I wish may prove...

1849
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:23,475
more stern and bloody
than the centaur's feast.

1850
02:23:30,143 --> 02:23:31,269
So...

1851
02:23:31,353 --> 02:23:36,234
now cut them down,
for I shall play the cook...

1852
02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:41,364
and see them ready
'gainst their mother comes.

1853
02:24:11,810 --> 02:24:16,566
The feast is ready, which the careful
Titus hath ordained to an honorable end-

1854
02:24:16,648 --> 02:24:20,573
for peace, for love, for league,
and good to Rome.

1855
02:24:20,652 --> 02:24:22,404
Please you, therefore,
draw nigh...

1856
02:24:22,487 --> 02:24:24,330
and take your places.

1857
02:24:24,406 --> 02:24:27,751
Marcus, we will.

1858
02:24:46,094 --> 02:24:48,188
Welcome, my gracious lord.

1859
02:24:48,263 --> 02:24:51,233
Welcome, dread queen.
Welcome, ye warlike Goths.

1860
02:24:51,308 --> 02:24:54,107
Welcome, Lucius.

1861
02:24:54,186 --> 02:24:56,188
And welcome, all.

1862
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:01,740
Although the cheer be poor,
'twill fill your stomachs.

1863
02:25:01,818 --> 02:25:04,571
Please you eat of it.

1864
02:25:04,654 --> 02:25:06,748
Why art thou thus attired,

1865
02:25:07,574 --> 02:25:09,326
Andronicus? Hmm?

1866
02:25:09,409 --> 02:25:11,036
Because I would be sure
to have all well...

1867
02:25:11,119 --> 02:25:13,247
to entertain your highness
and your empress.

1868
02:25:21,796 --> 02:25:24,925
We are beholden to you,
good Andronicus.

1869
02:25:25,008 --> 02:25:28,057
And if your highness
knew my heart, you were.

1870
02:25:43,401 --> 02:25:45,074
Will it please you eat?

1871
02:25:45,153 --> 02:25:47,372
Will it please
your highness feed?

1872
02:27:14,075 --> 02:27:16,794
My lord the emperor.

1873
02:27:16,911 --> 02:27:19,539
Hmm?
Resolve me this.

1874
02:27:19,622 --> 02:27:22,592
Was it well done
of rash Virginius...

1875
02:27:22,667 --> 02:27:25,011
to slay his daughter
with his own right hand...

1876
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,595
because she was enforced,
stained, and deflowered?

1877
02:27:30,759 --> 02:27:32,261
It was, Andronicus.

1878
02:27:32,802 --> 02:27:35,476
Your reason, mighty lord?

1879
02:27:36,556 --> 02:27:38,558
Because the girl
should not survive her shame...

1880
02:27:38,641 --> 02:27:41,064
and by her presence
still renew his sorrows.

1881
02:27:41,144 --> 02:27:43,363
Ah.

1882
02:27:43,438 --> 02:27:48,945
A reason mighty,
strong, and effectual.

1883
02:27:52,197 --> 02:27:57,829
A pattern, precedent,
and lively warrant...

1884
02:27:57,911 --> 02:28:03,213
for me, most wretched,
to perform the like.

1885
02:28:04,209 --> 02:28:06,553
Die, die, Lavinia,

1886
02:28:06,628 --> 02:28:08,881
and thy shame with thee.

1887
02:28:13,134 --> 02:28:15,057
What hast thou done-

1888
02:28:15,136 --> 02:28:18,106
Unnatural and unkind?

1889
02:28:19,224 --> 02:28:23,855
Killed her for whom my tears
have made me blind.

1890
02:28:26,564 --> 02:28:29,784
I am as woeful
as Virginius was...

1891
02:28:29,859 --> 02:28:32,282
and have a thousand times
more cause than he...

1892
02:28:32,362 --> 02:28:34,330
to do this outrage,

1893
02:28:34,406 --> 02:28:37,285
and it now is done.

1894
02:28:38,326 --> 02:28:41,921
What, was she ravished?
Tell who did the deed.

1895
02:28:41,996 --> 02:28:45,626
Why hast thou slain
thine only daughter thus?

1896
02:28:46,459 --> 02:28:48,928
Not I.

1897
02:28:49,003 --> 02:28:51,097
'Twas Chiron and Demetrius.

1898
02:28:51,172 --> 02:28:53,641
They ravished her
and cut away her tongue.

1899
02:28:53,716 --> 02:28:56,811
And they, 'twas they...

1900
02:28:56,886 --> 02:28:58,684
that did her all this wrong.

1901
02:28:58,763 --> 02:29:00,606
Go fetch them to us
hither presently!

1902
02:29:00,682 --> 02:29:04,778
Why, there they are,
both baked in that pie...

1903
02:29:04,853 --> 02:29:07,106
whereof their mother
daintily hath fed-

1904
02:29:08,022 --> 02:29:11,117
Eating the flesh
that she herself hath bred!

1905
02:29:11,192 --> 02:29:15,698
'Tis true. 'Tis true!
Witness my knife's sharp point.

1906
02:30:47,205 --> 02:30:49,708
You sad-faced men,

1907
02:30:49,791 --> 02:30:54,422
people and sons of Rome
by uproar severed...

1908
02:30:54,504 --> 02:30:57,724
like a flight of fowl
scattered by winds...

1909
02:30:57,799 --> 02:31:00,302
and high tempestuous gusts,

1910
02:31:01,177 --> 02:31:03,646
oh, let me teach you
how to knit again...

1911
02:31:03,721 --> 02:31:07,396
this scattered corn
into one mutual sheaf,

1912
02:31:08,059 --> 02:31:11,905
these broken limbs
again into one body.

1913
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:15,735
Come. Come,
you reverend men of Rome,

1914
02:31:15,817 --> 02:31:19,572
and take our emperor
gently by the hand-

1915
02:31:19,654 --> 02:31:23,329
Lucius our emperor,

1916
02:31:23,408 --> 02:31:28,005
for well I know the common voice
do cry it shall be so.

1917
02:31:35,003 --> 02:31:37,301
Now is my turn to speak.

1918
02:31:39,173 --> 02:31:41,267
Behold this child.

1919
02:31:41,342 --> 02:31:43,891
Of this was
Tamora delivered-

1920
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:47,270
the issue
of an irreligious Moor,

1921
02:31:47,348 --> 02:31:50,101
chief architect
and plotter of our woes.

1922
02:31:50,893 --> 02:31:53,316
O thou sad Andronicus,

1923
02:31:53,396 --> 02:31:55,865
give sentence
on this execrable wretch.

1924
02:32:02,864 --> 02:32:04,707
Set him breast-deep in earth
and famish him.

1925
02:32:07,035 --> 02:32:11,336
There let him stand
and rave and cry for food.

1926
02:32:12,165 --> 02:32:14,543
If anyone relieves or pities him,

1927
02:32:14,626 --> 02:32:17,630
for the offense he dies.

1928
02:32:23,384 --> 02:32:25,352
This is our doom.

1929
02:32:28,723 --> 02:32:33,900
Oh, why should wrath be mute
and fury dumb?

1930
02:32:36,189 --> 02:32:38,908
I am no baby, I,

1931
02:32:38,983 --> 02:32:40,656
that with base prayers...

1932
02:32:40,735 --> 02:32:43,614
I should repent the evils
I have done.

1933
02:32:45,740 --> 02:32:49,244
If one good deed
in all my life I did...

1934
02:32:52,163 --> 02:32:56,339
I do repent it
from my very soul.

1935
02:33:05,259 --> 02:33:07,307
Go, some of you.

1936
02:33:07,387 --> 02:33:11,358
Bear Saturninus hence, and give
him burial in his father's grave.

1937
02:33:13,101 --> 02:33:15,650
My father and Lavinia...

1938
02:33:15,728 --> 02:33:18,732
shall forthwith be closed
in our household monument.

1939
02:33:21,484 --> 02:33:24,579
As for that ravenous
tiger Tamora,

1940
02:33:26,447 --> 02:33:29,417
no funeral rite,

1941
02:33:29,492 --> 02:33:32,245
no man in mourning weeds,

1942
02:33:32,328 --> 02:33:35,548
nor mournful bell
shall ring her burial,

1943
02:33:36,708 --> 02:33:41,509
but throw her forth
to beasts and birds of prey.

1944
02:33:41,587 --> 02:33:44,591
Her life was beast-like...

1945
02:33:44,674 --> 02:33:46,847
and devoid of pity.

1946
02:33:48,010 --> 02:33:49,978
And, being dead,

1947
02:33:52,682 --> 02:33:55,105
let birds on her take pity.

1948
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,141
