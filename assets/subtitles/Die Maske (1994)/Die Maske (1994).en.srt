1
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,403
"Edge City"

2
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,867
Another one coming down.

3
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:52,118
Hang on.

4
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:41,959
THE MASK

5
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:56,015
I got those...

6
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,308
concert tickets you wanted.

7
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,811
You're kidding!

8
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:00,687
For Friday night?

9
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,649
Stanley, this is great.

10
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,317
What time do I pick you up?

11
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:08,319
Here's the thing.

12
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:12,115
My best girlfriend is here
and she'd die to go to this...

13
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,952
so could we get an extra ticket
for her?

14
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:20,332
They're sold out. That means
there's no more.

15
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,585
I can't let her sit home all alone.

16
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,632
I'll tell you what.

17
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,175
Go with your friend.

18
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,762
I couldn't do that.

19
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,222
No, come on.

20
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,850
Stanley, you are the nicest guy.

21
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,018
Really, you are.

22
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:44,940
- Isn't he the nicest guy?
- The best.

23
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:51,697
That was the most sickening display

24
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,284
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree.

25
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,952
I'm wearing her down.

26
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:00,331
Buddy, you need a little
change of pace.

27
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:03,375
Tonight, I'll take you
on a love safari.

28
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,879
Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungle.

29
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,964
Tell me more, bwana.

30
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:12,885
The Coco Bongo Club.
Hottest new joint in town.

31
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,429
Only the crême de la crême
need apply.

32
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,766
- How do we get in?
- Are you kidding?

33
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,185
Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy.

34
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,479
This will be the perfect...

35
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:25,898
night on the town.

36
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,580
Hold the phone.

37
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:43,792
Killer at three o'clock.

38
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,907
Stand back and observe.

39
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,412
Where do I open an account?

40
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:22,247
New accounts,right here.

41
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,790
You're lucky, I was on my way out--

42
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,500
Hold this for me, please?

43
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,795
I'll hold anything you want.

44
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:33,258
Can you help me?

45
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,077
So...

46
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:03,329
what kind of account do you want?

47
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:07,709
Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
just terrible with things like that.

48
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,087
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

49
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,549
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss.

50
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:15,217
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.

51
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,011
Pleasure's all mine.

52
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:19,013
May l?

53
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:20,431
What?

54
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:22,349
I'm such a mess.

55
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:25,018
Oh, of course.

56
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,355
That's what they're there for.

57
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,652
As I was saying, that tie...

58
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:37,740
reminds me of those,
what do you call it, ink blot tests.

59
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:40,743
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.

60
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:42,995
It sort of looks like...

61
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:45,915
a young woman riding bareback.

62
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:48,000
Sort of...

63
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:49,627
Lady Godiva or something.

64
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,546
Of course.

65
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,092
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

66
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,096
I don't know.

67
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:14,111
Bright colors...

68
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,695
It's a power tie.

69
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,614
Supposed to make you feel...

70
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:19,741
powerful.

71
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,243
Does it work?

72
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:29,542
Now, how about that account?

73
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,751
We have...

74
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,920
several different plans.

75
00:06:33,003 --> 00:06:34,296
Savings.

76
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:39,927
Checking.

77
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,554
Savings and checking.

78
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,890
Savings and CD's.

79
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:45,267
Checking and CD's.

80
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,270
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills.

81
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:51,189
Or we can throw your money
in a big mattress.

82
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,365
Now, I have some forms
for you to fill out.

83
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:11,208
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right.

84
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,210
Keep it down back there.

85
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:15,964
We'll try.

86
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:19,217
- What do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But...

87
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:22,179
the motion detectors are a pain.

88
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,514
But you can pull this off, right?

89
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,517
You talking to the Doctor.

90
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,520
I do have one question.

91
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:31,397
Which is?

92
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:33,983
What's Niko have to say about this?

93
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,609
Nothing.

94
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:39,529
- This isn't his grift.
- Get real, man.

95
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,490
Everything is his grift.

96
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:45,786
He owns you, he owns this club,
he owns this whole stinking town.

97
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:49,247
Things change.

98
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:53,168
You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap.

99
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:57,005
He's the only one who's napping...

100
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,844
and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up call.

101
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:04,013
But we need cash...

102
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,349
so first we take the bank...

103
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,892
then we take Niko...

104
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:10,227
and then, my friend,
school is out.

105
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:14,690
And this whole city is our playground.

106
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,990
Bub, watch where you're going!

107
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,174
Hang on, hang on!

108
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,510
Don't get your panties in a twist.

109
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,805
What the hell is it?

110
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:48,015
I don't know...

111
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,309
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

112
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:54,105
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

113
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,149
I'm here for the Civic.

114
00:08:56,232 --> 00:09:00,070
The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission.

115
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:01,822
What?!

116
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:03,906
All I wanted was an oil change.

117
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,161
Lucky we caught these problems
before they caused serious trouble.

118
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:12,123
Sign right here, and press down hard.

119
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,793
- There's no price.
- There will be.

120
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,380
I've no car.
I need a car tonight.

121
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:23,885
Bring around the loaner.

122
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,803
The loaner?

123
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,972
The loaner?

124
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,588
It's a classic.

125
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:13,143
Gals, meet my buddy Stanley Ipkiss.

126
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:16,606
Humungo in the banking business.

127
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,817
- Not really.
- Let's get in this joint.

128
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:23,862
How you doing, buddy?

129
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:26,697
- It's Charlie!
- How you doing?

130
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:29,326
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see.

131
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,995
Good to see you.

132
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,831
Come on, gals.

133
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:35,958
See you on the inside.

134
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:47,303
This is a mistake.

135
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:53,226
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

136
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:56,437
- My friends are inside.
- Lose him.

137
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,230
This isn't fair.

138
00:10:58,313 --> 00:10:59,566
Watch it, I'm a bleeder.

139
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,819
Put me down now, or I am
never coming back here.

140
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:15,206
Jeez.

141
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,181
Mr. Ipkiss!

142
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,974
Hi.

143
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:35,894
Are you okay?

144
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:37,562
Me?

145
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:38,897
I'm great..

146
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,898
Really good.

147
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,233
I never felt better, really.

148
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:44,319
I'm just...

149
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:45,653
catching some air.

150
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:47,572
Your car, sir.

151
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:49,991
That's not my car.

152
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,659
It matches the ticket.

153
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,207
Alright...

154
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,293
I'll take it.

155
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,171
But I am very angry!

156
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:06,257
Believe this?

157
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,886
You drive in in a Porsche...

158
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,534
Hey, Mister!

159
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:00,207
Hold on!

160
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,460
I know CPR!

161
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,416
Hey, you!

162
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:45,002
What are you doing down there?

163
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:49,673
I'm just looking for...

164
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,634
my mask!

165
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,429
I got it.

166
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:07,816
Do you have any idea what time it is?

167
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:09,609
Actually, no.

168
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,947
My new carpet!

169
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,827
Well ,this is coming right out
of your security deposit.

170
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:19,911
You know...

171
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:21,121
What?

172
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,042
Nothing.

173
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:29,504
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss,
a big nothing.

174
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:37,638
Aren't you due at the lab
to get your bolts tightened?

175
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:41,434
I should have said that.

176
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,777
Hey, you.

177
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,694
Milo!

178
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:56,364
No jumping up allowed.
It's against doggie ordinance.

179
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:22,851
What do you want?

180
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:24,727
You want me to throw that?

181
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:26,394
I'm very tired.

182
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:29,231
I'll throw it one time.

183
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:32,318
I won't throw it with you
attached to it.

184
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:37,615
You ready?

185
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:39,242
Get it.

186
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:40,493
Ipkiss!

187
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:42,829
Turn down those cartoons!

188
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:45,374
Alright, Mrs. Peenman!

189
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:54,174
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody
wears a mask?

190
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:55,968
That's correct.

191
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:59,011
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking.

192
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:02,099
We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

193
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:05,143
and adopt a more socially
acceptable image.

194
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:09,480
The book is "The Masks We Wear"
by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

195
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:11,315
Thank you for being here.

196
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:17,698
What's the matter with you?

197
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:18,907
What is it?

198
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,244
What are you looking for?

199
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:25,289
You like this thing? You like it?

200
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,126
"The Masks We Wear".

201
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,464
"That's correct.

202
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:37,134
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking".

203
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,311
Yeah, right.

204
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,520
Smoking!

205
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:33,608
It's party time.

206
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,068
P-A-R-T-Y

207
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:38,278
Why? Because I gotta.

208
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,038
MANAGER

209
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,873
QUIET PLEASE

210
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:24,117
Snooze!

211
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,562
Look, ma, I'm road kill!

212
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:04,867
- Get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate.

213
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:07,703
squeeze me gently

214
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:26,638
Hey, mister...

215
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:28,681
you got the time?

216
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:31,352
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

217
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:36,732
Look at that!

218
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:40,903
Time to honk your nose and pull
your underwear over your head.

219
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,161
Come on!

220
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,171
Step right up here, don't be shy!

221
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:00,423
Nobody likes...

222
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:02,801
a bashful leather head.

223
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:03,927
Move it!

224
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,387
For my first trick...

225
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,807
I'll do something for you, son.

226
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:17,357
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

227
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:21,486
Now...

228
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:24,488
Sorry, wrong pocket.

229
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:25,865
For you...

230
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,868
a little body English.

231
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:35,125
A French poodle.

232
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:39,421
The dog was rabid, had to put it down.

233
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:43,633
At last but not least, my favorite.

234
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:57,271
A Tommy gun.

235
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:11,536
This is incredible.

236
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:14,206
With these powers I could be...

237
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,170
a superhero.

238
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,339
I'd fight crime,
protect the innocent...

239
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,051
work for world peace.

240
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,718
But first...

241
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:29,929
RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING

242
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:36,603
Hold onto your lug nuts...

243
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:39,689
it's time for an overhaul.

244
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,613
It was a dream.

245
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,618
It was a dream.

246
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,498
I must lay off the cartoons.

247
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,555
Lt. Kellaway. You know anything
about the disturbance last night?

248
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:56,267
Disturbance?

249
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,604
Some prowler broke in
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

250
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:01,148
Attacked?

251
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,858
You didn't hear anything?

252
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:07,236
She unloaded a couple of rounds
of buckshot 5 feet from here.

253
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,405
Look at the floor.

254
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,949
He put that right in my floor,
then he jumped out...

255
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,495
the window. Officer,
are you writing notes?

256
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:17,372
This is...

257
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,624
impossible.

258
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,543
Those pyjamas are impossible.
This happened.

259
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,297
See, I have...

260
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,507
an inner ear problem.

261
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,804
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- Is that so?

262
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:39,478
Here's my card. If you recall
anything unusual about last night...

263
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,105
anything at all, call me.

264
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:43,815
You bet. Thank you.

265
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:45,983
And good luck...

266
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,320
cracking the case.

267
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,045
Oh, my God, I'm late!

268
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,297
Keys, keys...

269
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,174
Where's the keys?

270
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,510
Damn.

271
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,429
Get the keys.

272
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,680
Find them.

273
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,894
Get the keys.

274
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,614
I am so late.

275
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,743
Good boy.

276
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:39,080
Come on, Milo. Give them to me.
Drop it.

277
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,573
I want a proctologist standing by.

278
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,658
The best one you can find.

279
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,579
Can you tell me what happened?

280
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:22,415
- No, you can quote me.
- Looks like some Mob tactic.

281
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:26,794
She broke the case. Come on,
get these rubbernecks out of here.

282
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,432
Where were you last night?
We looked all over for you.

283
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,435
Did you happen to look outside,
in the gutter?

284
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,062
Did you check the paper?

285
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,939
Your girlfriend got a great review.

286
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,067
Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo

287
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,986
You're 50 minutes late.
That's like stealing.

288
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:55,782
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never
happen again. I've been a jerk.

289
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,618
If you weren't busy oogling
girlie pictures...

290
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,995
you might get some work done.

291
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,875
Sir. She's a perspective
client of Stanley's.

292
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,377
Really?

293
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,133
The next time she comes in...

294
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,676
send her to my office.

295
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:17,972
You bet.

296
00:27:22,685 --> 00:27:25,229
Gee, I wish "my" daddy
owned a bank.

297
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,565
Then I could be a rich
little creep too.

298
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,525
You think she'll ever come back?

299
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:34,196
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.

300
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,908
Girls like her always look for
the BBD: Bigger Better Deal.

301
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:40,244
You don't know that.

302
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:43,372
She's an artist. She's...

303
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,666
- sensitive.
- Forget her.

304
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:49,837
She'll rip out your heart,
put it in a blender and hit "frappe".

305
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:53,758
You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth.

306
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:57,928
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

307
00:27:58,012 --> 00:27:59,262
red hair...

308
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,222
full, pouting lips...

309
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,601
a white blouse, green jacket...

310
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:04,935
and a name tag.

311
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,271
You really narrowed it down.

312
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,523
Too bad she's already taken.

313
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,028
Hello there, may I be of assistance?

314
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,155
Stanley Ipkiss?

315
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,787
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune.

316
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:27,708
I canceled my subscription because
they kept stealing--

317
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,628
No, actually, I want to ask you
a few questions.

318
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,380
Really? About what?

319
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:37,134
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?

320
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,388
Me?

321
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:44,433
I don't even have a car.

322
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:47,145
You know, 'cause they pollute.

323
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:49,689
You don't own an '89 Civic?

324
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,944
Oh, that car, yeah.

325
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:58,532
It's coming back to me.

326
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:01,076
Miss... What was your name?

327
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:02,411
Peggy Brandt.

328
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:04,704
Wait a minute.

329
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:06,498
Peggy Brandt?

330
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,082
Of "Ask Peggy"?

331
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,918
That's right.

332
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,921
You printed one of my letters
last year.

333
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:16,465
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."

334
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:19,052
You're Mister Nice Guy?

335
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:25,767
Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

336
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:29,187
100's of women are looking
for a guy like you.

337
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:33,443
Really?

338
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:36,654
You know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

339
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:39,448
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.

340
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:47,205
Why are you covering this story?

341
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:51,001
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

342
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:53,253
I'm looking to become a real reporter.

343
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:57,340
When you were at Ripley Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

344
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:58,633
Anything?

345
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:00,677
I won't make trouble for you.

346
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,263
I just want the truth.

347
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:07,602
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do.

348
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:13,482
If you think of anything...

349
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:15,400
this is my number.

350
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,278
This is my...

351
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:19,781
you know, personal number.

352
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,452
100's of women are looking
for a guy like me?

353
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:25,870
Sure.

354
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:28,830
I'm one of them.

355
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,175
120 yards.

356
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:45,972
Hello, Dorian.

357
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,896
Thanks for dropping by.

358
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:56,275
Next time, call.
Leave the delivery boys at home.

359
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,882
The cops...

360
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:23,803
tried to shut the club
down this morning.

361
00:31:23,886 --> 00:31:28,558
They say you've been using the place
to run your own small-time scams.

362
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,144
When I hear things like that...

363
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:34,690
I start losing my concentration.

364
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:37,401
My game...

365
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:40,612
it goes straight to hell.

366
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:45,325
You could too.

367
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:48,996
205 yards.

368
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,164
I'm fed up with you...

369
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,499
but....

370
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,251
I'll cut you a break.

371
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:59,881
One week to get out of town.

372
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:02,049
After that...

373
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:06,764
I'll use your empty little skull
to break in my new nine iron.

374
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:48,640
Are you okay?

375
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:51,267
Your car, sir.

376
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:56,772
I am now.

377
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:17,000
Tina, come on.

378
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:19,712
You can't.

379
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:22,215
You can't.

380
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,262
Go on.

381
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:31,390
I don't believe it.

382
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,037
Stupid.

383
00:33:54,873 --> 00:33:56,749
She would never...

384
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,695
No way!

385
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:55,142
Hold on, Sugar.

386
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,437
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

387
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:17,705
Somebody,stop me.

388
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,422
Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green.

389
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,675
I better make a little stop.

390
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:37,978
EDGE CITY POWER
"SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR"

391
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,688
How's it going, Freeze?

392
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,272
It's looking good here.

393
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:45,609
You're on your own. I must
go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.

394
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:46,735
Do it.

395
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:50,322
The doctor is about to operate.

396
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,307
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.

397
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,819
Cops!

398
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:42,292
Not on the list, not in the club.

399
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:00,477
How do?

400
00:37:06,484 --> 00:37:07,777
You on the list?

401
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,031
No, but I believe my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?

402
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:14,783
Franklin, Grant...

403
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:16,118
and Jackson.

404
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,002
That's it! No one gets in.

405
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:33,428
Now we present the most beautiful
flower of the Congo Bongo...

406
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:35,638
Miss Tina Carlyle.

407
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:51,696
Beautiful.

408
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:56,408
Love makes me treat you...

409
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:59,911
The way that I do
Gee, baby...

410
00:37:59,953 --> 00:38:03,291
ain't I good to you

411
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:06,419
There's nothing too good...

412
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:09,046
for a boy that's so true

413
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,259
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

414
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:16,846
I bought you a fur coat
for Christmas

415
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,475
A diamond ring...

416
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:21,351
a Cadillac car...

417
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:24,521
And everything

418
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:27,356
Love makes me treat you...

419
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,816
the way that I do

420
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:32,778
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

421
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,950
Love makes me treat you...

422
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:40,286
the way that I do

423
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:43,372
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

424
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:48,002
There's nothing too good...

425
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:50,964
for a man so true

426
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:53,717
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

427
00:38:55,302 --> 00:39:00,515
I know how to make a man happy
I'll treat you right

428
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:05,687
- Why are you here?
- There's trouble.

429
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:07,314
You better come upstairs.

430
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:10,149
Come on, let's go.

431
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:18,659
They got me paying taxes...

432
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:20,536
for what I gave to you

433
00:39:20,577 --> 00:39:24,540
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

434
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:47,813
Let's rock this joint.

435
00:41:00,553 --> 00:41:01,971
Smoking.

436
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:06,435
What happened?

437
00:41:09,646 --> 00:41:11,855
Someone hit the joint before us.

438
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,817
Get that, Doc.

439
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:18,320
Suck on that.

440
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:26,329
Son of a bitch!

441
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:31,084
Who did this, man?

442
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,877
Who?!

443
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:35,089
Him!

444
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:37,758
That's the guy.

445
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:40,136
The guy dancing with Tina?

446
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:42,012
He's dead meat.

447
00:41:42,054 --> 00:41:43,222
Come on.

448
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,724
I want this place cleared now.

449
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:47,870
Club's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

450
00:42:47,953 --> 00:42:49,998
Party's over, let's go!

451
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:52,041
Get out of here.

452
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:54,585
Get lost!

453
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:57,797
Okay, Twinkle Toes.

454
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,299
Where is my money, tell me now.

455
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:09,934
You've got 17.5 %  in T-bills
amortized over the fiscal year.

456
00:43:09,975 --> 00:43:11,227
8 %  in stocks and bonds.

457
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,854
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

458
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:17,483
Fortunately, funeral bouquets
are deductible.

459
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,028
Ice this deadbeat.

460
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:27,409
Shoot him!

461
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:33,749
Thanks.

462
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:44,010
You got me, partner.

463
00:43:56,022 --> 00:43:58,858
Hold me close,Red.

464
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:00,818
It's getting dark.

465
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:08,702
Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.

466
00:44:12,914 --> 00:44:15,959
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home
this Christmas.

467
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:22,800
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.

468
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:28,264
Pardon me.

469
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,565
Thank you.

470
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:41,610
You love me.

471
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:44,696
You really love me.

472
00:44:50,453 --> 00:44:52,747
You're not going anywhere.

473
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,755
Drop it, Tyrel!

474
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,178
Drop it.

475
00:45:09,846 --> 00:45:13,350
You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?

476
00:45:14,643 --> 00:45:17,354
What I got is probable cause.

477
00:45:17,437 --> 00:45:19,774
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.

478
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:21,692
Easy. You're giving me a woody.

479
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:24,403
And one was wearing a big,
green mask.

480
00:45:24,445 --> 00:45:27,073
For once, you're right.

481
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:29,575
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

482
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:33,246
Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

483
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:34,706
Cuff him.

484
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,334
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist.

485
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:41,254
Call that high-priced
lawyer of yours.

486
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:43,631
We'll go downtown for a chat.

487
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:45,591
Get him out of here.

488
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,782
I know you're in there.

489
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:13,161
Police!

490
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:16,497
Open up!

491
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:19,292
Oh, my God.

492
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:25,466
I know you're in there!

493
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:33,222
Open up!

494
00:46:33,306 --> 00:46:37,227
Come on, I'm getting blisters
on my fingers.

495
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,482
Stop it.

496
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:44,859
I'm coming, okay.

497
00:46:44,901 --> 00:46:47,445
I'll be right there.

498
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:53,827
Let's go, move it!

499
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:55,829
Alright!

500
00:47:01,543 --> 00:47:03,170
Hi, Lieutenant.

501
00:47:03,212 --> 00:47:06,925
This isn't the best time right now.
I just--

502
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:08,927
Won't you come in?

503
00:47:11,804 --> 00:47:13,222
Where were you last night?

504
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:15,890
Here, mostly.

505
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:16,891
Something wrong?

506
00:47:16,974 --> 00:47:18,976
What do you know about The Mask?

507
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,146
"Mask?"

508
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,898
Don't insult my intelligence.

509
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:26,777
He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

510
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,488
There can't be 2 idiots
with these pajamas.

511
00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:34,076
May I see those pajamas?

512
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:37,956
Those pajamas?

513
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:40,917
Those pajamas...

514
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,378
were stolen.

515
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:46,089
Somebody stole your pajamas?

516
00:47:51,385 --> 00:47:55,681
What is this city coming to...

517
00:47:55,764 --> 00:48:00,978
when a man's pajama drawer is
no longer safe!

518
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:07,777
Look at that guy.

519
00:48:07,861 --> 00:48:11,030
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'll say.

520
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:16,286
That's one hell of a rubber mask.

521
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:17,662
Lab reports?

522
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:22,292
We got fingerprints from currency,
but nothing matches Tyrel's men.

523
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,918
He beat them to the punch.

524
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,798
Get the bank employee files and run
down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.

525
00:48:28,882 --> 00:48:31,383
You figure it was an inside job?

526
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:35,054
I need some prints to lock
this whack job up till doomsday.

527
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,559
50 grand...

528
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:44,230
to whoever finds that green bastard
before the cops.

529
00:48:44,314 --> 00:48:47,650
I want you to get the word out
to every street hustler...

530
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:50,488
every low life in this town.
Understand?

531
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:53,699
I want him here tomorrow, alive.

532
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,951
You still here?

533
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:58,953
Come on, let's go.

534
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:05,753
What are you looking at?

535
00:49:05,836 --> 00:49:06,921
You.

536
00:49:06,962 --> 00:49:08,589
You're losing it.

537
00:49:08,672 --> 00:49:12,425
I'm not losing anything...

538
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:14,344
except maybe some extra baggage.

539
00:49:14,427 --> 00:49:16,012
What's that mean?

540
00:49:18,348 --> 00:49:21,685
You didn't fight much last night
when that freak kissed you.

541
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:25,022
Did it look like I had much
of a choice?

542
00:49:26,232 --> 00:49:27,816
Maybe you did...

543
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:32,821
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

544
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:35,825
I'll tell you one thing.

545
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:40,287
It's going to be payback for anybody
who crosses me.

546
00:49:50,923 --> 00:49:54,510
We have a crisis here and you
stroll in an hour late?

547
00:49:54,593 --> 00:49:56,554
If I must put up with--

548
00:49:56,637 --> 00:49:59,431
Back off, monkey boy...

549
00:49:59,515 --> 00:50:03,184
or I'll tell your dad you treat
this place like your piggy bank.

550
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:05,187
Or we should call the IRS...

551
00:50:05,229 --> 00:50:08,482
and arrange a vacation for you
at Club Fed?

552
00:50:11,652 --> 00:50:13,571
That'll be all.

553
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:18,576
Genius.

554
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:22,330
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.

555
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:26,251
God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

556
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:27,752
I'm not sure.

557
00:50:28,795 --> 00:50:31,213
I haven't exactly been myself lately.

558
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:33,340
You don't look real fabulous.

559
00:50:33,382 --> 00:50:35,384
Really, do I look bad?

560
00:50:36,635 --> 00:50:40,181
Don't worry. This'll put the color
back in your cheeks.

561
00:50:40,222 --> 00:50:44,560
2 tickets to the charity ball
at the Coco Bongo Club, Saturday.

562
00:50:44,602 --> 00:50:47,104
Anybody who's anybody will be there.

563
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:49,064
Want to be my date?

564
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,033
Wait just a minute.

565
00:50:58,116 --> 00:51:01,453
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to thank you.

566
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:05,500
I don't have much to open an account
with anymore.

567
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,919
What about the club?
You were doing great.

568
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,837
It's not your problem.
I'll be okay.

569
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:13,631
Come here.

570
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:21,807
You didn't stop by just to see me,
did you?

571
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,727
It's okay, tell me.

572
00:51:28,396 --> 00:51:31,066
The guy they say robbed this place...

573
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:33,985
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the club.

574
00:51:34,986 --> 00:51:36,322
Really?

575
00:51:36,405 --> 00:51:38,991
They say he's pretty...

576
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:40,200
weird looking.

577
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:44,913
Yeah, but...

578
00:51:44,996 --> 00:51:47,374
you should see him dance.

579
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:52,587
Did anyone find out who he is?

580
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:54,798
Why, you interested?

581
00:51:56,675 --> 00:51:58,802
Just curious, I guess.

582
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:04,391
I better be going.

583
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:06,436
Thanks for everything.

584
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:09,689
You'd like to see him again?

585
00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:17,362
I wouldn't mind.

586
00:52:17,446 --> 00:52:20,073
I know him, you know.

587
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:21,784
You do?

588
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:24,996
We're old college buddies,
him and me.

589
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:29,750
It's funny you mention
he dances because...

590
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,924
I taught him a couple of
dance moves myself.

591
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:40,136
Think you could have him
meet me tonight?

592
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:42,305
Maybe I could work something out.

593
00:52:42,388 --> 00:52:45,308
- How about at Landfill Park?
- Sunset.

594
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:47,267
- Perfect.
- Super.

595
00:52:48,602 --> 00:52:52,106
Thanks, Stanley.
You really are a nice guy.

596
00:52:58,988 --> 00:53:01,199
This is an interesting place.

597
00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:04,452
Looks like fourth-
or fifth-century Scandinavian.

598
00:53:04,535 --> 00:53:08,916
Possibly a representation of one
of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.

599
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:13,586
Loki?

600
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:15,087
Who is Loki?

601
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:17,632
The Norse god of mischief.

602
00:53:17,715 --> 00:53:22,678
Supposedly he caused such trouble that
Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.

603
00:53:24,722 --> 00:53:27,433
Then he could have banished him
into that mask.

604
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:30,561
I'm talking about mythology,
Mr. Ipkiss.

605
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:32,563
This is a piece of wood.

606
00:53:33,564 --> 00:53:35,108
but your book...!

607
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:38,695
My book is about
masks as a metaphor.

608
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:41,865
A metaphor,not to be taken literally.

609
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:43,867
You suffer from a mild delusion.

610
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:48,455
Alright.

611
00:53:51,917 --> 00:53:53,584
I'll prove it to you.

612
00:53:54,794 --> 00:53:58,339
But I am not responsible
for the consequences.

613
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:02,301
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert.

614
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:05,429
You don't scare me.
Go right ahead.

615
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:08,725
See you.

616
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:38,255
You said Loki was a night god.
Maybe it works at night.

617
00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:43,802
I should warn you that I don't work
personally with really sick people.

618
00:54:43,886 --> 00:54:47,306
There are private institutions
for those things.

619
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:51,352
I can arrange for a safe environment
for you tonight, if you want.

620
00:54:55,482 --> 00:54:57,275
I must see Tina.

621
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:00,152
But what can I do?

622
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:03,113
Do I go as myself...

623
00:55:03,155 --> 00:55:04,782
or The Mask?

624
00:55:06,242 --> 00:55:10,371
If I tell you, you promise
to leave my office right now?

625
00:55:17,002 --> 00:55:18,879
Go as yourself...

626
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:21,216
and as The Mask.

627
00:55:21,257 --> 00:55:25,637
Because they are both
one and the same beautiful person.

628
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:30,600
Got the cross-check on
the fingerprints. It's Ipkiss.

629
00:55:30,683 --> 00:55:31,975
I'm looking at him.

630
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:34,520
Keep the SWAT team standing by.

631
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:38,274
If he's half as bad as they say,
we'll have a full dance card.

632
00:55:38,358 --> 00:55:40,110
Pickle relish?

633
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:43,113
- Get in the car.
- But I ordered onion rings.

634
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:49,577
LANDFILL PARK

635
00:56:11,057 --> 00:56:12,725
What are you doing here?

636
00:56:15,562 --> 00:56:19,482
I wanted to make sure that you
2 got together all right.

637
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:21,360
That's nice.

638
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:24,780
I hardly ever stop by here.

639
00:56:24,864 --> 00:56:26,991
It's hard to believe it was...

640
00:56:27,074 --> 00:56:28,242
a garbage heap.

641
00:56:30,578 --> 00:56:35,540
It's really beautiful
right around sunset.

642
00:56:35,623 --> 00:56:39,586
The methane emissions
really pick up the colors.

643
00:56:39,669 --> 00:56:41,087
All those...

644
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:43,756
pinks and greens.

645
00:56:50,013 --> 00:56:53,267
My friend will be along here
any minute. I better go.

646
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:56,937
Stanley, wait.

647
00:57:03,194 --> 00:57:04,904
Hello, cherie.

648
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:07,032
We meet again!

649
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:08,408
Is it fate?

650
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:11,451
Is it meant to be?
It is written in the stars...

651
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:13,995
that we are destined to fraternize?

652
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:16,915
I'd like to think so.

653
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:25,716
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal
my croissant.

654
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,596
I will spread your p t . I will dip
my ladle in your vichyssoise.

655
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:37,145
She's so coy.

656
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,189
I love it.

657
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:48,739
Our love is like a red, red rose.

658
00:57:48,823 --> 00:57:51,367
And I am a little thorny.

659
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,994
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!

660
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:56,163
Shoot the window. I don't care!

661
00:57:58,124 --> 00:58:00,835
This is Kellaway.
I need back-up.

662
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,712
Cigarette?

663
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:18,102
Now, like Napoleon...

664
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:21,648
I will divide and conquer.

665
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:24,734
Police!

666
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,028
Merde.

667
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,489
Freeze.

668
00:58:32,783 --> 00:58:34,160
Put your hands up.

669
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:36,496
But you told me to freeze.

670
00:58:36,538 --> 00:58:39,749
Alright, alright, unfreeze.

671
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,878
You're under arrest.

672
00:58:42,961 --> 00:58:45,714
It wasn't me.

673
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,258
It was the one-armed man.

674
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:50,926
Alright, I confess.

675
00:58:50,968 --> 00:58:54,347
I did it, you hear?
And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!

676
00:58:55,765 --> 00:59:00,061
What are they going to do to me, Sarge?
What are they going to do?

677
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:03,440
Sorry, son, that's not my department.

678
00:59:03,523 --> 00:59:04,733
Search him.

679
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:10,406
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

680
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:18,872
It's going to be a long night.
My wife'll kill me.

681
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:22,584
- What is it?
- Cops got Ipkiss at Landfill Park.

682
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:26,296
Let me cover it. I need this story.
You go home to Claire.

683
00:59:26,379 --> 00:59:28,548
I don't know. Ramsey said--

684
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:30,884
I will take care of Ramsey.

685
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,677
Thanks a million, I owe you one.

686
00:59:33,845 --> 00:59:36,306
Really big sunglasses, nerf ball...

687
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:38,810
Bike horn...

688
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:41,729
Small-mouthed bass...
bowling pin...

689
00:59:44,357 --> 00:59:45,399
mouse-trap...

690
00:59:45,483 --> 00:59:47,110
rubber chicken...

691
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:50,279
- Little to the left. That's it.
- I don't know.

692
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:52,323
Funny eyeball glasses...

693
00:59:52,406 --> 00:59:54,700
I've never seen those in my life.

694
00:59:54,784 --> 00:59:56,952
- bazooka.
- I have a permit for that.

695
00:59:58,036 --> 00:59:59,955
- Picture of Kellaway's wife...
- What?

696
01:00:00,705 --> 01:00:02,165
CALL ME LOVER!

697
01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:04,292
Margaret! Son of a bitch!

698
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:08,673
I figured you had a sense of humor.

699
01:00:08,756 --> 01:00:09,966
you married her!

700
01:00:12,468 --> 01:00:15,096
That's got to hurt.

701
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:16,472
Get him!

702
01:00:39,996 --> 01:00:42,540
It's over. Raise your hands...

703
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,667
or we'll fire.

704
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:49,338
Hit it!

705
01:01:10,235 --> 01:01:14,238
They call me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rumba beat

706
01:01:14,322 --> 01:01:15,865
When I play the maracas

707
01:01:15,948 --> 01:01:17,700
I go chick-chicky boom

708
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:20,411
Yes, I'm Cuban Pete

709
01:01:20,495 --> 01:01:22,748
I'm the craze of my street

710
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:26,960
When I start to dance everything goes
Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom

711
01:01:27,044 --> 01:01:29,171
The senoritas sing...

712
01:01:29,254 --> 01:01:31,507
and they swing

713
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,509
It's very nice

714
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:34,675
Full of spice

715
01:01:35,718 --> 01:01:39,932
They dance and bring a happy ring
Never a care

716
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:43,936
Singing a song
All the day long

717
01:01:46,605 --> 01:01:50,359
If you like the beat
Take a lesson from Cuban Pete

718
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,694
I'll teach you to
chick-chicky boom

719
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,782
He's a modest guy

720
01:01:56,865 --> 01:01:59,159
Although he's the hottest guy

721
01:01:59,243 --> 01:02:03,122
In Havana

722
01:02:03,205 --> 01:02:05,249
Si, senorita, I know...

723
01:02:05,332 --> 01:02:07,918
that when I chicky boom

724
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,255
It's very nice
so full of spice

725
01:02:11,296 --> 01:02:13,465
I place my hand on your hip

726
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:16,260
And if you will give me your hand

727
01:02:16,301 --> 01:02:20,264
Then we shall try
Just you and I

728
01:02:21,557 --> 01:02:24,269
- Not bad.
- Shut up and help me down.

729
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:27,981
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom
Chick-chicky boom

730
01:02:49,668 --> 01:02:52,004
Dance and I'll blow your brains out.

731
01:02:56,426 --> 01:02:57,760
Give me that thing.

732
01:02:59,304 --> 01:03:00,430
See you!

733
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:04,684
There! Let's get him.
Snap out of it. This dance is over!

734
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:07,188
Let's go! Follow me, officers!

735
01:03:13,026 --> 01:03:17,154
He's down the alley. Follow me.
Come on. Grab your gun.

736
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:39,804
Stanley, get in!

737
01:03:41,138 --> 01:03:42,181
There!

738
01:03:44,308 --> 01:03:46,477
Halt, or I'll shoot!

739
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:49,646
Shoot! Shoot!

740
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:53,316
Seat belts.

741
01:03:57,529 --> 01:03:58,696
I missed him.

742
01:03:59,864 --> 01:04:02,534
Come on, we all missed him.

743
01:04:05,578 --> 01:04:08,541
THE MASK ROBS BANK

744
01:04:08,582 --> 01:04:10,376
I saw it.

745
01:04:11,252 --> 01:04:13,045
I saw everything.

746
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:16,382
What's happening to you, Stanley?

747
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:20,718
It's crazy.

748
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,893
I'm losing control.

749
01:04:27,977 --> 01:04:30,062
When I put that mask on...

750
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:32,231
I can do anything.

751
01:04:32,272 --> 01:04:35,191
Be anything.

752
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:40,531
It's wrecking my life.

753
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:44,618
My life is wrecked. Wrecked.

754
01:04:46,162 --> 01:04:49,206
I don't know what's happening to you...

755
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:52,961
but I do know this:

756
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:57,465
that letter you sent my column...

757
01:04:57,548 --> 01:05:00,509
that was from a guy with more guts...

758
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,387
and more heart...

759
01:05:03,471 --> 01:05:06,807
than any of the creeps
I've met in this city.

760
01:05:06,891 --> 01:05:09,936
Whatever that mask is...

761
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,396
you don't need it.

762
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,689
You...

763
01:05:14,523 --> 01:05:16,901
Stanley Ipkiss...

764
01:05:16,942 --> 01:05:20,237
are already all you'll ever need to be.

765
01:05:24,493 --> 01:05:26,619
Gosh, Peg...

766
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:30,122
do you really mean that?

767
01:05:31,582 --> 01:05:33,793
Actually...

768
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:34,960
no.

769
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:36,629
What?

770
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:41,635
Where were you? I've been vamping
for 20 minutes.

771
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:43,637
Is this him?

772
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:45,680
You got the 50 thou'?

773
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,725
Give her the money.

774
01:05:51,937 --> 01:05:53,271
Right.

775
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:56,024
With the mask on, he turns
into that green thing.

776
01:05:59,109 --> 01:06:00,945
What are you doing?

777
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:06,200
Sorry. You really are a great guy,
I just can't lose my condo.

778
01:06:06,283 --> 01:06:09,329
It's so hard to find an apartment
in this city.

779
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:15,877
You said you wouldn't hurt him!

780
01:06:19,005 --> 01:06:20,173
I lied.

781
01:06:39,568 --> 01:06:41,153
Tell me.

782
01:06:41,236 --> 01:06:42,696
How's this mask work?

783
01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:45,615
I don't know. You just...

784
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:47,868
put it on.

785
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:01,883
Boss...

786
01:07:02,758 --> 01:07:04,343
be careful, huh?

787
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,407
What a rush.

788
01:07:27,784 --> 01:07:31,621
You okay?

789
01:07:32,705 --> 01:07:34,707
I'm better than ever, you idiot.

790
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:38,961
What do we do with Ipkiss?

791
01:07:41,255 --> 01:07:43,257
The police want the mask.

792
01:07:43,299 --> 01:07:46,302
We'll give them The Mask.

793
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:58,815
The money better be here...

794
01:07:58,898 --> 01:08:01,484
or you can lp-kiss your ass good-bye.

795
01:08:48,823 --> 01:08:49,949
Get over there.

796
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,965
Can't believe it. Hardened cops
dancing in the street...

797
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,509
and broadcast on the 11 o'clock news.

798
01:09:07,593 --> 01:09:10,388
- The SWAT team was offered Vegas.
- I'm history.

799
01:09:10,472 --> 01:09:14,475
The Captain'll have my badge
for breakfast with a pension on top.

800
01:09:14,558 --> 01:09:18,144
It's not all your fault.
Something will turn up.

801
01:09:18,227 --> 01:09:21,898
Sure, Ipkiss will fall
right into my lap.

802
01:09:28,655 --> 01:09:30,574
Get him off of me!

803
01:09:35,621 --> 01:09:36,872
Wait!

804
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:38,708
I can explain everything.

805
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:42,587
You can explain everything?
Explain this!

806
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,175
Get him up! Let's go!
I got a cell for you, pal.

807
01:10:10,824 --> 01:10:12,283
Forget about me, buddy.

808
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:14,661
Find a new place to live.

809
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,499
I'll be in here for a long, long time.

810
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,596
You, with the face.

811
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:37,224
You got a visitor.

812
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:48,945
- Why?
- Is it true?

813
01:10:50,905 --> 01:10:52,323
You're The Mask.

814
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:55,619
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
If I get...

815
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:58,705
a good lawyer and a deal...

816
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:00,957
I'll be out in about 10,000 years.

817
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,293
It's risky, coming here.

818
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:05,879
Your boyfriend might be upset.

819
01:11:07,505 --> 01:11:11,635
He'll be at the charity ball tonight.

820
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:13,970
Like what? The Lambada?

821
01:11:14,053 --> 01:11:18,224
This is serious. There must be a way
to stop him.

822
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:20,435
How does it work?

823
01:11:21,227 --> 01:11:22,645
I don't know.

824
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:26,025
It's like...

825
01:11:26,108 --> 01:11:29,487
it brings your innermost desires
to life.

826
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:31,863
If deep down inside...

827
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:36,326
you're a bit repressed and
hopelessly romantic...

828
01:11:36,367 --> 01:11:38,496
you become some sort of...

829
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:41,248
a love-crazy wild man.

830
01:11:41,332 --> 01:11:43,334
And if you're like Dorian?

831
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:46,212
Then we're all in big trouble.

832
01:11:46,295 --> 01:11:49,256
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast.

833
01:11:52,176 --> 01:11:53,427
Thanks.

834
01:11:54,386 --> 01:11:55,513
For what?

835
01:11:55,554 --> 01:11:57,848
Lots of things.

836
01:12:01,519 --> 01:12:04,062
Sharing a sunset with me.

837
01:12:04,145 --> 01:12:09,360
For being the only guy who treated me
like a person, not...

838
01:12:09,443 --> 01:12:10,569
a party favor.

839
01:12:13,948 --> 01:12:16,700
For being any kind of romantic...

840
01:12:16,784 --> 01:12:18,619
even a hopeless one.

841
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:26,169
You're welcome.

842
01:12:26,253 --> 01:12:28,880
That night at the club I knew...

843
01:12:28,964 --> 01:12:31,925
I'd found someone special.

844
01:12:34,552 --> 01:12:37,262
The Mask.

845
01:12:37,345 --> 01:12:40,266
It was the guy inside The Mask.

846
01:12:40,349 --> 01:12:43,936
It was you all along.

847
01:12:49,316 --> 01:12:51,986
Lady, time's up.

848
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:53,989
Could I have just...

849
01:12:54,072 --> 01:12:55,949
one more minute?

850
01:12:57,909 --> 01:13:00,287
I've got to disappear for a while now.

851
01:13:00,328 --> 01:13:03,999
Don't know where but I'll let you know
as soon as I can.

852
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,670
Somebody help me!

853
01:13:55,509 --> 01:13:57,177
Guard, guard!

854
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,514
A woman's being chased in the alley.

855
01:14:00,597 --> 01:14:02,516
She needs help.

856
01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:05,310
Sure. Keep it down.

857
01:14:05,393 --> 01:14:08,146
Serve and protect, man!

858
01:14:28,584 --> 01:14:31,003
Good boy. Come on.

859
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:35,298
Jump up. Can you jump up?

860
01:14:37,008 --> 01:14:39,971
Remember how I taught you not to
jump up on people? Forget that.

861
01:14:40,054 --> 01:14:42,056
Come on! Get up here.

862
01:14:44,308 --> 01:14:46,185
Get up. Get up here!

863
01:14:47,061 --> 01:14:49,646
Get up. Get up here. That's it.

864
01:14:49,688 --> 01:14:52,190
You can do it.
Come on. Come on!

865
01:14:55,862 --> 01:14:57,363
Put some effort into it!

866
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,883
Baby, there you are.

867
01:15:16,924 --> 01:15:18,801
I was worried about you.

868
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:22,929
- You talk to the cops?
- Only to see what Ipkiss told them.

869
01:15:23,013 --> 01:15:27,059
That's right, you and Stanley.
You two are getting awfully close.

870
01:15:28,186 --> 01:15:30,229
Bet you helped him with the bank job.

871
01:15:30,313 --> 01:15:33,107
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

872
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:36,944
Look what I found in her car.

873
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:40,073
Going away alone, baby?

874
01:15:44,286 --> 01:15:46,413
Boys, I want you to...

875
01:15:46,497 --> 01:15:48,957
get her something pretty to wear.

876
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:54,086
We're going to a party tonight.

877
01:15:54,128 --> 01:15:56,881
We'll have one hell of a time, right?

878
01:15:58,424 --> 01:15:59,926
Get out of my sight.

879
01:16:01,135 --> 01:16:02,553
Jump up.

880
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:03,846
Get up. Come on.

881
01:16:05,765 --> 01:16:08,601
Come on, Milo. Jump, please.

882
01:16:08,643 --> 01:16:10,813
Do it for Daddy.

883
01:16:14,566 --> 01:16:16,401
That's it!

884
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:20,447
God, I can't believe it.

885
01:16:21,907 --> 01:16:24,619
Good boy. Good boy.

886
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:29,623
See that man over there?

887
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,291
He's got keys.

888
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:34,877
Go get those keys.

889
01:16:34,961 --> 01:16:37,588
Go get them. Go get the keys.

890
01:16:40,008 --> 01:16:40,968
That's it.

891
01:16:42,344 --> 01:16:43,387
The key.

892
01:16:49,309 --> 01:16:51,520
No, not the cheese, the keys.

893
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:55,733
Drop the cheese...

894
01:16:57,152 --> 01:16:58,611
and get the keys.

895
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:01,280
Over there, over there.

896
01:17:19,423 --> 01:17:21,842
Oh, man. Come on.

897
01:17:21,884 --> 01:17:24,304
Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy.

898
01:17:25,472 --> 01:17:28,141
Give it, give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

899
01:17:28,224 --> 01:17:30,894
Come on, drop it, drop it.

900
01:17:30,977 --> 01:17:33,104
It's sundown.

901
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:35,022
It's almost time.

902
01:17:37,274 --> 01:17:39,193
I wouldn't, darling.

903
01:17:40,445 --> 01:17:41,696
DANGER
EXPLOSIVES

904
01:17:41,738 --> 01:17:44,699
Wouldn't want to start the
celebration early.

905
01:18:29,495 --> 01:18:30,579
Hold it!

906
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:32,414
I am warning you...

907
01:18:32,498 --> 01:18:34,749
I am seriously stressed out here.

908
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:36,000
Easy.

909
01:18:36,084 --> 01:18:38,002
Come on.

910
01:18:38,086 --> 01:18:39,419
Don't be an idiot.

911
01:18:39,462 --> 01:18:44,092
You're in a police station. There is no
way you'll walk out of here like this.

912
01:18:45,593 --> 01:18:47,262
You're know, you're right.

913
01:18:49,931 --> 01:18:52,767
- Absolutely right.
- What are you doing?

914
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,688
You'll take me out...

915
01:18:55,771 --> 01:18:57,523
as your prisoner.

916
01:18:57,606 --> 01:19:00,317
Put it on! Put it on!

917
01:19:01,902 --> 01:19:03,154
Come on.

918
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:05,948
- I'm really very sorry about this.
- I'm sure.

919
01:19:08,993 --> 01:19:10,787
You got the wrong guy.

920
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,289
It's a bum rap.

921
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,039
I got my rights.

922
01:19:14,123 --> 01:19:16,082
Where are you taking Ipkiss?

923
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:19,210
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay.

924
01:19:19,294 --> 01:19:22,755
I get it. Pig Latin, right?

925
01:19:22,839 --> 01:19:24,800
Eesay ouyay aterlay.

926
01:19:26,135 --> 01:19:27,344
Come on!

927
01:19:35,019 --> 01:19:37,605
Sit back and relax.

928
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:42,486
I must change for the party.

929
01:19:52,578 --> 01:19:54,997
TONIGHT, CASINO

930
01:19:58,042 --> 01:20:00,669
WAR ORPHANS FUND

931
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:15,477
I need cigarettes.

932
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,854
- Which brand?
- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke.

933
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,731
But for you, I would shoot
the Surgeon General.

934
01:20:22,107 --> 01:20:24,109
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word?

935
01:20:24,193 --> 01:20:28,573
I always have time for the press
and my loyal constituents.

936
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,362
Let me out of these cuffs,
you drive like a maniac.

937
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,823
Sorry, we're late for the ball.

938
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:12,535
Alice and the rabbit'll be
disappointed.

939
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,245
Now you're being cynical.

940
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,290
Who are you?

941
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,376
I'm just an ex-employee...

942
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,045
who's come for his back pay.

943
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,506
Or should I say payback?

944
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,678
Kill him.

945
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,158
Come on.

946
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,640
Ladies and gentlemen...

947
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,767
I will be the host...

948
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,894
for the rest of the evening.

949
01:22:30,614 --> 01:22:32,990
Get your dog away from me.

950
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:36,409
Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.

951
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:39,579
Where's everyone?
Something's not kosher.

952
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:40,873
- Exactly.
- Watch it!

953
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,166
Sorry.

954
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,709
I must lock you in.

955
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,421
Use the radio.

956
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:50,842
You know, call for back-up
or something.

957
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:56,723
This could be dangerous.
Stay here and be a good boy.

958
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:00,602
Daddy has to go kick some ass.

959
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,774
He's a dead man.

960
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:09,694
Down! Get down!

961
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:13,532
Take it easy, I got the point.

962
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:26,086
Blow it!

963
01:23:34,178 --> 01:23:36,180
Bastard.

964
01:23:36,263 --> 01:23:37,930
What's the matter, darling?

965
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:40,099
This is your big production number.

966
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:42,561
And you know it's important...

967
01:23:42,603 --> 01:23:44,980
to go out with a big bang.

968
01:23:54,281 --> 01:23:55,782
Why are you here?

969
01:23:55,824 --> 01:23:59,328
Take this gun and start
sneaking people out the back.

970
01:24:03,373 --> 01:24:04,666
Step back.

971
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:08,128
- Do you know who I am?
- A dead man if you don't step back.

972
01:24:08,212 --> 01:24:10,129
What about some respect?

973
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:13,008
- What kind of thug are you?
- All set, Dorian.

974
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,762
That's it.

975
01:24:18,096 --> 01:24:20,098
This party's over...

976
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:22,100
in 10 minutes.

977
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:26,147
This is the moment when a man...

978
01:24:26,231 --> 01:24:28,483
shows what he's really made of.

979
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:30,819
Crap.

980
01:24:30,902 --> 01:24:32,695
Drop it.

981
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,792
Smart dog.

982
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:56,678
Boss, look who decided to crash
the party.

983
01:24:56,761 --> 01:24:59,055
How's it going?

984
01:24:59,139 --> 01:25:00,974
Bring him up here!

985
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,394
Wait! No!

986
01:25:04,477 --> 01:25:08,064
This is no time for last requests.

987
01:25:08,148 --> 01:25:10,651
But all I wanted was a kiss.

988
01:25:10,734 --> 01:25:13,070
A kiss?

989
01:25:13,154 --> 01:25:15,114
Just one...

990
01:25:15,197 --> 01:25:17,197
Iast kiss.

991
01:25:17,281 --> 01:25:19,158
I can't shut it off.

992
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:22,953
There's always time...

993
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:26,916
for one last kiss.

994
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,090
From the real Dorian.

995
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,719
The one I used to love.

996
01:25:39,095 --> 01:25:41,182
Nobody ever kissed me
like Dorian Tyrel.

997
01:25:42,308 --> 01:25:43,225
Romeo!

998
01:25:43,309 --> 01:25:45,394
This place will blow!

999
01:25:45,478 --> 01:25:47,730
Just wait!

1000
01:25:52,233 --> 01:25:54,194
I've decided...

1001
01:26:02,577 --> 01:26:04,913
to give her one last thrill.

1002
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:17,259
Get it!

1003
01:26:34,318 --> 01:26:35,860
Run, Milo!

1004
01:26:39,405 --> 01:26:41,992
Stanley, hurry!

1005
01:26:42,076 --> 01:26:43,661
Don't worry.

1006
01:26:43,744 --> 01:26:45,538
It's all over now.

1007
01:26:56,465 --> 01:26:57,466
Got you.

1008
01:27:10,104 --> 01:27:11,690
I'll take you apart.

1009
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:16,026
I hope you can enjoy the victory
with one freaking eye!

1010
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:35,588
Good doggie.

1011
01:27:35,671 --> 01:27:36,630
Good doggie.

1012
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:57,360
I'm winning!

1013
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:22,552
JACKPOT

1014
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:37,858
Oh, my God!

1015
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:40,110
This must be a new breed.

1016
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:41,696
Easy, boy!

1017
01:28:45,575 --> 01:28:46,618
Good boy!

1018
01:29:17,524 --> 01:29:19,317
Did you miss me?

1019
01:29:27,076 --> 01:29:28,161
I guess not!

1020
01:29:35,293 --> 01:29:38,629
Now, you have to ask yourself
one question:

1021
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:41,257
"Do I feel lucky?"

1022
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,300
Well...

1023
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:46,679
do you...

1024
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:48,389
punks?

1025
01:30:22,673 --> 01:30:25,968
That's a spicy meatball.

1026
01:30:33,852 --> 01:30:35,312
How do?

1027
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:44,279
This guy's incorrigible.

1028
01:31:12,183 --> 01:31:14,394
You were good, kid, real good...

1029
01:31:14,477 --> 01:31:18,063
but as long as I'm around
you'll be second-best.

1030
01:31:38,876 --> 01:31:40,961
Police! Hands up!

1031
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:44,799
Officers, arrest those men.

1032
01:31:44,883 --> 01:31:47,469
I've always wanted to say that.

1033
01:31:50,513 --> 01:31:51,639
Come on.

1034
01:31:53,015 --> 01:31:54,391
Give me that gun.

1035
01:32:00,189 --> 01:32:03,317
He stole all our jewelry.
Take me to headquarters...

1036
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,360
Stop that man!

1037
01:32:08,363 --> 01:32:09,740
I've got you now.

1038
01:32:09,781 --> 01:32:11,910
Watch it, Chunky!

1039
01:32:11,951 --> 01:32:14,913
- Mayor Tilton, I'm so--
- What's wrong with you?

1040
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:16,748
That man is The Mask.

1041
01:32:16,789 --> 01:32:20,877
No. Dorian Tyrel was The Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1042
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,087
This man here saved our lives.

1043
01:32:23,129 --> 01:32:26,215
- With a little help.
- You're a real hero.

1044
01:32:27,091 --> 01:32:28,802
It's nothing...

1045
01:32:28,885 --> 01:32:30,929
any American with...

1046
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:34,265
balls of steel wouldn't do
for his community.

1047
01:32:34,307 --> 01:32:36,434
Come on.

1048
01:32:38,769 --> 01:32:40,896
Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?

1049
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:43,858
Leave the dog alone.

1050
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:46,611
I want you in my office
first thing tomorrow.

1051
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:49,823
- Yes, Your Honor.
- That doesn't sound good at all.

1052
01:32:49,906 --> 01:32:53,451
No, it doesn't.
What would sound good to you?

1053
01:32:53,535 --> 01:32:55,787
- Breakfast.
- Shut up!

1054
01:33:15,307 --> 01:33:17,267
Sure you know what you're doing?

1055
01:33:19,686 --> 01:33:21,604
I'm sure.

1056
01:33:21,688 --> 01:33:23,648
Then do what you must.

1057
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:39,080
Sure you won't miss this guy?

1058
01:33:39,164 --> 01:33:42,501
When he's gone, all that's left is me.

1059
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:29,007
Smoking!

1060
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:00,444
THE MASK
