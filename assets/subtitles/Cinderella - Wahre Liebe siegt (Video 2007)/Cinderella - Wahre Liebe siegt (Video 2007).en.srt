1
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,664
<i>Do you remember the story</i>
<i>of a girl who lived a life of cinders,</i>

2
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,974
<i>and how she found true love because</i>
<i>she kept a beautiful dream in her heart?</i>

3
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,709
<i>Of course it helped that she had</i>
<i>mouse friends who could sew</i>

4
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,982
<i>and a Fairy Godmother</i>
<i>who could do wonders with pumpkins.</i>

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,456
<i>Well, that girl is me.</i>

6
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:23,944
Would my perfectly perfect
wife put on her perfectly fitting shoes?

7
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,678
You found my shoes.

8
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,719
Better hurry.
Fairy Godmother's waiting.

9
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,189
What were the mice
using them for this time?

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,418
Boats.

11
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,482
There.

12
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,828
Pathetic.

13
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,566
Give me your hand.

14
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,130
Surprise!

15
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,985
So that's how Cinderella did it. Magic.

16
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,414
Perfect!

17
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,927
Mother! Mother!

18
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,087
Mother!

19
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,225
- Anastasia, where have you been?
- Slacking off again.

20
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,271
Mother, our troubles are over!

21
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,435
A stick?

22
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,305
Ooh! Let's beat her with it.

23
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,368
No, no, no, no. Not a stick.

24
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,709
A magic wand.

25
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,079
Well, she finally cracked.

26
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,141
I saw this nutty old woman and zap!

27
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:50,781
She gave Cinderella the beautiful gown
and, oh, the Prince.

28
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,691
- I blame the housework.
- Oh, I'll prove it to you.

29
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,561
Oh, what were those words again?
Wappity-pappity-poo?

30
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,429
Skip-skip-scadoo?
No, I know it. I know it. I think.

31
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,096
Oh, no I've got it. I've got it.
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

32
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,638
Oh! There it is!

33
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,765
Child, put that down!

34
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:13,107
In the wrong hands that wand
could be extremely dangerous.

35
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,342
Now, now give it back
to me you silly little goose.

36
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,613
No way, Grandma.
Bibbidi-bobbidi boo!

37
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,926
Look what you've done.

38
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,061
Now give me back my wand.

39
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,970
No, I need it,
you silly old garden gnome!

40
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,701
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

41
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,516
Oh!

42
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,052
Oh-oh.

43
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,987
Hello? Hello, hello, Grandma?

44
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,081
Oooh! Oh!

45
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,525
I... I'm sorry.
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you.

46
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:07,089
So this is how Cinderella did it.
What delicious irony.

47
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,828
Do you realize what this means, girls?

48
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,496
Yes! No more laundry!

49
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,203
It means power, riches,

50
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,212
revenge.

51
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,047
Oh.

52
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,313
I wanna be dirty, filthy, stinking rich!

53
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,378
Oh, I want a Prince of my own!

54
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,979
Oh please, please, please.

55
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,888
- Give it to me!
- No, give it to me!

56
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,688
Girls! Girls!

57
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,662
First things first.

58
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,096
Now, Cinderella,

59
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,829
to undo your trickery
and take what's rightfully ours,

60
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,566
I call upon
all the forces of the universe!

61
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,507
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

62
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:13,393
Reverse the moon and sun,
turn back tide and time,

63
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,027
unravel Cinderella's happily ever after

64
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,470
to the moment my troubles began!

65
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,001
Stop!

66
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,311
Wow.

67
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,987
The Grand Duke!

68
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,718
It worked.

69
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:17,388
Magnificent!
And no one knows except us.

70
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,658
Get ready. This is your second chance.

71
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,359
Don't waste it.

72
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,662
Where's Cinderella?

73
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,465
She's exactly
where she was the first time.

74
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,096
Cinderelly!

75
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,204
The Grand Duke!

76
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,575
Your Excellence.

77
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,840
Your Grace.

78
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,474
His Grace will now
read the royal procla...

79
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,451
Pardon me, but we're all aware
of his grace's purpose.

80
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,886
Perhaps we should just...
get on with it.

81
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,955
Quite, Madame. Quite.

82
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,596
Ooh.

83
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,712
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

84
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,511
It fits!

85
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,848
It fits?

86
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,117
It fits!

87
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,388
Mother, it fits.

88
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,689
Gee. I wonder if it fits.

89
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,196
It fits, it fits! Oh, Mother!

90
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,255
I'm gonna get my Prince!

91
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,994
Woo-hoo!

92
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,468
Grace and poise, my dear!

93
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,471
I hereby declare

94
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,947
that we have found
the Prince's bride-to-be.

95
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,614
We must return to the palace at once!

96
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,522
No. It can't be.

97
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,186
Would Your Grace excuse me?

98
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,560
I must have a word with my... maid.

99
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,555
Oof!

100
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,905
You look confused, dear.

101
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,635
How could the slipper
have fit Anastasia?

102
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,439
I danced with the Prince.
That was my slipper.

103
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,969
Here, I have the other one.
I'm the one he's looking for.

104
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,848
You may have danced with him.
You may even have thought it was love.

105
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,822
But the slipper fits Anastasia,
and that's who he's marrying.

106
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,758
Whatever you think happened
last night was a dream.

107
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:38,431
I don't care where you go
or what you do,

108
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,029
but you stay away from the palace.

109
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,167
Stay away from the Prince.

110
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,675
Oh and... clean up that broken glass.

111
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,003
Duh... what just a-happened?

112
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,377
I... I don't understand.

113
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,750
I've...

114
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,538
No, no. No cry, Gus Gus.

115
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,908
Princey knows he danced with Cinderelly.

116
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,247
Yes, of course he does.

117
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,808
Oh, if I just see him again...

118
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,911
Yeah, yeah, see Princey!

119
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,456
Yes... everything will be alright.

120
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,358
- Everything will be alright.
- Duh... yeah, yeah!

121
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,649
Cinderelly, big blue guards.

122
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:52,425
Gus Gus handle 'em.
Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!

123
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,367
Um... Let's try
the servant's entrance first.

124
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,302
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

125
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,105
- Onions for the King.
- Well done.

126
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,202
Strawberries.

127
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,543
Keep out of sight.

128
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,846
The King is waiting. There you are.

129
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,682
- The King will enjoy them.
- They're his favorite.

130
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,885
Hmm?

131
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,342
Now, all we have to do
is find him and everything will be...

132
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,884
Stop! You there.

133
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,120
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

134
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,349
I...

135
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,983
I'm in charge of all
the servants in this castle,

136
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,993
and I've never seen you before.

137
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,753
What is your purpose?

138
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:02,733
My purpose. Well... um... I...

139
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:03,859
I...

140
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,203
I'm the royal mouse catcher.

141
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,107
Royal mouse catcher? Preposterous.

142
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,337
Snap 'em and trap 'em.
That's my motto.

143
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,606
Oh, no!

144
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,839
In the 30 years
that I have supervised...

145
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,512
...this castle,

146
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,353
I can assure you there has never
ever been a single, solitary...

147
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,415
Mouse!

148
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,294
- Where is it?
- Mice!

149
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,933
Oh, please, let me help.

150
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,208
This is my kitchen.
I'll take care of it!

151
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,379
Take that! And that! Vile vermin!

152
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,879
Please, I can handle this!

153
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,438
Not now!

154
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,949
I've got them on the run!

155
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,616
Really, I can help.

156
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,124
There he is! I got him! I got him!

157
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,159
So then, I'll just go get those mice.

158
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,842
Come on, guys.

159
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,675
Nice work.

160
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,147
If we split up,
we'll find the Prince faster.

161
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,683
Split up! Righty-o!

162
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,016
- But, Dad...
- Those aren't reasons!

163
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,649
Breeding, refinement!

164
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,057
These are the reasons to marry someone.

165
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,187
Not their choice
in transparent footwear!

166
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,032
Ooh! Nice parry.

167
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,091
Thanks.

168
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,470
It's not about the slipper.
It's the girl in the slipper.

169
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,539
She was... Well, she was...

170
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,944
She was what?

171
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,280
Well, she was the one.

172
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,943
I know it.

173
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,153
You think there's only
one woman in the kingdom

174
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,285
who wears a size four and a half?

175
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,185
It's all I have to go on here.

176
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,890
Oh, poppycock!

177
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,866
You remember when you met Mom?

178
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,980
You said the first time
you touched her hand...

179
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,245
...you just knew... instantly.

180
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,256
Mmm. The stars were brighter that night.

181
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,452
Dad, you found true love.

182
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,655
That's all I want.

183
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,756
Oh! They found her!

184
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,938
Zug-zug!

185
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,515
Now, if you ladies
would please have a seat,

186
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,054
the Prince will be right with you.

187
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,722
My Prince!

188
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,597
Your Highness!

189
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,430
Oh, hello.

190
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:28,064
Am I in the right room?
Of course I'm in the right room. Um...

191
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,268
Well there... There seems to be...
a little mix-up here.

192
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,208
I assure you, Your Highness,
the slipper fits my daughter's foot.

193
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,272
See? See?

194
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,045
Huh. How could he miss it?

195
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,747
Oh, yeah, I see. Um...

196
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:47,121
It's just that I was expecting...
Well, someone else.

197
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,786
I really do feel awful about this.

198
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,057
But the royal proclamation declared...

199
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,727
Yes, but it would appear that,
uh, more than one girl

200
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,600
actually fits the... the slipper.

201
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,038
I'm very sorry
to have inconvenienced you. Um...

202
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,408
Why don't I have the Grand Duke
escort you home safely.

203
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,175
If you'll please excuse me.

204
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,739
Phew!

205
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,480
- But... but...
- Quiet!

206
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,513
You will forget who you
danced with at the ball,

207
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,081
and marry the girl
who fits the slipper...

208
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,958
...tonight. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

209
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,315
Wait. Hold the trumpet!

210
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,048
It's all coming back.

211
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,554
It is you.

212
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,655
Please. Please tell me your name.

213
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,961
It's... Anastasia.

214
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,864
Anastasia.

215
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,530
Well, I... I know it's sudden,
but will you marry me?

216
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,506
Yes! Yippee!

217
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,251
Ah!

218
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,748
Yes. Er...

219
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:33,389
I... I mean, yes. Definitely yes.

220
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,161
I will marry you.

221
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,171
Excellent. The ceremony
will take place tonight.

222
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,072
I trust that meets
with your approval, sire.

223
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,075
The sooner the better.

224
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,943
Splendid. Then tonight
we will have a new princess.

225
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,039
Wonderful. I'll go tell my father.

226
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,313
Not good! We have
to find Cinderelly, Gus Gus!

227
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,199
I feel better already.

228
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,904
Grace and poise, girls.
Just remember, grace and poise.

229
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,037
Right. Grace and poise.

230
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,344
Oh, look, a harp.

231
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,395
Lucifer?

232
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,804
Lucifer?

233
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,411
Lucifer! Come here!

234
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,759
Phew.

235
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,697
Your Highness.

236
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,064
Yes?

237
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,433
Hello.

238
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,870
Um... Hello.

239
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,306
It's wonderful to see you again.

240
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,176
Um... I'm sorry, have we met?

241
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,313
I believe we danced
last night at the ball.

242
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,784
Well, uh... maybe you've
mistaken me for some other prince.

243
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,791
I don't think so.

244
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,728
You are quite the dancer.

245
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,231
Well, it wasn't just me.

246
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,895
It was the lady I was...

247
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,835
...dancing with.

248
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,078
Oh, Your Highness.

249
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:08,142
Uh... As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna marry her.

250
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,381
Marry? Really?

251
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,082
Yes! Tonight.

252
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,419
Tonight?

253
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,926
Once you dance
with someone like Anastasia,

254
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,825
you don't want to waste any time.

255
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,864
Did you say Anastasia?

256
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,023
Yes.

257
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,895
But...

258
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,598
Well... I guess I better be going.

259
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,109
I've got to tell my father.

260
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,339
- But that's not right.
- I'm sorry?

261
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,577
You there. Royal mouse catcher!
I need you this...

262
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,087
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry,
Your Grace. I didn't realize...

263
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,247
I was the one...

264
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,416
I need her this instant!
Please excuse us, Your Highness?

265
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,483
Please. I'm sorry, just one moment.

266
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,325
No, no, no. Of course,
I can see you're busy.

267
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,592
I'll... I'll let you go.

268
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,092
But... it was me.

269
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,655
Start here! I want this castle
completely rodent-free

270
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,715
in time for the wedding.

271
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,244
Cinderelly! Cinderelly!

272
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,615
Gus?

273
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,017
Cinderelly!

274
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,645
Whoa!

275
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,189
We found Princey!

276
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:56,159
I did too. But he doesn't
even know who I am.

277
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,120
No, no, no!

278
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,660
It's a magic.

279
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,666
What? What are you talking about?

280
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,103
Stepmother?

281
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,911
- Fairy Godmother?
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

282
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,173
She stole it?

283
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,147
I show Princey!

284
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,744
Princey! Princey!

285
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,287
My Cinderelly awaits.

286
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,324
Princey, you will marry Anastasia.

287
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,881
Anesthesia.

288
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,484
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

289
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,532
She made him forget who I am.

290
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,967
Magic! That explains it.

291
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,333
Boys, we have to get that wand!

292
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,835
Madame, the King himself
has instructed me

293
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,643
to be solely in charge of this affair.

294
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,151
I assure you
I have it entirely under control.

295
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,914
Oh, really?

296
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,386
Look at that!

297
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,360
It's perfect!

298
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,427
They smell lovely.

299
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,598
Dispose of those roses at once.

300
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,505
Anastasia's health is quite...

301
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,009
Ah-choo!

302
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,943
...delicate.

303
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,447
I'm quite sure
I mentioned that to you.

304
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:28,179
- Madame, I do not...
- Quite sure.

305
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,209
Yes.

306
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:35,351
Well, perhaps the young ladies
would like to sample the hors d'oeuvres.

307
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,220
Your Grace, a word.

308
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,896
These preparations
are entirely unacceptable.

309
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,967
What a pig!

310
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,737
Who's the pig now?

311
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,474
You call this a cake?

312
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,484
This wedding must reflect
my daughter's elegance.

313
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,257
Drizella will be singing
in the ceremony.

314
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,319
Are you sure that's a good idea?

315
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,837
Oh, wait till you meet her, Dad.
She has everything.

316
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:23,203
- Breeding, refinement...
- Yes, yes.

317
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,110
No!

318
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,008
Are we in the right room?

319
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,485
You! How could you let this happen?

320
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,079
Don't mind this.

321
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,648
I shall have it cleaned up in no time.

322
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,591
See that you do!

323
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,257
I want this wedding
to go off without a hitch.

324
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,766
And if it doesn't...

325
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,837
Oh, no! Please, sire...

326
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,804
I can explain. I well, you see...

327
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:59,401
Father, allow me to introduce
my bride-to-be, Anastasia.

328
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,810
Anastasia, this is my dad.

329
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,748
It is an honor, Your Majesty.

330
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,513
Charmed, I'm sure.

331
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,560
So who's up for a dance?

332
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,559
Your little escapade back
there could have cost us everything!

333
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,194
Don't ruin this!

334
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,239
Go get him, twinkle toes.

335
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,479
Oh, I don't dance much.

336
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,988
You're too modest.
That's how we met, remember?

337
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,250
Oh, right. Of course.

338
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,054
I'll never forget
when I first touched...

339
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,687
...your hand.

340
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,670
Oh! I'm sorry.

341
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,214
It won't happen again.

342
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

343
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,782
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,562
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

345
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,462
Oh!

346
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,032
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,906
Oh, dear.

348
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,779
Um... Are you OK?

349
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,922
Oh! Oh, sorry, these aren't my shoes.

350
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,359
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course they're my shoes.

351
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,886
Oh, I just don't know
what's wrong with me today.

352
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,126
Oh, no, no, it was my fault.

353
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date
on the latest dance steps.

354
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,667
Sire, if I may, um, your fitting.

355
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:15,145
Oh. Oh, yes.
This was fun. Thank you.

356
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,875
Well, if you'll please excuse me.

357
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,882
Um, come along, sire.

358
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,252
And after the fitting,
we must approve the butter sculpture.

359
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,416
I think it's a stunning likeness.

360
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,992
Well, no grace, no poise.

361
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,794
Other than that, it was lovely.

362
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,597
He was nice to me.

363
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,605
That's because
he's under a spell.

364
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,836
He'd have to be, to fall for you.

365
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,941
It's more than that.

366
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,377
Ladies!

367
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,774
Your Majesty!

368
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,812
I need to speak with my future
daughter-in-law immediately.

369
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,620
Alone!

370
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,360
Let's make a run for it while we can.

371
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:15,839
No, sire, sire, I'll have a dozen
dance instructors sent in immediately.

372
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,238
Something's wrong.

373
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,606
An army of dance instructors.

374
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,939
No, no.

375
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,641
I thought... Why, I was sure
it was Anastasia last night.

376
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,877
But...

377
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,511
...well, just now when
I touched her hand...

378
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,550
...I felt...

379
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,392
...nothing.

380
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,861
Oh, I can explain everything,
Your Majesty.

381
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,364
I have this,
this inner ear thing and, and...

382
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,129
You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer.

383
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,834
Yes, I know, Your Majesty.

384
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,068
Reminds me of my queen.

385
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,702
She trod on my feet too.

386
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,738
But she took very good care of my heart.

387
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,915
Come here, my dear.

388
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,649
I want to show you something.

389
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,393
A princess is bestowed with many riches.

390
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,894
Land, jewels, horses.

391
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,601
But today I wish to give you
something much more valuable.

392
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,232
Oh.

393
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,972
Isn't it lovely?

394
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,676
A seashell?

395
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:35,208
This shell was the queen's
most treasured possession.

396
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,985
We found it while
walking by the water the day we met.

397
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,822
You see, we reached
for it at the same moment,

398
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,421
and when our hands touched...

399
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,297
...that's when I knew
I had found true love.

400
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,800
You knew that just by touching her hand?

401
00:32:54,872 --> 00:33:00,811
There's no more powerful
force in the world than true love.

402
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:10,080
Well, that's all. Run along, now.

403
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,646
- Run along.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

404
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,422
I do.

405
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,984
Oh, I do.

406
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,927
I do. I do.

407
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,196
I really do.

408
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,663
Oh!

409
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,004
Oh, I do.

410
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,548
You go get the Prince.

411
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,783
Bigger!

412
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,825
Ooh, let's try this!

413
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,856
Oh, that's gorgeous.

414
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,057
Lovely.

415
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:34,161
Drizella, stop that this instant!

416
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,436
This wand is not a toy.

417
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,444
It's in the dresser.
Key's in her pocket.

418
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,015
I've got to get in there.

419
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,712
Cinderelly! They'll see you!

420
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,515
- Yeah, too dangerous.
- But I...

421
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,112
We'll take care of it!

422
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,555
I do.

423
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,990
I do.

424
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,391
I do.

425
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,896
I do. Oh, I do.

426
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,571
Alright, but whatever you do,
stay clear of Lucifer.

427
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,010
Zug-zug. No Lucifee.

428
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,744
What happened?
What'd the King say?

429
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,210
He's really very nice.

430
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,050
He gave me his most prized possession.

431
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,591
A seashell?

432
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,387
It's a symbol of true love.

433
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,061
Oh, please.

434
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:38,159
- How special.
- He said that his heart...

435
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,865
What's love compared
to the power we hold with the wand?

436
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,066
You will learn that soon enough.

437
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,773
I want the Prince to love me.

438
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,813
I think he could.

439
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,146
Oh, you're serious.

440
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,742
Well, the King likes me too.

441
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,620
He treated me like his own daughter.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

442
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,957
Maybe I should
have put on the slipper.

443
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,529
Maybe we don't
even need the wand.

444
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,395
Oh!

445
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,033
Oh! Somebody put out the cat!

446
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,273
Lucifer!
Oh, hold still! Stop!

447
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,224
Lucifer!

448
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,696
Someone fetch the housekeeper.

449
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,865
Housekeeping.

450
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,039
Well, you certainly came quickly.

451
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,907
We're very good.

452
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,848
Clean this up. My daughter needs her
beauty sleep before tonight's wedding.

453
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,515
Think that'll be enough time?

454
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,065
Keep out of the maid's way, girls.

455
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,077
There's a lot to do before the wedding.

456
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,846
Hmm?

457
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,679
Isn't that right, Cinderella?

458
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,587
I didn't know you worked here.

459
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,060
You're far more persistent
than I thought.

460
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,030
I won't let you get away with this.

461
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,091
- We already have.
- I don't think so.

462
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,760
Jaq! Gus!

463
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,807
The wand!

464
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,102
Us coming, Cinderelly!

465
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,844
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

466
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,454
That servant girl is a thief! Get her!

467
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,921
Zug-zug.

468
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,588
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

469
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,971
Stop! Thief!

470
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,670
- Seize her at once!
- Don't move! Hold it!

471
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,234
Halt in the name of the King!

472
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,247
Whoa!

473
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,022
You incompetent fools!

474
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,022
Whoa!

475
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,127
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

476
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,475
Gus Gus!

477
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,850
Run, Gus Gus!

478
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,445
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

479
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,628
There she is! We've got her.

480
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,135
You there, halt!

481
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,138
Halt!

482
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,365
Open up in the name of the King!

483
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,137
Oh, hello.

484
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,705
Oh! Hey! What's going on?

485
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,309
Hmm.

486
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,378
Uh... Alright, I'm coming.

487
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,854
Cinderelly!

488
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,515
Open up, I say!

489
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,253
Gus Gus!

490
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,494
Catch.

491
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,368
Open up in the name of the King!

492
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,064
Lift the spell. Let him remember.

493
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,833
Bibbidi-bobbidi...!

494
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,433
Ooh!

495
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,674
No!

496
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,841
- What's going on?
- My apologies.

497
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,908
It's a problem with my maid.

498
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,420
- It's under control.
- Are you OK?

499
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,548
- This servant girl is a thief.
- I am not a thief.

500
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,083
You're under a spell. That's why
you don't remember me. Please!

501
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,254
Just listen!

502
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,903
Let go!

503
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:45,135
Poor child.
Obviously out of her mind.

504
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,870
I hope she'll be alright.

505
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,936
She seemed, you know,
nice when I met her.

506
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,539
Well, maybe a little confused, but,

507
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,743
still there's something about her...

508
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,118
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

509
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:02,659
I'll see to it, personally,
that she gets all the help she needs.

510
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,789
Nice try, but we won!

511
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,298
You won? What do you mean?

512
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,370
Uh... Well...

513
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,904
...nothing.

514
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,570
I... um...

515
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,803
You'll see she's taken care of?

516
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,210
Personally, Your Highness.

517
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,851
Put her on the next ship
leaving the kingdom.

518
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,285
I want her banished forever.

519
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,822
Mmm.

520
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,283
And you...

521
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,850
Keep your mouth shut or you're next.

522
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,731
Quite fetching.

523
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,892
Ouch!

524
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,959
Careful with those pins down there.

525
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,062
Dad, something strange is going on.

526
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,802
I'll say.
My son is finally getting married.

527
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,038
No. No, I mean something's wrong.

528
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:59,446
Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted
the girl who fit the glass slipper.

529
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,415
- Yes, but...
- Now you've got her.

530
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,817
Hey.

531
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,582
That's what I'm worried about.

532
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,850
Psst! Hey, Princey! Prince!

533
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,688
- Over here!
- Princey!

534
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,557
Psst! Psst!

535
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,655
- Me?
- Yes, you. Let's go.

536
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,703
OK, first birds, now mice.

537
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,330
Come on!

538
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,750
Hello?

539
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,656
Hello? Uh... little mice?

540
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,832
Well, it's official. I've lost my mind.

541
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,931
First I was hijacked by birds,
and now I'm talking to imaginary mice.

542
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,344
Hey, Prince Prince! Down here!

543
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,779
OK.

544
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,276
Maybe not so imaginary.

545
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,719
Stepmother got a magic wand,
put spell on you. Fooled everyone.

546
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,654
...came to the palace to marry you!

547
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,818
Wait, hold on. Hold on.
I think I understand.

548
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,853
Actually, I got nothing.

549
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,295
Duh... What should we gonna do?

550
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:25,891
Ahh!

551
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,457
No, I danced with Anastasia at the ball.

552
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:55,965
No, no. Princey only think that
because of Cinderelly's stepmother.

553
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,500
Yeah, mean old lady.

554
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,183
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

555
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,518
You're telling me
I'm under a magic spell?

556
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,581
And here's the worst part.

557
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,335
Gus Gus!

558
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,462
Sorry.

559
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,191
Magic?

560
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,960
Magic made me think
Anastasia was the girl at the ball?

561
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,869
That would explain everything.

562
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,564
Yeah!

563
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,982
What? The servant girl?

564
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,748
This Cinderelly? This belongs to her?

565
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,382
- Yeah! Yeah!
- I have to find her.

566
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,393
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

567
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,126
- One more time.
- Duh, yeah.

568
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,674
Oh... thanks.

569
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,944
And loved the song.

570
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,508
- Go! Go! Go, Princey! Shoo! Shoo!
- Go! Go!

571
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,246
I have to go.

572
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,418
Go? But you're about to be married.

573
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,956
But the talking mice
say she's the wrong girl.

574
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,624
Son, wait!

575
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,129
Son! Talking mice? Son?

576
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,228
Whoo-hoo!

577
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,705
- And two bluebirds.
- Talking bluebirds?

578
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:22,277
No, the bluebirds
weren't talking. Look, Dad...

579
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,870
This is ridiculous.

580
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,472
You agreed to marry
the girl in the glass slipper.

581
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,576
- I was completely with you on that one.
- And I will.

582
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,951
- Huh?
- Just as soon as I find her.

583
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:36,550
I forbid you to take
another step down these stairs!

584
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:39,752
OK.

585
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:44,294
Son! Come back!

586
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:47,302
We'll find you a doctor.
We'll have you leeched.

587
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:53,238
We've got to get...!

588
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:57,075
Guards!

589
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,670
Aye!

590
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:01,615
The servant girl. Where is she?

591
00:47:01,684 --> 00:47:04,676
Guards! He's gone completely mad!

592
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:06,551
- Your Majesty!
- Stop my son.

593
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:08,647
Your blood pressure!

594
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:10,783
Stop! Stop!

595
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,225
Dad, trust me.

596
00:47:12,294 --> 00:47:15,422
Son! I do trust you.

597
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:18,092
It's the talking mice I'm worried about.

598
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:21,803
Hiyah!

599
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:22,860
Son!

600
00:47:22,938 --> 00:47:25,338
Close the gates! Close the gates!

601
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:35,707
It'll be fine. Don't look up.

602
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:37,984
Hiyah! Hiyah!

603
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,190
Good boy.

604
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:47,528
- Yeah!
- Go get her, Princey!

605
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:52,933
I'll send the troops after him
at once, Your Majesty.

606
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:55,061
No, let him go.

607
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:57,332
But... but, Your Majesty, the wedding.

608
00:47:57,406 --> 00:47:59,067
Let him go.

609
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:19,090
Time to go.

610
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:31,372
All hands on deck.

611
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:20,549
Loose the mainsail!

612
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:41,807
Hiyah!

613
00:50:09,738 --> 00:50:12,104
Come on, boy! Nothing to it.

614
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:18,012
Hiyah!

615
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,611
Remember me?

616
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:23,505
Will you marry me, Cinderelly?

617
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:27,709
Yes, but... actually,

618
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:29,580
it's Cinderella.

619
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:32,416
Cinderella!

620
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:35,113
- It's not over yet!
- What?

621
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,057
He thinks he can ruin my plans.

622
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,560
I think not.

623
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:40,617
Who?

624
00:51:40,696 --> 00:51:43,824
The Prince. He's gone after Cinderella.

625
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:47,562
- But I thought he loved me.
- Mother!

626
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:02,644
Guards! Guards!

627
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:09,416
It's no use. The magic didn't work.

628
00:52:09,491 --> 00:52:13,120
- It wasn't as powerful as their...
- You want the Prince to love you?

629
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:14,219
Open up!

630
00:52:14,296 --> 00:52:15,923
Well, yes. Yes, of course I do.

631
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:17,898
More than anything.

632
00:52:17,966 --> 00:52:20,628
- Then do exactly as I say.
- Open up!

633
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:22,830
Open up in the name of the King!

634
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,598
Huh?

635
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:28,968
Hmm.

636
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:32,639
Using magic on my son. The nerve.

637
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:36,276
Your Majesty, we've gone over
every inch of the castle.

638
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:37,842
It appears they have fled.

639
00:52:38,754 --> 00:52:41,154
Then search my entire kingdom!

640
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:45,284
I want them found and arrested,
immediately!

641
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,921
Keep in mind that I'm an old man

642
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:52,967
and my heart can only take so much.

643
00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:55,333
Please, please, please,

644
00:52:55,404 --> 00:52:59,170
tell me that this is the girl
you intend to marry.

645
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:05,710
All the stars are shining brighter,
Dad, just like you said.

646
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:07,510
Then what are we waiting for?!

647
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:12,282
Fetch the florist!
Bake an even bigger cake.

648
00:53:12,354 --> 00:53:15,221
The wedding is on tonight!

649
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:21,629
Duh, no. This a way?

650
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:23,631
Uh, uh, uh.

651
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,633
No, no, no, no... thatta way.

652
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:26,861
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

653
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:28,898
Yes.

654
00:53:30,272 --> 00:53:31,967
Thank you.

655
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:35,506
How lovely you look, my dear.

656
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:36,908
Stepmother?

657
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:41,406
Duh.

658
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:53,057
It appears you were right, Cinderella.

659
00:53:53,662 --> 00:53:56,028
The Prince does want to marry you.

660
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:59,192
And marry you he shall.

661
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:01,065
Anastasia.

662
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:03,229
Anastasia!

663
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:19,888
Or should I say... "Cinderella."

664
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:24,552
What have you done?

665
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:26,594
The Prince won't be fooled.

666
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:28,527
The Prince will never know.

667
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:30,861
He'll be perfectly happy.

668
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:36,070
But will you, Anastasia?
Will you be happy?

669
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:39,198
I... I want what you had.

670
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:41,765
But do you even love him?

671
00:54:41,844 --> 00:54:45,143
- I...
- Love! Look where it's gotten you.

672
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:48,578
Cinderelly!

673
00:55:00,162 --> 00:55:01,652
Cinderelly!

674
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,891
What's happened, Cinderelly?

675
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:27,144
Lucifer, make absolutely certain
they don't come back...

676
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:29,281
...alive.

677
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:31,258
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

678
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,392
Huh?

679
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:43,131
Lucifer?

680
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:46,434
Hiyah!

681
00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:03,313
We need to stop this thing.

682
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:05,485
Right away, Cinderelly.

683
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:07,392
OK, OK. Chop-chop.

684
00:56:12,935 --> 00:56:15,426
Gus, can you reach the pin?

685
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:16,994
Zug-zug.

686
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:46,427
Gus Gus!

687
00:56:49,972 --> 00:56:50,961
Jaq!

688
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:58,010
Gus, hold on!

689
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:04,251
Lucifer!

690
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,048
Let him go!

691
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,419
Gus!

692
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:19,366
Huh?

693
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:21,563
Bad kitty!

694
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:34,980
Whoo-hoo!

695
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:41,889
Jaq! Gus!

696
00:58:22,197 --> 00:58:23,528
Now what are we gonna do?

697
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:26,398
Well, I'm not gonna miss my own wedding.

698
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:28,026
Whoo-hoo!

699
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,986
Oh, thank you, my dear.

700
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:51,184
This is all his mother and I
have ever wanted.

701
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:55,889
To know that our son
has found his true love.

702
00:58:55,964 --> 00:59:00,992
So, you know it's love
when you touch someone's hand, right?

703
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:02,866
At least, that's what I've heard.

704
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:06,635
Why, yes!
That's what I've always thought.

705
00:59:36,805 --> 00:59:38,500
Whoo-hoo!

706
01:00:02,364 --> 01:00:04,855
Dearly beloved...

707
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:07,902
So far, so good, Your Majesty. Hmm?

708
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:09,869
He's not married yet.

709
01:00:09,938 --> 01:00:12,907
...to join together this man

710
01:00:12,974 --> 01:00:14,965
and this woman...

711
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:17,534
My one and only Cinderella.

712
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:19,739
...in matrimony.

713
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:25,745
We're almost there.

714
01:00:28,723 --> 01:00:29,712
Whoa!

715
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:35,554
Halt!

716
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:39,794
...Cinderella,
take this man as your lawfully

717
01:00:39,868 --> 01:00:41,495
wedded husband?

718
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:44,801
You don't understand,
I must get inside.

719
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:47,842
- Please.
- Just say it. Say, "I do."

720
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,774
I...

721
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:53,279
Duh.

722
01:00:58,587 --> 01:00:59,645
I...

723
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:03,046
...don't.

724
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:05,951
Anastasia.

725
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:07,754
Cinderella.

726
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,861
Spoiled little ingrate.

727
01:01:13,935 --> 01:01:17,029
I've given you everything
you ever wanted, Anastasia!

728
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:19,767
But I want someone to love me, for me.

729
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:23,333
Guards! Guards! Seize that woman!

730
01:01:25,747 --> 01:01:27,044
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

731
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,330
- And now for you!
- Turn her into a toad, Mother.

732
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:51,668
Stop! No more!

733
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,300
- Even better.
- Cinderella!

734
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:55,900
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

735
01:01:56,645 --> 01:01:57,839
No!

736
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:02,939
No!

737
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:22,899
This is the real Cinderella,
your true love.

738
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:37,317
It's you.

739
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:57,371
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

740
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:07,045
I can't take much more of this.

741
01:03:09,818 --> 01:03:11,149
Anastasia.

742
01:03:18,393 --> 01:03:20,156
Thank you.

743
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:25,229
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

744
01:03:26,368 --> 01:03:27,995
Boo.

745
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:34,604
Oh, goodness! I certainly am stiff.

746
01:03:36,444 --> 01:03:38,002
Your Majesty...

747
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:40,681
...I don't deserve this.

748
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:49,917
Everyone deserves true love.

749
01:03:54,696 --> 01:03:56,391
Oh!

750
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,591
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

751
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,473
Thank you.

752
01:04:09,911 --> 01:04:13,506
Would you like me
to return you to your former lives?

753
01:04:14,649 --> 01:04:15,980
Former lives?

754
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,815
Why, yes. You see, you two...

755
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:21,219
Well, you were already...

756
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:23,952
Oh, never mind.

757
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:27,324
Well?
Does anyone want to marry my son?

758
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,460
I do.

759
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:37,038
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

760
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:15,202
<i>And they lived</i>
<i>happily ever after...</i>

761
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:17,267
<i>...again.</i>
