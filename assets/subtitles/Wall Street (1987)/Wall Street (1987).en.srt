1
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,850
- Easy!
- Excuse me!

2
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
Good morning. Jackson Steinem.

3
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,950
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Great, Carolyn.

4
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,580
Doing any better would be a sin.

5
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,960
Morning.

6
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,850
Morning, Dan. What's looking good today?

7
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,600
If I knew, I wouldn't be in this business.
Get out while you're young.

8
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,940
I came here one day, I sat down,
and look at me now.

9
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,150
Look at you now.

10
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,190
Morning, Brian.

11
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,070
- Chuckie! How's the woman slayer?
- Looking for an 18-year-old wife.

12
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,200
- How you doing, pal?
- Well, if I had your looks, better.

13
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,830
Takes years of genetics,
a Yale education and the right tailor.

14
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,460
Not that you learned anything, Chunk.

15
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,500
Marv, I got a feeling that we
are gonna make a killing today.

16
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,250
Yeah? Where's your machine gun?

17
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,340
You can't make a buck in this market.

18
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,430
The country's going to hell faster
than when Roosevelt was in charge!

19
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,760
Too much cheap money
sloshing around the world.

20
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,730
Worst mistake we ever made was
letting Nixon get off the gold standard.

21
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,230
Putney Drug-you boys
might wanna look at it.

22
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,690
- No. They'll take five years to come around.
- But they got a good new drug.

23
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,780
Stick to the fundamentals.
That's how IBM and Hilton were built.

24
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,910
Good things sometimes take time.

25
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,500
Look sharp, especially you rookies.
Nikkei Index closed up 90 points last night.

26
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,210
We expect heavy Japanese buying
on the opening.

27
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,420
The firm has 200,000 steel for sale.
A million Big Blue. 350,000 pork and beans.

28
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,510
Get on the horn with your institutions.
These utilities are our top priority today.

29
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,890
- OK. Let's go to work.
- And they're off and running!

30
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,490
We cleared up to 60,000 XGC at 4 81/2.
Yes, that's right. Right.

31
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,420
- The market just doubled.
- Brenner!

32
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,550
Research has put thrifts
on the recommended.

33
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,260
What? Dump it for chrissake!

34
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,050
30,000. Three-eight top.
I go along at 23. You got it.

35
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,180
Now you own it!
Conwest Air? Let me check it.

36
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,520
Circle 29,000 Niagaras for Templeton.

37
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,570
Mr Harrison, are you aware that we are
in the biggest bull market of our generation?

38
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,530
No, sir, it's not what you think.
If you take five minutes of your time...

39
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,540
Dreyfus is looking for 50,000 Conair!

40
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,160
September 50s? How about Decembers?

41
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,870
Mr Zaros? Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

42
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,420
Yes, sir, I am aware of that.

43
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,800
But if I could have five minutes
to explain the opportunities emerging...

44
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,880
...in the international debt market.

45
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,840
No, no...

46
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

47
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,770
Yes, I am aware of this. But if I could just
explain the opportunities emerging...

48
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,770
...in the international debt market...

49
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,980
I'm sure that...

50
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,870
Yesterday concerns my future.
I need the info now, before the close.

51
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,990
No, in ten minutes it's history.
At four I'm a dinosaur!

52
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,500
Howard, I thought you were a gentleman.
Sure it's gone down. You got the tip. I didn't.

53
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,540
- Why would I tell you to sell it?
- Give it back!

54
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,340
To who? I can't give it back-you own it!

55
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,130
No, he's not here.

56
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,470
- That's what you told us to say.
- Gimme that phone.

57
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,550
- Hello?
- Hello.

58
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,180
- Who am I talking to?
- The sales manager. What's the problem?

59
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,900
What? Will you gimme a break? How was
I supposed to know you were in surgery?

60
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,400
What am I - Marvin the Mindreader?!

61
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,400
Uh, no, sir. I'll discuss that with the
account executive, and I'll get back to you.

62
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,780
No, no, sir. You're welcome.

63
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,790
I'm closing the account.
If he doesn't pay tomorrow, you pay.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,290
Mr Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying.

65
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,790
We give you a rich man's account...

66
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,420
...and you tell me he's gonna DK you
for a lousy quarter point?

67
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,930
You're being unfair, sir.
You know he's got a history for bullshit.

68
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,510
Somebody's got to pay.

69
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,930
Ain't gonna be me.

70
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,440
Buddy, Buddy.
A little trouble, huh, today, Buddy?

71
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,230
Howard the jerk reneged on me. I gotta
cover his losses to the tune of seven grand.

72
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,820
Yeah! I'm holding!

73
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm tapped out. American Express
got a hit man looking for me.

74
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,410
It coulda been worse, right?
Coulda been my money.

75
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,580
Here, here, rookie, let me help you out.
I got... a C-note.

76
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,880
- Thanks, Marv. I'll make it up to you.
- Yes, I am still here!

77
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,880
You know what my dream is?
To one day be on the other end of that phone.

78
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,220
Oh, you got it, baby.
Where the real cheesecake is.

79
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,890
Hey, Bud, you forgetting something?

80
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,060
The Gekko phone call?

81
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,400
When are you gonna realise it's the big game
hunters who bag elephants, not guys like us.

82
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,690
- Gordon Gekko, please.
- Gekko's beautiful.

83
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,650
30 seconds after the Challenger blew up,
he's selling NASA stock short.

84
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,830
Yeah, but... 47 million he made
on the Melcore deal.

85
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,830
23 on the Imperial deal before he was 40.

86
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,040
The guy makes 20 times what Dave Winfield
makes in a year, and he talks to everybody.

87
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,540
And he had an ethical bypass at birth.

88
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,840
- Hello, Natalie. Guess who?
- Mr Fox.

89
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,430
Right. Every day I say to myself that today
could be the day. So will you marry me?

90
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,180
- I'll think about it.
- Then can you get me through to Mr Gekko?

91
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,230
- He's very busy.
- Of course he is. Five minutes is all I ask.

92
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:48,980
Mr Fox, I'm sure you're a good broker,
but our traders deal with the brokers.

93
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,360
Mr Gekko deals with investment bankers.

94
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,740
- Tell him I called. There are big changes...
- Yes, I'll give him your message.

95
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,500
Leo, I understand, but you have to realise
there'll be major subordinated debt involved.

96
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,720
- Buddy, how ya doing?
- Great, Charlie. Any better would be a sin.

97
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,850
Jesus Christ! Listen, I hear all you guys
on Wall Street are millionaires.

98
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,900
- When you gonna make us all rich?
- You need an account to win the lottery.

99
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,400
- Give me 50 grand. I'll get you a condo.
- Sure! We'll own the airline by then!

100
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,990
Why don't he make himself rich,
so he can pay off his school loans?

101
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,250
Nice to see you're in such a good mood, Dad.
Did Mom give you fish for dinner?

102
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,790
You smoke too much. How often you
gotta go to the hospital to realise?

103
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,500
Leave me alone. It's the only thing that
makes me feel good. There, Frank. All set.

104
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,260
Spaghetti!
Your mother still makes lousy spaghetti.

105
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,850
- It's pasta now. Spaghetti's out of date.
- So am I. You want a beer?

106
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,970
Billie! Bring a Molson Lite for the kid!

107
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,600
- Looking good, huh?
- He looks terrific.

108
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,860
Carl, we'll be at the bar.

109
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,480
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right, Charlie.

110
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,240
So...

111
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,950
You look like you've grown another inch,
but you don't look so hot, Buddy.

112
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,120
- You're gonna get bags under your eyes.
- Yeah, I had a tough day.

113
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,170
- Some jerk DK'd me. I gotta cover his loss.
- Speak English.

114
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,710
DK: Didn't Know who I was
when the options he bought took a bath.

115
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,380
- Bastard reneged on me!
- I told you not to get into that racket.

116
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,760
You coulda been a doctor or a lawyer.

117
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,720
If you'd stayed at Bluestar, you coulda been a
supervisor now, instead of being a salesman.

118
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,190
Dad, how many times I gotta tell you I am not
a salesman? I'm an account executive.

119
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,820
Soon I'm moving into investment banking.

120
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,150
You ask strangers for money -
you're a salesman.

121
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,490
Dad, it takes time.
You gotta build a client list.

122
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,450
I can make more money in one year
as a broker than in five at this airline.

123
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,620
Thank you, Billie.

124
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,420
I don't get it, kid. You borrow money to go
to NYU. First year out, you make 35 grand.

125
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,380
You made 50 grand last year, and can't
pay off your loans. Where does it go?!

126
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,920
Dad, 50K does not get you
to first base in the Big Apple.

127
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,130
I got 40% in taxes, 15 grand for rent.

128
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,010
I got school loans, car loans, food -
that's three bills a month. I need suits...

129
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,600
Come back home and live rent-free
instead of that roach-infected place.

130
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,360
$50,000! Jesus Christ!
The whole world's off its rocker!

131
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,230
I made $47,000 last year. That's before taxes.

132
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,780
That's Queens, Dad! A 5% mortgage
and you rent the top room.

133
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,290
I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player.
There is no nobility in poverty any more, Dad.

134
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,120
One day you'll be proud of me. You'll see.

135
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,920
It's yourself you gotta
be proud of, Huckleberry.

136
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,090
How much you need?

137
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,380
Can you spare 300?
I'll pay you back next month, I promise.

138
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,140
- I don't know if I got that much on me.
- Not in here. Please.

139
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,430
It adds up. 300 here, 200 there.
Your brother...

140
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,650
I always say money's something you need
in case you don't die tomorrow. Right, Carl?

141
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,650
How you doing?

142
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,280
- How's work treating you?
- Damn mandatory drug test.

143
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,200
They're driving us crazy. I got flagged for my
blood pressure pills. Can you believe that?

144
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,000
The good news is we had a meeting with
the controller about some union business.

145
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,420
Remember the accident last year
and the investigation?

146
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,170
The FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing
error in the door-latch mechanism. I knew it.

147
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,260
I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance.
It's the greedy manufacturers in Cincinnati.

148
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,810
- That's great.
- This gets us out from under suspension.

149
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,440
We can go for those new routes to Pittsburgh
and Boston. We'll compete with the big guys.

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,570
To Bluestar. As your broker, all I can
advise is you hold on to that stock.

151
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,070
What stock? Are you kiddin'?

152
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,700
- Are you sure about this thing?
- What?

153
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,370
- The FAA announcement.
- Sure I'm sure.

154
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,120
Look at me. You got that
mischievous look in your eye, Buddy.

155
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,380
You used to smile like that
when you were a kid sleeping.

156
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,300
It's true. Just like that.

157
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,050
Morning, Gordon.

158
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,770
Delivery for Mr Gekko. It's a personal item.
He needs you to sign for it.

159
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,440
Send him in.

160
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,000
Hello, Natalie. Recognise the voice? Here's
a hint-you're thinking about marrying me.

161
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,920
- Why are you here?
- You're lovelier than I pictured.

162
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,510
- Got a birthday present for Mr Gekko.
- You can't come barging in here.

163
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,390
- What makes you think it's his birthday?
- Well, it's in the bible, see?

164
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,600
You better go buy him a gift.

165
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,310
Please, Natalie, let me give this to him.
Cuban cigars. His favourite and tough to get.

166
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,400
Please, Natalie?

167
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,190
Stay here. I'll see what I can do.

168
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,710
Wait outside.

169
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,430
Yeah, I'll see you shortly, I hope.

170
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,230
Five minutes.

171
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,200
Well, life all comes down to a few moments.

172
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,910
This is one of 'em.

173
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,370
What the hell's going on?

174
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,090
I'm looking at 200,000 shares move, pal.
I wanna know if we're part of it.

175
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,260
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come
and eat your lunch for you. Back in two.

176
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,720
Sorry, Jeff. Look, I loved it at 40.
It's an insult at 50.

177
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,480
Their analysts don't know
preferred stock from livestock.

178
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,610
Wait till it heads south, then we raise the
sperm count on the deal. Get back at ya.

179
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,360
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days in a row.
Wants to be a player.

180
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,490
Oughta be in the dictionary
under "persistence".

181
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,080
Listen, Jerry, I'm looking for negative control.
No more than 30, 35%.

182
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,830
Just enough to block anybody else's merger
plans, and find out if the books are cooked.

183
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,590
If it looks as good as on paper,
we're in the kill zone, pal.

184
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,630
Lunch? You kiddin'? Lunch is for wimps.
OK, Billy. I'll talk at ya.

185
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,100
How do you do, Mr Gekko? I'm Bud Fox.

186
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,430
So you say. Nice to meet you.
Hope you're intelligent.

187
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,150
- Where'd you get these?
- I got a connection at the airport.

188
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,900
So what's on your mind, kemo sabe?
Why am I listening to you?

189
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,740
I gotta monitor my blood pressure,
so don't upset me.

190
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,320
No. No, sir.

191
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,620
In 45 seconds, the microprocessor computes
your systolic and diastolic pressure.

192
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,210
Got an LCD read-out, cost-effective...
Less than one visit to a doctor.

193
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,470
I just wanna let you know I've read all about
you at NYU Business. I think you're a genius.

194
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,470
I've always dreamed of one thing and
that's to do business with a man like you.

195
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,850
- What firm you with?
- Jackson Steinem.

196
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,690
They're going places.
Good junk-bond department.

197
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,690
You the financing on
that Jansen investment?

198
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,150
Yeah. I'm working on
some other interesting stuff.

199
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,740
Cosmetic company, by any chance?

200
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,570
Are you twelfth man on the deal team?
Last to know?

201
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,040
- I can't tell you that, Mr Gekko.
- So what you got for me, sport?

202
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,870
Chart breakout on
Whitewood-Young Industries.

203
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,670
Explosive earnings. A 30% discount from
book. Great cash flow. Couple of 5% holders.

204
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,540
- It's a dog.
- Strong management.

205
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,340
It's a dog, pal. What else you got
besides connections at the airport?

206
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,550
Mr Stevenson in San Francisco.

207
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,520
- He respond?
- Lecturing on economics.

208
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
- What?!
- No, he's in Chicago.

209
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,610
Why the hell is Cromwell giving a lecture
tour when he's losing 60 million a quarter?!

210
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,320
Guess he's giving lectures
in how to lose money.

211
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,530
If this guy owned a funeral parlour,
no one would die! This turkey is braindead!

212
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,330
OK. All right, Christmas is over,
and business is business.

213
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,330
You keep on buying. Dilute the son of a bitch!

214
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,210
Ollie, I want every orifice
in his fuckin' body flowin' red!

215
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,500
He's flowin', Gordo. Piece of cake.

216
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,010
This guy's the best trader on the street.

217
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,010
Susan, get me the LBO analysis
on Teldar Paper. Bring it in here, please.

218
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,220
- Mr Gekko, your wife.
- What else you got?

219
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,480
Terafly. Analysts don't like it. I do.
The break-up value is twice the market price.

220
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,610
This deal finances itself.
You sell off two divisions...

221
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,150
Not bad for a quant,
but that's a dog with different fleas.

222
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,610
Come on, pal.
Tell me something I don't know.

223
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,990
It's my birthday.

224
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,200
Surprise me.

225
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,830
- Bluestar.
- What?

226
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,300
- Bluestar Airlines.
- Rings a bell somewhere. So what?

227
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,510
It's a comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots.

228
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:44,220
Flies to Florida, Canada,
uh, Northeast, the Caribbean.

229
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,060
- Great slots in major cities.
- I don't like airlines. Lousy unions.

230
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,310
Well, there was a crash last year.

231
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,230
They just got a favourable
ruling on a lawsuit.

232
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,150
Even the plaintiffs don't know about it.

233
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
Well, how do you know about it?

234
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,660
I just know.

235
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,200
The decision should clear the way
for new planes and routes.

236
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,290
There's only a small float. You should grab it.
Good for a five-point pop.

237
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,000
250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Jansen.

238
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,630
I can pull twice that at 18 1/2
from the California pensions.

239
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,970
We got close to half a million
shares in the bag.

240
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,640
The Terminator!
Blow 'em away, Ollie!

241
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,890
We got the Beezer Brothers.
I'm working on the Silverberg boys.

242
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,600
Rip their fuckin' throats out!
Stuff 'em in your garbage compactor!

243
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,770
Interesting. Got a card?

244
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,480
Home number's on the back.

245
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,360
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred
deals a day. I choose one.

246
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,990
- I hope to hear from you, sir.
- Thanks for the cigars.

247
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,240
Let's go, guys. Looks like
we're going over 5% in Teldar.

248
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,250
Start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13D.

249
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,290
We buy everything in sight,
but we don't pay over 22.

250
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,340
They'll fight. They got Myers
and Thromberg doing their legal.

251
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,430
- Thanks, Natalie.
- Have a nice day, Mr Fox.

252
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,510
Mr Gekko, your conference call is ready. Mr
Sugarman in Delaware, Mr Bernard in LA...

253
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,770
...Mr Jackson and Ms Rosco
in London. They're all on.

254
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,190
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm in a bind down here.

255
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,730
We got all these damn new computers and
young men that are edging me out here.

256
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,780
Hey, Bud! Did he see you?

257
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,410
Yeah, he saw right through me.

258
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,160
Cheer up. You shook Gekko's hand
and you still got all your fingers.

259
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,580
Besides, he's not the only
elephant in the jungle.

260
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,340
Holy cow! Did you get something
from him? Teldar Paper, huh?

261
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,170
Nah. It's a dog with fleas.

262
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,010
Fox, where have you been
for the last three hours, hm?

263
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,180
If I were you, and I thank
my personal God I am not...

264
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,890
...I wouldn't be sitting around chinwagging.

265
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,480
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip-code pile to cold-call.

266
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:06,110
Buddy, I got tickets for the Knick game
tonight. Cruise some chicks afterwards.

267
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,280
Whaddaya say?

268
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,410
- No, I gotta read my charts.
- Forget charts, will ya?

269
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,330
We're not fund managers.
Churn 'em and burn 'em!

270
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,830
I am offering you the Knicks and chicks.

271
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,420
God help you before you turn
into poor Steeples over there.

272
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,170
Preferably Lou Mannheim.

273
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,220
Yeah, nice guy, but he's a loser. He lost all
his equity when the firm went belly-up in '71.

274
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,350
You wanna be in your sixties still pitching?

275
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,940
Hey, Buddy, whatever happened to
that cute analyst at Thudder and Wicks?

276
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,900
Cindy. Having sex with her
was like reading the Wall Street Journal.

277
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,280
- She had a heartbeat.
- You wanna bet?

278
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,320
I gotta get to work. Zs today.

279
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,740
Call for you, Buddy! Pick up two!

280
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,370
- Bud Fox.
- All right, Bud Fox.

281
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,040
I want you to buy 20,000 shares of Bluestar...

282
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,050
...at fifteen and an eighth,
three-eighths tops.

283
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,390
And don't screw it up, sport.

284
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,890
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir! Thank you. You won't regret this.

285
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,140
Whoo! Marv, I just bagged the elephant!

286
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,770
Gekko?

287
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,020
- Hiya, sport.
- Nice to see you again, Mr Gekko.

288
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,560
Try the steak tartare. It's off the menu.
Louis'll make it for you.

289
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,780
- Of course, sir. Anything to drink?
- Just an Evian, please.

290
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,360
Hey, see this? Can you believe it?
It's got a two-inch screen.

291
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,870
I can hardly see it.

292
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,910
It's for my kid - Rudy.
Three years old, he's an electronics freak.

293
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,960
We're going into a new age, pal.

294
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,750
So how's business today?

295
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,550
Great. Bluestar was at 17 1/4
when I left the office. Up from 15.

296
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,760
Might spin up to 18 by the bell.

297
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,390
Teldar's shooting up.
Did you buy any for yourself?

298
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:39,180
I bet you were on the phone
two minutes after you got out of my office.

299
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,650
No, sir, that wouldn't have been legal.

300
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,320
Sure. Relax, pal.
No one's gonna blow the whistle on you.

301
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,530
Is that legal? Why don't you
put that in my account?

302
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,200
- Hey, Gordon!
- Georgie! The cellular king! How you been?

303
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,540
- Monique, nice to see you, my dear.
- Hello, Gordon.

304
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,500
- You look wonderful.
- You're looking very well yourself.

305
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,670
And Mr Davis...

306
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,960
Can I get the check here, please?
For chrissakes!

307
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,390
Cover that Bluestar buy. Put 200 thou on one
of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned.

308
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:20,600
Pick the dog with the least fleas.
Use a stop-loss, so your downside's 100 thou.

309
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,400
And buy a decent suit.
You can't come in here looking like this.

310
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,690
Go to Morty Sills. Tell him I sent you.

311
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,570
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr Gekko. Thank you
for the chance. You will not regret this.

312
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,360
You're with a winner.

313
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,320
Right... right...

314
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,080
Put the rest of the money in a tax-free fund.
I wanna see how you do before I invest it.

315
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,790
And save the cheap salesman talk.
It's obvious.

316
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,500
- Excuse me, sir?
- You heard me.

317
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,590
I don't like losses, sport.
Nothing ruins my day more than losses.

318
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,050
Now you do good... you get perks.

319
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,760
Lots and lots of perks.

320
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,810
- Louis, take care of my friend.
- Thank you, sir.

321
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,020
Have a good lunch, Buddy.

322
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,770
Hi, Richard.

323
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,260
Hi, Bud.

324
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,600
Hi.

325
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,930
I'm Lisa. A friend of Gordon's.

326
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,070
Lisa? Gordon? Oh, oh, Mr Gekko. Sure.

327
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,900
Uh, would you like to come in?

328
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,110
Didn't he tell you?

329
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,030
Oh, that's so like Gordon.

330
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,410
Why don't you get dressed? We're going out.

331
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,120
We are?

332
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,560
So... where are we going?

333
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,730
Wherever you like.

334
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,020
Lutéce. 21. The River Café.

335
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,240
Or maybe we could just...

336
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,700
...drive around for a while.

337
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,950
Work up an appetite.

338
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,290
Want some?

339
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,300
Gordon tells me that
you're a very talented broker.

340
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,260
What do you like?

341
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,310
Like? Well...

342
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,270
I've got this guy who tells me
to buy Hewlett-Packard...

343
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,850
...but I've been burned on tips.

344
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,980
Uh... Hewlett.
Now, let's see. It closed at 41 1/4.

345
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,110
Up an eighth. Very attractive.

346
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,070
About, uh... average yield.

347
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,660
Very attractive.

348
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,080
Rising profits.

349
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,170
Strong balance sheet.

350
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,130
You're hot on this stock.

351
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,960
Uh... It's ready to take off.

352
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,300
I'd jump all over it if I were you.

353
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,720
- Good morning, Carolyn.
- Morning. You look happy.

354
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,890
- Any better and I'd be guilty.
- You were never innocent, sugar pie.

355
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,600
How do you know? You wish!

356
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,730
Goddamn! We sure went down
the toilet on that ugly bitch!

357
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:17,770
Oh, Buddy! Mr Gekko's office is looking
for you. Be at the Wyatt Club courts at six.

358
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,830
Come on, sport. You gotta try harder.

359
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,370
I need some exercise, for chrissakes.

360
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,760
- I don't think I can go on, Mr Gekko.
- Push yourself. Finish out the game.

361
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,380
It's a very nice club, Mr Gekko.

362
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,260
Yeah.

363
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,890
Not bad for a City College boy.

364
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,140
Bought my way in. Now all these Ivy League
schmucks are sucking my kneecaps.

365
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,400
I just got on the board of the Bronx Zoo.

366
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,030
It cost me a mil.

367
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,780
That's the thing you gotta
remember about WASPs.

368
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,120
They love animals,
but they can't stand people.

369
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,500
Uh, Mr Gekko...

370
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,620
...we took a little loss today.

371
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,300
We got stopped out on Terafly.
About a hundred grand.

372
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Well, I guess your dad's not a union
representative of that company, huh?

373
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,810
How do you know about my father?

374
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,310
The most valuable commodity
I know of is information.

375
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,020
Wouldn't you agree?

376
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,320
Yeah.

377
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,580
The public's out there
throwing darts at a board, sport.

378
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,040
I don't throw darts at a board.
I bet on sure things.

379
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,000
Read Sun Tzu, The Art of War.

380
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,300
"Every battle is won before it's ever fought."

381
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,090
Think about it.

382
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,720
You're not as smart as I thought you were.

383
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,980
You ever wonder why fund managers
can't beat the S&P 500?

384
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,440
Cos they're sheep.
And sheep get slaughtered.

385
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,320
I've been in this business since '69.

386
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,990
Most of these Harvard MBA types
don't add up to dogshit.

387
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,660
You need guys that are poor,
smart and hungry. And no feelings.

388
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:39,040
You win a few, you lose a few,
but you keep on fighting.

389
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,380
And if you need a friend, get a dog.
It's trench warfare out there, pal.

390
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,550
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey, Gordon.

391
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,720
- How's Larchmont treating you?
- Fine. How's the Praxar deal going?

392
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,550
- You should know, pal.
- Asshole!

393
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,310
And inside here, too.

394
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,350
I got 20 other brokers analysing charts, pal.
I don't need another one.

395
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,570
See you around, Buddy.

396
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,110
I am not just another broker, Mr Gekko.
If you give me another chance, I'll prove it.

397
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,080
I'll go the extra yard for you.
Just one more chance, Mr Gekko. Please!

398
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,330
Want another chance? Then stop sending me
information, and start getting me some.

399
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,090
Get dressed. I'll show you my charts.

400
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,800
- You know the name?
- Larry Wildman, one of the first raiders.

401
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:39,020
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits, thinks
he was born with a better pot to piss in.

402
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,940
Bribed an old secretary of mine
to open her mouth.

403
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,480
Stole RDL Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.

404
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,570
Wildman, the "White Knight".

405
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,110
I remember that deal.
You were involved, Mr Gekko?

406
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,200
Payback time, sport.

407
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,830
See that building? I bought that building
ten years ago. My first real-estate deal.

408
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,000
Sold it two years later.
Made an $800,000 profit.

409
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,630
It was better than sex.

410
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:12,050
At the time I thought that was all the money
in the world. Now it's a day's pay.

411
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,340
Anyway, I had a mole in Wildman's operation.

412
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,810
- He gave me half the picture, then got fired.
- I don't think I follow you.

413
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:25,190
Wildman's in town.
He just became an American citizen.

414
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,810
Something big is going down, OK?

415
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:33,530
I wanna know where he goes, what he sees.
I want you, pal, to fill out the missing picture.

416
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,120
Mr Gekko, it's not exactly what I do.
I could lose my licence.

417
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,250
If the SEC found out, I could go to jail.
That's inside information, isn't it?

418
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,750
Like when a father tells his son
about a court ruling on an airline?

419
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,010
Or someone overhears I'm buying Teldar,
and decides he's gonna buy some?

420
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:00,140
Or the chairman of the board of XYZ
decides it's time to blow out XYZ?

421
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,220
Is that what you mean?

422
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,940
Unless your father's on the board
of directors of another company...

423
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,110
...you and I are gonna have a very
tough time doing business together.

424
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,530
- What about hard work?
- What about it? You work hard?

425
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,830
Bet you stayed up analysing that stock
you gave me. Where'd it get you?

426
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:27,040
My father worked like an elephant till
he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack.

427
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,210
Wake up, will ya, pal?

428
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,670
If you're not inside, you are outside, OK?

429
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,300
I'm not talking about some
$400,000-a-year Wall Street stiff...

430
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,010
...flying first class and being comfortable.
I'm talking about liquid.

431
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,020
Rich enough to have your own jet.

432
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,060
Rich enough not to waste time.

433
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,060
Fifty, a hundred million dollars, Buddy.

434
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,110
A player...

435
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,280
...or nothing.

436
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,280
Now you had what it took
to get into my office.

437
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,370
The real question is whether
you got what it takes to stay.

438
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,670
Look at that.

439
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:14,460
You're gonna tell me the difference
between this guy and that guy is luck?

440
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,550
Mohammed, pull over.

441
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,100
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
drop you off here. I'm late.

442
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Buddy, it's been nice meeting you, OK?

443
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,830
All right, Mr Gekko.

444
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,170
You got me.

445
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,360
Excuse me, please.

446
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,110
Excuse me.

447
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,540
I'm sorry, sir. Do you have a reservation?

448
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,800
- Uh, table for one.
- Reservations only. We're booked for a week.

449
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,590
All right. Don't touch.

450
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,290
Everything ready, sir.

451
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,890
Excuse me! Is Mr Wildman
on board that plane?

452
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,980
Shit! My boss is gonna kill me!
I'm supposed to give him this.

453
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,310
- You know where that plane is going?
- Erie, Pennsylvania.

454
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,480
Thank you.

455
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,160
After spending the morning at Kahn
Seidelman in the junk-bond department...

456
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,490
...he had lunch at that restaurant, Le Circus,
with some well-dressed bean counters.

457
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,170
He later stopped off at Morgan. I'd say
from all the smiling and palm-pressing...

458
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,090
...Larry got himself some
nice fat financing, GG.

459
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,670
Bright, but not bright enough, Sherlock.
Roll the dice and play Monopoly.

460
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,220
What box is Sir Larry gonna
land on in Erie, Pennsylvania?

461
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,640
Jesus Christ! He's buying Anacott Steel.

462
00:39:53,770 --> 00:40:00,440
OK. When the market opens tomorrow,
I want you to buy 1500 July 50 calls.

463
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,820
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

464
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,820
And start buying 1,000-share blocks
and take it up to $50.

465
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:12,330
When it reaches 50,
give out a little taste to your friends.

466
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:17,540
Then I want you to call
the Wall Street Chronicle, extension 1605.

467
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:22,840
You tell the man
"Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel".

468
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,460
- You got that?
- The Wall Street Chronicle.

469
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,930
Congratulations, Buddy.
You scored. I'll talk at ya.

470
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,180
Start buying Anacott Steel across the board.

471
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,810
Use the offshore accounts.

472
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,940
And keep it quiet.

473
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,490
Frank, 10,000 ANC at 46. Let me know
how the options are opening, OK?

474
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,290
Thank you.

475
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,920
Jackson Steinem!

476
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,590
- How is Anacott Steel?
- 5 3/4, 6. 2,000 up.

477
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,380
- Six at 10,000.
- I'll sell you 2,000.

478
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,430
That's not what I said. I said 20,000 shares.

479
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,690
Anacott trades at six.

480
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,530
- 8,000 at a quarter?
- I'll take 8,000.

481
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,950
Make it six to a half, 2,000 up.

482
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,330
I know what time it is,
and this is what I'm saying.

483
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:41,580
We have important financial news, Mr Erlich,
that just happens to concern your future.

484
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:47,420
- You could benefit... What's going on?
- Anacott Steel. Put your best customers in it.

485
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,130
Lou, I got a sure thing.

486
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,430
Anacott Steel.

487
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:01,180
No such thing, except death and taxes. Not
a good company any more. No fundamentals.

488
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,190
What's goin' on, Bud?

489
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,360
You know something?

490
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,450
Remember, there are no short cuts, son.

491
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,410
Quick-buck artists come and go
with every bull market.

492
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,410
The steady players make it
through the bear markets.

493
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,500
You're a part of something here, Bud.

494
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,420
The money you make for people creates
science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.

495
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,090
You're right, but you gotta get to the
big time first, then you can do good things.

496
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,300
- You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.
- Lou, trust me. It's a winner. Buy it.

497
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,850
We'll kamikaze over to Nell's,
chase some cotton underwear.

498
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,230
I know this 18-year-old bimbette
that's gorgeous. Hold on.

499
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,860
- Play tennis Saturday?
- Can't. Fly-fishing in Canada. Real big client.

500
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,780
- Take Anacott?
- Light snack, but good. Thanks, pal.

501
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,700
You're sharking your way up.

502
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,040
No, no, my dear, you've got to diversify.

503
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,040
I got a sure thing. Anacott Steel.

504
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,880
I've just heard the most lovely two words.

505
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,250
Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.

506
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,710
Anacott Steel.

507
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,570
Looks like Anacott Steel's in play.
Check the ARBs.

508
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,570
Looks like it's being accumulated.

509
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,790
Lou? Anacott. I buy. Yeah.
Take it and bid it.

510
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,620
Quarters won't matter.
Keep taking Anacott.

511
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,540
This is special. Anacott. Paint the tape.

512
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,830
- Bet the ranch.
- Buy 100,000 shares.

513
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,840
- Wildman is sniffing around.
- It's on automatic pilot to the moon.

514
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,090
- If it hits 75, we'll clean 24 mil.
- Relax, pal.

515
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,260
Don't get emotional about stock.
It clouds the judgment.

516
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:05,560
Which closed at 51 1/8, up 5 1/8 from
yesterday's close on heavy trading.

517
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,870
Can I help you?

518
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,120
Yes, I'm Bud Fox. I have some
papers for Mr Gekko to sign.

519
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,620
- Come in.
- Thank you.

520
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,460
- I'm sorry about this, Mr Gekko.
- It's all right. It's OK.

521
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,010
You wanna wait here?

522
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,340
Problems?

523
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,050
No problem.
This is Bud Fox. My wife, Kate.

524
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,390
- Hello. You came out from the city?
- Yes, ma'am.

525
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,640
Ah, long drive. You want a drink?

526
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,940
Yeah, you want a drink? Um... sure.

527
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,860
- If you'd rather not.
- No, come on. Have a drink.

528
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,900
Get to meet all the people.
It's a good idea.

529
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:02,620
We got Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston. This is Bud Fox.

530
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,740
His illustrious wife, Muffie.

531
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:10,420
Candice Rogers, Dick Brady.
Darien Taylor. All old friends.

532
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,790
Hi.

533
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:22,300
Great idea, Gordon. I know good help is hard
to find, but can it create a dry vodka martini?

534
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,010
It doesn't talk back or steal the silverware.

535
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,680
And Dick here is gonna get me
an exemption, aren't you?

536
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:34,520
I'm in St Kitts with this new
Kamali leopard-skin V-cut bikini...

537
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,320
...which is gonna turn back the clock on my
marriage five years. Know what I mean?

538
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,280
Call for you, sir. Sir Lawrence Wildman.
He says it's important.

539
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,030
Thank you, Nyung.

540
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,540
Would you fix Mr Livingston another
martini? Stick around. This could be fun.

541
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:54,540
It's all because this Ukrainian bitch
botched the job on my wax on my bikini line.

542
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,500
How ghastly! Sue her.

543
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,050
- Larry, what a surprise!
- I want to see you, Gordon.

544
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,550
Can it wait till tomorrow? I got people here.

545
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,970
- No, this can't wait. It's important.
- OK. If you feel that way, come on over.

546
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,100
Ah! There you are!
Can I steal him for a minute?

547
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,810
- Of course.
- I want your opinion.

548
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,820
So what do you see in this?

549
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,420
Purity. Innocence.

550
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,420
A few thousand dollars
down the tubes, if you ask me.

551
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,420
Really?

552
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,760
You can kiss your career
as an art appraiser goodbye.

553
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,930
We paid over 400,000 for it at the
contemporary picture sale last June.

554
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,270
Jesus, you could've had
a whole beach house for that!

555
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,690
Sure you could. In Wildwood, New Jersey.

556
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,820
If you sold this one, you could
have a nice penthouse on Fifth.

557
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,990
You wouldn't have much
left over for decoration.

558
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,280
It's nice, if you're on mushrooms.

559
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,160
I thought Gordon was a tough businessman.
He sure has taken a bath on that.

560
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:17,210
A bath? I'd say Gordon is one of
the most astute collectors around.

561
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,960
He has a great eye, and he only buys the best.

562
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:26,380
Like this rug, for instance.
A Bokhara. It's the finest of its kind.

563
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,470
After he bought it, a dealer
representing the Saudi royal family...

564
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,060
...offered him twice what he paid.
It absolutely makes the room.

565
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,860
See how this bit of celadon in the border
is picked up by these cushions?

566
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,030
Although it's a sacrilege
having that Etruscan vase on the table.

567
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,610
Some dope might use it as an ashtray.

568
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,700
- I guess you're a decorator?
- You got it.

569
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,500
A great spender of other people's money.

570
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,170
If you're that good, I'm sure you
can do wonders with my place.

571
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,170
- Where would that be?
- Upper West Side.

572
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:05,300
Really? Home of the exposed
brick wall and the houseplant?

573
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:11,010
It's just a rental. I'll be moving to the East
Side soon. Some deals brewing with Gordon.

574
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,140
But that's just conversation.
What about real things?

575
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:19,690
Like dinner? The two of us... next Friday?
Café Santo Domingo.

576
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,020
What if I have a previous engagement?

577
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,190
You break it.

578
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,490
There you go again, Darien.
Talking with strange men.

579
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:34,080
Hello. Sam, do you know Bud Fox?
Sam is in banking.

580
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,710
- Works for Gordon.
- Nice meeting you.

581
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,380
- Are you staying for dinner?
- No, I have work to do.

582
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,460
- Ah. The bell.

583
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,050
Excuse me.

584
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,300
Call me next week. I'll give you an estimate.

585
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,810
- Larry, how have you been?
- Fine. Travelling, actually.

586
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,230
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

587
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,780
Larry! Excuse me. Sir Larry.

588
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,160
How are ya? Goddamn, you look great!

589
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,490
- Gordon.
- So you wanna talk.

590
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,540
- I'll be heading back now, Mr Gekko.
- Stick around.

591
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,580
This is one of my gang. Bud Fox.

592
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,540
Shall we go upstairs?

593
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah.

594
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,230
The rarest pistol in the world, Larry.

595
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,640
A.45 Luger.

596
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,770
Only six of 'em were ever manufactured.

597
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,110
Congratulations.

598
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,070
Rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.

599
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,790
My interest is the same as yours. Money.
Thought it'd be a good investment for my kid.

600
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,790
No, this time I'm in for the long term. It's
not a liquidation. I'm gonna turn it around.

601
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,040
You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate.

602
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,130
With the dollars you're costing me to
buy back stock, I could modernise the plant.

603
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,180
I'm not the only one who pays here, Gordon.

604
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,560
We're talking about lives and jobs.
Four generations of steelworkers...

605
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:25,020
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you got
CNX Electronics, you laid off 6,000 workers.

606
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,570
Jemson Fruit, 4,000.
That airline you bought, um...

607
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,740
I could break you, mate.
In two pieces over my knees.

608
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,240
You know it. I know it.

609
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,160
I could buy you six times over.

610
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,870
I could dump the stock just to burn your arse!

611
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,080
But I happen to want the company,
and I want your block of shares.

612
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,460
I'm announcing
a tender offer at 65 tomorrow.

613
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,380
I'm expecting your commitment.

614
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,850
Showdowns bore me, Larry. Nobody wins.
You can have the company.

615
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:05,270
In fact, it'll be fun watching you and your
giant ego trying to make a horse race of it.

616
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,110
Buddy, what's a fair price for that stock?

617
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,440
The break-up value is higher. It's worth 80.

618
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:17,570
Well, we don't want to be greedy.
So what do you say to 72?

619
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,290
You're a two-bit pirate and greenmailer.
Nothing more...

620
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,710
...Gekko.

621
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,960
Not only would you sell your mother
to make a deal, you'd send her COD.

622
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:36,010
My mail is the same colour as yours is, pal.

623
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,970
Or at least it was until the Queen
started calling you "Sir".

624
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,850
Excuse me before I lose my temper.

625
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,520
71?

626
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,950
Considering you brought my mother into it...

627
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,700
...71.50.

628
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,370
Done.

629
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,120
You'll hear from my lawyers
tomorrow, 8am. Good night.

630
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:18,340
He's right, I had to sell.
The key to the game is capital reserves.

631
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:23,260
If you don't have enough, you can't piss
in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

632
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,480
"All warfare is based on deception." Sun Tzu.

633
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,230
"If your enemy is superior, evade him."

634
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,730
"If angry, irritate him."

635
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:38,280
"If equally matched, fight.
And if not, split. Re-evaluate."

636
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,870
He's learning, huh? Buddy's learning!

637
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,175
- Yeah?
- Money never sleeps, pal.

638
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:00,005
Just made 800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
It's been wired to you.

639
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:05,555
Play with it. You done good,
but you gotta keep doing good.

640
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:08,895
I showed you how the game works.
Now school's out.

641
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,025
Mr Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

642
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:16,815
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.
I wanna be surprised.

643
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:23,285
Astonish me, pal. New info.
I don't care where or how you get it.

644
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:25,865
Just get it.

645
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:31,085
My wife tells me you made a move on Darien.

646
00:53:32,255 --> 00:53:34,335
Here's some inside info for you.

647
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,755
That GQ type she's going out with
got big bucks...

648
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,465
...but he's putting her feet to sleep.

649
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:43,305
Exit visas are imminent.

650
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:46,435
I don't want you losing your place in line.

651
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:50,265
Ah, Jesus!

652
00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:52,895
I wish you could see this.

653
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,105
The light's coming up.

654
00:53:59,655 --> 00:54:03,745
I've never seen a painting that
captures the beauty of the ocean...

655
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:06,115
...at a moment like this.

656
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,625
I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox.

657
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:15,625
Yeah. Rich enough
that you can afford a girl like Darien.

658
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,335
This is your wake-up call, pal.

659
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,545
Go to work.

660
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,485
- Fox!
- Mr Barnes.

661
00:54:41,065 --> 00:54:45,535
Buddy D, is this déjá vu?
What's it been? A year, year and a half?

662
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:48,245
So, I hear you're moving up in the world.

663
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:52,535
A senior associate. Not bad. Not bad.
How's Margie?

664
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:56,085
I can't complain.
I got a house in Oyster Bay, you know.

665
00:54:56,165 --> 00:54:58,375
Market treating you good?

666
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:03,465
- Still seeing that sexy French chick?
- No. No. She asked the wrong question.

667
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:06,595
- What was that?
- "What are you thinking?"

668
00:55:09,845 --> 00:55:14,225
The hours are hell, but the cash
is starting to tumble in.

669
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:19,025
I know this guy who has an ironclad way
of making money. I can't lose or get hurt.

670
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:23,905
Can't get hurt. So does this guy
have a tip for an honest lawyer?

671
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:27,865
Maybe. Check out Teldar Paper...

672
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,285
...but don't quote me.

673
00:55:31,205 --> 00:55:37,045
And you? I hear you're handling the Fairchild
Foods merger, and it may not go through.

674
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:40,795
Any surprises I haven't read about
in the Wall Street Journal?

675
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:44,545
Come on, that's illegal.
You wouldn't wanna get me disbarred.

676
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:49,055
Who's listening?
Just one college buddy talking to another.

677
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:53,855
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, relax, Roger.

678
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,145
Everybody's doing it now.

679
00:55:56,645 --> 00:56:00,395
But, if you don't know,
then... you don't know.

680
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:08,445
And if I did...

681
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:10,745
...what's in it for moi?

682
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:14,915
More money than you ever dreamed of.

683
00:56:15,835 --> 00:56:17,915
Nobody gets hurt.

684
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,665
You think about it.

685
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:28,465
- Let's grab a beer. What do you say?
- Uh... too much to do. But I'll walk you out.

686
00:56:30,425 --> 00:56:32,515
The file's on the desk, Marie.

687
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:36,395
Get inside my uncle's door
and the secrets of the world are yours.

688
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:38,265
Lifeblood of companies...

689
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:42,235
Of course, you gotta go
to law school first, but...

690
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:02,125
Mr Panos, I've been charting
the growth of office space.

691
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:05,045
You're in the right business
at the right time.

692
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,255
Thank you for tell me what I already know.

693
00:57:07,345 --> 00:57:11,215
Look, I'm very impressed with your work,
and I could use a tax break.

694
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:15,265
Let me ask, what would you say to
some working capital and a partner?

695
00:57:15,395 --> 00:57:17,265
Why do I need a partner?

696
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:21,725
Look, you need more vans. 42 employees
can't cover the buildings you got...

697
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,445
...not to mention the clients
we'd have together.

698
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:29,235
I am an expert at identifying undervalued
assets such as this business.

699
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:21,165
The good news, Gordon,
is Rorker Electronics.

700
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:24,415
That's right. I see it happening
in the next two months.

701
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:27,215
Come on, their quarterlies are for shit.

702
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:30,045
I got a little gift for you.

703
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:34,845
Gordon will be very pleased.
What else have you got?

704
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:41,515
You know Marty Weidman?

705
00:58:41,515 --> 00:58:45,275
He netted 650G off of that merger.
26 years old, the guy's Rambo.

706
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,565
- He's an asshole!
- He is Rambo!

707
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,565
He's got a Porsche Turbo
Cabriolet, about 75 thou.

708
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:55,495
I think if I can make a bundle of cash
before I'm 30 and get out of this racket...

709
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:58,825
...l'll be able to ride
my motorcycle across China.

710
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:03,625
I'd like to do for furniture what
Laura Ashley did for interior fabrics.

711
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:06,955
Produce a line of high-quality
antiques at a low price.

712
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:09,255
Sounds great. I'll take you public.

713
00:59:09,335 --> 00:59:11,215
You will?

714
00:59:35,115 --> 00:59:37,615
Can I help you?

715
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:41,365
Oh. Excuse me. Is this Bill Bates' office?

716
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:42,825
No.

717
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:44,785
I'm sorry.

718
00:59:55,215 --> 00:59:57,425
Hiya, Dad.

719
00:59:57,425 --> 01:00:01,055
- What brings you out here?
- Client's got a private jet at Butler.

720
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:03,765
- Hey, Buddy. How ya doing?
- Mr Wall Street!

721
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:05,975
The bozos that keep us in the air!

722
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:08,565
- Give us a hand.
- Do an honest day's work.

723
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:12,025
All right. Change the oil,
fill the tyres and park it out back.

724
01:00:12,105 --> 01:00:14,195
This kid wanna buy the plane?

725
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:18,155
- You always light up when you see me.
- Don't start, all right?

726
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,945
All right.

727
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:22,245
So who peed in your Cheerios?

728
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:25,165
Goddamn fare wars are killing us!

729
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:28,495
Management's gonna lay off
five of my men this week.

730
01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:30,465
I'm sorry about that.

731
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:34,545
- So how much you need?
- I don't need anything. I'm doing great.

732
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:37,885
New client, new ball game.
Things are starting to happen.

733
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:40,805
Sure. Lots of guys at the track talk like that.

734
01:00:40,885 --> 01:00:45,685
How do you know you'll have any dough
next month? Jesus Christ, what is this?

735
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:47,685
It's a dividend.

736
01:00:47,765 --> 01:00:50,685
I've borrowed at least five grand
over the years.

737
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:54,235
Oh, stop it.
Put this towards your school loan.

738
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:59,155
Forget the loans. Look, Dad, things
are good and it's gonna stay that way.

739
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:02,155
- Buy yourself a new suit.
- What do I need a suit for?

740
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:05,495
I don't hobnob with the jet set.
I just fix their planes.

741
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:10,835
Then get a decent bowling jacket, so you
don't look like the Roto-Rooter man.

742
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:13,335
Come on, what's money for? Enjoy yourself.

743
01:01:13,415 --> 01:01:16,545
Money is a pain in the ass,
if you ask me. But thanks, kid.

744
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:19,385
- How about dinner?
- Sure. Any night this week.

745
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:21,765
OK. No, I'm sorry. This week's booked.

746
01:01:21,885 --> 01:01:26,145
- I'll check with my girl. I'll get back to you.
- You do that, Huckleberry.

747
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,975
I gotta run. You stop smoking, you hear?

748
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:30,935
I'll talk at ya.

749
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:35,655
Whoo! Oh!

750
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:49,835
It's in both our interests to put
a safe distance between you and us.

751
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:52,335
- You understand that, Mr Fox?
- Sure.

752
01:01:53,165 --> 01:01:57,135
This gives you limited power of attorney
for Mr Gekko's account.

753
01:01:57,135 --> 01:02:01,095
Every ticket you buy must be
marked "power of attorney".

754
01:02:01,095 --> 01:02:03,385
That means that you call the shots.

755
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:08,055
Mr Gekko has no official knowledge
of what stocks you're buying. All right?

756
01:02:08,185 --> 01:02:10,895
Just sign it at the end, twice.

757
01:02:11,935 --> 01:02:15,275
I never knew how poor I was
until I started making money.

758
01:02:15,275 --> 01:02:18,195
Your transactions will be
monitored by StockWatch.

759
01:02:18,695 --> 01:02:22,025
If any trouble does arise,
you are on your own out there.

760
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,445
The trail stops with you, understand?

761
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:28,495
Spread the buy orders over
different accounts, you won't get burnt.

762
01:02:28,615 --> 01:02:31,335
I have friends that won't
mind making easy money.

763
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:37,375
- Rudy Gazoodi! How's my cutie?! Viens ici!

764
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:39,005
We need more votes for the
showdown, but don't wanna go public...

765
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:41,515
We need more votes for the
showdown, but don't wanna go public...

766
01:02:41,605 --> 01:02:44,855
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.

767
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:48,275
Oh! He speaks French already.

768
01:02:48,405 --> 01:02:51,115
Kid had the highest score in his IQ test.

769
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:54,865
It is so difficult to get into
a good nursery school now.

770
01:02:57,455 --> 01:03:00,705
They even go to your home
to make sure you're acceptable.

771
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:03,415
That's it for you with the grown-ups.

772
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:06,835
- Nicole, would you take him for a nap now?
- Viens, mon petit.

773
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:10,385
Give him a bath and put that
cute little black suit on him.

774
01:03:10,505 --> 01:03:13,635
This is a contact at one of our offshore banks.

775
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:17,385
On settlement day you'll open
an account for Mr Gekko...

776
01:03:17,385 --> 01:03:19,975
...under the name Geneva Roth Holding Corp.

777
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:25,105
Then you'll wire-transfer the money
to this account in the Cayman Islands.

778
01:03:25,185 --> 01:03:27,815
You're gonna make a lot of money, pal.

779
01:03:28,525 --> 01:03:31,655
The stakes are going up. No mistakes.

780
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:35,115
Piece of cake, Gordon.

781
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:52,845
If I could have anything...

782
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:55,345
...this would almost do.

783
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,845
Almost.

784
01:03:59,095 --> 01:04:01,685
How'd your conference go with Gordon?

785
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:06,815
It went fine. We reached an agreement,
and decided to split up the world between us.

786
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:12,025
You have modest wants.
I like that in a man.

787
01:04:12,025 --> 01:04:15,575
- What do you want?
- Let's see.

788
01:04:15,575 --> 01:04:19,955
A Turner. A perfect canary diamond.

789
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:21,915
World peace.

790
01:04:22,035 --> 01:04:23,915
The best of everything.

791
01:04:23,995 --> 01:04:25,795
Well, why stop at that?

792
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,545
I don't.

793
01:04:43,185 --> 01:04:47,895
My client wants to buy a large block
of Teldar. He needs to spread it around.

794
01:04:47,895 --> 01:04:51,445
I'll park some money in your account.
If it hits, you get a big cut.

795
01:04:51,445 --> 01:04:55,405
I'm telling you, this is the easiest
money you've ever made.

796
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,905
All right, Bud.

797
01:04:57,985 --> 01:05:00,075
Let's do it.

798
01:05:00,405 --> 01:05:02,495
We go way back, Harry.

799
01:05:02,575 --> 01:05:06,955
You know, I-I-I've put a lot of money
into this firm over the years.

800
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:10,505
- I brought in a lot of business.
- You've taken enough out, too.

801
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:15,925
- You should have something put aside.
- With the divorces I haven't had a chance.

802
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:20,515
- The bridges are burned.
- When you fire me I'm finished. On the street.

803
01:05:20,635 --> 01:05:23,975
- How do you think I feel about this?
- How do you think I feel?

804
01:05:23,975 --> 01:05:26,895
I've got responsibilities. I've got two kids...

805
01:05:26,975 --> 01:05:29,065
What's going on?

806
01:05:29,185 --> 01:05:32,945
Lynch is giving him the boot.
Not pulling his quota.

807
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:36,905
We're all one trade away from humility.

808
01:05:36,985 --> 01:05:41,575
New report on GM and a conference call
in defence stock in my office, 7 am tomorrow.

809
01:05:41,695 --> 01:05:44,415
No RSVP required. Just be there.

810
01:05:45,035 --> 01:05:49,205
Now, on a more inspiring note,
the new office record...

811
01:05:49,205 --> 01:05:54,215
...for a single month's gross commission
from the wealthy individual accounts...

812
01:05:54,295 --> 01:05:58,255
...goes to Bud Fox.
Shows cold calling does work, fellas.

813
01:05:58,385 --> 01:06:01,305
Way to go, Bud. Superjob. Come on up here.

814
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:06,095
Bud, congrats. You just made my life
twice as hard around here.

815
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:15,985
You're on a roll, kid. Enjoy it
while it lasts, cos it never does.

816
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,825
Just kicking ass and taking names, Lou.

817
01:06:33,415 --> 01:06:35,925
Come along with me, Bud.

818
01:06:41,005 --> 01:06:43,095
This is yours now, Bud.

819
01:06:43,215 --> 01:06:45,725
Credenza. Tree. Windows.

820
01:06:45,805 --> 01:06:50,105
And, significantly more attractive,
your private secretary Janet.

821
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:52,895
- Nice to meet you, Mr Fox.
- Hello, Janet.

822
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:57,905
Well, I don't really know what to say.
Thank you, Mr Lynch.

823
01:06:58,025 --> 01:06:59,695
No, I thank you, Bud.

824
01:06:59,775 --> 01:07:03,865
The minute I laid my eyes on you
I knew that you had what it takes.

825
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:06,995
Now you can focus on the big-ticket retail.

826
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:10,955
Oh, this is very nice. This is very nice.

827
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:14,295
So what is it? Mr Cocksucker now?

828
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:20,005
Everybody hates the Upper East Side.
They wanna live on the West Side.

829
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:24,595
But when it's resale time
the East Side moves all the time.

830
01:07:24,715 --> 01:07:28,265
What have you got on the West Side?
Sean and Madonna?! Trust me.

831
01:07:28,555 --> 01:07:33,265
Massage, sauna, Jacuzzi... tanning salon.

832
01:07:34,815 --> 01:07:37,445
Best schools in the city.

833
01:07:37,525 --> 01:07:42,235
A cute young boy like you gotta think
of a future lady friend in your life...

834
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:44,945
...when you've finished wolfing around.

835
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:47,115
Course, I'm taken.

836
01:07:47,245 --> 01:07:49,325
Oak strip floors.

837
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:51,625
My husband can get you a 10% mortgage.

838
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:55,585
I would do it myself, except
I'm into four other deals right now.

839
01:07:56,085 --> 01:08:01,635
So, I got a four o'clock and a five. One's an
all-cash type. Monique something or other.

840
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:07,135
Look, maybe you'd like to see something
cheaper that I got on First Avenue?

841
01:08:07,265 --> 01:08:10,805
Honey, the meter's running. Anybody home?

842
01:08:12,265 --> 01:08:15,065
All right. Offer 950.

843
01:08:18,185 --> 01:08:20,695
I got something over on Sutton Place.

844
01:08:20,815 --> 01:08:24,445
It's a million and a half,
but now we're talking duplex.

845
01:08:24,575 --> 01:08:26,115
No.

846
01:08:26,325 --> 01:08:29,035
This is it. This is home.

847
01:08:58,355 --> 01:09:00,945
That's enough gold over there.

848
01:09:22,215 --> 01:09:24,295
Like it?

849
01:09:25,965 --> 01:09:31,515
I'm having House & Garden come up next
week to photograph it before it gets lived in.

850
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:32,635
Do you mind?

851
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:36,935
Hey! Jerry! Come at me. Whaddaya got?

852
01:09:37,015 --> 01:09:39,525
No, no. 37 1/2.

853
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:44,525
Convert the bonds and check the price
in Tokyo at eight o'clock your time. Right.

854
01:10:07,385 --> 01:10:09,675
I'm spilling everything.

855
01:10:40,955 --> 01:10:43,045
Isn't it perfect?

856
01:10:43,665 --> 01:10:45,755
It's too perfect.

857
01:10:46,045 --> 01:10:48,045
Let's not even eat.

858
01:10:48,135 --> 01:10:50,965
Let's just watch it... think about it.

859
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,685
Who am I?

860
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:52,905
Bud, come to bed.

861
01:11:57,995 --> 01:11:59,865
One million six. Seven.

862
01:11:59,995 --> 01:12:04,245
On my left now.
Against you, 1,800,000.

863
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:08,125
1,900,000. New bidder this side.
$2m here now.

864
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:11,965
Not yours. At $2,100,000. $2,100,000.

865
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:15,425
Fair warning, then.
Selling for $2,100,000. All done.

866
01:12:15,515 --> 01:12:17,925
For you, sir. $2,100,000.

867
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:21,475
Whaddaya say we get a suite at the Carlyle?

868
01:12:21,555 --> 01:12:25,435
Champagne, caviar...?
Celebrate just like old times?

869
01:12:25,525 --> 01:12:28,435
Come on, Gordon. Those days are over.

870
01:12:28,565 --> 01:12:31,485
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

871
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:34,905
You're as beautiful as
that painting I just bought.

872
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:40,745
Sunshine, what's wrong?
I think you got a bad case of puppy love.

873
01:12:40,865 --> 01:12:43,245
I think I'm falling for Bud.

874
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:47,415
Don't fall too far. He hasn't been
around the block yet. You have.

875
01:12:48,795 --> 01:12:52,755
- Told him about us?
- No! Are you crazy?

876
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:57,135
- I don't want him to ever know, understand?
- Mum is the word.

877
01:12:59,225 --> 01:13:01,385
You and I are the same, Darien.

878
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:06,105
We are smart enough not to buy
into the oldest myth running-love.

879
01:13:06,725 --> 01:13:11,315
Fiction created by people to keep
them from jumping out of windows.

880
01:13:11,315 --> 01:13:16,195
You know, sometimes I miss you, Gordon.
You're really twisted.

881
01:13:18,825 --> 01:13:20,905
For chrissake, Jack, it's easy!

882
01:13:20,995 --> 01:13:25,165
On settlement day you endorse a cheque
to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company.

883
01:13:25,285 --> 01:13:27,375
Then I'll send you your cut.

884
01:13:28,205 --> 01:13:31,965
What? No, that's the bottom line.
Nobody gets hurt.

885
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:34,545
What the fuck is wrong with you?

886
01:13:34,675 --> 01:13:39,135
It's so bad, even the liars are complaining.
But not you. You're making big money.

887
01:13:39,265 --> 01:13:41,425
- What's the bottom line?
- Hey, look!

888
01:13:41,555 --> 01:13:45,605
I am sick and tired of playing
wet nurse to you!

889
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:50,735
- Will you do your own homework, Marv!
- What an asshole, man!

890
01:13:51,355 --> 01:13:53,445
That's a shame.

891
01:13:56,155 --> 01:14:01,365
Yeah, Frank. Work 500,000 shares Teldar
with a limit of 26. New account.

892
01:14:01,445 --> 01:14:03,535
Don't fuck it up.

893
01:14:05,205 --> 01:14:07,415
- How's Teldar doing?
- Back again?

894
01:14:07,415 --> 01:14:11,375
- I've got a real appetite.
- Bring it five to a half. 2,000 up.

895
01:14:11,455 --> 01:14:15,545
- I gotta buy stock. What's offered at a half?
- What are we looking at?

896
01:14:15,635 --> 01:14:18,135
- Make me an offer on 80.
- 80,000 at a half.

897
01:14:18,255 --> 01:14:19,925
I'll take it.

898
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:49,745
Your company, ladies and gentlemen,
is under siege from Gordon Gekko.

899
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:55,045
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt,
like some piss-poor South American country!

900
01:14:55,375 --> 01:15:01,005
I strongly recommend you to see through
Mr Gekko's shameless intention here...

901
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:05,805
...to strip this company,
and severely penalise the stockholders.

902
01:15:05,885 --> 01:15:09,015
I strongly recommend you
to reject his tender...

903
01:15:09,355 --> 01:15:14,435
...by voting for management's
restructuring of the stock.

904
01:15:23,325 --> 01:15:27,285
Well, I appreciate the opportunity
you're giving me, Mr Cromwell...

905
01:15:27,365 --> 01:15:31,455
...as the single largest shareholder
in Teldar Paper, to speak.

906
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:39,795
We are not here to indulge in fantasy,
but in political and economic reality.

907
01:15:40,845 --> 01:15:46,345
America... America
has become a second-rate power.

908
01:15:47,725 --> 01:15:53,225
Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit
are at nightmare proportions.

909
01:15:54,475 --> 01:15:58,855
In the days of the free market, when
our country was a top industrial power...

910
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:02,405
...there was accountability to the stockholder.

911
01:16:02,945 --> 01:16:08,575
The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men
that built this great empire, made sure of it...

912
01:16:08,655 --> 01:16:11,285
...because it was their money at stake.

913
01:16:11,495 --> 01:16:15,545
Today, management
has no stake in the company!

914
01:16:16,915 --> 01:16:22,005
All together, these men sitting up here
own less than 3% of the company.

915
01:16:22,135 --> 01:16:26,095
And where does Mr Cromwell
put his $1,000,000 salary?

916
01:16:26,095 --> 01:16:29,845
Not in Teldar stock. He owns less than 1%.

917
01:16:29,935 --> 01:16:34,015
You own the company.
That's right, you, the stockholder.

918
01:16:34,105 --> 01:16:38,485
And you are all being royally
screwed over by these bureaucrats...

919
01:16:38,605 --> 01:16:44,655
...with their steak lunches, their fishing trips,
their corporate jets and golden parachutes.

920
01:16:44,655 --> 01:16:47,245
This is an outrage! You're out of line, Gekko!

921
01:16:47,365 --> 01:16:53,205
Teldar Paper, Mr Cromwell,
has 33 different vice presidents...

922
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:57,795
...each earning over $200,000 a year.

923
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:04,675
Now, I have spent the last two months
analysing what all these guys do.

924
01:17:05,295 --> 01:17:08,015
- And I still can't figure it out.

925
01:17:08,095 --> 01:17:14,055
One thing I do know is that
our paper company lost $110m last year.

926
01:17:14,145 --> 01:17:19,895
And I'll bet half of that was spent in all the
paperwork between all these vice presidents!

927
01:17:21,985 --> 01:17:25,525
The new law of evolution
in corporate America...

928
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:29,575
...seems to be... survival of the unfittest.

929
01:17:30,825 --> 01:17:34,995
Well, in my book you either do it right,
or you get eliminated.

930
01:17:37,415 --> 01:17:42,715
In the last seven deals that I have been
involved with there were 2.5m stockholders...

931
01:17:42,835 --> 01:17:47,305
...who have made a pre-tax profit
of $12 billion.

932
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:49,715
Thank you.

933
01:17:51,885 --> 01:17:55,145
I am not a destroyer of companies.

934
01:17:55,225 --> 01:17:57,725
I am a liberator of them!

935
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:06,405
The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
that greed, for lack of a better word...

936
01:18:06,485 --> 01:18:08,365
...is good.

937
01:18:08,485 --> 01:18:11,695
Greed is right. Greed works.

938
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:19,415
Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures
the essence of the evolutionary spirit.

939
01:18:19,545 --> 01:18:26,635
Greed, in all of its forms-greed for life,
for money, for love, knowledge -

940
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:29,425
...has marked the upward surge of mankind.

941
01:18:29,555 --> 01:18:36,225
And greed, you mark my words,
will not only save Teldar Paper...

942
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:40,395
...but that other malfunctioning
corporation called the USA.

943
01:18:40,475 --> 01:18:42,775
Thank you very much.

944
01:18:58,325 --> 01:19:00,495
Buy me 20 June eurodollar CDs...

945
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:05,625
...20 March gold and sell 10 September
Deutschmarks. Right. Talk at ya, babe.

946
01:19:07,085 --> 01:19:12,595
Ah, Buddy, Buddy, I hate to tell you this,
but you are a genius!

947
01:19:13,135 --> 01:19:15,435
Darien! Lightning has struck.

948
01:19:15,515 --> 01:19:19,055
The light bulb has been invented.
Bluestar Airlines.

949
01:19:19,185 --> 01:19:22,315
Edison, da Vinci, Einstein.
They're all watching me.

950
01:19:22,395 --> 01:19:24,605
Ever hear of the 60-hour work week?

951
01:19:24,685 --> 01:19:28,865
You've gotta go to work soon. I'm getting
psychotic from a lack of REM sleep.

952
01:19:28,985 --> 01:19:31,275
I'm not gonna broker the rest of my life.

953
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:36,575
I am gonna be a giant, an entrepreneur
in the Italian 16th-century sense of the word.

954
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:40,665
A mover, a shaker.
I'm shooting for the stars, Darien.

955
01:19:40,665 --> 01:19:43,245
You're coming along for the ride.

956
01:19:45,545 --> 01:19:48,675
Bluestar is an unpolished gem, Gordon.

957
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:53,055
A half-assed management being decimated
by a price war they cannot win.

958
01:19:53,175 --> 01:19:56,305
But the gates at La Guardia alone
can bail us out.

959
01:19:56,385 --> 01:20:00,685
If it's worth a dime, it's worth 10 bucks
a share. They're ripe to fall!

960
01:20:00,685 --> 01:20:02,645
Mixed emotions, Buddy.

961
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:07,775
Like Larry Wildman going off
a cliff... in my new Maserati!

962
01:20:09,315 --> 01:20:12,865
Guys like me have had their asses hung
in a sling with the airlines!

963
01:20:12,985 --> 01:20:17,655
- Fuel could go up. Unions are killers.
- Yeah, but aren't you forgetting one thing?

964
01:20:17,785 --> 01:20:22,995
Capital reserves. This company has
75 million cash in an overfunded pension.

965
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:25,295
That buys us a lot of credibility.

966
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:28,835
And the beauty is, you already
own close to 2% of this sucker.

967
01:20:28,835 --> 01:20:33,715
The insurance people are balking on the
logging trucks. What do you want to do?

968
01:20:33,845 --> 01:20:37,675
Tell those assholes
we'll self-insure if they don't write it.

969
01:20:37,805 --> 01:20:42,055
I can't believe we can fire half
the management and nothing changes!

970
01:20:44,895 --> 01:20:49,485
Gordon, what I want,
and I've never asked you for anything...

971
01:20:49,565 --> 01:20:52,275
...is to be your copilot on this one.

972
01:20:52,905 --> 01:20:58,035
I wanna take this airline, turn it around and
make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune.

973
01:21:00,745 --> 01:21:06,165
I got a stockbroker who wants an airline. It'll
take two years to turn Teldar Paper around.

974
01:21:06,165 --> 01:21:10,545
What do I need a dink airline for? I'm up
to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake!

975
01:21:10,755 --> 01:21:15,005
I've worked at Bluestar. I know my way
around. I have friends there, inside.

976
01:21:15,635 --> 01:21:17,715
What do you mean?

977
01:21:17,845 --> 01:21:22,305
The three unions.
It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget.

978
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:27,525
The hourly cost of a flight crew is 850
an hour. That's the real hidden value, GG.

979
01:21:27,645 --> 01:21:32,025
If you can negotiate that out,
get a crew down to 350, 400 an hour...

980
01:21:32,105 --> 01:21:35,235
...this airline'll be the hottest thing
since Texas Air.

981
01:21:35,365 --> 01:21:40,155
- What makes you think you can?
- I can talk to these people. They trust me.

982
01:21:40,245 --> 01:21:43,165
My father can be a big help in getting cuts.

983
01:21:49,755 --> 01:21:54,005
All right. Susan, get Buckingham
on the phone. Tell him to look into it.

984
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:57,345
So the falcon's heard the falconer, huh?

985
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:14,565
- Hi, Dad.
- Sorry I'm late.

986
01:22:14,655 --> 01:22:17,275
That's OK. Overdressed as usual.

987
01:22:18,945 --> 01:22:23,325
Come on in. Everybody's here.
I couldn't start the show without you.

988
01:22:24,785 --> 01:22:26,955
Well, I'll be a lousy Republican!

989
01:22:27,085 --> 01:22:31,255
I decorate for Democrats, too.
Lots of them. I'm Darien Taylor.

990
01:22:31,335 --> 01:22:34,375
- Bud's told me all about you.
- Don't believe a word.

991
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:36,885
I never beat him or locked him in a closet.

992
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:39,595
- I forgot about the closet.
- He turned out OK.

993
01:22:39,675 --> 01:22:42,725
Bud's a born liar, otherwise he's a good kid.

994
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:46,555
I hope you come here more often,
under less formal circumstances.

995
01:22:46,685 --> 01:22:48,225
Thank you.

996
01:22:48,355 --> 01:22:51,275
- Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore.
- Sure. How are ya?

997
01:22:51,355 --> 01:22:54,895
Pilots' union.
Toni Carpenter, flight attendants'.

998
01:22:55,025 --> 01:22:57,115
I'd like you to meet Mr Gekko.

999
01:22:57,195 --> 01:22:59,405
Mr Fox, pleasure to meet you.

1000
01:22:59,615 --> 01:23:01,695
His attorney, Mr Salt.

1001
01:23:01,785 --> 01:23:05,245
I'd be proud to have a son like Buddy.
Got a hell of a career in front of him.

1002
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:10,245
I'm glad you think so. I thought this was
informal. What's your attorney doing here?

1003
01:23:10,245 --> 01:23:13,795
Harold, you don't mind walking
around the block, do you?

1004
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:16,505
- Of course.
- I'll take that.

1005
01:23:16,505 --> 01:23:18,255
No offence.

1006
01:23:18,385 --> 01:23:20,465
None taken.

1007
01:23:25,265 --> 01:23:27,975
That's OK, Gordon. Bud does it all the time.

1008
01:23:29,645 --> 01:23:35,355
Look, I got no illusions about
winning a popularity contest with any of you.

1009
01:23:35,985 --> 01:23:37,985
I got roasted the other night.

1010
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:43,195
A friend asked "Why are we honouring this
man? Did we run out of human beings?"

1011
01:23:44,035 --> 01:23:48,075
It's not always the most popular guy
who gets the job done.

1012
01:23:51,335 --> 01:23:54,955
You've got losses of $20-30 million,
dividends cut to zero...

1013
01:23:55,085 --> 01:23:58,005
...and you're being squeezed
to death by the majors.

1014
01:23:58,085 --> 01:24:04,055
The management may not be the worst scum,
but they put you on this kamikaze course...

1015
01:24:04,135 --> 01:24:08,725
...and pretty soon everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes.

1016
01:24:08,845 --> 01:24:11,355
Only there's not enough to go around.

1017
01:24:11,435 --> 01:24:14,355
Management has them. You don't.

1018
01:24:16,355 --> 01:24:19,905
If they throw Bluestar to Chapter 11,
which I think they will...

1019
01:24:19,985 --> 01:24:25,615
...they'll use the bankruptcy laws to break
your unions, and throw you off the property.

1020
01:24:25,745 --> 01:24:30,745
Oh, come on! With all due respect, what's
to prevent you from doing the same thing?

1021
01:24:30,745 --> 01:24:33,035
Cos I got a way around all this...

1022
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:37,625
...where we can all make money
and make the airline profitable.

1023
01:24:38,045 --> 01:24:40,755
So what do you say we cut to the chase?

1024
01:24:42,005 --> 01:24:48,685
I'm asking for a modest 20% across-the-board
wage cut, and seven more hours a month.

1025
01:24:50,015 --> 01:24:52,305
What kind of time frame?

1026
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:55,775
A year. If we're still losing money,
the reduction stands.

1027
01:24:55,855 --> 01:25:00,775
If we're in the black, I'll return part of the
givebacks, pay goes back to current levels...

1028
01:25:00,855 --> 01:25:06,825
...and we initiate an employee
profit-sharing programme with stock.

1029
01:25:06,905 --> 01:25:10,575
- You'll own part of the airline.
- Will you put it in writing?

1030
01:25:10,665 --> 01:25:14,125
I'll have a letter of agreement
drafted up in two days.

1031
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:18,375
What's your marketing strategy?
How will you return us to profitability?

1032
01:25:18,505 --> 01:25:21,835
Why don't I give Buddy an opportunity
to answer that? Buddy?

1033
01:25:21,925 --> 01:25:24,135
Thank you, Gordon.

1034
01:25:24,135 --> 01:25:27,885
First, I want you all to know
that my door will always be open...

1035
01:25:27,885 --> 01:25:32,055
...because I know from my dad
it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying.

1036
01:25:32,145 --> 01:25:36,015
What I've come up with here
is a basic three-point plan.

1037
01:25:36,015 --> 01:25:40,605
One: we modernise. Our computer
software is dogshit. We update it.

1038
01:25:40,695 --> 01:25:43,525
We squeeze every dollar
out of each mile flown.

1039
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:47,365
Don't sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when he's willing to pay 379.

1040
01:25:47,485 --> 01:25:53,745
Effective inventory management
will increase our load factor by 5-20%.

1041
01:25:53,745 --> 01:25:57,995
That translates to approximately
$50-200 million in revenues.

1042
01:25:58,335 --> 01:26:01,545
The point being,
we can beat the majors at a price war.

1043
01:26:01,665 --> 01:26:05,925
Two: advertising. More, and aggressive.
We attack the majors.

1044
01:26:06,045 --> 01:26:10,515
Three: expansion. We expand our hubs
to Atlanta, North Carolina and St Louis.

1045
01:26:10,635 --> 01:26:13,635
And we reorganise all
of our feeder schedules.

1046
01:26:13,765 --> 01:26:17,515
We gotta think big, guys.
We're going after the majors.

1047
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:23,025
Well, cards on the table, guys.
What do you say?

1048
01:26:23,145 --> 01:26:27,615
Well, if you mean what you say,
I think we're probably in the ballpark.

1049
01:26:27,735 --> 01:26:31,075
- I guess I can take it to my people.
- Good.

1050
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:34,825
You've sketched broad strokes.
I'd like to see the fine print.

1051
01:26:34,915 --> 01:26:37,125
But I like what I hear so far.

1052
01:26:42,005 --> 01:26:47,845
I guess if a man lives long enough he gets
to see everything, and I do mean everything.

1053
01:26:47,965 --> 01:26:51,595
What else you got
in your bag of tricks, Mr Gekko?

1054
01:26:52,845 --> 01:26:58,895
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more,
but, if you have any suggestions, I'll listen.

1055
01:26:59,015 --> 01:27:02,145
"There came into Egypt
a Pharaoh who did not know."

1056
01:27:02,145 --> 01:27:06,105
- I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
- No, a prophecy.

1057
01:27:06,195 --> 01:27:09,235
The rich have been doing it
to the poor since time began.

1058
01:27:09,325 --> 01:27:13,495
The only difference is
the Egyptians didn't allow unions.

1059
01:27:13,615 --> 01:27:15,995
I know what this guy's all about-greed.

1060
01:27:16,115 --> 01:27:21,125
He don't care about Bluestar or the unions.
He's in for the buck. He don't take prisoners.

1061
01:27:21,415 --> 01:27:22,795
Wait a minute, Dad.

1062
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:26,835
Sure. What's worth doing
is worth doing for money.

1063
01:27:26,965 --> 01:27:31,965
It's a bad bargain if nobody gains.
And if we do this deal, everybody gains.

1064
01:27:32,055 --> 01:27:36,765
Course, my son worked as a baggage handler
and freight loader for three summers.

1065
01:27:36,845 --> 01:27:40,105
With those qualifications,
he can run an airline!

1066
01:27:40,395 --> 01:27:42,895
Fine. Stay with the present management...

1067
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:46,645
...dedicated to running you and
your airline into the ground.

1068
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:52,485
That "scum" built the company up with one
plane and made something out of nothing.

1069
01:27:52,615 --> 01:27:58,455
If that's a scum, I'll take it over a rat any day.
You know where I stand. Good night, all.

1070
01:28:04,705 --> 01:28:06,795
Excuse me.

1071
01:28:09,795 --> 01:28:15,015
Congratulations, Dad! You did a great job
embarrassing me, not to mention yourself!

1072
01:28:15,345 --> 01:28:19,095
Save the "workers unite" speech.
I heard it too much growing up!

1073
01:28:19,095 --> 01:28:22,435
- Oh, yeah?
- You'll get axed. No two ways about it.

1074
01:28:22,435 --> 01:28:26,065
You and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes!

1075
01:28:26,185 --> 01:28:29,605
And if it isn't Gekko,
it's gonna be some other killer!

1076
01:28:34,945 --> 01:28:40,165
He's using you, kid. He's got your prick
in his pocket, but you're too blind to see it.

1077
01:28:40,245 --> 01:28:42,875
No. I see a jealous old machinist...

1078
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:46,835
...who can't stand the fact that his son's
more successful than he is!

1079
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:52,465
What you see is a guy who never measured
a man's success by the size of his wallet!

1080
01:28:52,545 --> 01:28:58,095
That's because you never had the guts to go
out into the world and stake your own claim!

1081
01:29:06,855 --> 01:29:11,855
Boy, if that's the way you feel,
I must've done a really lousy job as a father.

1082
01:29:16,535 --> 01:29:18,825
As far as being axed, I'm still around...

1083
01:29:18,955 --> 01:29:22,495
...and I have a responsibility
to the union membership I represent.

1084
01:29:22,575 --> 01:29:26,665
Your responsibility is to present the facts,
not opinions, to your men.

1085
01:29:26,745 --> 01:29:30,005
You'll destroy their lives.
Let them decide for themselves.

1086
01:29:30,085 --> 01:29:34,465
My men will want to know what's
going on, and I won't lie to them!

1087
01:29:34,595 --> 01:29:37,385
Oh, yeah, your men! Your fuckin' men!

1088
01:29:37,515 --> 01:29:40,725
All my life your men have
been able to count on you!

1089
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:43,555
Why have you never been there for me?!

1090
01:29:44,395 --> 01:29:46,265
What if you're wrong?

1091
01:29:46,265 --> 01:29:52,195
What if one day the sun didn't rise in the
east, and for once your compass was off?

1092
01:29:52,315 --> 01:29:55,865
Would you be willing to wreck
your men's future? My future?

1093
01:29:55,945 --> 01:30:01,285
Dad, think for a change. Be practical.
I'm asking you. I'm fuckin' begging you!

1094
01:30:02,535 --> 01:30:05,955
I don't go to sleep with no whore
and I don't wake up with no whore.

1095
01:30:06,085 --> 01:30:09,915
That's how I live with myself.
I don't know how you do it.

1096
01:30:10,045 --> 01:30:15,045
I hope I'm wrong about this guy...
but I'll let the men decide for themselves.

1097
01:30:15,135 --> 01:30:17,425
That much I promise you.

1098
01:30:43,495 --> 01:30:47,665
You should look at this, Chief.
A guy at Jackson Steinem...

1099
01:30:47,785 --> 01:30:52,465
...buying large chunks of Teldar Paper
for an offshore account.

1100
01:30:57,465 --> 01:30:59,675
So, what's the problema?

1101
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:02,885
- Do you know what the fuck the problem is?
- What?

1102
01:31:03,515 --> 01:31:06,145
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

1103
01:31:06,145 --> 01:31:09,975
I get a strange call from the SEC.
They asked to see my records.

1104
01:31:10,105 --> 01:31:13,855
- This is heavy, Bud.
- Hey, hey, hey, relax! Relax, Roger.

1105
01:31:15,105 --> 01:31:18,235
You're 82M in the account numbers
and I'm the invisible man.

1106
01:31:18,235 --> 01:31:20,535
Well, that's good for you, Bud.

1107
01:31:20,615 --> 01:31:25,325
They're always looking for red flags.
Gekko's always getting checked by 'em.

1108
01:31:25,415 --> 01:31:28,125
They never come up with anything, Rog.

1109
01:31:29,995 --> 01:31:33,455
Hey... we're invulnerable on this one.

1110
01:31:34,295 --> 01:31:37,085
I just wanna slow down, Bud.

1111
01:31:37,215 --> 01:31:38,675
All right?

1112
01:31:38,755 --> 01:31:43,885
No more lunches, no calls, all right?
We suspend our business, all right?

1113
01:31:43,975 --> 01:31:46,685
Whatever you want, Rog. It's cool.

1114
01:31:47,015 --> 01:31:50,565
Excuse me. Hey, Rog, can you come
back in? Bring the cost report.

1115
01:31:50,565 --> 01:31:52,645
We're starting again.

1116
01:31:54,735 --> 01:31:58,905
Gekko's asked us into the Bluestar deal.
We're reviewing timetables.

1117
01:31:58,985 --> 01:32:02,735
- You wanna come?
- He didn't tell me about that.

1118
01:32:02,865 --> 01:32:08,495
You're only the president of the company.
What the hell do you know anyway, right?

1119
01:32:18,505 --> 01:32:21,295
Guys, new chief of Bluestar - Bud Fox.

1120
01:32:21,425 --> 01:32:23,305
- Hi.
- Hello, Bud.

1121
01:32:23,305 --> 01:32:26,305
Guys, what's the problem? It's time to kill.

1122
01:32:27,135 --> 01:32:31,935
Gekko's got 12% of the stock and climbing.
Plus he's got the unions in his back pocket.

1123
01:32:32,065 --> 01:32:36,645
Everybody knows the stock's in play.
By next week the street will own Bluestar.

1124
01:32:36,735 --> 01:32:38,815
Is the bank financing in place?

1125
01:32:39,025 --> 01:32:43,735
Or are we gonna sit around and have
more of these ridiculous meetings?

1126
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:49,035
Our firm committed weeks ago 25%
of the total long-term debt structure.

1127
01:32:49,245 --> 01:32:52,915
Unless you guys sign
this piece of paper right now...

1128
01:32:52,995 --> 01:32:56,455
...l'm gonna pull and go to
another bank for the 75.

1129
01:32:57,085 --> 01:33:03,345
Look, we've got 30 banks ready to participate
in a four-year revolving credit line.

1130
01:33:03,425 --> 01:33:10,305
We must have your assurance you will pay
back most of the loan in the first 12 months.

1131
01:33:10,845 --> 01:33:16,355
The only way we can see this happening
is liquidating the hangars and the planes.

1132
01:33:16,475 --> 01:33:20,315
Can you people guarantee
the liquidation of Bluestar?

1133
01:33:20,445 --> 01:33:22,525
Guarantee? No sweat!

1134
01:33:22,615 --> 01:33:26,485
We got the Bleezburgs lined up
to build condos where the hangars are.

1135
01:33:26,575 --> 01:33:30,535
We lay the airplanes off to the Mexicans,
who are dumb enough to buy 'em!

1136
01:33:30,665 --> 01:33:34,835
And I got the Texas boys drooling
at my kneecaps for the routes and slots.

1137
01:33:34,835 --> 01:33:37,415
What's your problem? It's done!

1138
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:41,295
Here's the price tags
on the 737s, gates, hangars, routes.

1139
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:44,635
We got it nailed right down
to the typewriters.

1140
01:33:44,635 --> 01:33:47,765
The beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension.

1141
01:33:47,765 --> 01:33:51,185
Gekko makes $75m there.

1142
01:33:51,515 --> 01:33:55,975
50 million buys him the minimum
annuities for 6,000 employees...

1143
01:33:56,105 --> 01:34:03,275
...and he walks away with the rest.
I figure he'll make... He'll clear $60-70m.

1144
01:34:03,405 --> 01:34:05,905
Not bad for a month's work.

1145
01:34:07,155 --> 01:34:09,865
Your boy really did his homework, Fox.

1146
01:34:09,865 --> 01:34:15,165
And you'll have the shortest executive
career since that Pope that got poisoned.

1147
01:34:15,285 --> 01:34:19,545
Now he'll really start believing
he's Gekko the Great.

1148
01:34:20,915 --> 01:34:23,925
- He'd like to change that appointment.
- Hold this.

1149
01:34:24,045 --> 01:34:26,425
Bud, you can't go in! He's in a meeting!

1150
01:34:26,545 --> 01:34:30,095
Alex has come up with
an ingenious way for us to...

1151
01:34:31,635 --> 01:34:34,345
I didn't know we had a meeting today, sport.

1152
01:34:34,475 --> 01:34:37,605
I didn't, either.
I think we should talk, Gordon.

1153
01:34:38,855 --> 01:34:43,855
- Would you excuse us for a second?
- Won't you come this way, gentlemen?

1154
01:34:43,945 --> 01:34:46,025
Thank you, Alex.

1155
01:34:48,235 --> 01:34:49,695
What do you want?

1156
01:34:49,785 --> 01:34:52,905
I just found out about
the garage sale at Bluestar.

1157
01:34:53,035 --> 01:34:56,875
Why?!

1158
01:34:56,995 --> 01:35:00,755
Last night I was reading Rudy
Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Pot.

1159
01:35:00,755 --> 01:35:06,585
You know what happened? He stuck his nose
in the pot once too often, and he got stuck.

1160
01:35:07,295 --> 01:35:09,715
Maybe you oughta read him Pinocchio.

1161
01:35:09,805 --> 01:35:14,305
I thought you were gonna turn
Bluestar around, not upside down!

1162
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:18,555
- You fuckin' used me!
- You're walking around blind without a cane.

1163
01:35:18,685 --> 01:35:21,475
A fool and his money are lucky to even meet.

1164
01:35:21,605 --> 01:35:26,405
- Why do you need to wreck this company?
- Because it's wreckable, all right?!

1165
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:29,405
I took another look. I changed my mind.

1166
01:35:29,525 --> 01:35:32,445
If they lose their jobs,
they got nowhere to go!

1167
01:35:32,535 --> 01:35:36,205
My father has worked there for 24 years!
I gave him my word!

1168
01:35:36,285 --> 01:35:38,785
It's all about bucks, kid.

1169
01:35:39,335 --> 01:35:41,835
The rest is conversation.

1170
01:35:41,915 --> 01:35:44,215
Buddy, you'll still be president.

1171
01:35:44,335 --> 01:35:47,675
When the time comes,
you'll parachute out a rich man.

1172
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:51,715
With the money you'll make,
your dad's never got to work again.

1173
01:35:52,555 --> 01:35:56,015
So tell me, Gordon,
when does it all end, huh?

1174
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:59,435
How many yachts can you water-ski behind?
How much is enough?

1175
01:35:59,555 --> 01:36:03,105
It's not a question of enough, pal.
It's a zero-sum game.

1176
01:36:03,185 --> 01:36:06,025
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

1177
01:36:06,105 --> 01:36:10,065
Money itself isn't lost or made,
it's simply transferred...

1178
01:36:10,195 --> 01:36:13,745
...from one perception to another, like magic.

1179
01:36:14,655 --> 01:36:18,615
This painting here.
I bought it ten years ago for $60,000.

1180
01:36:18,745 --> 01:36:23,205
I could sell it today for six hundred.
The illusion has become real.

1181
01:36:23,335 --> 01:36:27,505
And the more real it becomes,
the more desperate they want it.

1182
01:36:28,545 --> 01:36:31,045
Capitalism at its finest.

1183
01:36:31,545 --> 01:36:34,055
How much is enough, Gordon?

1184
01:36:36,555 --> 01:36:42,935
The richest 1% of this country owns half
our country's wealth. Five trillion dollars.

1185
01:36:43,015 --> 01:36:47,105
One third comes from hard work,
two thirds from inheritance...

1186
01:36:47,105 --> 01:36:50,865
...interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons...

1187
01:36:50,865 --> 01:36:54,405
...and what I do:
stock and real-estate speculation.

1188
01:36:55,115 --> 01:36:56,785
It's bullshit.

1189
01:36:56,905 --> 01:37:01,165
You got 90% of the American public
with little or no net worth.

1190
01:37:01,285 --> 01:37:03,375
I create nothing.

1191
01:37:04,295 --> 01:37:06,375
I own.

1192
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:09,005
We make the rules, pal.

1193
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:13,885
The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval,
the price of a paperclip.

1194
01:37:14,005 --> 01:37:19,015
We pick that rabbit out of the hat while
everybody wonders how the hell we did it.

1195
01:37:20,055 --> 01:37:24,855
You're not naive enough to think we're
living in a democracy, are you, Buddy?

1196
01:37:24,935 --> 01:37:28,815
It's the free market, and you're part of it.

1197
01:37:29,945 --> 01:37:32,865
Yeah. You got that killer instinct.

1198
01:37:34,945 --> 01:37:37,865
Stick around, pal.
I still got a lot to teach you.

1199
01:37:37,995 --> 01:37:39,865
Obviously.

1200
01:37:39,865 --> 01:37:42,995
Oh, Buddy, come on.
I was gonna tell you about it.

1201
01:37:43,075 --> 01:37:46,625
Calm down, all right?
We'll have dinner tonight. Bring Darien.

1202
01:37:46,745 --> 01:37:48,505
No, I can't make it tonight.

1203
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:50,925
Hey, Buddy.

1204
01:37:50,925 --> 01:37:53,425
Are you with me?

1205
01:37:54,135 --> 01:37:57,055
I need to know if you're with me.

1206
01:37:58,425 --> 01:38:00,725
I'm with you, Gordon.

1207
01:38:04,685 --> 01:38:07,815
- Natalie, I'll be right there.
- Yes, Mr Gekko.

1208
01:38:15,735 --> 01:38:18,235
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Ollie.

1209
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:21,785
Tell them I want ziplocked mouths
on the Bluestar deal...

1210
01:38:21,865 --> 01:38:25,535
...or I'll come down there
and rip out their fuckin' throats.

1211
01:39:08,285 --> 01:39:10,165
Bud?

1212
01:39:12,335 --> 01:39:14,425
What's going on?

1213
01:39:19,345 --> 01:39:24,135
I've been played like a grand piano
by the master, Gekko the Great.

1214
01:39:25,475 --> 01:39:27,975
Today was the big crash...

1215
01:39:28,605 --> 01:39:31,225
...the liquidation sale.

1216
01:39:31,225 --> 01:39:36,105
He's gonna carve Bluestar
into little pieces and sell it all off.

1217
01:39:36,235 --> 01:39:38,405
Bastard!

1218
01:39:38,525 --> 01:39:40,615
I'm sorry.

1219
01:39:41,035 --> 01:39:44,035
I was afraid something
like this could happen.

1220
01:39:44,155 --> 01:39:47,705
I handed it to him on a silver platter.
I told my father...

1221
01:39:47,785 --> 01:39:51,045
Bud! Bud, it's not your fault.

1222
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:53,545
And it's not your decision.

1223
01:39:53,545 --> 01:39:56,545
I'm not gonna let it happen.

1224
01:39:56,675 --> 01:39:59,595
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.

1225
01:40:00,845 --> 01:40:06,475
If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar, someone else
will. Who's to say they won't do the same?

1226
01:40:07,095 --> 01:40:10,105
At least I won't be pulling the trigger.

1227
01:40:11,685 --> 01:40:17,195
Why are you doing this?
You've worked hard to get where you are.

1228
01:40:17,315 --> 01:40:20,945
We're so close.
You don't wanna throw it all away.

1229
01:40:21,695 --> 01:40:25,035
Look, I can stay with the firm,
and you're doing fine.

1230
01:40:25,035 --> 01:40:27,955
We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

1231
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:38,795
I'm not looking to just survive.

1232
01:40:38,885 --> 01:40:41,795
I've been doing that all my life.

1233
01:40:41,925 --> 01:40:44,845
Cut this self-pity crap, Bud!

1234
01:40:44,925 --> 01:40:47,845
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

1235
01:40:49,095 --> 01:40:54,935
It means if you make an enemy of Gordon
Gekko, I can't be there to stand by you.

1236
01:40:56,315 --> 01:40:59,315
Oh, yeah? Do you really mean that?

1237
01:41:00,485 --> 01:41:03,695
What did he promise you?
To take you public?

1238
01:41:05,075 --> 01:41:10,705
Without his money and seal of approval
I'm not such a hot investment any more.

1239
01:41:10,785 --> 01:41:15,505
- You're just the best money can buy, Darien.
- You're not exactly pure, Bud.

1240
01:41:16,005 --> 01:41:20,085
You went after Gekko and me with
the same vengeance. Look in the mirror.

1241
01:41:20,175 --> 01:41:23,505
I'm looking, and I sure don't like what I see.

1242
01:41:25,515 --> 01:41:29,475
Fair enough. But it's not that simple, Bud.

1243
01:41:30,805 --> 01:41:34,475
When I was down and had nothing,
it was Gordon who helped me.

1244
01:41:34,475 --> 01:41:40,525
He got me all my clients-you among them -
and he can take them away from me like that.

1245
01:41:41,565 --> 01:41:44,905
You may find out that when
you've had money and lost it...

1246
01:41:44,985 --> 01:41:48,445
...it's worse than never having had it at all.
- Oh, yeah?

1247
01:41:48,535 --> 01:41:50,615
That is bullshit!

1248
01:41:52,915 --> 01:41:54,995
Hey! Hey!

1249
01:41:55,545 --> 01:41:59,085
You step out that door
and I am changing the locks!

1250
01:42:02,505 --> 01:42:07,305
You may not believe this, Bud,
but I really do care for you.

1251
01:42:08,345 --> 01:42:11,265
We would've made a good team.

1252
01:42:11,385 --> 01:42:13,685
I'm sorry.

1253
01:42:14,185 --> 01:42:16,605
Get the fuck outta here!

1254
01:42:31,405 --> 01:42:35,375
The market is dead right now.
Even the rich are bitching.

1255
01:42:35,455 --> 01:42:39,755
The only thing moving is the termites
and cockroaches, and my commission...

1256
01:42:39,835 --> 01:42:43,925
Look, save the rap, all right?
Just sell the fucker, fast!

1257
01:42:51,845 --> 01:42:54,345
There he is.
Where you been the last two days?

1258
01:42:54,345 --> 01:42:59,565
- Janet, get my father on the phone and...
- Your mom's been calling. Your father's...

1259
01:42:59,645 --> 01:43:02,775
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack, but he's OK.

1260
01:43:02,895 --> 01:43:05,905
- He's at St John's.
- Oh, Christ!

1261
01:43:12,285 --> 01:43:14,365
Mom? How is he?

1262
01:43:15,075 --> 01:43:17,705
He was complaining
about chest pains at work.

1263
01:43:17,785 --> 01:43:21,545
The next thing I know he's collapsed.
You gotta talk to him.

1264
01:43:21,665 --> 01:43:25,295
Don't worry, he's a tough old nut.
He's got another 20 years.

1265
01:43:25,425 --> 01:43:28,345
- He's gonna be fine, Buddy.
- Is he conscious?

1266
01:43:45,525 --> 01:43:47,615
Hiya, Dad.

1267
01:43:48,365 --> 01:43:51,575
You're looking younger every day.

1268
01:43:52,745 --> 01:43:56,075
Didn't I tell you never
to lift a 747 by yourself?

1269
01:44:00,035 --> 01:44:02,125
You even got me smoking now.

1270
01:44:05,755 --> 01:44:08,585
It's your second heart attack, Dad.

1271
01:44:09,635 --> 01:44:12,555
You're pushing your luck.
I hope you know that.

1272
01:44:14,015 --> 01:44:16,305
I guess I never told you...

1273
01:44:16,805 --> 01:44:19,105
...but I love you, Dad.

1274
01:44:22,775 --> 01:44:25,065
I love you so much!

1275
01:44:27,655 --> 01:44:30,775
I'm sorry... about the things I said.

1276
01:44:33,695 --> 01:44:36,535
You're the only honest man I know.

1277
01:44:36,615 --> 01:44:38,705
The best.

1278
01:44:40,495 --> 01:44:42,875
I got a plan, Dad. I can save the airline.

1279
01:44:42,995 --> 01:44:47,675
I know you got no reason to believe me,
but you have to trust me, OK?

1280
01:44:48,505 --> 01:44:51,135
I need to speak to the union members.

1281
01:44:52,595 --> 01:44:54,465
Can I speak for you?

1282
01:44:56,135 --> 01:44:58,635
Your words, not mine.

1283
01:45:01,555 --> 01:45:03,645
OK.

1284
01:45:11,985 --> 01:45:14,075
I gotta go.

1285
01:45:14,785 --> 01:45:17,285
I'm proud of you.

1286
01:45:26,455 --> 01:45:28,965
The stock's at 19 1/4, and it's going up.

1287
01:45:29,085 --> 01:45:32,635
Gekko figures, by breaking up Bluestar,
it's 30 bucks a share.

1288
01:45:32,635 --> 01:45:36,175
He'll buy up to 24 and still
think he's making money.

1289
01:45:36,175 --> 01:45:38,265
How do you know it'll go up?

1290
01:45:38,975 --> 01:45:43,145
You don't wanna know, Duncan.
Let's just say I have some friends.

1291
01:45:43,265 --> 01:45:46,275
OK. What happens now?

1292
01:45:46,395 --> 01:45:49,315
When it hits 23, you go
to Gekko and lower the boom.

1293
01:45:49,315 --> 01:45:53,065
When he learns he has no union
concessions, he'll jump ship.

1294
01:45:53,155 --> 01:45:58,285
Yeah, but who'll buy then, and what's
to prevent some other shark devouring us?

1295
01:46:01,415 --> 01:46:03,915
We have an appointment to see Mr Wildman.

1296
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:07,665
Sir Lawrence, or can I call you Larry?

1297
01:46:08,295 --> 01:46:12,885
What would you say to owning Bluestar
Airlines, with union concessions...

1298
01:46:12,885 --> 01:46:14,755
...at $18 a share...

1299
01:46:14,845 --> 01:46:19,425
...and, in the process, hanging
Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist?

1300
01:46:19,555 --> 01:46:22,685
I might be very interested. Why you, mate?

1301
01:46:23,185 --> 01:46:27,275
What's a bloke like you
doing mixed up with Gekko?

1302
01:46:27,355 --> 01:46:32,565
Let's just say that me and Mr Gekko
have a serious conflict of interest.

1303
01:46:33,405 --> 01:46:36,235
But we all wanna see this airline work.

1304
01:46:36,325 --> 01:46:38,945
These figures show that it can.

1305
01:46:40,495 --> 01:46:43,955
You're prepared to take
these large salary cuts?

1306
01:46:44,035 --> 01:46:48,415
We are, but we want a contract
agreement that's ironclad.

1307
01:46:48,545 --> 01:46:51,665
So if you buy it, you can't break it up.

1308
01:46:54,465 --> 01:46:56,545
I'm still listening.

1309
01:47:01,345 --> 01:47:02,595
Hi.

1310
01:47:02,725 --> 01:47:06,475
Oh, hi. Say, why don't you
get the hell out of my office?

1311
01:47:06,685 --> 01:47:09,815
I know I've been a schmuck lately.
I want to apologise.

1312
01:47:10,025 --> 01:47:14,485
You've been a real schmuck lately.
So go thou and sin no more.

1313
01:47:14,605 --> 01:47:16,695
I wanna make it up to you.

1314
01:47:18,575 --> 01:47:21,575
Bluestar. Put all your clients in it.

1315
01:47:27,205 --> 01:47:29,415
OK, Buddy-Buddy.

1316
01:47:29,415 --> 01:47:32,625
We are back in business on Bluestar.

1317
01:47:36,715 --> 01:47:41,095
Bluestar, Mr Mannheim.
Put all your clients in it. It's gonna move.

1318
01:47:41,095 --> 01:47:45,555
I don't know where you get
your information, son, but I don't like it.

1319
01:47:46,305 --> 01:47:51,395
The main thing about money, Bud...
it makes you do things you don't wanna do.

1320
01:47:55,565 --> 01:48:01,825
Marty, a favour. 200,000 shares Bluestar at
19 1/2. Can you position it in an equity fund?

1321
01:48:01,945 --> 01:48:04,955
- The Chronicle is on seven.
- Hold, Marty.

1322
01:48:05,575 --> 01:48:10,495
Listen, Blue Horseshoe
loves Bluestar Airlines. Got it?

1323
01:48:10,495 --> 01:48:13,205
- Got it.
- Right. Marty, you still there?

1324
01:48:13,715 --> 01:48:16,625
Bluestar's in play. Let's check it out.

1325
01:48:25,385 --> 01:48:29,055
- 19 1/4, 3/8. 5,000.
- 3/8 at 10,000.

1326
01:48:31,435 --> 01:48:33,855
I do love it so.

1327
01:48:35,315 --> 01:48:38,315
Gordon, I see it at 21 5/8.
I don't know what to make of it.

1328
01:48:38,865 --> 01:48:43,655
The word is out, pal!
Your union buddies are talking.

1329
01:48:43,745 --> 01:48:46,995
You get me in at a 45-degree angle.
All the way in.

1330
01:48:46,995 --> 01:48:51,455
You slash and burn, you buy everything
in sight up to 22, then call me.

1331
01:48:52,705 --> 01:48:58,045
When I get hold of whoever leaked this, I'll
tear his eyes out and suck his fuckin' skull!

1332
01:49:07,015 --> 01:49:09,095
- Stock's going to Pluto.
- Start unloading.

1333
01:49:09,095 --> 01:49:12,015
- What? Sell?
- Dump it! Now! Dump it all!

1334
01:49:12,015 --> 01:49:14,605
- Where's Lou?
- Right over there.

1335
01:49:15,565 --> 01:49:18,145
Ken? Marvin. Jackson Steinem.

1336
01:49:18,275 --> 01:49:21,615
Dump this baby. Take the money and run.
We're getting out.

1337
01:49:22,445 --> 01:49:24,115
It's gotta be a big hitter.

1338
01:49:24,325 --> 01:49:27,655
There's some people from Bluestar
demanding to see you.

1339
01:49:27,745 --> 01:49:30,995
- What the hell do they want?
- I'd be happy to tell you.

1340
01:49:31,075 --> 01:49:36,085
We know what you're up to, Gekko,
and you can go straight to hell!

1341
01:49:36,205 --> 01:49:38,505
No way you're gonna break up our airline.

1342
01:49:38,585 --> 01:49:43,295
- If that's my plan, it's the first I've heard of it.
- Would you put that in writing?

1343
01:49:43,385 --> 01:49:47,265
We have an agreement,
which I expect you to honour.

1344
01:49:47,265 --> 01:49:52,475
- Then you better have a pilot's licence.
- Don't worry, the engines won't fall out.

1345
01:49:52,475 --> 01:49:56,315
But those reservations can get screwed up
if we don't pay attention.

1346
01:49:56,435 --> 01:49:59,775
Baggage for St Petersburg
could wind up in Pittsburgh.

1347
01:49:59,855 --> 01:50:02,775
Look, somebody else
wants to buy your airline.

1348
01:50:02,905 --> 01:50:07,285
You wanna be gobbled up
by Attila the Hun, you be my guest!

1349
01:50:07,365 --> 01:50:09,455
We'll take our chances.

1350
01:50:09,865 --> 01:50:12,375
Nice to see you, Gekko!

1351
01:50:16,245 --> 01:50:20,215
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23.
What do you want him to do?

1352
01:50:22,295 --> 01:50:24,385
Sell it all.

1353
01:50:25,505 --> 01:50:29,675
- What the hell. So we only make 10 million.
- Sell it. Yes, all of it.

1354
01:50:31,475 --> 01:50:33,555
10,000 at 7/8!

1355
01:50:33,555 --> 01:50:35,225
At 7/8, sold!

1356
01:50:36,145 --> 01:50:38,775
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, for chrissake!

1357
01:50:38,855 --> 01:50:40,645
Goddamn connection!

1358
01:50:40,645 --> 01:50:44,695
Bob, we're in big trouble on BST.
You gotta get out now.

1359
01:50:45,315 --> 01:50:46,485
Another 30,000. Out!

1360
01:50:46,485 --> 01:50:50,245
Gekko's selling. There's not many takers.
The stock is plummeting.

1361
01:50:50,655 --> 01:50:54,415
I guess I'll have to carry him
a few rounds before he drops.

1362
01:50:56,085 --> 01:51:02,755
Don't make a big deal of it. Buy it lightly
on the way down. When it hits 18, buy it all.

1363
01:51:03,045 --> 01:51:04,715
Piece of cake, Larry.

1364
01:51:09,635 --> 01:51:11,725
8,000 at 18.

1365
01:51:13,185 --> 01:51:15,265
What is offered at 18?

1366
01:51:16,305 --> 01:51:18,815
300,000... 300,000 at 18!

1367
01:51:19,025 --> 01:51:20,685
18 for 500,000!

1368
01:51:20,685 --> 01:51:22,775
Sold!

1369
01:51:24,855 --> 01:51:26,945
- I'll sell you 50!
- I'll take it!

1370
01:51:34,115 --> 01:51:37,785
- There's gotta be a way outta this.
- Sure. Why don't you dial 911?

1371
01:51:37,875 --> 01:51:39,955
Fox is on four.

1372
01:51:40,085 --> 01:51:46,135
Where the hell are you? I am losing millions.
You sure as hell better get me out of this...

1373
01:51:46,135 --> 01:51:50,305
...or the only job you'll have
on this street is sweeping it!

1374
01:51:51,215 --> 01:51:55,515
You once told me, don't get emotional
about stock, Gordon. Don't.

1375
01:51:55,595 --> 01:52:00,725
The bid is 16 1/2 and going down.
As your broker, I advise you to take it.

1376
01:52:00,935 --> 01:52:05,605
Yeah? Well, you take it! Right in the ass,
you fuckin' scumbag cocksucker!

1377
01:52:06,775 --> 01:52:11,035
It's two minutes to close, Gordon.
What do you wanna do? Decide.

1378
01:52:15,825 --> 01:52:17,915
Dump it.

1379
01:52:23,665 --> 01:52:27,635
The big Wall Street story today
was Bluestar Airlines.

1380
01:52:28,135 --> 01:52:33,135
Fuelled by takeover rumours, the stock
soared to an all-time high of 24 1/8.

1381
01:52:33,265 --> 01:52:37,305
When rumours later surfaced
that the takeover was unfounded...

1382
01:52:37,435 --> 01:52:44,315
...buyers ran for cover and the stock
plummeted to 16 1/2 before closing at 17.

1383
01:52:44,735 --> 01:52:48,905
Then, amidst all the scuttlebutt,
another rumble shook the street.

1384
01:52:48,985 --> 01:52:54,615
Raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
and bought a substantial block of Bluestar...

1385
01:52:54,745 --> 01:52:59,125
...and will announce a deal tomorrow
that includes the support of the unions.

1386
01:52:59,125 --> 01:53:02,455
We talked with a leading
stock market analyst...

1387
01:53:02,545 --> 01:53:05,795
...in order to understand the ramifications...

1388
01:53:05,795 --> 01:53:07,045
Son of a bitch!

1389
01:53:18,185 --> 01:53:21,225
Smile, Carolyn. There's justice in the world.

1390
01:53:35,825 --> 01:53:37,905
Good morning, folks.

1391
01:53:50,635 --> 01:53:52,715
Did somebody die?

1392
01:53:54,175 --> 01:53:56,265
Yeah.

1393
01:54:02,105 --> 01:54:03,975
Morning, Chuckie. Morning, Lou.

1394
01:54:03,975 --> 01:54:05,645
Bud...

1395
01:54:07,735 --> 01:54:09,815
Bud, I like you.

1396
01:54:10,735 --> 01:54:12,815
Just remember something.

1397
01:54:18,655 --> 01:54:21,165
Man looks in the abyss.

1398
01:54:21,285 --> 01:54:23,785
There's nothing staring back at him.

1399
01:54:23,785 --> 01:54:27,125
At that moment, man finds his character.

1400
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:30,675
And that is what keeps him out of the abyss.

1401
01:54:32,755 --> 01:54:34,845
I think I understand.

1402
01:54:45,895 --> 01:54:48,475
Janet, get my father, will you?

1403
01:54:51,195 --> 01:54:53,905
He just came in. I'll call you back.

1404
01:54:58,695 --> 01:55:01,115
I guess you're not here to open an IRA.

1405
01:55:01,115 --> 01:55:07,045
Henry Patterson, Postal Inspection Service.
Mr Ebenhopper, US Attorney's office.

1406
01:55:07,165 --> 01:55:10,505
Evan Morrissey, Securities and
Exchange Enforcement office.

1407
01:55:10,585 --> 01:55:13,925
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to commit securities fraud...

1408
01:55:14,045 --> 01:55:17,595
...and for violating
the Insider Traders Sanction Act.

1409
01:55:17,595 --> 01:55:21,135
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I knew you were no good.

1410
01:55:21,225 --> 01:55:24,975
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions.

1411
01:55:25,095 --> 01:55:27,605
Anything you do say
may be used against you.

1412
01:55:27,685 --> 01:55:30,315
You have the right to consult an attorney...

1413
01:55:30,315 --> 01:55:34,065
...and to have an attorney present
during any questioning.

1414
01:56:02,515 --> 01:56:04,595
So long, Carolyn.

1415
01:56:17,445 --> 01:56:18,985
Hiya, Buddy.

1416
01:56:19,115 --> 01:56:20,785
Gordon.

1417
01:56:20,865 --> 01:56:23,495
Sandbagged me on Bluestar, huh?

1418
01:56:24,405 --> 01:56:29,835
I guess you think you taught the teacher
a lesson, that the tail can wag the dog, huh?

1419
01:56:33,165 --> 01:56:35,165
Well, let me clue you in, pal.

1420
01:56:35,255 --> 01:56:38,925
The ice is melting right underneath your feet.

1421
01:56:42,135 --> 01:56:46,635
You think you could have gotten this far
this fast with anybody else?

1422
01:56:46,635 --> 01:56:48,725
And dickin' someone like Darien?

1423
01:56:48,725 --> 01:56:54,855
No. You'd be cold-calling widows and
dentists to buy fuckin' dogshit stock!

1424
01:56:54,985 --> 01:56:56,735
I took you in!

1425
01:56:57,065 --> 01:56:58,945
A nobody!

1426
01:56:59,565 --> 01:57:01,445
I opened doors for you.

1427
01:57:01,525 --> 01:57:06,325
I showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

1428
01:57:06,455 --> 01:57:09,455
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources, Geodynamics!

1429
01:57:09,575 --> 01:57:12,295
And this is how you fuckin'
pay me back, you cockroach!

1430
01:57:14,795 --> 01:57:16,875
I gave you Darien!

1431
01:57:17,295 --> 01:57:20,925
I gave you your manhood!
I gave you everything!

1432
01:57:33,145 --> 01:57:35,935
You coulda been one of
the great ones, Buddy.

1433
01:57:37,525 --> 01:57:40,735
I look at you... and I see myself.

1434
01:57:42,735 --> 01:57:44,825
Why?

1435
01:57:46,155 --> 01:57:48,245
I don't know.

1436
01:57:49,915 --> 01:57:52,125
I guess I realised that...

1437
01:57:52,415 --> 01:57:54,705
...I'm just Bud Fox.

1438
01:57:56,705 --> 01:57:59,625
As much as I wanted to be Gordon Gekko...

1439
01:58:00,255 --> 01:58:02,635
...I'll always be Bud Fox.

1440
01:58:48,925 --> 01:58:53,015
I showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

1441
01:58:53,095 --> 01:58:55,185
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources...

1442
01:58:58,645 --> 01:59:01,145
You did the right thing, Bud.

1443
01:59:08,655 --> 01:59:10,955
You told the truth
and gave the money back.

1444
01:59:11,035 --> 01:59:14,995
All things considered in this
cockamamie world, you're shooting par.

1445
01:59:15,125 --> 01:59:18,665
You helped save the airline,
and they'll remember you for it.

1446
01:59:18,665 --> 01:59:23,045
That's right. Think about the job
at Bluestar that Wildman offered you.

1447
01:59:23,125 --> 01:59:25,545
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.

1448
01:59:25,845 --> 01:59:29,385
Yeah, well... maybe that's the price, son.

1449
01:59:29,515 --> 01:59:31,595
It's gonna be hard on you...

1450
01:59:31,675 --> 01:59:36,685
...but maybe in a kind of screwed-up way it's
the best thing that coulda happened to you.

1451
01:59:36,805 --> 01:59:40,565
Stop going for the easy buck
and produce something with your life.

1452
01:59:40,645 --> 01:59:44,735
Create, instead of living off
the buying and selling of others.

1453
01:59:50,235 --> 01:59:52,655
We'll park the car and catch up with you.

1454
01:59:52,745 --> 01:59:54,415
All right.
