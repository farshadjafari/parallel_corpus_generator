1
00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:02,132
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,467
- I'm Sybil.
- We are talking

3
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:05,873
about a living, breathing siren.

4
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:09,256
Damon is completely devoted to me.

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,993
This thing, it was delivered
with your vault inhabitant.

6
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,128
I think it was made in hell.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,096
It's a tuning fork.

8
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:19,968
Damon, it's over.

9
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,068
You're free now.

10
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,437
I wish that were the case, Stefan,

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,573
but my work with her is
just getting started.

12
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:27,027
I really hoped that
when we put Sybil down,

13
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,971
it'd break whatever
control she had over him.

14
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:31,646
But somehow, some way,
she still has ahold of him.

15
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,981
What else is there to do?

16
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,082
You still have too many attachments.

17
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:37,252
Too many people willing to fight for you.

18
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:38,436
We should work on that.

19
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,232
Lockwood.

20
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:40,429
Damon, wait!

21
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,718
Sirens use mind control

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,359
to lure their victims to their death.

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,396
Some say they're messengers of the Devil.

24
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:49,225
I suppose every story
has to start somewhere.

25
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,240
Tell me a story.

26
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:01,409
What kind of story?

27
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:05,013
Something happy.

28
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:07,314
A long time ago,

29
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,817
in a village

30
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,153
built on this very spot,

31
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,120
lived a man.

32
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,823
Arcadius.

33
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:22,631
Cade, to his friends,
of which he had many.

34
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:25,183
He was a gentle man,

35
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,670
loved and respected.

36
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:36,110
But Cade could do something
that no one else could:

37
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:39,829
he could see into the minds of others.

38
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,692
He was psychic?

39
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,395
The first psychic.

40
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:58,066
It was this power that gave him
so much empathy towards others.

41
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:02,870
And it was this power that
would cost him his life.

42
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,890
The thing you imagine, brother...

43
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,161
It is impure.

44
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:27,496
It's forbidden.

45
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:30,564
If you allow me deeper into your mind,

46
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,069
perhaps I can help quell your urges.

47
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,570
Cade had only wanted to help.

48
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,073
But he had overstepped.

49
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,284
And the men, fearing his power,

50
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,417
turned even Cade's friends against him.

51
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:54,389
And it was then that
Cade came to know

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,956
the thing inside men

53
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,459
that even his power

54
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:59,661
had not been able to divine:

55
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,663
true evil.

56
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:12,206
I asked for a happy story.

57
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,876
But it is, dear sister.

58
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:18,546
For in death, Cade was triumphant.

59
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,414
From that moment onward,

60
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,450
evil men would be forever punished

61
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,520
for their wicked deeds.

62
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:27,588
Cade had his revenge.

63
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,123
And someday,

64
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,460
so will we.

65

66
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,185
Hey.

67
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:58,252
Hey.

68
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:00,155
For future reference,

69
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,157
just because I spend
the night with Bonnie

70
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,759
doesn't mean you can't
sleep in your own bed.

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,127
Right, yeah, no.
I-I crashed at the Armory.

72
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,431
I figured I'd give you two some space.

73
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,764
How's Bonnie doing?

74
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:11,967
Glued to Enzo's side,

75
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,368
despite all the awful
things he's saying to her.

76
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,370
It's gonna take another
day or two of starving him

77
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:19,040
before she can get started
with his humanity switch.

78
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,175
Well, if anyone can bring him back,

79
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,175
Bonnie can.

80
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,237
Hey, you know what,

81
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,411
I should probably get going.

82
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,613
Alaric and I

83
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:27,749
have a little date with a siren.

84
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,949
Be careful.

85
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,218
You've seen what Sybil can do

86
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,653
when she gets inside your head.

87
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,088
As long as this tuning fork
is ringing, she can't.

88
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,624
Is there some sort of engaged person

89
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,659
shorthand for "Good luck and...

90
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:39,927
I'm with you in spirit"?

91
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,696
Yeah, I think it's "I love you."

92
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,632
I love you, too.

93
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,668
Hey, thanks.

94
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,582
Oh, thank the nanny.
She's the unwitting enabler.

95
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,338
Oh, hey.

96
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,673
Uh...

97
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:53,937
I thought I told you
not to come in today.

98
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,644
Well, I heard there was a coffee shortage

99
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:57,077
and came running.

100
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,146
Well, actually,

101
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,488
we're in the middle of a major project.

102
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:00,723
So why don't you take the day off...

103
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:02,149
Major project? Sounds sketchy.

104
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,851
Got a girl tied up in the basement?

105
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,600
Jokes.

106
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,435
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

107
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,329
I can only deal with
one temptress at a time.

108
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,231
Anyway, any word from Damon?

109
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,802
None. And that's what worries me.

110
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,481
Hey!

111
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:37,685
Hey! Earth to Planet Redneck.

112
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,120
Are you Peter Maxwell?

113
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,423
No, Pete owns the place.

114
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,091
I'm just the hired help.

115
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,959
Name's Lou. What can I do for you?

116
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,362
I really need to talk to Pete.

117
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,163
Well, have it your way.

118
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,932
He should be back in a bit.

119
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,951
Hey, what exactly brings you out here?

120
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:56,571
You know, it's hard to say.

121
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:57,805
To be honest, I'm not even the one

122
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,707
that cares about finding your boss.

123
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,343
There is a woman...
and I use that term loosely...

124
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:04,778
Named Sybil, who wants to.

125
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,382
So, inexplicably,

126
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:09,918
here I am.

127
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,553
Sounds like that gal's
screwing with your head.

128
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:15,456
Oh, you have no idea.

129
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,526
You'd be surprised.
I've been married five times.

130
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:22,529
Oh, I take that back.

131
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:24,199
You do get me, Lou.

132
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,401
See, the catch is:

133
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:27,968
Sybil and I had a thing,

134
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,103
but it's done.

135
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,704
In theory, I'm a free man,

136
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:33,540
but I still find myself
doing whatever it is

137
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,576
I think she'd want me to be doing.

138
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,411
Hell, between you and me,

139
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,180
I'd probably kill for her.

140
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,651
Pete'll be back soon.
I should get back to work.

141
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,153
No,

142
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,588
you should do everything I say.

143
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:50,894
Just answer one more question for me.

144
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,927
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

145
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:56,965
I murdered one of those
wives I told you about.

146
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,766
Made it look like an accident.

147
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,935
Don't move.

148
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:05,072
Oh, damn. I was rooting for you, Lou.

149
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,976
I really was.

150
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,821
Now, like you said...

151
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,389
get back to work.

152
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:46,747
The all-powerful siren.

153
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,617
Imprisoned by a fork.

154
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:52,319
Says the man who can
be killed with a stick.

155
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,855
What is it about this thing

156
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:54,889
that hurts you so much?

157
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,372
And why does it hurt my kids?

158
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:58,793
And here I thought you
had me all figured out.

159
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,127
Guess not.

160
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,266
If this dis upts your psychic ability,

161
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,336
then why is Damon still your puppet?

162
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:12,841
I tinkered with the deepest
reaches of his subconscious.

163
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,776
If Damon's still serving me,
it's because deep down,

164
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,011
he wants to.

165
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,581
Why are you doing this to him?

166
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,949
It's all Damon, Damon, Damon.

167
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,617
Aren't you even a little curious

168
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,086
about who I am?

169
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,954
No, actually.

170
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:30,490
All I care about is how
to save my brother.

171
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:31,860
Well, fortunately,

172
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,095
the answer to your question is...

173
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,630
a story. About me.

174
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,299
You like stories, don't you, Professor?

175
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,469
I prefer nonfiction.

176
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,671
Well, then you'll love this one.

177
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,706
A long time ago,

178
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,908
in a little Mediterranean village,

179
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,344
there was a girl.

180
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,278
As she came of age,

181
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,446
the village girl began to
manifest psychic abilities,

182
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:56,517
a trait that had been
forbidden in her land

183
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,653
for as long as anyone could remember.

184
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:00,520
Help me, please!

185
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:01,655
The fate of psychics

186
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,091
was exile.

187
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:04,424
Which is how our poor,

188
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,260
innocent, forsaken village girl

189
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:08,328
ended up on a raft...

190
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:09,931
The current carrying her

191
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:13,000
into the rocks of a cold
and distant shore.

192
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:27,749
But abandoned though she was meant to be,

193
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,817
alone she was not.

194
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,125
There she met

195
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,360
the girl of the island.

196
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,979
Exiled together,

197
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,668
connected in psychic ability,

198
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,138
two sisters in everything but blood,

199
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:53,640
destined from that moment
to one day become...

200
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,503
...the sirens.

201
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,546
So you see, Stefan,

202
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:01,883
I understand why you would
do anything for your brother.

203
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:07,922
Because my sister
will do anything for me.

204
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:10,057
Will do?

205
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,993
Present tense?

206
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:15,395
Oh, did I forget to
mention there are two of us?

207
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,167
Me in here.

208
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,269
And her out there.

209
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,221
Ugh!

210
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:34,313
Would you please stop doing that?

211
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:36,149
It is complete overkill.

212
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:37,850
What do you mean, two sirens?

213
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,352
I thought you were a scholar.

214
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,822
Every single mythological
interpretation of who I am

215
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:45,225
mentions sirens... plural.

216
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:47,427
Well, those same myths
also say that you should

217
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,028
have the lower half of a bird.

218
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,065
Well, luckily for us all,

219
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,967
you can't believe
everything that you read.

220
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,102
Enough.

221
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,837
Who is she?

222
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,373
Patience, Stefan.

223
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,142
I promise you'll find out soon enough.

224
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,527
Oh, crap.

225
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:35,241
Oh, yes.

226
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:43,115
Don't move, or I call the police!

227
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:49,789
Oh... it's the intern.

228
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,447
Oh... the nanny.

229
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:54,027
It's Georgie, right?

230
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:56,230
Do you break into houses often?

231
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,032
I got to get into Alaric's bed somehow.

232
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:02,235
Uh, okay, the boss man just asked me

233
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,916
to bring this journal back to the Armory,

234
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:06,773
and like a dumbass, I didn't
think to ask him for the keys.

235
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,543
I just figured I'd save
myself an embarrassing call.

236
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,077
Well, the call I'm about to make

237
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,879
is probably even more embarrassing.

238
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,313
Okay.

239
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,446
Maybe you better stay put.

240
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:18,851
Maybe you should stick
to naps and snacks.

241
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:21,721
Okeydokey. Calling Ric.

242
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:25,458
I really wouldn't do that if I were you.

243
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,706
You must be Peter Maxwell.

244
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:40,706
Who the hell are you?

245
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,176
Damon Salvatore. AKA...

246
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:47,179
the guy that barbecued your
little grease monkey over there.

247
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,711
No offense, Pete, but I don't think

248
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,283
that extinguisher's gonna work.

249
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,686
Lou's got a date for an eternal burn.

250
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:57,857
Uh, before you make that
phone call, I want you

251
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
to ask yourself one question.

252
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,695
If I just murdered your
faithful manservant

253
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,196
in cold blood, why would I have

254
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:05,331
any problem murdering you?

255
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:10,202
Good boy.

256
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:11,871
But that was a trick question, Pete.

257
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,875
I can't actually kill you... yet.

258
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:16,576
Well, that's comforting, I guess.

259
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:17,744
You ever meet a girl named Sybil?

260
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:19,846
About yay high, hot as hell.

261
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,649
Face rots off when she
doesn't feed on human flesh?

262
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,716
You're insane.

263
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,184
I'm gonna take that as a no, Pete.

264
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,821
Then again, you could be lying to me.

265
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,957
Now tell me the truth. Do you have any idea

266
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,527
- what I'm talking about?
- No.

267
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,828
Everything you're saying sounds crazy.

268
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,868
Damn it.

269
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,636
I'm gonna make this as simple as I can.

270
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,706
You have something Sybil wants,

271
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,039
I'm gonna deliver it.

272
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,543
You can take whatever it is and just go.

273
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:51,278
That's not an option, Pete.

274
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,279
I don't exactly know what I'm looking for.

275
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,947
Then how are you supposed to find it?

276
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,817
We, Pete. We.

277
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,902
Here's the deal.

278
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:00,653
All I consciously know is that it's

279
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:02,322
a Maxwell family heirloom.

280
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:04,524
But subconsciously, I'm pretty damn sure

281
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,293
I'll know it when I see it.

282
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:09,162
Okay? So where should we start looking?

283
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:10,797
I-I have no idea.

284
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:13,332
Look, the only family I have is my son.

285
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,568
I need you to think real hard,

286
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,903
'cause your life depends on it.

287
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:17,903
A couple years ago,

288
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,505
my grandmother died, all right?

289
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,207
She left me a box of stuff.

290
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,475
Sounds promising.

291
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:23,677
What kind of stuff we talking about?

292
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:25,345
I don't know. I never opened it.

293
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,259
Family's a bit of a sore spot with me.

294
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,682
Trust me, I know the feeling, man.

295
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:31,217
Where's this box, Pete?

296
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,686
It's somewhere in the storage room.

297
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,153
My son was looking for it a while back.

298
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:36,523
- Maybe he found it, all right?
- Oh, good.

299
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,325
Call Junior. Get him over here.

300
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:39,826
Now.

301
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:46,899
It's Seline. You got this?

302
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,268
Yeah.

303
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:51,538
Seline? Suspicious name.

304
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,005
Very siren-y.

305
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,174
How about we just focus
on you and your sister?

306
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:58,711
I think I'll just wait
for Alaric to get back.

307
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:01,214
You're stalling.

308
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,682
Who is she?

309
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:06,086
You think hurting me
is gonna speed this up?

310
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,428
Thank you.

311
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:18,597
Now, despite enjoying
each other's company,

312
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,701
the girls had another
constant companion...

313
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:22,903
hunger.

314
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:24,770
The one who had survived

315
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:28,408
on the island this long had a plan.

316
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:30,644
Call out to them with me.

317
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,280
They will never hear us.

318
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:36,216
Raise your voice,

319
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,451
and your mind will soar out to meet it.

320
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:46,826
Help!

321
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:48,427
Over here!

322
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:49,596
Help!

323
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:51,664
Help! Help!

324
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,700
Please. Over here.

325
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:54,835
Help! Here!

326
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,937
They heard us.

327
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:58,981
The ship is coming our way.

328
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,639
We are saved.

329
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,293
Over here.

330
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,514
But the girl of the island

331
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:09,749
knew better.

332
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,618
She had done this before,

333
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,221
called out to passing
sailors with her mind.

334
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:17,423
But no matter how keen her psychic reach,

335
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:20,326
the shoals around the
island were sharper.

336
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:22,162
So you beached the ship.

337
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:23,797
Try annihilated.

338
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:27,366
Dashed upon the rocks,
dooming its sailors to death.

339
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,875
But, silver lining,

340
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,770
their sweet, sweet provisions

341
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:34,341
would soon wash up on shore.

342
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,187
The tides were not in our favor today.

343
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:49,221
This is all that washed up.

344
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,658
You knew this would happen?

345
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:53,259
The island is barren,

346
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:56,562
save for berries and wild boar.

347
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,163
This way is easier...

348
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:01,668
and more fun.

349
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,905
Sister, do not weep for them.

350
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:08,875
Those sailors were from our village.

351
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:12,077
The same men who banished us here to die.

352
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,847
Never again.

353
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,718
If we cannot live off of
what God has provided for us,

354
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,854
then we are not meant to live at all.

355
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,356
Promise me?

356
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:30,630
Stop me if this sounds familiar.

357
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,833
One good sibling,
determined to live like a monk,

358
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,236
and one selfishly evil sibling,

359
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,872
willing to murder to
satiate their hunger.

360
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,842
Oh, come on, you get it.

361
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,944
The parallels are too good.

362
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:48,181
Our story is your story, Stefan.

363
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:50,549
So now here's the test.

364
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:53,052
Which girl are you?

365
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:04,897
So, uh, what do you think?

366
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,467
I think it's a hood ornament, Pete.

367
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,436
Vintage Rolls-Royce.

368
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,505
Aah! I also think

369
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:14,473
that you're in danger
of losing a real life.

370
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,476
I'm doing what you asked.

371
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,111
Oh, are you? I compelled you

372
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,346
to find what I needed.

373
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,480
You keep bringing me a bunch of junk.

374
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,719
Where'd you get that watch?

375
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:28,662
My son gave it to me.
What difference does it make?

376
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:30,601
Considering that it's a family heirloom,

377
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,226
quite a bit... Hand it over.

378
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,134
Aah!

379
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:44,938
You're on vervain.

380
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,007
I don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,709
You lied to me, Pete.

382
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,911
And you know what happens to liars.

383
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,117
They go straight to hell.

384
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:06,122
Donovan?

385
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,930
Dad.

386
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:17,042
Don't move, don't move. Let me see it.

387
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:22,713
All right, look, it's not that bad, okay?

388
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:24,450
Just keep some pressure on it,
you're gonna be fine.

389
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,750
Don't lie to me, Matt.

390
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:27,511
Look, you're gonna be fine

391
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,055
if you do exactly as I say.

392
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,326
- What are you doing?
- I need you to drink his blood.

393
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:36,162
Why? I'll explain later,

394
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:38,596
but right now I need
you to trust me, okay?

395
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,549
- Drink.
- N-No...

396
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,339
Wha-What?

397
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:57,523
- What just happened?
- I told you I'll explain everything.

398
00:19:57,548 --> 00:19:59,797
But first I need to understand why
Damon was trying to hurt you.

399
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,121
Wait, you're telling me you,
you knew this guy?

400
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:03,655
I'm telling you that I know him.

401
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:06,692
He's not dead. Not exactly.

402
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,428
I know. None of this makes
any sense, and I know.

403
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,695
I tracked you down a few months ago

404
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:12,009
and I didn't tell you about any of this.

405
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:13,566
Okay, I'm sorry, but I promise,

406
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,534
if you go to the truck right now,
I'll explain everything.

407
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:18,170
I just don't want you to
see what happens next.

408
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:31,317
Look, I... I feel silly calling.
It's probably nothing.

409
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:32,488
Why, what's going on?

410
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:36,021
Well, your intern Georgie,
she broke into the house.

411
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:36,989
Wait, she what?

412
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,391
And she took a book.

413
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:39,625
Some dead guy's journal.

414
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,326
Said that she was
bringing it back to you?

415
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:43,061
Well, are you okay? Are the girls?

416
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:44,195
Yeah. Why?

417
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:45,564
Should I be more worried?

418
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,500
I mean, she's just a
little weirdo, right?

419
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,727
It's, uh, it's fine.
Hey, thanks for calling.

420
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,923
I-I gotta call you back, okay?

421
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:05,483
Hello?

422
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:08,686
Georgie?

423
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:11,356
I'm here. Sorry.

424
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:13,491
Wait!

425
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:15,394
Look, we don't have to be enemies.

426
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:17,462
Damon and I had nothing
to do with the Armory

427
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:19,131
until you possessed him.

428
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,523
If we're enemies, it's because

429
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:22,468
you chose this path.

430
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,804
- I didn't ask for any of this.
- God.

431
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,477
You sound just like her.

432
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,174
A victim to the last.

433
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:33,244
She insisted the island
would nourish them.

434
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,622
And when it didn't, her faith was shaken.

435
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:38,416
God did not provide.

436
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:40,586
That was up to her sister.

437
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:43,756
The other side of the island
was the wild boars' domain.

438
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:46,558
It was dangerous,
but she knew she must hunt.

439
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,326
And behold.

440
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:50,962
God was good.

441
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:53,132
Or maybe there were
no boars on the island.

442
00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:55,401
You kept luring ships into the rocks.

443
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:57,269
Killing for provisions.

444
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,978
And do you want to know
the sickest part of all?

445
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,909
There were no provisions on the ships.

446
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,644
Only sailors.

447
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:10,547
And so, an innocent
girl became a monster.

448
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:11,294
All because

449
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:14,353
her older sibling forced
her to adopt her lifestyle,

450
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:17,256
even if it meant
killing and eating men

451
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:18,757
to stay alive.

452
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,425
So, I ask you again.

453
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:23,328
Which girl are you?

454
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,598
Here's all you need to know.

455
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:30,301
Whatever Damon and I have done
to one another in the past,

456
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:31,971
it has been forgiven.

457
00:22:31,972 --> 00:22:34,140
He is my brother,

458
00:22:34,142 --> 00:22:39,144
and there's nothing you can
do that will ever change that.

459
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:43,656
I think you've overestimated your sibling.

460
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,819
And clearly, I have underestimated mine.

461
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,529
Hey, sailor.

462
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,565
What did you do to me?

463
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:18,388
I'm in your head.

464
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,349
Well, our head, kind of.

465
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,053
My memories, your noggin.

466
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:24,872
Your silly fork stopped ringing.

467
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,300
There's nowhere to run.

468
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:29,869
So walk with me.

469
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:33,840
Oh, so is this where you attack my psyche?

470
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:35,441
Try to break me down?

471
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:36,714
Normally, yes.

472
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,644
But the boss has other plans for you.

473
00:23:38,646 --> 00:23:40,447
- The boss?
- Mm-hmm.

474
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:42,048
What are you talking about?

475
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,617
He thinks you're worthy of
hearing the whole story.

476
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,588
Shall we continue?

477
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:57,830
For years, my sister
and I lived as cannibals.

478
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,900
One willingly,

479
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:02,035
one blissfully ignorant.

480
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:04,738
Until I discovered this.

481
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,076
Where my sister had buried
the sailors she had murdered.

482
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:11,406
Only visible at low tide.

483
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,547
It was the perfect hiding spot.

484
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:15,115
You discovered?

485
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,720
You're not the girl from
the island, are you?

486
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,387
You're the village girl.

487
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,259
I tried.

488
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,228
I tried so hard to be good.

489
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,292
My sister forced this existence on me.

490
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:34,468
What, you expect me
to have sympathy for you?

491
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,701
After everything you've done?

492
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:38,105
Maybe, maybe not.

493
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:40,907
It all comes down to the same question:

494
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:46,547
which siren is your
spirit animal, Stefan?

495
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:57,423
Oh, come on, man, drop the act.

496
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:59,644
We both know you're not gonna kill me.

497
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:00,560
Why not?

498
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:02,222
That seems to be your
solution for everything.

499
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,469
Maybe I should give it a shot.

500
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:06,299
I'm sorry, Matt, I know
this is supposed to scare me,

501
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:07,800
but fear is an emotion,

502
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:09,536
and ever since I flipped my switch,

503
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:11,371
I'm kind of operating without them.

504
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,240
All I'm getting from you

505
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,275
is desperation.

506
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:17,376
You're right, Damon, I am desperate.

507
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:19,145
And for once,

508
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:20,846
I don't care about your drama.

509
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:23,257
I don't give a damn if you
shut your humanity off.

510
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:25,719
All I want to know is why
you tried to kill my father.

511
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:27,153
Look, man, in my defense,

512
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:28,922
I didn't know he was your dad.

513
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:30,824
I always thought you were a bastard.

514
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:32,925
Shut up, I'm done playing games.

515
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:38,198
Well, Tyler Lockwood is gonna
be very sad to hear that.

516
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,700
Because if you don't play along,

517
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:41,462
he dies.

518
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:43,547
Maybe you care about that?

519
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,207
Not even you're that stupid.

520
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:48,709
Humanity or not,

521
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,076
nobody'd forgive you for that.

522
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:51,444
Especially Elena.

523
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,413
Well, that's the whole point, you idiot.

524
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:55,781
Apparently, you've been out
of the loop for a while, Matt,

525
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:58,984
so allow me to bring you up to speed.

526
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:01,954
Elena and I are through.

527
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:03,557
In fact,

528
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:05,826
I've been seeing another woman.

529
00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:08,862
You're lying. Last time
I knew, Tyler was up in, uh...

530
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:10,596
In New York?

531
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:12,665
Am I lying or being completely truthful

532
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:15,965
when I tell you that I ripped
into Tyler's throat last night?

533
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,771
And then I took him on a road trip.

534
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:21,508
Left him bleeding in the
back of a green Mustang

535
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:23,836
at the Park 'N Go off I-20,

536
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:26,221
right across the border.

537
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:30,116
Now, is that too specific for a lie?

538
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:32,818
It's your move, Matt.

539
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,988
Ticktock.

540
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:37,824
If you hurt Tyler,

541
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:40,894
I swear to God, I will kill you.

542
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:45,365
Well, you can swear to God all you want.

543
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:48,167
He's not the one listening.

544
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:08,587
Hey, uh... Stefan.

545
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:10,289
Or Caroline.

546
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,392
I guess this is my modern-day version

547
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:13,693
of a dead man's journal.

548
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:16,762
P.S. I believe Georgie
is the second siren,

549
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,365
in case you haven't figured it out.

550
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:22,803
Ironically, Georgie is how
I know the way out of here

551
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:25,505
is through a tunnel system
behind one of these walls.

552
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:27,074
Anyway, to find that
wall and pass through it,

553
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:29,762
I have to deprive myself
of sight and sound.

554
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:32,045
Now, while blindfolding myself is easy...

555
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:34,314
the hearing part,

556
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:35,804
it's gonna be tough.

557
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:42,154
Anyway,

558
00:27:42,156 --> 00:27:45,392
nothing a little vampire blood
can't fix on the "B" side.

559
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:47,594
At least that's what I keep
telling myself, so,

560
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:50,230
on that reassuring note...

561
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:51,464
over and out.

562
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,278
I couldn't believe it.

563
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,047
All those years,

564
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:10,650
my sister tricked me
into eating human flesh.

565
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:13,252
But I had to hear the
truth from her mouth,

566
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:15,255
so I confronted her.

567
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:18,491
You should've seen the look on her face.

568
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,461
Oh, wait, you will.

569
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:23,663
Here she comes now.

570
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:31,671
No.

571
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:34,273
Stefan, you've met my sister.

572
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:36,175
Seline.

573
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:41,847
Get it tucked in for you.

574
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:43,215
Oh!

575
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:46,886
One second, chickadees.

576
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:49,256
- Hello?
- Alaric is trapped.

577
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:51,223
Why did you make me do that?

578
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:53,026
Just pull over wherever you are

579
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:55,162
and stay there, I will find you.

580
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:57,197
We'll talk about it then.

581
00:28:57,199 --> 00:29:00,200
Will you tell us a story?

582
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,934
Sure, sweetie. What kind of story?

583
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:03,336
Nothing sad.

584
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:05,505
Hmm.

585
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:07,874
Okay.

586
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,252
I know just the one,

587
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:12,878
but we'll have to keep it between us.

588
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,582
No telling Mommy or Daddy.

589
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,851
It is called

590
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:21,221
"The Legend of Arcadius."

591
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,583
Hello?

592
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:35,853
Little help in here.

593
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:44,427
Guess it's time for plan B.

594
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:57,775
The bad news...

595
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:02,445
Plan B always sucks.

596
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:19,462
Hello, beautiful.

597
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:23,400
I've been looking all over for you.

598
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:32,142
Don't ask me how I know this,

599
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:35,045
or what the hell you're supposed to do,

600
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:39,316
but Sybil's gonna be
very happy to see you.

601
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:43,138
Seline is the other siren?

602
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:47,251
What's more shocking? That she
secretly fed me human flesh?

603
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:50,612
Or that she's now masquerading
as a friggin' nanny?

604
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:52,441
Get out of my head. Now.

605
00:30:52,465 --> 00:30:54,715
Why, so you can go warn Alaric?

606
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:56,984
You're assuming that I'm
gonna let you remember this

607
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,252
when you wake up.

608
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,154
Sorry.

609
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:01,589
Orders from above.

610
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,592
Well, below.

611
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:17,739
What did you do to me?

612
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,973
You tell me.

613
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:20,674
What do you remember?

614
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,315
You confronted your sister.

615
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:31,385
She turned you into a
cannibal against your wishes.

616
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:34,888
And who exactly is my sister?

617
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,096
I don't know.

618
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:45,266
How frustrating.

619
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:48,536
Why are you still here?

620
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,337
I was out cold, you were in my head.

621
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,406
Why didn't you escape?

622
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,541
And leave you with such
a dramatic cliffhanger?

623
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:56,845
I'm not that evil.

624
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:00,147
I was about to answer your question.

625
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,183
How you can save your brother.

626
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:06,221
But for the last time, I need to know:

627
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:10,025
are you an island girl or a village girl?

628
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:12,693
Wait!

629
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:15,096
Answer me, Stefan. This is important.

630
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:17,298
Who are you in this story?

631
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:21,803
The victim, who tried for years
not to feed on human blood,

632
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:25,440
only for his selfish brother to
blow into town and ruin it all?

633
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,142
Or are you the monster,

634
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:29,711
who sealed his brother's
fate the day you forced him

635
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:31,779
to turn into a vampire?

636
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,815
Who doomed his brother
to an eternity of misery

637
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:36,317
because you were afraid of being alone?

638
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:38,118
There you go again.

639
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:39,988
Old history.

640
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,391
You'd be surprised how
fresh it is in Damon's mind.

641
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:45,226
Answer me.

642
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:47,394
Who are you?

643
00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:56,871
I'm both.

644
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:05,913
I was wrong about you, Stefan.

645
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:08,883
You are worthy.

646
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:11,553
You're ready for the truth.

647
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:14,748
When I learned the truth
about what my sister had done

648
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:16,191
for me,

649
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:19,928
I did the only thing a
decent person could do.

650
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,895
I threw myself off the cliffs.

651
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:24,343
As I lay dying,

652
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,326
I prayed. For mercy.

653
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:28,356
For love. For forgiveness.

654
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,481
Oh... help... somebody help...

655
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:33,195
But God never answered me.

656
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:36,611
Instead, he did.

657
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:39,814
My beautiful, broken children.

658
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:43,785
Who are you?

659
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,586
You know.

660
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,122
Arcadius?

661
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,989
Everyone calls me Cade.

662
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:52,460
You are supposed to be dead.

663
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,894
Rest assured.

664
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,864
I am.

665
00:33:58,634 --> 00:33:59,901
My sister.

666
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:01,469
Can you help her?

667
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:02,903
Yes.

668
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:04,471
But...

669
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:07,174
there is a price.

670
00:34:07,176 --> 00:34:08,909
Anything.

671
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:12,646
My sister...

672
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:15,817
She made a deal with Cade.

673
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,585
Immortality,

674
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:20,454
beauty and youth, for the two of us...

675
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:24,692
if only we served our
new Lord and master.

676
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:28,195
We feast on the flesh
to keep us beautiful,

677
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:31,166
and he collects the souls of the wicked.

678
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:33,067
In hell.

679
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:35,068
Hell?

680
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:38,806
As in, literal hell.

681
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,340
Come on.

682
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:41,943
Just tell me the truth.

683
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,478
Who's Cade?

684
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,112
What is he?

685
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:48,182
He's the answer to all
your problems, Stefan.

686
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,916
You want to save your brother?

687
00:34:54,273 --> 00:34:57,407
All you have to do is kill the Devil.

688
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:05,755
I don't believe you.

689
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,217
Which part? We covered a lot of ground.

690
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:10,675
Hell. The Devil. None of it exists.

691
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:13,878
Did you believe in vampires
before you fell in love with one

692
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,581
and became one yourself?

693
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,815
That's the trouble with facts, Stefan.

694
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:20,284
They're true whether you
believe in them or not.

695
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,719
I promise you,

696
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,554
just as my sister promised me.

697
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:26,692
There was a man named Cade.

698
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:29,094
The people he loved damned him.

699
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:32,626
And only at the very end did
he finally give up on them,

700
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:35,199
only when the smell
of his burning flesh

701
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:37,036
was searing his nostrils,

702
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:40,239
did he see them for
what they really were.

703
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,942
Monsters.

704
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:45,365
Just like you and me.

705
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,780
So, Cade damned them in return.
With his last breath,

706
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:51,250
he let loose a psychic blast so powerful

707
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,018
that it created its own world.

708
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:00,626
Call it hell if you want.

709
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,927
It doesn't matter what name you give it

710
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:05,030
or whether you believe in it or not.

711
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:06,965
Either way, that is where Cade feeds

712
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,300
on the souls of the damned.

713
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:12,137
It's where he waits for you, Stefan.

714
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:16,641
Stop making this about me.

715
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,143
I'm trying to help my brother.

716
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,346
Oh, but this is about you.

717
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,880
Did you really think

718
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:25,717
all your pathetic attempts at atonement

719
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,853
would save you from the
fate that, deep down,

720
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,987
you know you deserve?

721
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:33,458
A fate befitting the
glorious Ripper of Monterey?

722
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,516
No.

723
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:44,168
That was almost 100 years ago.

724
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,871
I'm not that person anymore.

725
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:48,257
It doesn't matter, Stefan.

726
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:50,976
That stain will always be
on your soul, no matter

727
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:53,512
how hard you try to wash it away.

728
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:55,213
So, stop fighting.

729
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,483
It's easier that way.

730
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:02,753
Maybe I do deserve it,

731
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:06,525
but Damon doesn't,
because I made him what he is.

732
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:09,427
So, if it's my fault,

733
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,697
damn me.

734
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,831
Not him.

735
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,402
Damon's fate is already sealed.

736
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,739
I reached into his mind and gave him

737
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,909
a look at what awaits him,
and even that little spoonful

738
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,146
was enough to make him flip
his little humanity switch.

739
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,128
He chose to serve Cade for all eternity,

740
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:34,418
rather than experience another
second in that kind of torment.

741
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,255
Damon believes in hell.

742
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,260
And soon you will, too.

743
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:45,630
Because you're just as doomed as he is.

744
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,989
So Mystic Falls is overrun

745
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:13,224
with supernatural creatures,

746
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:16,195
and... vampires are real.

747
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:18,329
They feed on human blood
and can even control people

748
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:19,764
if they want to.

749
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,137
Okay, so why couldn't
Damon compel me, then?

750
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:27,239
It's because of that watch I gave you.

751
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,775
It's full of something called vervain.

752
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:33,612
A glass of vervain every day

753
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:35,981
keeps the vampires at bay.

754
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:39,208
Yeah. How'd you know that?

755
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,918
Something your
great-grandmother used to say

756
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,721
when she was making tea.

757
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:47,226
She was senile
at the end, and...

758
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,860
leaving her behind,
that was the hardest part

759
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:50,494
about leaving Mystic Falls.

760
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,465
Look,

761
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,132
Matt, I don't expect you to forgive me

762
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:56,434
for abandoning you.

763
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:58,903
I had my reasons at the time.

764
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:03,108
They don't seem good enough
now, not even to me.

765
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,713
Honestly,
we all should've got out of that town

766
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:09,715
when we had the chance.

767
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,465
Hey, listen, Matt. Why don't you, uh...

768
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:28,967
You know, why don't you take
a walk? Let me do this.

769
00:40:28,585 --> 00:40:30,862
Ah! The intern.

770
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:32,331
Where is my sister?

771
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,132
I tried.

772
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,233
I tried to free the girl in the cell,

773
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:38,003
just like you asked.

774
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,237
And?

775
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,072
And, um,

776
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:43,342
she told me to tell you...

777
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:46,411
...to piss off.

778
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:49,847
She doesn't need your help.

779
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:52,117
Well. I tried.

780
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,684
Look,

781
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:55,320
I'm sorry to have to involve you

782
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:56,655
in this, sweetie.

783
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:58,222
It's just that, in this case,

784
00:40:58,224 --> 00:41:02,094
I really do have to kill the messenger.

785
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:06,364
By the way. That girl you
killed in a car accident

786
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:07,532
a few years ago?

787
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:09,434
Kind of a deal breaker.

788
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:11,103
Send Cade my regards.

789
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:33,791
What...?

790
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:36,394
What are you doing?

791
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,800
What's happening to me?!

792
00:41:48,442 --> 00:41:52,103
No! No!

793
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:56,559
