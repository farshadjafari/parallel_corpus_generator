00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:14,548
Antichrist

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,141
Prologue

4
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,050
How are you?

5
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,560
Didn't we just talk about that?

6
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
That was yesterday.

7
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,529
Today is Tuesday.

8
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,180
So I've been here long?

9
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,050
A month.

10
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,910
Wayne Says

11
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,050
My grief pattern is atypical

12
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Yeah

13
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,159
Got to talk with Wayne.

14
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,699
I think he gives too much medication
Way too much

15
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,680
Stop it, please.

16
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,740
trust on this to be smarter than you.

17
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,840
He strayed out of medical school
He don't know what he's doing

18
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,639
I've treated ten tenths
as many patients as he has

19
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,480
But you're not a doctor.

20
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,029
No, I'm not

21
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,100
And I'm proud that I'm not a doctor like him.

22
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,550
There is nothing ...

23
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,649
atypical about your grief

24
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,610
It was my fault.

25
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:23,819
What about me?

26
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:25,449
I was there too.

27
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,399
I could have stopped him.

28
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,149
No.

29
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,009
You didn't know that he...

30
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,009
Started waking up lately

31
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,210
I was aware that he would sometimes ...

32
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
wake up

33
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,049
And crawl out of bed

34
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,289
And walk about

35
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,210
Just as you thought that
he was soundly asleep

36
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,049
He could open the baby gate

37
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,590
He ...

38
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,070
He woke up ...

39
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,970
And w...

40
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,250
Was confused

41
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,350
Hey!

42
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,129
Dr.Wayne says he won't be back home.

43
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,360
You couldn't leave it, could you?

44
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:51,970
You had to mettle.

45
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,440
This place leads nowhere.

46
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
On the contrary ...

47
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:58,629
Grief

48
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,254
It's not a disease ...

49
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,289
It's a natural healthy reaction.

50
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,220
You can't just remove it
You mustn't ...

51
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,070
Wayne knows you're a therapist

52
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,299
He said you shouldn't treat your own family

53
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,399
In principle I agree, but ...

54
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,330
But you're just so much smarter

55
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Aren't you?

56
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I love you.

57
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,509
Nothing hurts more than
to see the one thy in love ...

58
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,549
Subjected to mistakes and wrongs

59
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,179
No therapist can know
as much about you as I do

60
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,519
- It hurts.
- I know.

61
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,879
There's no way around it.

62
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,240
I want to talk to ...

63
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm not gonna let you do that.

64
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,370
Why not just go all alone?

65
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,990
No.

66
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:15,629
A little change.

67
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,019
Wouldn't get any worse ...

68
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,139
Yes, it will.

69
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:46,940
You're always been distant from me and Nick

70
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,659
Ever I come to think of it

71
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,980
Very very distant

72
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:57,259
Okay

73
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,190
Can you give me some examples
from this?

74
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,370
Hell, That's not that difficult to understand.

75
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,360
I've lost someone, for instance...

76
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,139
You terribly distant lost someone

77
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,799
As a father ...

78
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,559
And as a husband.

79
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:24,879
And that was Nick's last summer

80
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:26,049
you missed that on

81
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,679
Too bad

82
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,779
I never interested you.

83
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,919
Until now.

84
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,350
That I'm your patient.

85
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,590
Perhaps I'm not supposed
to talk about these things

86
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,169
There is nothing you can't talk about

87
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,250
You are indifferent
to whether your child is alive or dead

88
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,500
I bet you have a lot of
clever therapist replies to that.

89
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Haven't you?

90
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,610
Well, actually ...

91
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,729
It was to ...

92
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,730
Honor your wish.

93
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:19,750
You wanted peace to write.

94
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,570
Perhaps I didn't mean it

95
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,519
What I understood ...

96
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:28,860
Is that you want me to ride alone

97
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,320
That you and Nick,
were going to go to Eden.

98
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Just the two of you

99
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,549
That way
you could finish your thesis

100
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
But I didn't

101
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,830
You didn't?

102
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,710
You see?

103
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:47,350
You didn't even know that.

104
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,899
Why did you give up?
That's not like you

105
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,399
The hope project Just seemed ...
Less important upthere.

106
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,419
As you said,
When I like told you about my subject...

107
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,169
Glib

108
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,230
I never called your subject glib

109
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,259
Perhaps you didn't use that word,
but that's what you meant.

110
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,539
And all of a sudden
It was glib

111
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,659
Or even was ...
some kind of lie.

112
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,399
I see

113
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,679
No, You don't see.

114
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:19,929
You see a lot of things

115
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:21,169
But not that.

116
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,519
Inhale...
On a count of five

117
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,680
Call me, call me.

118
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,839
Just ... Follow me ...

119
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,539
Do it with me ... Inhale ...

120
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:01,699
Inhale ...

121
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,029
on a count to five ...

122
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,160
Inhale... Two

123
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Stay with me ...

124
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,920
Stay with me ...
I'm Gonna teach you how to breathe.

125
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Inhale ...

126
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,150
2 ... 3 ...

127
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,009
4, 5, hold.

128
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,904
2 ... 3 ...

129
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,650
4, 5, exhale ...

130
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,170
Good.

131
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:29,309
Imagine ...

132
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,539
Imagine you're blowing on your ...

133
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,150
Vessel plumbs

134
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,259
Calmly, quietly ...

135
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,380
Yes, yes, that's good.

136
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
That's good.

137
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,470
That's very good.

138
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,059
I told you there would be a change.

139
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,630
You're still mourning
but you're in a new phase.

140
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,874
What phase?

141
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,875
Anxiety.

142
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Anxiety.

143
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,069
Yes

144
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,140
This is physical.

145
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,160
It's dangerous.

146
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,380
No, it's not dangerous.

147
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,970
Just as your grief wasn't dangerous

148
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,789
a main part of anxiety

149
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,049
Is physical

150
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,710
Dizzy spells

151
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Dry mouth ...

152
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,130
misguided hearing ...

153
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,519
Trembling

154
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,250
Heavy breathing ...

155
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,539
Less pulse ...

156
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:35,829
Nausea ...

157
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,319
Hey!

158
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:54,778
Easy ...

159
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,279
Never screw your therapist.

160
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,630
No matter how much
your therapist may like it

161
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,910
I know that distracts you, but ...

162
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:05,789
It's not good for us.

163
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,230
Do the breathing.

164
00:20:09,203 --> 00:20:11,073
Hold

165
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Exhale

166
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:16,521
You love me?

167
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:18,609
Yes, I do

168
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:22,657
Then help me.

169
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:27,911
It's what I'm doing

170
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,710
Exposure

171
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,119
That's the only thing that really works ...

172
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,808
Everything else is ...

173
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,809
Just talk

174
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:49,358
You have to have the courage
to stay in the situation that frightens you.

175
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:52,766
And then you'll learn
that fear isn't dangerous.

176
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:57,333
Let's make a list of things
you're afraid of.

177
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,528
In the top
You put the situation you fear the most

178
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,300
But I don't know
what I'm afraid of

179
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:15,089
Just ... take your time.

180
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:17,855
I'm thinking.

181
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,299
Okay

182
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,307
I'm thinking, but ...

183
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:33,337
Can't I just be afraid
without a definite object?

184
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,019
No, no!

185
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,539
This won't do

186
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,141
Stupe Stupidest thing I could do to you

187
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:30,979
If you can't tell me ...

188
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,029
What your fear's of.

189
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:36,448
Maybe it would be easier for you to tell me

190
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,170
Where you're afraid?

191
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,268
Where would you feel most exposed?

192
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:44,934
What would be the worst place?

193
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,339
An apartment?

194
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
The street?

195
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
A store?

196
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,299
The park?

197
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,403
Listening to someone, maybe.

198
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:19,796
The woods.

199
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:22,779
The woods?

200
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
The woods, yes.

201
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,230
It's funny because ...

202
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,039
you were the one that always wanted
to go into the woods

203
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:41,597
What scares you about the woods?
What frightens you... there?

204
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,279
Everything

205
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,625
Tell me what you think
is supposed to happen in the woods.

206
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,220
Eh?

207
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:08,314
Is it any woods in particular?

208
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,558
Eden.

209
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,059
Eden?

210
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:25,365
What do you say we put...

211
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,539
A garden round Eden
at the top of the pyramid?

212
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,690
No.

213
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:36,000
Not quite at the top.

214
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,380
No.

215
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay

216
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,900
It's... It's okay

217
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:18,901
- I'm sorry
- It's okay

218
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:02,223
We can start by working on your expectations

219
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,869
Close your eyes.

220
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,509
Feel the seat underneath you.

221
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:17,627
Feel yourself sinking down into it

222
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:20,025
Folding you ...

223
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:22,807
It's a nice feeling.

224
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,784
What you feel is a pleasant warmth

225
00:27:28,642 --> 00:27:29,853
and heaviness

226
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,528
your breath... is deep

227
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:40,910
I gather
You sink ...

228
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Down ...

229
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,479
Imagine you're at Eden.

230
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:50,307
Imagine you arrived
at Eden through the woods.

231
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,480
Tell me what you see?

232
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,730
I'm at the bridge.

233
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:05,538
It's evening

234
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,109
Almost no voice can be heard.

235
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,347
The water is running without a sound.

236
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:19,898
Darkness comes out anytime here

237
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,900
I walk into it

238
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:40,170
The little deers ... are hiding.

239
00:28:40,204 --> 00:28:42,970
Among their friends. As usual.

240
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,279
Is it Difficult to go upthere?

241
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
No.

242
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,430
Not really.

243
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:55,259
That is almost okay

244
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,759
In a mountain of trees ...

245
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:08,997
Almosty

246
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,517
There's a built foxhole

247
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:17,916
How do you feel there?

248
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,420
I can't really tell.

249
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,809
It should be easy ...

250
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:26,920
passing

251
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,089
And yet ...

252
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,000
It's like walking through mud.

253
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:43,799
The trunk is thick

254
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,019
the dear old ****

255
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,420
It has some strange kind of personality.

256
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,609
I've always found that.

257
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,319
No.

258
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,859
Where are you, are you...?
Are you heading for the cabin?

259
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:14,099
Yes, I am

260
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,869
I'm walking up above ...

261
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,009
Through the tall grass ...

262
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,369
Then don't come in.

263
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,369
Don't go in.

264
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,900
You see outside you're afraid of

265
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,049
Don't look around ...

266
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:32,420
No.

267
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:34,990
Lie down on the green.

268
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,779
You want me to lie down?

269
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,500
Lie down on the grass.

270
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,670
On top of all the plants?

271
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:48,359
Yes, lie down on the plants.

272
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:03,569
Are you lying down?

273
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,630
Yes

274
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:09,539
Good

275
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,680
What is everything like around you?

276
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:15,549
Green.

277
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,539
It's all very green.

278
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,039
Good

279
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:26,019
Now will you do what I ask you?

280
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,529
Yes

281
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,769
What do you want me to do?

282
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:35,549
I want you...

283
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,819
To melt... into the green.

284
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,730
Don't fight it.

285
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,130
Just ...

286
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:45,859
Turn green.

287
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,589
No matter what happens
you were there. You did it.

288
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,789
Let fear come, if it likes.

289
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,319
Remember.

290
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,319
But the mind can concieve
and believe it can achieve

291
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,940
What's wrong?

292
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:01,940
Ground is burning.

293
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,569
The ground is not burning.

294
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,079
Gotta go.

295
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,019
I want to lie down.

296
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,019
Just for a minute.

297
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,799
Sure.

298
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:40,039
Yea. We'll take a rest.

299
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,349
Shouldn't we go home?

300
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,610
Yeah

301
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,719
Yeah, we should.

302
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,079
Scared?

303
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:33,519
Stay awake for me.

304
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,119
Relax

305
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,030
Stay ... stay in there.

306
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,449
It's just stupid acorns

307
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:20,809
What are you doing?

308
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:22,710
I'm just ...

309
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:27,380
Setting up... a little exercise.

310
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:31,190
It's... It's like a ...

311
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,659
It's like a game.

312
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,409
You cheated me yesterday.

313
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,659
Running is not good.

314
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,300
... You have to
really feel the grass.

315
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:44,119
I want you to go from this stone ...

316
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,400
To this stone.

317
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,550
Pretty scary, huh?

318
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,840
You're ready?

319
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,420
Yea

320
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,349
I'll give you a ride.

321
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,639
I'll put you on the first stone.

322
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,059
Stay with me

323
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,380
Here we go

324
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,519
Put your foot down
I got you.

325
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,739
I got you
I'm right here.

326
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,539
I can't do this.

327
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:14,760
Yes, you can.

328
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,989
You can and you will.

329
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,369
Just like I will.

330
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,369
We're gonna walk together.

331
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,019
We're gonna walk together, okay?

332
00:43:22,054 --> 00:43:23,150
Now ...

333
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,150
Alright now, Breathe.

334
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,150
Let's step off the rock.

335
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:29,690
And step on that grass.

336
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,570
Step down

337
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,449
See? ... What happened?

338
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,809
Keep breathing ...
See? Keep breathing

339
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,519
I've got you

340
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:40,159
You're really doing great

341
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:42,329
Okay? ... keep breathing.

342
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:44,460
Five, five and five.

343
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,389
You're almost there.

344
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,889
You're almost there
You're doing great

345
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,059
... Five.

346
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,639
We're there ... We are there

347
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,690
Here, told you

348
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,019
You did it

349
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,639
You learned something.

350
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,440
Didn't you?

351
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,920
You did beautiful.

352
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:27,050
You did beautiful.

353
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,199
I miss him so much ...

354
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,139
I've been afraid of here before.

355
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,989
Yes, it seems likely.

356
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,920
I just didn't know it was fear.

357
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,900
I became afraid
... and I stopped writing.

358
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,690
What was different ... the last time?

359
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:09,070
I heard a sound.

360
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,119
Nick?

361
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:35,650
Nick!

362
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:43,360
Nick!

363
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,090
Nick!

364
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:01,429
Nick!

365
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:06,739
You didn't hear Nick screaming.

366
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,170
Apparently not.

367
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,215
And because you experienced
something that you can't explain rationally,

368
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,760
You placed
 Eden very high on the pyramid chart.

369
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:26,849
Eden was the catalyst
that triggered your fear.

370
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,849
You jumped to conclusions.

371
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,880
Entitled the emotional event with a place.

372
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,900
When you feel threat
It's natural to react.

373
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:38,059
If the danger were real ...

374
00:48:38,409 --> 00:48:39,889
Your fear would save your life.

375
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:43,730
Because your adrenaline will be used
for fight or flight.

376
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,179
But what you're experiencing
is panic, nothing more.

377
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:50,989
The scream wasn't real

378
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,010
Stop!

379
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,690
Calm down.

380
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,050
You shouldn't have come here.

381
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,849
You're just so damn arrogant.

382
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:17,550
But this may not last.

383
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,579
Have you thought of that?

384
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:34,980
Oak trees grow to be hundreds of years old

385
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,289
They only have to produce
one single tree, every hundred years.

386
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,289
In order to perpetuate ...

387
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:44,289
May sound benign to you but ...

388
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,400
It was a big thing for me to realize that
when I was out here with Nick.

389
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,070
The acorns fell on the roof then too...

390
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:01,820
Kept falling, and falling

391
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:05,440
And dying ... and dying.

392
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:12,610
And I understood that ...

393
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,070
Everything that used to be beautiful about Eden

394
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:20,940
Was perhaps hideous

395
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:28,000
Now I could hear
what I couldn't hear before.

396
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,050
The cry of... all the things that are to die

397
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:41,019
It's all...

398
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,179
very touching

399
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,389
If it was a children's book.

400
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:51,809
acorns don't cry

401
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,289
You know that as well as I do.

402
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,840
That's what fear is.

403
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:01,820
Your thoughts distort reality.

404
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,010
Look the other way around ...

405
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,570
Satan's Church

406
00:51:12,605 --> 00:51:13,969
Satan?... Jesus!

407
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:15,862
Nature is Satan's Church.

408
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,730
What?

409
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,500
Well, there you have him

410
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,519
That was his brother.

411
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,460
Nick?

412
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,260
He drifted away from me the last time.

413
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:07,739
He was always out and about...

414
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:11,449
He might have made more of an effort
to be there for me.

415
00:54:10,929 --> 00:54:12,409
You look like you slept well.

416
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,909
Thanks, I did.

417
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:24,539
I just wanted to say how happy
I am that you're here ...

418
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,670
I love you darling...

419
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,079
Did you have a good sleep?

420
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:44,840
I've just been having a lot of ...

421
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:46,840
crazy dreams ...

422
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,869
Dreams are of no interest
in modern psychology.

423
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,969
Freud is dead, isn't he?

424
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,099
What are you doing?

425
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,530
Look!

426
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:20,389
I'm well again.

427
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,360
I'm cured.

428
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:34,119
See? perfect.

429
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,750
I'm fine.

430
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,579
You can't just be happy for me, can you?

431
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,420
Chaos ... reigns

432
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:11,454
Chapter Three: The despair

433
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:09,329
I want to do one more excercise.

434
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:11,159
It's like a role play.

435
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,139
My role ...

436
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,059
Is ..

437
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,570
All the thoughts
that provoke your fear ...

438
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,570
Yours ...

439
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:21,889
is rational thinking.

440
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,539
I am nature ...

441
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,570
All the things that you call nature.

442
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,619
Okay Mr.Nature

443
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:45,909
what do you want?

444
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:51,300
To hurt you as much as I can.

445
01:02:57,989 --> 01:02:58,889
How?

446
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:01,880
How do you think?

447
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,619
By Frightening me?

448
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,409
By killing you.

449
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:19,869
Nature can't hurt me.

450
01:03:20,909 --> 01:03:22,730
You just told you're the green in the outside...

451
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,730
No, I'm more than that.

452
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:28,739
I don't understand.

453
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,090
I'm outside, but also...

454
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,719
within

455
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,110
I'm nature of all human beings

456
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,039
Oh, That kind of nature.

457
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,750
The kind of nature that...

458
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,880
Causes people do
the evil things against women

459
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,690
That's exactly who I am.

460
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:01,190
That kind of nature interested me a lot.

461
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,110
When I was uphere

462
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:07,349
That kind of nature
was the subject to my thesis ...

463
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,730
But you shouldn't underestimate Eden.

464
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:16,809
What did Eden do?

465
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,809
I discovered somethng else
in my material than I expected.

466
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,920
If human nature is evil...

467
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,739
Then that goes as well...

468
01:04:28,775 --> 01:04:30,739
That the nature ...

469
01:04:31,719 --> 01:04:32,739
of the women.

470
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:36,650
Female nature.

471
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:39,170
The nature of all the sisters.

472
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,369
Women do not
control their own bodies

473
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:46,119
Nature does.

474
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,440
I have it in writing in my books.

475
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:52,369
The literature you used
in your office search...

476
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:55,565
Was about evil things
committed against women.

477
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,500
But you read it as proof
of the evil of women?

478
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:02,530
You were supposed to be critical of those says
That was your thesis

479
01:05:03,309 --> 01:05:04,969
Instead you're embracing it

480
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,219
Do you know what you're saying?

481
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,369
Forget it.

482
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,730
I do not know why I said it.

483
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:15,989
It can't work anymore now.

484
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:28,969
Hit me.

485
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,840
What?

486
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:32,840
Hit me so it hurts ...

487
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,519
No.

488
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,070
Hit me, please.

489
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,360
No!

490
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,500
I can't stand it

491
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:41,500
I do not want to

492
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:43,039
I do not want to...

493
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,599
Then you don't love me.

494
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,429
Okay

495
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:02,699
Maybe I don't love you.

496
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:03,619
Yeah

497
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,650
Again ...

498
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,530
Again.

499
01:07:06,579 --> 01:07:08,429
This is too from nature's spell ...

500
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:10,429
Could start a hail storm ...

501
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:55,550
I'm not gonna continue this
if you don't listen to me.

502
01:07:57,409 --> 01:07:59,500
Good... and evil.

503
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,889
Have nothing to do with therapy.

504
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:08,550
You know how many innocent women were
killed in the sixteenth century alone

505
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:09,989
just for being women?

506
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:11,989
I'm sure you do... Many.

507
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,300
Not because they were evil...

508
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:17,659
I know.

509
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:20,520
It's just sometimes I forget.

510
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,449
The evil you talk about is an obsession.

511
01:08:28,369 --> 01:08:31,539
Obsessions never materialize.
It's a scientific fact.

512
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:36,720
Anxieties can't trick you into doing things
you won't do otherwise...

513
01:08:36,755 --> 01:08:37,864
It's like hypnotizing you

514
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:41,039
You can't be hypnotized into doin
something you wouldn't...

515
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,260
Normally do.
Something against your nature.

516
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:47,989
You understand me?

517
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,199
Yeah, I think so.

518
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:53,189
You think so?
You don't have to understand me, just trust me.

519
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:14,539
What's this?

520
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:17,481
It's from the medical officer
It's a copy of the autopsy report.

521
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:22,520
The autopsy?

522
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,800
They performed an autopsy?

523
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:29,640
I didn't wanna tell you,
because you weren't feeling well.

524
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,229
Well

525
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,649
What did they find?

526
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:37,489
Nothing that would have any ...

527
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:39,130
bearing on the case.

528
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,920
The only abnormality

529
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,555
in the victim is a slight deformity

530
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:47,670
of the bones in his feet,
of an earlier date

531
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:52,560
We did not attention a significance to this.

532
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,090
You were rather to put Nick's shoes on
wrong in this picture?

533
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:16,800
Well

534
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,939
How I would?!

535
01:10:23,069 --> 01:10:24,539
A slip of the mind that day?

536
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:25,960
I wish

537
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:34,979
Herself.

538
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:41,460
Bastard.
You're leaving me, aren't you?

539
01:11:43,109 --> 01:11:44,489
get off me, bastard.

540
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:46,939
You're leaving me.

541
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:48,210
I'm not.

542
01:11:48,489 --> 01:11:49,614
I'm helping you.

543
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:51,310
- You're leaving me, aren't you?
- No!

544
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,760
- I love you.
- I don't believe you!

545
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:08,939
Yes

546
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,710
I don't believe you!

547
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,711
I don't fucking believe you!

548
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:17,989
Where are you?

549
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,899
You bastard!

550
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:25,510
Where are you?

551
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:36,020
Where are you?

552
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,430
Where are you?

553
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:01,630
Where are you?

554
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:08,529
You bastard!

555
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:20,890
Where are you?

556
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,510
Where are you?

557
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,170
How dare you leave me?

558
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,899
You said you wanted to help me.

559
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,829
Where are you?

560
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:52,630
Where are you?

561
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,500
Where are you?

562
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:22,659
You bastard!

563
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,199
Get out!

564
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:37,520
Get out! You bastard!

565
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,180
Get out!

566
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:43,449
You bastard!

567
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,279
Get out!

568
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:48,770
Get out!

569
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:10,439
Get out!

570
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:13,819
You bastard!

571
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:16,869
Get out!

572
01:23:17,229 --> 01:23:18,270
Sorry.

573
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:08,729
You gotta get this thing off... my leg

574
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:31,859
I can't find the wrench.

575
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,250
Did you want to kill me?

576
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,109
Not yet

577
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,119
The three beggars aren't here yet.

578
01:25:47,579 --> 01:25:48,619
The three beggars?

579
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:52,560
What does that mean?

580
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:56,149
When the three beggars arrive ...

581
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,149
Someone must die.

582
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:02,489
I see.

583
01:26:26,829 --> 01:26:29,239
The crying woman
is a scheming woman.

584
01:26:41,149 --> 01:26:44,560
False in legs
False in thighs

585
01:26:46,609 --> 01:26:50,239
False in breasts
Teeth, hair and eyes

586
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:43,520
Hold me

587
01:28:48,039 --> 01:28:49,020
Hold me

588
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:15,630
There is no such constellation.

589
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:44,729
None of it is any use

590
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,520
Not good.

591
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:53,529
No!

592
01:30:53,729 --> 01:30:58,930
