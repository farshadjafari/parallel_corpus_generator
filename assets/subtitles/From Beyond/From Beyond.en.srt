1
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:50,460
Edward!

2
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:55,048
- Pretorious!
- Go away!

3
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:59,468
No, listen to me. I've got to talk to you.
The resonator - it's working.

4
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,307
If this is your idea of a joke...

5
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,019
No, listen to me. The new program - it worked.

6
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,603
Just like you said.

7
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,569
My God.

8
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:38,258
Ooh! Do you feel it, Crawford?

9
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,116
Turn it off. Edward! Shut it off.

10
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,659
Never!

11
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,495
Can't you feel it?

12
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,830
Crawford! In the mind.

13
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,085
The mind!

14
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,336
It's out of control. You've got to turn it off.

15
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,298
No! No!

16
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,425
No, I want to see more.

17
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,595
More than any man has ever seen.

18
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:28,182
Edward! It's running itself!

19
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,105
Something's...

20
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,442
...coming.

21
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,783
They're at it again.

22
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,161
With the coloured lights and the weird sounds.

23
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,620
Last time I called

24
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:53,207
you said you'd send a squad car
if there was another disturbance.

25
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,584
Well, I'm disturbed.

26
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,379
Hello?

27
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,505
Hello! Oh!

28
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,091
Agh!

29
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,968
Bunny! Come back!

30
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,012
Oh!

31
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,069
Bunny.

32
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,658
Bunny.

33
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,952
Oh, please.

34
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,112
Bunny.

35
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,867
Oh, Bunny.

36
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:14,206
- Bunny.
- Get back! It's out of control!

37
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:18,084
Edward! Turn it off! Edward!

38
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,435
Here we are, you little sweetheart.

39
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,692
Somebody! Help!

40
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,584
Help! Help!

41
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:09,718
Hold it, fella!

42
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,682
Oh God!

43
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:15,850
Oh my God!

44
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,810
Come on! Come on!

45
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:21,021
Bunny! Oh!

46
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,846
Dr Bloch, I'm Jordan Fields from the DA's
office. This is Dr Katherine McMichaels.

47
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,054
Hello.

48
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:02,392
I've read some of your work. Very... impressive.

49
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,186
Oh, yes. So is this facility.

50
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,938
Though if you've read my work...

51
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:11,567
you know I'm not in favour of locking away schizophrenics.

52
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,322
Yes, I know. You're in favour of
using them in experiments, like...

53
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,407
lab animals.

54
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,453
We've asked Dr McMichaels for her expert opinion

55
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:24,706
on the sanity of Crawford Tillinghast,

56
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:29,126
as it pertains to his ability to stand
trial for the murder of Edward Pretorious.

57
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,798
Thank you.

58
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,595
Er... Just a minute. Ray?

59
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,389
Oh.

60
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,191
Thank you.

61
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:52,650
And...

62
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,068
Oh.

63
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,875
I'm sorry. I am.

64
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,962
I'm sorry.

65
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,049
May God in heaven...

66
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,730
Get them out of here! Get them out of here!

67
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,330
He's in here, doctor.

68
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,009
Crawford?

69
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,890
This is Dr Katherine McMichaels.

70
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,058
Hello.

71
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:12,813
I suppose you're another psychiatrist.

72
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:15,567
- Yes, I am.
- Uh-huh.

73
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,568
And you're a physicist.

74
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:24,033
Your record at Miskatonic University was brilliant.

75
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,620
Oh yes. I had quite a future, didn't I?

76
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,249
Yes. You were working with Edward Pretorious.

77
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:38,130
I was assisting Dr Pretorious with his experiments, yes.

78
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,591
Mm-hmm.

79
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,719
What was the purpose of the experiments?

80
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,475
To stimulate the pineal gland with resonant vibrations.

81
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,434
The pineal gland? Why?

82
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:54,188
Dr Pretorious believed the pineal was
a dormant sensory organ.

83
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,775
- A sixth sense.
- Yes. Well, that's not a new theory.

84
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,486
The philosopher Descartes believed it was the third eye.

85
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:02,447
It's not a theory. It's a fact.

86
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,490
Then your experiments worked.

87
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,201
They proved the theory.

88
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,041
Yes.

89
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:14,793
Then what went wrong?

90
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,088
Nothing, at first.

91
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,217
But then we saw them.

92
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,720
What did you see?

93
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,390
We saw creatures.

94
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,394
We saw creatures, these...

95
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:44,905
...things that were swimming around
in the air and fill it all the time.

96
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:49,034
Are they around us now?

97
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,662
You bet.

98
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:55,165
Only we can't see them without
the resonator and they can't see us,

99
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,001
unless they're under the influence of the vibrations.

100
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:00,421
That's why I had to destroy it.

101
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,923
Destroy what?

102
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,842
The resonator - Pretorious's invention.

103
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,514
Because...

104
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,268
...it...

105
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,104
...came.

106
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,647
What came?

107
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,485
Dr Tillinghast?

108
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,155
Crawford, what did you see?

109
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,451
It ate him.

110
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,038
Bit off his head.

111
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,879
Like a gingerbread man.

112
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,634
Crawford.

113
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,761
- Dr McMichaels.
- I'm not mad.

114
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:52,849
I saw it.

115
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,187
Do you hear me? I saw it.

116
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,191
- Why doesn't anyone believe me?
- We can't reach him.

117
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,735
He keeps returning to the same fantasy.

118
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,486
Let's do a CAT scan on him.

119
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:10,408
Why? You've already seen everything you need to see.

120
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,410
There's always more to see.

121
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:20,043
No machines, please.

122
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,586
No, it's all right.

123
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,171
You'll be all right.

124
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,176
I promise.

125
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:44,609
Oh God.

126
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,278
No. No. No!

127
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,740
No! No!

128
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,366
No!

129
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,037
No!

130
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,337
Oh my God!

131
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,381
- There. Do you see that?
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,635
The pineal gland is oversized and
extending through the optic thalami.

133
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,221
Think the tumour is causing his delusions?

134
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,099
I don't think that's a tumour.

135
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,937
I think the pineal gland is growing.

136
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,190
- That's impossible.
- I know but the CAT scan bears it out.

137
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:27,067
The pineal stalk is elongating through the brain.

138
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,404
Wait a minute. I don't know from the inside of brains.

139
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,990
What does all this mean?

140
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,076
Well, it could mean that the experiment they were performing

141
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,995
actually does stimulate the pineal.

142
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,163
You mean he's not crazy?

143
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,750
I don't know.

144
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,919
He actually believes that he saw these creatures.

145
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:50,758
It still doesn't explain how Pretorious
died or what happened to his head.

146
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,513
I'd like to recreate their experiment

147
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,514
and I'll need Tillinghast to do it.

148
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,518
That is absurd and unethical.

149
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,564
I know your methods. The girl wonder.

150
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:08,567
You use your patients so you can make
your great discoveries.

151
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,194
At least here we try to cure them.

152
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,821
By locking them up?

153
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,782
Giving them drugs? Taking their lives away?

154
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,827
I can give him his life back.

155
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,289
I'll give you an expert opinion.

156
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,544
Crawford Tillinghast is a classic paranoid schizophrenic

157
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,755
and a dangerous one.

158
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,382
If I can recreate the experiment,

159
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:34,176
then I can find out what happened to Pretorious.

160
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,016
I'd like nothing better than to lock this guy up.

161
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,559
I've got a dead man with his head twisted off,

162
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,938
covered in some shit the pathologist can't even identify.

163
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,232
No other fingerprints found except Tillinghast's,

164
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,444
no blood on the axe, no blood anywhere.

165
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,949
I wanna know what the hell happened up there.

166
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,248
He's all yours.

167
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,178
You're my patient now, Dr Tillinghast.

168
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,558
Thank you.

169
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,104
I'll call for an appointment.

170
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:28,146
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

171
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,733
You've been released into my custody.
You have to come with me.

172
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,653
Where do you plan on taking me?

173
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:36,322
Back to the Pretorious house.

174
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,365
I want you to recreate your experiment.

175
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,493
No.

176
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,748
Look... You can either stay here for the
rest of your life or you can come with me.

177
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,292
That's not much of a choice, is it?

178
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,838
I believe you, Crawford.

179
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,215
I wanna see what you saw.

180
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:12,150
Hi! You must be Doc McMichaels.

181
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,317
No. I'm Dr McMichaels.

182
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,112
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

183
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,613
Then you must be...

184
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:20,199
- This is Dr Crawford Tillinghast.
- The crazy.

185
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:27,373
I'm Sergeant Buford Brownlee but
my team mates call me Bubba.

186
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,834
I used to play pro football.

187
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,002
We were all crazy.

188
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:07,622
Not exactly cheery.

189
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:37,442
Sorry about that. Childproof lock.

190
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,195
Last stop. Everybody out.

191
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,336
Dr Tillinghast, would you care to show us around?

192
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:48,972
Doctor, if you're telling us the truth,
the only way to free yourself

193
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:53,269
is to go back... through this door.

194
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,087
Come on, doc. There's nothing to be afraid of.

195
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,090
Look, I'll show you.

196
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,447
See? What did I tell you?

197
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:48,907
Bubba, you all right?

198
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,617
Yeah, yeah. OK.

199
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,494
Electrical cables.

200
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:58,709
We needed more power so... they rewired the whole house.

201
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,630
Where are the circuit breakers, doctor?

202
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:06,299
Doctor?

203
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:10,429
Tillinghast.

204
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,267
Damn! Have we lost him?

205
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:19,605
He knows this place better than we do.

206
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:23,192
First thing's to find the power.

207
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,376
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

208
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,255
I'll bet these cables lead to the resonator.

209
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,133
First we find our missing mental patient.

210
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,810
Agh! Agh!

211
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:07,193
I want more yelling.

212
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,374
This guy was into some weird shit.

213
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:25,296
Where's that mouth? I wanna kiss it.

214
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,423
That's him.

215
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:31,844
Dr Edward Pretorious.

216
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,478
I don't care about his private life.

217
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:43,749
The Pretorious resonator.

218
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,460
Agh!

219
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:52,090
- Is that how you hacked up Pretorious?
- That's where I hit it.

220
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,300
I knocked a fork off.

221
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,719
There.

222
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,846
There it is.

223
00:25:57,888 --> 00:25:59,472
What do you want me to do with him?

224
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,474
- Let him go.
- Are you crazy too?

225
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,435
He's reliving it - the night of the murder. Let him go.

226
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,648
DA says you call the signals.

227
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:18,826
Yes.

228
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:22,954
This is how it was.

229
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:33,173
That's where it ate him.

230
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:35,092
Wait a minute. What ate who?

231
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,306
We can start in the morning, Crawford.

232
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:44,768
I've started.

233
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,478
All right.

234
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:54,444
All this talk about eating is making me hungry.

235
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,697
How about we have some dinner, huh?

236
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,869
The real danger here is starving.

237
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,818
Ah!

238
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,979
Pretty, isn't she?

239
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:13,565
She is beautiful.

240
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:15,692
So how's it going, doc?

241
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,528
Need some help?

242
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,365
He used to bring beautiful women here.

243
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,163
They'd eat fine meals, drink fine wine, listen to music.

244
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,585
But it always ended with screaming.

245
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:40,509
And I would just lie there and listen to them.

246
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,762
Screaming.

247
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:48,057
Your boss had some screws loose.

248
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,934
He was a genius.

249
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:57,108
It's just that the five senses weren't
enough for him. He wanted more.

250
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,950
Is it finished? Are we ready?

251
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:07,118
Yes.

252
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,208
I, uh...

253
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,753
...had to bypass the computer

254
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,964
because the magnetic field erased the program.

255
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,926
And of course the monitor's completely useless

256
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,348
so the entire system has to be manually operated.

257
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,103
And unfortunately the resonator was so severely damaged

258
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:36,898
that I had to convert it to just an on-off system.

259
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,319
When we reach 20,000 MHz, we throw this switch

260
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:47,867
and a powerful magnetic field vibrates
these forks at a precise frequency.

261
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,828
Stimulating the pineal gland, allowing us to see with it.

262
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,705
Listen to me.

263
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,586
Don't move when we're in the field of the vibrations.

264
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:02,382
- Why?
- You move and they may see you. It...

265
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:04,425
will see you.

266
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,719
What is this "it" anyway?

267
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,430
Pray you don't see for yourself.

268
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:13,810
Now, I'm staying right by this switch.
If it appears, I'm shutting down.

269
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,230
Are you sure we're ready for this?

270
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:20,817
- Yes.
- Please...

271
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:25,404
Remember... Stay still.

272
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:00,440
This looks real great, people.

273
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:50,365
Oh, man.

274
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,000
What the hell is that?

275
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:05,087
- What?
- I don't know what.

276
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,339
No, don't move!

277
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,268
Holy shit!

278
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:21,730
Is this what you saw?

279
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,482
Yes. These things are around us all the time.

280
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,951
It's coming.

281
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:35,911
- Bubba, are you all right?
- No!

282
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,871
Lost a little piece, but I'll be fine.

283
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:40,457
When you move in the field it can sense you.

284
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,210
How far does the field extend?

285
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:45,002
I'm turning it off.

286
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,255
Crawford!

287
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,173
No.

288
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,968
Who is it?

289
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:52,719
Show yourself.

290
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,020
Welcome home, Crawford.

291
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,066
I'm glad you came back.

292
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:10,153
Who's the lovely woman?

293
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:13,198
It can't be you.

294
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:15,909
Dr Pretorious?

295
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:19,829
You have me at a disadvantage, my dear.

296
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,209
Crawford, where are your manners? Bring your friend to me.

297
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,420
- I saw you die.
- No.

298
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:31,258
Not die. Just pass beyond.

299
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,509
It was horrible.

300
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:36,971
A necessary rite of passage. Quite wonderful, in fact.

301
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,765
Where have you been hiding?

302
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:42,644
Move toward me, my dear. I want to see you.

303
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,692
- How? ...did I survive?

304
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:51,944
I am the master here.

305
00:33:53,905 --> 00:33:55,323
Is it...

306
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,162
Is it really you, Edward?

307
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:02,122
Touch me.

308
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:04,040
If it pleases you.

309
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,669
If it helps you understand.

310
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:46,875
It's just a body, but my mind is indivisible.

311
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,251
Bodies change.

312
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:21,201
That will be quite enough of that.

313
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,612
I feel exhilarated.

314
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,907
We almost died.

315
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:05,911
Incredible creature. It must have total
bodily control on a molecular level.

316
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:08,373
Yes, and Edward's mind.

317
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,626
He's become the thing that ate him.

318
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:15,797
Crawford, we saw the same things.
We've proved you're not insane.

319
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,007
I'm not so sure.

320
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,844
No. You faced your fear and you overcame it.

321
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,264
You saved our lives.

322
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,561
Yeah. I owe you one.

323
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:34,481
Want some breakfast?

324
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,903
How can you eat after that?

325
00:36:38,945 --> 00:36:41,697
Can't work without eating.

326
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,032
What work?

327
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:44,826
I've got to record the results.

328
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,411
The pineal gland was stimulated.

329
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:50,289
It gave me one hell of a headache.

330
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,375
Expansion of the pineal.

331
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,922
I'll have to do a study of the CAT scans of schizophrenics.

332
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:59,757
If there's a statistical correlation

333
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,052
between schizophrenia and an enlarged pineal, why...

334
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:05,804
they may be seeing or feeling what we saw.

335
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:09,684
Their minds may be influenced by those creatures.

336
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,896
Well, how about the hard-on I got?

337
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:15,940
Is there a statistical correlation for that too?

338
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:22,405
Well, um... We know that the pineal gland
helps to regulate the sex drive.

339
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:25,909
Perhaps pineal stimulation causes a...

340
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:30,454
an accompanying sexual stimulation.

341
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,373
There's so much to learn.

342
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,043
Well, we learned what we came for.

343
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:39,463
He ain't crazy and that... "it" ate Pretorious's head.

344
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,425
They're gonna think we're crazy but that's their problem.

345
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,679
Well, we just have to try the experiment again.

346
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,349
Did you say "we"?

347
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,936
Katherine, you can't.

348
00:37:52,978 --> 00:37:55,146
You don't mean go back up there now, do you?

349
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:58,148
You always run an experiment twice to check the results.

350
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,068
Wait.

351
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,070
I saw it get to him, Katherine.

352
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:05,532
Just exactly what you're feeling and it ruined him.

353
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,242
Pretorious.

354
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:10,619
Yes, I'd like to know more about him.

355
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,539
That resonator is a work of genius.

356
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:17,918
Were we in the same nightmare?

357
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:21,338
I mean didn't we just almost all get eaten by an "it"?

358
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,260
All it takes is a hand on the switch.
If it appears you make it disappear.

359
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:28,429
I got a better idea. How about if we disappear out the door?

360
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,806
Don't you understand? This is the greatest discovery

361
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,268
since Van Leeuwenhoek first looked through
a microscope and saw an amoeba.

362
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,396
Yeah, but he wasn't down there with the amoebas.

363
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:39,356
I have to find out if the pineal gland is really the key.

364
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,280
OK fine. Fine, but not here. Not now.
Under controlled conditions.

365
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:48,615
But we have control. No one knows
that resonator better than you do.

366
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,077
You're right, and that's why no one is touching it.

367
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,119
Crawford!

368
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:57,000
This could be the first step in curing schizophrenia.

369
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,336
Crawford.

370
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:05,215
My father spent 15 years in an institution - he died in one.

371
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,512
They called his condition incurable.

372
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:15,184
They tried everything. Drugs, shock therapy, even surgery.

373
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:19,313
But they turned him into a vegetable.

374
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,650
I'm sorry.

375
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:29,282
We can save so many others. Please, Crawford.

376
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,327
We can do it.

377
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,869
Help me.

378
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,246
Help you.

379
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:41,210
Help you to take your mind and shatter it?

380
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,050
I can't.

381
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:48,550
And I won't let you.

382
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,304
I'm the law here. You turn on that
machine, and it's reckless endangerment.

383
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:53,847
Look, we all need some rest.

384
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,768
Why don't we just get some sleep
and then we'll think about it.

385
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,853
Yeah, we'll get some rest and then we're going.

386
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,724
Turn it off.

387
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,434
No.

388
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,063
I have to see more.

389
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,275
Feel more.

390
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,735
Turn it off.

391
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,612
No.

392
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,429
No. No.

393
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,974
We've got to stop it.

394
00:43:23,016 --> 00:43:25,934
Oh! Don't stop.

395
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:33,192
I'm impressed, Crawford.

396
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,153
Do you realise now what I was creating?

397
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:39,114
Edward, my God, what have you become?

398
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,329
Myself.

399
00:43:46,664 --> 00:43:49,833
- Get the switch. I'll distract him.
- Ah!

400
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:55,213
Yes! I do find you distracting.

401
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,382
Don't! Crawford.

402
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,387
Listen to me.

403
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,809
Whatever you are, you're still Edward
Pretorious. You're still human.

404
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:09,728
More than human.

405
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:13,273
Join me, for ever.

406
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,945
Everyone must join me.

407
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,829
We'll be waiting for you, Crawford.

408
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:34,961
Where the hell are you going to now?

409
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,047
The circuit breaker. I've got to turn it off.

410
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,215
Damn!

411
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:41,010
Smell.

412
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:44,429
Taste.

413
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,201
In another life I would have enjoyed you in another way.

414
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,163
Messing with that damn machine again.

415
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:15,585
What the hell is that?

416
00:45:15,628 --> 00:45:17,922
The vibrations must reach down here.

417
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:23,010
I'll be right back.

418
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,476
What are you gonna do to me?

419
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,565
I'm going to kiss you.

420
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,135
Argh!

421
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:04,903
Ah!

422
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:44,235
I'm sorry.

423
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,534
I really thought that I could control it.

424
00:47:56,414 --> 00:47:58,875
It's changing us, doc.

425
00:48:00,126 --> 00:48:01,710
All of us.

426
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,170
And not for the better.

427
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:10,260
I was wrong to turn on the resonator
with other subjects present.

428
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:15,682
It's clear now that only one person
should run the experiment.

429
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,726
This ain't an experiment.

430
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:19,353
It's suicide!

431
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,856
The presence of other subjects causes
dangerous distractions.

432
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,108
Now, I can stand right at the master switch

433
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,528
and maintain control of that resonator
but I must do it myself.

434
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,199
I know this behaviour. I've seen it in the streets.

435
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:36,996
You may be a scientist, lady, but
right now you're acting like a junkie.

436
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,248
Oh, just take him and leave.

437
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,003
Wrap him up. I'll get the van ready.

438
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:51,969
Put some clothes on,

439
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,347
unless you want me to take you
kicking and screaming like that.

440
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:25,951
What the hell are you doing?

441
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,213
I told you to get dressed.

442
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:48,224
I did.

443
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:53,353
The van's ready. You going like that?

444
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,733
Oh.

445
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:06,699
What a shame.

446
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:13,706
I just... love what you've done with this room.

447
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:27,387
You're asking for it.

448
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:29,681
Mm-hmm.

449
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:44,822
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

450
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,949
Is that who you are?

451
00:54:50,577 --> 00:54:52,329
I don't know.

452
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:57,083
I don't know who I am.

453
00:55:08,262 --> 00:55:09,887
Listen.

454
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,018
- Crawford, we're leaving now.
- No, shh, listen.

455
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:17,438
The resonator. It's him.

456
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,400
He's trying to start the resonator from Beyond.

457
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,318
Son of a bitch!

458
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,500
Bastard!

459
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,844
Bubba, pull the cable!

460
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,525
Use the axe! The axe!

461
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:22,710
Damn!

462
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,902
Oh! Oh no, God!

463
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,742
Oh! God! Oh!

464
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,373
God! Oh!

465
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:05,253
No!

466
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,471
Bubba!

467
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,586
Katherine.

468
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,677
Agh!

469
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,889
- Agh!
- Crawford!

470
00:57:57,931 --> 00:58:00,099
Kiss.

471
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,394
Kiss, my dear.

472
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:17,367
Humans are such easy prey.

473
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:19,369
Let her go.

474
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:21,829
Oh, I will...

475
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,875
beyond her wildest dreams.

476
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:31,172
She will go into my mind and I will go into hers.

477
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:34,885
It's the greatest sensual pleasure there is.

478
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:38,764
You never knew pleasure or gave it. Only pain.

479
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,898
You are evolving into a being

480
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,985
that has never existed before.

481
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:55,780
I'm Crawford Tillinghast.

482
00:58:55,822 --> 00:58:58,367
Let it happen, Crawford.

483
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,659
No!

484
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:03,329
- Let it out!
- No!

485
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,001
Ah!

486
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,173
Crawford!

487
00:59:20,514 --> 00:59:23,057
Oh, it's so beautiful.

488
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:26,228
So...

489
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,065
...beautiful!

490
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,943
Now you can truly see.

491
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,987
What have you done to him?

492
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:42,159
I only awakened his sleeping pineal gland.

493
00:59:42,202 --> 00:59:45,746
It did the rest itself.

494
00:59:58,594 --> 00:59:59,802
No!

495
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,985
Crawford!

496
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:25,536
You whore!

497
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,585
Die, you fucker!

498
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:51,563
Oh, Crawford!

499
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,581
The police are here.

500
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,885
She's been telling us a pretty wild story.

501
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:07,139
I have been telling you the truth.

502
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,351
We'd like your opinion of her mental state.

503
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:15,146
I'd rather give you my opinion of her professional conduct.

504
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,983
You're contemptible.

505
01:02:21,945 --> 01:02:23,405
Look at her.

506
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:26,574
I doubt she even understands what she's done.

507
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,163
You cost Crawford Tillinghast his mind.

508
01:02:31,204 --> 01:02:33,414
Quite possibly his life.

509
01:02:36,293 --> 01:02:38,586
And another man's life.

510
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,092
That machine has got to be destroyed.

511
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,766
I listened to you the first time and
now I've lost one of my best men.

512
01:02:50,807 --> 01:02:54,561
The DA's going to chew me a new asshole, thanks to you.

513
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:58,023
She's in your custody now.

514
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:01,150
No, no, wait a minute. You can't lock me up.

515
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:03,695
Not here, please.

516
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:08,240
I can't do much with her in this agitated
state. She'll upset the other patients.

517
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,452
Do whatever you think best.

518
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:15,748
Listen, Dr Bloch, please.

519
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:21,295
You know that I'm sorry for everything that I've done.

520
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,800
You have got to let me go back.

521
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:28,177
Don't you tell me what I have got to do, girl wonder.

522
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,681
You always have all the answers, don't you.

523
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:36,686
Well, you're my patient now

524
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:39,396
and I've got a few answers myself.

525
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,025
Prepare her for electroshock therapy.

526
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,360
But... Dr Bloch...

527
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:47,614
- hospital policy says...
- Hospital policy dictates

528
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:52,034
that the nursing staff has to follow
orders. Now, do as I say.

529
01:03:52,077 --> 01:03:54,704
- Yes, doctor.
- No!

530
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:02,420
Stop her!

531
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:07,092
My God, Bloch! No!

532
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:10,594
Set her up in number five.
I'm going to go check on Tillinghast.

533
01:04:10,637 --> 01:04:13,347
If she continues to resist, sedate her.

534
01:05:36,222 --> 01:05:38,516
Please, don't do this.

535
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,351
It's not necessary.

536
01:05:40,393 --> 01:05:42,186
I'm all right now.

537
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,001
He's gone.

538
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:07,045
Call security.

539
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:44,748
Crawford.

540
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:47,001
Please don't eat those.

541
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:52,423
Delicious.

542
01:06:52,465 --> 01:06:55,760
They... can make you very sick.

543
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,193
Oh God!

544
01:07:18,074 --> 01:07:20,117
What is happening to me?

545
01:07:23,329 --> 01:07:25,123
We...

546
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:29,668
We don't know for sure but we're going to find out.

547
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:57,655
We're going to go in the hall now, Crawford.

548
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,112
Take it easy, honey.

549
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,119
Come quick. Something's happened and we need your help.

550
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,747
Wait a minute. What about her?

551
01:08:47,789 --> 01:08:49,832
Lock her up in her room.

552
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,556
Ugh!

553
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:30,998
Katherine?

554
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,421
Katherine?

555
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,164
I need a drink.

556
01:10:15,668 --> 01:10:17,753
Oh God! Let me outta here.

557
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:23,592
- You'd better hurry...
- Yeah, yeah.

558
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,677
...before he goes into DTs.

559
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,103
Oh, and get me a candy bar. I'm starving.

560
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,524
Harley.

561
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,320
Harley, what's going on?

562
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:48,201
Oh no! Oh, dear Lord!

563
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:50,244
Oh God! Oh no!

564
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:54,289
I saw... a snake.

565
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:59,002
A snake came out of its head and ate him. Dear Lord!

566
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:02,631
Shit, Harley, you son of a bitch, he's gone into DTs.

567
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:03,841
A long... A long...

568
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,010
Harley!

569
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:09,680
Oh, dear Lord! No, God!

570
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,516
Harley?

571
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,353
You all right?

572
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:26,072
That's the snake man! That's him!

573
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,789
Somebody! Somebody help me!

574
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,591
Help! Help!

575
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,904
Oh help! Somebody!

576
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,405
Help!

577
01:14:01,936 --> 01:14:05,105
Crawford! Stop!

578
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,274
Crawford, let me go.

579
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,109
What are? Crawford?

580
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,572
Crawford, stop!

581
01:14:13,823 --> 01:14:15,533
Ow!

582
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:20,537
Crawford, oh my God! Why are you doing this?

583
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:23,082
Because I love you, Katherine.

584
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,461
Crawford, we have to get out of here.
The resonator's going to blow up.

585
01:14:26,502 --> 01:14:28,087
I want us to be together.

586
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,421
Listen to me.

587
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,591
I set a timing device on a bomb. We only have a few minutes.

588
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,135
It doesn't matter.

589
01:14:34,177 --> 01:14:39,306
If Pretorious can turn on that machine
then he'll always have a way back here.

590
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:40,600
He's always here.

591
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:52,569
Don't you understand? He won't just influence us.

592
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,864
He'll devour us and the rest of the human race if he can.

593
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,574
You're so beautiful.

594
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,911
Please, Crawford.

595
01:15:01,078 --> 01:15:03,831
It won't hurt, I promise.

596
01:15:11,506 --> 01:15:13,341
Agh!

597
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,029
Crawford!

598
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,030
Help me!

599
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:43,078
Katherine?

600
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:45,122
Agh!

601
01:15:45,164 --> 01:15:50,377
Welcome, my dear. I've been waiting for you.

602
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,171
- Edward! No!
- Yes!

603
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:59,011
The greatest sensual pleasure there is
is to know the desires of another mind.

604
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,055
I know your desires, you impotent pig!

605
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:07,228
We are the most powerful being in the universe.

606
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:11,983
She'll know, Edward, how pathetic you are.

607
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,985
How you can't make love.

608
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:18,655
Maybe you could teach me.

609
01:16:23,744 --> 01:16:25,121
Crawford!

610
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:39,885
All right, come and get me, eunuch.

611
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,721
This time I'm not running away.

612
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:24,216
Katherine, run!

613
01:19:30,806 --> 01:20:08,594
Crawford!

614
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,015
What happened?

615
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:58,601
There was a big explosion near the top of the house.

616
01:21:12,408 --> 01:21:16,119
I've called the fire department.
They'll get you to the hospital.

617
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,413
Oh, my God!

618
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:21,250
What happened up there?

619
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:27,338
It...

620
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,926
...ate him.
