1
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,260
I mislike the feel of these woods.

2
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,320
Creatures that live in a unicorn's forest learn a little magic of
their own in time; mainly concerned with disappearing.

3
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,500
Unicorns?

4
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,870
I thought they only existed in fairy tales.

5
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,770
This is a forest, like any other - isn't it?

6
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,160
Then why do the leaves never fall here, or the snow?

7
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,690
Why is it always spring here?

8
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:44,990
I tell you there is one unicorn left in the world, and as long as it
lives in this forest, we'll find no game to hunt here.

9
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,760
Let's turn around, hunt somewhere else.

10
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,840
All right.

11
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,340
Stay where you are, poor beast! This is no world for you.

12
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,310
Stay in your forest and keep your trees green and your friends
protected.

13
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,440
And good luck to you, for you are the last.

14
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,820
I am the only unicorn there is? The last?

15
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:43,090
When the last eagle flies over the last crumbling mountain,

16
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:52,490
And the last lion roars at the last dusty fountain,

17
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:02,060
In the shadow of the forest, though she may be old and worn,

18
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,960
They will stare, unbelieving, at the last unicorn...

19
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:23,130
When the first breath of winter through the flowers is icing,

20
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:32,930
And you look to the north, and a pale moon is rising,

21
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:42,130
And it seems like all is dying, and would leave the world to mourn,

22
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:51,920
In the distance, hear the laughter of the last unicorn!

23
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,860
I'm Alive!

24
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,780
I'm Alive!

25
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:17,170
When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning,

26
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:26,760
And the future has passed without even a last desperate warning,

27
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:36,240
Then look into the sky, where through the clouds a path is torn,

28
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:45,910
Look and see her, how she sparkles, it's the last unicorn!

29
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,470
I'm Alive!

30
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm Alive!

31
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,500
That cannot be. Why would I be the last?

32
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,170
What do men know?

33
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,850
Because they have seen no unicorns for a while does not mean 
that we have all vanished! We do not vanish!

34
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,570
There has never been a time without unicorns.

35
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,270
We live forever.

36
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,560
We are as old as the sky, old as the moon.

37
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,940
We can be hunted, trapped; we can even be killed if we leave our
forests, but we do not vanish!

38
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,370
Am I truly the last?

39
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,460
Wave the flag for Hudson Highborn, show them how we stand!

40
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,510
I am a roving gambler; how do you do?

41
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,210
Hello, butterfly, welcome! Have you traveled very far?

42
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,800
How far would I travel, yessir! - to be where you are?

43
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,040
Clay lies still, but blood's a-rover. Red Rover, Red Rover, let
Charlie come over!

44
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,540
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?

45
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:43,290
My wild Irish rose.

46
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,700
Be a little respectful, butterfly! Do you know who I am?

47
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,980
Excellent well, you're a fishmonger!

48
00:06:49,630 --> 00:07:04,120
You're my everything, you are my sunshine, you're old and grey and
full of sleep, you're my pickle-faced, consumptive Mary Jane!

49
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,910
Say my name, then. If you know my name, tell it to me.

50
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,490
Your name is a golden bell hung in my heart.

51
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,710
I would break my body to pieces to call you once by your name!

52
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,620
Say it, if you know.

53
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,140
Rumpelstilstkin! Gotcha!

54
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,780
I should know better than to expect 
a silly butterfly to know my name.

55
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,160
One, two, three o'lairy!

56
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,290
Butterfly, in all your wanderings, have you seen others like me? 
Have you seen even one?

57
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,080
Oh, have you seen the muffin man, the muffin man, the muffin man?

58
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,040
Butterfly, even one? Tell me that you saw only one?

59
00:07:48,260 --> 00:08:02,620
One? One alone, to be my own... Up goes downwind, up go down! 
Go and catch a falling star...

60
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,740
It serves me right for even asking you.

61
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,060
All butterflies know are songs and poetry 
and anything else they hear.

62
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
I guess you mean well.

63
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,540
Fly away, butterfly.

64
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,040
Oh, I must take the A train,

65
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,220
oh, I am a cook and a captain bold and the mate of the Nancy brig.

66
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,280
Has anybody here seen Kelly?

67
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,180
I hope you hear many more songs.

68
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,220
I must find someone who knows me, who has seen others like me.

69
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,440
"Unicorn". Old French, "unicorne". Latin, "unicornis".

70
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,670
Literally, one horned: "unus", one, and "cornu", a horn.

71
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,760
A fabulous animal resembling a horse with one horn.

72
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,780
Visible only to those who search and trust, and generally mistaken
for a white mare.

73
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,250
Unicorn.

74
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,420
Oh, you do know me!

75
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,600
Please, all I want to know is if you've seen other unicorns like me,
somewhere in the world.

76
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,370
See you later, alligator! Close cover before striking!

77
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,100
Butterfly, have you seen the others? Where have they gone?

78
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,860
Tell me which way I must go to find them!

79
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,150
No, no, listen. Don't listen to me, listen.

80
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,600
You can find the others if you are brave.

81
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,920
They passed down all the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close
behind them and covered their footprints.

82
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,150
Red Bull? What is the Red Bull?

83
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,860
Hold tight. Hold tight. Hold tight, hold tight.

84
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,740
His firstling bull has majesty, 
and his horns are the horns of a wild ox.

85
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,640
With them, he shall push the unicorns, all of them, to the ends of
the earth.

86
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,950
Listen, listen, listen quickly!

87
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,240
I am listening! Where are the other unicorns, and what is the Red
Bull?

88
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,950
Listen, listen!

89
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,590
The king is in the counting house, counting out, counting out,
counting...

90
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,440
It's you or me, moth! Hand to hand to hand to hand to hand to hand...

91
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:26,500
He said I could find the other unicorns. But where? Or was the story
of the Red Bull just another of his songs?

92
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:35,860
Oh, I could never leave this forest. But I must know if I am the only
unicorn left in the world.

93
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,620
Suppose they are hiding together, somewhere far away?

94
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,850
What if they're waiting for me, in need of my help?

95
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,040
They passed down all the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close
behind them and covered their footprints.

96
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,020
I must go quickly, and come back as soon as I can.

97
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,120
You can find the others if you are brave.

98
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,220
Well, hello there, little one! Hello there, my dear!

99
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,220
And just who might you belong to?

100
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
A pretty little thing like you?

101
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,960
Come on now, good girl!

102
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Good Bessie.

103
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,630
Curry you up, clean you off, you'll be the prettiest old mare
anywhere.

104
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,410
Mare? Mare?! I, a horse?

105
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,920
Is that what you take me for? Is that what you see?

106
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,650
So, so, easy, easy, good girl.

107
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,170
What a pretty sight you are!

108
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,130
Feed you up, take you to the fair.

109
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,220
Come on, horse!

110
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,320
A horse, am I? A horse, indeed!

111
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,840
Now there's a horse!

112
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,380
My foot must have slipped.

113
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,720
I had forgotten that men cannot see unicorns.

114
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:12,790
If men no longer know what they are looking at, there may well be
other unicorns in the world yet, unknown and glad of it.

115
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:26,100
Horizon rising up to meet the purple dawn,

116
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:37,600
Dust demon screaming, bring an eagle to lead me on.

117
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:46,930
For in my heart, I carry such a heavy load.

118
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,810
Here I am, on man's road.

119
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,200
Walking man's road...

120
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,550
Walking man's road...

121
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm hungry, weary, but I cannot lay me down.

122
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:32,250
The rain calls, dreary, but there's no shelter I have found.

123
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:41,330
It will be a long time till I find my abode,

124
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:49,210
Here I am, on man's road.

125
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Walking man's road...

126
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:08,050
Walking man's road...

127
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,080
Well.

128
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,750
Well, bless my old husk of a heart.

129
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,170
And here I thought I'd seen the last of them.

130
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,950
Here, you two!

131
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,970
If he knew...

132
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,080
But I don't think I'll tell him.

133
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,540
He'll think it's a horse for sure.

134
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,270
Some wizard I hired.

135
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,210
Now just what in hell was that you stopped for?

136
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,510
What do you think it is, Rukh?

137
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,050
What do you see lying there?

138
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,460
Dead horse.

139
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,880
You're a fool!

140
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,680
But I knew that.

141
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,390
What about you, wizard?

142
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,180
What do you see with your sorcerer's sight?

143
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,020
Answer me, you juggler!

144
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,820
I - I see a horse.

145
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,900
Just - just a white mare.

146
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,490
I thought so. All right. It's a white mare.

147
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,070
I want her for the carnival. The last cage is empty.

148
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,930
We'll need rope.

149
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,300
The rope that could hold that mare has not been woven.

150
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,820
We'll make do with cold iron bars.

151
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,630
Oh, she's waking!

152
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,090
I'll cast a sleep on her!

153
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,310
Skagribbitch! Kastamangya! Nitchai! Nitchaul!

154
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,870
Now cage her. She'll sleep till sunrise.

155
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:51,760
This here is the manticore. Man's head, lion's body, tail of a
scorpion.

156
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,830
Creatures of night, brought to light!

157
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,850
Here is the dragon.

158
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,830
Breathes fire now and then - mostly at people who poke it, little boy.

159
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:17,210
Its inside is an inferno, but its skin is so cold it burns!

160
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,430
Speaks seventeen languages badly, and is subject to gout.

161
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,400
Creatures of night, brought to light!

162
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,740
The satyr.

163
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,520
Ladies, keep back!

164
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,030
I shouldn't be here. But quickly, tell me what you see.

165
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,830
Don't be afraid. Look at your fellow legends and tell me what you see.

166
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,280
What he calls a manticore looks to be no more than a shabby,
toothless lion.

167
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,490
And she has them believing that poor old ape with a twisted foot is a
satyr!

168
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,630
Illusions! Deceptions! Mirages!

169
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,990
Your Mommy Fortuna cannot truly change things!

170
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,330
That's true; she can only disguise. And only for those eager to
believe whatever comes easiest.

171
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,800
The Midgard Serpent.

172
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,450
It's got the whole world in its coils.

173
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,370
No, she can't turn cream into butter.

174
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,610
But she can make a lion look like a manticore to eyes that want to
see a manticore.

175
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,780
Just as she'd put a false horn on a real unicorn to make them see the
unicorn.

176
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,390
I know you. If I were blind I would know who you are.

177
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,830
Who are you?

178
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,300
I am called Schmendrick, the magician. You wouldn't have heard of me.

179
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,670
I entertain the sightseers as they gather for the show.

180
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,280
It's not much of a job for a real magician, but I've had worse.

181
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,330
That one is real. That is the harpy Celaeno.

182
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,170
Yes. The old woman caught her by chance, asleep, just as she took you.

183
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:22,740
Oh, she should never have meddled with a real harpy, or a real
unicorn for that matter, because the truth melts her magic, always.

184
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,420
She's going to free herself very soon now, and she must not catch you
still caged.

185
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,560
Go on, get away from there! You know what she told you!

186
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,360
Don't be afraid! Schmendrick is with you! Do nothing till you hear
from me!

187
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,860
The unicorn.

188
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,820
A unicorn!

189
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,540
I don't care how many damn spells you've got on her. Get rid of that
harpy!

190
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,080
I thinks about it all the time - what she's going to do to us!

191
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,770
Get rid of her, Mommy!

192
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,510
Fool, be still!

193
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,630
No other witch in the world holds a harpy captive, and none ever will.

194
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,980
I choose to keep her! I can turn her into wind if she escapes, or
snow!

195
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,620
Or into seven notes of music!

196
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,020
She's breaking through!

197
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:50,300
No. Not yet. Not yet. You're mine. If you kill me, you're still mine.

198
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:03,240
The harpy's as real as you are, and just as immortal.

199
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,800
And she was just as easy to capture, if you want to know.

200
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,800
Do not boast, old woman. Your death sits in that cage and she hears
you.

201
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:22,370
Oh, she'll kill me one day or another, but she will remember forever
that I caught her, that I held her prisoner.

202
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,080
So there's my immortality, eh?

203
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:37,020
Now, you were out on the road hunting for your own death, and I know
where it awaits you. I know him, that one.

204
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,240
Do you speak of the Red Bull? Tell me if you do, and where he is, if
you know!

205
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,730
The Red Bull of King Haggard. So you know of the Bull.

206
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,620
Well, he'll not have you. You belong to me.

207
00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:00,790
You know better. Keep your poor shadows if you will, but let me go.
And - let her go.

208
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,580
I cannot see her caged.

209
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,630
She is real, like me. We are two sides of the same magic. Let her go.

210
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,330
I'd quit show business first!

211
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,080
Do you think I don't know what the true witchery is, 
just because I do what I do?

212
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,130
There's not a witch in the world hasn't laughed 
at Mommy Fortuna and her homemade horrors -

213
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,790
but there's not one of them who would have dared!

214
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,480
The harpy and me - we are not for you.

215
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,880
Who are you for then?

216
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,380
Do you think those fools knew you without any help from me?

217
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,240
No! I had to give you a horn they could see!

218
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:48,690
These days it takes a cheap carnival trick to make folks recognize a
real unicorn.

219
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,950
But the Red Bull will know you when he sees you; so you are safer
here.

220
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,870
You should thank me for protecting you.

221
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,160
Schmendrick is with you!

222
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,210
I'm sorry, but I couldn't get away any sooner.

223
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:16,670
There has never been a spell on me before. There has never been a
world in which I was not known.

224
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,810
Oh, I know exactly how you feel.

225
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,670
It's a very rare person who is taken for what he truly is.

226
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,700
Will you help me?

227
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,990
If not you, no one. You're my last chance.

228
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,150
Can you truly set me free?

229
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,740
Mommy Fortuna doesn't think so.

230
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,000
She sees me as a clumsy fraud, a trickster.

231
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,580
But I am Schmendrick the Magician! - the last of the red-hot swamis!

232
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,240
And I too am real, like you, like her. Yes, I will help you.

233
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,350
Where is the other man?

234
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,430
Rukh? Oh, don't worry about him.

235
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,800
I asked him a riddle, and it always takes that lout all night to
solve riddles.

236
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,260
And now...

237
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Shara sineverel morlin sudai! Suni numira eddi subai!

238
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,780
I-I'm sorry, I would have like that to be the spell that freed you.

239
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,340
That's, uh, that's okay. Next one. Well, let's - try this one. Okay.

240
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,370
Urchulis sulai esumina gaminajo!

241
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,820
This is a super-spell.

242
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,950
Tha bars are now as brittle as old cheese, which I crumble and
scatter, so!

243
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,640
Whoouch!

244
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,450
Whoa, I must have gotten the accent wrong. It comes and it goes.

245
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,280
Try again. Once more. There's very little time left. Hurry!

246
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,000
Stop the bars!

247
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,120
No, no, [uh, serenin perenin] - ugh!

248
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,090
I dare no more. The next time, I might not be able to-

249
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:16,970
Try again. The spell was wrong, but there was true magic in it. Try
again!

250
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,450
My dear, you deserve the services of a great wizard, but I'm afraid
you'll have to be glad of the aid of a second-rate pickpocket.

251
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,030
Some magician! Some magician!

252
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,660
Ah, turn blue.

253
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,460
Hurry!

254
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,720
Step down, lady! You are free!

255
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:54,020
Okay, Schmendrick, I give up. Why is a raven like a writing desk?

256
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,990
The cage. You have taken my keys.

257
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,480
Why, you thin thief.

258
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:14,120
She'll string you on barbed wire to make a necklace for the harpy!

259
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,120
Run!

260
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,020
You pile of stones! I'll set all your toenails growing in when you
mess with me!

261
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:44,580
Some magician. You couldn't turn cream into cheese, you Schmendrick
you!

262
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,940
No, she'll kill you! Run, she'll kill you if you set her free!

263
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:23,180
Set me free. We are sisters, you and I.

264
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:13,230
Not alone! You never could have freed yourselves alone! I held you!

265
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,050
Run, run, run, run away from here, now!

266
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,370
No. Come with me. Come with me.

267
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,740
Don't look back, and don't run.

268
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,750
You must never run from anything immortal, it attracts their
attention.

269
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,030
Oh, that poor old woman - I didn't want her to - I didn't know -

270
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,720
She chose her death long ago. It was the fate she wanted.

271
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,320
And you, you have no regrets, as I do?

272
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,890
I can never regret. I can feel sorrow, but it's not the same thing.

273
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,030
Where will you go now?

274
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:29,040
I am looking for others like me. Have you seen them, magician?

275
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,740
No, I've never seen anyone like you. Not while I was awake, anyway.

276
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,820
A butterfly told me of a Red Bull, who pushed all the other unicorns
to the ends of the earth.

277
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,840
And Mommy Fortuna spoke of a King Haggard.

278
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,410
So I'm going where they are, to learn whatever they know.

279
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,960
Take me with you, for luck, for laughs, for the unknown.

280
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:58,730
You may come with me if you like, though I wish you'd asked for some
other reward for having freed me.

281
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,970
Well, I thought about it, but you could never have granted my true
wish.

282
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,720
No. I cannot turn you into something you are not.

283
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,420
I cannot turn you into a true magician.

284
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,310
That's all right, don't worry about it.

285
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,310
I'm not.

286
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,930
What do you know of King Haggard?

287
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,350
I have heard that he's an old man who rules over barren country by
the sea.

288
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:28,210
Some say that Haggard's land was green and soft once, before he came,
but the minute he touched it, it became hard and grey.

289
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,580
Tell me about the Red Bull.

290
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,690
The Red Bull?

291
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,840
I've heard too many tales, to tell you the truth.

292
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,600
I've heard - I've heard that the Bull is real, that the Bull is a
ghost.

293
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,490
Sorry.

294
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,170
I've heard that the Red Bull protects Haggard or else that he keeps
him a prisoner in his own castle - there are so many stories.

295
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,280
They passed down all the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close
behind them and covered their footprints.

296
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,200
Want one?

297
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,980
How much further is it?

298
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,960
This is the edge of Haggard's kingdom.

299
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,370
It's very, very dangerous country.

300
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,880
Mommy Fortuna never came within miles of here.

301
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,300
Listen!

302
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,830
Oh, oh, I was afraid of that.

303
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,740
Run, swiftly, hide yourself! We'll find each other later!

304
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,770
Why? Who are they?

305
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,410
Outlaws!

306
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,420
Whoa! Well, what have we here?

307
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,170
Hi, lads! Mind your heads now! It's raining ninnies!

308
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,260
Rat soup. Again rat soup.

309
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,280
At least she could use a different rat. The third night, anyway.

310
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,620
Put me down, you fool!

311
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,910
Aye, lad, quiet there. You're for Captain Cully himself, you are.

312
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,470
Well, Jack Jingly! And who is it you bring us, comrade or captive?

313
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,940
I dunno what he is maself.

314
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,330
What happened, Cully?

315
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,410
We were out looking for likely travelers, like always.

316
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,280
Add some more water to the soup, love! There's company!

317
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,570
I'll not have it, Cully!

318
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,730
Not another mouth to feed! The soup's no thicker than sweat as it is!

319
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,600
My love, where's your greenwood hospitality?

320
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,920
And who's this long lout?

321
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,200
I don't like the look of him. Slit his wizard.

322
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,510
I wouldn't do that, because I am Schmendrick the Magician!

323
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,580
And you, sir, you must be the famous Captain Cully, boldest of the
bold and freest of the free!

324
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,740
That I am.

325
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,280
He's guessing, Cully, gut him, before he does you the way the last
one did!

326
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Well, that's only Molly Grue's way.

327
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,090
But she has a good heart, a good heart.

328
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,990
Off with you.

329
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,430
And this lady, don't tell me, she must be your faithful and beautiful
companion.

330
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,200
Maybe he does know.

331
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,150
Yes, splendid woman.

332
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,250
You are welcome here, sorceror.

333
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:44,670
Come to the fire and tell me what you've heard of dashing Captain
Cully and his band of freemen. Have a taco.

334
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,270
You're a lucky guest this evening, magician.

335
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:05,520
My minstrel, Willy Gentle, here, was just about to inspire us by
singing one of the adventures of bold Captain Cully and his men.

336
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,640
Nay, Willy! Not that thing again!

337
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:18,000
Willy! Sing us a true song! Sing us one about Robin Hood!

338
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,590
There is no Robin Hood! Robin Hood is a myth!

339
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,040
Magic, do as you will.

340
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,100
Magic, magic, do as you will.

341
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,800
And now, lads, with that out of the way -

342
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,780
Look! Oh, look there!

343
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:12,680
Sir, madam, I welcome you to my domain! My name is Captain Cully, of
the greenwood!

344
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,110
Oh, Robin! And Marion!

345
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:29,960
Friar Tuck! That's Friar Tuck there! Will Scarlett...

346
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,220
What is this? This is not happening!

347
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,380
Robin Hood is a myth! We are the reality!

348
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,530
Magic is magic, but the truth is us! Right?

349
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:59,160
Robin! Mr. Hood, sir! Little John! Will! Wait for me! Robin! Marion!

350
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,850
Wait! Wait for me! Marion!

351
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,520
It worked! It worked! I said "Magic, do as you will", and it worked!

352
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,340
That was a dangerous diversion, Sir Sorceror.

353
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:25,910
He's no ordinary hedge wizard, Cully. 
I don't know what he is, ta tell you the truth.

354
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,930
Tie him up, and do you guard him tonight, Cully.

355
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,430
And in the morning, we'll see what's to be done with a wizard who can
call up Robin Hood!

356
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,360
Should be worth something, eh, Cully?

357
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,300
Yes indeed! We'll sell him! We'll both be gentlemen of leisure in a
month's time!

358
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,460
I don't even care!

359
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,100
Gotonius basni varsinisn basti gumtina crosti stormily hasti!

360
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:15,830
Oh. Oh. Oh, I love you.

361
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,270
I love you. Love love love love love love love love love.

362
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,820
Oh, what have I done?

363
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,770
Always, always.

364
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,910
Faithfulness beyond any man's deserving.

365
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:35,480
I will keep the color in your eyes when no other in the world
remembers your name.

366
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:41,840
There is no immortality but a tree's love.

367
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,480
Oh, no, I'm engaged to a Douglas fir. Help, unicorn, where are you?!

368
00:37:51,850 --> 00:38:03,090
Ooh, galls and fireblight! She shall never have you, the hussy! We
will perish together!

369
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,940
Did you see me? Were you watching, did - did you see what I made?

370
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,820
Yes. It was true magic.

371
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,960
Yeah. It's gone now, but I-I had it. It had me, but it's gone. I-I
couldn't hold it.

372
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,930
Leaving us so early, magician?

373
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,380
No. Can it truly be?

374
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,470
Where have you been? Where have you been?

375
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,050
Damn you, where have you been?!

376
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,790
Don't you talk to her that way!

377
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,190
I am here now.

378
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,520
Oh? And where were you twenty years ago, ten years ago?

379
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,700
Where were you when I was new?

380
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,070
When I was one of those innocent, young maidens you always come to?

381
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:15,860
How dare you, how dare you come to me now, when I am this?

382
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,590
Can you really see her? Do you really know what she is?

383
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,050
If you had been waiting to see a unicorn as long as I have...

384
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,150
She's the last unicorn in the world.

385
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,280
It would be the last unicorn in the wourld that came to Molly Grue.

386
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,910
It's all right. I forgive you.

387
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,550
Well, it's time for us to go now.

388
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,030
I'm ready.

389
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,180
You can't come with us! We're on a quest!

390
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,910
Can't I? Ask her.

391
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,610
Never! I, Schmendrick the Magician, forbid it!

392
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:01,350
And be wary of wousing a wizard's wrath - rousing a rizard's - rou -

393
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,850
Be wary of making a-a magician angry! If I chose I could turn you
into a frog -

394
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,590
I should laugh myself sick. Have sense, man.

395
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,840
What were you going to do with the last unicorn in the world - keep
her in a cage?

396
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,750
Oh, you don't even know where we're going!

397
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,520
Do you think it matters to me?

398
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,830
We are journeying to King Haggard's country to find the Red Bull!

399
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,360
Well, you're going the wrong way.

400
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,310
I'm sorry, but you were going the wrong way, magician.

401
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,650
Well, it was a shortcut.

402
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,190
Haggard's fortress. We'll be there tomorrow if we walk all night.

403
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:54,280
Where does King Haggard keep the Red Bull?

404
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:00,600
I have heard that he roams at night and lies up by day in a great
cavern beneath the castle - but we'll know soon enough.

405
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,820
Moon rising, disguising

406
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:14,070
Lonely streets in gay display

407
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,360
The stars fade, the nightshade

408
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,760
Closing makes the world afraid.

409
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,610
It waits in silence for the sky to explode.

410
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:42,210
Here I am, on man's road.

411
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,520
Walking man's road...

412
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,830
Schmendrick, the light!

413
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,360
Do something!

414
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,150
He's driving her! He can't want to kill her 
or-or he would have done it by now!

415
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,730
He's driving her the way he drove the others - to the castle, to King
Haggard.

416
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,870
Please! Please do something!

417
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,770
What can I do? Do you think the Red Bull likes card tricks?

418
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,520
If I could I'd change her into some other creature, some beast too
humble for the Bull to be concerned with.

419
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,600
But that would take a real magician, with real magic - and I can't
pretend any more.

420
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,130
But you do. You have magic.

421
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,610
Maybe you can't find it, but it's there.

422
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,530
You called Robin Hood, and there is no Robin Hood.

423
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,320
You have all the power you need, if you dare to look for it.

424
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,790
Please! It's not fair!

425
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,240
Run! Run, now! Run!

426
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,310
Schmendrick!

427
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,580
Magic, magic, do as you will.

428
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,120
What have you done?

429
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,630
What have you done? What have you done?!

430
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,720
What do you mean, what have I done?

431
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,350
Only saved her from the Red Bull by magic, that's all I've done!

432
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,070
By magic! By my own true magic!

433
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,660
Doubtless you are wondering how I plan to return her to her proper
shape. Wonder not.

434
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,920
The power will come to me whenever I need it. And one day, one day it
will come to me when I call!

435
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,550
You were right! You were right.

436
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,920
I didn't know you meant to turn her into a human girl!

437
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,890
The Red Bull came for a unicorn, so she had to become something else.

438
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:54,210
The magic chose the shape, not I. I am a bearer! I am a dwelling! I
am a messenger!

439
00:45:54,210 --> 00:46:00,850
You are an idiot! Do you hear me? You lost her! You trapped her in a
human body! She'll go mad!

440
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,050
I can change her back. Don't worry about it. I-I can change her back.

441
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,730
What have you done to me?

442
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,380
Oh, no. Oh, please, no!

443
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,350
You see, I couldn't think of anything else I could do to save you.

444
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:44,330
What have you done to me? I'm a unicorn! I'm a unicorn!

445
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,480
Don't! Don't you hurt yourself!

446
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,690
Be still! The magic knew what it was doing.

447
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:54,930
In this shape alone you have some hope of reaching King Haggard and
finding out what has become of the other unicorns.

448
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:00,550
I wish you had let the Red Bull take me. I wish you had left me to
the harpy!

449
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,820
I can feel this body dying all around me!

450
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,570
But - but it's only for a little while, I promise you!

451
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,110
Soon you'll have your true shape again, forever!

452
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,210
Why not now?

453
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,140
Schmendrick, you can't let her stay like this, you can't possibly!

454
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:16,900
Why not?

455
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,200
Unless you think you could defeat the Bull if you met him again.

456
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:30,680
No. And I'm afraid of this human body - more than I was of the Red
Bull - afraid!

457
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,190
A man, and two women, coming here?

458
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,910
The young girl - she looks so strange. She has a newness to her.

459
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,000
Give your names.

460
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,200
I am Schmendrick, the Magician.

461
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,030
This is Molly Grue, my helper, and this, this is - this is...

462
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,910
the Lady Amalthea.

463
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,990
We seek audience with King Haggard.

464
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,030
State your business with King Haggard.

465
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,330
I will, but to King Haggard himself.

466
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,150
No, no, it's all right, don't be afraid. It's just the Bull.

467
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,520
This is King Haggard's throne room.

468
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,850
Throne room? This is a cell. This is a tomb. Take us to King Haggard!

469
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:58,060
I am King Haggard. This is Prince Lir, my son.

470
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,790
Hi. Glad to meet you.

471
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,330
What is your concern with me?

472
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,750
We seek, Sire, to enter your service.

473
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,330
I need no servants.

474
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:10,450
Oh, but surely, Sire, a magician, a fine cook, a -

475
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,960
You are losing my interest, and that is very dangerous.

476
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,560
My "court" consists of four men-at-arms.

477
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Four? But the pleasures of the court, Sire, the music, the talk, the
hunts and the balls and the great feasts -

478
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:31,950
They are nothing to me. I have known them all, and they have not made
me happy.

479
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,400
I will keep nothing near me that does not make me happy!

480
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,160
I also keep one magician.

481
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,290
Oh, a magician, huh? What's his name?

482
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:49,950
He is called Mabruk. He is known in his trade as "the magician's
magician".

483
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:56,630
I can see no reason at all to replace him with some vagrant,
nameless, clownish -

484
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,390
I can. He doesn't, this marvelous Mabruk, doesn't make you happy.

485
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,790
Molly, be still.

486
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,660
And how would you know?

487
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,730
Well, just look at you!

488
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,400
Molly!

489
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,580
Did you hear that, Mabruk?

490
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,320
What does your majesty wish of me?

491
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,550
Schmendrick, my dear boy, how nice to see you!

492
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:26,790
He has come to take your place. He is now my royal magician.

493
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,550
See?

494
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,140
Shhh!

495
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:33,510
The legendary Schmendrick? "The Runeless Wonder?"

496
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,380
I realize your majesty is a great collector of - oddities, but-

497
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,020
The woman is right. A master magician has not made me happy.

498
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,200
I will see what an incompetent one can do. You may go, Mabruk.

499
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,610
I am not packed off as easily as that!

500
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,720
Come on, old man. I'll write you a reference.

501
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,480
Haggard, I would not be you for all the world!

502
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:36,700
You have let your doom in by the front door, but it will not depart
that way!

503
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:42,490
Farewell, poor Haggard! Farewell...

504
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,560
Don't!

505
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,730
I will not touch you. What are you looking at?

506
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:53,950
The sea.

507
00:51:54,330 --> 00:52:00,050
Ah, yes. The sea is always good.

508
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:06,640
There is nothing that I can look at for very long, except the sea.

509
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,140
What is the matter with your eyes? Why can I not see myself in your
eyes?

510
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,170
Who is she?!

511
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,690
Oh, your majesty, the Lady Amalthea is my niece -

512
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,490
I want to know who she is!

513
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,380
Father, what difference does it make? She's here!

514
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,020
For once, you are right. She is here. They are all here.

515
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:40,900
And whether they mean my doom or not, I will look at them for a while.

516
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,500
You may come and go as you please. My secrets guard themselves.

517
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:52,200
Will yours do the same?

518
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,210
Say, I know where there's some cloth, fine satin.

519
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,030
We could make a dress.

520
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,630
Please, lady, let me help you. What can I do for you? Trust me!

521
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:13,630
In the sea,

522
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,010
The fish have learned to fly,

523
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:25,080
On a moonlit night,

524
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,460
On wings of silver,

525
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,200
As the enchanted stars

526
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,810
Sail serenely by.

527
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,650
Do they know

528
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:51,590
Where do unicorns go?

529
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:58,020
Where winged horses fly?

530
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,540
Narwhals lost at sea

531
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,450
And never seen again.

532
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:18,250
Go, go and ask the magpie,

533
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,570
"Where do unicorns go?"

534
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,360
In the trees,

535
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,640
The birds have learned to speak,

536
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,870
Many-colored,

537
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,950
They keep their secrets

538
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,260
In a parade of clouds

539
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,680
Playing hide and seek.

540
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:05,880
Do they know,

541
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:10,660
Where do unicorns go?

542
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:17,660
Where winged horses fly?

543
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:23,240
Narwhals lost at sea,

544
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,900
And never seen again.

545
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:37,590
Does myth and mystery lie

546
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:45,200
Where the unicorns go?

547
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:00,720
Ow. Mm. And then, she looked at me, and I was sorry I had killed the
thing.

548
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,440
Sorry for killing a dragon. Imagine - Ow!

549
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,770
Cut away from yourself, not toward.

550
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,590
You know, your highness, I really think you should try something else.

551
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,990
But what's left on earth that I haven't tried?

552
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,390
Giants, ogres, black knights, terrible tasks, fatal riddles!

553
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,030
Molly, for her sake I've become a hero, but my great deeds mean
nothing to her!

554
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,990
Then perhaps the Lady Amalthea is not to be won by great deeds!

555
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,400
Who is she, Molly? Where does she come from?

556
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,320
I don't know any more about her than I did the first day she came
here.

557
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,050
Your highness-

558
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:44,510
Except that I wish to serve her, as you do, to help her find whatever
she has come here to find.

559
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,760
I wish to be whatever she has most need of.

560
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,950
Will you tell her so?

561
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:51,670
I think if you told her yourself-

562
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,820
But she never speaks to me, Molly! Not a word, not a word in all this
time!

563
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,400
You are cruel to him.

564
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,380
You might give him a gentle word, at the very least. He only wishes
you to think of him.

565
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:08,950
Molly?

566
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,060
Who am I? Why am I here?

567
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,870
What is it that I am seeking in this strange place, day after day?

568
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,170
I-I knew a moment ago, but I-I have forgotten.

569
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,780
The unicorns. If you are not the last...

570
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,280
Once, I can't remember,

571
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,140
I was long ago,

572
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,550
Someone strange,

573
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,940
I was innocent and wise,

574
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:52,660
And full of pain.

575
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:58,870
Now that I'm a woman,

576
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,490
Everything is strange.

577
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,910
I must go to him.

578
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:14,200
I must face the Bull again and discover what he has done with them,
before I forget myself forever.

579
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:20,380
But I don't know where to find him. And I'm lonely.

580
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:30,140
Once, when I was searching

581
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,500
Somewhere out of reach,

582
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,910
Far away,

583
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,080
In a place I could not find

584
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,410
Or heart obey,

585
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:55,400
Now that I'm a woman,

586
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:01,220
Everything has changed,

587
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,790
Everything has changed,

588
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:17,430
Everything has changed.

589
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,730
Schmendrick will find a way down to the Red Bull. He has been
searching every day.

590
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:29,680
I hope for no help from him. He's no magician now, but the king's
poor clown.

591
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,130
He's doing it for you!

592
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,660
He plays the fool for Haggard, trying to divert him from wondering
what you are.

593
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,350
You do wrong to mock him.

594
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,290
Forgive me.

595
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:40,140
My lady!

596
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,360
The Bull be going out.

597
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:53,630
He goes out every sundown to hunt for the strange white beast that
escaped him.

598
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:58,380
You know that perfectly well, so don't be stupid.

599
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:06,720
Har-har. So that be a unicorn! She is very beautiful.

600
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,820
How do you know she's a unicorn?

601
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:18,840
No cat out of its first fur can ever be deceived by appearances.
Unlike human beings, who seems to enjoy it.

602
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,910
Ye have very little time.

603
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:28,180
Soon there'll be a human woman in that body and no unicorn at all
ever again.

604
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,630
It may be that she'll marry the good prince, who loves her.

605
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:41,280
Oh. Oh, purr, purr. Do that. Yes. That be nice.

606
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,770
No. No, that cannot be. She is the last.

607
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:52,160
Well, then, she must do what she came to do. She must take the king's
way down to the Red Bull.

608
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,730
Is there a way? Tell me the way. Tell me where we must go!

609
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,110
Avast! Hark ye closely, mum.

610
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:08,250
When the wine drinks itself, when the skull speaks, when the clock
strikes the right time.

611
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:14,160
Only then will you find the tunnel that leads to the Red Bull's lair,
har har.

612
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,540
There be a trick to it, of course.

613
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,240
Why won't you help me? Why must you always speak in riddles?

614
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,790
Because I be what I be.

615
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:33,610
I would tell you what you want to know if I could, mum, but I be a
cat, and no cat anywhere ever gave anyone a straight answer, har har.

616
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,760
I can't do this very much longer. He had me juggling teacups for him
all night long.

617
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,670
Teacups! With tea in them!

618
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,090
Schmendrick, I didn't tell you. I found the skull!

619
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:05,960
The one the cat was talking about. It's up on a pillar in the Great
Hall. And the clock -

620
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,730
Molly, he knows. King Haggard knows what Lady Amalthea is, I'm sure
of it.

621
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,780
What can we do?

622
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,460
Molly?

623
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:16,010
I've practically got the whole poem now, if you wanted to look at it.

624
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,960
Oh! Yes, of course, your highness. Whatever you like.

625
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:45,340
The lift of longing, the crash of loss, the bitterness of - cross?
Boss? Moss? Damn!

626
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,830
Good evening, my lady.

627
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:49,750
Who are you?

628
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,290
I'm Lir. Don't you know me? I'm Lir.

629
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:56,430
Lir. Prince Lir.

630
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,950
You were dreaming, my lady.

631
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,470
Well, I'm always dreaming, even when I'm awake.

632
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:07,650
It is never finished. I-I will not trouble you, my lord prince.

633
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,370
Trouble me! Please, trouble me!

634
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:16,230
I would court you with more grace if I knew how. 
I wish you wanted something with me.

635
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:22,930
Drown out my dreams. Keep me from remembering 
- whatever wants me to remember it.

636
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,890
I've had time to write a book about

637
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:31,660
The way you act and look -

638
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:35,760
I haven't got a paragraph.

639
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,570
Words are always getting in my way,

640
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,380
Anyway, I love you,

641
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,460
That's all I have to tell you,

642
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:58,200
That's all I've got to say.

643
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,700
And now, I'd like to make a speech about

644
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,610
The love that touches each,

645
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,560
But, stumbling, I would make you laugh.

646
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:20,190
I feel as though my tongue were made of clay,

647
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:23,600
Anyway, I love you,

648
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,890
That's all I have to tell you.

649
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:37,410
I'm not a man of poetry,

650
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,010
Music isn't one with me,

651
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,820
It runs from me,

652
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,670
Runs from me.

653
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,680
- And I would like to write a symphony...
- Once, when I was searching...

654
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:00,460
- I lost the melody.
- Somewhere out of reach, far away,

656
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:05,550
Alas, I only finished half.

658
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,840
And finish I suppose I never may,

659
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:16,540
- In a place I could not find, or heart obey.
- Anyway, I love you.

661
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:20,420
That's all I have to tell you.

662
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:24,080
Now that I'm a woman,

663
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:27,270
That's all I've got to say.

664
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:30,940
Now I know the way.

665
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,710
That's all I've got to say.

666
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,950
Now I know the way.

667
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:48,600
That's all I've got to say.

668
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,580
Great. Just what I need. Riddles.

669
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:04,560
When the wine drinks itself, when the skull speaks, 
when the clock strikes the right time.

670
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,150
As if I didn't have enough troubles. I wonder what time it is.

671
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:14,850
Well, of course you're of noble birth; anybody can see that.

672
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:19,380
I mean, you can't really be that ridiculous magician's niece.

673
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:20,910
That's out of the question.

674
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,870
Your majesty?

675
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:40,140
Love is slowing you down, my lady. 
I will catch you at last if you love much more.

676
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,280
Look, your son is coming home.

677
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,020
Lir? He's none of mine.

678
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:49,300
I picked him up on a doorstep where some peasant had left him.

679
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:53,410
I was thinking that I had never been happy, 
and never had a son.

680
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:58,020
It was pleasant at first, but it died quickly.

681
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,730
There is only one thing that has ever made me happy.

682
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,000
What is that?

683
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,870
Do not mock me.

684
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,960
I know very well what you have come for, 
and you know very well that I have them;

685
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,060
try to take them if you can, but do not mock me!

686
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:23,520
My lord, in all your castle, in all your realm, 
there is nothing of yours that I desire.

687
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,110
Good day, your majesty.

688
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:28,630
I know you!

689
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:39,010
I almost knew you as soon as I saw you coming on the road; since
then, there is no movement of yours that has not betrayed you!

690
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:51,300
A pace, a glance, a turn of the head, the flash of your throat as you
breathe, even your way of standing perfectly still, they were all my spies!

691
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:59,020
You made me wonder for a while. But your time is done.

692
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:09,390
The tide is turning. Come and see. Come here.

693
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:19,170
There. There they are. There they are! They are mine! They belong to
me!

694
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:26,460
The Red Bull gathered them for me one by one, and I bade him drive
each one into the sea!

695
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,240
Now, they live there.

696
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:34,980
And every tide carries them within an easy step of the land, but they
dare not come out of the water!

697
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:38,640
They are afraid of the Red Bull.

698
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:45,270
I like to watch them. They fill me with joy.

699
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,380
The first time I felt it I thought I was going to die.

700
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,300
I said to the Red Bull,

701
01:08:53,700 --> 01:09:04,940
"I must have them. I must have all of them, all there are, for
nothing makes me happy, but their shining, and their grace."

702
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,370
So the Red Bull caught them.

703
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:43,220
Each time I see the unicorns, my unicorns, it is like that morning in
the woods, and I am truly young, in spite of myself!

704
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:47,940
You are the last.

705
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:53,050
My lord, I-I do not understand. I see nothing at all in the water!

706
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:57,370
Do you still deny yourself?

707
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:04,000
Do you dare still pretend to be human?

708
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,780
I'll hurl you down to the others with my own hands if you dare deny
yourself!

709
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,190
What are you saying?!

710
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:20,970
It must be so; I cannot be mistaken. Yet - your eyes.

711
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:30,680
Your eyes have become empty, as Lir's - as any eyes that - never saw
unicorns.

712
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:42,110
It makes no difference. I can wait. The end will be the same. I can
wait.

713
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,700
He is mad! Mad!

714
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,640
Shhh, don't, don't, don't. It's all right. We'll find them.

715
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,510
Come on, come to me.

716
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,070
Oh, please, please don't cry.

717
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:59,770
If you've become human enough to cry then no magic in the world can
change you back.

718
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:05,220
Just come with me. Shh, don't cry. I promise you we'll find them.

719
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,160
Shut up, you pretentious kneecap! How would you like a punch in the
eye?

720
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:19,840
Schmendrick, you made it laugh anyway. Maybe that's all you need for
the riddle.

721
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,900
It isn't.

722
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,390
Oh! You can speak! Schmendrick, it worked!

723
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:49,180
Come on. Ask me how to find the Red Bull. Even Prince Lir doesn't
know the secret way, but I do.

724
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:54,330
So you do, eh? Answer the riddle, then. Tell us the way.

725
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,450
Say please.

726
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:58,800
Please.

727
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,200
No. No!

728
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,910
Why not? What kind of game is this?

729
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:18,640
Oh, it's so nice to have someone to play with!

730
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:28,100
Try me tomorrow; maybe I'll tell you tomorrow!

731
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:34,470
But we have no time! We may be too late now!

732
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:38,350
I have time. I've got time enough for all of us.

733
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,640
Never mind him. Give me the wine; let me see what I can do with the
wine.

734
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:46,700
Wine?

735
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,410
I couldn't find any. I looked everywhere. I LOOKED!

736
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,860
I thought, if you had some water to start with -

737
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:05,210
Him? Turn water into wine?

738
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,690
Keep quiet! Let me have it; I'll give it a try. 
Now you understand, it's not going to be very good wine.

739
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:16,240
Vin ordinaire, if that. And it'll be too sweet and...

740
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,760
Well, here goes.

741
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:30,230
What are you doing? Hey, do it over here, I can't see a thing!

742
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:37,350
It's weak at best, no nose, no body. Hardly any boquet at all.

743
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:40,290
Well, that's done it, that's finally done it!

744
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:46,990
No, wait, hey, don't! Don't do that! Give it to me 
if you don't want it, but don't throw it away!

745
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,520
But you're dead! You can't smell wine, can't taste it!

746
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,770
But I remember...

747
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:04,470
Well, if you should happen to remember the entrance 
to the Red Bull's lair as well as you remember wine -

748
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:09,570
Done! Give me one drink now and I'll tell you 
anything you want to know.

749
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,880
You can have all of it - after you tell us the way.

750
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,880
The way is through the clock.

751
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,070
Through that?

752
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:23,050
You mean, when the clock strikes the right time it opens, 
and there's a secret stair?

753
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:28,420
That clock will never strike the right time. 
You just walk through it and the Red Bull is on the other side.

754
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,580
Give me the wine.

755
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:33,720
Walk through a clock? What am I, a magician?

756
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:40,160
To meet the Red Bull, you have to walk through time. 
A clock isn't time, it's just numbers and springs.

757
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:45,730
Pay it no mind, just walk right on through. About that wine now...

758
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:12,080
Ah, that was the real stuff. That was WINE. 
You're more of a magician than I thought.

759
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:13,990
Let's go.

760
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:20,070
My lady, it's time. We're going to find the others now.

761
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:26,660
Oh no. No you don't. Not that one.

762
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:37,080
Unicorn! Unicorn! Haggard! Haggard! Unicorn! Unicorn!

763
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:38,800
Run!

764
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:43,560
Haggard! There they go! Down to the Red Bull!

765
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:51,560
The clock, Haggard! There they go! Unicorn! Unicorn!

766
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,380
Come on. Go on through.

767
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,300
Schmendrick! I don't think-

768
01:15:59,300 --> 01:15:59,940
Go on!

769
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,560
It worked!

770
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,070
Prince Lir!

771
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,860
You would have gone without me?

772
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:27,810
I would have come back. I don't know why I'm here 
or who I am, but I would have come back.

773
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:31,840
No, you would never have come back.

774
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,250
Never mind all that! Where's Schmendrick?

775
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:47,140
Where is he? I'll go back myself if you won't!

776
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,370
Schmendrick!

777
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:57,030
It's all right, it's not deep. How did you know how to get in?

778
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,890
What was there to know? I saw where she had gone and I followed.

779
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,780
Haggard has destroyed the clock.

780
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,970
Now there's no way back and no way out 
but through the Red Bull's passage.

781
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:32,230
And the rest you know. We came here seeking unicorns 
and we have possibly found them, at last.

782
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:40,530
I used to have a dream, over and over, about standing at my window 
in the middle of the night and seeing the Bull, the Red Bull

783
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:44,260
Yes. Driving unicorns into the sea. It was no dream.

784
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:49,540
Haggard has them all now, drifting in and out on the tide 
for his delight, all but one.

785
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,810
That one is the Lady Amalthea.

786
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:01,020
Unicorn, mermaid, sorceress, no name you would give her 
would surprise or frighten me.

787
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,840
I love whom I love.

788
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:06,510
Well, that's a very nice sentiment. 
But when I change her back into her true self-

789
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,600
I love whom I love.

790
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,190
I heard what you said. I will go no further.

791
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,480
There's no choice. We have to go on.

792
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,410
Don't let him change me.

793
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,850
The Red Bull has no care for human beings.

794
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,450
We may walk out past him and get away.

795
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:29,430
If we do that, all the unicorns in the world will remain 
prisoner forever except one, and she will grow old and die.

796
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:33,050
Everything dies. I want to die when you die.

797
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,030
I'm no unicorn, no magical creature!

798
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,890
I'm human, and I love you.

799
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,580
Don't let him!

800
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:45,710
Lir, I will not love you when I am a unicorn.

801
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:46,980
Amalthea, don't.

802
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:52,340
Then let the quest end here. I don't think 
I could change her back even if you wished it.

803
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:54,820
Marry the prince and live happily ever after.

804
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,800
Yes. That is my wish.

805
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:07,450
No. Lady, I am a hero, and heroes know that things 
must happen when it is time for them to happen.

806
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,520
A quest may not simply be abandoned.

807
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:18,890
Unicorns may go unrescued for a long time, but not forever. 
The happy ending cannot come in the middle of the story.

808
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:21,070
But what if there isn't a happy ending at all?

809
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,260
There are no happy endings, because nothing ends.

810
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:29,750
Schmendrick, let her stay the way she is. Let her be.

811
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:32,510
That's not in the story. Lir knows that, and so does she.

812
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,590
You don't care!

813
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,490
You don't care what happens to her, or to the others, 
just so you become a real magician at last.

814
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:39,320
You don't care!

815
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:45,210
I wish I didn't! I wish to God I didn't care about anything 
but my magic! But I do! I do.

816
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:49,580
Schmendrick!

817
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,740
Molly, he knows! He knows!

818
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:23,310
My ankle! Help!

819
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,520
Amalthea!

820
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,560
Don't move!

821
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,200
She'll be killed!

822
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:55,370
Agu coganu mutariti copona! Copona!

823
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:56,000
Lir!

824
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,100
Amalthea!

825
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:21,920
Look!

826
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:39,180
Do something! You have the power! I will kill you 
if you don't do something!

827
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,460
I cannot! Not all the magic in the world can help her now.

828
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:47,630
Then what is magic for? What is the use of wizardry, 
if it cannot even save a unicorn?

829
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,710
That's what heroes are for.

830
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:55,600
Of course, that's exactly what heroes are for.

831
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:01,680
No!

832
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,540
She's attacking!

833
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,660
She's fighting back!

834
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:11,020
The last! I knew you were the last!

835
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:39,980
Oh, you stayed. You stayed.

836
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:59,940
Father? Father, I had that same dream...

837
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,190
No. No, I was dead!

838
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,710
I remember you. I remember.

839
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:36,830
I will miss you. I never had any friends before.

840
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,640
We will come back.

841
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:43,870
I wish I could see her just once more, 
to - to tell her all that's in my heart.

842
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,650
She will never know what I really meant to say.

843
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:52,000
She will remember your heart when men 
are fairy tales in books written by rabbits.

844
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:56,930
Of all unicorns, she is the only one who knows 
what regret is - and love.

845
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:25,390
You are a true wizard now, as you always wished. 
Does it make you happy?

846
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:31,070
Well, men don't always know when they're happy, 
but I-I think so. And you?

847
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:33,100
I am a little afraid to go home.

848
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,340
I have been mortal, and some part of me is mortal yet.

849
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:43,600
I am no longer like the others; 
for no unicorn was ever born who could regret.

850
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:47,150
But now I do. I regret.

851
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,620
I am sorry, I have done you evil and I cannot undo it.

852
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:54,360
No. Unicorns are in the world again.

853
01:26:54,850 --> 01:27:02,310
No sorrow will live in me as long as that joy - save one, 
and I thank you for that part too.

854
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:07,580
Farewell, good magician. I will try to go home.

855
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:22,540
I'm Alive!

856
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:27,470
I'm Alive!

857
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:44,080
When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning,

858
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:53,520
And the future has passed without even a last desperate warning,

859
01:27:54,230 --> 01:28:02,710
Then look into the stars, where through the clouds a path is torn,

860
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:12,470
Look and see her, how she sparkles, it's the last unicorn!

861
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:17,100
I'm Alive!

862
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:21,780
I'm Alive!
