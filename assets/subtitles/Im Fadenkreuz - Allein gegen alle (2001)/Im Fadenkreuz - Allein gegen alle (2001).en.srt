1
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,842
The much-criticized Cincinnati
Accord has brought a cease-fire to Bosnia,

2
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:25,647
and it appears to be holding, prompting
NATO forces to begin a withdrawal,

3
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,551
which should be complete by New Year's Day,

4
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,682
close to the US president's
"Home by the holidays " pledge.

5
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,623
Yet even as the conflict winds down,

6
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:39,495
the US military remains in a high state
of readiness, eager to answer the call.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,435
Golden Eagle, this is Hawkeye. I've got
unknown rider not responding to coms.

8
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,369
Suspect hostile intent.

9
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:50,638
Unclassified bandit.
Launch the alert. Launch the alert.

10
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:03,752
Sailors, let's move it out there. We need
to get this aircraft airborne in five minutes.

11
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,498
- Nose wheel.
- Check.

12
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,939
- Gun-blast diffuser.
- Clear.

13
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,272
- Right intake. Left intake.
- Check. Check.

14
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,938
- Ejection seat is safe. Arm handle.
- Copy. I show safe.

15
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,447
- Com IFF.
- Up and up. Let's go. Move it.

16
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,178
- DDl, MPCD and ETD.
- Go flight.

17
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,414
- FCS, ECS, AWP.
- It's all green across the board.

18
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,684
- OK for start.
- Copy. OK for start.

19
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,352
- OK, right throttle, 15 per cent.
- Copy, 15 per cent. Go for two.

20
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,896
Two is up. ECS turbine is online.

21
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,091
Copy. Nozzle coming in at 73 per cent.

22
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,631
- Good to go.
- Copy. Good to go.

23
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,737
That's a NATO bird. Stand it down.

24
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,898
Cat four, abort.

25
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,307
- What?
- That's bullshit! Are you kidding me?

26
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,437
Abort, abort. Suspend cat four.
Launch is canceled.

27
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,779
- Guys, come on. That's twice today.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,778
They're wound up tight today.
Guess that's the price of peace.

29
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,584
I cannot wait for this shit to be done.

30
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,660
OK.

31
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,588
Four more days.

32
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:25,598
You know what I was reading the other day?
Bill Gates has more money than Peru.

33
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,472
Now, he needs someone to fly his jets.
We oughta be flyin' for him.

34
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,842
Yeah, but you know what?
I bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.

35
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:37,145
Or fly for a rock star. I mean, if anybody
needs a good pilot, it's those guys.

36
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:42,052
Whenever you turn around we've lost another
band to some shitty hack they got flyin' 'em.

37
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,756
I mean, it's sad.

38
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:47,987
Navy pilot coulda saved Ritchie Valens
from bein' a one-hit wonder. That's a fact.

39
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:52,122
Cos that kid had talent.
You know, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Buddy Holly...

40
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:56,496
- What about John Denver?
- Well, let's not get carried away.

41
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:09,243
Let me ask you something. How fast
do you think we're headed into the wind?

42
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,583
Chris, we're still on alert. If Reigart
wanders up to the tower, we're dead.

43
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,354
All right, let's do it.

44
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,426
That's the spirit.

45
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:28,162
- Rutherford. Right here.
- Incoming!

46
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,338
You guys ready for a little lesson in physics?

47
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,636
You never learn, kid.
I'm gonna take your money this week.

48
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,211
Wind's blowin' up a gale.

49
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,913
I bet you 20 bucks each
I catch it when it comes back.

50
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:45,076
- Man, you'll lose a finger along with that 20.
- This one?

51
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,348
All right.
Always happy to take an officer's money.

52
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,715
Look at that, Stackhouse! Look!

53
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,090
That is awesome!

54
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,356
Hey, watch out for the catwalk!

55
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,508
Wilson!

56
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:56,049
On the flight deck, heads up.
NATO helo landing spot six. Spot six.

57
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:17,204
This is a lot of sorties for an action
that's winding down, Leslie.

58
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,678
I'm struggling to get my pilots
15 hours a month up there.

59
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:26,217
You understand how important it is that your
pilots don't stray from the agreed fly zones?

60
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,812
- This treaty is fragile.
- The routes will be flown as ordered.

61
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,022
The treaty depends on it.

62
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,185
Aernout Van Lynden. He's with Sky News.

63
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:42,000
- What is this?
- I invited him to report on the battle group.

64
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:46,198
I'd like you to give him a tour of the ship.
Show him how everything works.

65
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:51,672
Admiral, I find the press to be an intrusive
presence. It inspires showing off.

66
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,542
What's so funny, Admiral?

67
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,310
You, Admiral,
are just what the conflict needs.

68
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,821
- An uncomplicated man.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

69
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,957
But wait a second.
Did you see the one with the, uh...?

70
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,529
Well, well, well, looky here. Stackhouse.

71
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:15,000
- I know that's not Burnett.
- Captain? Good to see you. All right.

72
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,503
- Look at you, look at you.
- What are you guys doing back on board?

73
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,903
Well, we just finished up in Sarajevo,

74
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,772
and your Admiral wanted us
to pump you guys up.

75
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,038
Sounds like Reigart. "Be prepared. "

76
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,480
Well, it's better to be prepared
than to be caught sleepin' in the field.

77
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,178
Don't you forget what you're doin' here.

78
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:37,213
What we're doing here?
Are you kidding me?

79
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,021
Well, I'm eating Jell-O.
Uh, he's wipin' his hands.

80
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,922
You know, everybody has a role to play.

81
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,730
See, me, I'm a marine.
We take care of the serious business.

82
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,739
You, you're a navy pilot,
and your role is to eat Jell-O.

83
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,278
You don't get to pick your fight.
It comes to you.

84
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,270
Yeah, I get it.

85
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,543
But at least give me a fight I can understand.

86
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:08,114
Vukovar? Where's the place
we flew over the other day? Sreb...?

87
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,088
Srebrenica.

88
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,920
And good luck talkin' to someone at home:

89
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,688
"Today's Tuesday.
We're helping these people. "

90
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:20,324
"No, no, now it's switched around.
Now we're helping... " It's like a joke.

91
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,270
- Just be glad it's over.
- Yeah. I am.

92
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,171
Look at these guys.

93
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,683
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

94
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:44,985
Everybody thinks they're gonna get a chance
to punch some Nazi in the face at Normandy.

95
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,027
And those days are over. They are long gone.

96
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,397
I used to think I'd get a chance to do it.
Now I realize I'll be eating Jell-O.

97
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,361
- Are you gonna eat that, by the way?
- Now you wanna eat everybody's Jell-O.

98
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,529
Lieutenant Burnett?

99
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,733
Admiral Reigart would like
to see you immediately.

100
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,868
- What the hell is this?
- Be prepared.

101
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,878
Thank you.

102
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,471
Maybe he wants to give you
his daughter's number.

103
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,613
Did you see Tennessee on Saturday?
Boy, they looked good.

104
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,779
I don't know anything, Lieutenant.

105
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,292
Now, that is cynical.
And Southerners usually aren't that cynical.

106
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,022
I give you a compliment
on how great your alma mater looks,

107
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,861
and you think I'm tryin' to pump you
for information. What does he want?

108
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,867
I guess you'll have to see, sir.

109
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,705
Come.

110
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,405
- Lieutenant Burnett, sir.
- Master Chief O'Malley, thank you.

111
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,743
Lieutenant Burnett.

112
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:46,478
- Sir, about the football today, I know...
- I have your letter.

113
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,522
I understand you're interested
in leaving the navy.

114
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,491
Yes, sir. It's time to move on.

115
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,790
If you don't mind my asking,
move on to what?

116
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:56,863
Sir?

117
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:01,424
Are you gonna fly commercial jets?
Troll the friendly skies in a bus?

118
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,733
You've had an interesting career, Lieutenant.

119
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,174
I remember when you came on board.
Smart as a whip, tons of potential.

120
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:15,012
- Thank you, sir.
- And then, on September 23rd,

121
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,846
you received a non-punitive letter of caution

122
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,854
for disorderly behavior
at the China Fleet Club in Hong Kong.

123
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,949
Another letter a month later
for something involving Chinese New Year

124
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,522
at Pattaya Beach in Thailand.

125
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,292
One can only imagine what that was.

126
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:42,602
Just out of curiosity, Lieutenant,
what happened to you?

127
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,902
Sir, I signed up to be a fighter pilot.
I didn't wanna be a cop.

128
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:52,577
I certainly didn't wanna be a cop walkin' the
beat in a neighborhood no one cares about.

129
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:55,052
That and the routine on the ship
kinda wore me out.

130
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,453
- The routine?
- The routine.

131
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,284
What you don't know from experience
is that the routine, the systems checks,

132
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:07,390
the drills, the maintaining of discipline,
that's what you do to prepare for war.

133
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,428
- We're not at war, sir.
- Yes, we are.

134
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:15,872
Unless we're parked in San Diego Bay, you're
at war every time you step on this boat.

135
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:19,139
- You understand that?
- No, sir, I do not understand.

136
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,173
If we're at war, why don't we act like it?

137
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:27,344
Cos as far as I can tell, we go out,
we fly around and we come back.

138
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:33,583
Maybe we're pretending we're in the fight,
but we're not fighting, we're watching.

139
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:38,427
You should be glad you're not in a fight.
With your attitude you wouldn't last long.

140
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,593
Sir, I've given the navy seven good years.
I think I've served my country.

141
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:47,170
You wouldn't know the first thing
about serving your country.

142
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,300
You have two weeks remaining on this tour.

143
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:55,370
You will serve them in a manner
befitting a naval officer.

144
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,917
I'll keep your letter in my pocket.

145
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,455
At the end of those two weeks,
you be on your way.

146
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,498
You're dismissed, mister.

147
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,400
Sir.

148
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,117
O'Malley told me you dropped your letter.

149
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,552
He's tellin' the truth.

150
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,649
So you're gonna break up the band, huh?

151
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,727
Oh, that's good.

152
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:44,991
Hey, listen, Chris. Listen, I thought
you were kidding about getting out.

153
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,431
You telling me I gotta find another navigator?
Is that the deal?

154
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,971
I can't do it anymore. I'm done. I'm sorry.

155
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:10,653
All hands. An air contact
believed to have originated in the North Pole

156
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:14,420
has been spotted
and is inbound to USS Carl Vinson.

157
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,756
No, no, it's good to hear your voice. No, no.

158
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,859
Yeah, they're taking care of us great.

159
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,868
They're putting up tinsel,
and it's very Christmasy.

160
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,030
No, Dad, don't wake her.
Just tell her I said "merry Christmas. "

161
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,867
We're disappointed
that we won't be seeing you.

162
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,171
Well, you may get to see a lot of me soon.

163
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,113
Well, we understand. You got
important things to do over there.

164
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,979
Dad, I gotta go.

165
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,010
- We're very proud of you.
- Dad, I gotta get goin'.

166
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,783
- All right, I love you.
- Bye.

167
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,461
That son of a bitch!

168
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,898
Did you see this? He put us
on the holiday mission. Goddammit.

169
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,995
- Well, at least we get to fly.
- Yeah, during the one good meal of the year.

170
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:05,009
- It's almost like he doesn't like us.
- No. You, not me. You.

171
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:09,137
Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

172
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:14,118
Aircraft remaining for the NATO
solo photo reconnaissance mission.

173
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,709
Wouldn't it be great to look back
and there's Britney Spears?

174
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:47,617
But wait, she wants to try flyin' the plane.
Yeah, just move the stick right there. Yeah.

175
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,460
The Cincinnati Accord verifies Serbia's
commitment to a lasting peace in Yugoslavia.

176
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:55,948
I welcome the announcement
that NATO will leave the region.

177
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:22,272
Coordinates 301506.51150 confirmed.
Sectors are all concurrent.

178
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,649
- You sure about that?
- I'm readin' it right here, pal.

179
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,022
Yeah, well, uh...

180
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:36,623
the Serbs must've bought some old U-boats,
cos we're flyin' over a lake.

181
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,765
Goddammit.

182
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:47,465
And a warm thank you to the US intelligence
community, ladies and gentlemen.

183
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,638
Yet another useless joyride at the cost
of mere millions to the US taxpayer.

184
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,449
Hey, hang on. Scope showing activity
in section four alpha to our left.

185
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,715
Must be in that forested area.

186
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:08,317
That's the demilitarized zone.
There shouldn't be any activity.

187
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:12,592
Yeah, I know, I know. But the scope
doesn't lie. There it is. Let's check it out.

188
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,226
We're not supposed to fly that section.
The brass'll have a shit fit.

189
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,430
Hey, we're on recon,
so let's recon something.

190
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,770
Stack, it's probably just
some locals fooling around.

191
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,642
Could be a good opportunity
to test our shiny new digital camera.

192
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:30,147
Why do I listen to you? All right, let's do it.

193
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,321
ECM is clear. GPS is synced
with new coordinates.

194
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,189
Steady up 0-3-4 and fly the director.

195
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,900
- IDEM camera is at speed.
- Got it. Going into burner.

196
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,202
On condition. Stand by for roll... now.

197
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,813
Rolling digital.

198
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,485
Smile, guys. You're on TV.

199
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,980
- Aren't you gonna miss all this excitement?
- Oh, absolutely.

200
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,297
- What is it?
- Holy shit! We're being painted!

201
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,390
What?!

202
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,036
Shit! They fired! Scoop it, now!

203
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,972
- Pull up! Get the nose moving!
- Roger!

204
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,674
- I see a single missile tracking on us.
- I don't see it. Call my turn.

205
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,081
Slice left. Hard!

206
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,749
Jesus Christ!

207
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,948
Where is it?

208
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,025
Reverse right!

209
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,228
Try to break the lock!

210
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:07,102
- Golden Eagle, we have been engaged.
- Roger.

211
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,136
- Put out decoy flares.
- Copy.

212
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,148
- No joy.
- Where is it, goddammit? Where is it?!

213
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,740
I can't see shit! Where is he?!

214
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,864
Jesus Christ! Second missile in the air!
Three miles and closing!

215
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:35,662
- Pull up! Change your vector!
- I got him! I got him!

216
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,037
We need a bigger heat decoy.

217
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,882
We're screwed!

218
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:04,195
Missile's closing. 2.8... 1.8... 1 mile!

219
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,555
Drop the fuel tanks and pull up!

220
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,035
Good fireball!

221
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,643
Clear on top. Coming back down.

222
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:25,417
I got two missiles in sight,
both tracking for the fireball.

223
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,918
That's it! One down. Up we go.

224
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:36,727
- Where's the second?
- No joy. I don't have it in sight.

225
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,930
- He's back on us. Push over!
- Copy.

226
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,036
Hard left.

227
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:49,697
- I'm going for a head-on pass.
- Here he comes! Head on, right side!

228
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,738
He clipped us! Part of the tail's gone!

229
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:57,475
- Flight controls going to shit!
- Where is it?

230
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,778
He's coming back.
Missile arcing right. Break!

231
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,620
I got no turn left, Chris!
The controls are shot!

232
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,694
Nose break, right!

233
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,130
Shit!

234
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:32,074
Shit! Seat eject! Eject, eject!

235
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,790
Goddammit.

236
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:26,159
- You throw a hell of a party, sir.
- Yeah, I really like Christmas.

237
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,496
Sir, we've lost a bird, an F-18. Feet dry.

238
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:35,032
Ark Angel Zero Six.

239
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,200
Burnett and Stackhouse.

240
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,835
Goddammit. I put 'em on the holiday mission.

241
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,380
- Any beacon activity?
- Not yet, Admiral.

242
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,316
We have a radar plot of flight path
from feet dry to last contact.

243
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:49,081
Here in yellow is the assigned path.

244
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,623
In the red is actual.

245
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,431
Lost contact is here.

246
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:06,935
They're off-mission. What the hell happened?

247
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,100
It'll be tough to pick up a beacon signal,
even from a satellite.

248
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,371
The terrain is extremely rough.

249
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,310
Damn weather's sure not helping.

250
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:18,315
Contact Admiral Piquet,
alert NATO chain of command.

251
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:22,285
Make sure we have a FLASH op rep
out over all US national circuits.

252
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,481
And get through to Admiral Donnelly.

253
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,150
- No names.
- No names, sir.

254
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,404
Stack! Stackhouse!

255
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,017
Stack!

256
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,379
Are you OK?

257
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,387
Yeah.

258
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,883
- Shit, man. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK. You look terrible.

259
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,257
Yeah? Hey, man, that looks pretty bad.

260
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,728
Let me see this. Oh, man.

261
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:11,066
Oh, we gotta change this.
We need a field dressing on this.

262
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,705
Shit. Squeeze right here.

263
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,880
So...

264
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,406
where are we, Mr Navigator Man?

265
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:29,446
In the mountains north of Miciovic.

266
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,954
You think they saw us eject?

267
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,723
We are not gonna be around to find out.

268
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,991
Reigart'll be curious
what happened to his $40 million plane.

269
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,264
Forget it. I already tried.
You need to get to higher ground.

270
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,168
What?

271
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:50,041
You think it'll work up there?

272
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,269
Yeah. Just get high enough.

273
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,609
All right. All right, sit tight.

274
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,447
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

275
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:06,119
Listen, I should've dodged
that second missile.

276
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:11,260
Yeah, you should've. You blew it.
You took me down with you.

277
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:13,696
I thought you had great reflexes.
What happened?

278
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:18,998
I used to have, like, a good pilot.
Man, you're slippin'. You need to watch it.

279
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,653
Oh, God.

280
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,759
Oh, shit.

281
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,093
Urgh!

282
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,035
Oh, goddammit.

283
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,111
Son of a bitch.

284
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,245
Reconnaissance mission, yes?

285
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,776
Not bombing mission, right?

286
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:31,286
You photograph?

287
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,665
You alone?

288
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,040
Correct.

289
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,556
No!

290
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,537
Alpha Whiskey, this is
Ark Angel Zero Six. Over.

291
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:12,081
Alpha Whiskey, this is
ArkAngel Zero Six. Over. Can you read me?

292
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,982
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir. There's some interference.

293
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,386
It's the beacon from the ejector seat, sir.

294
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,720
- Well, shut it off.
- Aye aye, sir.

295
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:25,195
Alpha Echo, Alpha Echo, Alpha Whiskey
directs cease buzzer on Zero Six.

296
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:40,308
Alpha Whiskey, this is ArkAngel Zero Six.
Over. Do you read?

297
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:44,477
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

298
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,855
Ark Angel is down. I say again.
Ark Angel is down, and I am on the run.

299
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:53,584
Slow down. What is your count?

300
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,230
Minus one. Stackhouse. They shot him.

301
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,730
No names over the net.

302
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,202
Confirm your last.

303
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,435
Minus one. Confirmed.

304
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:15,035
Serbs in camo shot my pilot.

305
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:20,715
You're saying a uniformed soldier
killed your flight officer?

306
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,880
No, I'm saying they executed him.

307
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:27,857
They talked... They were talking to him,
then they shot him in the head.

308
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:32,625
All right, calm down, son.
We're working on it. Wait one.

309
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:37,532
- How soon can your team be ready?
- We're ready now, sir. All I need is a ride.

310
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,296
Zero Six, consult your chart.

311
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,202
Reposition to rally point three.

312
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:50,376
I read 133-41. Maintain radio silence.

313
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,508
We're comin' to get you, son.
Just get to the rally point.

314
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,383
- Understood?
- Zero Six copies. Out.

315
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,759
- Contact Piquet and Donnelly.
- Aye aye, sir.

316
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,590
Let 'em know I need a green light
to go get my boy.

317
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,918
Command and control
comes from Red Crown.

318
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:13,760
You men have three slicks loaded with
2.75 rocket pods and guns at your disposal.

319
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,799
Use advisedly.

320
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,893
I want gimbal attachments
for all fast ropers.

321
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,833
Team leaders report to me
as soon as your squad is ready.

322
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,703
Come.

323
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,108
Admiral, what's going on down there?

324
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:34,174
We have an F-18 down in southern Bosnia.
One pilot suspected dead.

325
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,488
Who authorized a search and rescue?

326
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,491
- I did.
- Call it off. Stand down, Admiral.

327
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:46,523
Maybe I didn't make myself clear. We have
pilots down. One probably already dead.

328
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,398
Admiral, I have spoken personally
to Bosnian military commanders.

329
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,629
They say the shoot-down was perpetrated

330
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:56,834
by renegade forces
attempting to disrupt the peace process.

331
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,637
Of course they say that.

332
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:03,443
They're also claiming, Admiral,
that your aircraft was way off-mission.

333
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:07,416
If we fly in there we create a shitstorm,
and the whole treaty will collapse.

334
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,148
Admiral, Burnett says
that Serb troops murdered his pilot.

335
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,588
Is your pilot an expert on Bosnia?

336
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:17,355
Can he distinguish between the uniforms
of Serbs, Croats and Muslims?

337
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:21,523
Because I can't, and I've been
posted here for five years.

338
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:25,562
If your man is in danger,
he should get himself into a safe zone.

339
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:28,606
That is what he's briefed and trained to do.

340
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:34,235
Listen, Leslie. I can have your fleet
commander order you to stand down,

341
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,940
or you can do it yourself.

342
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,496
Alpha Whiskey, this is Zero Six. Come in.

343
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,975
Zero Six, go ahead.

344
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,012
Zero Six is at rally point three
and standing by.

345
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:53,973
Zero Six, latest intel
says your current location

346
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,953
undoable for pickup.
Stand by to copy rendezvous point.

347
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,025
Say again your last.
I am at the rendezvous point.

348
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:06,019
You need to hump it out to a safe zone.

349
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:10,033
I set IP Cadillac. Canada 1-5,

350
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,502
Virginia 2-0. Read back.

351
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,454
No.

352
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,021
Negative. Negative.

353
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,627
I do not understand.
Why is this spot not doable for pickup?

354
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,789
I am good to go.

355
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:41,889
I say again, I am good to go now.

356
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,900
Burnett!

357
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:54,073
Zero Six, you are a combat naval aviator.
Start acting like one.

358
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:58,610
You've been shot down.
Life is tough. I am very sorry.

359
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:03,216
Now you pull yourself together.
You do whatever it takes.

360
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,347
Create some angles between
you and your pursuers.

361
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:11,122
Use your training. Use your head. Evade
and survive, and we will bring you home.

362
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,129
Understand? We will bring you home!

363
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,243
Zero Six?

364
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,476
Zero Six?

365
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,680
Someone's coming.

366
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:47,698
- We lost the signal, sir.
- Shit.

367
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,734
- Where is he? Triangulate his position.
- We're on it, sir.

368
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,886
We're tracking him in the SCIF, sir.

369
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,255
On me.

370
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,577
At ease.

371
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:45,952
Sir, we were able to track the emergency
radio signal to somewhere in this radius.

372
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:50,687
It's pretty far away. But we think
the pilot transmission came from here.

373
00:43:55,266 --> 00:44:00,101
This is imagery from a Northrop Grumman
relay satellite downlinked through Stuttgart.

374
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:04,608
We've hot-wired it for heat image,
and it's streaming in now.

375
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,735
This isn't strictly legal, sir.

376
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,448
OK, here we go.

377
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,229
- That's Burnett?
- Yes, sir.

378
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,319
Fuck!

379
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,625
What's going on? He's down.

380
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,357
He been shot?

381
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:05,033
They're almost on him.

382
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,767
Son of a bitch.

383
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,773
- Why isn't he moving?
- Come on, Burnett, move.

384
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:18,881
They're right on him!

385
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,933
What are they doing?

386
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:11,668
What's goin' on?

387
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:27,576
Has he been killed?

388
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,467
He's moving. That's him.

389
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:29,437
Briggs, stay on it.
Resize and widen broadband.

390
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:33,210
- Stay with him. Stay with him.
- Plug it in with NSA.

391
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:35,149
- What the hell's going on?
- Damn it.

392
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:39,553
- That's not us. The door's closing.
- Well, fix it, for chrissakes!

393
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,625
We're down. It's cooked.

394
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:46,229
I want intel on this situation.
Who's chasing him, and why? Understand?

395
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,094
Yes, sir.

396
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,031
Come.

397
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,737
Sorry, sir. Nothing in the last hour.

398
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:32,666
I was trying to motivate him, Tom.

399
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,335
Sir?

400
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,845
Burnett. In the radio room.

401
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:39,644
I was...

402
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:44,984
I was trying to motivate him,
but... maybe I carried it too far.

403
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,115
Called him by his name. How stupid. Damn.

404
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:52,320
Just human, sir.

405
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,825
- Tom.
- Sir?

406
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:03,206
It's why I push 'em so hard.
For times like these.

407
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,047
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Come on, Tom.

408
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:18,248
You're gonna say whatever
you're gonna say. Don't patronize me.

409
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:22,725
Sir, what in the hell are we doin'? We've got
a guy on the ground, and we're sittin' here.

410
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,795
It's a complicated situation.

411
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:27,456
Why isn't this all over the news?

412
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:32,468
Why isn't the president on the phone to Pale,
or whoever, makin' sure this kid gets out?

413
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,729
Well, he was off-mission.
Piquet has a point there.

414
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,298
All due respect,
Piquet's got his own agenda, sir.

415
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:44,373
Now, this kid might not have
the best attitude, but he's no idiot.

416
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,782
- He says he's gettin' shot at, I believe him.
- What the hell do you expect me to do?

417
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:53,084
Command tells me I gotta sit on my hands.
What else can I do?

418
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:56,690
Right.

419
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:59,627
I forgot. It's not your call.

420
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:02,561
You're damn right it's not my call!

421
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:09,337
Apology, sir. Of course,
you can't do anything.

422
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,790
It's been confirmed that an American
combat aircraft, an F-18 Super Hornet,

423
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,991
has been shot down over Bosnia.

424
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,434
It was hit over Miciovic in southern Bosnia
at around 6:00 yesterday morning.

425
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:14,061
Mr Burnett?

426
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:17,767
The pilot is feared dead, but his navigator
is believed to have survived.

427
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,001
It's about your son.

428
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:23,476
Their names are being withheld,
pending notification of their next of kin.

429
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:26,817
We still don't know who shot the F-18 down.

430
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:30,046
It's the Serbs who control
most of Southern Bosnia,

431
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,452
but they allege insurgents are to blame,

432
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:35,958
and say they're doing everything
to help locate the crew.

433
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:41,020
It's also unclear what, if any, impact
this incident will have on NATO's withdrawal...

434
00:52:38,754 --> 00:52:40,722
Admiral.

435
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:47,558
You and I have known each other
for how long? Five years?

436
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:49,722
Something like that.

437
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:53,964
I've always commended your work
to your superior officers.

438
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,663
I've sent you information
whenever you requested it.

439
00:52:56,772 --> 00:52:58,933
Thank you, sir. I appreciate your support.

440
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,407
And this is the thanks I get?

441
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:05,010
We have one disagreement
over how to handle a downed pilot,

442
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:06,911
and you stab me in the back?

443
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:10,747
You go to the media, to my contact,
and you make me look like an asshole.

444
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:14,345
You brought him on my boat.
His press report is accurate.

445
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,085
Our man is down behind enemy lines!

446
00:53:17,192 --> 00:53:19,626
Now what the fuck is the problem?!

447
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:24,727
Do you have any idea how much damage this
incident may cause to the peace process?

448
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:28,997
All I know, Admiral, is that the American
people want their pilot back.

449
00:53:29,104 --> 00:53:33,632
Exactly! Americans. All you care about
is your own damn pilots!

450
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:38,603
What happens when
the fighting starts again?

451
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:43,208
Will America recommit its forces
to stop a major war?

452
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:48,281
No. You don't have any control
over that little detail, do you?

453
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:55,221
You might have helped save
your man today, Reigart.

454
00:53:55,331 --> 00:53:57,856
And I emphasize might.

455
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:02,734
But you have risked the lives
of thousands tomorrow.

456
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:40,788
Shit!

457
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:30,545
Shit.

458
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:51,766
Argh!

459
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:25,116
Alpha Whiskey, Alpha Whiskey,
this is Ark Angel.

460
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,593
They've got a signal. It's Burnett.

461
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:33,031
Ark Angel Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Go ahead, Zero Six.

462
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:36,434
I'm on course with your last instructions.

463
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:43,867
Am keyed up and waiting for your...
waiting for you to name the fairway.

464
00:59:44,947 --> 00:59:47,939
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
How you doin', son?

465
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,082
I don't know. You tell me, sir.

466
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:56,920
The hard bit's over. You need to get yourself,
uh, five clicks east, uh, to the sweet spot.

467
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:58,993
Understood?

468
01:00:05,734 --> 01:00:07,998
Roger. Understand that spot to be friendly.

469
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:10,094
Good for birds?

470
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:12,605
That's affirmative. Spot is friendly.

471
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:17,372
You need to get there, stay out of trouble
and Big Mother will pick you up.

472
01:00:17,479 --> 01:00:19,106
Next contact at, um...

473
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:20,372
1700.

474
01:00:20,482 --> 01:00:22,450
Roger.

475
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:36,120
Alpha Whiskey?

476
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:38,490
Uh, go ahead, Zero Six.

477
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:47,039
Sir, I shouldn't have left Stackhouse.

478
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:53,081
Distract him.

479
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:58,244
Uh, Zero Six, your last transmission was
garbled. Let's talk about your, um... your gear.

480
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,913
How's it holding up?

481
01:01:06,395 --> 01:01:09,023
The gear's good. I have a basic pack.

482
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:11,497
I left some of it at the crash site.

483
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:17,703
I guess I got rattled when I ejected at Mach 3.

484
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:23,768
You still got your boots,
haven't you, cowboy?

485
01:01:23,879 --> 01:01:26,609
Roger. They were tied on.

486
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:30,678
You got it made.

487
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:38,351
You're an optimist, sir.
See, I had you figured for a grouch.

488
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:45,991
OK, Zero Six, just make it to the RP.

489
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:48,196
Roger.

490
01:01:48,703 --> 01:01:50,898
Are you gonna be there, sir?

491
01:01:51,006 --> 01:01:53,474
That's affirmative, son. Out.

492
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:01,146
He's here.

493
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:03,615
Yes, sir. I suggest we place him here.

494
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:07,984
It's open ground near the town of Hac,
well inside the safe zone.

495
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,892
All right, let's go for the extraction.

496
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:55,002
.. command area responsibility.
Ingress will be north, egress south.

497
01:02:56,004 --> 01:03:02,102
From the radio contacts, you can see he has
basically circled back towards the crash site.

498
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:06,613
Call sign is "Avalanche. "
Authenticate: "Romeo Two, X-ray. "

499
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:12,186
Continue: "Bulldog. " Delay: "Cycle. "
Abort is "Washdown. "

500
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:16,448
Aircraft down is "Cobalt. "
Success is "Ripper. "

501
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,624
- Captain, you can take it from here.
- Thank you, sir.

502
01:03:20,962 --> 01:03:25,422
Bravo will establish a perimeter, then
haul ass back to the helo on my command...

503
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:27,468
Admiral Reigart.

504
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:30,834
Let me introduce Colonel Brigand.
He will conduct the pickup.

505
01:03:30,939 --> 01:03:33,567
- Sir, my team is ready now.
- Get me Admiral Donnelly.

506
01:03:33,675 --> 01:03:37,441
I have spoken with Admiral Donnelly
and have his full support.

507
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:39,537
You will stand down.

508
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:13,137
Chris.

509
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:36,625
Hey!

510
01:05:51,479 --> 01:05:53,140
Yeah.

511
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:17,362
You American?

512
01:06:24,879 --> 01:06:26,676
Nine millimeters?

513
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:31,385
Nine millimeter.

514
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:09,487
Do you have water?

515
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,616
Water? No water.

516
01:07:22,337 --> 01:07:24,305
Thanks.

517
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:33,114
It's good.

518
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,144
Ice Cube.

519
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:42,883
Yeah. I like Ice Cube.

520
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:46,188
I like all hip-hop, uh, rap music.

521
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:50,322
West Coast, East Coast.
NWA, Public Enemy.

522
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:52,827
They said stop, freeze

523
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:57,132
I got froze up
because I'm public enemy number one

524
01:07:57,405 --> 01:07:59,771
One, one, one, one

525
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:06,076
That's good. That's good, that's good.

526
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:20,860
You know where we're going?

527
01:08:20,962 --> 01:08:21,929
Hac.

528
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,521
Hac? That's good. Good.

529
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,539
Jesus Christ!

530
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:45,482
Tell him to go!

531
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,084
Hey, come on! Come on!

532
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:50,117
Hey. Bonjour.

533
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:52,910
Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go, OK?

534
01:09:53,021 --> 01:09:56,582
Whoa, whoa. Hold it. I'm an American soldier
that's been shot down.

535
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:58,784
Shut up.

536
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:06,292
- What were you bombing?
- No bombing. We were taking photographs.

537
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:08,869
Photographs of what? Of what?!

538
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:12,205
Lokar's come back here again,
killing everyone.

539
01:10:12,307 --> 01:10:17,108
It's true. Lokar killed everyone. Children,
women... Buried them up in the hills.

540
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:20,146
In the hills?
Yes, I saw them. I saw the graves.

541
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:26,086
Yes, I saw them. I saw the bodies in the hills.

542
01:10:26,187 --> 01:10:28,747
Tell him. I am an American.
I am on your side.

543
01:10:28,856 --> 01:10:32,758
- That's what I'm sayin'. We're on your...
- Then you go outside.

544
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,725
Tell them you are an American.

545
01:10:34,829 --> 01:10:37,559
- They don't kill American.
- Ice Cube, tell them.

546
01:10:37,665 --> 01:10:40,600
Tell this guy that we have
photographs that can help...

547
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:44,138
Bullshit!

548
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:46,433
America say they make them sign deal.

549
01:10:50,545 --> 01:10:52,740
- I swear to God...
- But they already break it!

550
01:10:52,847 --> 01:10:55,907
America government for shit! Now go!

551
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:41,401
Hey, hey, hey...

552
01:15:41,502 --> 01:15:43,436
It's OK. It's me.

553
01:15:45,006 --> 01:15:46,803
Come on.

554
01:16:00,588 --> 01:16:02,249
Time?

555
01:16:02,356 --> 01:16:04,256
Three minutes, sir.

556
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,135
Stop! Shh.

557
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:31,251
Let's go.

558
01:16:54,675 --> 01:16:55,699
Reigart.

559
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:59,109
Leslie, I'm afraid there's bad news.

560
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:04,916
The Bosnian-Serb Fourth Army Patrol
found Lieutenant Burnett near Hac.

561
01:17:06,554 --> 01:17:09,785
I regret to inform you
that Lieutenant Burnett is...

562
01:17:10,524 --> 01:17:11,616
dead.

563
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:14,718
- I am sorry, Leslie.
- Thank you.

564
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:28,933
There's meant to be a peace deal.
Hac was meant to be a safe haven.

565
01:17:29,043 --> 01:17:32,342
Yet once again in Bosnia,
that's proved an illusion.

566
01:17:32,446 --> 01:17:35,244
And in the midst of fighting
around the southern enclave,

567
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:37,783
Bosnian Serb forces announced they'd found

568
01:17:37,885 --> 01:17:41,548
the body of the American navigator,
Lieutenant Chris Burnett,

569
01:17:41,655 --> 01:17:44,419
whose plane was shot down two days ago.

570
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:50,624
The Serb authorities are claiming
he was shot by Muslim guerrillas,

571
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:54,394
opposed to the recently signed
Cincinnati Peace Accord.

572
01:17:55,669 --> 01:17:59,161
The Serbs say the body
was discovered by one of their teams

573
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:03,972
in a search-and-rescue attempt
since the F-18 was shot down two days ago.

574
01:18:04,078 --> 01:18:08,105
This incident is bound to spoil NATO's hopes
for a clean exit from the Balkans,

575
01:18:08,215 --> 01:18:13,517
and frustrates US military leaders, only days
away from a withdrawal from Bosnia.

576
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:17,450
For NATO's forces
on the eve of their departure,

577
01:18:17,558 --> 01:18:21,688
the news ofLieutenant Burnett's death
comes as another dark blow

578
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:27,428
at the end ofa disturbing and ultimately
unsuccessful chapter in the alliance's history.

579
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,666
Savior Six, Savior Six
from Gold Eagle command.

580
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:39,075
Be advised the package is not in position.

581
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:43,378
Mission is scrubbed.
Return to base immediately.

582
01:18:52,993 --> 01:18:54,893
Hey!

583
01:18:54,995 --> 01:18:57,156
Hey! Wait!

584
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:09,376
We're here!

585
01:19:10,177 --> 01:19:13,669
Come on! Fuck! Damn it!

586
01:19:14,048 --> 01:19:16,107
We're right here!

587
01:19:16,784 --> 01:19:19,150
You've gotta be shitting me!

588
01:19:31,132 --> 01:19:33,828
Son of a bitch!
They killed him, and we did nothing!

589
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:36,198
- Captain...
- We did nothing!

590
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:39,770
We did nothing.

591
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:07,592
We were right here.

592
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:10,162
We were right... Fuck!

593
01:20:13,874 --> 01:20:15,637
What's that?

594
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:13,660
It's not safe here. We'll keep going.

595
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:17,137
No. You go.

596
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:28,338
They killed my pilot
because we took pictures of the graves.

597
01:21:28,449 --> 01:21:30,041
And I know where they are.

598
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:33,813
And I'm gonna get 'em,
so he didn't die for no reason.

599
01:21:42,563 --> 01:21:44,724
Don't follow me.

600
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:46,800
It's safer here.

601
01:24:06,073 --> 01:24:07,734
Shit.

602
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:10,776
Goddamn. Why is this off?

603
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,648
Why is this off? Why is this...?

604
01:24:46,747 --> 01:24:48,715
Come on.

605
01:24:50,317 --> 01:24:52,751
Come on! Goddammit!

606
01:24:56,423 --> 01:24:59,483
All right. OK. OK, come on. Come on.

607
01:25:00,427 --> 01:25:02,861
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

608
01:25:10,971 --> 01:25:15,067
For the information of all hands,
this ship will be relieved on station.

609
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:19,942
It will set course for home base,
effective 2300 this evening.

610
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:39,098
- Sir? Your presence is requested in the SCIF.
- All right, thank you.

611
01:25:40,968 --> 01:25:43,937
It's the homing beacon, sir.
On the second ejection seat.

612
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:47,063
The only way to reactivate it
is from the seat, manually.

613
01:25:47,341 --> 01:25:49,809
- How long has that been on?
- Seven minutes.

614
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:55,047
Sir, you've gotta be very familiar
with our systems to reactivate that beacon.

615
01:25:55,148 --> 01:25:57,639
- That's Burnett.
- Sir, it could be a setup.

616
01:25:57,751 --> 01:26:01,517
It's a radio transmission.
They are hearing the same music.

617
01:26:01,622 --> 01:26:03,749
Sir, I agree.

618
01:26:04,591 --> 01:26:08,960
Sir, we really should notify NATO command,
or at least contact Donnelly for clearance.

619
01:26:09,062 --> 01:26:14,591
- Of course, that will take a lot of time.
- Tom, I get it. We wait, Burnett dies.

620
01:26:14,701 --> 01:26:18,193
Piquet was very clear with his objections, sir.

621
01:26:18,438 --> 01:26:20,668
- You will lose your command for this.
- So be it.

622
01:26:20,774 --> 01:26:25,575
I'm not gonna let that kid die out there
while we sit around on this ship!

623
01:27:56,203 --> 01:27:59,036
OK. All right. OK.

624
01:28:02,175 --> 01:28:04,166
OK, all right.

625
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,442
Goddamn!

626
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:44,117
Gentlemen,

627
01:28:44,685 --> 01:28:47,711
I wanna make one thing clear before we leave.

628
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:51,817
I intend to put you in harm's way.

629
01:28:53,126 --> 01:28:58,325
Any man who doesn't wish to join
this mission, step away right now.

630
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,270
All right, then.
Let's go get our boy back.

631
01:31:26,012 --> 01:31:29,709
About two clicks up this valley,
we're gonna make a hard right.

632
01:33:00,073 --> 01:33:01,438
Argh!

633
01:33:15,855 --> 01:33:18,380
Argh...

634
01:33:54,661 --> 01:33:56,629
There he is. There he is!

635
01:34:14,748 --> 01:34:17,979
Come on! Come on!
Damn it! What the hell is he waiting for?

636
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:25,517
Come on!

637
01:34:34,534 --> 01:34:36,525
Come on! Come on, kid!

638
01:34:42,609 --> 01:34:46,045
It's too hot to set down.
We'll have to cover him aloft.

639
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:12,597
Goddammit!

640
01:35:24,984 --> 01:35:26,542
Come on!

641
01:35:26,653 --> 01:35:27,813
OK.

642
01:35:48,508 --> 01:35:49,497
Go!

643
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:52,271
Captain, fast rope. Go get him.

644
01:35:52,378 --> 01:35:54,573
Sir, he's on the rope.

645
01:36:03,556 --> 01:36:06,457
- Sniper in the open.
- We'll take him.

646
01:36:07,894 --> 01:36:09,623
Come on, son. Come on!

647
01:36:16,069 --> 01:36:17,366
Go!

648
01:36:35,588 --> 01:36:38,148
They got him! Pull up! Pull up!

649
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:12,716
Hey, Chris.

650
01:37:12,825 --> 01:37:14,793
Hey, Glen.

651
01:37:15,295 --> 01:37:16,262
Admiral.

652
01:37:22,335 --> 01:37:24,826
This is why they killed Stackhouse.

653
01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:35,176
Admiral?

654
01:37:35,281 --> 01:37:39,445
You were holding a letter for me.
I'd like to get it back.

655
01:37:40,186 --> 01:37:42,211
I think I can find it.
