1
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,708
I'm so sorry.
Can you help me? My tire...

2
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,208
Sorry. I have an appointment.
I don't like to be late.

3
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,167
Well, would you rather be late or dead?

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,875
- You don't want to do this.
- Step out of the car.

5
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,958
Whoo! Let's go, fellas!

6
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:23,167
Come on, baby! Yes!

7
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,667
Take it easy. The car's brand-new.

8
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:30,958
- No problem, buddy. I got this.
- Baby, let's ride. Time to go.

9
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,976
- Your parents know the kind of
company you're keeping?

10
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:33,965
- Shut up.

11
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,833
- This shit ain't working.
- It's coded.

12
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,042
- What's the code?
- I can't give you that.

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,458
We'll have to beat it out of you.
Get out the car.

14
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,750
Come on, man. What you got for me?

15
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,750
Kick your ass!

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,333
Hold on.

17
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:55,833
It just came out of the dry cleaner's.

18
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:19,708
Hands up.
Stop moving or I will shoot you.

19
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:22,500
Don't you have homework to do?

20
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,000
- Why don't you go and do it?
- OK. I'm sorry.

21
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,292
Late.

22
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,417
Hey! Hey!

23
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:50,917
- The game, the game, the game!
- What's the first rule when entering a man's car?

24
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,000
- Respect a man's car, a man respects you.
- Rule number two.

25
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:59,292
- Greet the man. Good afternoon, Frank.
- Good afternoon, Jack.

26
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,292
- Can we play the game?
- I should think you'd be tired after school.

27
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,292
- You're afraid I'm gonna win.
- You'll be too worn out to do your homework.

28
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,417
- It's Friday. I don't have any homework.
- In that case, the game.

29
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:16,208
- Yes!
- But first, what's the third rule of the car?

30
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,875
Good.

31
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,875
Five points. I'm white,
I'm round, but I'm not always around.

32
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:42,083
- A tennis ball?
- Tennis balls are yellow.

33
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,167
Four points.

34
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,167
Sometimes I'm half, sometimes I'm whole.
Sometimes a slice of me is all you know.

35
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,542
- A loaf of bread?
- No.

36
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,917
Three points. Sometimes I'm light,
sometimes I'm dark. Sometimes I'm both.

37
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,042
- I know. A light bulb.
- No.

38
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,542
- A pizza!
- No.

39
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,958
Audrey. Audrey! Stop walking away from me.

40
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,375
Listen, we've got to finish this conversation.

41
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,875
Where's he going?

42
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,750
OK, look at me. Last clue for all the points.

43
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:40,333
Everyone wants to walk on me,
but only a happy few ever have.

44
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,750
Take your time.

45
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,042
- Hey, bud.
- Shh! Mom, it's the game. I'm trying to think.

46
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,917
- Sorry. Hey, Frank. How are you today?
- Well, Mrs. Billings.

47
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,625
- Can I team up with Mom?
- I don't know. It's not in the rules.

48
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:05,417
Come on. What's the point in having rules
if you can't bend 'em?

49
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,542
- OK. Just this once.
- Yeah!

50
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,500
All right. Give me some clues.

51
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:17,000
It's round, but not always around. It's light
sometimes, dark sometimes, or both.

52
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:21,792
Everyone wants to walk on it,
but only a happy few ever have.

53
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,583
- That is a hard one.
- Tell me about it.

54
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,500
- The moon!
- Correct.

55
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,875
Good job. All right. Come on.

56
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,500
- See you Monday.
- Bye, Frank. Thanks.

57
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,083
- Keep your snacks in the kitchen.
- Bye, Mom.

58
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,292
He's really taken to you
in the month you've been with us.

59
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,375
- Likewise.
- Too bad you can't stay on when Tony's back.

60
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,875
It was just a favor.
I don't usually do this sort of a job.

61
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,292
I thought you were a professional driver.

62
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,458
A different kind of driving.

63
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:01,875
Well, we're all gonna miss you
when you're gone.

64
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,958
And...

65
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,750
thank you for what you did.

66
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,042
For what?

67
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,458
For turning the car around so that
Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

68
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,542
- You really know kids, don't you?
- I know fighting.

69
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,250
He hasn't seen Jack in months,

70
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,542
and when he gets back,
all I hear is what I'm doing wrong.

71
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:35,333
You'd think that after being separated
for a year that he would...

72
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,333
I'm sorry. You don't have to hear this.

73
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:46,208
It's OK. For what it's worth,
I think you're doing a great job with Jack.

74
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,917
Thank you.

75
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,833
Any time I can be of help,
if there's anything you need.

76
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,917
That's really sweet of you, Frank.

77
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,917
I might have to take you up on it.

78
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:05,125
I almost forgot. I'm supposed to take Jack to
the doctor tomorrow morning for a checkup,

79
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:10,000
but I'm organizing a party for him, even
though his birthday's not until next week.

80
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:18,375
So, while I decorate and his friends arrive,
I was thinking, if you wouldn't mind...

81
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,875
- I'll take him.
- I feel funny cutting into your weekend.

82
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,167
I'm just picking up a friend at the airport
later on in the day.

83
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,792
- That's nice.
- What is?

84
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,083
The guys on security
say you're a bit of a loner. Um...

85
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:35,875
- So it's just nice to hear you have a friend.
- He's not really a friend.

86
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,375
He's French.

87
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,250
I'll call you back.

88
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,583
Audrey. I'd like to finish our conversation.

89
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,750
If anything comes up before then,
you have my cell.

90
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,042
- Nothing will come up, Mrs. Billings.
- Audrey.

91
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,750
Audrey.

92
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,833
- Yeah, hello?
- Confirmed for tomorrow. 9am.

93
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:24,167
Tomorrow, 9am. Only change -
the driver'll be taking him, not the mother.

94
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,667
Even better.

95
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,958
Vasily?

96
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,625
- Is it stable?
- Yes, it's stable.

97
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,042
And the antidote?

98
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,417
See you tomorrow.

99
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,625
The drug-enforcement ministers
of six Latin American countries

100
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,000
arrived in Miami for a summit meeting...

101
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,500
Yeah. Martin, Frank.
1156 Palmeadow.

102
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:25,583
I'm waiting for an express delivery.
That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.

103
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:29,708
I don't need anything else.
Just get me the pizza.

104
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,583
- I'm not paying for that...
- Hi.

105
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,875
Hi.

106
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:40,500
So, it's one medium pie, no mozzarella,
extra olives and extra anchovies,

107
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:43,000
which amounts to $11.95.

108
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,792
- I hope you're hungry.
- You have no idea.

109
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,167
I apologize for the delay, sir.

110
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,667
Mrs. Billings.

111
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,667
Audrey. Audrey.

112
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,875
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

113
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:06,167
- Have you been drinking?
- A little.

114
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,167
You said if I needed anything.

115
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,333
- I can't.
- Why? Because of who I am?

116
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,042
Because of who I am.

117
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,625
I feel so lost. So confused.

118
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,250
Who isn't?

119
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,833
Thank you, Frank.

120
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,500
For the time and...

121
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,417
your respect.

122
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,417
I think it's what I needed the most.

123
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,500
Bye.

124
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,667
- Am I gonna get a shot?
- I don't know.

125
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:05,125
- Jeez. We're not open yet.
- I need to see the doctor immediately.

126
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,625
Right. Dr. Koblin, if you'll come out here,
please. We have an issue.

127
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,333
You'll have to state the medical problem.

128
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:17,625
Actually, my problem's not medical.
It's psychological.

129
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,417
Yes, Laura. What seems to be the problem?

130
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,125
Me.

131
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,208
I hate shots.

132
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,125
Number one, there's no guarantee
you're getting a shot.

133
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:33,333
There's no sense getting worked up
over something that might not happen.

134
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,917
- Give me the news.
- Doctor said I'm cured.

135
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:46,792
- Frank, it hurts a lot.
- I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot.

136
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,917
- Promise?
- You know my fourth rule?

137
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:54,208
Never make a promise
you can't keep. Come on.

138
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,583
Close the door.

139
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,375
Come on.

140
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,667
- May I help you?
- Jack Billings to see Dr. Koblin.

141
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,667
He's out sick today. He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.

142
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,958
- I like Dr. Koblin.
- Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice.

143
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,250
Just take him into room 3.

144
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,167
- Where's Laura?
- Who?

145
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,958
- You're standing at her desk.
- That Laura. She's out sick too.

146
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,167
There's a lot of flu going around.
Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day.

147
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,458
Come on. It'll be over before you know it.

148
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,958
Hey, hey!

149
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,250
I'm Dr. Tyberg.

150
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,542
Can't I wait for my doctor?

151
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,750
Your doctor was called away
on an emergency.

152
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:56,042
- The nurse said he had the flu.
- That was the emergency.

153
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,542
He came down with flu, very quickly.
So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

154
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:06,208
Come. I show you something very cool.

155
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,833
I'm sorry. Doctor-patient privacy in room.

156
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,333
You can wait in reception area,
or glass of water, or...

157
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,625
Hey, trust me. I am doctor.

158
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,000
Please. It's phone.

159
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:27,000
<i>- Yeah?
- Allô, allô.  Frank? I am here.</i>

160
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:30,083
- You're early.
- Yeah, we had fantastic tailwinds.

161
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,917
Put two hours on my vacation, just like that.

162
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,792
From now on, it's the only way I'm flying.
Tailwinds or nothing.

163
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,875
Glad you made it.

164
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Hello. Sorry, Dr. Dunietz is not in today.
Call back Monday.

165
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm a little tied up. You mind taking a cab?
You have the address, yes?

166
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:02,167
Oh, thank you. I heard the fish down here
is fantastic. I could make us a bouillabaisse.

167
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,083
You like bouillabaisse, Frank, no?

168
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,458
I gotta go.

169
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:09,750
Frank!

170
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,458
Maybe we'll wait for his regular doctor.

171
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:15,167
It's important that he receives immunizations.

172
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,250
- I'm sure. But a week won't make a difference.
- No, we're doing it now.

173
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,417
Get going, Jack!

174
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,833
Look at me. Look at me.

175
00:20:57,042 --> 00:21:00,042
- Remember my promise?
- Yes.

176
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,917
- It's... It's me!
- Get out!

177
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,417
Frank.

178
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,208
Shit.

179
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:13,458
The patient's not cooperating.
Prep the vehicle.

180
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,542
Come on, hurry.

181
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,958
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be OK.

182
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:07,417
- Freeze! Put your guns on the ground!
- Get down!

183
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,125
<i>- Si.
- They got away.</i>

184
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,000
<i>- Cazzo!
- Plan B?</i>

185
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,417
Yes. Plan B.

186
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, you made it.

187
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,875
- Oh, what's that?
- Jack's birthday present.

188
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:44,375
Baseball uniform, cleats, glove and a bat.

189
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,667
- It's his favorite sport.
- It was. Last year.

190
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,792
He's on a soccer team now. He's good.

191
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,458
- You know, you should see him sometime.
- Hello.

192
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:01,958
- Mr. And Mrs. Billings! They're coming!
- Hide, everyone. Hide!

193
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:11,667
- Yes.
- Good morning, Mr. Driver.

194
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:15,542
- Who is this?
- Look in your rear-view mirror and you'll see.

195
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,667
I know what you're thinking.
Bulletproof glass.

196
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,958
So tell me, in your experience - which judging
from the performance you put on in the office

197
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,625
goes way beyond driving children to school -

198
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:31,917
does bulletproof glass stop
a 7.62 armor-piercing round?

199
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,542
Frank, why have you stopped the car?

200
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:41,208
Don't look,
they are triangulated over 300 feet away.

201
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,708
Frank, pick up.

202
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:48,125
You screwed up my plan.
I am going to tell you how to set things right.

203
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:52,000
Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.

204
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,708
Let her in.

205
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,500
Driver.

206
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,875
Good boy. Good boy.

207
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,500
Hi.

208
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Leave it on.

209
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:34,375
Personally, I hate kids. I don't know
what your feelings are on the subject,

210
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:40,083
but if you ever want to have any, make
no moves but the moves I tell you to make.

211
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:45,083
You're in her hands now. They can be gentle
hands, but they can be the hands from hell.

212
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,750
- Trust me on this one.
- Trust him on this one.

213
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:50,958
Now, drive.

214
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Make a left.

215
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,792
I said left.

216
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Listen, we keep doing this your way,
they're gonna catch us.

217
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:05,083
- Do this my way, no one gets hurt.
- Where's the fun in that?

218
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,875
Let's save the fun for later.

219
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,792
Hey!

220
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,375
Not bad.

221
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:04,167
Didn't your mother
teach you to say thank you?

222
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,375
She tried, and failed miserably.

223
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:10,375
- I think we lost them.
- Think again.

224
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:17,458
Thought complete. Let's go.

225
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:52,208
You can't find him? He's one man in one car.
He's a chauffeur, for chrissakes.

226
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,708
Not exactly, sir.
There's a possibility he was in on it.

227
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,708
- That's impossible.
- How would you know?

228
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:03,125
He could have been setting this up the
whole time, and you wouldn't have known.

229
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:07,500
- And you are an expert on knowing people.
- His background.

230
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:13,083
He's ex-Special Forces. Headed a commando
unit. Specialized in search and destroy.

231
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:17,208
Been in and out of Lebanon, Syria, Sudan.
The man is a hunter.

232
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't care what his skills are
or where he's from.

233
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,167
This is not a war zone,
this is an American city!

234
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,583
Where's my son?

235
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,042
Last stop. All out.

236
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:02,833
You're quite a guy.
Another time, another place -

237
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,958
you and me, baby,
the pleasure we could have.

238
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,750
Beauty.

239
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,125
Frank.

240
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,333
Frank!

241
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:23,708
Frank!

242
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:29,000
Not what you expected when you reported
for work this morning, is it, Frank? No?

243
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,333
Is that what passes for wit in this circle?

244
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,208
In this circle, my friend,
wit is not a requirement of the job.

245
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,208
Brutality, yes.
An ability to inflict pain, absolutely.

246
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,083
A certain psychotic, moral ignorance,
blind obedience, all required.

247
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,792
- But not wit. How was it?
- Fun.

248
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,917
Only the beginning, my love.

249
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:56,083
- What's this all about?
- A timely question.

250
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:58,292
Max.

251
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,667
Pardon me.

252
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:12,458
- Hello.
- Put me on the speaker.

253
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:16,667
In the next two hours,
you'll get five million dollars in $100 bills.

254
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:20,750
Put them in a waterproof suitcase,
go to the Bayfront Park - personally.

255
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:25,250
There will be a blue Chrysler parked there.
Place the suitcase in the trunk, and leave.

256
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:28,542
I don't know if I can get
five million dollars in two hours.

257
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,667
I read the newspapers. When you were
appointed to your current position,

258
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,833
your net worth exceeded 100 million dollars,
so you won't even feel the bite.

259
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:40,542
What guarantee do I have
that you won't harm my son?

260
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,750
"Guarantee"? Mr. Billings,
I am not a car dealer.

261
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:48,833
Don't let the charming accent
and my impeccable syntax mislead you.

262
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,750
I live in the jungle, and in the jungle
you either eat or be eaten.

263
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:55,833
But, in the spirit of business,
here is the guarantee.

264
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:59,708
Ten minutes past the deadline,
if the money doesn't arrive, I send a finger.

265
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:03,625
20 minutes, a hand. 30 minutes, a foot.

266
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,542
Sounds like we have a deal.

267
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:09,125
You have a deal.

268
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,917
Could we please speak to our son?

269
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,500
Mommy! Mommy!

270
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:21,792
You have two hours, Mr. Billings.
Starting now.

271
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:27,417
- Just get my son!
- All right. All right.

272
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:31,292
Frank, you promised
you wouldn't let anybody hurt me!

273
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,708
- You promised!
- Never make promises you can't keep.

274
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,292
I don't. It's one of my rules.

275
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,875
Wow.

276
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Bravo. A man who leads his life by rules.
In my world rules are meant to be broken.

277
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:51,792
- Not mine.
- You're gonna have to make an exception.

278
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,083
Go.

279
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,042
<i>Prego. </i>

280
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,042
- Go.
- Hey, driver!

281
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:46,542
No, no, wait, wait.
A little distance between us isn't a bad thing.

282
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,333
<i>Andiamo!</i>

283
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,917
Now.

284
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,375
Hold on. The signal.

285
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,083
- Hello.
- It's me.

286
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,375
- You son of a bitch.
- Look, I had nothing to do with this.

287
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:46,167
- One scratch on his head...
- Let me speak to who's in charge.

288
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:50,042
- This is US Marshal Stappleton.
- Act fast. There are three boats.

289
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:53,542
- Tell us where you are.
- Get a plane. They're heading north.

290
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,750
- Tell me where you are.
- Just tell us where you are!

291
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,833
Hello, Frank?

292
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,542
Got it.

293
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>- Allô.
- Tarconi, it's me. Get out of the house.</i>

294
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:36,292
- I was just putting the Madeleines...
- Forget the Madeleines, just get out.

295
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,125
- And go where?
- Anywhere. Go to the beach.

296
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:42,708
Oh, the beach. The famous Miami Beach.

297
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,917
Oh, my dream.
I would love to go to the beach.

298
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,083
Maybe not.

299
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:55,708
- Freeze! Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the cook.

300
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,292
Oh. This is a mistake. A terrible mistake.

301
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,875
Why we can't all just get along, you know?

302
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,875
- Hello.
- It's Frank. Pretend it's someone else.

303
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,167
Hi, Susan.

304
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,833
No, I'm just here at home.

305
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:38,333
I didn't do it, Audrey.
She had a gun on Jack. I had no choice.

306
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:42,958
Yeah, I saw that. What do you know?

307
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,042
- It's more than a kidnapping.
- They asked for a ransom.

308
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,250
The doctors, they were fake. They were trying
to give Jack a shot. When I interrupted them...

309
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:59,125
I promised Jack I wouldn't let anyone
hurt him. I'm not gonna break that promise.

310
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:01,542
- Frank.
- I'll call you back.

311
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,917
Audrey.

312
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:13,125
- Is everything all right?
- That's a pretty stupid question to ask, Jeff.

313
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:23,583
All right. So tell me again, Inspector Tarconi,

314
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:29,417
why you didn't immediately
identify yourself as a police officer.

315
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, I was overwhelmed
by the effectiveness of your operation,

316
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,583
the sophistication of your equipment.

317
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:43,292
You know, I work in a small office
in a small town. We only have small crimes.

318
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:47,375
- I must admit I was a little insecure.
- You and Frank Martin are friends, right?

319
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:53,458
A friend? Oh, I wouldn't say exactly a friend.
I know him, we have a relationship.

320
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,792
A long relationship?

321
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,667
- Not so long.
- But they found you cooking in his house.

322
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,167
- I'm French!
- So?

323
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:05,250
We don't need to know someone for long time in
order to cook for them. It's our way of breaking the ice.

324
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:10,375
Take, for example, this sandwich
and coffee you so graciously offer me.

325
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:13,833
Well, pardon me to think so,
but it's not very good.

326
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,750
I know it sucks, but what's that
got to do with anything?

327
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,167
Do you have a kitchen?

328
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:22,625
Stay back. Stay back.

329
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,042
Don't move. Smith!

330
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:53,167
Drop it.

331
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,708
Oh, Jesus. What happened?

332
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:25,125
We'll take care of it for you.

333
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:34,000
- Are you sure this safe?
- Look over your shoulder.

334
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,708
We got you covered.

335
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:52,375
As my mother used to say,
a meal is only limited by your imagination.

336
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:55,292
<i>- Crème brûlée et croque monsieur.
- Cream brûlée?</i>

337
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,708
- Crème brûlée.
- Cock?

338
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:59,500
- Croque monsieur.
- Croque monsieur.

339
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,000
<i>- Oui?
- Where are you?</i>

340
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:06,375
- Cooking.
- Cooking. Can you talk?

341
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,792
- Oh, speak of the devil. My mother.
- Mom.

342
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:13,167
Please, do you mind?

343
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:14,875
Thank you.

344
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,958
<i>Oui, Maman. Je suis très bien arrivé. </i>

345
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:21,083
<i>Oui, très très bien, merci. Oui.
Ah, oui, c'est une très jolie ville. </i>

346
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:25,167
- May I ask who you're cooking for?
- For the US marshals.

347
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:30,875
Once they found my badge, they were very
polite. They gave me a coffee and a sandwich.

348
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:33,750
You wouldn't believe what passes
for food in this place, Frank.

349
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:39,250
I am correcting the situation while they wait
for my chief to call back and confirm everything.

350
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:44,333
Of course, that might take a while.
He's never there.

351
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:47,833
- Anything about me?
- They are very interested about you.

352
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:51,833
They want to know where you are.
Where are you?

353
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:55,250
Nowhere for very long. Listen, hold on.

354
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,042
Do you have access to a computer?

355
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,833
Easier than having access
to something decent to eat.

356
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:25,583
- Oh, handsome fellow. Who is he?
- That's what I need to know. Do they have an ID program?

357
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:31,583
Forgive me. I'm not so used to this system.
Back home, there is one computer for ten of us.

358
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,292
So, how is it with you, Frank?

359
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,875
- It's a complicated story.
- Ah, you mean you are in the shit?

360
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:42,083
- You might say that.
- In other words, your natural state.

361
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:43,792
Voilà.

362
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:50,375
A Russian biologist with advanced degrees from
the state laboratory for biological warfare in Siberia.

363
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:56,375
- Do we have an address?
- Miami, Boca West, King Street, number 11.

364
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,458
Get out!

365
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:09,250
Hey!

366
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:16,625
- What are you doing?
- Trying to catch a bus.

367
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:20,708
Come on.

368
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,000
What are you doing, driver?
Not so good on the water, hey?

369
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,917
Stop it! Stop it!

370
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,750
- OK. OK.
- Tell me about the doctor's office.

371
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,250
- What doctor's office?
- Where you tried to stick the kid with this.

372
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,667
You want to tell me?

373
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,542
Do you know what you have done?
Do you know what you have done?

374
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,750
Obviously something not conducive to your good health,
which is all I needed to know in the first place.

375
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,542
Have a good life...

376
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,958
what's left of it.

377
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:08,333
- Outpost to base. The ransom is still there.
- Thanks.

378
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:10,500
The ransom hasn't been picked up.

379
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:13,917
- Don't worry.
- What if it's not just a kidnapping?

380
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:18,708
- I've worked on many kidnapping cases.
- If they don't take it I won't get my son back.

381
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:21,792
Don't make this
any more complicated than it is.

382
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:26,000
I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson.
It's because of your job.

383
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:29,917
- What does my job have to do with this?
- It has everything to do with it.

384
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:33,500
Because you became famous,
we became the targets.

385
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:39,375
No matter what you think, the only one who's
out there trying to get Jack back is Frank.

386
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,167
- The chauffeur?
- You spoke to Frank Martin?

387
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:47,875
- What the hell are you doing talking to him?
- Because he's the last person who saw Jack alive!

388
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,958
We've found the boy.

389
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,750
Hard drive blew.

390
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,833
- Get another one in there.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:23,458
- How long is it gonna take?
- Ma'am, we're going as fast as we can.

392
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,125
- He can suffocate in there.
- Stay calm.

393
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,333
- It's my son!
- Let them work.

394
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:31,417
- Are you gonna sit and do nothing?
- They're experts.

395
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:35,333
Everyone is an expert!
I've had it with all of you!

396
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,042
Audrey!

397
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,833
Audrey!

398
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,708
Audrey!

399
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,000
Audrey!

400
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:55,708
Mommy!

401
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,292
Jack!

402
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,208
Are you OK?

403
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:11,000
There you go, little buddy.

404
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:18,292
Breathe. Come on, breathe.

405
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,875
- You're the devil.
- I wish.

406
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:04,542
- Shit! Dimitri, you scare shit in me.
- Where is Sonovitch?

407
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:07,750
- In chamber.
- I need to speak with him.

408
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:12,042
Sit down! Listen Panasonic.
Is rap music, is good.

409
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,750
- What was that?
- I don't know.

410
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,750
Shit!

411
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,917
- What are you doing?
- I need antidote.

412
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,125
The driver, he inject me with virus. Look!

413
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:06,625
- Dimitri, where would he get the virus?
- The one we left in doctor's surgery.

414
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,625
Please, I need antidote. I am sick.

415
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:13,917
Calm down. You're not sick. You have
four hours before the virus is active.

416
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,417
You know that. You worked on creating it.

417
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:20,000
- Open fridge.
- I'm telling you...

418
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:25,917
<i>Izvinite.  Open fridge. Open the fridge!</i>

419
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:30,417
Yes. Insurance policy. How many you have?

420
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,875
Two doses. Enough for Tipov and myself.

421
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:40,875
Tipov's policy cancelled. There is one for me.

422
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,292
And I want it now. Come on.

423
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,292
Come on. Let's do it!

424
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,375
- Let's not.
- Who are you?

425
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,583
- There is enough for two.
- You don't need it.

426
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:55,375
- But you injected me.
- With water.

427
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,167
- I'm not sick.
- You're not sick.

428
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,083
- Water.
- Water.

429
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,167
Son of bitch!

430
00:54:08,118 --> 00:54:11,451
Good. Our problem is solved.
One dose for each of us.

431
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,520
- It's not for us.

432
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:16,608
- One for you and one for the child.
_ Your devotion is touching.

433
00:54:16,826 --> 00:54:18,494
My patience is about to run out.

434
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:29,264
- Tell me about the virus.
- OK. What do you want know?

435
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:31,139
Everything. For starters, what is it?

436
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:34,556
A recombinant retro-immune
double-polymorphing effluent.

437
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:39,056
The child will die. Anyone he breathes
on will die, and then it's over.

438
00:54:39,347 --> 00:54:43,722
- What do you mean, "It's over?"
- The virus is designed to go inert after 24 hours.

439
00:54:44,056 --> 00:54:47,847
Thanks for the lesson.
Now give me the vials.

440
00:54:48,056 --> 00:54:53,514
You really want to play superhero, don't you?
Well, let's see if you can fly.

441
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:32,389
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

442
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:42,222
There's nothing to worry about. It's just a simple viral
infection combined with the stress of what happened.

443
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:46,139
It should pass in a day or two.
I gave him something to help him sleep.

444
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:50,722
- Call me if anything arises.
- Thank you, Doctor.

445
00:56:52,431 --> 00:56:56,097
You know, Audrey, all this has...

446
00:56:56,389 --> 00:57:00,097
well, it's made me realize
what a fool I've been.

447
00:57:00,306 --> 00:57:02,597
With Jack...

448
00:57:02,806 --> 00:57:05,389
and with you.

449
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:12,806
- Are you OK?
- Mr. Billings. We're running late.

450
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:18,306
I'll be right out.
I'd like to come by after the conference,

451
00:57:18,472 --> 00:57:21,264
check on Jack.

452
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:23,681
Check on you.

453
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:29,056
Good. I'll see you soon.

454
00:57:29,264 --> 00:57:31,556
They're here if you need them.

455
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:47,056
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- I'm fine.

456
00:57:50,556 --> 00:57:53,556
- Hello.
- It's me.

457
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:55,556
- Are you OK?
- Go to your bedroom.

458
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,764
Hi, Susan. How are you?

459
00:58:00,556 --> 00:58:03,639
I'm alone. Where are you, Frank?

460
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,056
Turn around.

461
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,139
Frank, you were wrong.
It was a kidnapping. Jack is fine.

462
00:58:20,306 --> 00:58:25,514
Jack's been infected with a virus. Anyone
who comes into contact with him will die.

463
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:28,222
What are you telling me?

464
00:58:28,431 --> 00:58:32,931
- Are you telling me my son is gonna die?
- No, he's not.

465
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:39,514
Once incubated, the virus becomes airborne,
so anyone he breathes on gets infected.

466
00:58:39,722 --> 00:58:42,514
Your son was a weapon.
The target is his father.

467
00:58:42,722 --> 00:58:47,597
- Jefferson? Well, why?
- Because of the conference. It's the only logical answer.

468
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:51,014
Every drug-enforcement agency
in the hemisphere, in one room.

469
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:54,306
Your husband breathes, the room dies.

470
00:59:00,264 --> 00:59:02,889
You gotta trust me, Audrey.

471
00:59:10,056 --> 00:59:12,472
Can you get to him?

472
00:59:12,764 --> 00:59:15,681
- What are you gonna do?
- Find the guy responsible.

473
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:19,181
He has more of this.
For you and everybody else.

474
00:59:21,181 --> 00:59:23,472
For you now.

475
00:59:39,931 --> 00:59:40,931
We have a guest.

476
00:59:42,847 --> 00:59:46,056
- You're burning up.
- I'm OK.

477
00:59:46,222 --> 00:59:48,556
You gotta go. Go.

478
00:59:52,014 --> 00:59:53,347
Don't move!

479
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:40,597
- Is the governor here?
- Everybody's gonna be here.

480
01:00:40,764 --> 01:00:43,972
The govenor, delegates
from all over the world.

481
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:47,597
- Just a second. Hello.
- Jefferson, you can't go to the conference.

482
01:00:47,764 --> 01:00:51,056
- Is everything all right?
... to give him a deadly virus...

483
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:54,472
- Audrey, I can't hear you. I'm inside.
- Now I've got it, and so do you.

484
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:58,181
- Audrey, I can't hear you.
- Their plan is to infect everyone at the conference.

485
01:00:58,472 --> 01:01:01,264
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Jeff!

486
01:01:03,347 --> 01:01:06,556
Mr. Billings, are you all right?

487
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:10,056
- I'm all right. Come on, let's go.
- You sure?

488
01:01:30,514 --> 01:01:33,639
<i>- Allô.
- You still a guest of the government?</i>

489
01:01:33,847 --> 01:01:38,806
They gave me the five-star accommodation.
Let me guess - you need my help.

490
01:01:39,222 --> 01:01:41,639
Are you near the computer?

491
01:01:41,806 --> 01:01:45,139
It's practically my pillow.
So, how do you want to start?

492
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:51,722
- I don't know. I have nothing.
- Ah. My favorite type of investigation.

493
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:55,014
<i>Let's see. Alors. </i>

494
01:01:55,722 --> 01:01:58,889
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce you to my delegates...

495
01:01:59,222 --> 01:02:03,681
Breathe. That's right,
breathe, my friend, breathe.

496
01:02:04,014 --> 01:02:07,181
Tomorrow, once these
bastards are out of the way

497
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:12,306
and their co-operation agreements are dead and buried,
you know what the biggest problem is going to be?

498
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:15,389
- What?
- Counting the money.

499
01:02:20,097 --> 01:02:22,681
- I can't wait for tomorrow.
- Ay-ay-ay!

500
01:02:27,097 --> 01:02:30,264
Aah. Gianni Chellini.

501
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:35,264
Hires himself out to anyone looking to make
trouble like the Red Brigade, Shining Path.

502
01:02:37,472 --> 01:02:40,972
Someone accessed a database
on the 15th floor.

503
01:02:41,264 --> 01:02:45,264
That's Gonzalez. He's on vacation.

504
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:50,264
Was behind the hostage-taking
of the OPEC ministers in Geneva.

505
01:02:50,556 --> 01:02:52,931
It was a nice piece of work.

506
01:02:57,431 --> 01:02:59,639
- Give me an address.
- Miami, East Highland,

507
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:02,056
Pelican Drive, number 26900.

508
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:05,139
- We've found the car.
- You're one great cop, Tarconi.

509
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:09,222
Thank you for the compliment.
Now I'm going back to sleep.

510
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:14,514
Hm. Maybe not.

511
01:03:16,931 --> 01:03:20,014
- Bumbaclaat, man! Move out the way!
- Move over.

512
01:03:20,222 --> 01:03:22,306
I'll do ya!

513
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,431
Mommy.

514
01:03:33,597 --> 01:03:38,014
- Honey. You feeling better?
- A little bit.

515
01:03:38,306 --> 01:03:41,597
Why don't you try to go back to sleep, OK?

516
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:49,681
Ma'am, are you all right?

517
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:02,389
Jefferson. Jefferson, are you OK?

518
01:05:07,097 --> 01:05:09,306
OK, do it.

519
01:05:21,806 --> 01:05:25,806
- What are you doing?
- You know, last night got me thinking.

520
01:05:26,014 --> 01:05:28,514
How do we transport the antidote safely?

521
01:05:28,806 --> 01:05:32,181
We need something that won't break.
Something that can't be stolen.

522
01:05:32,389 --> 01:05:36,306
Something totally secure. Me.

523
01:05:42,389 --> 01:05:45,597
Impressive. Get dressed.

524
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:48,389
Stop him.

525
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:53,972
- These your friends?
- Not yet.

526
01:06:03,764 --> 01:06:06,347
- Where'd they go?
- The garage.

527
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:09,764
- I'm out of ammo.
- Me too.

528
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:11,972
- So am I.
- Where are the reloads?

529
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:13,639
The garage.

530
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:17,639
Check the house. Go, go, go!

531
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:23,639
Get him! Get him!

532
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:20,404
- What d'you want me to do?
- Keep the meter running.

533
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:25,821
Bye. Don't worry, baby.
You're safe now. You're safe.

534
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:29,987
You're so beautiful.
Remind me of my yellow poom-poom rider.

535
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:48,404
Don't move.

536
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:51,612
- Oh, Mr. Driver.
- I'll blow you into tomorrow.

537
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:55,612
But then I'll bleed what you came for all over
the floor. You wouldn't want this, would you?

538
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:59,487
Not after you worked so hard
trying to get to the antidote.

539
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,196
Take a good look, Frank Martin.

540
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:05,904
I'm a cure for what ails you.
I'm the only cure for what ails you.

541
01:10:06,196 --> 01:10:09,279
I am the antidote.

542
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:12,696
But nice try. I'm impressed.
I didn't give you enough credit.

543
01:10:12,987 --> 01:10:16,987
- It took more than a driver to figure this out.
- I haven't figured it all out yet.

544
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:20,487
Perhaps I can help you.
What part are you a little thick on?

545
01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:23,987
- You. Why?
- Oh.

546
01:10:24,196 --> 01:10:30,071
That's the easy part. It's a business deal, pure
and simple. I'm for hire to the highest bidder.

547
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:33,862
In this case, the highest bidder
was the Colombian cocaine cartels

548
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:37,362
that wanted these pesky lawmen
off their backs.

549
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:40,946
You really think killing all these politicians
is going to make things easier for them?

550
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:44,446
That's not my problem.
I was hired to do a job.

551
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:49,237
I did the job, like you. Just my pay is better.

552
01:10:50,571 --> 01:10:53,237
My hair and my suit, too.

553
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:57,362
Oh, Lola.

554
01:10:57,529 --> 01:11:00,946
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a plane to catch.

555
01:11:02,029 --> 01:11:04,362
Kill him.

556
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,237
<i>Ciao, ciao. </i>

557
01:11:10,154 --> 01:11:12,529
- Don't even blink.
- What's in this for you?

558
01:11:12,737 --> 01:11:14,737
Pleasure...

559
01:11:17,237 --> 01:11:20,112
in killing you.

560
01:12:55,946 --> 01:12:58,529
We're coming to you live
from the Key Biscayne causeway

561
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:02,821
where at least ten police cars are in
hot pursuit of a stolen red pick-up truck.

562
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:10,404
Oh, my. This is just nuts.
Jim, are you getting that?

563
01:13:10,612 --> 01:13:15,196
There's another car that is swaying
past the police, as if they were standing still.

564
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:19,196
- Son of a bitch can drive. Whoo.
- Yes, he can.

565
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:07,946
We have clearance for takeoff.

566
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:13,071
Sit back, enjoy your flight, and
we will be in Colombia before you know it.

567
01:14:57,404 --> 01:15:00,404
We have a problem with the landing gear.
I need to land.

568
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:02,904
- Can we fly with the problem?
- Theoretically.

569
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:06,779
Then you'll land when we get to Colombia.

570
01:15:07,112 --> 01:15:09,696
Go and see if you can lift it manually.

571
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:13,279
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Nothing to worry about.

572
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:20,987
Sorry, flight's been cancelled.

573
01:15:21,196 --> 01:15:24,696
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been cancelled.

574
01:15:24,862 --> 01:15:27,862
Have a seat.

575
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:31,196
Relax.

576
01:15:31,362 --> 01:15:34,362
Drink something.
Let's get to know each other.

577
01:15:34,487 --> 01:15:37,862
I think I know everything I need to know.

578
01:17:26,055 --> 01:17:28,055
Shit.

579
01:19:07,472 --> 01:19:11,847
Five points. What has eyes
but no ears, skin but no hair,

580
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:13,930
it's white inside and brown outside?

581
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:16,055
- Mom?
- A worm?

582
01:19:16,264 --> 01:19:19,847
- Wrong. Dad?
- A caterpillar.

583
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:22,930
- Wrong.
- A potato.

584
01:19:27,014 --> 01:19:30,139
- May I help you?
- I was just leaving.

585
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:35,639
- Coconut.
- Wrong.

586
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:39,305
- A snake.
- Wrong.

587
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:42,722
- A peanut.
- Yuck!

588
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:45,097
- A hot dog.
- Wrong.

589
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:00,305
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

590
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:06,889
- Didn't want you to miss your plane.
- That's very thoughtful of you.

591
01:20:14,972 --> 01:20:17,264
Check it out, my man.

592
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,472
You won't believe
what happened to me last night.

593
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:32,555
I have something for you.
Since you never got to the beach.

594
01:20:32,889 --> 01:20:38,055
Oh, you know, water's water, sand is sand.
Here, there - it's all the same.

595
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:40,472
Flight 069 to Paris.

596
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,555
Thank you, Frank.
It was an interesting vacation.

597
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:46,972
- What more could one ask for?
- Ah, yeah.

598
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:51,764
<i>- Au revoir, Frank.
- Au revoir, my friend. Have a good flight.</i>

599
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,347
I doubt it. They said it is all headwinds.

600
01:20:54,555 --> 01:20:58,347
I guess we can't have
everything we wish for, can we?

601
01:20:59,139 --> 01:21:01,430
No, we can't.

602
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:17,514
Yeah.

603
01:21:17,722 --> 01:21:20,514
I'm looking for a transporter.

604
01:21:24,097 --> 01:21:25,805
I'm listening.
