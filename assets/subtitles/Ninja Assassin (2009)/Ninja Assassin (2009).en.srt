1
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:53,818
Fuck!

2
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,592
Fucking-shit!

3
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,589
Fuck!

4
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,912
Agh, fucking-fuck!

5
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:08,725
Watch it, old man!

6
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:19,118
What the fuck?
You're doing it wrong.

7
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:23,182
The needle is doing
what the needle does.

8
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,635
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

9
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,228
The Irezumi does not hide the skin,

10
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:30,691
The tattoo reveals the nature of the man

11
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,034
and illuminates the four noble professions

12
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:35,016
in the Book of Five Rings:

13
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:38,851
the Warrior, the Artist,
the Merchant, and the farmer.

14
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,664
If there is a conflict between
the needle and the skin,

15
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:44,167
between the mark and the man,

16
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:49,463
perhaps the path you have chosen is not
the path for which you are suited.

17
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:53,208
What did you just say, old man?
Huh?

18
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:56,522
I know you didn't just
disrespect me, did you?

19
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:58,294
You that fucking stupid?

20
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:02,949
You disrespect me, and I'll tattoo
this ceiling with your fucking brains!

21
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,074
No disrespect.

22
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,017
You're lucky.

23
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,492
I can't kill you
until you finish this thing.

24
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:17,046
Gimme that mirror!

25
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,948
See how it's looking?

26
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:20,690
Not bad.

27
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,143
Hey, boss.
This just came for you.

28
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,465
What is it?

29
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:25,626
A letter.

30
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:27,728
So open it, dumb ass.

31
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:34,186
What?
What is it?

32
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,470
Looks like sand.

33
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,855
Yup. Sand.
Black Sand.

34
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:43,717
No...

35
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,522
You know what this is?

36
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,595
Hey, you wanna let us in on the joke?

37
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:54,550
Years ago,  I watched a man
open an envelope like that one.

38
00:02:55,481 --> 00:03:00,677
There were many with him
and they laughed as you laugh now.

39
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:08,566
Then it came from the shadows
and their laughter was drowned in blood.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,733
What came out of the shadows?

41
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,245
I cannot say the word.

42
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,807
What word?

43
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:25,506
That night,
one of their blades struck here.

44
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:29,091
I should have died,
but for an accident of birth.

45
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,905
My heart is here,
on the other side.

46
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,722
What the fuck is that?

47
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:41,025
Looks like a Ninja, boss.

48
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:44,819
A ninja?
Are you kidding me?

49
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:48,203
That's the word you're afraid to say?
Ninja?

50
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,896
Ninja-Ninja-Ninja!

51
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:54,711
You old fuck!
You had me going!

52
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,784
Ninja.
That's some good shit.

53
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,726
You wanna fuck with me?

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,422
You wanna fuck with me?

55
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,260
Fuck!

56
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:16,187
Look...
you don't have to do this!

57
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:19,360
Whatever they are paying you,

58
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,974
I'll double it!
I'll triple it!

59
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,628
You hear me!
I'll pay you whatever you want!

60
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:29,663
You cannot bargain with it.
You cannot reason with it because...

61
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,865
it is not a human being

62
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,979
It is a demon sent
straight from the hell.

63
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,851
You shut your face old man!

64
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,052
I'll blow your ...

65
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:02,952
For fifty-seven-years,
I’ve told your story...

66
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:05,455
No one ever believed me.

67
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:08,188
But you are real,
aren’t you?

68
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:30,514
Is all that for the Delgata case?

69
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,147
This is Delgata.

70
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,370
- And the rest?
- Evidence.

71
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,882
For?

72
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,224
No. Not again.
Mika, please.

73
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,677
What's the problem?
You’ve trusted my research before.

74
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:42,699
All right, here's a question for you.

75
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,761
Which of these words does not
belong in this sentence:

76
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:49,146
laptops, space shuttles,
nanotechnology, ninjas.

77
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,959
All I’m asking for is an hour.

78
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,561
That’s all.

79
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,696
Why do I think
I’m going to regret this?

80
00:06:58,207 --> 00:06:59,378
You remember the Eulmi incident?

81
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:02,602
Korean queen, late eighteen-hundreds.
Killed by one of these ninja clans.

82
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:04,404
Ozunu.
I think.

83
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:07,268
Now I’ve been going through
the original transcripts

84
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:10,261
of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki.

85
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:14,816
The prosecutor questioned Shigeaki
about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.

86
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:18,270
Shigeaki answered that he didn’t know
what the prosecutor was talking about.

87
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,333
The question was never brought up again.

88
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:24,007
But what pinged for me was the amount-
the exact same amount

89
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:27,491
rumored to be paid to the Ozunu Clan
for the Yakuza massacre

90
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,864
that happened last week in Osaka.

91
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:32,027
So you start to wonder,
in this ever changing world,

92
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,079
if the cost of a man’s life
has remains the same.

93
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,184
Exactly. And I figure these clans
are like what? A thousand years old?

94
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:39,976
They probably don’t change a lot.

95
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,630
So I started looking at
international wire transfers,

96
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:48,246
targeting banks in the regions
of several high-profile assassinations

97
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,149
and bingo -
Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.

98
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,182
The day before the assassination

99
00:07:53,232 --> 00:08:00,801
$1,555,999.90 was transferred
from the bank of Shanghai.

100
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:05,456
That is the exact market equivalent
of one hundred pounds of gold.

101
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:08,239
Okay you got me.
This is interesting.

102
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,182
The clans are real, Ryan.

103
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:13,415
They steal children
and turn them into assassins.

104
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:15,958
Yeah. Look Mika, no one's denying
the historical facts.

105
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,461
But this whole thing just doesn't make
sense anymore in modern world.

106
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:20,834
They’re real.
I mean you can call them spooks,

107
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:23,307
or assassins, or whatever you want
if it makes you feel better,

108
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,711
but they are out there
and they are killing people

109
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:30,145
and nobody is doing
a damn thing to stop them.

110
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:38,665
Hi. Excuse me.

111
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,938
Would you mind?

112
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:45,023
If it's not too much trouble,
could you help me with this?

113
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,103
What clan are you from?

114
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:04,956
What are you doing in Berlin?

115
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:07,209
I don't understand.

116
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,432
No!

117
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,786
What's going on?

118
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:48,197
- So you said you found something?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:51,241
I was digging around try to see what I
could come up with and I found this.

120
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,084
A report. A friend of mine
in Moscow, tipped me to it.

121
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:55,986
It was written during
the height of the Cold War

122
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:59,490
by a high ranking KGB agent
named Aleksei Sabatin.

123
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:03,145
In it he raises the possibility
that number of political assassinations

124
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:05,948
were conducted by an ancient
but very sophisticated network

125
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:08,201
he calls the Nine Clans.

126
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:10,974
Mind you,
he doesn’t call them ninjas.

127
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,076
What happened to him?

128
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:16,741
Same thing that’s going to happen to me,
if I hang around with you---

129
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,195
Kicked out of the service
for mental instability.

130
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,148
You believe it now, don’t you?

131
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:26,372
Ninjas?
You gotta be joking.

132
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,065
Well then, why are you doing all this?

133
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:30,367
I don't know.

134
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,669
But I can guarantee you
it has nothing to do with the fact

135
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:37,175
that you’re the most attractive
researcher I have ever worked with.

136
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:51,301
Oh, Mr. Nan, good, you're back.

137
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:55,536
We had a heating problem,
and I had to go into your apartment.

138
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:59,191
- Is it all right?
- It's all fixed.

139
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,854
You keep it very dark and bare in there.

140
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:05,858
And forgive me but I couldn't
help noticing in your suitcases.

141
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,754
I told you
my father was a very sick man.

142
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,496
Do you have to leave Berlin soon?

143
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,370
Not yet.
But I'm expecting a phone call.

144
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,572
I'm sorry to hear that.

145
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:21,046
One day death will come for us all.

146
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:44,964
Wherever you are,
wherever you may go,

147
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,577
you must never forget who you are,
how you came to be.

148
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:59,261
You are Ozunu.

149
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:03,917
You are a part of me
as I am part of you.

150
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:11,806
This is the truth of your lives
and it will remain true after death.

151
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,881
This is my new son.

152
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,405
I have given him the name Raizo.

153
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:23,260
Welcome him as your brother.

154
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,152
"Welcome Raizo"

155
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:49,190
The body must obey the will.

156
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:53,425
Hunger and thirst,
even the blood in your veins,

157
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,778
are the body’s weaknesses.

158
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:08,553
Master them,
and you master the self.

159
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:19,205
This is the power of the Ozunu clan.

160
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,619
This is the way of the ninja.

161
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:27,455
Eat tonight and you work
twice as hard tomorrow.

162
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,760
What is the lesson?

163
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:00,304
Look at your brother.

164
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,026
Life is combat.

165
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,110
You know this truth.

166
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,843
Abandoned by your parents.

167
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,955
Without a home.

168
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:12,238
Without people to care for you.

169
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:14,340
You should have died.

170
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,853
But, instead you fought.

171
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:21,249
As you did here today.
You fought, and you won.

172
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,092
In combat.
You faced your enemy.

173
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:26,667
Without doubt.
Without thinking or remorse.

174
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:32,462
To survive, you must
learn to feel nothing at all.

175
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:00,555
Pain breeds weakness.

176
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,878
Remember suffering exists
only because weakness exists.

177
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:33,554
You must hate all weakness.

178
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:38,069
Hate it in others,
but most of all hate it in yourself.

179
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,494
- Mrs. Sabatin?
- Yeah.

180
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:36,198
I'm Mika Corretti with Europol.
We spoke on the phone.

181
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,474
You said you read
my husband's report, yes?

182
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,026
Yes.

183
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:47,952
I understand the report caused some
problems for him within the KGB.

184
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:51,026
The report caused "problems"
for Alexei's career

185
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:54,450
the way Moses
caused problems for the Pharaoh.

186
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,951
Very unpleasant.

187
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,323
What happened?

188
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:59,626
About two years ago,

189
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,359
after the assassination of Zhukov,

190
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,712
the report drew attention.

191
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:09,177
After that,
everything was different.

192
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:15,064
Alexei hired men to change all the locks,
and put in more of them.

193
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:18,288
Locks on the windows, locks on
the doors, locks on the locks.

194
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:21,792
He put in cameras and motion sensors
and lights.

195
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:24,445
Everywhere, lights.

196
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:27,679
"There can be no shadows," he said.

197
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,183
"No shadows."

198
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:35,318
Then, one day, a man came to the door.

199
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:39,022
They talked in Alexei’s study for
sometime and then...

200
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,205
the young man left.

201
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:46,120
My husband was a soldier.
A member of Russian Intelligence.

202
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:50,105
He wasn't a man to frighten easy.

203
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:54,290
But when I came to the door,
in his eyes I saw fear.

204
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:56,628
And then he stood up. 

205
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:01,731
He kissed me and told me 
that he loved me very much.

206
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:05,974
He said...

207
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:10,719
I should always remember that.

208
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:14,774
Do you know what they talked about?

209
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:18,148
No.
He said it was safer that way.

210
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,063
Can I ask how he died?

211
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,278
The lights went out.

212
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:36,830
You are the first person who has
taken my husband's work seriously.

213
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:42,797
It would be good to know
that he did not die without cause.

214
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,542
He would want you to have this.

215
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:52,489
Who are you?

216
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:18,961
Go!

217
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:51,619
Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?

218
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,822
You think this is pain?

219
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:55,864
You are mistaken.

220
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:14,446
That is true pain.

221
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,422
Here is your test, Raizo.
Survive the night.

222
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:24,168
Very good, Raizo.
Very good.

223
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:38,696
Oh you're like a dog with a bone
on that computer, aren't you?

224
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:40,748
Excuse me?

225
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,651
Agent Zabranski.
Internal Affairs.

226
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:47,706
Need to ask you
a couple of questions.

227
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,219
You are Mika Coretti, yeah?

228
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,632
Forensic researcher.

229
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,786
You work a lot with an Agent Maslow.
That right?

230
00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:57,688
A few cases.
Yeah.

231
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,962
You have something of
a social relationship.

232
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:01,913
Excuse me?

233
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:06,208
You had lunch with him on the 13th
and again on the 18th.

234
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:09,201
How do you know that?

235
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:10,813
Isn't it true?

236
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:13,801
I’m not sure.
We do have lunch together sometimes,

237
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,861
but that's usually when we’re working.

238
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,054
Has Agent Maslow seemed
different to you lately, in any way?

239
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:23,689
Has he said or done anything
that struck you as unusual?

240
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,811
No, why.

241
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:29,505
Has Agent Maslow
done something?

242
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:31,237
Just routine.

243
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:34,291
The agency cares about
its field operatives.

244
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:39,507
We monitor for signs of stress,
fatigue, mental exhaustion.

245
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:43,562
Agent Maslow has
a serious case load.

246
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:49,159
That much work
can wear on a man, huh?

247
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:56,978
Zabranski came to my office.
- Yeah. I got a surprise visit too.

248
00:25:57,028 --> 00:26:00,532
He made it real clear, Ryan.
They're watching us.

249
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,638
I don't get full picture quite yet,
but I know warning when I see one.

250
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:08,191
- But why?
- Why? It's obvious.

251
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,815
If this little fantasy of yours has
any chance of being real,

252
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:15,930
then these Clans is gonna have some
pretty major juice protecting them.

253
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,792
So what are you going to do?

254
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,366
We are going to tip-toe,
very carefully from here on in.

255
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:24,951
You understand? You do nothing
without checking with me first.

256
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,462
Got it?
- Uh, huh.

257
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:28,124
Got it.

258
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,156
The 14th century scroll refers
to one of the oldest of the Nine Clans,

259
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:57,659
as the clan of Black Sand.

260
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:03,346
The Islamic explorer Ibn Battuta
journeyed with a group of orphans

261
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:06,289
that were being taken
to a remote Shido.

262
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:08,993
hidden amongst snow-capped mountains.

263
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:14,809
Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner
followed by a display of martial skill.

264
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,355
The combatants were children
neither beyond the age of ten.

265
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:24,791
His host explains that a man’s life
must be made meaningless

266
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:27,454
compared to the life of the Clan.

267
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:31,429
Own the meaning of a man’s life
and you own his heart.

268
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:06,861
You shouldn't do that.
It's against the rules.

269
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:09,634
- If they catch you---
- Then they catch me.

270
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:11,847
They'll put you in the box.

271
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:16,102
I believe the heart of the tree
knows which way it needs to grow.

272
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:19,546
Trees don't have hearts.

273
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:21,748
Everything has a heart.

274
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,451
I don't.

275
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:27,815
Really?
Let me see.

276
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:34,583
Hello?

277
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:42,282
It’s saying hello back.
And that it’s happy to meet me...

278
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:44,295
but it misses you.

279
00:28:45,176 --> 00:28:46,277
Liar.

280
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:48,029
I’m not lying.

281
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:49,991
Listen to mine.

282
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:42,023
For an entire year, you shall live
without one of your senses,

283
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:45,647
beginning with the sense
you rely on the most.

284
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:09,045
You must see with more
than your eyes.

285
00:32:31,112 --> 00:32:32,864
Cut him Kiriko.

286
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:36,618
All failure must be sown into the flesh.

287
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,672
Cut him!

288
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:59,405
You know the law.

289
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:19,710
I told you.
I tried to warn you.

290
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:24,495
Yes.
You did.

291
00:34:26,317 --> 00:34:30,082
Why Kiriko?
Why?

292
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:39,343
Why am I in here?
Or why are you out there?

293
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:36,660
Kiriko!

294
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:40,074
Why are you doing this?

295
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:42,347
I have to.

296
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:46,702
You know the law.
He will cut your heart from your chest.

297
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:51,818
No.
He can never touch my heart.

298
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,164
Come with me.

299
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,567
Where?
What is out there?

300
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:19,150
Life.

301
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:26,078
My life is here.

302
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:33,198
Fucking Christ, Ryan---

303
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:37,653
I'm sorry I couldn’t talk earlier, Mika.
They’re watching me. Get in.

304
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:47,544
Ryan, where have you been?
I've been calling your office all day.

305
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:49,817
Now I know
how Sabatin must have felt.

306
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:50,728
What happened?

307
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:54,222
Right now I've got internal affairs,
Homeland Security, the CIA,

308
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,076
and for all I know the
fucking Martian Military in my office

309
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,328
tearing the place apart.

310
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:00,800
What are we going to do?

311
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,523
You are going to go home.
Pack your bags and go on holiday.

312
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,165
- No way.
- Don’t argue with me, Mika.

313
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:06,937
I trusted you.
Now you’ve got to trust me.

314
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:09,170
I'm sorry. I can’t let you lose
your job because of me, Ryan.

315
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,172
I’m not talking about
losing my job.

316
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:15,648
Take this. It’s clean.
Untraceable. No serial number

317
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:17,770
Ryan...

318
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,092
Yeah. I know.

319
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:21,414
I’ve investigated,
world bank organizations,

320
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:25,769
drug cartels, arms dealers,
and I’ve never faced this kind of heat.

321
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,314
For ninjas.
Fucking unbelievable!

322
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,269
Excuse me.

323
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,774
- Hey.
- Hi.

324
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:40,277
So, what's going on?

325
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:44,832
Power's out. Us, the building behind us,
and that one across the street.

326
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:49,117
Seems like every few months,
boom, the lights out.

327
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,890
Okay.

328
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,033
Thanks.

329
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,001
Resync and editing by majtjk0ng

330
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:13,387
More will come.

331
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,198
What?

332
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:16,460
They won’t stop
until you are dead.

333
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,012
Oh, God.

334
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:20,395
The gun won’t help you.

335
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,768
Well I don’t have a lot of options, okay.

336
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:24,310
I once took a Tae Bo class,

337
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,403
but that’s the extent of
my Kung Fu abilities, right?

338
00:41:27,453 --> 00:41:30,827
I can help you
but you have to trust me.

339
00:41:35,783 --> 00:41:37,285
Okay.

340
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:55,546
Do you know me?

341
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:58,960
How?

342
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:05,358
Security camera in New York,
recorded you fighting with one of them.

343
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,711
You know about them?

344
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:11,055
A little.
Nine Clans.

345
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:16,511
And apparently they've been supplying
assassins to governments

346
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,745
or anyone who has
a hundred pounds of gold

347
00:42:19,795 --> 00:42:22,198
for the last thousand years.

348
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:24,621
His name was Jin.

349
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:28,275
You knew him?

350
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,768
He was not born an “Assassin”.

351
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,920
You’re from his Clan?

352
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,003
Then why did you stop him?

353
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,555
They're coming.

354
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:38,107
Who?

355
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,379
Run little brother.
Run.

356
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:10,224
Weakness compels strength.

357
00:43:10,725 --> 00:43:13,208
Betrayal begets blood.

358
00:43:13,478 --> 00:43:16,181
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

359
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:48,219
We have been betrayed.

360
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:52,404
A child of mine, my daughter,
betrayed us.

361
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:55,097
She refused my gifts.

362
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:57,280
Rejected our clan.

363
00:43:58,862 --> 00:44:02,186
Her shame can only be purged with blood.

364
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:04,759
You...

365
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:13,148
You my son who returned her
shall have this honor.

366
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:01,586
Where are we going?

367
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,548
Doesn't matter.

368
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:06,181
Do you think they’re following us?

369
00:45:06,231 --> 00:45:08,003
I know they’re following us.

370
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:10,656
I don’t see anything back there.

371
00:45:10,706 --> 00:45:12,618
They have our scent.

372
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,971
Following our scent?
Like dogs?

373
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:17,204
No.
Like Wolves.

374
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:23,491
My name is Mika by the way.

375
00:45:25,313 --> 00:45:28,667
Raizo is the name I was given.

376
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:31,821
So, you're an orphan?

377
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:38,639
If it’s okay with you, I’m gonna try
and fill in some of the blanks here.

378
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,825
So you must have been taken by the
Ozunu Clan, trained to be an assassin,

379
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:47,690
but something happened and
you decided to opt out of the program.

380
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,593
Now I don’t imagine
that went over so well

381
00:45:50,643 --> 00:45:52,796
and since they’re after me for
just peeking through the keyhole,

382
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:55,629
they must be after you
in like a major way.

383
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,923
But you are also after them
which is why you are in Berlin.

384
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,726
Because Sabatin is one of
the few people pursuing the Clan,

385
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:04,430
which is why they took him out.

386
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:08,705
But here’s a question
I can’t answer:

387
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:12,048
Why did you save me?

388
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,484
Your entire life has brought you
to this moment.

389
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:28,668
Do not fail yourself.

390
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:31,962
Do not fail your family.

391
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:38,339
He is wearing a gold watch.
Bring it to me.

392
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:21,250
That kinda tickled...

393
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:31,862
It's gonna take more than
a knitting needle to fuck me up, boy.

394
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:08,516
Keep it.

395
00:49:08,787 --> 00:49:11,780
It will remind you that
every moment of your life

396
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,433
is a gift that I have given you.

397
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,741
You have made me proud, my son.

398
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:26,708
Now the time must come for you
to prove you are true Ozunu.

399
00:49:34,337 --> 00:49:36,840
She tried to get away from us.

400
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,543
From her family.

401
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:46,151
Takeshi caught her
and return her to us.

402
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,851
Weakness compels strength.

403
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:53,669
Betrayal begets blood.

404
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:08,187
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

405
00:51:31,695 --> 00:51:32,866
You need protection.

406
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:36,991
No. I want Ozunu.
And I need your help to get him.

407
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:42,468
Exit here.

408
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:52,099
You are a size 36?

409
00:51:52,149 --> 00:51:54,842
What? No! Size 34.

410
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:04,714
If you leave while I am gone
they will hunt you and kill you.

411
00:52:04,764 --> 00:52:06,666
Do you understand?

412
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:29,453
Get undressed.
Shower, but do not use soap.

413
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:31,425
Do you smoke?

414
00:52:32,787 --> 00:52:35,039
Put your clothes in here.

415
00:52:37,743 --> 00:52:40,296
These jeans are a little tight.

416
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:42,238
You said 34.

417
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:48,355
Yeah, well it's German sizes.
They must run a little small I guess.

418
00:52:54,232 --> 00:52:57,125
This is for a scent.
Right?

419
00:52:58,057 --> 00:52:59,558
Let's go.

420
00:53:04,424 --> 00:53:05,736
- Yeah?
- Ryan, it’s me.

421
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,958
Mika! For Christ sake
I’ve been calling you for hours!

422
00:53:08,008 --> 00:53:09,420
I know.
I’m in a bit of trouble---

423
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,442
Trouble? Listen, you miss jury
service, you’re in trouble.

424
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:13,495
You’re in deepest shit
that you've ever been in.

425
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:15,577
Yeah, well, at least
I’m not down here by myself.

426
00:53:15,627 --> 00:53:17,900
Sabatin's guy?
The one from the tape? Is he with you?

427
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:22,415
He’s on our side, Ryan. He wants Ozunu,
but he needs the Agency's help.

428
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,037
Be careful, Mika.

429
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:24,928
I trust him.

430
00:53:24,978 --> 00:53:27,251
All right, look...
I can't make any promises

431
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:29,444
but if he cooperates
I'll do what I can.

432
00:53:29,494 --> 00:53:31,546
- Can you meet us?
- Where?

433
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:33,989
How about the usual?

434
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:41,938
There he is.

435
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,864
It’s all right.
He's a good guy.

436
00:53:49,137 --> 00:53:52,290
- Mika, you're okay?
- Yeah. Thanks to him.

437
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:56,015
- Why have you done this?
- Done what?

438
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:57,867
People will die.

439
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:14,467
Move it.

440
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,929
What the fuck are you doing?

441
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,012
Following orders.

442
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:23,477
Prisoner is secure sir.

443
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:24,829
Right.

444
00:54:24,879 --> 00:54:27,892
He sure doesn't like
a killing machine to me, sir

445
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:30,746
He looks like he belongs in a boy band.

446
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:34,290
He couldn't have hurt us.
Could he?

447
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,992
- Sir.

448
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:38,044
Ryan, this is wrong!

449
00:54:38,395 --> 00:54:41,598
I mean it can’t be legal!
What is this place?

450
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:43,971
Your private Guantanamo?

451
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:47,836
It’s an old GDR safe house.
Jamison wants this off the grid.

452
00:54:47,886 --> 00:54:50,339
You’re making a huge mistake.

453
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,331
I don’t think so.

454
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:56,286
I got reports from London, Washington,
and Osaka all tagging your boy.

455
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:58,839
The only problem we have is
where to extradite him first.

456
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:01,252
So two weeks ago,
there’s no such thing as a ninja

457
00:55:01,302 --> 00:55:04,515
and now every city in the
world has a warrant for one?

458
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:06,308
He’s not the enemy.

459
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:09,621
He’s a killer, Mika. Weren’t you the one
telling me it was our job to stop him.

460
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:11,023
You’re not even listening to me!

461
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:12,415
'Cause you’re not saying
anything worth hearing.

462
00:55:12,465 --> 00:55:14,337
Look, you wanna do
the insubordination tango,

463
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:17,741
let’s go,
but not in front of the children okay?

464
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,286
Boys get out!

465
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:24,849
Come on! Let's go! Out!

466
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,943
Damn it, Ryan, I'm just trying---

467
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:30,897
Listen to me,
we don't have much time.

468
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:32,849
I don't know
what we've stumbled into here,

469
00:55:32,899 --> 00:55:35,292
but somebody is pulling
some major strings inside.

470
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:38,996
They want him dead.
He’s been fighting them for years.

471
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,769
I believe you.

472
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,713
I've been in this business
too long not to smell a set-up.

473
00:55:44,763 --> 00:55:47,346
But we have to be careful
how we handle this

474
00:55:47,396 --> 00:55:50,550
and I cannot risk you
going AWOL on me again.

475
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,313
Now if you get into trouble...

476
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:55,616
you switch this on,

477
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,618
and no matter where you are,

478
00:55:57,668 --> 00:55:59,370
I'll find you.

479
00:56:20,935 --> 00:56:22,437
Hey.

480
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:27,373
You look thirsty.

481
00:56:57,128 --> 00:56:59,981
I’m sorry.
I didn’t know about any of this.

482
00:57:00,051 --> 00:57:01,553
I know.

483
00:57:01,924 --> 00:57:03,105
You do?

484
00:57:03,155 --> 00:57:07,110
The only time you lied to me was
when you told me your size.

485
00:57:09,052 --> 00:57:11,155
How did you know that?

486
00:57:11,885 --> 00:57:14,749
Your heart.
It is special.

487
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:24,931
Maslow is on our side.
He’s going to try to help you.

488
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:27,093
It’s too late.

489
00:57:29,952 --> 00:57:32,039
Ryan, can I talk to you?

490
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:34,913
We have to do this again, Coretti?

491
00:57:35,153 --> 00:57:36,945
I just...

492
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,999
I have reason to believe that a group
of ninja may be on their way here.

493
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:43,132
Well I think these gentlemen can handle
a few whack-jobs wearing pajamas.

494
00:57:43,182 --> 00:57:44,994
- Am I right?
- "Yes"

495
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,857
- See?
- But the situation we discussed---

496
00:57:46,907 --> 00:57:49,109
I’m working on that.
You have to give me some time.

497
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:50,321
We don’t have time.

498
00:57:50,371 --> 00:57:54,045
- They’re not here now, aren't they?
- They’ll be here soon.

499
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,647
How soon?

500
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:00,102
Raizo.

501
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:03,446
- Mika!
- Go with her! Secure the prisoner!

502
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:07,096
Team two, we are on
our way down to the holding cell.

503
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,362
 What's your 20?

504
00:58:08,642 --> 00:58:11,195
We're just now entering Section 4.

505
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,062
- Occupied!
- Occupied!

506
00:58:34,112 --> 00:58:35,334
Good way to get yourself killed, Coretti.

507
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:37,526
I need that cell open.
We're moving the prisoner.

508
00:58:37,576 --> 00:58:40,159
- Those are not my orders.
- Mika, get out of here!

509
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:42,012
Not without you.

510
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:44,885
Then we all die together.

511
00:59:00,694 --> 00:59:02,115
Shit!

512
00:59:18,414 --> 00:59:21,118
- Open that gate!
- I can't do that.

513
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:23,081
Going infrared boys.

514
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:25,779
- They are already in the room.

515
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,386
- Oh, Mika, Mika...
- Shhh

516
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:06,781
I like you more and more.

517
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:08,944
Okay, fuck it!

518
01:00:12,658 --> 01:00:14,160
Shit!

519
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,798
- Mika hurry!
- Okay.

520
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:25,614
Mika, I don't want to sound critical...

521
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,167
Look I'm doing the best I can.

522
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,912
We don't have much time.

523
01:00:40,141 --> 01:00:41,642
Let's go.

524
01:01:06,472 --> 01:01:07,973
Wait here.

525
01:01:43,335 --> 01:01:44,907
Let's go!

526
01:01:52,986 --> 01:01:54,789
Get down! Get down!

527
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:56,601
 I got him!

528
01:02:18,436 --> 01:02:21,100
The car is upstairs.
Go.

529
01:02:22,241 --> 01:02:24,373
- Go now.
- Okay.

530
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,602
Little brother.

531
01:04:52,718 --> 01:04:54,470
Come on Raizo.

532
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:05,133
Raizo, where are you?

533
01:06:12,612 --> 01:06:14,114
Shit!

534
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:27,400
Shit!
Oh my God!

535
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,872
Shit!
Oh my God!

536
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:45,060
No!
No!

537
01:07:57,516 --> 01:07:59,278
xxx
Come on.

538
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,769
Good bye little brother.

539
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:03,263
Get in.

540
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:19,092
I can't believe I found you.

541
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:21,244
I was waiting for you.

542
01:09:30,715 --> 01:09:32,217
Oh God!

543
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:35,531
You have to go to a hospital.

544
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,014
No.
Not a hospital.

545
01:09:39,306 --> 01:09:41,158
Just keep moving.

546
01:09:44,602 --> 01:09:47,235
- Mika, where are you?
- He told me to keep moving.

547
01:09:47,285 --> 01:09:50,188
- Is he still alive?
- After a fashion.

548
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:52,142
Listen, I'm going to bring you in.

549
01:09:52,243 --> 01:09:53,273
No, not this time.

550
01:09:53,552 --> 01:09:55,755
Mika listen to me.
They’re too many people involved now.

551
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:58,698
- It’s just a matter of time.
- Yeah, I don’t think we have much time.

552
01:09:58,748 --> 01:10:00,250
Mika don't ...
Mika?

553
01:10:47,646 --> 01:10:49,899
I know you can’t hear me,

554
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,363
so I’m sure
this doesn’t matter, but ...

555
01:10:54,464 --> 01:10:57,017
I’m going to say it anyway.

556
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,233
I’m just a forensic researcher.

557
01:11:04,246 --> 01:11:08,260
That’s like a fancy way
of saying I’m a librarian.

558
01:11:11,664 --> 01:11:14,718
By myself I can’t
do anything to help you.

559
01:11:18,012 --> 01:11:21,015
I wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

560
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:36,093
And I hope
you can forgive me for this.

561
01:11:37,024 --> 01:11:38,276
- Agent Maslow?
- Yeah?

562
01:11:38,326 --> 01:11:40,408
- The tracking device.
- You've got a lock?

563
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,360
Triangulating her position now.

564
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:47,516
Right. I want the international transport
mobilize and ready to go in five minutes.

565
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:26,072
God damn it.

566
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:32,189
- You!
- No!

567
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:44,624
They took him.
Ten minutes ago.

568
01:12:45,665 --> 01:12:47,167
He’s gone.

569
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,252
xxx

570
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,843
You are Ozunu.

571
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:23,449
You are part of me
as I am part of you.

572
01:13:25,392 --> 01:13:28,035
This is the truth of your lives

573
01:13:30,267 --> 01:13:33,792
and it will remain true after death.

574
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,982
My child.

575
01:14:27,275 --> 01:14:30,258
It is good to see you again.

576
01:14:34,423 --> 01:14:37,977
Do you know
there was a time

577
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,062
when I looked at you

578
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:45,506
I felt a sense of pride.

579
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:50,522
No child has shown more promise.

580
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,139
You are the son I was waiting for.

581
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:59,182
The one to take my place.

582
01:15:02,816 --> 01:15:07,382
And now do you know
what you have done?

583
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:11,997
How you have shamed my family?

584
01:15:12,928 --> 01:15:15,351
How you have hurt me.

585
01:15:19,756 --> 01:15:22,059
Why do you think I did it?

586
01:15:27,365 --> 01:15:31,700
Get this thing out of my sight.

587
01:15:43,024 --> 01:15:47,359
Tonight we avenge
our brothers and sisters.

588
01:15:49,491 --> 01:15:52,986
Tonight we avenge our honor.

589
01:15:55,549 --> 01:16:00,905
Let his death will be remembered
for a thousand years.

590
01:16:12,258 --> 01:16:14,561
Weakness compels strength.

591
01:16:20,468 --> 01:16:23,291
Betrayal begets blood.

592
01:16:31,611 --> 01:16:35,446
You're getting weak,
old man.

593
01:16:54,148 --> 01:16:55,649
Father...

594
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:14,201
Go ahead!

595
01:17:32,162 --> 01:17:33,534
Shit!

596
01:17:37,809 --> 01:17:39,511
What took you?

597
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:40,953
You knew I'd come?

598
01:17:41,003 --> 01:17:44,066
Just because I was asleep
doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.

599
01:17:44,116 --> 01:17:46,609
And I forgive you.

600
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,062
Mika!

601
01:17:54,579 --> 01:17:56,231
Come this way.

602
01:18:15,854 --> 01:18:17,656
You swore to me
you would stay inside the APC.

603
01:18:17,706 --> 01:18:19,278
I thought we were too late.

604
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,250
First team is ready, sir!

605
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,202
- Hit it!
- Go.

606
01:18:31,182 --> 01:18:32,684
Stay here.

607
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:49,163
You two, with me.

608
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:17,046
Come, little brother,
let us play like old times.

609
01:20:05,122 --> 01:20:06,624
My turn.

610
01:21:04,622 --> 01:21:06,925
Do you still think about her?

611
01:21:07,786 --> 01:21:11,040
Do you remember the sound
she made when I stuck her?

612
01:22:16,888 --> 01:22:21,763
You remember all I taught you?

613
01:22:38,243 --> 01:22:41,697
You are true Ozunu.

614
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,672
Come beg your father for forgiveness.

615
01:23:23,686 --> 01:23:25,809
Your heart is weak.

616
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,181
Raizo!

617
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:30,645
All this loss is waste.

618
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:36,502
Because you put yourself
before your family.

619
01:24:38,725 --> 01:24:40,827
This is not my family.

620
01:24:44,281 --> 01:24:46,594
You're not my father.

621
01:24:47,245 --> 01:24:50,148
And the breath I take
after I kill you

622
01:24:50,428 --> 01:24:52,921
will be the first breath of my life.

623
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:19,373
Mika! Run!

624
01:26:19,593 --> 01:26:21,195
Where is he?

625
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:23,057
Where is he!

626
01:26:23,148 --> 01:26:24,649
Get away!

627
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,702
Mika!

628
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:29,165
No!

629
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:37,755
Most children are disappointments,

630
01:26:37,845 --> 01:26:40,348
not worth the effort to raise.

631
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:59,601
Mika!

632
01:28:26,453 --> 01:28:28,705
Jesus Christ what happened?

633
01:28:28,755 --> 01:28:30,658
She saved my life.

634
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:34,853
Medic!

635
01:28:36,294 --> 01:28:37,796
Medic!

636
01:28:43,283 --> 01:28:45,385
She will be all right.

637
01:28:46,516 --> 01:28:48,569
Her heart is special.

638
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:52,834
I need a medic here now!

639
01:28:59,622 --> 01:29:02,976
- She gonna be all right?
- I don’t understand...

640
01:29:03,136 --> 01:29:05,479
She’s got a hole right through
the middle of her heart but...

641
01:29:05,529 --> 01:29:08,142
My heart is over here.

642
01:29:10,605 --> 01:29:12,106
You...

643
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,702
Come with me.

644
