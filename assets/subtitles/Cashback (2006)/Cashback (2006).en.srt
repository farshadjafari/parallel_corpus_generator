7,800 --> 00:01:03,120
It takes approximately 500
pounds to crush a human skull.

2
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,478
But the human emotion
is a much more delicate thing.

3
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:24,158
Take Suzy,
my first real girlfriend.

4
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:26,478
My first real breakup,

5
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:28,676
happening right in front of me.

6
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:32,396
I never thought it was going
to be similar to car crash.

7
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:34,196
I've slammed the brakes,

8
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:38,236
and I'm skidding towards
an emotional impact.

9
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:42,130
So is this all my fault?

10
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:45,837
Me. Ben Willis.

11
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:53,515
It's funny what goes through
your mind at a time like this.

12
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:57,075
The two-and-a-half years
we spent together.

13
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:01,156
The promises we made.

14
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:08,274
The holidays we took
with her parents.

15
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:13,235
The lamp we bought
at Ikea together.

16
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:22,151
It was my final year
at art college.

17
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:23,832
And in the weeks that
followed the breakup,

18
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,552
I tried to figure out
what went wrong.

19
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,954
Why did we break up?

20
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:33,391
It's funny, but when I think back
now the reason seems so small.

21
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,791
One day she's with me,
and she's saying “I love you,”

22
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:40,111
and the next week
she's with someone else.

23
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:42,670
Probably saying
the same thing.

24
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,983
So did she
really love me?

25
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:47,791
What is love anyway?

26
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:50,872
And is it really
that fleeting?

27
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,270
Forget about her.
You don't wanna waste your time

28
00:02:56,312 --> 00:03:00,070
thinking about a girl that dumped you
for a loser like Steve Jenkins.

29
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:03,030
She didn't dump me.

30
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,390
Why did she
chuck you anyway?

31
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,391
It ended

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,509
'cause Suzy thinks the grass is
always greener on the other side.

33
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,469
She's always worrying about there
being a better party to go to.

34
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:19,030
Or a better boyfriend
to be had.

35
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,950
I just felt I could
never make her happy.

36
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,630
And then Steve Jenkins
started texting her.

37
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,748
How did Steve Jenkins
get her number?

38
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,709
It was a good point.

39
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:36,509
I only imagined the worst.

40
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:40,309
I don't want
to think about it.

41
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:42,987
You need to go out with a beautiful girl.
A model or something.

42
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:44,709
Why?

43
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:47,506
Well, because if you've got
a beautiful girl on your arm,

44
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:49,266
then you must
be worth having.

45
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,426
Women are in competition
with each other, you see.

46
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:54,146
Suzy sees you with a sexy baby,
she'll think to herself

47
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,226
“if I can get Ben back
from that beautiful girl,

48
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:59,020
then I must be more
beautiful than her.”

49
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:03,052
Sean's success with women
was pretty impressive.

50
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:09,546
It's true.
Ask your mom.

51
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:15,746
The age-old question.
What is love?

52
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:18,985
Excuse me.

53
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:29,184
That's good. That's perfect.

54
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:04,902
Ben, Mr Adams here
has given his time up for you.

55
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:09,001
Don't you think we should show him
a little bit of respect?

56
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,662
Excuse me.

57
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:29,259
I live in student accommodation
not far from the college.

58
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,938
It's basically
a four-story concrete block

59
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,061
housing some 120
hormone-crazed students.

60
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,778
This is the haunting period.

61
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:49,604
The time when the demons
of regret come for you.

62
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,739
She stood right there

63
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,739
when I said those words:

64
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,098
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,897
I don't think
I can make you happy.

66
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,210
Maybe we should break up.

67
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:07,164
And that's when
she got angry.

68
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,017
Hello?

69
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,817
Suzy, it's me, Ben.

70
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,735
Ben! I was asleep.
What is it?

71
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:44,576
Suzy, um

72
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:48,696
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:50,895
I'm sorry too.

74
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:58,974
Do you think there's any chance
we'll get back together?

75
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,974
I don't think so, Ben.

76
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,735
I think it ran its course.

77
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,382
Besides,
I'm with Steve now.

78
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,973
Have you
slept with him?

79
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,774
Yes.

80
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:23,091
Was it good?
I mean, is it better than—

81
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:26,411
I don't wanna talk
about it with you, Ben.

82
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:29,812
I've gotta go.
Sorry, Ben.

83
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:32,373
Suzy?

84
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:23,243
To think about her now
with someone else,

85
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:27,758
it felt like all the oxygen
had been sucked from the room.

86
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,400
After my breakup with Suzy,
I just couldn't fall asleep anymore.

87
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:36,559
The more I tried to sleep,
the less tired I felt.

88
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,240
I was wide awake.

89
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,920
I tried everything.

90
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,439
I'd just become
immune to sleep.

91
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,623
I suddenly found
I had eight extra hours.

92
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,318
My life had been
extended by a third.

93
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,037
I wanted time to pass quickly,
but instead I was forced to witness

94
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,451
the passing of every
second of every hour.

95
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,955
I wanted the hurt I felt
to go away,

96
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,556
but in some cruel trick
of events,

97
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:11,195
I now had even more time
on my hands.

98
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,758
More time
to think about Suzy.

99
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:18,484
Would you mind getting out?
Just checking that wheel?

100
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:36,316
I took the bus
with no real place to go.

101
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:41,435
I watched the landscape slowly change
as it clung to the last hours of sunlight,

102
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:45,329
before leaving me to get
another sleepless night.

103
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:01,552
I started to read all the books
I wished I'd had time to read.

104
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:06,548
With the extra hours, I even had time
to reread my favorite ones.

105
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,962
But she was never far
from my mind.

106
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,547
Two pounds 75, please.

107
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:55,187
Ah, how much is it
without these two?

108
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:03,706
One pound 70.

109
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:16,293
It was getting obvious that I
needed to trade some of my time.

110
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:23,984
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,304
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,984
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:33,904
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
It all looks fantastic, man.

114
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:37,850
I think you'll fit in
very well here.

115
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,542
It's a great
feeling inside, Ben.

116
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:47,381
It's marvelous. We hope
you've enjoyed reading about

117
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,781
what it's like to be part
of Sainsbury's and listening.

118
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,581
I know, I've been
through this with you.

119
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:56,221
There's so many opportunities,
Ben. It's a life thing.

120
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:06,148
I could feel a faint shift
in a faraway place.

121
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:11,701
A current of unknown
consequences was on its way

122
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,261
moving towards me like
an unstoppable wave of fate.

123
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,101
T-E-A-M-W-O-R-K. Work.

124
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,221
Teamwork, Ben.

125
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,259
Welcome aboard.

126
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:50,672
And so I started working
the night shift at Sainsbury's.

127
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:54,336
During the hours most
normal people are sleeping,

128
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,897
I'm busy trading my time.

129
00:15:56,937 --> 00:16:02,097
I give them my extra eight hours,
and they give me money. Cash back.

130
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,697
Hi.
Oh, hi.

131
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:16,057
I'm late again. Jenkins is gonna
kill me. See you later.

132
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:17,736
Yeah, see ya.

133
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:21,016
hey,haron!
Yes, Mr Jenkins?

134
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,215
Late again, Sharon.
I'm sorry, Mr Jenkins.

135
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,694
Second time this week.I know, Mr Jenkins.

136
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,455
I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

137
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:29,255
Okay.

138
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:43,654
My first year at art college
was boring to say the least.

139
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:46,693
But it helped me to appreciate
the fundamentals of still life.

140
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:49,572
I'd like to remind the customers
that there's a special

141
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:53,052
two for the price of one
offer on aisle ten.

142
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:59,424
Fresh bread and cakes. That's aisle ten
for a special two for the price of one offer.

143
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,894
Well, don't just
stare at it, Ben!

144
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:06,733
Clean it up.

145
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:17,250
You see, I've always
wanted to be a painter.

146
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,571
And like many artists
before me,

147
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:24,360
the female form has always been
a great source of inspiration.

148
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:33,639
I've always been in awe of the power
they unknowingly possess.

149
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,170
Now, are you going
to clean them up or not?

150
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:50,609
There is an art to dealing with
the boredom of an eight-hour shift.

151
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:55,608
An art to putting your mind somewhere else
while the seconds slowly tick away.

152
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,168
I found that all
the people working here

153
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,928
had perfected
their own individual art.

154
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,010
Take Sharon Pintey.

155
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,646
Sharon knows rule number one.
The clock is the enemy.

156
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,688
The basic rule is this:

157
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:12,133
the more you look at the clock,
the slower the time goes.

158
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,886
It will uncover
the hiding place of your mind

159
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:22,687
and torture it
with every second.

160
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:32,686
This is the basic art in dealing
with the trade of your time.

161
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,767
Any cash back?

162
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:59,165
This is Barry Brickman.

163
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:04,269
You see, Barry thinks of himself
as a bit of a daredevil stuntman.

164
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,884
For a start,
Barry is quite well-known.

165
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:10,243
When one of Barry's
bike tricks went wrong,

166
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:13,313
the cameraman put it
on the internet.

167
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,496
Barry has stuck
to his scooter ever since.

168
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:22,048
Matt Stephens is also
a king scooterer.

169
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:29,083
And what was
the other thing?

170
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:36,842
And what was
the other thing?

171
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:40,603
Sausage!
Oh, yeah.

172
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:46,241
Now Barry and Matt
are good friends.

173
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:48,282
There you go.
Take care.

174
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:51,039
Between them, they have come
up with a very different way

175
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:53,880
of dealing with
the trade of their time.

176
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:55,602
Look. Look.

177
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:01,822
Theirs is an art to finding anything
to do that isn't work.

178
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,719
A few days later,
Barry and Matt were reported

179
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,359
for what they called
Helping the ladies.

180
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,278
It was these shampoo bottles
that sent them on their quest.

181
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,358
Barry and Matt knew
what they looked like.

182
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,358
And they knew that the women in
the supermarket knew what they looked like.

183
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,158
Their theory was that even
though it was a sex toy

184
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,837
masquerading as
a bottle of shampoo,

185
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:33,997
women would like
to try it as a sex toy

186
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,477
but were embarrassed to buy it
because they knew what it looked like.

187
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:42,597
The decision to buy it would be an easier one
if they were already at the checkout.

188
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:45,037
If they didn't object,
then Barry and Matt knew

189
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,717
they'd helped a bottle
find a happy home.

190
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:54,916
Barry had challenged Matt
to a scooter race

191
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,436
in which they would sprint
down one aisle and up the next.

192
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:00,395
They would do all 14 aisles, and
then back to the starting line.

193
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:03,834
They had been waiting for the day
the manager called in sick.

194
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:08,915
The art of doing something else other than
the work you're supposed to do, is addictive.

195
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:10,995
The excitement of doing something
that you shouldn't be doing,

196
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,235
along with the consequences
if you're caught doing it,

197
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:16,434
are so strong that it often pulls
others away from their own art.

198
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,475
On your marks,
get set, go!

199
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,474
We got winded!

200
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:43,355
I hadn't slept in two weeks.

201
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,592
My breakup with Suzy had left me with
a sense that time had become unhinged.

202
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:55,432
I drifted between
imagination and reality,

203
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:59,120
between past and present
with increasing ease.

204
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:03,232
I feel like a real man.
You like men.

205
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:04,751
You like real men,
don't you?

206
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,873
When I'm out there
in the kit,

207
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:09,912
on the pitch
with the boys,

208
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:13,472
I look like a god,
I'm an Adonis.

209
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:30,030
I keep myself
in good shape.

210
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,550
I see the looks.
I ignore them.

211
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:38,149
I feel the bolts of time slowly
coming away from the breakup.

212
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,909
Time manipulation
is not a precise science.

213
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,988
Like any art,
it's personal to the individual.

214
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,883
So what is the art in making
my shift go so fast?

215
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:54,350
I imagine the opposite.

216
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,268
That time is frozen.

217
00:22:57,348 --> 00:23:01,669
I imagine the remote control
for life has been paused.

218
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:38,951
Within this frozen world, I'm able
to walk freely and unnoticed.

219
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:44,924
Nobody would even know
that time had stopped.

220
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,064
And when it started
back up again,

221
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:57,823
the invisible join would be seamless
except for a slight shudder.

222
00:23:57,865 --> 00:24:02,406
Not unlike the feeling of somebody
walking over your grave.

223
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:16,901
That moment when you see someone
walking down the street

224
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:20,865
who is so beautiful
you just can't help but stare…

225
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:25,461
Well, imagine as I do,
that with the world on pause

226
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:29,661
it becomes very easy to understand
the concept of beauty.

227
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:32,020
To have it frozen
in front of you.

228
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:33,263
Captured.

229
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:37,062
Unaware.

230
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:51,820
For me, this fascination with beauty
started at a very young age.

231
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:56,179
I was six or seven, and my mom and
dad had taken on a foreign student.

232
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,779
She was in her late teens,

233
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:00,579
and was studying English
at a nearby school.

234
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:06,813
Being Swedish, the walk from the shower
to her room didn't need to be a modest one.

235
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:11,819
It was at that moment that something
very profound happened to me.

236
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,778
I was exposed to the female form
in a way I had never experienced.

237
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,298
I felt fascination and wonder
at the beauty of her nakedness.

238
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,217
And I wanted to freeze the world
so that I could live in that moment for a week.

239
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,379
I have never had a feeling
of such completeness.

240
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:36,651
To this day I still think it was one
of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.

241
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:52,737
You dropped these.

242
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:15,056
And would it be wrong?

243
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:17,814
Would they hate me
for seeing them?

244
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:20,195
I mean, really seeing them?

245
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:31,413
I read once about a woman whose secret fantasy
was to have an affair with an artist.

246
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:34,613
She thought that he
would really see her.

247
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:36,934
He would see every curve,

248
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:40,614
every line,
every indentation,

249
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:46,089
and love them because they were part
of the beauty that made her unique.

250
00:28:57,644 --> 00:29:00,682
And when I'm ready, all I have
to do to start time again

251
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:03,203
is crack my fingers.

252
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:14,444
You look like shit.

253
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:15,924
Cheers.

254
00:29:23,082 --> 00:29:25,403
Still not sleeping?
No.

255
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,640
Feeling any better about Suzy?
No.

256
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,240
Wanna talk about it?
No.

257
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:30,761
No? Why?

258
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:32,639
Because every morning
you come by,

259
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:35,319
and every morning I talk
about the same thing.

260
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:38,919
And I'm bored of saying the same thing,
and I'm bored of feeling shit about it.

261
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,800
And most of all I'm bored of
being awake 24 hours a day.

262
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:45,078
Eew! Look who didn't get out of bed
on the wrong side this morning.

263
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,681
Very funny.

264
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:50,638
But seriously, you're gonna feel like shit.
It's gonna take time.

265
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,520
For instance, how long ago
did you think about her

266
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,318
before we started having
this conversation?

267
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,679
About ten minutes before
you knocked on the door.

268
00:29:57,721 --> 00:30:00,639
Oh, yeah.
And what was the thought?

269
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,480
I thought about the dust.

270
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,439
The dust?
God, you're weird!

271
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,717
Anyway, whatever. My point is,
every day you think about her

272
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:19,437
and the things that you associate
with her less and less.

273
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,796
Before long, you'll go a whole day
without thinking about her.

274
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:23,797
You know what might help
speed up the process?

275
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,079
What?

276
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:35,836
Me and Sean had been friends
since we were five.

277
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:39,236
We lived across the street from
one another, and grew up together.

278
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:41,475
For his 12th birthday,
Sean's mom and dad

279
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:43,955
had bought him
a state-of the-art computer.

280
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:46,955
Oh, mom!

281
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:50,355
Come on, boys, it's a nice day.
Why don't you play in the park?

282
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:53,716
No. We're okay
playing this.

283
00:30:56,997 --> 00:31:00,781
Okay, I'm off shopping.
You be all right by yourselves?

284
00:31:00,836 --> 00:31:03,435
Yes, mom. Bye, mom.

285
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,555
Bye, Mrs Higgins.

286
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,995
I won't be long.

287
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:18,834
Wanna see something?
What?

288
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:29,993
What are they?
Girls with no clothes on.

289
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:34,477
Sean had found the magazines
under his mom and dad's bed.

290
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:38,193
The Swedish student was one thing,
but this was something completely different.

291
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:41,591
The smiles on the girls' faces
and the total lack of shyness

292
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,150
about what they were showing the camera
was so confusing for me.

293
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:49,951
I had never seen the female part
up close and in so much detail.

294
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,750
I guess I imagined
something neater,

295
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:56,110
like a smooth hole
drilled into a piece of wood.

296
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:58,790
The sort of hole where
you might place a wooden peg.

297
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:02,429
But the reality was much more
sexually aggressive.

298
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:04,990
It was hard to imagine
that my teacher, Mrs Booth,

299
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:08,630
had one under her skirt
that looked just like it.

300
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:10,632
Mom!

301
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,870
Forgot my purse.

302
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,470
Hey, what have
you two been up to?

303
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,632
After that, Sean's mom
always thought we were gay.

304
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,429
What will help speed up
the process?

305
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:37,323
You need to distract yourself
with a couple of Natalies.

306
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:43,546
A Natalie was a term that Sean
had coined for any sexual encounter

307
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:48,267
that happened with a girl you
weren't in a relationship with.

308
00:32:55,708 --> 00:33:00,265
The term had come from a girl called Natalie
who lived across the street from Sean.

309
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:05,267
Hello. Is Natalie in?
Yeah. Natalie!

310
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:07,308
Yeah?
It's for you.

311
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:09,385
You see, Sean had
worked out the connection

312
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:12,465
between the smiling faces
of the girls in the magazines

313
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:15,426
and the fact that
they were naked.

314
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:38,824
Fifty p.

315
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:00,784
That's it.

316
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:09,485
Natalie became one of the most
popular girls on the street.

317
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:22,901
Croissants on special offer.

318
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:36,700
She had
massive tits.

319
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,061
Very funny.

320
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,141
We were only
having a laugh.

321
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,780
Who's that?

322
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:50,021
That's a new kid.

323
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:53,299
Apparently he's
a martial arts expert.

324
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,819
Hey, mate!

325
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:59,259
Come here.

326
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,018
What's your name?

327
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:09,178
Brian.

328
00:35:09,258 --> 00:35:11,619
Ben says you know
kung fu.

329
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:14,018
Yeah.

330
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,618
Do you reckon you can have me?
Yeah.

331
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:20,179
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

332
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,137
Show us your moves then.

333
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:39,496
Grab my arm.

334
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:49,376
That's not funny.

335
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,775
Hi.

336
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,336
Hi, Ben.

337
00:35:58,215 --> 00:36:00,375
You're not
working tonight?

338
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:03,176
No, I swapped
two hours this week.

339
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:07,175
Is that a pickle sandwich?

340
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:10,174
Oh, ah, yeah.

341
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:12,855
Could I have a bite?
I'm starving.

342
00:36:17,415 --> 00:36:20,414
Mmm. Thanks.

343
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:26,133
What?
You got some there.

344
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:28,213
Hum.
Not here.

345
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,453
Let me.

346
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:42,252
Thanks.

347
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:52,012
I wanted to freeze time.

348
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:01,397
I wanted to savor
that moment.

349
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,471
To live in that moment
for a week.

350
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:09,770
But I couldn't stop it.

351
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,491
Only slow it.

352
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,610
And before I knew it,
she was gone.

353
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:25,059
After the door closed, I felt like
the last person on earth.

354
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:44,209
What are you doing?

355
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,366
Jenkins wanted us to go and fill the shelves.
So here we are.

356
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:50,248
Iiiieeee.

357
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:54,938
Take no notice of him. He's love struck.
He asked Sharon out today.

358
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:57,887
You did?
What did she say?

359
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:00,488
She said yes.He's taking her

360
00:38:00,568 --> 00:38:02,284
to the pictures
tomorrow night.

361
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:07,927
Then it's back to mine. I'll need about
half an hour to talk away me face.

362
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:11,807
And then, she's gonna
get some of this.

363
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:17,605
Crush.

364
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:20,004
It's funny how the same word
for the feeling of attraction

365
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,404
can be used for the feeling
of disappointment.

366
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:26,364
The Oxford English dictionary states
one of the meanings for the word crushed

367
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:30,809
as strong and unreasoning,
but transitory attachment.

368
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,243
I had three crushes
when I was young.

369
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:38,523
The first was an athlete
called Zola Budd.

370
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:41,963
She was 18, and looked like a tomboy
with a small, slender frame.

371
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:45,322
But it was the fact that Zola Budd
defiantly ran barefoot

372
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,010
that made her so completely
attractive for me.

373
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:53,962
It was the Los Angeles olympics
that would go down in history.

374
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:59,362
In the 3,000 meter race, Zola Budd
clashed with the American, Mary Decker.

375
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:03,532
Budd's heart for the race
was left where Decker fell.

376
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:06,523
Zola finished seventh.

377
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:09,761
Ben, it's time for bed now.
You've got school tomorrow.

378
00:39:09,803 --> 00:39:12,163
Well, well.
What an upset.

379
00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:16,520
Can somebody tell me something
about the white blood cells? Tim?

380
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:20,642
Uh, they help fight off bacteria
and germs in the body.

381
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:22,401
Very well done.

382
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:23,961
Types.

383
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:28,241
of cells.

384
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,601
The second crush was for
my biology teacher, Mrs Booth.

385
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,521
Okay, class, who can tell me
something about cells?

386
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:39,479
She was a confident woman
whose figure-hugging outfits

387
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:42,040
hinted at the sexiness
that lay hidden beneath.

388
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:45,998
I imagined Mrs Booth asking me
to stay behind after school

389
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,758
and showing me the same
thing under her skirt

390
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:52,318
as the girls I'd seen
in the magazines with Sean.

391
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,970
But the main crush I had was
with a girl called Tanya Green.

392
00:39:58,078 --> 00:40:02,157
When I looked at Tanya,
I didn't just see her, I felt her.

393
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,052
The white blood cells and
red blood cells work together.

394
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,797
Oy!

395
00:40:25,277 --> 00:40:29,887
The next day, Tanya caused a
lot of excitement in the class.

396
00:40:36,196 --> 00:40:38,235
Tanya had broken her arm
falling from a swing,

397
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:40,794
and her cast had caused much excitement
amongst the other kids at the school.

398
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:43,835
Settle down now,
please, class.

399
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:46,075
That's enough.

400
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:48,357
But I saw it differently.

401
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:51,285
It was the way Tanya dealt with it.

402
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:55,342
The way she
scratched an itch.

403
00:40:57,234 --> 00:41:00,193
The way it restricted
her movements.

404
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:07,257
The increasing amount of graffiti that
appeared on it during its six-week life span.

405
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:10,594
Would you like
to sign it?

406
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,594
Just here.

407
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:22,795
Thanks.

408
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:30,392
Go away!
Stop it!

409
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:36,790
On the day the cast
finally came off,

410
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:38,471
Tanya's arm
was covered in hair.

411
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,271
Go on back to the jungle.

412
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:46,870
The six weeks without light had caused
the hair to grow thick and black.

413
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:49,910
But while the other kids joked
and called her monkey,

414
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:53,323
it only heightened
my fascination for her.

415
00:41:57,911 --> 00:41:59,270
Don't cry.

416
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,351
You don't have to
worry about them.

417
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,212
I think you're beautiful
the way you are.

418
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,629
Will you be
my girlfriend?

419
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,030
Yes.

420
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,468
There was a place that
I often went to by myself.

421
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:24,747
It was just
behind the school.

422
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:28,827
It was close enough to still hear the screams
and shouts of the kids playing their games.

423
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:32,928
But at the same time,
it felt hidden away from them.

424
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:37,758
I had arranged
to meet Tanya there.

425
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:45,148
Whatcha?

426
00:42:45,227 --> 00:42:47,108
Whatcha?

427
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:02,387
You wanna kiss me?

428
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,345
So this was to be
my first kiss.

429
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:08,386
Yeah.

430
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:14,385
Hey! Where you going?

431
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:18,425
I gotta go.
I'll kiss you tomorrow.

432
00:43:18,506 --> 00:43:22,864
But tomorrow's Saturday.
Meet me here at 11:00.

433
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:32,823
I often came to play around the
school grounds on a saturday.

434
00:43:32,864 --> 00:43:37,062
The familiar building,
so unfamiliar in its quietness.

435
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:40,200
Peaceful, as if time
had frozen still.

436
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:57,342
It's like the walls
of this room.

437
00:43:57,382 --> 00:43:59,660
It keeps the whole
building standing.

438
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:04,381
Tanya's parents had taken her on a
surprise holiday to America.

439
00:44:04,423 --> 00:44:07,179
They set up home there,
and never returned.

440
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:12,037
It was the first time my heart felt
the other meaning of crush.

441
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,421
Checkmate.

442
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:26,179
What's wrong with you?
You normally kick my arse at chess.

443
00:44:26,221 --> 00:44:28,740
Have you met someone?

444
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,980
Well, come on.
Give me the juice.

445
00:44:33,021 --> 00:44:36,777
No, it's nothing really.
Just a girl at work I think is nice.

446
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:40,179
Nice? Nice what?
Nice rack?

447
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,500
No.

448
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,337
Well, yeah,
but nothing like that.

449
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:48,180
What?
Girlfriend material?

450
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,578
She got small hands?

451
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:53,697
What's that got to do with anything?
Makes your willy look big.

452
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:55,938
You're such a loser.

453
00:44:55,978 --> 00:44:57,657
So have you asked her out?

454
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:01,057
No. Someone already beat me to it.
Ohh, she got a boyfriend.

455
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,896
No, but one of the guys at work
asked her out. She said yes.

456
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:06,135
They're going
to the pictures tonight.

457
00:45:06,177 --> 00:45:08,336
That doesn't mean
she fancies him.

458
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:12,850
She might just like him, and want
someone to go to pictures with.

459
00:45:14,618 --> 00:45:18,953
How many girls have you taken
to the pictures and then snogged?

460
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:22,456
Oh, yeah!

461
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:33,175
What?

462
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,456
Quite a few.

463
00:45:36,536 --> 00:45:38,695
There you go.

464
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:45,256
Can I have that?

465
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:52,495
Yeah, yeah,
that's right, Rory.

466
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:57,014
Well, of course I played professionally,
before the injury.

467
00:45:57,095 --> 00:45:58,574
Any day, Rory.

468
00:45:58,654 --> 00:46:02,934
You name the date,
me and my boys'll be there.

469
00:46:02,974 --> 00:46:06,173
All right. Sunday.

470
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:10,574
Just don't go crying
to your mama.

471
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:15,894
Ciao.
Whatever.

472
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:17,532
Tosser.

473
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:25,252
Game on.

474
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:27,733
2,000 feet jump.

475
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:30,971
Can't beat it.
3,000, kill ya.

476
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,930
There he is!

477
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,009
So, how'd it go
with Sharon?

478
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:57,371
Oh, mate!
So, did ya?

479
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,089
Of course I did.
She loved it.

480
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:05,328
Couldn't get enough of it. She went like
the toilet door on a bombay shrimp trawler.

481
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,489
Rack?
Well, put it this way.

482
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:10,008
At least you know your kids
will never go hungry.

483
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,330
And?

484
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,529
Like an artist's pocket.

485
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,968
Okay, champs.
Rory Brown.

486
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:23,127
Manager of
Sainsbury's, Islington,

487
00:47:23,169 --> 00:47:26,884
has challenged us to a football match
on Sunday night.

488
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:30,727
Finished?

489
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:32,447
Good.

490
00:47:32,528 --> 00:47:35,526
The reputation of
this supermarket is at stake.

491
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:39,847
Your reputations, as employees, are at stake.

492
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:43,366
This is not just
a game of football.

493
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:46,917
This is what it means to
be a modern-day gladiator!

494
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:52,086
Now, I want you to think of me
as Russell Crowe.

495
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:55,526
And you, you're all
the other slaves.

496
00:47:55,566 --> 00:48:00,006
And as slaves,
you will play to the death!

497
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:04,766
For what happens on Sunday night,
will echo through eternity.

498
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:14,164
Sunday. 8:00 pm.
Sunny sports center.

499
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:30,444
You have got to got
to be joking, right?

500
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:35,083
We're gonna get murdered.

501
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:40,564
Aaah!

502
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,683
Hi.
All right.

503
00:48:48,682 --> 00:48:50,683
Ah, bollocks!

504
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:54,281
Playing on this right wing. Like a train, I am.
Hiya.

505
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:55,602
Heads up!

506
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:02,920
Gather round, Whitechapel.
Whitechapel, gather round.

507
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:06,322
Okay, chaps, this is it!

508
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:09,441
That is Islington Sainsbury's
over there.

509
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:14,281
All I can see are
a lot of pretty uniforms.

510
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:16,641
Take a good look
at one another.

511
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,361
Why?

512
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:22,481
Natural-born killers!
Every one of you!

513
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,960
So let's get stuck in there
and settle this! Huh? Huh?

514
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,920
Huh?

515
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,997
Hey, Barry, I've got
this really great game.

516
00:49:43,038 --> 00:49:44,478
All right, Rory.

517
00:49:44,558 --> 00:49:46,199
Jenkins.

518
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:49,399
There's some pretty
uniforms you boys got.

519
00:49:49,478 --> 00:49:53,119
See you've brought
your top team this time.

520
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:59,198
Looks can be deceiving.

521
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:03,357
Well, that's obvious.
What?

522
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:06,798
Right. Call.

523
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,157
Heads.
No, tails.

524
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:12,757
Tails it is.

525
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:15,836
Come along!

526
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,476
We've got one goal.

527
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:27,956
All right.
Get in your spaces.

528
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:34,155
Ohh!
Look at that!

529
00:50:41,835 --> 00:50:43,435
Get it!

530
00:50:45,194 --> 00:50:47,715
Come on, take it, come on!

531
00:50:53,314 --> 00:50:55,273
Come on, after it.

532
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:10,312
I'm playing! I'm playing! The safe keys
are hanging off, on the top shelf!

533
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:13,313
Get it! Get it!

534
00:51:17,872 --> 00:51:20,473
What?

535
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:25,951
Triangles!
Triangles!

536
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:30,951
Foul!
No foul! Play on!

537
00:51:30,992 --> 00:51:33,391
Play on, my arse!

538
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:35,232
I'm all right!

539
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:38,710
I'm all right!
I'm all right!

540
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,431
What are you doing?

541
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:44,790
Grow up.
Forget about the money.

542
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,071
What money?
What are you doing?

543
00:51:47,111 --> 00:51:50,669
What am I doing? I'm talking to
an empty phone is what I'm doing,

544
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,708
'cause there's a dead man on
the other end of this fucking line!

545
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,549
I love that film!
Pacino. Didn't you hear though?

546
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:01,964
You oughta see the bank job
shootout scene on me plasma screen!

547
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,228
Come on, Whitechapel,
We can still win this.

548
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:09,548
Come on, lads!
Shoot!

549
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:12,628
Aye! Dipstick!

550
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:13,629
Sorry!

551
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,192
The ball, the ball,
the ball, the ball!

552
00:52:22,947 --> 00:52:25,108
For the love of God!

553
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,867
Yeah! Finally!

554
00:52:34,428 --> 00:52:37,666
Oh, my Lord!
Get a life, dipstick!

555
00:52:40,746 --> 00:52:42,826
Time out, ref.
Time out.

556
00:52:46,387 --> 00:52:49,267
Well, chaps,
could be worse.

557
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:52,864
How could it be worse?
It's 26-nil.

558
00:52:52,905 --> 00:52:54,906
It doesn't matter.

559
00:52:54,946 --> 00:52:59,586
What matters is, there's less
than a minute to play.

560
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:03,518
And we are not leaving this pitch
until we score a goal!

561
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:09,585
Matt, get the ball to Ben.

562
00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:14,905
Ben, this is your moment.

563
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:18,704
I need you.

564
00:53:18,744 --> 00:53:20,743
Get your little legs.

565
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:25,024
Run up that right flank
like the devil were after you.

566
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:29,663
I'll be in the center
waiting for your cross.

567
00:53:29,743 --> 00:53:31,944
Use Barry if you need to.

568
00:53:32,023 --> 00:53:34,422
Matt, stay on my left flank.

569
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:38,543
I need that cross.

570
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,782
I need that ball,

571
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,103
here.

572
00:53:44,663 --> 00:53:46,503
I'll take the shot.

573
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:51,461
And we, we will
share the glory.

574
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:54,422
Got it?
Yeah.

575
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:56,581
Now let's score a goal!

576
00:53:56,661 --> 00:54:00,342
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

577
00:54:00,422 --> 00:54:03,620
Come on, boys, come on!

578
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:08,137
No!

579
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:25,934
I often wonder
what it would be like

580
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:28,654
to spend the rest of my life
with the world on pause.

581
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:32,492
To live out the rest of my life
between two fractions of a second.

582
00:55:32,534 --> 00:55:35,294
To die of old age,
and then have time continue.

583
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:39,894
The young me gone,
and a dead old man in my place.

584
00:56:04,053 --> 00:56:07,975
Was I spending too much time
in this frozen world?

585
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:12,132
It felt safe, untouchable.

586
00:56:12,173 --> 00:56:15,892
But how safe
is anyone's world?

587
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:58,649
Hello?

588
00:57:02,408 --> 00:57:04,489
Anyone there?

589
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:52,364
It's funny, but the
last thing I imagined

590
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:56,809
was that maybe I wasn't the
only one who could stop time.

591
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:09,525
Oh, my God!

592
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,924
You all right?

593
00:58:17,003 --> 00:58:20,375
Don't just stand there!
Drive me to the hospital!

594
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:24,202
You make sure Sharon gets home all right?
Yeah.

595
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:25,323
Cheers, mate.

596
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:32,082
Right, I'll see
you both tomorrow.

597
00:58:32,122 --> 00:58:34,283
See ya.
Bye.

598
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:43,762
Thanks.
Thank you.

599
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,840
I felt that game was
never going to end.

600
00:58:47,882 --> 00:58:51,120
Matt's face when the ball hit Jenkins.
Oh, I know.

601
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:53,019
Do you think
he'll be okay?

602
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:56,040
It was ego more than
anything, I'd say.

603
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,120
It's probably none
of my business, but,

604
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:06,279
are you and Matt
seeing each other?

605
00:59:06,321 --> 00:59:10,398
No. We went to the cinema
the other night, but just as friends.

606
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,640
Hmm.

607
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,279
Why? What
has Matt said?

608
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,280
He said he slept with you.

609
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:25,048
So you didn't?
No, of course not! What do you take me for?

610
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:27,518
Sorry.

611
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:30,119
Did he say
if I was any good?

612
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:33,718
I think it was the best sex
he's never had.

613
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,518
So you don't have a boyfriend?

614
00:59:38,597 --> 00:59:41,117
No. We split
about six months ago.

615
00:59:41,197 --> 00:59:43,276
He went off to university
in the States and

616
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:46,001
it became impossible
to see each other.

617
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:50,358
And you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

618
00:59:50,438 --> 00:59:52,677
We broke up
a few weeks ago.

619
00:59:52,716 --> 00:59:55,757
I'm sorry.
How are you doing?

620
00:59:56,756 --> 00:59:58,957
Better.

621
01:00:02,476 --> 01:00:05,677
So how long have you been
at the supermarket?

622
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:07,515
'bout two years.

623
01:00:07,595 --> 01:00:11,594
Did you get to college?
I was doing p.t. therapy, but I dropped out.

624
01:00:11,636 --> 01:00:13,395
Why?

625
01:00:13,475 --> 01:00:17,233
It wasn't me. And besides,
I needed to start earning money.

626
01:00:17,275 --> 01:00:19,555
What are you saving for?

627
01:00:19,635 --> 01:00:21,675
Putting myself
through evening classes.

628
01:00:21,716 --> 01:00:23,754
Yeah? Studying.

629
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:25,194
Spanish.

630
01:00:25,274 --> 01:00:26,755
Spanish?

631
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:28,830
Yeah. What's wrong
with that?

632
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:33,835
N-n-nothing. I just wasn't expecting it.
So what can you say?

633
01:00:37,074 --> 01:00:39,313
Mmm.

634
01:00:39,393 --> 01:00:42,914
Tu equipo de futbol
es una puta mierda.

635
01:00:44,113 --> 01:00:45,593
Which means?

636
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:49,113
It means your
football team is shit.

637
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:52,033
26-nil.

638
01:00:55,992 --> 01:00:57,473
So why Spanish?

639
01:00:59,513 --> 01:01:01,792
I've lived here all my life.

640
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:05,711
I've worked at the supermarket
for two years and,

641
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:08,552
even though
it's happening slow,

642
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:13,512
I just feel that my life's ticking away
a second at a time.

643
01:01:13,591 --> 01:01:18,230
I thought that Spanish would be
one way that I'd be able to find a job
that would involve travel.

644
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:23,363
Like being an air hostess or teaching
English at Spanish-speaking schools.

645
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:28,751
I've always dreamt of traveling
to far-off places… like South America.

646
01:01:28,831 --> 01:01:31,927
To places where the sun
kisses every morning.

647
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,988
But more than that,
I wanna be able

648
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,828
to talk to people about their lives
and about their dreams.

649
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,749
Silly, really.

650
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,550
No, it's not.

651
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,309
That's your dream.

652
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,789
Knowing what you want
is half the battle.

653
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,826
Most people go through their whole lives
not knowing what they want.

654
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:53,507
It's easy to find if you know
what you're looking for.

655
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:55,586
So what is it that
you're looking for?

656
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,148
I've always wanted
to be a painter.

657
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:01,324
Maybe have my work hung
in a gallery one day.

658
01:02:01,348 --> 01:02:04,507
I've always wanted
to meet a painter.

659
01:02:05,748 --> 01:02:07,547
Why?

660
01:02:08,707 --> 01:02:10,707
Don't know.

661
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:16,026
I think it might be something to do
with their ability to see beauty in everything.

662
01:02:16,068 --> 01:02:19,990
To then capture it, and hang it
on a wall for all to see.

663
01:02:22,507 --> 01:02:24,586
I find it romantic.

664
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:39,186
Well, this is me.

665
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:41,506
Number 34.

666
01:02:41,545 --> 01:02:43,306
Thirty-four.

667
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,266
It's on the top floor.

668
01:02:45,306 --> 01:02:46,506
Nice.

669
01:02:49,825 --> 01:02:50,864
Adios.

670
01:02:52,104 --> 01:02:53,704
Hasta luego.

671
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,223
Night, Ben.

672
01:03:12,303 --> 01:03:14,663
That first kiss.

673
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:18,262
I've always made
such a mess of it.

674
01:03:19,982 --> 01:03:21,103
Come!

675
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:28,220
Hiya. I just wanted to know
whether you were all right.

676
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:30,502
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm fine.

677
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:33,180
'Cause it looked
really painful last night.

678
01:03:33,222 --> 01:03:36,942
Oh, no.
I've worse than this.

679
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:40,102
And the hospital said
you'd be okay?

680
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:42,741
Ah, you know.
They said I'd live.

681
01:03:42,822 --> 01:03:45,461
Are you sure
you're all right?

682
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:47,821
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

683
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,340
Do you know?
I've almost forgot it happened.

684
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:54,781
I really can't feel a thing!

685
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:57,659
I'm thinking of having
a party on Saturday.

686
01:03:57,701 --> 01:04:01,500
You know,
cheer everybody up.

687
01:04:01,539 --> 01:04:05,059
Sure you'll all be there.
Won't you, Sharon?

688
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:08,620
Um, yeah.

689
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:11,219
Great.

690
01:04:20,098 --> 01:04:22,298
Hiya.
Whatcha?

691
01:04:22,339 --> 01:04:24,953
Thanks for walking me
home last night.

692
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:29,499
That's all right. Thanks for sharing
your dream with me.

693
01:04:29,538 --> 01:04:32,057
So have you heard
the party rumor?

694
01:04:32,097 --> 01:04:33,897
No.

695
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:36,657
Jenkins' birthday on Saturday.
He's throwing a party.

696
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:38,535
We've all got to
be there apparently.

697
01:04:38,577 --> 01:04:39,777
Oh.

698
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,497
Will you be my date?

699
01:04:43,577 --> 01:04:45,537
Sharon?

700
01:04:48,336 --> 01:04:51,417
It's my lunch break.
Can you relieve me?

701
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:04,415
So, will you
be my date?

702
01:05:04,495 --> 01:05:06,176
Yeah.

703
01:05:07,256 --> 01:05:08,576
Great.

704
01:05:10,095 --> 01:05:13,056
Shelf stacker to
aisle ten, please.

705
01:05:13,136 --> 01:05:16,053
Can we have a shelf stacker
to aisle ten?

706
01:05:16,095 --> 01:05:20,636
Steven, if you're in the shop,
can you report to aisle ten?

707
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:25,454
It's your lunch break.
No, it's not.

708
01:05:25,494 --> 01:05:28,865
It is. It's your lunch break.
I don't want one.

709
01:05:32,814 --> 01:05:34,974
Hama-vama!

710
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:48,093
Come.

711
01:05:56,492 --> 01:05:57,972
You wanted to see us?

712
01:05:58,051 --> 01:05:59,692
Take a chair.

713
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:10,291
Not there! Here!

714
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:23,810
Now, we were a bit unlucky
last night, chaps.

715
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:27,650
But to lighten the mood
and to celebrate my birthday,

716
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:30,687
I'm throwing a party at my house
on Saturday night,

717
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:32,810
and you're all invited!

718
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,490
Good!

719
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:42,047
Now, no birthday party would be complete
without a surprise stripper.

720
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:45,288
And I want one of you
to organize it. Ben.

721
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,449
Me?

722
01:06:47,489 --> 01:06:50,008
Yes. Here's 200 quid.

723
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:54,688
That should be plenty for some
top-shelf entertainment.

724
01:06:54,768 --> 01:06:57,605
I'll put the details on the staff board
this afternoon.

725
01:06:57,647 --> 01:07:00,367
Well, get going then.

726
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:06,647
So, where are you
gonna find a stripper?

727
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:10,167
I don't know.
But I know a man who will.

728
01:07:10,247 --> 01:07:15,565
So, your boss has given you 200 quid
to get a surprise stripper for his own birthday.

729
01:07:15,607 --> 01:07:19,126
I like him! Yeah, I'll help on one condition.

730
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:21,204
What's that?
I can come to the party.

731
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:25,993
Shouldn't be a problem.
Cool. Right, let's find you a stripper, eh?

732
01:07:50,885 --> 01:07:52,245
Two halves, please.

733
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:03,124
What was the other one?

734
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,684
Two halves.

735
01:08:04,723 --> 01:08:06,524
Oh, yeah.

736
01:08:06,604 --> 01:08:09,494
I just found the world's
stupidest barman.

737
01:08:10,922 --> 01:08:14,775
Sure, I'm not sure about this.
No, it's gonna be fine.

738
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:19,883
That's three quid, mate.

739
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,399
Yeah!

740
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,480
How much? Quid.

741
01:09:06,879 --> 01:09:08,958
Each.

742
01:09:16,038 --> 01:09:18,928
I was, uh, wondering
if you could help us.

743
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:24,798
Um, it's his boss's
birthday on saturday,

744
01:09:24,877 --> 01:09:29,475
and we were looking for someone
who could come and do a surprise, uh, strip.

745
01:09:29,517 --> 01:09:31,838
I'm busy on Saturday.

746
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:36,957
Oh, um, well, do you know anyone
else who might be available?

747
01:09:37,037 --> 01:09:40,996
I know one.
But she's very expensive.

748
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:43,877
That's cool.
Is she here?

749
01:09:43,957 --> 01:09:47,277
No. She only does
private venues.

750
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:50,178
She's gorgeous.
Top of the line, you see.

751
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:54,036
Hiya, Ben.

752
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:08,474
Will you be my date?

753
01:10:29,474 --> 01:10:31,874
Ben!
Huh?

754
01:10:31,954 --> 01:10:34,033
200.
What?

755
01:10:34,072 --> 01:10:36,352
200 for the stripper.

756
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:38,152
Oh.

757
01:10:38,232 --> 01:10:40,512
Don't worry, love,
she's class.

758
01:10:41,553 --> 01:10:43,872
Okay.
Great.

759
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,993
Two tickets
to Pittsburgh!

760
01:10:51,272 --> 01:10:55,671
It was now my fourth
straight week without sleep.

761
01:10:55,711 --> 01:11:01,070
I had slowly stopped thinking about Suzy
and had dragged myself into the present.

762
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:05,108
The extra eight hours of my life
had done nothing to slow the effect of time.

763
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:08,429
The minutes flew into hours,
the hours into days.

764
01:11:08,471 --> 01:11:12,461
And the days joined
the fast rushing river of time.

765
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:16,550
The bad news
is that time flies.

766
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:20,109
The good news
is that you're the pilot.

767
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:24,455
Most of my shifts were now spent
thinking about Sharon.

768
01:11:30,349 --> 01:11:33,588
I drew her endlessly.
Over and over.

769
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:39,509
Her pale, milky skin.
Her delicate frame.

770
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:46,279
In her eyes,
I could see the world.

771
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:53,545
I thought about Sharon escaping
the life-sapping neons of the supermarket…

772
01:11:53,587 --> 01:11:56,308
traveling to South America,

773
01:11:56,388 --> 01:11:58,907
pursuing her dreams.

774
01:11:58,987 --> 01:12:01,986
I thought about her
asking me to go with her.

775
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:04,826
Both sharing in our dreams.

776
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:08,719
Her love of people,
and my love of painting them.

777
01:12:28,706 --> 01:12:31,464
You off home?
Yeah.

778
01:12:31,505 --> 01:12:35,342
You still wanna be my date for
the party tomorrow night then?

779
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,025
Yeah, of course.

780
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:39,182
Will you come by
and pick me up?

781
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:41,024
Yeah.

782
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,985
8:00?

783
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,343
Yeah, 8:00.
Okay. See you tomorrow.

784
01:12:58,383 --> 01:13:01,182
Sharon had broken the spell.

785
01:13:01,263 --> 01:13:03,701
For the first time
in weeks, I slept.

786
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:07,596
I slept right through
to the following afternoon.

787
01:13:08,982 --> 01:13:11,182
Mmm. Yeah?

788
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:14,541
There's a call for you, Ben.

789
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:22,219
Hello?
Hello, is this Ben Willis?

790
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:23,822
Yeah.

791
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:26,820
My name is Alex Prout,
from the Prout gallery.

792
01:13:26,862 --> 01:13:31,541
I saw some examples of your work
at the university yesterday.

793
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:34,220
Y-you did?

794
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:39,834
Yes. And I'd be very interested
in putting on a show of your latest works.

795
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:43,579
Hello?

796
01:13:43,659 --> 01:13:46,500
Um, ah, yeah, yeah.
I would love to.

797
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,538
Great. Why don't you bring some
more examples of your work

798
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:52,980
down to my gallery
next Monday? Say 10:00?

799
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,860
Okay. Thank you.

800
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:58,020
No. Thank you, Ben!

801
01:13:58,099 --> 01:14:01,658
(Bugger off.)
You're the talent.

802
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:10,419
Better get ready
for the party.

803
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:13,009
Hello?
Hey, it's Ben.

804
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:15,810
Hi, Ben,
I'll be right down.

805
01:16:27,448 --> 01:16:28,809
Hiya.

806
01:16:29,769 --> 01:16:32,169
You look lovely.

807
01:16:32,249 --> 01:16:34,008
Thanks. You too.

808
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:39,007
Are you okay?

809
01:16:41,088 --> 01:16:42,686
I had some
great news today.

810
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,248
What?

811
01:16:44,327 --> 01:16:46,966
There's a gallery interested
in showing my work.

812
01:16:47,008 --> 01:16:48,927
Ben, that's fantastic!

813
01:16:49,007 --> 01:16:53,567
Look at you.
You're beaming inside out.

814
01:16:53,646 --> 01:16:57,606
Wow. You're on your way.

815
01:17:00,006 --> 01:17:03,007
Well, come on.
Let's go and celebrate.

816
01:17:35,565 --> 01:17:38,484
We can leave
if you want.

817
01:17:39,444 --> 01:17:40,884
Welcome!

818
01:17:41,843 --> 01:17:44,044
Hello, mate.

819
01:17:44,124 --> 01:17:45,923
Oy.

820
01:17:46,004 --> 01:17:47,443
Oy.

821
01:17:47,483 --> 01:17:49,444
Ben, this is, ahu
Katrine.

822
01:17:49,523 --> 01:17:51,323
Katrink.
Katrine!

823
01:17:51,403 --> 01:17:54,243
Katrine. Ben.
This is Sharon. Sean.

824
01:17:54,322 --> 01:17:56,603
I've heard a lot
about you.

825
01:17:56,643 --> 01:17:58,400
Nice to meet you.
Very sweet.

826
01:17:58,442 --> 01:17:59,842
Hi.

827
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:02,323
Oh, no.

828
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:04,922
Hi, Ben.

829
01:18:05,003 --> 01:18:06,441
Hi.Ben.
How are you?

830
01:18:06,522 --> 01:18:10,241
Oh, good, good. And you?
Thanks.

831
01:18:10,322 --> 01:18:12,002
Suzy, this is Sharon.

832
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:14,961
Nice to meet you.
And you.

833
01:18:15,002 --> 01:18:18,241
What are you doing here?
It's Steve's brother's birthday.

834
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:19,841
What, Jenkins?

835
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:23,441
Yeah. He's Steve's older brother.
Do you know him?

836
01:18:23,521 --> 01:18:25,201
Yeah. He's our boss.

837
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,159
You're working at Sainsbury's?
Yeah, I work the night shift.

838
01:18:28,201 --> 01:18:29,840
That's great.

839
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,921
Well, I'd better get back.

840
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,637
It was good to see you.
You too.

841
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,640
Nice to meet you.
You too.

842
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,959
You all right?

843
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:47,680
No, that's disgusting.
No, sorry.

844
01:20:10,713 --> 01:20:13,554
Isn't it great,
your brother's face!

845
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:16,034
Come on, Jenkins,
you rotten git!

846
01:20:16,113 --> 01:20:19,153
Kon-a-nichi-wa!

847
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:20,313
Yeah!

848
01:20:20,391 --> 01:20:21,752
Oh, no!

849
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:58,591
Natalie!
Sean?

850
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:00,830
Who's Natalie?

851
01:21:00,909 --> 01:21:02,869
It's a long story.

852
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:05,948
Well, your act's grown leaps
and bounds since the garage.

853
01:21:05,989 --> 01:21:08,469
God, how long ago was that?
Hum.

854
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,186
Will you, ah.
Will you stay for a drink?

855
01:21:16,228 --> 01:21:18,109
Yeah, I'd love to.

856
01:21:27,068 --> 01:21:29,428
Is this the queue
for the loo?

857
01:21:38,388 --> 01:21:40,147
Sharon!

858
01:21:40,227 --> 01:21:42,228
Thanks.
Happy birthday.

859
01:21:42,267 --> 01:21:44,028
Thanks.

860
01:21:47,427 --> 01:21:50,866
So, you wanna
come up to my bedroom?

861
01:21:50,946 --> 01:21:53,466
Eat some popcorn?
Shag?

862
01:21:53,546 --> 01:21:55,347
No.

863
01:21:55,427 --> 01:21:58,025
Why? What's the matter?
Don't you like popcorn?

864
01:21:58,067 --> 01:21:59,826
Barry's gonna do a stunt!

865
01:21:59,906 --> 01:22:03,743
Barry's gonna do a stunt!
Barry's gonna do a stunt! Everyone!

866
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:05,344
No, but seriously
though, Sharon.

867
01:22:05,385 --> 01:22:07,663
I always thought that one day
you and me might.

868
01:22:07,705 --> 01:22:09,745
Are you wearing
eyeliner?

869
01:22:20,425 --> 01:22:21,785
Hey, Ben.

870
01:22:22,784 --> 01:22:23,905
Hey.

871
01:22:26,745 --> 01:22:29,542
We really made a mess
of things, didn't we?

872
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:32,064
Wasn't that bad.

873
01:22:32,144 --> 01:22:37,024
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry about everything.

874
01:22:37,104 --> 01:22:40,221
I know I never really gave you
a chance to make me happy.

875
01:22:40,263 --> 01:22:43,661
You can't rely on other people
to make you happy, Suzy.

876
01:22:43,702 --> 01:22:45,222
I know!

877
01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:54,182
Is that you?

878
01:22:55,582 --> 01:22:59,541
Yeah. Jungle survival
course, Mexico.

879
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:01,262
But enough about me.

880
01:23:02,342 --> 01:23:03,781
You.

881
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:05,981
You!

882
01:23:07,422 --> 01:23:09,822
You look...

883
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,021
gorgeous tonight, Sharon.

884
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,498
I still think about you
all the time, Ben.

885
01:23:28,539 --> 01:23:30,620
Why are you
telling me this?

886
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:34,220
Have you seen Ben?

887
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,139
Five! Four!

888
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:39,499
Three! Two!

889
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,098
One! Go!

890
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,979
No.

891
01:24:19,336 --> 01:24:22,135
You can speed it up,
you can slow it down.

892
01:24:22,176 --> 01:24:24,574
You can even
freeze a moment.

893
01:24:24,616 --> 01:24:26,886
But you can't
rewind time.

894
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:29,304
You can't undo
what is done.

895
01:24:32,216 --> 01:24:35,215
I thought about
what she'd seen.

896
01:24:35,295 --> 01:24:37,573
I thought about
what she hadn't seen.

897
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:39,614
I thought about
how I could explain.

898
01:24:39,655 --> 01:24:41,973
But the more I thought about it,
the more I knew

899
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:45,373
nothing I could say
would make her anger go away.

900
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,772
How long could
I just wait there

901
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:50,015
delaying
the inevitable?

902
01:24:52,814 --> 01:24:55,212
I had sat there with the world
on pause for two days

903
01:24:55,254 --> 01:24:57,974
and still
no solution had come.

904
01:24:58,013 --> 01:25:00,453
I thought about the night
at the sports center

905
01:25:00,494 --> 01:25:04,348
when I'd seen a person move
when time was frozen.

906
01:25:04,574 --> 01:25:06,931
If other people could move
within the frozen world,

907
01:25:06,973 --> 01:25:09,771
then maybe it was something
I could bring Sharon in on.

908
01:25:09,812 --> 01:25:12,840
It was the best
I could come up with.

909
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:30,972
Sharon?

910
01:25:31,052 --> 01:25:32,732
I'm definitely winded.

911
01:25:32,812 --> 01:25:36,527
I had forgotten how fast
everything was moving.

912
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,410
Hello?

913
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:48,051
Sharon, it's me.

914
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,211
Hello?

915
01:26:34,048 --> 01:26:36,287
This felt familiar.

916
01:26:41,247 --> 01:26:44,412
I tried to explain
that Suzy was an ex.

917
01:26:44,486 --> 01:26:47,725
And she had attacked me
when my guard was down.

918
01:26:47,766 --> 01:26:50,924
Sharon had seen the wrong second
of a two-second story.

919
01:26:50,966 --> 01:26:53,245
But she wasn't listening.

920
01:27:59,362 --> 01:28:02,999
Member of cleaning staff
to aisle three, please.

921
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:06,137
Cleaning staff
to aisle three quickly.

922
01:28:41,599 --> 01:28:44,959
What language is that?
Russian.

923
01:28:44,998 --> 01:28:47,318
Do you speak Russian?
No.

924
01:28:47,397 --> 01:28:50,357
Can I get it back
on to English?

925
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:53,798
Yep? Can I help you?

926
01:28:53,878 --> 01:28:55,676
I've got an appointment
with Alex Prout.

927
01:28:55,718 --> 01:28:57,477
Yeah, that's me.

928
01:28:57,558 --> 01:28:59,758
Hi. Ben Willis.

929
01:29:03,116 --> 01:29:05,316
You called me
about my work.

930
01:29:05,396 --> 01:29:09,037
There must be some mistake.
I've never heard of you.

931
01:29:10,796 --> 01:29:13,077
You didn't call me?

932
01:29:23,076 --> 01:29:24,715
Bastards.

933
01:29:27,035 --> 01:29:30,596
Ah, sorry.
Someone's played a joke on me.

934
01:29:32,474 --> 01:29:35,501
Well, since you're here,
let me take a look.

935
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:50,714
These are yours?
Yeah.

936
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:59,153
You got any more?

937
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:01,993
Yeah, I've got hundreds.

938
01:30:02,072 --> 01:30:03,592
Can you bring them by?

939
01:30:03,672 --> 01:30:04,792
Sure.

940
01:30:08,073 --> 01:30:11,101
Why don't you make
an appointment with Lucy.

941
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:14,752
Proper one this time.
And we'll take it from there.

942
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:16,311
Yeah.

943
01:30:17,872 --> 01:30:19,711
Ben.

944
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:22,352
Ben.
All right, Ben.

945
01:31:20,027 --> 01:31:22,748
Well done.
Wonderful show.

946
01:31:22,788 --> 01:31:24,228
Thanks.

947
01:31:24,307 --> 01:31:28,091
I'm Anna. Anna Shapiro.
Ben Willis. Nice to meet you.

948
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:30,346
I've got a gallery
in New York.

949
01:31:30,387 --> 01:31:32,945
I'd be interested to talk
to you about your next show.

950
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,786
My next show?

951
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:37,146
Yes. Any ideas of what
you might like to do?

952
01:31:37,187 --> 01:31:38,906
Um...

953
01:31:43,786 --> 01:31:46,676
I'd like to go and paint
in South America.

954
01:31:47,746 --> 01:31:50,344
Well, that sounds
wonderfully romantic.

955
01:31:50,386 --> 01:31:53,866
Here. Take my card.

956
01:31:55,105 --> 01:31:56,185
Call me.

957
01:31:57,264 --> 01:31:58,385
Well done.

958
01:32:51,062 --> 01:32:51,982
Hey.

959
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:54,941
Hey.

960
01:32:54,982 --> 01:32:57,701
Congratulations.
This is...

961
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,061
so great.

962
01:33:01,141 --> 01:33:02,500
Thanks.

963
01:33:02,581 --> 01:33:05,780
How have you been?
Good.

964
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:08,301
I haven't seen you
at work.

965
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:11,065
No, I've got a job
at a travel agent's.

966
01:33:12,499 --> 01:33:15,251
So you're one step closer
to your dream.

967
01:33:20,259 --> 01:33:23,698
Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened at the party.

968
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:27,377
Whether you saw the second after
or not, it doesn't matter.

969
01:33:27,419 --> 01:33:30,216
I've learned it's what you do with
every single second that counts.

970
01:33:30,258 --> 01:33:31,938
Shh. It's okay.

971
01:33:34,019 --> 01:33:37,528
This tells me so much more
than you could ever say.

972
01:33:45,738 --> 01:33:47,858
It's snowing outside.

973
01:33:54,777 --> 01:33:56,896
Do you trust me?

974
01:33:56,936 --> 01:33:58,336
Why?

975
01:33:59,417 --> 01:34:01,457
I need to know.

976
01:34:20,936 --> 01:34:23,294
What happened?

977
01:34:23,374 --> 01:34:26,015
I need to show
you something.

978
01:34:51,334 --> 01:34:55,612
Once upon a time,
I wanted to know what love was.

979
01:34:55,693 --> 01:34:58,613
Love is there
if you want it to be.

980
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,170
You just have to see
that it's wrapped in beauty

981
01:35:01,212 --> 01:35:05,065
and hidden away between
the seconds of your life.

982
01:35:08,052 --> 01:35:10,210
If you don't stop
for a minute,

983
01:35:10,252 --> 01:35:11,972
you might miss it.

984
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,360
Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry!

985
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,119
Barry! Ooh! Oh!
