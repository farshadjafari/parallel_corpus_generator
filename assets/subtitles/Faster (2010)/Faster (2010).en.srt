3
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:45,926
Turn around.

4
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,003
I'll bite your head off.

5
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,974
I'll see you out there. Yeah.

6
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:12,244
- Yeah, motherfuckers.
- We'll fuck your ass up, man.

7
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:16,585
In The Prophet, Kahlil
Gibran writes about good and evil.

8
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,919
"Of the good in you, I can speak,

9
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:22,088
but not of the evil."

10
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:27,492
You are only good
when you are at one with yourself.

11
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:36,202
What you went through in here
I wouldn't wish on any man.

12
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:38,839
But you survived.

13
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:41,845
You didn't ask for trouble.

14
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:50,652
But you didn't back down
from it either.

15
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,818
It was as if you were born
to the darkness in this place.

16
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,529
I hope to God

17
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:03,864
that this day,
you put that darkness behind you.

18
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:13,840
I want you to know
there is help on the outside.

19
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,645
So if you get to thinking it's too much
and you can't handle the pressure,

20
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,516
please call one of these numbers.

21
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:27,891
Do you have any questions?

22
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,660
Where's the exit?

23
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:15,284
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Hey!

24
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:17,584
Hey, what the hell?

25
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:19,724
May I help you?

26
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:22,562
Sir? Sir?

27
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,509
Now, that happens, we'll be...

28
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,219
Jesus.

29
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,108
How's it going, man?

30
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,511
You know how it is.
One day good, the next not so good.

31
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,953
Just have to go with the flow,
you know?

32
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:26,290
So, uh...

33
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:32,656
You don't trust me.

34
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,697
All right.

35
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:41,638
Man, what did I tell you
about that hairy change?

36
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:46,377
Okay, if you don't want my
business, I'll take it elsewhere.

37
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:47,879
It's your jones, holmes.

38
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:52,714
Wait a minute. Please.

39
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:58,219
I'm sorry. I was just
messing with you, okay?

40
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:01,353
It's me. You know me.

41
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:04,856
Please.

42
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:17,672
Okay, okay.

43
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,320
Oh, no.

44
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,820
Hey.

45
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,758
Will you look at that?

46
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,194
Looks like somebody got lost.

47
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:00,611
What do we got?

48
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:04,282
Wha...? What do we got?

49
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:06,682
- Yeah, I caught the case.
- No, you didn't.

50
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:09,688
Yeah.
You couldn't have.

51
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:11,419
Why is that?

52
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:16,962
Because Mallory would
never put you on my case.

53
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,633
I don't like this
any more than you do.

54
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,928
I'm weeks away from retirement,
got paperwork up my ass.

55
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:26,574
So when the supervising sergeant
tells me to jump,

56
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,935
I just go with the flow, baby.

57
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:36,310
You can't smoke in here.
Sorry.

58
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:39,385
Get me a good tight
shot of that exit wound.

59
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:43,655
It is being
reported that a gunman entered

60
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:47,522
a downtown Bakersfield building
this afternoon and opened fire,

61
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:49,687
killing an employee.
The suspect remains at large.

62
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:54,199
Stop!
He is described as a male in his 30s,

63
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:57,236
approximately 6"3" tall
with closely cropped hair.

64
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,908
Police have not yet released
the name of the victim.

65
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,591
The gunman was described
as armed and extremely dangerous.

66
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:23,121
Let me call you right back.

67
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,801
Well, well.

68
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:30,563
You've been a bad boy.

69
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,033
It's a nice set of wheels
I got you out there.

70
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:40,713
You got my money?

71
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,088
Hm.

72
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,287
Now, how'd you smuggle
that much money out of prison?

73
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:55,895
You don't wanna know.

74
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,763
I want the other names.

75
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,299
The price just went up.

76
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:08,465
It took me 10 years
to track down these people for you.

77
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,338
And it cost a lot of money.

78
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:13,139
And now I wants to re-negotiate.

79
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,444
Okay.

80
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:20,179
That's what I thought.
You're playing ball now.

81
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,187
The price just went down.

82
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,322
Kenny?

83
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:28,954
Kenny.

84
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,764
This here is
my Samoan friend.

85
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:37,336
Ultimate Fighting champion
over in Guam.

86
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:41,565
You don't know half the sick shit
they do over there just to win a title.

87
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:57,722
I know what that is.

88
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,258
I know who you are.
Who is he?

89
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:01,861
Brother,
I ain't got no beef with you.

90
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,362
Do what I pay you to do.

91
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,830
What are you doing?
This dude's a ghost.

92
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:10,132
I can't mess with no ghost.
You better get back.

93
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:14,503
I ain't messing with a ghost.
Bald-headed Precious. Get your...

94
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,637
Here, I owe you a refund.
Here you go.

95
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:24,584
He looks so familiar.

96
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:27,220
I have seen him somewhere,
I know it.

97
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,556
Really?

98
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:36,987
All right, here it comes.

99
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:39,398
Look at his face.

100
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,730
He knew
his number was up.

101
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:45,865
Wait a minute.

102
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:52,178
That's not just fear,
that's recognition.

103
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:54,907
He can't see where the gun is.

104
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,244
It's blocked by the partition.

105
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:58,885
He knew him.

106
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:01,186
Maybe.

107
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,118
Hello?
Marina.

108
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,259
Hey, it's me.
Do you know what time it is?

109
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:40,451
Yes, I know it's late, I'm sorry.

110
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:42,789
Call me right...
Okay, okay.

111
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:46,331
You're taking him to the game.
Yes, I'll be there tomorrow.

112
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:50,062
I'll pick him up tomorrow.
Yes, I'll be on time.

113
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:54,140
Don't let him down. Promise.
Yes, I promise.

114
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:56,967
But listen... Listen.

115
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:39,775
Morning.

116
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:42,245
I did a sequence
of poses this morning

117
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,908
that only 10 people
on the planet can do.

118
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,383
Ending with the corpse pose.

119
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,613
But you know what,
I'm done with yoga.

120
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:51,256
I beat it.

121
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:54,623
You beat yoga?
Yeah.

122
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:57,761
It's time to move on.

123
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,061
To what?

124
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:03,465
I don't know.

125
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,065
Something more ultimate.

126
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:15,974
I worry that a real corpse pose is the
only thing that's gonna satisfy you.

127
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,050
No, come on, not death.

128
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:20,814
Life.

129
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:22,853
Oh, I've never felt so alive.

130
00:18:23,057 --> 00:18:24,718
Really?
Yeah.

131
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:51,008
Got a new client for you.
I know you like a challenge.

132
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:54,184
We're gathering information
on locations.

133
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:56,322
I'll send you the target spec now.

134
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:59,119
The client thinks
the target's coming after him.

135
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:02,160
He needs the job done fast.
Okay.

136
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,162
Who's he?

137
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,536
It's not a question I ever ask.

138
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:02,516
Sure you don't wanna stay a while?
Hold that thought.

139
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:25,604
It's my work.

140
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:28,781
It's getting harder and harder
to go on these jobs.

141
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,451
You mentioned
this before at our last session.

142
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:35,248
- Can you take some time off?
- No, no, that's not an option.

143
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,423
My business is important.

144
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,059
You haven't told me
what it is you do now.

145
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:42,229
I'm a surgeon. I remove cancer.

146
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:45,422
Well, I'll have to take you
at your word.

147
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,467
You know, I have other patients
in the medical field.

148
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:52,436
They find it hard to handle
the stress associated with their jobs.

149
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:57,144
There's a lot of pressure when you
have someone's life in your hands.

150
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,950
Morning, Detective Cicero.

151
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,279
Sergeant Mallory.

152
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,520
Don't be mad.

153
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:11,285
You should've told me.

154
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:15,052
You're right, you should've
heard it from me. I'm sorry.

155
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,593
I should've told you.

156
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,067
Let him help you
with the case though.

157
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,634
So, what do we got?

158
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:32,069
You play fast and loose
with that "we" shit, cowboy.

159
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:35,309
We got our shooter.

160
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:39,847
We?

161
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:42,912
I got a call from the warden
at Murdoch.

162
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,990
He recognized our guy in the news.

163
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:48,923
Apparently, he made a lot of money
running contraband in prison.

164
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,258
Any gang affiliations?
Nope, did his whole 10.

165
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,459
No protection. A walk-alone.
They kept coming after him.

166
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:57,536
He kept knocking them down.

167
00:21:57,705 --> 00:21:59,138
I see he kept score.

168
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,935
All he had to do was flash that
and no one would screw with him.

169
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:08,938
He got popped for a bank job.
Ten years ago, Bakersfield First.

170
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:12,953
Don't be a hero, you got me?
Stay down.

171
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,816
Shooter was a bank robber...
He was the driver.

172
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:17,952
- Go, go.
- Get in.

173
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:33,101
Go, go, go!

174
00:22:38,346 --> 00:22:40,177
Look out.

175
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,752
What are you doing?

176
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:57,386
You're gonna get us killed.
He knows what he's doing.

177
00:22:57,565 --> 00:22:59,829
Do your thing, little brother.

178
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,490
Go, go, go.

179
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:11,044
Damn it, what's he doing?

180
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,348
Where you going?

181
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,778
They passed. They passed. Do it.

182
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:27,058
- I don't see anyone. Think we're clear.
- Slow down.

183
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,853
Slow down!

184
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:39,568
Turn it around.
Turn it around. You son of a...

185
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:42,166
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

186
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:44,276
- Cops, man!
- They're right there!

187
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,745
You're good. Go.
Cops, cops.

188
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:01,092
You're good, you're good.

189
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:04,454
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rip it. Rip it.

190
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,105
Now, he made a clean getaway.
So who collared him?

191
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:24,944
Good, this is where
it gets really interesting.

192
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,144
I wanna show you something.

193
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,390
Check this out.

194
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,290
Oh, my.

195
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:33,427
This is such a big help.

196
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:36,119
It takes me a long time
to get up those stairs.

197
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,458
You can put the things anywhere.
Okay.

198
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,531
You okay?
Yes.

199
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:47,263
Thank you for your concern.

200
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:51,172
You're very kind to help an old man.
Sure.

201
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:54,542
I'm gonna go.
Can I offer you something to drink?

202
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:58,115
I should be going.
No, let me get you something.

203
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:00,014
Please,
it's the least I can do.

204
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:04,487
Be nice to have a little
company for a change.

205
00:25:07,294 --> 00:25:09,660
You see,
I changed careers because l...

206
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,355
Well, I had some issues
I needed to resolve.

207
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:18,270
You know, I needed to test myself.

208
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:24,536
Mentally and physically.
Really re-create myself.

209
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:27,780
And now it's all become too easy.

210
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:30,507
Yes. Yes.

211
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:34,017
I'm bored, but I mean,
that's only part of it.

212
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,682
I mean, it's Lily.

213
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,222
She's a distraction.

214
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:40,825
Distractions can be a problem
in my work.

215
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:07,411
You were going to talk to her
about marriage and having a family.

216
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:10,250
Is that still something you want?

217
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:16,055
You know what? You're right.

218
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,126
I mean, she's the woman I wanna
spend the rest of my life with.

219
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,031
Are you gonna ask her
to marry you?

220
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:25,466
That's what I'll do.

221
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:27,231
I'll pop the question. Heh, heh.

222
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:31,143
Are you off your meds?
Yes.

223
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:34,109
As your therapist,
I have to advise against that.

224
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:35,645
Gotta go.

225
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:49,661
All right, look, there's two cars.

226
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:51,160
Quiet.

227
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:52,793
All right, you're good.

228
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,060
All right, you guys. Here we go.

229
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,227
Be quiet.

230
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,605
Back, back, back!

231
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:02,969
Hands up!

232
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:05,509
Back up.
Tell me what's going on here?

233
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,376
After the bank job, they got
ambushed by another crew.

234
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,414
Somebody set him up.

235
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:13,246
And somebody taped it?

236
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,945
Sick bastard made
his own personal snuff film.

237
00:27:16,123 --> 00:27:17,784
- Where's the money?
- Tell them.

238
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:20,324
I knew I remembered
this guy from somewhere.

239
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:22,119
Where did you get this?

240
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:25,924
First week I made detective,
Vice busted this porn operation.

241
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,830
I walked into the bullpen,
they were watching this.

242
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:31,664
I pretended I got a phone call,
had to walk out.

243
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,534
Didn't have the stomach for it.

244
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:35,764
Bank robbers, huh?

245
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:38,776
- Tough guys.
- Don't tell them.

246
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:41,948
I flipped it to Homicide,
but never went anywhere.

247
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:46,313
Why is that?
Never see the killers' faces, not once.

248
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:48,546
Where's the money?
Don't tell, bro.

249
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:50,189
- Brothers?
- Your brother?

250
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:52,518
- I don't see the resemblance.
- Yeah.

251
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:56,151
You want me to shoot him, huh?
Like the others?

252
00:27:57,164 --> 00:27:59,223
He's not gonna kill me,
he's bluffing.

253
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:03,000
Bluffing?
Two down and I'm bluffing?

254
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:05,569
- You want me to shoot him?
- Think twice.

255
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:07,764
You want me to shoot him, huh?
Like the others?

256
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:11,307
- Don't tell him.
- Don't shoot him.

257
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:14,208
He's not gonna shoot.
Let's tell him where it is.

258
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:16,281
But it's our only leverage.

259
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:19,113
I'm sorry I got you into this, bro.

260
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:21,345
Just tell me where the money is.

261
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:23,547
I bet you're a good student.

262
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:25,987
Yeah.

263
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:30,725
Thanks for the drink.
Sure.

264
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:32,864
I should get going.

265
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:54,043
Sorry I got you into this, bro.

266
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:56,583
Sorry I dragged you into this.

267
00:28:56,757 --> 00:28:59,248
- Last chance.
- Don't tell him, bro.

268
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:02,286
- Please, don't shoot him.
- Don't do it.

269
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:03,827
It's up to you.

270
00:29:03,997 --> 00:29:05,862
Don't you tell him, bro. Don't tell him.

271
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:10,301
Under the floorboards
in the kitchen.

272
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:11,937
There you go.

273
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:34,924
- Gary, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

274
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:38,155
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be okay, bro.

275
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,792
It's gonna be okay.

276
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:45,234
No!

277
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:47,771
Oh, Jesus, man, no.

278
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:49,067
No!

279
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,975
Gotta get that money.
Jesus, man.

280
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:10,826
Gary!

281
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:14,290
Told you wouldn't shoot him.

282
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,059
- Watch him.
- Okay.

283
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,135
See if he's lying.

284
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:19,496
I got it.

285
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:25,711
Lift this up in the bag.

286
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,170
Hey. Hey.

287
00:30:34,788 --> 00:30:36,619
Smile for the camera.

288
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:42,958
Smile for the camera.

289
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,475
I didn't know.

290
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:07,044
I didn't know
that was gonna happen.

291
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:13,254
Don't, please.
He made us do it.

292
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:36,448
Please don't hurt me.

293
00:31:37,351 --> 00:31:39,376
I'm not gonna hurt you.

294
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:15,011
Smile for the camera.

295
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,380
I'm gonna kill you all.

296
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:24,653
They killed him.

297
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:28,559
What do you mean they killed him?
He was dead.

298
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:32,858
At least for a little while anyway.
The hospital pronounced him DO A.

299
00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:41,507
Can you hear me?

300
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:45,041
Bullet hit, ricocheted around
his skull, came out his cheek.

301
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:48,238
He's got a plate holding
the back of his head together.

302
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,349
I mean, this guy refused to die.

303
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:56,514
And now, he must be going after
everyone in that video.

304
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,064
You said you wouldn't be late.
Where have you been?

305
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:11,261
I caught a case.

306
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:15,169
You're supposed to take Tommy to his game.
You made me late for my class.

307
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:18,539
I'm sorry, it's a big deal,
this case.

308
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:24,109
I saw it on TV.
I do not wanna hear about it.

309
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:27,252
You want me to have full custody?
I will take custody.

310
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:29,514
You know I don't want that.

311
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:33,125
Then take him to his baseball game.
Okay. All right.

312
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:35,419
What's up, champ?

313
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:41,357
What position they got you playing?
Don't play much.

314
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:44,302
Well, you got an arm
like a cannon.

315
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:46,564
I don't know why
they wouldn't let you.

316
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,367
I know.

317
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:52,271
Maybe I should have a talk
with that coach.

318
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:55,244
Maybe pinch-hit or something.
What do you say?

319
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:03,579
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Cicero.

320
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:06,624
There's been another shooting.
This could be our guy.

321
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:07,817
Yeah.

322
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,894
Mallory wants you
down at the scene.

323
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:14,966
Okay, I'll be there in a little bit.
4045 Danson Road. Got it?

324
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:16,227
I'll be there in an hour.

325
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:26,942
Hey, you know what,
I'm not gonna make it in today.

326
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:31,379
I'm taking my son to a baseball game.
It's really important that I be there.

327
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:35,149
Well, you know what?
That's just too bad.

328
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:37,083
All right, bye.

329
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:41,124
Good grief.
Can you imagine that?

330
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:44,593
I already told them I had
a ball game to go to today.

331
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:54,606
Incredible.
You're a full two hours late.

332
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:56,969
John, did you...?
So, what do we got?

333
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:58,474
What do you got?

334
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:01,872
Guy did the world
a favor on this one.

335
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:03,948
Found out
who shot our snuff films.

336
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:06,517
Excuse me.

337
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:10,178
So we got a telemarketer, a sex offender.
What's next, a lawyer?

338
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:12,348
Whole shebang
just got a lot weirder.

339
00:36:12,526 --> 00:36:15,324
Witnesses placed a
second shooter at the scene.

340
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:17,622
After our suspect
whacked Mr. Rogers,

341
00:36:17,797 --> 00:36:20,357
he had a little shootout
in the hall.

342
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:24,126
Maybe an armed neighbor.
Uh-uh.

343
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:25,964
No one recognized
this dude.

344
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:29,836
They exchanged gunfire then disappeared.
Both of them.

345
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,505
The second shooter,
any description?

346
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,476
The word "beautiful" came up.

347
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:38,980
Beautiful?
Like a movie star.

348
00:36:39,186 --> 00:36:40,813
He punked me.

349
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:42,413
He's really that good?

350
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:44,352
Good's not even the right word.

351
00:36:44,524 --> 00:36:47,391
I mean, you know,
the dude's completely artless.

352
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:51,657
I mean, there's no sophistication
to him whatsoever.

353
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:53,856
But he's pure, you know?

354
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:58,198
No fear, no hesitation.
There's nothing.

355
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:01,736
He as fast as you?
No, he's faster.

356
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:06,911
You'll get him.

357
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:10,246
How can you be so sure, hey?

358
00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:12,679
Because you always do.

359
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:19,782
Baby.
Yeah?

360
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:23,120
Marry me.

361
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:50,446
Hey, mister.

362
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,155
Goddamn it. Shit.

363
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:42,931
Is that what I think it is?

364
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:45,139
Oh, the tattoo?

365
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:48,272
Yeah. Tattoo.

366
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:53,210
Yeah, I was in the L.A. Crash Unit
before I got transferred up here.

367
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:57,985
Guns blazing, ass-kicking cops
with porno mustaches?

368
00:38:58,158 --> 00:38:59,182
That Crash?

369
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,691
Yeah, is it so hard
for you to believe?

370
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:03,394
Yeah.

371
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,027
Can I get in there?

372
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:10,898
That's where I met Marina,
actually. She was my CI.

373
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:13,536
You married your snitch?

374
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:17,138
Dude, that is wrong
on so many levels.

375
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,574
Well, she was in really bad shape.

376
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:23,375
Got in rehab and we fell in love
and there you go.

377
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:26,986
Was she the only one in rehab?

378
00:39:28,755 --> 00:39:30,518
That's ancient history.

379
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:33,556
You sure about that, Hoss?

380
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,884
Listen, I got 10 days
to retirement.

381
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:40,260
Full benefits for me and my family,
so why would I screw that up?

382
00:39:42,035 --> 00:39:43,400
It's all I got.

383
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:45,069
All right. Let's go.

384
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:46,705
How long you been clean?

385
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,774
Since my son was born.

386
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:53,439
Good for you.

387
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:18,799
David, come on.

388
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:20,972
David, did you forget something?

389
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:23,903
- You forgot my hug.
- Love you, Mommy.

390
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,336
Good job.

391
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:29,665
Oh, my God.

392
00:41:32,612 --> 00:41:33,772
You can't do this.

393
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,787
Why did you come?

394
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:47,656
There's nothing for you here.

395
00:41:53,132 --> 00:41:56,693
Why did you make me stop
coming to see you in prison?

396
00:41:59,472 --> 00:42:01,872
I didn't see any sense
of three wasted lives.

397
00:42:03,142 --> 00:42:04,769
Three?

398
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:07,571
Was that him?

399
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:10,379
The boy?

400
00:42:10,984 --> 00:42:12,315
David?

401
00:42:16,022 --> 00:42:17,284
You shouldn't think...

402
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:21,285
You did a dime.

403
00:42:21,728 --> 00:42:23,787
David's 8. Do the math.

404
00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:28,932
When you cut me off,
I gave the baby up.

405
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:33,900
Did you find a good family?

406
00:42:37,343 --> 00:42:40,005
I had an abortion.

407
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,448
I'm sorry.

408
00:43:08,908 --> 00:43:10,842
All right.

409
00:43:18,785 --> 00:43:22,277
They know what you're doing.
I saw it on TV.

410
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:26,118
I hope you kill them all.

411
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,876
Shall we begin?

412
00:43:56,689 --> 00:43:58,247
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

413
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,429
Let's start a family.

414
00:44:08,468 --> 00:44:10,436
Family?
Yeah.

415
00:44:10,803 --> 00:44:12,896
What's gotten into you?

416
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,705
We'll sell the house by the lake,

417
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,639
and we'll get a Craftsman
in Pasadena.

418
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:20,472
Fresh start.

419
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:29,313
You're serious about this,
aren't you?

420
00:44:32,492 --> 00:44:34,119
Yes.

421
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:36,659
And what about your work?

422
00:44:36,996 --> 00:44:38,691
Oh, um...

423
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:41,130
Well, what about it?

424
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:45,793
Would you quit before this job?
Absolutely.

425
00:44:46,706 --> 00:44:49,072
I will quit absolutely.

426
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:50,832
Just like that?

427
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:00,644
Just like that.

428
00:45:04,557 --> 00:45:06,252
Marina.

429
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:09,259
Let me in for a second,
I need to talk.

430
00:45:09,462 --> 00:45:12,260
I'm gonna stand here all day,
so you may as well.

431
00:45:13,466 --> 00:45:14,490
Marina.

432
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:20,705
- Killed, the first
victim was gunned down less than an hour

433
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:23,774
after the suspected gunman
was released from prison.

434
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:26,001
While the second victim
was shot...

435
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:27,646
What are you doing here?

436
00:45:27,814 --> 00:45:29,714
Thought you didn't care
about my case.

437
00:45:29,882 --> 00:45:32,544
- To a bank robbery
at Bakersfield 10 years ago.

438
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:36,685
Look, I do not need you coming here
and dragging us down again.

439
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:38,754
Marina, if you just...
No.

440
00:45:38,925 --> 00:45:40,859
I am getting
my associate's degree.

441
00:45:41,027 --> 00:45:44,292
I am trying to make something
better for Tommy and me.

442
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:46,226
Please take me back.

443
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:48,730
It'll be okay.

444
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:51,495
It's not okay.
Marina, I'm begging you.

445
00:45:51,704 --> 00:45:55,037
I'm begging you, please.
God. Get off your knees.

446
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:58,541
Marina, please. Just please...
Don't touch me.

447
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:00,542
Do not touch me.

448
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:04,906
Give me the dope.
I don't have any dope.

449
00:46:05,118 --> 00:46:07,086
Give it to me.

450
00:46:07,787 --> 00:46:11,279
Okay. Here.

451
00:46:12,225 --> 00:46:13,817
It's all I got.

452
00:46:14,393 --> 00:46:17,260
Look, I'll go to rehab.
I swear to God I will.

453
00:46:17,463 --> 00:46:19,158
Let's go. Let's go right now.

454
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:23,596
After the case, I gotta finish the case.
Well, I can't just walk out on that.

455
00:46:23,803 --> 00:46:25,896
I just wanna be with you
for one night.

456
00:46:26,072 --> 00:46:28,267
I mean, you know,
with Tommy and...

457
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:29,833
Please.

458
00:46:32,678 --> 00:46:34,771
Just one night.

459
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:49,961
- Radio...
- Twenty-five dollar gift cert...

460
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:52,658
Brother, put down that bottle.

461
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:56,429
Put down that cocaine,
that methamphetamine.

462
00:46:56,602 --> 00:47:01,972
Put down that.45,
that.38 and that.357 Magnum.

463
00:47:07,613 --> 00:47:10,309
So precious to each one of us.

464
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:12,347
Why?

465
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:15,217
The night is far gone,

466
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:18,720
the day is at hand.

467
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:23,391
Those that live by the sword
will die by the sword,

468
00:47:23,796 --> 00:47:25,957
unless they learn to forgive.

469
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,962
God made life so fragile
and so precious for each one of us.

470
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:39,237
You will never truly be free
unless you learn to...

471
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:43,343
Yo, I gotta take a leak.
I'll be right back.

472
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:54,393
Hold up, big man,
I gotta check you. Arms up.

473
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:16,075
Got any weapons on
you besides these guns here?

474
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:19,275
I'm only kidding, man.
Go on, have a good time.

475
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:22,282
Welcome to the gentlemen's club.

476
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:24,548
It's a two-drink minimum
tonight, baby.

477
00:48:31,964 --> 00:48:33,693
My man.

478
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,360
Hey, what's up, big dog?

479
00:48:39,272 --> 00:48:41,103
I'm great.

480
00:48:43,409 --> 00:48:45,172
Right.

481
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:55,743
Wake up, Joe.
Huh?

482
00:49:39,632 --> 00:49:41,930
I've been expecting you.

483
00:49:43,736 --> 00:49:45,328
Joe.

484
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:48,329
Joe.
Huh?

485
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,970
Oh, Shelly.

486
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:53,975
Go outside and watch the door.

487
00:49:56,115 --> 00:49:58,549
Only one of us
is gonna make it out of here.

488
00:49:59,452 --> 00:50:03,616
No matter who it is, Joe,
you didn't see a damn thing.

489
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:07,654
Go on.

490
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:44,151
All right, then.

491
00:51:34,346 --> 00:51:36,041
I got a son.

492
00:51:40,086 --> 00:51:42,919
Tell him I said I'm sorry.

493
00:51:46,492 --> 00:51:48,426
I'm begging you.

494
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,298
He's speed dial number three.

495
00:52:04,477 --> 00:52:08,436
I'm sorry.
He made us take you down.

496
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:34,636
Hello? Hello?

497
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:36,274
Your father's sorry.

498
00:52:36,442 --> 00:52:39,934
Who is this? Is he okay?

499
00:52:40,846 --> 00:52:43,041
Did something happen?

500
00:52:43,215 --> 00:52:45,012
Yeah.

501
00:52:45,784 --> 00:52:47,911
Something happened.

502
00:53:58,023 --> 00:54:00,491
I thought you said
you were done.

503
00:54:03,696 --> 00:54:05,527
I have to finish this one first.

504
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:09,724
You promised me you were quitting.
And I will. I will quit.

505
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:14,295
But after this one.

506
00:54:15,374 --> 00:54:17,205
No, this isn't fair.

507
00:54:18,244 --> 00:54:20,235
I didn't ask you to marry me.

508
00:54:20,412 --> 00:54:22,607
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

509
00:54:22,815 --> 00:54:24,248
Mm-hm.

510
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,212
What if I told you you had to choose?
Don't.

511
00:54:30,422 --> 00:54:32,947
You used to be attracted
to what I do.

512
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:36,420
I'm your wife now.

513
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:40,929
What if he kills you?
Lily.

514
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:57,645
Daddy?

515
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,315
Yeah?

516
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:05,056
I know I suck at baseball.
You don't have to pretend like I'm good.

517
00:55:09,762 --> 00:55:11,662
You'll get better.

518
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:14,128
You just need to practice.

519
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:18,024
Maybe you and I can throw the
ball around one day. How's that?

520
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:20,865
Okay.
I gotta tell you a secret first, though.

521
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,604
What, Daddy?
I suck at baseball too.

522
00:55:31,984 --> 00:55:36,114
You go to sleep, okay?
I'll be back.

523
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,157
Jesus Christ.

524
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,325
Oh, Jesus.

525
00:55:46,532 --> 00:55:50,161
Are you okay? Look at me, look at me.
Why did you do this?

526
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:51,826
I'm afraid.

527
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:55,072
What are you afraid of,
honey?

528
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,676
We're going to hell for what we did.

529
00:56:00,145 --> 00:56:02,045
Do you know what hell is?

530
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,611
It's not fire and devils.

531
00:56:06,118 --> 00:56:09,144
All that stuff they taught you
when you was little.

532
00:56:10,723 --> 00:56:15,456
We make our heaven
and our hell while we're alive,

533
00:56:17,696 --> 00:56:21,359
Every time we cause pain,

534
00:56:22,768 --> 00:56:26,169
every time we cause suffering.

535
00:57:35,674 --> 00:57:38,472
Cicero.
Hey, it's me. Did I wake you up?

536
00:57:38,644 --> 00:57:39,702
No.

537
00:57:39,912 --> 00:57:42,904
You said on your message
to give you a call, so...

538
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:44,742
Okay, here's the deal.

539
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:48,114
Both of our victims
were informants.

540
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,779
- Could be something there, right?
- Yeah, could be.

541
00:57:52,157 --> 00:57:53,385
Nice work.

542
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:55,151
Okay, I need you to follow up on it.

543
00:57:55,327 --> 00:57:58,626
I gotta be in court,
but I really think we're getting close.

544
00:57:58,797 --> 00:58:02,233
It's gotta have something to do
with how they got set up.

545
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:06,870
Did you hear about that stabbing
in Henderson?

546
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,805
Yeah, yeah, what about it?
I got a hunch it might be our guy.

547
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:13,944
It's not his m.o.
Our guy's a shooter, not a stabber.

548
00:58:14,112 --> 00:58:16,979
Like I said, I got a hunch.
Yeah, so did Quasimodo.

549
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:20,346
Look where it got him.
I'm gonna go ask a few questions.

550
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:22,384
After you do the follow-up, right?

551
00:58:22,554 --> 00:58:26,012
Got it cleared with the Henderson IC.
I'm headed up there now.

552
00:58:26,191 --> 00:58:30,525
I have to be in court all day.
I am asking you to do this. It's my case.

553
00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:43,274
- Bring us nothing
but the same politics as usual.

554
00:58:43,475 --> 00:58:45,909
I have fought
to keep government honest,

555
00:58:46,078 --> 00:58:48,342
save you money
and to lower your taxes.

556
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:51,074
Above all,
I will be someone who listens to you.

557
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:54,411
The choice is simple,
vote Margie Pageant.

558
00:58:54,653 --> 00:58:57,816
In local news, a Henderson
man is fighting for his life

559
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,925
after being brutally attacked
at a gentlemen's club.

560
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:03,323
The man is suffering
from stab wounds.

561
00:59:03,495 --> 00:59:06,931
Doctors describe his condition
as critical.

562
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:08,726
Hello?

563
00:59:19,878 --> 00:59:21,573
- Sponge.
- Sponge.

564
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:34,848
We think he'll
be heading back. Your position?

565
00:59:35,027 --> 00:59:37,928
Tehachapi.
Try the hospital in Clark County.

566
00:59:38,397 --> 00:59:42,333
His third victim survived the hit.
He'll be wanting to finish the job.

567
01:00:00,419 --> 01:00:01,977
Where are you?

568
01:00:27,245 --> 01:00:28,940
Good night.

569
01:01:12,157 --> 01:01:13,818
Doctor.

570
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:25,862
What the hell is that?

571
01:01:30,242 --> 01:01:34,201
Back in the room, back in the room.
Police officer, get back.

572
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:38,308
- Police.
- He went that way.

573
01:01:39,885 --> 01:01:43,184
I'm a cop. Where'd he go?
He went downstairs, officer.

574
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,741
How do you have my dad's phone?

575
01:04:20,478 --> 01:04:22,343
He asked me to call you.

576
01:04:22,514 --> 01:04:24,744
Are you the one who killed him?

577
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:26,208
Yes.

578
01:04:26,384 --> 01:04:29,547
I'm gonna find you
and I'm gonna kill you.

579
01:04:29,754 --> 01:04:31,153
Do what you need to do.

580
01:04:38,496 --> 01:04:39,861
But you better be sure,

581
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:43,159
because it's a long, dark road
you're headed down.

582
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:44,178
I lost him.

583
01:06:44,356 --> 01:06:45,789
Client wants to pull the job.

584
01:06:45,957 --> 01:06:48,517
No. No way.
You tell him to back off.

585
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,696
I've got this under control. All right?
You're running out of time.

586
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:36,537
Where's the old man?

587
01:07:37,242 --> 01:07:38,869
Dead.

588
01:07:39,077 --> 01:07:42,535
Don't lie to me.
I'll show you the damn grave.

589
01:07:43,515 --> 01:07:45,107
How long ago?
I don't know.

590
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:47,818
Three or four years.

591
01:07:54,259 --> 01:07:56,056
Hold still.

592
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:05,730
Okay.

593
01:08:23,154 --> 01:08:24,587
How long you been out?

594
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,255
Couple of days.

595
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:29,456
And why are you here?

596
01:08:31,296 --> 01:08:33,662
Came here to kill the old man.

597
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:35,423
Why?

598
01:08:37,769 --> 01:08:39,293
Because he set us up.

599
01:08:41,139 --> 01:08:42,572
What makes you think that?

600
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:46,733
Gary went to him for advice on the
bank job and he wanted full share.

601
01:08:46,945 --> 01:08:48,435
Gary wouldn't give it to him.

602
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:54,175
So do you think the old man was
capable of murdering his own son?

603
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:58,316
Yeah.
No.

604
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:01,119
Mm-mm.

605
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:03,089
Nope.

606
01:09:04,496 --> 01:09:06,157
He couldn't have.

607
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:08,593
What makes you so sure?

608
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:14,496
I just... I just know.

609
01:09:16,174 --> 01:09:17,766
Tell me.

610
01:09:19,277 --> 01:09:20,608
Say it.

611
01:09:23,848 --> 01:09:25,281
Mom.

612
01:09:26,718 --> 01:09:28,515
Because...

613
01:09:30,421 --> 01:09:32,946
he loved your brother too much.

614
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,457
I'm sorry.

615
01:09:39,497 --> 01:09:42,489
And that's the truth
and that's not your fault.

616
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:45,158
It wasn't like
I could pretend you were his.

617
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:50,339
He was reminded of that
every time he looked at you.

618
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:57,377
You never stood a chance.

619
01:09:59,517 --> 01:10:03,180
Sorry that I couldn't...

620
01:10:03,354 --> 01:10:07,484
That I didn't protect you.

621
01:10:09,327 --> 01:10:11,352
The beatings and...

622
01:10:17,268 --> 01:10:19,702
Gary was the only one
who ever cared for me.

623
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:21,633
Why'd he pull you in on that job?

624
01:10:21,806 --> 01:10:23,569
You were never a part
of what they did.

625
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:25,902
When his driver fell out,
I volunteered.

626
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:27,271
Why?

627
01:10:28,112 --> 01:10:30,876
He owed the wrong people
a lot of money.

628
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:34,417
And he needed me.

629
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,069
If it wasn't the old man,
then who set us up?

630
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:50,617
Driven by his passions and desires.

631
01:11:50,795 --> 01:11:55,562
You will never truly be free
unless you freely forgive.

632
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:58,258
Hate is like a chain
around your neck

633
01:11:58,436 --> 01:12:01,701
that leads you to places
you don't wanna go.

634
01:12:01,873 --> 01:12:05,365
It'll lead you into darkness
and desolation.

635
01:12:05,576 --> 01:12:07,942
You become a slave
to that hatred,

636
01:12:08,112 --> 01:12:10,979
and it'll only lead
to your own destruction.

637
01:12:11,149 --> 01:12:13,174
You must break free.

638
01:12:26,964 --> 01:12:29,489
Hey, cowboy.
You okay, man?

639
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:31,726
- Yeah.
- You laid eyes on him at least.

640
01:12:31,903 --> 01:12:33,530
Hey, well done.
Thanks, man.

641
01:12:33,738 --> 01:12:34,966
I gotta call you back.

642
01:12:35,139 --> 01:12:37,198
- Still in one piece.
- Good job.

643
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:40,037
Good lead, cowboy.
You almost got him.

644
01:12:40,211 --> 01:12:41,508
We got close.
Yeah.

645
01:12:53,658 --> 01:12:55,057
It was a good hunch.

646
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,160
Well, even Quasimodo
has his day.

647
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:02,266
And don't ever hang up on me again.
Roger that.

648
01:13:05,236 --> 01:13:08,501
I hate to spoil your moment.
Got something I wanna show you.

649
01:13:08,673 --> 01:13:12,404
I think we may have caught a break.
You said "we" again.

650
01:13:13,878 --> 01:13:15,368
I did.

651
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:20,540
Our latest victim was a CI too.

652
01:13:20,718 --> 01:13:21,776
So all three are informants.

653
01:13:21,953 --> 01:13:25,081
Mm-hm. All got records,
armed robbery, rape, assault.

654
01:13:25,256 --> 01:13:27,156
But none did any serious time.

655
01:13:27,358 --> 01:13:30,589
They all snitched their way
out of the joint over and over.

656
01:13:30,795 --> 01:13:33,457
What are the odds of that?
Slim and none.

657
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:36,223
I'm waiting on
the informant logs now.

658
01:13:36,401 --> 01:13:39,393
Who are these?
Former accomplices of the victims.

659
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:42,437
Let's split them up, check them out.
I'll take these.

660
01:13:42,607 --> 01:13:47,544
And I know there's not
a man, woman or child in this church today

661
01:13:47,712 --> 01:13:50,704
that has not sinned.

662
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:55,909
But God did not bring you down
on this Earth to be perfect. No.

663
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,748
God wants you down here
to be saved.

664
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:05,957
And when you're down with God,
God is eternally down with you.

665
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:27,446
When Jesus knew his
time was near, when he knew he was gonna die,

666
01:14:27,618 --> 01:14:31,145
when he knew they would not take
that cup from his lips,

667
01:14:31,322 --> 01:14:34,018
his thoughts were not
upon his own.

668
01:14:34,225 --> 01:14:36,921
His thoughts were for those
that he loved.

669
01:14:37,094 --> 01:14:38,789
- Amen.
- That's right.

670
01:14:38,963 --> 01:14:42,126
His thoughts were for those
that he loved, preparing them.

671
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,293
Why is that?
He used the example of his birth.

672
01:14:46,471 --> 01:14:49,497
That's right. Here it is.
Jesus told them how a woman

673
01:14:49,674 --> 01:14:53,303
goes through pain and sorrow
in the throes of childbirth.

674
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:58,005
But then as soon as she has delivered,
there is no more anguish.

675
01:15:02,153 --> 01:15:06,146
After all the screaming,
after all the pushing,

676
01:15:06,324 --> 01:15:09,157
after all the blood and the tears,

677
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,158
there's only joy that a new child
has been born.

678
01:15:12,363 --> 01:15:13,853
Hallelujah!

679
01:15:14,065 --> 01:15:16,966
- And I'll tell you my...
- Amen! Amen!

680
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,335
Amen.

681
01:15:26,377 --> 01:15:29,972
Amen. Amen. Amen.

682
01:15:36,053 --> 01:15:37,520
Hallelujah!
Amen!

683
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:41,089
Amen!
Sing me a song!

684
01:16:03,915 --> 01:16:06,748
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

685
01:16:11,355 --> 01:16:15,724
You've been the subject of many of
my sermons these past few days.

686
01:16:16,527 --> 01:16:17,858
I heard.

687
01:16:20,431 --> 01:16:23,832
You heard.
But did you listen?

688
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,437
Everything okay,
baby?

689
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:32,808
Everything's just fine,
honey.

690
01:16:32,977 --> 01:16:35,707
I was just catching up with

691
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,040
an old acquaintance.

692
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:47,448
You go on home now.

693
01:17:01,973 --> 01:17:04,066
Let's take a walk.

694
01:17:21,492 --> 01:17:24,120
Was that your son?
Adopted.

695
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:26,192
One of five.

696
01:17:26,664 --> 01:17:28,757
Wayward boys.

697
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,925
Not unlike me or you
at that age.

698
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:35,170
You turned your life around.

699
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:38,141
Doesn't change
what you did.

700
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:41,175
I wouldn't want it to.

701
01:17:42,413 --> 01:17:44,313
I know it sounds cold,

702
01:17:44,482 --> 01:17:47,542
but every good I've done
hinged on the evil I did.

703
01:17:47,718 --> 01:17:50,983
Who set us up?
I don't know.

704
01:17:51,155 --> 01:17:54,522
I never did find out how they
knew about your safe house.

705
01:17:54,725 --> 01:17:58,525
When I got the call,
"Easy money", they said.

706
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:03,929
All I had to do was guard
the door, be the lookout.

707
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:09,130
I was in a dark place
in my life.

708
01:18:09,306 --> 01:18:12,002
Numb to the chaos and...
Right here.

709
01:18:14,378 --> 01:18:16,471
But when they cut
that boy's throat...

710
01:18:18,182 --> 01:18:20,082
Oh, Jesus, man. No.

711
01:18:26,524 --> 01:18:30,051
That boy they killed was my brother.

712
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:35,361
I can't bring him back.

713
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:39,169
And in my heart I'm sorry.

714
01:18:41,739 --> 01:18:46,176
I still took my cut,
spent it on drugs and women.

715
01:18:47,912 --> 01:18:49,345
Ended up in prison.

716
01:18:50,781 --> 01:18:54,376
But it was there
that I found my calling.

717
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:59,920
To save and help boys like me.

718
01:19:00,091 --> 01:19:02,423
And like you.

719
01:19:02,626 --> 01:19:04,856
It was there
that I gave my life to God.

720
01:19:06,297 --> 01:19:08,390
God can't save you from me.

721
01:19:11,936 --> 01:19:14,598
But maybe he could save you
from yourself.

722
01:19:15,906 --> 01:19:18,204
I know there's good...
You don't know me.

723
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:20,741
I know the devil
got your heart twisted

724
01:19:20,945 --> 01:19:23,140
with vengeance and hate.

725
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:27,578
The Lord is merciful.
He sees in your soul.

726
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:36,251
Fragile, ain't it?

727
01:19:39,163 --> 01:19:43,896
That moment, that sets us
on our road to Damascus.

728
01:19:44,735 --> 01:19:46,532
Sermon's over.

729
01:19:51,075 --> 01:19:56,172
Can you at least find it in your heart
to forgive me for what I did?

730
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:01,077
I can't.

731
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,925
That's all right.

732
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:16,194
That's all right.

733
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:21,333
Because I forgive you
for what you're about to do.

734
01:20:54,138 --> 01:20:58,336
Lord, see into this man's heart.
He's good inside.

735
01:20:58,509 --> 01:21:00,568
Oh, Lord, save this man's soul.

736
01:21:00,744 --> 01:21:02,644
I know you see his heart.

737
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:14,352
Release him from the bondage
of hatred and vengeance, Lord.

738
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:42,148
Go back to your family.

739
01:22:57,661 --> 01:23:00,152
That's one hell of a peashooter
you got there.

740
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:02,994
How's the recoil?

741
01:23:32,863 --> 01:23:34,125
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

742
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:38,392
Inyo County at the reservoir.
They're here. Both of them.

743
01:23:38,569 --> 01:23:41,299
What? Did you call for backup?

744
01:23:41,505 --> 01:23:44,133
There's no time for that.
Okay, don't do this.

745
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:46,400
I'm sorry
I keep stepping on your case.

746
01:23:46,577 --> 01:23:49,569
I don't care about that.
Want you to do me a favor.

747
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,907
If I don't make it out of this,

748
01:23:52,082 --> 01:23:54,846
tell my son that
his daddy went out like a man.

749
01:23:55,019 --> 01:23:57,852
I am on my way.
Please, just wait for me.

750
01:23:58,022 --> 01:23:59,717
I'm just going with the flow.

751
01:24:01,325 --> 01:24:02,485
Damn.

752
01:24:11,835 --> 01:24:13,496
Aren't you gonna
reach for it?

753
01:24:16,173 --> 01:24:17,333
Come on.

754
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,803
Sporting chance.

755
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,303
I've got nothing against you.

756
01:24:23,514 --> 01:24:28,008
I've been trying to kill you for days
and you've got nothing against me?

757
01:24:29,053 --> 01:24:32,545
I'm starting to think you don't
take me very seriously, friend.

758
01:24:36,226 --> 01:24:37,250
What do you want from me?

759
01:24:37,428 --> 01:24:39,919
How about a little respect? Hey?

760
01:24:40,097 --> 01:24:42,588
A little professional courtesy
from a peer.

761
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:45,063
Some acknowledgment
of my skills.

762
01:24:48,272 --> 01:24:49,569
You've got issues.

763
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:55,703
Screw you.

764
01:25:08,659 --> 01:25:10,388
I win.

765
01:25:22,406 --> 01:25:23,600
You think you're done?

766
01:25:26,276 --> 01:25:28,744
You can't put it together, can you?

767
01:25:30,948 --> 01:25:33,576
There must be one more.

768
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:41,089
The one who hired me.

769
01:25:43,627 --> 01:25:44,992
He's still alive.

770
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:50,831
I'm gonna kill you all.

771
01:25:57,841 --> 01:25:58,933
Drop the gun.

772
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:01,539
Don't move.

773
01:26:01,712 --> 01:26:02,974
Slowly.

774
01:26:03,847 --> 01:26:05,178
Put the gun down.

775
01:26:07,184 --> 01:26:09,118
No.
Put the goddamn gun down.

776
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:11,480
No! This is my job!

777
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:14,782
I finish my job.

778
01:26:14,992 --> 01:26:17,552
How you gonna finish this
when you're dead?

779
01:27:10,214 --> 01:27:12,205
So you're the guy that hired me.

780
01:27:16,286 --> 01:27:18,379
You shouldn't
have done that.

781
01:27:19,022 --> 01:27:21,547
I had to finish what I started.

782
01:27:23,293 --> 01:27:24,783
Why'd you hire me then?

783
01:27:25,896 --> 01:27:27,921
I didn't think I was up to it.

784
01:27:28,098 --> 01:27:31,465
After you missed him,
I figured I should get involved

785
01:27:31,635 --> 01:27:34,399
before he came gunning for me.

786
01:27:37,908 --> 01:27:39,876
He didn't even know about you.

787
01:27:40,377 --> 01:27:43,505
I figured that out when he didn't
finish me off at the hospital.

788
01:27:45,816 --> 01:27:49,308
His brother's girlfriend
was my informant down in L.A.

789
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,410
She told me about the job.

790
01:27:51,955 --> 01:27:54,321
Hired some more of my informants
down there.

791
01:27:54,524 --> 01:27:56,822
They helped me take down
their score.

792
01:28:02,466 --> 01:28:03,797
So, what now?

793
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:05,729
Now?

794
01:28:07,104 --> 01:28:09,937
I ride off into the sunset.

795
01:28:19,783 --> 01:28:21,045
Hey.

796
01:28:22,919 --> 01:28:24,284
I forgot to pay you.

797
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,483
You know,
I don't get you.

798
01:28:27,658 --> 01:28:31,321
Why do you put yourself through all
this shit for one lousy dollar?

799
01:28:31,495 --> 01:28:34,464
It's my price.
Call it a hobby.

800
01:28:35,799 --> 01:28:37,460
You know what, keep it.

801
01:28:38,168 --> 01:28:39,692
I didn't earn it.

802
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:42,430
Don't contact me again,
I'm done.

803
01:28:43,874 --> 01:28:45,409
Yeah, me too.

804
01:28:47,311 --> 01:28:48,335
Detective Cicero?

805
01:28:48,512 --> 01:28:49,672
Yeah, I can't reach him.

806
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:51,643
Okay, hopefully he'll turn up.

807
01:28:51,848 --> 01:28:54,476
We've got units en route,
we'll see you shortly.

808
01:28:56,586 --> 01:28:58,213
Wait a minute.

809
01:29:02,859 --> 01:29:04,554
You didn't flip him this case,
did you?

810
01:29:05,362 --> 01:29:06,693
I didn't flip him the case.

811
01:29:06,897 --> 01:29:08,330
Is that what you thought?

812
01:29:08,498 --> 01:29:09,897
He asked for it, right?

813
01:29:10,133 --> 01:29:11,361
He begged for it.

814
01:29:11,601 --> 01:29:14,468
And I felt sorry for him, so I caved.

815
01:29:14,671 --> 01:29:18,107
Is there a reason why we're
talking about this right now?

816
01:29:18,508 --> 01:29:21,739
No. No reason.
Okay, I'll see you shortly.

817
01:29:24,614 --> 01:29:26,343
"Go with the flow", my ass.

818
01:29:28,418 --> 01:29:33,754
Marina? Hey, it's me, honey.
Well, I got him, I closed the case.

819
01:29:33,924 --> 01:29:35,482
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

820
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:39,720
As a matter of fact, I feel perfect.

821
01:29:39,896 --> 01:29:42,091
- Better than I ever have.
- Yeah?

822
01:29:42,265 --> 01:29:45,826
Yeah, and I'm gonna
get rid of the other stuff too.

823
01:29:46,002 --> 01:29:48,402
Don't you worry, I promise.

824
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:51,505
I'll be home in a couple hours.

825
01:29:51,675 --> 01:29:55,406
Listen, you're not gonna
believe this.

826
01:29:56,513 --> 01:30:00,244
I've been reading up on women,
and I think I got you figured out.

827
01:30:01,518 --> 01:30:03,577
We're gonna be fine.

828
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:07,146
Yeah, honey, it's over.

829
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:12,585
I wanna start brand-new, honey.

830
01:30:36,486 --> 01:30:38,215
How?

831
01:30:41,992 --> 01:30:43,926
Metal plate.

832
01:30:53,136 --> 01:30:55,331
I can't feel anything.

833
01:31:00,977 --> 01:31:03,445
I created my own hell.

834
01:31:09,152 --> 01:31:12,280
And I'm the demon
who crawled up out of it.

835
01:31:44,321 --> 01:31:45,845
Hello?

836
01:31:46,022 --> 01:31:47,046
Baby.

837
01:31:47,224 --> 01:31:50,352
- Where are you?
- I'm coming home.

838
01:33:17,581 --> 01:33:23,884
Today, I wanna talk to you
about forgiveness.
