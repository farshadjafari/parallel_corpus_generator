1
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,731
I hereby decree that Prime Minister Cao Cao

2
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,024
lead the Imperial Army

3
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:27,193
to pacify the rebels Liu Bei
and Sun Quan.

4
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,862
Thank you, Your Majesty.

5
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,424
These people are loyal
to the Han Empire.

6
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,427
They followed us
to escape Cao Cao's regime.

7
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,722
If we do not protect civilians,

8
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,765
then what is the meaning
of this war?

9
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,813
An alliance will strengthen us both.

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:15,784
When a loser joins forces with a coward
what can they accomplish?

11
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,414
What the Southlands need is unity!

12
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,045
My decision to fight is final.

13
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,799
Anyone who dares
mention surrender

14
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,176
will end up like this table!

15
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,515
You need to fight this war.

16
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,727
I am not afraid of him.

17
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,313
I have been waiting for this day!

18
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,442
We shall fight,
not waste time with words.

19
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,412
Make camp there!

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,540
On the bank facing Red Cliff.

21
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,419
Tomorrow, we may be enemies.

22
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,171
If that day ever comes,

23
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,299
it will be each man for himself.

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,945
Cao Cao has no experience
in naval warfare.

25
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,972
He must rely on Admirals Cai Mao
and Zhang Yun.

26
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,431
If I can eliminate them,

27
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,185
his navy will be powerless.

28
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,391
Nice play!

29
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,403
Goal!

30
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,240
These little monkeys
are getting quicker!

31
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,366
The Prime Minister's
order to practice Cuju

32
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,704
has toughened these kids up.

33
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,461
Follow closely.

34
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,656
- Carry him inside quickly.
- Follow me.

35
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,168
Just my stomach growling.

36
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,007
<i>- Yes!
- Goal!</i>

37
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,182
What do you think?
Not bad, right?

38
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,692
Block him!

39
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,062
Yeah!

40
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,911
Yeah!

41
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,066
That pot isn't wide enough.

42
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,776
You would miss no matter
how wide it was.

43
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:45,947
Pitch pot is a game for aristocrats...

44
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:49,784
not for soldiers in wartime.

45
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,624
Your Honor, how'd you
throw that bull's eye?

46
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,918
Concentration.
When the enemy is over-confident,

47
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,045
we must double
our concentration.

48
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,591
With concentration,
you can kill a giant with a pebble.

49
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,637
Your Highness,
Zhou Yu's army is small.

50
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,307
He'll have to resort to guerrilla warfare.

51
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,809
That last puny victory

52
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,726
has made Zhou Yu cocky.

53
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,812
He's no guerrilla warrior.

54
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,899
He will confront us face to face.

55
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,237
They are readying for battle.

56
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,781
We need a strategy
to counter them.

57
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,827
Cao Cao wants to surround us

58
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,788
without breaking
the basic rules of strategy.

59
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,081
The first army to the field
will be rested.

60
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,877
The second army
will arrive exhausted.

61
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,643
Attack where the enemy
is least prepared.

62
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,021
Strike where they least expect it.

63
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,673
We must concentrate all forces

64
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,800
on their strongest position.

65
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,514
Naval victory depends on

66
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,060
Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun.

67
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,562
We are loyal to
Your Highness until death.

68
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,603
Cao Cao underestimates us.

69
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,442
He will never expect us
to hit their navy.

70
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,327
What is your name?

71
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,454
Private Sun Shucai.

72
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,540
You are an outstanding player

73
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,168
and a good soldier.

74
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,170
From this day forward,

75
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,757
you are promoted
to battalion commander.

76
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,382
Thank you, Your Highness!

77
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,677
Everyone must
practice hard at Cuju.

78
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,597
Only with tough bodies
can we win this war.

79
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,268
Once the Southlands
are subdued,

80
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:43,023
your families will be exempt
from taxes for three years.

81
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,400
Thank you, Your Highness!

82
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,770
What are you doing?

83
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,982
I'm... setting these
birds free.

84
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,443
That's very kind of you.

85
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,788
You're leaving?

86
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,585
Judging by your accent,
I'll bet you're a Southerner.

87
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,463
- That's right.
- Southerners are warm-hearted people.

88
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,831
Northerners are free-spirited.

89
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,426
I'm kind of dumb.

90
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,635
My whole life,
people have said...

91
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,972
You're not dumb,
just too honest.

92
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,062
You're good at Cuju.

93
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,481
Thanks for heading the ball.

94
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,525
What's your name?

95
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,110
My name is...

96
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,072
Look at the size of me.

97
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,991
My mother calls me "Piggy."

98
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,161
Piggy?

99
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,538
So you can play Cuju right?

100
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,792
You kidding?
I only know hacky-sack.

101
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,711
Congratulations on your promotion.

102
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,298
So does a commander get bigger meals?

103
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,674
You're a big officer now.

104
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,927
You can eat as much as you want.

105
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,389
Are you fighting just to fill your stomach?

106
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,350
Mother says my stomach
is a bottomless pit.

107
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,436
My family's too poor to feed me.

108
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,438
We're Pit and Piggy!

109
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,815
What a pair!

110
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,903
The new environment
has made our men ill.

111
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,405
They are weak from a long war

112
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,200
and have lost all immunity.

113
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,409
So typhoid quickly...

114
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,120
Can it be cured?

115
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,538
Yes,

116
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,706
but not overnight.

117
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,217
How many have died?

118
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,177
Over a hundred.

119
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,013
In a few days, it will be out of control.

120
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,557
We must bury them right away.

121
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,267
No burials! We must cremate.

122
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,062
Cremation is the only
way to stop its spread.

123
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,065
Ready the funeral pyres.

124
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,857
Hold on.

125
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,203
"Epidemic outbreak"

126
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,625
The climate has weakened
Cao Cao's army.

127
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,961
<i>- Disease is rampant.
- Great.</i>

128
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:55,048
Your Honor,
let's seize this chance and attack.

129
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,841
The navy is still healthy.

130
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,087
We must not act recklessly.

131
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,220
Your Honor, this is the time to attack!

132
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,388
Yes!

133
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,224
This is a battle of honor.

134
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,727
Even war must be fair.

135
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,051
Your Highness,

136
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,264
isn't this a bit inhumane?

137
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,725
Cast off the soldiers of the dead!

138
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,004
What's the matter?

139
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,442
Pull the boats here.

140
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,988
Look, what is that?

141
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,155
Pull it here.

142
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,912
Pull the boats here.

143
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,831
<i>- They're all dead.
- They were enemy soldiers.</i>

144
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,042
- Go report this to the general.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,155
Pile weapons and armor here.

146
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,325
Put the corpses there.

147
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,081
Get away from here!

148
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,889
Don't touch them!

149
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,100
They died from typhoid!

150
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,394
Move! It's contagious!

151
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,730
Move! Don't touch anything!

152
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,188
Get out of here!

153
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,399
Everyone must leave!

154
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,068
Escort these people away.

155
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,863
This is for your own good.

156
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,240
This place is infected.
Leave here immediately!

157
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,264
Cao Cao truly is ruthless.

158
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,184
Those soldiers have touched corpses.

159
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,104
I've quarantined them
so they do not infect others.

160
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,107
And the villagers?

161
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,485
I fear many have already been infected.

162
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,947
Cao Cao has stooped to evil tricks.

163
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,576
This is psychological warfare.
He's attacking our morale.

164
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,624
How do we dispose of the bodies?

165
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,461
These are the bodies of our enemies.
Feed them to the fishes.

166
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,047
No, we must lay them to rest.

167
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,299
No burials.
We must cremate them.

168
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,934
I lift my drink and sing a song

169
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,105
For who knows if life be short or long

170
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,607
Man's life is but the morning dew

171
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,362
Past days many, future ones few

172
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,906
The melancholy my heart begets

173
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,326
Comes from cares I cannot forget

174
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,078
Who can unravel these woes of mine?

175
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,583
I know but one man... the God of Wine!

176
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,502
Disciples dressed in blue

177
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,338
My heart worries for you

178
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,467
You are the cause

179
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,594
Of this song without pause

180
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,512
Across the bank, a deer bleats

181
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,848
In the wilds where it eats

182
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,269
Honored guests I salute

183
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,730
Strike the harp! Play the flute!

184
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,613
Bright is the moon's spark

185
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,241
Never ceasing, never dark

186
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,288
Thoughts of you from deep inside

187
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,791
Cannot settle, cannot subside

188
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,336
Stars around the moon are few

189
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,421
Southward the crows flew

190
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,423
Flying with no rest

191
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,009
Where shall they nest?

192
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,469
No mountain too steep

193
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,846
No ocean too deep

194
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,765
Sages rush when guests call

195
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,642
So at their feet...

196
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,063
The empire does fall!

197
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,669
Take your time. Careful, it's hot.

198
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,176
More fall sick every day.
You have enough medicine?

199
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,929
Cassia trees are scarce here.

200
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,932
Our men will keep searching.

201
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,228
Can cassia cure typhoid?

202
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,814
It will ease current symptoms.

203
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,025
But a true cure
requires other ingredients.

204
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,126
Let me take a look.

205
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,604
Hurry! Carry our men out!

206
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,689
Move it!

207
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,398
Stand up, let's go.

208
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,277
Stop! What do you think
you're doing?

209
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,029
General, what are you doing?

210
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,449
These patients cannot be moved.

211
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,076
Hurry! Put our men on the horses.

212
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,578
Please, these men must not leave.

213
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,413
They are still ill.

214
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,585
You're leaving?

215
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:23,138
Viceroy, this epidemic
is beyond our control.

216
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,267
I have barely 20,000 men.

217
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,061
If this continues,
I might lose everything.

218
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,981
I must retreat
and reformulate my strategy.

219
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,986
You withdraw at a moment like this?

220
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,614
You proposed this alliance.

221
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,282
Now, with our lives at stake, you flee?

222
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,617
This is betrayal.

223
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,744
You can't say that.

224
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,204
We are men of our word.

225
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,874
But look what has happened to our men!

226
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,085
So our men count for nothing?

227
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,005
<i>- Selfishness.
- Who is selfish?</i>

228
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,382
- Zhang Fei!
- General!

229
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,055
My Lord, the battle is set.
How can you...

230
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,597
Zhu-ge Liang.

231
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,688
I have seen over a decade of defeat.

232
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,440
I cannot endure another setback.

233
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,945
Even soldiers must obey
the law of survival.

234
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,073
We must not lose our allies' trust.

235
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,409
I know you feel strongly.

236
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,953
But in chaotic times,
you cannot live on justice alone.

237
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,499
It's time I let others fight
the tough battles.

238
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,131
One day,
you will understand this.

239
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,675
Liu Bei.

240
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,597
It was an honor
to fight alongside your men.

241
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,768
We believed in the same goal.

242
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,230
Achieving it will not be
so easy after all.

243
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,273
Take care.

244
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,651
Take care.

245
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,333
We shall meet again.

246
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,634
Aren't you leaving?

247
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
A man must honor his promises.

248
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,893
If I start something, I see it to the end.

249
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,230
Anyone who talks like that is insane.

250
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,900
Then we are all insane.

251
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,588
Your Highness, tea is ready.

252
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,391
Brother, scouts report
that the typhoid was successful.

253
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,060
<i>- The Southlands are in chaos.
- Good.</i>

254
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,355
One more thing.
Liu Bei has left with all his men.

255
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,527
<i>- Good.
- Their alliance is broken.</i>

256
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,946
Excellent

257
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,255
"Swift as the wind.

258
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,346
Gentle as a forest.

259
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,611
Fierce as fire.

260
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,039
Firm as a mountain."

261
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,843
If you hate war,

262
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,929
why can you quote "The Art of War"?

263
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,138
To understand you,

264
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:18,558
I must sneak glances at your books.

265
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,769
A thousand books

266
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,980
cannot equal a cup of your tea.

267
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,400
I'm happy so long
as YOU enjoy it.

268
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,739
I wish we could
invite Cao Cao for tea,

269
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,076
forget the war
and just enjoy the scenery.

270
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,993
Wouldn't that be great?

271
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,998
I doubt he appreciates the art of tea.

272
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,252
You wield your sword

273
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,547
like you know a way to beat Cao Cao.

274
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,092
A way as mysterious as darkness.

275
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,927
And as powerful as thunder.

276
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,767
It is time for us to act.

277
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,367
Greetings, Your Highness.

278
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:20,621
How goes the naval training, Admirals?

279
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,457
Very well, Your Highness.

280
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:27,044
We're using iron beams
to join the fleet.

281
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,462
Our men are Northerners
and new to naval battle.

282
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,509
Now our ships shall be stable
as solid ground.

283
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,429
Not even a storm
will make our men seasick.

284
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:39,598
- Can they be separated?
- Of course.

285
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,977
Men, separate the ships!

286
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,325
Unlocking the iron beams
separates the ships.

287
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,078
The fleet will move into the pincer
formation, ready for battle.

288
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,832
You truly are naval experts

289
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,626
- to invent this tactic.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

290
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,212
<i>- Jiang Gan.
- At your service, Your Highness.</i>

291
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,840
You grew up with Zhou Yu, right?

292
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,760
Yes, we were childhood friends.

293
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,512
Cross the river.
Urge him to surrender.

294
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,515
Surrender?

295
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,352
Zhou Yu's loyalty
to Sun Quan runs deep.

296
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,020
- I'm afraid he won't...
- The Southlands are falling apart.

297
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,105
Liu Bei has fled.

298
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,358
Now is the time
to ask Zhou Yu to surrender.

299
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,027
Yes, Your Highness.

300
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,471
Piggy?
Scared you, didn't I?

301
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,233
These guys keep tailing me.
How can I have any fun like this?

302
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,696
You're battalion commander.

303
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,031
They have to follow you.

304
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,329
Listen up!
Everyone go practice Cuju.

305
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,998
Yes, sir!

306
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,672
It worked!

307
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,258
- Let's have some fun!
- Great.

308
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,511
What should we play?

309
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,471
Let's play

310
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,142
- Let's play Ride High.
- Okay.

311
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,393
Come on.

312
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,855
You really are heavy.

313
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,773
Your mother gave you
the right nickname.

314
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,028
This isn't high enough.
Let's go up there.

315
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,364
Watch your balance.

316
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,241
Be careful.

317
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,161
This high enough for you?

318
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,913
Yeah.
Stay still.

319
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,089
- That itches.
- Itches?

320
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,551
Here, let me scratch it.

321
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,636
Much better.

322
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,433
Turn left.

323
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,327
What's so interesting there?
It's just the fleet.

324
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,604
Don't move.

325
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:37,942
My Lord.

326
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,905
Cao Cao has several
hundred thousand soldiers.

327
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,407
We have only 30,000.

328
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,993
We are totally outnumbered.

329
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,622
How can we fight like this?

330
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,665
This will decide the fate
of the Southlands.

331
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,752
We must fight,
even if we cannot win.

332
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,917
How many arrows do we have?

333
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,342
Not even 50,000.

334
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,428
Liu Bei took 40,000 when he fled.

335
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,016
Without those arrows,
we cannot fight.

336
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,269
The arrows are my responsibility.

337
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,190
As well they should be.
Your Lord took them.

338
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,733
We need 100,000 arrows.

339
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,903
You still think you can handle it?

340
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,782
Fine. If I cannot come up
with 100,000 arrows,

341
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,785
you may take my head.

342
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,829
We only have food for 10 days.

343
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,414
I give you 10 days' time.

344
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,001
I don't need 10, just three.

345
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,547
We soldiers do not joke.

346
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,593
You said you'd eliminate
Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun.

347
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,846
If not, then what?

348
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,182
You may have my head.

349
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:07,575
By night, the Milky Way.
By day, snaking clouds.

350
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,417
You were here all night.

351
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:19,795
What are you up to?

352
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,672
See for yourself.

353
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,840
Wind and water converge here.

354
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,467
The feng shui is excellent.

355
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,010
I'm glad you're relaxed.

356
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,596
You are worrying me to death.

357
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,598
The 20 ships with crew you requested

358
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,933
are ready.

359
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,442
There's only one day left.

360
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,734
Where are the arrows?

361
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,319
You haven't made even one!

362
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,113
You should be in a nervous sweat.

363
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,031
My sweat is of no concern.

364
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,951
But see if the tortoise is sweating.

365
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,622
It is.

366
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:59,417
As I predicted, fog is coming.

367
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,836
What fog?

368
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,712
The only fog here is around my head.

369
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,340
What is this plan of yours?

370
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,885
Nature's secrets cannot be revealed.

371
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:15,683
Old cow plows the paddy's rows

372
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:20,689
Young calf munches on what grows

373
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,691
You really are something.

374
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,278
Back then, you were just a kid
who loved to sing.

375
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,824
Who'd have guessed that kid
would be a Viceroy?

376
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:36,622
Planting rice
is the old man's chore

377
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,209
We were 10 when you clubbed
that bandit from behind.

378
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,295
He spun around and somehow
the club was in my hands.

379
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,465
He gave me the beating of my life.

380
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,595
In the sedan chair,
the young boy snores

381
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,892
To this day I still don't understand

382
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,019
how that club got into my hand.

383
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,605
You're too slow.

384
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,863
You remember that time...

385
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,616
I wrote on the tutor's exam book
in your handwriting,

386
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,244
"senile bastard"!

387
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,704
That's right!

388
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,333
He gave me 20 swats
across my backside.

389
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,751
Back in those days,

390
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,753
there was no prank we didn't pull.

391
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,132
I can trick any man I meet.

392
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:32,344
But with you,
I always play the fool.

393
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,556
Bring my sword!

394
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,730
Marvelous!

395
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,260
You are a fine sword dancer.

396
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,565
Are you here as Cao Cao's emissary?

397
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,108
Me?

398
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,195
I can barely speak for myself.

399
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,820
How could I speak for Cao Cao?

400
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,864
I'm not as clever as you,

401
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,534
but I know what song you're singing.

402
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,286
You do not give me enough credit.

403
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,329
I'd never disrespect a talented Southerner,

404
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,498
but to serve Cao Cao is wrong.

405
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,210
You have your Lord
and I have mine, but...

406
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,710
No matter.

407
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,420
A few days from now

408
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,257
someone will lay Cao Cao's head
at my feet.

409
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,884
You believe me?

410
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,552
Yes, I do.

411
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,514
Your Honor, urgent news!

412
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,141
Can't you see I have a guest?

413
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,489
I know we've no arrows.

414
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,367
If Zhu-ge Liang fails to get more,
I'll have his head.

415
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,077
Maybe our friends
across the river can help.

416
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,996
They have a more
important mission.

417
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,041
Admirals Cai Mao
and Zhang Yun report that

418
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,001
Cao Cao's head
cannot be taken just yet.

419
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,210
I fear...

420
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,711
Do not underestimate them.

421
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,132
Here is their message.

422
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,012
Excellent!

423
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,516
Mr. Jiang.

424
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:46,144
What are you doing here alone?

425
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,311
Mrs. Zhou?

426
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,730
Come sit inside.

427
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,233
Xiao Qiao, bring more wine.

428
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,110
Any more and you'll be drunk.

429
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,155
Come on, we'll drink more upstairs.

430
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,324
- Drink more?
- Why end a good time?

431
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:07,081
I hear Cao Cao invaded
the Southlands all for your wife.

432
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,001
Is that so?

433
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,170
Cao Cao has a reputation
for stealing men's wives.

434
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,007
You're drunk.

435
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,719
- More wine.
- More? Where?

436
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,597
"We surrendered to Cao Cao

437
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,768
not for profit
but out of desperation.

438
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,646
We now have the Northerners
entrapped in camp.

439
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:17,110
Soon we will deliver his decap...

440
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,945
...his decapitated head.

441
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,282
Further reports to come.

442
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,449
Admiral Cai Mao"

443
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,869
What are you looking at?

444
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,289
Just one of my tricks.

445
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,253
You do love to play tricks on me.

446
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,090
I'll trick you again...

447
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,927
and again...

448
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:50,226
Not this time you won't.

449
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,293
Scarecrow, you're more
of a man than that fellow.

450
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,253
That fellow
doesn't tell me a thing.

451
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,965
You're a better drinking buddy.

452
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,382
Cheers!

453
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,400
Scarecrow...

454
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,695
why are we heading
for the enemy camp?

455
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,032
You're not surrendering are you?

456
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:43,547
The enemy!
The enemy is approaching!

457
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,094
Separate ships.

458
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,057
Send the left flank
to intercept the enemy.

459
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,112
Faster!

460
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,081
Scarecrow, stop drumming.

461
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,833
What if Cao Cao's men come for us?

462
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,253
They wouldn't dare.
A heavy fog might hide an ambush.

463
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,257
Oh, so you've decided to talk to me?

464
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,724
Ready all archers.

465
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,059
Shoot at first sight.

466
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,023
Ready!

467
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,235
All ships line up!

468
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:18,143
This is a plot to turn us
against each other.

469
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,148
We're not fools.

470
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:27,277
Would Zhou Yu use
such an obvious trick?

471
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,155
Sometimes the simplest trick

472
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,449
is the best way to lead
someone to their death.

473
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,956
Shoot

474
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,516
Shoot!

475
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,293
Your Highness,
whether this is a trick or not,

476
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,630
we should proceed with caution.

477
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,632
What if their navy mutinies?

478
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,552
That would be a disaster.

479
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,262
Shoot!

480
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,891
Besides the letter,

481
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,269
I heard them mention

482
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,896
that friends here
would get them arrows.

483
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,096
Don't worry.

484
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,556
Scarecrow will protect you.

485
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,902
Cease drumming!

486
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,413
Call Admirals Cai Mao
and Zhang Yun in for questioning.

487
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,541
They are out training the fleet.

488
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:50,586
If they are not here,
then their handwriting is.

489
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,005
Bring their letter of surrender.

490
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,800
Ready, all ships about-face!

491
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,177
What?

492
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,445
Drum in unison.

493
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,822
Give them a target to shoot.

494
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,039
Aim for the drums.

495
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,623
Shoot

496
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,463
Drink up.

497
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,344
Watch your seat.

498
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,226
Fire at will!

499
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,206
The handwriting is a perfect match

500
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,501
and full of the same mistakes.

501
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,755
This must be the work of Cai Mao.

502
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,882
Shoot!

503
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:43,532
We return home victorious!

504
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,201
Cheers!

505
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,974
Nothing but scared mice.
Return to your positions!

506
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,101
Return to your positions!

507
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,648
Thank you, Prime Minister, for your gift.

508
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,652
Thank you! Thank you!

509
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,306
Marvelous!

510
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,599
Mr. Zhu-gel

511
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,768
Look!

512
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,021
How did you know the fog was coming?

513
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,648
A clear Milky Way and snaking clouds

514
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,858
signal fog is near.

515
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,070
If you know how earth, sky,
yin and yang change,

516
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:04,197
then the sun, moon and stars,

517
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:06,532
the wind, forest,
mountains and fire,

518
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,909
all become soldiers
at your command.

519
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,996
So you can read
Mother Nature's moods, huh?

520
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,498
We lost one!

521
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,710
<i>- What a shame.
- Hey, come back!</i>

522
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,172
A small victory hardly deserves
such a reception Your Highness.

523
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,632
A small victory?

524
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,594
How many men did the enemy send?

525
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,971
Fog covered the river.
Impossible to see.

526
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,639
If you could not see,
how did you repel them?

527
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,266
Firing at will forced retreat.

528
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:15,643
Firing at will?

529
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,771
- How many arrows is that?
- About 100,000.

530
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,190
About 100,000.

531
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,610
And why didn't you pursue them?

532
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,487
Fog meant possible ambush,
Your Highness.

533
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,822
So...

534
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,990
Again with the fog.

535
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:35,954
Seems like you are hiding
something in that fog.

536
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:41,126
Look, a boat is floating this way.
Pull it in!

537
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,282
Your Highness.

538
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:15,369
Can't you tell a soldier
from a scarecrow?

539
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,331
100,000 arrows?

540
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,541
You're mighty generous.

541
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,394
- Please forgive me, Your Highness.
- I deserve death, Your Highness.

542
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,338
Today it's arrows.

543
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:29,509
Tomorrow it's my head,
am I right?

544
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,893
Zhou Yu is turning us
against each other.

545
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,646
No spy is stupid enough to...

546
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,731
Silence!

547
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,485
I trust and honor talented men,

548
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:53,490
but I abhor deceivers and traitors.

549
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,659
Guards!

550
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,161
Your Highness, we have
trained day and night.

551
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,164
Take them away and behead them.

552
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,208
We swear our loyalty to Your Highness.

553
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,795
Didn't I surrender to a benevolent ruler?

554
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,146
We have trained night and day.

555
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,255
Wait, Your Highness.

556
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,467
If you kill them, who will lead the navy?

557
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,219
Halt!

558
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,063
Ninety-three thousand,
eight hundred...

559
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,440
Ninety-four thousand...

560
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,860
Ninety-four thousand, two hundred...

561
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,195
Ninety-four thousand, six hundred...

562
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,157
We'll shoot Cao Cao with his own arrows.

563
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,909
This battle will be interesting.

564
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,123
Concentrate! No mistakes.

565
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,916
Wait.

566
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,710
Don't interrupt.

567
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,755
Two hundred per person.
There'll be no mistakes.

568
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,882
Mr. Zhu-ge, what is this new invention?

569
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,050
A rapid-fire crossbow.

570
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,219
It shoots 10 arrows without reloading.

571
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,012
Here, watch.

572
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,347
Great.

573
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:00,141
Ninety-nine thousand, four hundred...

574
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,101
Ninety-nine thousand, six hundred...

575
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,195
Impressive!

576
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,864
You know a trifle
about weapons design too.

577
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,451
Knowing a trifle about everything
gives life more color.

578
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,079
Your Honor.

579
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,289
Did he reach 100,000?

580
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:27,085
The total is 99,600.

581
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,463
Now what?

582
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,298
Well...

583
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:38,471
Your Honor, it's only 400.

584
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,681
Short one is still short.

585
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,307
The law is firm as a mountain.

586
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,894
That's right.
So what does the law say?

587
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,652
The law prescribes beheading.

588
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,195
Bastards!

589
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,780
What took you so long?

590
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,490
Hurry and bring them over.

591
00:51:58,657 --> 00:51:59,826
Thank God!

592
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,452
The total is 100,200.

593
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,121
Mr. Zhu-ge has completed his mission.

594
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,833
Seems like my head is safe where it is.

595
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,168
How about yours?

596
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:14,422
You want my head?

597
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:18,635
Mr. Zhu-ge.
We're just joking.

598
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,639
When I lost, was he joking?

599
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,141
Of course not.

600
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,710
Looks like you haven't lost after all.

601
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,880
Cao Cao has executed
Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun.

602
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:05,224
I think we've been duped.

603
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,518
Steal the enemy's weapons,
then destroy their morale.

604
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,690
Your strategies
worked together brilliantly.

605
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,193
Cao Cao must be going crazy
right about now.

606
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,280
In two or three days,
he will try something desperate.

607
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,824
But this will not be good for Jiang Gan.

608
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,661
I've lost an old friend.

609
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,416
Honored guests.

610
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,753
Zhou Yu is just showing
off his cleverness.

611
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,505
He undoubtedly thinks
I have gone crazy.

612
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,340
Tell me, do I look crazy?

613
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,509
Not at all.

614
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,304
Come, let us root out the traitor.

615
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:46,724
Then we can sleep easy. Cheers!

616
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,061
- Jiang Gan.
- Yes.

617
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,188
Today, you were of great service.

618
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,398
Please drink.

619
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,574
Thank you, Your Highness.

620
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,378
Sir!

621
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:23,469
Sir! Are you...

622
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,393
Your stupidity was trivial.

623
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,478
But you brought
your stupidity upon me.

624
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,610
Hear this!

625
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,447
In two days, our army shall cross the river

626
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,699
and take Red Cliff!

627
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,574
Yes, Your Highness!

628
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:58,670
All hear this! In two days,
the army will cross the river.

629
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,313
What's going on here?

630
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,985
There's a spy! Catch the spy!

631
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,327
Halt!

632
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,626
Don't let him escape!

633
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,211
Grab him!

634
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,902
Piggy, why do they want to hurt you?

635
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,070
It's a misunderstanding.

636
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,905
A misunderstanding?

637
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,155
What's going on?

638
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,365
He's a SPY-

639
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,949
Nonsense, he is my friend.

640
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,536
Friend? Are you stupid?

641
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,581
Come on, they're beating up
the commander.

642
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:17,708
A fight!

643
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,094
<i>- What is the fight all about?
- Nothing, just some roughhousing.</i>

644
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,860
Pit!

645
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,405
Pit!

646
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,079
Piggy, are you all right?

647
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:01,918
I have to go.

648
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,677
Piggy-

649
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,554
Where are you going?

650
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,597
My mother is sick.
I must go home.

651
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:18,268
That's very kind of you to visit her.

652
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,150
You should go home too.

653
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,485
No, I'll return after the war.

654
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:27,777
Fighting means no taxes.

655
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,780
That means more food on the table.

656
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,115
Hurry, go visit your mother!

657
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:41,291
I will come back to see you.

658
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,342
Ride high.

659
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,440
Don't let him escape!

660
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,025
He's just going to see his mother.

661
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,041
Hit him! Pummel him!

662
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:25,878
In 18 years of battle

663
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:28,380
I have never lost.

664
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:31,467
If I fail to capture this tiny cliff,

665
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,677
I shudder to think what
historians will say.

666
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,346
Yes.

667
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,394
Your Highness.

668
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:57,701
How are things?

669
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,871
Worse than expected.

670
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,666
The disease's spread has not slowed.

671
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,043
At this rate,

672
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,255
it will take a month to control.

673
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:17,054
I respectfully request
you delay the assault.

674
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,025
Stop! Lie still.

675
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,527
- Your Highness
- Sit up.

676
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:35,947
You are ill and must recuperate.

677
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:41,619
Man Tun, how can you be ill?

678
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,914
You were always in perfect health.

679
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,961
What is on your mind?
Go ahead.

680
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,255
I want to go home.

681
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:58,094
I too have not been home
for a long time.

682
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:01,431
I want to see my youngest son.

683
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,730
He is only 13 years old...

684
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,650
Younger than you even.

685
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:16,322
He is kind-hearted and bright.

686
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:22,077
He has been frail since birth
and is often sick.

687
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,579
Yet, in front of me,

688
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,458
he pretends everything is fine.

689
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,547
Whatever the illness, he endures.

690
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,507
He never complains to me.

691
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:02,034
I swore at the start of this war

692
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:07,206
to cleanse the world of warlords.

693
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,715
We must seize Red Cliff
and storm the capital,

694
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:23,222
then bring the mud
of this land back home

695
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,726
and tell our families
we were victorious.

696
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,856
We were victorious!

697
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:40,030
So you all must be strong,

698
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,411
as must I.

699
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:51,833
Because I must
bring you back home.

700
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:44,335
Victory!

701
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:55,748
Greetings, everyone.

702
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,210
- Sorry for the wait.
- We're glad you're back safely.

703
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:01,713
- Did you have any problems?
- No.

704
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,675
I just fell into the mud
jumping the stockade.

705
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,760
Shang Xiang.

706
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:09,961
You're always causing trouble.

707
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,974
Where have you been?

708
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,231
They are ready to attack.

709
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:21,483
Shang Xiang.

710
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:22,943
You're back.

711
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,527
Xiao Qiao.

712
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,701
Shang Xiang?

713
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:44,088
Xiao Qiao.

714
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,673
Please help me pull this.

715
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,092
Go ahead, pull it.

716
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,498
This is a map of Cao Cao's camp.

717
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,043
This tower here

718
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,793
is Cao Cao's headquarters.

719
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,047
Their best troops guard it.

720
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,840
The barracks are here.

721
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,675
East and west are well-defended.

722
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,469
The rear hill is weakest.

723
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,722
It's like a tiger that stares ahead,
but forgets its tail.

724
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,306
- The navy is here?
- Put this on.

725
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:36,994
<i>- You'll catch a chill.
- I'm not cold.</i>

726
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:40,103
A third of their forces
are on board ready for assault.

727
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,481
Warships lead the smaller boats.

728
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,358
Transport ships are in the middle.

729
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,985
This is an interlocked naval formation.
I'm fine.

730
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,905
Every ship is ready for attack or defense.

731
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,010
I was wrong to scold you.

732
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,018
If you were Zhou Yu,

733
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:24,356
how would you attack?

734
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:26,608
He only has enough men for one assault-

735
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:29,735
an all-out attack on our fleet.

736
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:32,780
They will want to attack with fire.

737
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,782
Fire? I doubt it.

738
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,702
Without manpower, they need strength.

739
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:40,539
Where can they get it? Fire, of course.

740
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,666
This is a standard rule of war.

741
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:45,418
Too bad it won't work.

742
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,920
A northwest wind is blowing.

743
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,882
If they attack our fleet with fire,

744
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:56,887
they will be fighting the wind
and burn themselves.

745
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,599
We are the ones who should use fire.

746
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,311
Yes, load the ships with brimstone.

747
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:08,567
Tomorrow, we shall burn Red Cliff
to the ground!

748
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,492
The map shows

749
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:19,911
that Cao Cao's army
has finished deployment.

750
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:24,416
Tonight may be the decisive battle.

751
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,335
This is a fight to the death.

752
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:33,257
Win or lose, we must fight
with everything we have.

753
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,606
Shang Xiang.

754
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,858
What are these lines between the ships?

755
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:51,400
It sounds funny.

756
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,739
They've locked their boats together
to stabilize the fleet,

757
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,159
so the Northerners won't get seasick.

758
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:02,411
Enough talk.
What is your strategy?

759
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,797
Cao Cao made camp
in a bad location.

760
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,465
It is hook-shaped.

761
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,926
This makes return difficult.

762
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:20,055
If their assault fails,
they cannot fall back.

763
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,932
We should use fire.

764
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,185
The terrain is in our favor.

765
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,270
If we can burn the fleet's vanguard,

766
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,065
they will be trapped and vulnerable.

767
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:33,484
Yes, a fire attack!

768
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:37,363
Just give me 10 fire ships.

769
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,324
Two will hit their left and right flanks.

770
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:45,037
The remaining eight will ram the center.

771
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,914
We'll burn an opening here!

772
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:49,583
Next, you follow closely and rush in.

773
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,712
No matter how great their numbers,

774
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,631
we will crush them.

775
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,889
If only we still had Liu Bei's cavalry,

776
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:05,975
we could attack their camp at the rear.

777
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:09,354
Then victory would be assured.

778
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:25,953
This wind is to Cao Cao's advantage.

779
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,082
A northwest wind is blowing.

780
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,458
Sailing into the wind
will burn our own fleet.

781
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,003
Cao Cao knows the wind is on his side.

782
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,965
He will also think of using fire.

783
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:06,286
Why are you so quiet?

784
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:08,496
What are you looking at?

785
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,498
Look, those dark clouds in the east

786
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,543
are enshrouding the sun.

787
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,546
Isn't that rather unusual?

788
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,257
Zhu-ge Liang, what does that mean?

789
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,719
The winds will change.

790
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,224
I know from farming,

791
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:31,310
if, during a warm winter,
clouds enshroud the sun

792
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:34,064
then along the Yangtze River

793
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,390
an unseasonal wind will blow.

794
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:37,274
What do you mean unseasonal?

795
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,109
A warm southeast wind.

796
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:43,448
It blows from southeast to northwest.

797
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,283
What if Cao Cao knows this too?

798
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:50,412
Only Admiral Cai Mao
would know and he is dead.

799
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:57,087
Zhu-ge Liang.

800
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,880
Can you predict when it will change?

801
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,507
Tonight or tomorrow morning.

802
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:04,511
History shows the timing of weather is key.

803
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,971
He who can predict it will win.

804
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,648
We must delay his attack.

805
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,149
Only then will we have a chance at victory.

806
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,260
Greetings, General.

807
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,434
Terrific, just terrific!

808
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,810
This fish oil is perfect!

809
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,841
<i>- Bigger.
- Yes, General!</i>

810
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:38,896
No good. Bigger!

811
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:40,731
Yes, General.

812
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:52,452
No good. Bigger!

813
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,496
Just how big do you want it?

814
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:56,997
Go!

815
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,432
That's about right.

816
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,854
Yes! This is it!

817
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:33,158
See how strong this west wind is?

818
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,953
It will never shift.

819
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,081
We'll never get near their navy.

820
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,835
Your Honor, I can fake a defection.

821
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,461
Invent some excuse

822
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:45,421
to punish me with 50 lashes.

823
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,423
I'll fake a surrender in anger.

824
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,592
That way Cao Cao is sure to believe me.

825
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,596
Then I can sail my fire ships in range.

826
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,891
How could you fight after such a beating?

827
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:02,313
I could never treat a general that way.

828
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,440
Do not lose heart.

829
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,774
The east wind will come.

830
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,444
Your Honor.

831
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,570
Terrible news!

832
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:13,158
Our Lady has disappeared!

833
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:39,809
My dear husband,
by the time you read this

834
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:44,439
I will be on the way to Cao Cao's camp.

835
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,609
I will be cautious,

836
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:51,320
and only act when the moment is right.

837
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,240
Yet, I hope the east wind will come early.

838
01:14:55,408 --> 01:15:00,037
Where there is faith, there is hope.

839
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,127
The clear waters of the Yangtze,

840
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:09,046
the emerald leaves of the mountains,

841
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,757
the birds returning to nest,

842
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:14,719
the fisherman singing his evening song.

843
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,180
This is our home,

844
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,975
our beautiful native land.

845
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:26,064
Our people gladly
give their lives for her sake.

846
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,984
I cannot stand idly by.

847
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:56,636
I have been carrying our child Ping An
for three months.

848
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,389
I did not tell you,

849
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,100
fearing it might distract you.

850
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:08,480
We cannot, in caring for our child,

851
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:12,402
forget the children of the Southlands.

852
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:15,863
I want to see them grow up together,

853
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:19,908
to have a future where they can play,

854
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,746
swim, pick flowers

855
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:27,500
and plant rice in peace.

856
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,127
"Your child Ping An"

857
01:16:30,295 --> 01:16:33,715
"Pregnant"

858
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:37,135
Do not fear.

859
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,887
I shall bring Ping An home.

860
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:21,762
Some traditions
still carry great meaning.

861
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:24,765
For example,
rice flour and sugar

862
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:29,395
stick together
like a family at reunion.

863
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:40,030
Over here!
Bring the cart here!

864
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:43,868
There are sweet
rice dumplings for everyone.

865
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,537
Today is winter solstice,
a time for reunion.

866
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:49,498
Everyone have some rice dumplings.

867
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:53,211
Two or three per person! Eat up!

868
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,546
Officers and soldiers alike, come on.

869
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:59,466
Two or three per person! Eat up!

870
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:02,220
Come on.

871
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,554
Give me a bowl.

872
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,738
Zhang Fei,
you're making them too big.

873
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:24,074
Do you want us to choke?

874
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:27,744
Fine with me.
I couldn't be happier.

875
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:36,314
Zhao Yun.

876
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,983
Has your wound healed
from combat practice?

877
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:43,654
So long as I can fight,
a wound means nothing.

878
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,630
Guan Yu, how many times
have you read the classics?

879
01:20:01,631 --> 01:20:04,591
If a man of learning
does not understand brotherhood,

880
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,844
isn't his learning worthless?

881
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,662
My Lord, what are we doing here?

882
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,704
Waiting.

883
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,707
Waiting for what?

884
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,793
Waiting for Zhu-ge Liang.

885
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,963
Waiting for his return,
so we can go home.

886
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:46,551
Do we still have a home?

887
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:50,179
Sons of the Southlands, listen.

888
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,224
Today is the winter solstice,

889
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,810
a day for family reunion.

890
01:20:56,978 --> 01:21:01,565
Yet thieves encircle our home.

891
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:04,025
How can we celebrate like this?

892
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:08,905
I say, let us drive them
from this land.

893
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:11,908
Then we shall have
our celebratory family meal.

894
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,911
Here here!

895
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,667
My Lord.

896
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,586
Though I sometimes disagree with you,

897
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:25,088
I have never said a word against you.

898
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:30,386
But this is a choice between
right and wrong.

899
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,512
I acted for the good of us all,

900
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,432
yet you lecture me
for being unrighteous.

901
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,519
You have followed me
so long and for what?

902
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:41,479
I just want to ensure we live on.

903
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:09,132
There are some things I value
more than my life.

904
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:17,451
Zhou Yu, may your plans
come to fruition.

905
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:20,704
We will fight the good fight.

906
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:44,478
Zhou Yu's wife is here.

907
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,896
She came alone.

908
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,807
Zhou Yu.

909
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:49,145
We must alter our plan of attack.

910
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,854
Consider your wife's safety.

911
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,856
I will send our best men

912
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:56,025
around back to rescue her.

913
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:58,112
No changes.

914
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:01,782
All our forces must be focused
on frontal assault.

915
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,868
We cannot divide
our strength.

916
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:08,497
Your Honor, we stand alone
on the battlefield.

917
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,039
Without allied support,

918
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:13,793
the chance for victory seems slight.

919
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:16,212
I have never given up on my dream.

920
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,591
Victory cannot rest on dreams alone.

921
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,056
When will the east wind come?

922
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:29,475
Based on new observations

923
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:31,395
at around one o'clock.

924
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,023
If at that time you still
trust your friends,

925
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:37,400
light a lantern for a signal.

926
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:43,740
If misfortune befalls Xiao Qiao,

927
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:47,368
will you still fight a war of honor?

928
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,680
I saw you once in the back
of your family's estate.

929
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:12,435
Though young, you were
already a great beauty.

930
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:14,020
You were studying
the tea ceremony

931
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:17,983
and liked catching butterflies.

932
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:38,628
Did you launch this war for me?

933
01:27:38,796 --> 01:27:40,631
You believe that?

934
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:44,801
My father was very fond of you.

935
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:47,887
At that time, Cao Cao
believed in justice, ideals

936
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,099
and loyalty to the Han throne.

937
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,643
He was a young hero.

938
01:27:53,644 --> 01:27:59,065
How else could he have become
Prime Minister?

939
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:03,529
By killing many people.

940
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:10,828
I hear many Southlands
soldiers have fallen ill.

941
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,829
Yes.

942
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:15,332
I hear Liu Bei has fled

943
01:28:15,498 --> 01:28:18,167
and the alliance is broken.

944
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:20,503
Yes.

945
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:25,551
Then Zhou Yu must be a lonely man.

946
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,516
Did he send you?

947
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:36,145
This was my idea.

948
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,858
Why are you here?

949
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:44,319
Please withdraw your troops.

950
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:46,154
Victory is yours.

951
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:48,114
What need is there to fight on?

952
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:50,283
No.

953
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:54,496
Zhou Yu shall kneel
before me in surrender.

954
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,877
What is this?

955
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,048
I am not here for my husband,

956
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:07,676
but for the people of this kingdom.

957
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:12,221
Please end this war.

958
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:15,059
And if I refuse?

959
01:29:22,565 --> 01:29:24,234
Stop playing.

960
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:35,287
You must witness
how I defeat Zhou Yu.

961
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:19,456
What's on your mind?

962
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:25,962
Just thinking of a silly friend.

963
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:44,856
The times make the hero.

964
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:18,306
After this battle,

965
01:31:18,474 --> 01:31:20,266
I will have time to savor your tea.

966
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:22,478
Just one cup?

967
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,979
It'll help you relax.

968
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,735
Fine.

969
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:38,784
No one's ever given us respect.

970
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,453
So what?

971
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:42,872
Who cares so long
as we respect ourselves?

972
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,373
Listen up!

973
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:49,712
Our boats will soon charge
Cao Cao's fleet.

974
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,550
No man jumps ship
until their ships burn.

975
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:55,219
Yes, sir!

976
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:56,677
Any problem with that?

977
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,180
No, sir!

978
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,890
That's what I thought.

979
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:03,143
Have you all written
to your families?

980
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,770
Yes.

981
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:40,430
Don't rush!

982
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:43,516
Appreciate the tea's color
and bouquet.

983
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:45,394
Oh.

984
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,270
Why is the Prime Minister
waiting to attack?

985
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:11,533
The wind is behaving strangely.

986
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,421
I know.

987
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,381
He is drinking tea
with that woman.

988
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,759
Tea?

989
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:21,596
What makes brewing tea
so difficult?

990
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:26,475
Leaves, heat, water, and utensils

991
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:29,145
all demand study.

992
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:36,444
Yet boiling water
is the most difficult.

993
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:38,154
Boiling water?

994
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:41,824
Look!

995
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:44,953
The wind has stopped.

996
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:58,759
At first boil, the bubbles hiss
and resemble tiny fish eyes.

997
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:02,345
At second boil,
the edge simmers like a fountain.

998
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:05,515
This is when tea is finest.

999
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,351
At third boil,
the water seethes and spurts.

1000
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:13,148
Any further and the water
is past its prime.

1001
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:17,360
Your Honor, the wind
seems about to shift.

1002
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:20,029
It's time to attack.
What are we waiting for?

1003
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:21,448
Our allies.

1004
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,408
What allies?

1005
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:29,664
Liu Bei fled days ago.

1006
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,208
This is all part of Zhou Yu's plan.

1007
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:36,212
Some plans are best kept quiet.

1008
01:34:39,548 --> 01:34:41,301
Enough! It is full!

1009
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:43,011
Your Highness.

1010
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:47,224
Don't you see your true self
reflected in this tea?

1011
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,559
Your heart is overflowing with ambition.

1012
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:55,690
It's too full to let other people in.

1013
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:58,819
You've carried this full heart
to Red Cliff.

1014
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:03,532
Someone here will pour
that heart onto the floor.

1015
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,342
Your Highness.

1016
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:26,595
You do not understand
the art of tea.

1017
01:35:33,185 --> 01:35:36,605
Your Honor, tell us what we must do.

1018
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:37,858
At two o'clock,

1019
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:41,110
the 10 fire ships will ram Cao Cao's fleet,

1020
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:44,072
burning through their vanguard.

1021
01:35:45,282 --> 01:35:46,365
With the fleet broken,

1022
01:35:46,533 --> 01:35:49,243
Zhao Yun will hit the east gate

1023
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:52,122
to divert their attention.

1024
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:56,792
Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei

1025
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,838
will overwhelm Cao Cao's camp
from the west gate.

1026
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:14,269
Doctor!

1027
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:17,439
Your Highness.

1028
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,149
Call Doctor Hua Tuo.
My head aches.

1029
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,319
Your Highness,
Hua Tuo has left.

1030
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:24,988
What did you say?

1031
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:27,615
Hua Tuo is gone.

1032
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:34,890
Cast off!

1033
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:47,319
What is this wind?

1034
01:37:47,487 --> 01:37:48,966
It's an easterly wind, Your Highness.

1035
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:52,074
It shifted? Impossible!

1036
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:59,582
Enemy ships approaching!

1037
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:01,417
General, enemy ships approaching!

1038
01:38:01,585 --> 01:38:02,668
Hurry, separate the ships!

1039
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:04,421
Separate ships!

1040
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:17,475
What is that?

1041
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:20,936
Those are their lanterns,
Your Highness.

1042
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,440
Forward.

1043
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:31,864
Zhou Yu.

1044
01:38:32,032 --> 01:38:34,117
I have done all I can.

1045
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:38,329
Tonight will decide the fate of the empire.

1046
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,792
There must be no mistakes.

1047
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,420
Zhu-ge Liang!

1048
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:48,131
You weren't lying after all!

1049
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,890
Report!
Boats are approaching fast.

1050
01:38:58,057 --> 01:39:01,519
<i>- Separate ships immediately.
- Separation has already begun.</i>

1051
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,699
Light the fires!

1052
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:24,667
Forward.

1053
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:36,011
Hurry over here!

1054
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:04,207
Full speed ahead!

1055
01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:51,628
Hurry, separate the ships.

1056
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:55,300
Faster.

1057
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:57,737
Retreat!
Protect the main gate!

1058
01:41:57,904 --> 01:42:03,158
Faster, toward Cao Cao's flagship!

1059
01:43:51,434 --> 01:43:54,103
Strike as powerful as thunder!

1060
01:44:29,137 --> 01:44:30,974
Charge!

1061
01:44:32,307 --> 01:44:35,019
<i>- Go ahead.
- Charge!</i>

1062
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:57,958
Follow me.

1063
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,690
Shoot!

1064
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:36,413
Launch catapults!

1065
01:45:52,387 --> 01:45:54,640
Hurry, the enemy is approaching.

1066
01:45:54,806 --> 01:45:57,060
Look, over there!

1067
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:19,748
Your Highness! Terrible news!

1068
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:21,435
They have broken through the stockade!

1069
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:23,293
Why are you panicking?

1070
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:26,421
Do not forget you are a general.

1071
01:46:26,588 --> 01:46:28,423
I...

1072
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,368
Try to endure the pain.

1073
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,305
Reinforce Zhang Fei! Move!

1074
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:21,871
Your Highness.

1075
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:24,332
The rear gate is under surprise attack.

1076
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:27,042
It is Liu Bei's allied forces.

1077
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:29,045
Liu Bei?

1078
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:32,297
Free the horses!

1079
01:48:32,465 --> 01:48:34,050
Pull!

1080
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:53,860
General Gan.
We must save energy for inside.

1081
01:48:56,655 --> 01:48:58,032
You must break down this gate

1082
01:48:58,198 --> 01:48:59,408
so we can join our allies.

1083
01:48:59,574 --> 01:49:00,868
Otherwise, all is lost.

1084
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:03,246
<i>- No problem.
- Good luck.</i>

1085
01:49:34,527 --> 01:49:36,153
Halt.

1086
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:41,158
Tear down the barricade!

1087
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:45,954
Shoot!

1088
01:50:06,725 --> 01:50:08,144
Forward.

1089
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:10,438
Attack the main gate.

1090
01:50:26,996 --> 01:50:28,497
Come on, soldier.

1091
01:50:29,914 --> 01:50:32,208
Hang in there.

1092
01:50:41,761 --> 01:50:42,761
General Gan!

1093
01:50:42,927 --> 01:50:44,512
Individual bombs
aren't strong enough.

1094
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:49,143
Run! The fire is coming!

1095
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:50,685
Give me all your fire bombs.

1096
01:50:50,853 --> 01:50:52,188
There are only three left!

1097
01:50:52,354 --> 01:50:56,067
No retreat! No surrender!

1098
01:51:11,873 --> 01:51:14,877
This is it!

1099
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:38,525
All forces attack!

1100
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:47,511
Shoot!

1101
01:54:05,338 --> 01:54:06,465
Your Highness.

1102
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:08,216
The navy is lost.

1103
01:54:08,384 --> 01:54:12,054
East, south, and west...
all three sides have been sunk.

1104
01:54:19,895 --> 01:54:24,149
It seems like
they went up in flames too.

1105
01:54:24,315 --> 01:54:26,068
Yes, Your Highness.

1106
01:54:26,234 --> 01:54:28,737
All is quiet below.

1107
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:44,252
The fire is too fierce!

1108
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:45,712
Stay together at all costs!

1109
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,591
Don't get separated!

1110
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,516
Your Highness.

1111
01:54:59,518 --> 01:55:01,436
Perhaps retreat is best.

1112
01:55:01,604 --> 01:55:03,354
Retreat?

1113
01:55:03,521 --> 01:55:05,774
With our best soldiers still remaining?

1114
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:08,484
They would give their lives for me.

1115
01:55:10,945 --> 01:55:13,532
Even if all will die, they must fight.

1116
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:15,492
This is military power.

1117
01:55:21,916 --> 01:55:25,461
All together! Charge!

1118
01:55:35,054 --> 01:55:36,387
Fight me if you dare.

1119
01:55:36,555 --> 01:55:38,140
Come back here!

1120
01:55:42,645 --> 01:55:44,063
Come on, you traitor!

1121
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:45,773
General!

1122
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:49,502
Don't give up, my brother.

1123
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:50,837
Guan Yu!

1124
01:56:51,005 --> 01:56:52,547
Where is Liu Bei?

1125
01:57:02,557 --> 01:57:04,350
Full speed ahead!

1126
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,117
Break formation!

1127
01:58:17,298 --> 01:58:19,092
Launch spears!

1128
01:58:29,478 --> 01:58:30,645
Forward!

1129
01:58:30,813 --> 01:58:34,817
Crush them or die trying!

1130
01:58:45,743 --> 01:58:47,829
Hang in there.

1131
02:00:12,247 --> 02:00:19,796
I oversaw the end of every warlord.

1132
02:00:27,179 --> 02:00:32,893
I saw the end of one here and one there...

1133
02:00:48,951 --> 02:00:52,328
The end of all but here.

1134
02:01:09,762 --> 02:01:10,972
Just in time.

1135
02:01:11,139 --> 02:01:13,100
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

1136
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:14,725
I said we would meet again.

1137
02:01:14,893 --> 02:01:17,145
Gan Xing sacrificed himself.

1138
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,314
But not in vain.

1139
02:01:22,818 --> 02:01:25,945
The fire is approaching.
We must save Xiao Qiao now!

1140
02:01:26,947 --> 02:01:28,864
First find Cao Cao.

1141
02:01:32,493 --> 02:01:35,497
We have lost

1142
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:38,500
all because
of that accursed woman.

1143
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:42,796
She ruined our chance to attack.

1144
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:45,090
- I'll kill her!
- Kill her!

1145
02:02:06,528 --> 02:02:08,738
Come no further.

1146
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:44,399
Don't let the enemy through.

1147
02:02:44,565 --> 02:02:47,569
That way, quickly!

1148
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,868
Protect the Prime Minister! Get them!

1149
02:02:55,034 --> 02:02:56,453
Pit?

1150
02:03:10,841 --> 02:03:12,094
Pit.

1151
02:03:17,349 --> 02:03:19,893
It's me, Piggy-

1152
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:23,604
It's me, Piggy-

1153
02:03:24,605 --> 02:03:26,774
Piggy?

1154
02:03:59,224 --> 02:04:00,975
Piggy-

1155
02:04:03,895 --> 02:04:06,105
You came to see me.

1156
02:04:09,568 --> 02:04:11,653
I said I would.

1157
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:13,697
Piggy-

1158
02:04:16,658 --> 02:04:20,871
Still want to play Ride High?

1159
02:06:37,423 --> 02:06:40,010
I'll kill that witch.

1160
02:07:41,863 --> 02:07:43,698
Don't move.

1161
02:07:53,123 --> 02:07:54,792
Zhou Yu.

1162
02:07:54,958 --> 02:07:56,293
Viceroy Zhou.

1163
02:07:56,461 --> 02:07:58,546
- The traitor Cao Cao.
- Silence!

1164
02:07:58,712 --> 02:08:01,548
You shall call me
Prime Minister.

1165
02:08:03,176 --> 02:08:08,055
I never guessed I'd lose
to a gust of wind.

1166
02:08:08,222 --> 02:08:10,225
Because you don't understand
the Will of Heaven.

1167
02:08:10,391 --> 02:08:15,939
I never dreamed I'd be defeated
by a cup of tea.

1168
02:08:17,815 --> 02:08:20,734
For you, war was just
a tea ceremony.

1169
02:08:20,902 --> 02:08:22,569
Such a pity.

1170
02:08:22,737 --> 02:08:24,488
You never knew
what you were fighting for.

1171
02:08:24,655 --> 02:08:26,573
I come by order of the Emperor

1172
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:30,744
to subdue rebels like you.

1173
02:08:30,912 --> 02:08:34,248
We are not rebelling against the Emperor,
but against you.

1174
02:08:34,416 --> 02:08:35,958
You scum.

1175
02:09:11,786 --> 02:09:13,621
Little boy.

1176
02:09:13,787 --> 02:09:17,292
This has been quite
an enjoyable hunt.

1177
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:19,461
What do you want to hunt?

1178
02:09:19,627 --> 02:09:21,296
Tigers.

1179
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,881
By the looks of you,

1180
02:09:24,882 --> 02:09:28,344
you are a far cry
from your father.

1181
02:09:32,222 --> 02:09:33,766
Shoot!

1182
02:09:43,443 --> 02:09:46,154
I am Prime Minister
of the Emperor's court.

1183
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:49,657
Death is too good
for rebels like you.

1184
02:09:49,823 --> 02:09:51,826
If you declare allegiance to me,

1185
02:09:51,993 --> 02:09:55,037
I can pardon you.

1186
02:09:57,998 --> 02:10:00,877
Kneel down, all of you.

1187
02:10:04,671 --> 02:10:07,007
Your time is over.

1188
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,898
Lay down your sword.

1189
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:33,952
Your Highness, kill them.

1190
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:36,537
Kill them all!

1191
02:10:38,122 --> 02:10:40,041
Xiao Qiao!

1192
02:10:40,207 --> 02:10:42,042
Are you both safe?

1193
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:45,212
We are both fine.

1194
02:10:48,382 --> 02:10:50,342
We lost

1195
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:52,220
all because of you!

1196
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:55,849
Kneel down before me.

1197
02:11:05,024 --> 02:11:08,194
Kneel to me and
I will spare Xiao Qiao.

1198
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:09,820
We won't let you harm her.

1199
02:11:09,988 --> 02:11:11,573
“We”?

1200
02:11:11,738 --> 02:11:13,908
You mean “them”?

1201
02:11:14,074 --> 02:11:16,159
That motley troop?

1202
02:11:16,327 --> 02:11:18,453
They are my friends.

1203
02:11:19,913 --> 02:11:22,000
War knows no friends.

1204
02:11:22,166 --> 02:11:26,753
Tomorrow, they will be your enemies.

1205
02:11:30,091 --> 02:11:31,759
General!

1206
02:11:31,926 --> 02:11:33,051
Push her off!

1207
02:11:33,219 --> 02:11:35,095
Die!

1208
02:11:52,697 --> 02:11:54,282
Your Honor!

1209
02:12:11,925 --> 02:12:14,510
Are you both all right?

1210
02:12:33,488 --> 02:12:35,113
Let's go.

1211
02:12:37,115 --> 02:12:41,621
I promise I will take you home.

1212
02:13:30,377 --> 02:13:31,878
Go.

1213
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:37,217
Go back to where ever you came from.

1214
02:14:03,243 --> 02:14:07,247
There is no victor here.

1215
02:14:53,377 --> 02:14:55,212
Meng Mel19-

1216
02:14:56,213 --> 02:14:59,509
Go on now, go.

1217
02:15:10,811 --> 02:15:12,646
Meng Mel19-

1218
02:15:22,614 --> 02:15:25,408
From division comes unity,
and from unity, division.

1219
02:15:25,576 --> 02:15:27,828
Liu Bei won't stand
being second best.

1220
02:15:27,994 --> 02:15:31,498
One day, we will face each other
on the battlefield.

1221
02:15:31,666 --> 02:15:35,336
No man can tell the future.

1222
02:15:35,502 --> 02:15:37,421
The world is full of heroes,

1223
02:15:37,587 --> 02:15:41,842
but you're the one
I most fear offending.

1224
02:15:42,009 --> 02:15:43,569
You would be
an opponent I'd truly fear.

1225
02:15:43,677 --> 02:15:44,845
Me?

1226
02:15:45,011 --> 02:15:47,849
I'd best return home
and get some sleep.

1227
02:15:48,015 --> 02:15:50,016
Are you a good farmer?

1228
02:15:50,184 --> 02:15:52,185
I planted lotus flowers once

1229
02:15:52,353 --> 02:15:54,020
but none lived long.

1230
02:15:54,188 --> 02:15:58,024
Do not be humble.
You have brought peace to the land.

1231
02:15:59,652 --> 02:16:03,363
In this alliance, I found true friends.

1232
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:05,323
No matter what
may happen,

1233
02:16:05,492 --> 02:16:07,159
this experience
is engraved in my heart.

1234
02:16:07,327 --> 02:16:10,037
I too will not forget.

1235
02:16:16,502 --> 02:16:17,920
Zhu-ge Liang!

1236
02:16:18,087 --> 02:16:20,797
When Meng Meng has grown,
do not make her a war horse.

1237
02:16:20,965 --> 02:16:22,382
Don't worry.

1238
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:24,886
These hands helped birth her.

1239
02:16:25,052 --> 02:16:27,889
I shall always cherish her.
