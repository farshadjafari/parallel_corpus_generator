2
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,795
Charlie!

3
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:33,830
Watch out!

4
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,005
My hand!

5
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:03,485
Goddamn!

6
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,115
We're running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.

7
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,415
Move!

8
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,850
Come on!

9
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:38,980
Come on, you can do it!
Come on!

10
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,375
We got nothin', Enders!
We're out of ammo!

11
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Joe... Nobody else needs to die.
We can go! We can get outta here!

12
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,680
We got orders!

13
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,350
They told us to hold the position!
And that's what we're gonna do!

14
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,405
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!

15
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:35,077
Come on!

16
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:37,955
Get down!

17
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,419
Tommy.

18
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:48,465
Goddamn you!

19
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:56,098
Oh, no!
No!

20
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,446
- Bill!
- I'm out.

21
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,036
Come on!
Come on!

22
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,386
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.

23
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:37,931
No... No!

24
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:42,686
No!

25
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:56,366
Raise your right hand.

26
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,078
- I... State your full name...
- I, Ben Yahzee...

27
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:09,379
Do solemnly swear to support and
defend the constitution of the US...

28
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:14,593
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

29
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:18,180
Jap Ha-Go.
Who can give me the code word for "tank"?

30
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,982
Come on.
You boys wanna be codetalkers.

31
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,902
Show me some brains.
Think!

32
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:34,488
What do we call a tank?

33
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,243
<i>Chay-da-gahi.</i>

34
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,707
Tortoise.
Good.

35
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:50,170
Artillery.
Code word?

36
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,176
In code.
Private Whitehorse.

37
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,929
<i>Be-al-doh-tso-lani?</i>

38
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,474
Very good.

39
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:04,518
Japanese Zero.
Code word?

40
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,597
We can go!
We can get outta here!

41
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:44,808
They told us to hold the position!

42
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:01,616
Nice day, huh?

43
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:04,035
Joe?

44
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:16,423
Joe.

45
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,431
Didn't hear a word, did you?

46
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:28,143
That's what happens to a man
when he's talking to a beautiful woman.

47
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:31,438
It happens when you're
not watching my lips, Joe.

48
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,778
Watch this.

49
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:01,760
You're a mess, Joe.
You're not fooling anybody.

50
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:04,220
No, Rita.
He's a mess.

51
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:08,266
I'm getting better every day.

52
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,562
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium's all screwy.

53
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:15,690
You can't go back to war
if you can't stand up.

54
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:19,736
Let's go, marines. This war
ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.

55
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,198
Joe...

56
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,386
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?

57
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,934
Somebody's gotta keep the WAVES company.

58
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:54,604
Are you gonna help me or not?

59
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:49,576
Marked improvement.

60
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:52,620
And his left ear is the worse of the two?

61
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:15,727
It's... amazing.

62
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:29,490
TBY hasn't got the range of the TBX.

63
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:33,161
So you may need a relay to get
your transmission to command post.

64
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:37,582
But what it really comes down to
is speed and accuracy under pressure.

65
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,710
Transcribe now.

66
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:43,588
Victor, Victor.
This is X-ray. Over.

67
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:54,182
Damn it!
We got a unit under fire!

68
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,434
We're losing men.

69
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:58,770
I need this message decrypted.

70
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:09,822
"Request fire support. We have target
at one-one-niner, Baker one-five."

71
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:12,909
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will."

72
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,375
Beginner's luck.

73
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:51,447
You're up, mac.

74
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,163
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.

75
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:08,506
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.

76
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,759
Better than you did as a civilian.

77
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:16,139
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.

78
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:21,644
Assault and battery...
on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

79
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,314
A priest?

80
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:30,194
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan
High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.

81
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,531
Public-school boy myself.

82
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:37,285
Some minor problems in boot.

83
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:40,955
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.

84
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:44,584
And you made a hell of a stand
on the Solomons.

85
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,752
Tough bit of business there, huh?

86
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,130
Pretty tough, sir.

87
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,508
But you're prepared
to jump right back into it?

88
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,427
Yes, sir.
Very much so.

89
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,847
Very much so.

90
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,558
Well...

91
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:07,148
The Japs have pretty much busted
every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.

92
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:10,276
You men on the Solomons
were lost to a broken code.

93
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:14,989
Tell me something. You ever
run into any Indians on the Solomons?

94
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:18,117
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.

95
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:22,872
The Corps has developed a new code
based on their language.

96
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,874
It's had quite an impact.

97
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:29,003
So much so the navy have decided
to go to great lengths to protect it.

98
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:31,380
That's why you're here.

99
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,551
You're to pair with one of them,
keep his ass safe.

100
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:38,888
Your job is to keep him alive
so he can do his job.

101
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:43,267
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,

102
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,311
not baby-sitting some Indian.

103
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:48,272
Enders, we didn't pick
your name out of a hat.

104
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:50,941
We need good marines.

105
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,653
That's why you're standing here.

106
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:56,572
Take a look.

107
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,783
It's a Navajo.
Or it was.

108
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:02,787
Tortured to death by Japanese
intelligence trying to bust our code.

109
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,374
Fortunately, he couldn't help them
even if he wanted to.

110
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:10,044
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.

111
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:13,756
Code's based on their language,
but it is still a code.

112
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:18,844
Tojo would like nothing more
than to catch a live one.

113
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:24,058
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal,
cannot leave this room.

114
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:31,273
Under no circumstances can you allow
your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.

115
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:35,236
Your mission is to protect the code...

116
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:38,948
at all costs.

117
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,201
You understand me?

118
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,622
Yes, sir, I do.

119
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,416
Good.

120
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,085
Congratulations.
You just made sergeant.

121
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,638
Keep those hands vertical.

122
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,682
Way to go, marine.

123
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:54,607
Fortino, take over.

124
00:19:56,233 --> 00:20:00,696
Hey... That was you, right,
sitting in front of the major's office?

125
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:03,032
Yeah.
Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.

126
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:07,786
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.

127
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,999
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.

128
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,169
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

129
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:21,884
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

130
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,178
No fuckin' idea, mac.

131
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:27,348
Thanks.
Thanks a bunch.

132
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:39,860
They've never seen so many Navajo.

133
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:46,367
Looks to me like you got to see
a little action there.

134
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,119
Me too.

135
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,539
Jap sons of bitches
shot me right in the ass.

136
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:55,793
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.

137
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:04,760
So, your duty with JASCO have anything
to do with these Navajo radiomen?

138
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:09,348
I'm not at liberty to say.

139
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:14,061
I see you got a new stripe there.
Me too.

140
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:20,609
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell
me are the same orders I can't tell you.

141
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,403
Hell of a thing, huh?

142
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:25,114
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.

143
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,657
Yeah.

144
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:32,955
They look pretty normal, I guess.

145
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,416
Expecting them to wear war paint?

146
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:42,631
Maybe we ought to go introduce ourselves.
They look a little lost to me.

147
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,427
Henderson.

148
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,179
I wouldn't get too friendly.

149
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:56,979
How!

150
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:59,231
Just kiddin'.
I'm Ox.

151
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:01,066
Whitehorse.

152
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,068
This is Yahzee.
Ben.

153
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:08,198
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

154
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:11,535
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?

155
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,618
Mind if I join you?

156
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:57,122
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.

157
00:22:57,956 --> 00:22:59,791
How you doin'?

158
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,628
You're blocking my view.

159
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:07,883
Oh, sorry.

160
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,679
What do they call this crap anyway?

161
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:14,806
Marines call it chow.

162
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:20,354
Well, there's a propaganda effort.

163
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,741
Sorry.
You can have mine.

164
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,369
Shit.

165
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,711
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?

166
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:47,047
It's Yahzee.
Ben Yahzee.

167
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:50,467
Hold this.

168
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,861
Shit.

169
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:32,551
I'm in for a couple more.

170
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:39,391
Tell him I say hello.

171
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:42,894
Pair of cowboys for Big E.

172
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:47,816
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.

173
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:50,944
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.

174
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:54,281
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.

175
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:57,743
All right.

176
00:24:58,785 --> 00:25:01,371
OK... Oh, another mess
for the Sunshine State.

177
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:04,040
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.

178
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:06,835
Hey! Look at that.
A trio of nines. Pretty.

179
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:09,171
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.

180
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:12,174
Nines bets.
I'll raise it two bits.

181
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:14,843
Call.

182
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,970
We all got thumbs up our asses.

183
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:22,267
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy
in Intel that says we ship out in a week.

184
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:24,352
I been hearing "next week" for a month.

185
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:28,315
I didn't know you knew
anybody in Intelligence, Harri.

186
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:31,318
Next year'd be all right with me.

187
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,947
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.

188
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:38,825
Full boat, baby.

189
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:41,161
Cowboys over queens.
Read 'em and die.

190
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,164
Oh, Jesus!

191
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,712
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.

192
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:54,132
God knows what a girl will do
without reassurance.

193
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:56,801
Son of a bitch.

194
00:25:56,885 --> 00:26:01,348
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats
opening up. You wanna come join us?

195
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,976
Are you serious?

196
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,606
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?

197
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:13,235
Card on the head,
only fool can't see it is you.

198
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,988
You want to come on over, or what?

199
00:26:21,284 --> 00:26:23,286
Cut me in.

200
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:35,131
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

201
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:37,008
Hey, don't let him scare you.

202
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:42,222
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's
like any other. Waste of time and money.

203
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:46,393
Well, ante up... Chief.

204
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:49,104
How'd you know I was a chief?

205
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:52,482
You must've seen me showering
with my war bonnet.

206
00:27:05,537 --> 00:27:09,207
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.

207
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,292
Beautiful.

208
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:38,528
All right, then.

209
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,989
Orders finally came through.

210
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:44,159
We ship out tomorrow morning.

211
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:54,252
Destination: the island of Saipan,

212
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:59,674
which is one of the stepping stones
we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.

213
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,386
It's of strategic importance
that we capture this island.

214
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,222
We can get ourselves
an advanced naval base

215
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:09,642
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's

216
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:12,562
and get our bombers
within range of Tokyo.

217
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:18,902
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil,
and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.

218
00:28:18,943 --> 00:28:21,446
They're gonna fight for every square inch,

219
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,200
because it's their home,
but we're gonna take it away from 'em!

220
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:28,203
Yeah!
Kill me some Japs!

221
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,003
We're gonna be in front
of the whole damn division.

222
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,714
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.

223
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:43,051
We're gonna be
sniffin' out enemy positions,

224
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,011
coordinating the naval gunfire -

225
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:50,016
exactly what we've been training to do
for the last four months. All right?

226
00:28:57,357 --> 00:29:01,194
Now, we got some new radiomen
from headquarters.

227
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,155
There's a Private Whitehorse...

228
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:09,994
and Yahzee...

229
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,583
and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson,

230
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,836
who, if I'm understanding
these orders correctly,

231
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,257
will be covering our Navajos' asses.

232
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:47,156
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

233
00:29:55,665 --> 00:30:01,004
...but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin'
into our share of the shit nonetheless.

234
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,591
Any questions?

235
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:27,572
Sounds like you're dying.

236
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:30,408
These might help get rid of the taste.

237
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,871
Charlie and I, we both lost it
on the boat ride from San Diego.

238
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:37,790
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.

239
00:30:38,332 --> 00:30:40,460
Life Savers really helped.

240
00:30:41,002 --> 00:30:43,004
You want a Life Saver?

241
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:47,633
What are you doin' here?

242
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:50,344
Just trying to help.

243
00:30:58,102 --> 00:31:00,104
Not what I meant.

244
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,775
You mean what am I doing in this uniform?

245
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:06,819
It's my war too, Sergeant.

246
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:10,531
I'm fighting for my country,
for my land, for my people.

247
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:14,285
Not your people I'm worried about.

248
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:18,748
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.

249
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,835
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes
to do what used to take an hour.

250
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:26,005
Now, somebody wearing
a lot more stripes than you

251
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:28,508
thinks that's worth something.

252
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:32,386
Remind me to time you when
you got bullets flying over your head.

253
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:41,646
What the hell's wrong with you?

254
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:52,406
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

255
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,118
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!

256
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:04,460
From the halls of Montezuma

257
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:08,422
To the shores of Tripoli

258
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:13,219
We will fight our country's battles

259
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:16,973
On the land and on the sea

260
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:21,602
First to fight for right and freedom

261
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:25,314
And to keep our honor clean

262
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:29,652
We are proud to claim the title

263
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:33,531
Of United States Marines

264
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:51,257
Hi.

265
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,261
How's that ear?

266
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,849
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if
it starts aching, take a couple of those.

267
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:02,059
And call me in the morning.

268
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:08,316
You're not gonna be here
in the morning, are you?

269
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:13,404
Shipping out without even
buying me a drink.

270
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:18,451
Ought to be ashamed of yourself,
hustling a... hustling marines.

271
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:23,414
What's your poison?

272
00:33:23,497 --> 00:33:27,460
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I'll get a shot of something.

273
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:29,128
Rum.

274
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:31,797
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.

275
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:33,883
Make that two.

276
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:35,968
May as well join me, huh?

277
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:38,763
- Why not?
- OK.

278
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:43,976
Thank you.

279
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:47,980
Well... to war.

280
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:19,011
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

281
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:33,818
Get those men spread out!

282
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,197
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!

283
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:07,870
Come on, keep up!

284
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:15,002
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

285
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:37,566
- How am I doin'?
- You're good.

286
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:49,286
Let's go!

287
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:51,997
Stay on my ass.

288
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,267
I told you to stay on my ass!

289
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,609
- Stay low!
- Get out of there!

290
00:38:49,323 --> 00:38:50,741
Go!

291
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,451
Get him outta there!

292
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,536
Get me outta here!

293
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,126
- Hold still, damn it!
- Get him outta there!

294
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,140
You sons of bitches!

295
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:02,062
Fortino!
Cover me!

296
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:04,147
Whitehorse, get down!

297
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,012
Get down!

298
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,443
Pappas!

299
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:57,367
Corpsman!

300
00:40:57,409 --> 00:41:00,036
Helmet goes on your head!
Corpsman!

301
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,664
Take care of him.

302
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:07,377
Put a hand on this.

303
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:22,475
Tank!
Tank! Tank!

304
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:29,399
You ready?
Go! Go!

305
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:36,615
Harrigan, light it up!

306
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:52,047
Let's go, boys!
Keep up the fight!

307
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,312
Are you hit?
Are you hit?

308
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:10,023
You're OK.
You're good, you're good.

309
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,777
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.

310
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:16,946
- Harri?
- You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy.

311
00:42:16,988 --> 00:42:19,324
- Stay low!
- Nellie? Pappas?

312
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,409
Yeah, we're good.

313
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,372
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate.

314
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:26,706
What?

315
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:29,584
I can't breathe when I get excited.

316
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:32,671
Goddamn!
Must be hell on your gal!

317
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:56,194
Enders, get the navy on the horn
and tell 'em to dig out those guns.

318
00:42:57,404 --> 00:43:00,281
Target reference... dog one...

319
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:02,951
right 700.

320
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:05,453
Elevation zero-five-zero.

321
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:15,213
Relay the damn coordinates!

322
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:21,219
Arizona!
Arizona!

323
00:44:07,932 --> 00:44:10,393
Target reference, dog one,

324
00:44:10,435 --> 00:44:14,272
south 700, elevation zero-five-zero.

325
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,130
Right 200!

326
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:42,467
Up 50.
Fire for effect.

327
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:15,166
Let's go!

328
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:16,751
Move!

329
00:45:58,835 --> 00:46:00,795
Harrigan!

330
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:03,840
Torch the box!

331
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:56,517
Kill him!

332
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,002
Goddamn it!

333
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:26,923
Shit.

334
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:31,302
Nellie.
Take the satchel charge.

335
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:34,138
You hear me?
Move!

336
00:47:40,645 --> 00:47:42,396
You're gonna cover me, right?

337
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,565
I'll go with you.
We flank left.

338
00:47:45,274 --> 00:47:47,568
I'll cover you.
Smoke and cover.

339
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:49,654
I can do this.

340
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:54,283
I can do this.

341
00:48:04,085 --> 00:48:06,045
Smoke 'em up!

342
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:13,511
Cover up.

343
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,272
Shit!

344
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:16,198
Shit.
Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!

345
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,608
Biscuits?
How can you ruin biscuits?

346
00:49:51,025 --> 00:49:54,487
You are a whiny son of a bitch
right now, aren't you?

347
00:49:56,655 --> 00:50:00,826
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does
that make it on the East Coast?

348
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,496
How the fucking hell should I know?

349
00:50:04,246 --> 00:50:06,248
Just seven...

350
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,502
It's 8am, Sunday morning.

351
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:13,005
I hope my side of the bed
didn't get taken up Saturday night.

352
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:17,218
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer,
you keep worrying about her.

353
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:19,470
Might get my ass
sent back to Rhody, though.

354
00:50:19,553 --> 00:50:23,891
There's plenty of dollies outside
of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty.

355
00:50:23,974 --> 00:50:27,186
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.
- Ain't that the truth.

356
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:32,399
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.

357
00:50:32,483 --> 00:50:35,277
This one time, before the war,

358
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:42,326
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little
thing named Molly comes out the water.

359
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,288
She walks straight up to me
and asks me if I'm hungry...

360
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:49,333
cos she's havin' a weenie roast.

361
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,293
Shit!
Damn.

362
00:50:51,585 --> 00:50:53,879
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.

363
00:50:58,884 --> 00:51:02,221
Now I'm on Saipan with this
giant Zippo strapped to my back

364
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:04,556
and I'm roastin' human beings.

365
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:14,483
Why I volunteered... beyond me.

366
00:51:16,568 --> 00:51:19,071
Damn, I'm proud to be here.

367
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:21,573
My whole family's been in the Corps.

368
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,493
My old man, he's a lifer.

369
00:51:24,868 --> 00:51:27,579
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.

370
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,040
Around the house too.

371
00:51:34,586 --> 00:51:36,839
Maybe now he'll back off.

372
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:46,223
Pappas, I...

373
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:49,893
I want you to do me a favor.

374
00:51:52,187 --> 00:51:54,440
If anything should happen to me,

375
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:57,276
you make sure that my wife gets this.

376
00:51:59,862 --> 00:52:02,406
I mean, she picked them out and all.

377
00:52:02,823 --> 00:52:04,867
Don't talk like that, Nell.

378
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:08,787
You don't even joke about shit like that.

379
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:12,708
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.

380
00:53:08,305 --> 00:53:09,765
Hey.

381
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:12,142
Don't thank me till you've tried it.

382
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:14,853
You missed mail call.

383
00:53:25,197 --> 00:53:27,324
What the hell are they doin'?

384
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:30,953
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.

385
00:53:37,543 --> 00:53:39,836
Sounds like some kind of prayer.

386
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:49,471
Maybe they know our orders.

387
00:54:04,194 --> 00:54:06,154
Think you could do it, Joe?

388
00:54:06,196 --> 00:54:08,323
Give it a rest, Henderson.

389
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:12,160
Give it a rest?
I keep tryin', but...

390
00:54:13,662 --> 00:54:15,747
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.

391
00:55:16,725 --> 00:55:19,394
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

392
00:55:19,478 --> 00:55:21,772
Getting on my uniform.

393
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:25,567
You know the difference
between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

394
00:55:28,278 --> 00:55:30,280
It's that uniform.

395
00:55:30,864 --> 00:55:32,866
That's it.

396
00:55:34,409 --> 00:55:36,286
See, I know you people.

397
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:40,290
I know what kind
of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.

398
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:43,376
You ought to be careful out here all alone.

399
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,087
No baby-sitter.

400
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,590
I might just take you for a Jap.

401
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:52,052
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

402
00:55:52,135 --> 00:55:55,305
Or keep demonstrating
what an ignorant fool you are?

403
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,646
How's that for an ignorant fool?

404
00:56:20,413 --> 00:56:22,457
Go ahead, try again.

405
00:56:34,052 --> 00:56:36,221
You gonna do somethin'?

406
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:59,411
Chick!
Come on!

407
00:56:59,494 --> 00:57:01,454
Get off me!

408
00:57:21,016 --> 00:57:23,602
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.

409
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:26,021
Ben?
Shit.

410
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:33,236
I thought he was a Jap. You know,
killed some marine for that uniform.

411
00:57:34,946 --> 00:57:36,865
Sure you did, Chick.

412
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,076
Damn Injun looks just like
a Jap, don't he?

413
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,162
Look, I'm no damn Injun.

414
00:57:42,787 --> 00:57:47,709
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,
born for the Towering House clan.

415
00:57:51,379 --> 00:57:53,506
But you do look like a Nip.

416
00:57:53,548 --> 00:57:58,511
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.

417
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,392
Fuckin' shitbird.

418
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,229
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter
all the time, I thought.

419
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:10,231
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.

420
00:58:12,484 --> 00:58:17,030
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.

421
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:23,853
Navajo believe, until a body's given
a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.

422
00:58:24,412 --> 00:58:28,875
<i>Chindis, that's what we call evil spirits.
Demons.</i>

423
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:34,589
I haven't thought much about it
since I was a kid.

424
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:37,092
Till I saw those dead bodies.

425
00:58:37,175 --> 00:58:39,719
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

426
00:58:39,803 --> 00:58:42,680
No, Sergeant.
I'm telling you I won't freeze up again.

427
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:45,767
Because your buddy
smeared ash on your forehead?

428
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:50,146
That's right.
Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead.

429
00:58:57,862 --> 00:59:00,031
You ever see ghosts?

430
00:59:04,828 --> 00:59:08,665
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.

431
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,240
Sounds beautiful.

432
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:44,951
You, uh, you self-taught?

433
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:47,871
My dad was always playing.

434
00:59:48,788 --> 00:59:52,000
You know what they say:
if you can't beat 'em...

435
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:57,338
No shit.
My dad, he... he gave me this thing.

436
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,175
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.

437
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:05,138
Used to bring 'em in for feeding
with this little tune I played.

438
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,350
I know I ain't gonna get you
to quit playin' that thing, so...

439
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:11,769
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...

440
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:14,439
I don't think it's gonna work.

441
01:00:15,857 --> 01:00:19,110
Well, we ain't got much else to do out here.
What the hell?

442
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:21,946
OK.

443
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:25,450
All right, you lead off.
I'll follow you.

444
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:36,646
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

445
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:42,151
Or, given that you're not much of a
writer, should I not expect an answer?

446
01:01:42,235 --> 01:01:45,196
The newspapers say
our boys are doing great.

447
01:01:45,238 --> 01:01:49,742
But I don't think the reporters
have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.

448
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:53,913
I found a stray dog
the other day on Waikiki.

449
01:01:53,996 --> 01:01:56,707
I gave him a bath and took him in.

450
01:01:56,791 --> 01:02:00,336
He reminded me of you - but cuter.

451
01:02:02,171 --> 01:02:04,841
At least he keeps me warm at night.

452
01:02:06,008 --> 01:02:10,680
I try not to think about you.
About what might be happening over there.

453
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,641
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,

454
01:02:13,683 --> 01:02:17,061
I can't keep myself
from wondering where you are.

455
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:19,147
How you're doing.

456
01:02:29,574 --> 01:02:31,617
What the hell you doin'?

457
01:02:32,201 --> 01:02:34,704
Writing a letter to my son.

458
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:37,331
Forget your orders?
No letters out.

459
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:41,168
Command don't want postmarks
going to the reservation.

460
01:02:45,923 --> 01:02:47,842
Hey!
You hear me?

461
01:02:53,431 --> 01:02:56,809
I thought that he might read 'em
when I get home.

462
01:03:02,523 --> 01:03:04,609
What's his name?

463
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:06,611
Your son.

464
01:03:06,986 --> 01:03:10,197
It's George.
George Washington.

465
01:03:11,574 --> 01:03:13,784
George Washington Yahzee.

466
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:18,080
It's got a bit of a ring to it.

467
01:03:19,582 --> 01:03:21,542
My wife wasn't so sure.

468
01:03:22,001 --> 01:03:24,462
She's a little more traditional.

469
01:03:27,173 --> 01:03:29,717
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.

470
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:34,430
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.

471
01:03:37,975 --> 01:03:40,102
Can I try one of those?

472
01:03:40,895 --> 01:03:43,773
- You smoke?
- Not really.

473
01:04:22,645 --> 01:04:25,106
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!

474
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,192
Let's go!
Let's go!

475
01:04:28,818 --> 01:04:30,778
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

476
01:04:39,245 --> 01:04:41,747
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!

477
01:04:43,165 --> 01:04:44,792
Yahzee!

478
01:04:46,293 --> 01:04:47,878
I'm hit!

479
01:04:47,962 --> 01:04:50,214
Take it off!
It burns!

480
01:04:54,677 --> 01:04:57,138
You're not hit. Just shut up.
You're not hit.

481
01:05:15,114 --> 01:05:17,533
- Spread out!
- Move!

482
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:30,421
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.

483
01:05:30,588 --> 01:05:32,464
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.

484
01:05:33,591 --> 01:05:37,052
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.

485
01:05:37,136 --> 01:05:39,013
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!

486
01:05:39,096 --> 01:05:43,475
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.

487
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:49,231
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.

488
01:05:49,273 --> 01:05:50,900
Do somethin'.

489
01:05:50,983 --> 01:05:53,485
Shit... Follow me!

490
01:05:53,569 --> 01:05:56,280
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!

491
01:06:18,302 --> 01:06:19,845
God.

492
01:06:42,534 --> 01:06:44,244
Son of a bitch!

493
01:07:06,016 --> 01:07:08,102
I got you, mac!

494
01:07:12,981 --> 01:07:14,817
Corpsman!

495
01:07:15,484 --> 01:07:18,278
Corpsman!

496
01:07:23,701 --> 01:07:25,744
Corpsman!

497
01:07:27,287 --> 01:07:29,289
Nellie!

498
01:07:33,085 --> 01:07:35,087
Corpsman!

499
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:06,660
You were right, Joe.

500
01:08:07,453 --> 01:08:09,204
I do look like a Nip.

501
01:08:09,288 --> 01:08:11,373
What the hell are you talking about?

502
01:08:11,457 --> 01:08:15,878
Putting on that Jap uniform. Trying to get
one of their radios, call off our guns.

503
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:18,714
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.

504
01:08:18,797 --> 01:08:21,925
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.

505
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:24,595
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!

506
01:08:28,765 --> 01:08:32,144
He's just a kid!
You killed your own!

507
01:08:32,686 --> 01:08:37,441
What's wrong with you?
You killed your own! Sons of bitches!

508
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:40,485
You killed your own!

509
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:59,880
- Sure you're up to this?
- Find out soon enough, sir.

510
01:09:02,758 --> 01:09:05,969
- What the hell are you doin' there?
- I'm goin' with him.

511
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:08,305
If that's OK with you.

512
01:09:11,642 --> 01:09:13,644
Give me the rifle.

513
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,232
<i>Horyo-da.</i>

514
01:09:19,816 --> 01:09:21,944
It's Jap for prisoner.

515
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:24,696
<i>Horyo-da.</i>

516
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:34,706
<i>Horyo-da.</i>

517
01:09:37,668 --> 01:09:40,003
All right, everybody be ready.

518
01:10:37,728 --> 01:10:38,854
<i>Horyo-da!</i>

519
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,612
Now!

520
01:10:58,623 --> 01:11:00,459
Hit me.
Hit me.

521
01:11:16,308 --> 01:11:18,310
Please don't hit me!

522
01:11:57,974 --> 01:11:59,351
Yahzee!

523
01:12:08,735 --> 01:12:10,904
Kill him!

524
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:18,578
Goddamn it, kill him!

525
01:12:25,168 --> 01:12:27,003
Get on the radio!

526
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:38,556
Bowie White, Bowie White,
this is Carson Red!

527
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:44,229
Cease fire! Cease fire!
You're shelling marines!

528
01:12:45,605 --> 01:12:47,607
Sergeant!

529
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:52,153
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

530
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:57,450
Add 325, fire for effect!

531
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:02,372
Redirect fire.
Add 325, fire for effect.

532
01:13:02,956 --> 01:13:04,958
Let's go!

533
01:13:07,335 --> 01:13:09,462
Crank it up!
Let's go!

534
01:13:09,504 --> 01:13:11,214
Commence fire!

535
01:13:11,297 --> 01:13:13,133
Fire!

536
01:13:19,014 --> 01:13:20,515
Yeah!

537
01:13:20,598 --> 01:13:22,183
Well, I'll be.

538
01:13:49,002 --> 01:13:50,879
Colonel.
Can I help you, sir?

539
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,716
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders.
Joseph F Enders.

540
01:13:55,884 --> 01:13:57,719
Enders.

541
01:14:06,227 --> 01:14:08,104
Yes, sir.

542
01:14:08,855 --> 01:14:12,108
Report I read claims
you went above and beyond.

543
01:14:13,735 --> 01:14:14,903
Sir?

544
01:14:14,986 --> 01:14:17,405
You've been recommended for commendation.

545
01:14:17,447 --> 01:14:20,700
And I concur. But I don't see any point
in you having to wait around

546
01:14:20,783 --> 01:14:25,121
for all those formalities
to work themselves out.

547
01:14:25,914 --> 01:14:28,333
Not when I got one of these handy.

548
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:31,503
Congratulations, Enders.

549
01:14:31,586 --> 01:14:33,713
You saved a lot of marines.

550
01:14:42,388 --> 01:14:47,101
I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have
done it without Private Ben Yahzee.

551
01:14:47,185 --> 01:14:49,646
Oh... Right.

552
01:14:50,522 --> 01:14:52,524
The, uh, Indian.

553
01:14:53,942 --> 01:14:57,570
Begging the colonel's pardon,
he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,

554
01:14:57,612 --> 01:14:59,656
born for the Towering House clan.

555
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:05,912
Of course. Navajo.
Towering House clan.

556
01:15:12,377 --> 01:15:14,587
You keep up the good work, Enders.

557
01:15:53,293 --> 01:15:55,628
Send that to Nellie's wife.

558
01:16:36,085 --> 01:16:38,963
You ever not miss mail call, Enders?

559
01:16:45,845 --> 01:16:48,473
My mom says somebody
takes the time to write a letter,

560
01:16:48,556 --> 01:16:50,808
you should read the letter.

561
01:16:53,644 --> 01:16:56,147
Does she let you drink, your mother?

562
01:16:56,731 --> 01:16:59,358
No.
But she's not here.

563
01:17:13,456 --> 01:17:17,210
- What is it?
- Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that.

564
01:17:17,293 --> 01:17:20,505
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake.
But it does the trick.

565
01:17:24,008 --> 01:17:26,636
How much of this crap do you have anyway?

566
01:17:29,388 --> 01:17:32,183
You have a little trouble with that ear,
don't you, Joe?

567
01:17:32,225 --> 01:17:37,522
Ah, real problem's the inner ear.
It's anvils and stirrups and shit.

568
01:17:40,233 --> 01:17:42,401
I'm a little out of balance.

569
01:17:44,987 --> 01:17:48,199
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee.

570
01:17:48,324 --> 01:17:50,451
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

571
01:17:51,077 --> 01:17:53,788
I bet I surprised the shit out of you.

572
01:17:59,085 --> 01:18:01,462
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe.

573
01:18:02,129 --> 01:18:04,549
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife.

574
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,051
I don't give a shit about medals.

575
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:19,438
The first one they gave me...

576
01:18:21,065 --> 01:18:23,234
I threw it into the ocean.

577
01:18:25,278 --> 01:18:27,780
What'd you get that one for?

578
01:18:27,863 --> 01:18:29,615
For not dyin'.

579
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:36,330
The 15 men who fought with me
got decorated too. For dying.

580
01:18:36,998 --> 01:18:38,624
So...

581
01:18:43,462 --> 01:18:46,632
Lieutenant was killed
the night before and...

582
01:18:48,384 --> 01:18:52,847
none of the sergeants even made it
out of the landing craft, so...

583
01:18:55,266 --> 01:18:58,477
that left me in charge.
It was my first command.

584
01:19:00,646 --> 01:19:07,111
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp
marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.

585
01:19:10,656 --> 01:19:12,616
And I did.

586
01:19:15,995 --> 01:19:18,998
All of the men under my command...

587
01:19:24,378 --> 01:19:26,338
men who trusted me...

588
01:19:31,469 --> 01:19:34,930
who begged me to pull back...

589
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,562
not one of them made it.

590
01:19:45,483 --> 01:19:48,486
Just one stupid asshole.

591
01:19:54,241 --> 01:19:57,703
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.

592
01:20:00,748 --> 01:20:02,875
What were their names?

593
01:20:04,126 --> 01:20:06,712
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.

594
01:20:07,338 --> 01:20:10,132
You know, who they were
and what they were like.

595
01:20:12,676 --> 01:20:17,890
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit.
What the hell for?

596
01:20:18,516 --> 01:20:20,643
To honor them.

597
01:20:21,435 --> 01:20:23,395
Their memory.

598
01:20:24,438 --> 01:20:29,151
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe.
You were just followin' orders.

599
01:20:29,985 --> 01:20:31,779
Yeah.

600
01:20:31,862 --> 01:20:34,782
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

601
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:40,788
That's why they gave me this detail.

602
01:20:45,417 --> 01:20:47,169
Yeah.

603
01:20:47,628 --> 01:20:49,922
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

604
01:21:19,702 --> 01:21:21,537
- Joe!
- What?

605
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:29,253
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

606
01:21:29,336 --> 01:21:30,796
Really.

607
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:49,440
It's all right.

608
01:21:50,524 --> 01:21:52,985
Come on, Joe.
I got you.

609
01:23:13,315 --> 01:23:15,317
What the fuck?

610
01:23:20,364 --> 01:23:23,826
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee.
You cut that horseshit out.

611
01:24:09,037 --> 01:24:13,292
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in
this Swedish concoction called yoghurt.

612
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,086
God willin', America
will develop the taste.

613
01:24:16,545 --> 01:24:20,500
What about you, Charlie? What's life
got in store for you after this mess?

614
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:21,542
Sheep.

615
01:24:21,925 --> 01:24:24,970
Sheep?
As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?

616
01:24:27,306 --> 01:24:31,268
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock
in the Four Corners area.

617
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:33,312
No shit?

618
01:24:34,021 --> 01:24:37,399
- You a rich man, Whitehorse?
- We do OK.

619
01:24:37,482 --> 01:24:41,862
Taxis. A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em.
That's how I'm making my millions.

620
01:24:42,946 --> 01:24:45,824
And then I'm goin' back
to the motherland.

621
01:24:45,907 --> 01:24:48,994
I'm gonna build myself a villa
on the cliffs of Santorini.

622
01:24:49,077 --> 01:24:52,372
Ah, Santorini, my friends - that's living.

623
01:24:53,415 --> 01:24:56,627
Sounds nice.
What about you, Zee?

624
01:24:57,336 --> 01:24:59,254
Thinkin' about teaching.

625
01:24:59,338 --> 01:25:03,508
Ah, teaching. Bring a little something
back to the reservation?

626
01:25:03,592 --> 01:25:08,639
Actually, more interested in bringing
some of the reservation back to the world.

627
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,433
Hoping to teach college.
American history.

628
01:25:11,516 --> 01:25:13,435
Oh, that's just what we need.

629
01:25:13,518 --> 01:25:18,357
Yahzee teachin' college boys about
Custer's scalpin' at Little Bighorn.

630
01:25:19,066 --> 01:25:22,944
And what about Kit Carson, and what
they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?

631
01:25:23,028 --> 01:25:25,489
You ever read about that, Chick?

632
01:25:26,156 --> 01:25:28,158
Didn't think so.

633
01:25:29,534 --> 01:25:31,536
How about you, Joe?

634
01:25:32,454 --> 01:25:35,207
- What?
- What are you doin' after this mess?

635
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:37,292
It's gotta end sometime.

636
01:25:40,962 --> 01:25:44,174
Dear Joe, we got great news today.

637
01:25:44,841 --> 01:25:48,970
President Roosevelt announced
the end of blackouts on Hawaii.

638
01:25:49,054 --> 01:25:51,681
We thought the day would never come.

639
01:25:52,682 --> 01:25:56,853
There's still a ten o'clock curfew,
but it doesn't matter to me.

640
01:25:57,521 --> 01:26:02,234
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired
to do anything but write letters.

641
01:26:04,945 --> 01:26:10,117
There is a real sense that the war
is going well, and could be over soon.

642
01:26:12,577 --> 01:26:17,124
I think about you more and more.
If you're alive or dead out there.

643
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:22,587
I check the mail every day, knowing
there's going to be an answer.

644
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:25,090
Are you reading these, Joe?

645
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:27,551
Are you listening?

646
01:26:32,889 --> 01:26:35,642
- We're secure on the left side.
- Area's secured.

647
01:26:35,725 --> 01:26:37,894
Set up defense positions.

648
01:26:37,978 --> 01:26:40,230
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.

649
01:26:40,272 --> 01:26:42,065
Harri.

650
01:28:32,467 --> 01:28:35,303
That's startin' to sound like something.

651
01:29:23,643 --> 01:29:25,854
I didn't know you were an artist.

652
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:28,064
Oh, it's stupid.

653
01:29:28,148 --> 01:29:33,653
It's just something I would do as a kid
on my grandmother's kitchen table.

654
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:36,072
Well, it's nice.

655
01:29:36,156 --> 01:29:38,158
You Catholic?

656
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,662
I used to be.

657
01:29:44,122 --> 01:29:47,292
I was thinkin' about
when they confirmed me.

658
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:50,795
I was eight, and they anointed me
with the holy water.

659
01:29:50,879 --> 01:29:53,047
And I remember...

660
01:29:55,216 --> 01:29:57,802
they told me I was a soldier of Christ.

661
01:30:01,598 --> 01:30:05,435
I guess somewhere along the way
I must have switched units.

662
01:30:07,645 --> 01:30:09,647
It's oil.

663
01:30:11,608 --> 01:30:14,944
They don't use holy water to confirm.
They use oil.

664
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:17,906
I was raised Catholic too.

665
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:20,950
Mission school on the reservation.

666
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:26,164
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us
talking Navajo at Mass.

667
01:30:27,665 --> 01:30:30,126
Of course, one Sunday I forgot.

668
01:30:31,586 --> 01:30:35,673
They punished me by tying me
to the radiator in the basement.

669
01:30:35,757 --> 01:30:37,759
For two days.

670
01:30:39,302 --> 01:30:41,054
I think I was eight too.

671
01:30:41,971 --> 01:30:44,682
Well, they're sure
lettin' you talk Navajo now.

672
01:30:44,766 --> 01:30:46,476
Yeah.

673
01:30:53,316 --> 01:30:58,196
You know, when this is over, maybe
you should come out to Navajo country.

674
01:30:59,113 --> 01:31:02,909
Monument Valley is a beautiful place.
It's peaceful.

675
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:06,829
You know, we could do some things
that you don't do in the Corps.

676
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:12,460
Like ride horses, eat fry bread,
do some hunting...

677
01:31:15,213 --> 01:31:17,215
Horses.

678
01:31:22,303 --> 01:31:25,807
I don't know.
It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.

679
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:29,644
But it might be worth it.
You know, you could meet my son.

680
01:31:30,228 --> 01:31:32,814
And he could meet Joe Enders,

681
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:38,152
the guy who watched
over Daddy's scrawny ass.

682
01:31:42,699 --> 01:31:45,201
You must be a very good father, Ben.

683
01:31:46,994 --> 01:31:51,040
Ben. You know,
you've never called me that before.

684
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,546
Enders.
What kind of name is that anyway?

685
01:31:57,171 --> 01:32:02,677
It's Italian. Used to be Endrolfini before
some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it.

686
01:32:04,846 --> 01:32:08,141
Captain needs to code a message
back to command post.

687
01:32:08,224 --> 01:32:09,767
You the Indian?

688
01:32:09,851 --> 01:32:12,145
Yeah, I'm the Indian.

689
01:32:12,228 --> 01:32:15,606
It's just a few minutes' drive.
We'll get you back in no time.

690
01:32:41,257 --> 01:32:44,969
- I need to speak with you, Gunny.
- Yeah. Give me a second.

691
01:32:45,428 --> 01:32:49,348
Got this with the mail today.
You ever had pickled herring?

692
01:32:51,642 --> 01:32:53,644
I need out.

693
01:32:54,187 --> 01:32:56,731
What the hell are you talkin' about?

694
01:32:56,814 --> 01:32:58,816
This detail.

695
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:01,277
My duty.

696
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,362
I can't do it.

697
01:33:03,905 --> 01:33:06,157
Well, I need you, Enders.

698
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,951
Yeah.
You've been saving a lot of marines.

699
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:17,627
I'm requesting mast with battalion commander.
I want out.

700
01:33:19,045 --> 01:33:23,966
Oh, yeah? You and me and every
other mother's son. We all want out.

701
01:33:24,759 --> 01:33:28,512
Well, as long as there's
a Tojo and a Hitler out there

702
01:33:28,596 --> 01:33:31,682
we have to keep on fighting.
Is that understood?

703
01:33:33,184 --> 01:33:36,395
- You're not hearing me.
- I'm hearing you just fine.

704
01:33:37,188 --> 01:33:39,774
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide,

705
01:33:40,274 --> 01:33:43,694
and it ain't bein' waged
on your wants and wishes.

706
01:33:43,778 --> 01:33:46,447
Now you get some sack time.
That's an order.

707
01:33:46,489 --> 01:33:48,783
Goddamn it!
I can't do it!

708
01:33:49,408 --> 01:33:51,702
I can't perform my duty!

709
01:34:07,176 --> 01:34:09,261
Hey there, sweetheart.

710
01:34:09,345 --> 01:34:11,430
Hi.
It's OK.

711
01:34:12,223 --> 01:34:15,267
You don't have to cry.
You're gonna be all right.

712
01:34:17,853 --> 01:34:19,981
Got a present for you.

713
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,485
This is chocolate.

714
01:34:26,237 --> 01:34:28,990
You see, you eat it... and it's good.

715
01:34:33,786 --> 01:34:35,788
It's good.

716
01:34:36,205 --> 01:34:38,416
You want some?

717
01:34:41,585 --> 01:34:43,587
You'll have to chew it next time.
Here.

718
01:34:55,224 --> 01:34:57,351
Harrigan, go!

719
01:35:07,945 --> 01:35:09,780
Incoming!

720
01:35:18,539 --> 01:35:20,124
Run!

721
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:21,751
Go!
Run!

722
01:35:21,834 --> 01:35:24,003
Harrigan!
Make her run!

723
01:35:25,588 --> 01:35:27,590
Come on!
To me!

724
01:35:45,316 --> 01:35:47,359
Harrigan!

725
01:36:54,134 --> 01:36:56,387
Come on, keep moving!

726
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:22,204
Fall back!

727
01:38:25,058 --> 01:38:27,227
Help!
Help!

728
01:38:43,535 --> 01:38:45,579
I can't let 'em take us.

729
01:38:48,582 --> 01:38:50,876
What are you talking about?

730
01:41:18,732 --> 01:41:20,734
Enders!

731
01:41:21,693 --> 01:41:23,987
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.

732
01:41:27,365 --> 01:41:29,326
Have you seen them?

733
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,496
He's over there.

734
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:37,876
Oh, shit...

735
01:41:57,103 --> 01:42:00,941
This was supposed to be a secured area!
What happened?

736
01:42:04,361 --> 01:42:06,738
I killed him.

737
01:42:07,656 --> 01:42:09,783
You... you what?

738
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:15,455
I took my grenade and...
and I threw it and I blew him up.

739
01:42:23,964 --> 01:42:26,299
What the hell is wrong with you?

740
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:30,053
Yahzee!

741
01:42:30,345 --> 01:42:32,973
Yahzee!
Yahzee, no!

742
01:42:33,515 --> 01:42:34,975
Get up!

743
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:42,774
Come on.
You can do it.

744
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:45,610
- Yahzee.
- Let him go.

745
01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:47,862
Yahzee, no.

746
01:42:49,072 --> 01:42:51,908
Go on. Why can't...
Come on. Do it.

747
01:42:51,992 --> 01:42:53,952
- Do it!
- No.

748
01:43:51,259 --> 01:43:55,055
You know, Whitehorse...
he saved my bacon.

749
01:43:58,933 --> 01:44:02,729
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer
would make of that.

750
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:10,737
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on
the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians,

751
01:44:10,779 --> 01:44:13,948
like he was talkin'
about gophers or somethin'.

752
01:44:15,325 --> 01:44:19,412
About gettin' paid three dollars
per Comanche ear.

753
01:44:21,456 --> 01:44:24,042
I know.
Gets you thinkin'.

754
01:44:25,835 --> 01:44:31,299
Another 50 years, who knows, we could
be sittin' down with the Nipponese.

755
01:44:31,382 --> 01:44:34,677
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit...

756
01:44:36,846 --> 01:44:39,599
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.

757
01:44:42,227 --> 01:44:44,229
You think too much.

758
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:51,986
First time I ever been accused of that.

759
01:45:54,591 --> 01:45:58,386
Thought I told you not to go
traipsing around on your own.

760
01:46:05,226 --> 01:46:10,607
You know, Charlie blessed my son
in the Navajo way the day he was born.

761
01:46:17,572 --> 01:46:20,950
He wondered about cowboys
watching Indians' backs.

762
01:46:21,618 --> 01:46:24,037
Something about it didn't seem right.

763
01:46:24,746 --> 01:46:27,707
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.

764
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:34,213
He didn't even want to come
to this damn war. I talked him into it.

765
01:46:38,384 --> 01:46:40,178
Maybe you made a mistake.

766
01:46:51,606 --> 01:46:53,900
Maybe we all did.

767
01:46:55,068 --> 01:46:56,986
I was following orders, Ben.

768
01:46:58,279 --> 01:47:00,990
My orders were to protect the code.

769
01:47:01,824 --> 01:47:07,455
If one of you got caught, talked,
the code would be useless.

770
01:47:14,962 --> 01:47:17,090
I was following orders, Ben.

771
01:47:20,176 --> 01:47:24,722
Course you were, Joe.
You're a damn good fuckin' marine.

772
01:47:40,196 --> 01:47:42,281
The Viking wants to see you.

773
01:47:43,241 --> 01:47:45,326
He says right away.

774
01:47:52,542 --> 01:47:55,586
I want you to brief everybody,
make clear what's happenin'.

775
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:58,506
All right.
Got no problem with point, Gunny.

776
01:47:58,673 --> 01:48:00,675
- That's good.
- You wanted to see me?

777
01:48:00,758 --> 01:48:02,009
Yeah.

778
01:48:02,093 --> 01:48:06,305
The 8th is moving out already
and we need to be ahead of 'em.

779
01:48:06,347 --> 01:48:10,226
The destination is that big piece of rock
you see over there.

780
01:48:10,309 --> 01:48:13,688
The last defensible ridge on this island.

781
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:18,484
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount,
Saipan is pretty much ours.

782
01:48:22,196 --> 01:48:26,367
Yesterday, bombers
beat the shit out of that rock.

783
01:48:26,659 --> 01:48:30,955
The brass is nervous.
They expected more resistance over there.

784
01:48:31,873 --> 01:48:34,500
Now they want us to go over
and check it out.

785
01:48:35,543 --> 01:48:38,170
So where the hell they got us now?

786
01:48:38,212 --> 01:48:40,172
Goin' up the mountain.

787
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:42,925
Have ourselves a little peek.

788
01:48:45,052 --> 01:48:48,806
That codetalker is out front for a reason.

789
01:48:49,223 --> 01:48:51,726
That's exactly where I need him to be.

790
01:48:52,852 --> 01:48:55,646
If there's still a problem
between the two of you,

791
01:48:55,688 --> 01:48:59,358
I would like to straighten that out,
right here, right now.

792
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:04,030
- No problem here, Gunny.
- That's good.

793
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,949
But there's still one here.

794
01:49:08,451 --> 01:49:11,203
You just do what you're
supposed to do, Sergeant.

795
01:49:11,245 --> 01:49:13,331
Nothing more, nothing less.

796
01:49:19,587 --> 01:49:21,589
Enders.

797
01:49:22,715 --> 01:49:24,967
You got another letter.

798
01:50:30,282 --> 01:50:32,159
Freeze!

799
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:47,091
Jesus Christ!
We're in the middle of a goddamn minefield!

800
01:50:47,133 --> 01:50:49,760
Chick's gonna get us out.
Right, Chick?

801
01:50:50,511 --> 01:50:52,513
Sure I am.

802
01:50:54,181 --> 01:50:56,350
One line after Chick.

803
01:51:01,147 --> 01:51:03,149
Pappas.

804
01:51:05,234 --> 01:51:07,111
Pappas.

805
01:51:08,237 --> 01:51:10,239
Move, Greek.

806
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:13,492
I'm gonna get my fuckin' balls
blown off out here!

807
01:51:20,875 --> 01:51:22,877
Yahzee!
Stop!

808
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:46,942
Move out!

809
01:52:26,565 --> 01:52:28,108
Yahzee!

810
01:52:28,776 --> 01:52:30,069
Hey!

811
01:52:46,293 --> 01:52:48,420
Nice shootin', Pap.

812
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:11,402
The 8th's movin' in.
We'd better check out the other side.

813
01:53:11,443 --> 01:53:13,570
Got it.
You all right?

814
01:53:14,363 --> 01:53:18,200
Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right.
We'll cover you with a 30.

815
01:53:18,283 --> 01:53:19,993
- On it.
- All right?

816
01:53:20,077 --> 01:53:22,246
OK, let's go!

817
01:53:22,496 --> 01:53:23,497
Move!

818
01:53:44,476 --> 01:53:46,728
Hjelmstad!

819
01:53:46,812 --> 01:53:49,148
- Help him up!
- Gunny!

820
01:53:52,693 --> 01:53:54,695
Come on.
Come on.

821
01:54:06,665 --> 01:54:09,459
- Christ.
- Joe! Joe!

822
01:54:11,753 --> 01:54:13,505
Tear him open.

823
01:54:14,506 --> 01:54:16,508
You want morphine?

824
01:54:16,592 --> 01:54:18,343
- You want morphine?
- Yeah.

825
01:54:22,556 --> 01:54:24,641
You'll be all right, sir.

826
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:30,355
Goddamn it, Yahzee, get over here!

827
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:32,649
Fuck!

828
01:54:33,483 --> 01:54:36,653
Chick... Stay with him.

829
01:54:39,114 --> 01:54:40,324
I got ya.

830
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,089
I told you to stay with Gunny.

831
01:56:19,631 --> 01:56:21,550
Gunny's gone.

832
01:56:41,528 --> 01:56:44,573
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we, Joe?

833
01:56:46,116 --> 01:56:48,535
I'm runnin' out of ammo here, Joe.

834
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:54,875
I don't wanna die in this shithole.

835
01:56:58,336 --> 01:57:00,505
You're not gonna die.

836
01:57:03,049 --> 01:57:04,968
Nobody else is gonna die.

837
01:57:14,811 --> 01:57:19,357
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it out of here.

838
01:58:26,383 --> 01:58:30,679
8th's caught out in the open.
We gotta call in the flyboys.

839
01:58:35,058 --> 01:58:37,644
I'm gonna get that radio.
Cover me.

840
01:59:07,132 --> 01:59:09,259
He got the radio, Yahzee!

841
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:42,459
Cover me!
I'm going!

842
01:59:45,962 --> 01:59:48,173
Stay back!

843
02:00:01,394 --> 02:00:02,979
Fuckers!

844
02:00:53,947 --> 02:00:56,407
It won't bring your friends back.

845
02:00:59,452 --> 02:01:01,704
What do you know about friends?

846
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:44,622
Get us some air support!

847
02:01:58,594 --> 02:02:01,723
Bowie White, this is Carson Red, Arizona.

848
02:02:01,764 --> 02:02:04,100
I say again, Carson Red, Arizona.

849
02:02:10,857 --> 02:02:12,692
Coordinates!

850
02:02:12,734 --> 02:02:16,654
Two-twenty, Mike, three-six.

851
02:02:27,707 --> 02:02:29,709
All right, let's go.

852
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:33,546
We're gonna make it outta here.

853
02:03:08,873 --> 02:03:10,875
Damn it, Joe.

854
02:03:13,836 --> 02:03:15,838
Just get it over with.

855
02:03:16,881 --> 02:03:18,883
Shut up, Ben.

856
02:03:38,402 --> 02:03:40,404
Do it, Joe.

857
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:43,783
Do it!

858
02:03:46,536 --> 02:03:48,788
No one else is gonna die, Ben.

859
02:03:52,708 --> 02:03:54,502
No one else is dying.

860
02:05:22,006 --> 02:05:24,008
Joe, we did it.

861
02:05:25,593 --> 02:05:27,428
God...

862
02:05:28,304 --> 02:05:30,014
God!

863
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:33,559
Oh, God... Oh, Joe...

864
02:05:48,741 --> 02:05:51,368
We saved a lot of marines today.

865
02:05:55,331 --> 02:05:57,416
Yeah, we did, Ben.

866
02:06:03,672 --> 02:06:05,591
Charlie...

867
02:06:05,925 --> 02:06:08,302
You know I didn't want to.

868
02:06:11,347 --> 02:06:13,140
Right?

869
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:26,654
Hail... Hail Mary...

870
02:06:26,695 --> 02:06:28,364
full of grace...

871
02:06:28,445 --> 02:06:29,825
our...

872
02:06:30,490 --> 02:06:32,785
our Lord is with thee...

873
02:06:41,545 --> 02:06:44,670
Holy Mary, mother of God...

874
02:06:46,215 --> 02:06:48,215
pray for us...

875
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:59,185
I got the last of 'em, Joe.

876
02:08:27,275 --> 02:08:29,525
His name was Joe Enders...

877
02:08:30,150 --> 02:08:32,445
from South Philadelphia.

878
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:35,365
He was a fierce warrior.

879
02:08:37,115 --> 02:08:39,120
A good marine.

880
02:08:49,005 --> 02:08:52,340
If you ever tell a story about him,
George...

881
02:08:53,925 --> 02:08:56,135
say he was my friend.

882
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,146
