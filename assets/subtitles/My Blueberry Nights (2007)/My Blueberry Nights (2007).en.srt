1
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,715
Hello? Who!?

2
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,848
No. I'm sorry,
I don't know anyone by that name

3
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,112
No, listen,
I get about a hundred customers a night.

4
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,684
I can't keep track of them all.

5
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,653
Do you know...
well tell me what he likes to eat

6
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:33,981
Cause I remember people
by what they order.

7
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,124
Not by their names.

8
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,024
"Meat Loaf? "

9
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,962
Well, I know a Meat Loaf
with Mashed Potatoes.

10
00:01:40,963 --> 00:01:42,531
I know Meat Loaf who likes

11
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,398
Well, with Cheese Fries,
Pouched Egg, Onion Rings.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,865
What? He doesn't like potatoes?

13
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,442
Why don't you, well,
yeah give me your number

14
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,306
And if I see him, I'll
tell him to call you

15
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,146
Yeah, I promise. I will. Ok bye.

16
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,552
He's 5'11 with dark brown hair.

17
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,349
Sorry, I can't think of any Meat Loafs
with Cheese Fries

18
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,253
or Onion Rings or Pouched Eggs.

19
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,757
Or Fried Fillet of Fish
that match that description.

20
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,221
Last time we were here,
I think he had the pork chops.

21
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,621
Oh why didn't you say so?

22
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,435
That's because we supposedly
have the best pork chops in the city.

23
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,226
You ever tried them?

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,232
No, I haven't.

25
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,269
Why not?
What, are you religious or something?

26
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,139
Listen, have you seen him or not?

27
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,207
5'11 ". Dark brown hair. Pork chops

28
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,348
I have actually.
He came in here for dinner last night.

29
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,514
He ordered two pork chops.

30
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,276
One with mashed potatoes and
one with string beans.

31
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,482
I guess he was hungry.

32
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,122
No, he didn't eat both of them.

33
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,293
Our portions are too big
for a person to eat two

34
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,687
No, one was for him and one was
for his girlfriend

35
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,325
Look! Just get to the point...

36
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,327
Don't... Don't change the subject!

37
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,868
Are you seeing someone else?

38
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,162
Who is she?

39
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,844
I hope you both drop dead!

40
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,162
If someone comes in here looking for me

41
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,527
give him these keys.

42
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:23,998
What do I tell him?

43
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,499
Tell him he's an asshole!

44
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:31,869
Taxi!

45
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,193
Hey, did he pick up the keys?

46
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,199
No, not yet

47
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,715
Do you have an extra cigarette?

48
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:12,851
Sure.

49
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,315
Rolled it myself.

50
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,420
Thanks.

51
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,557
You okay?

52
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,099
Yeah.

53
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,467
I haven't had one in a while

54
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,367
I only smoke when I get stressed out.

55
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,439
Well, you shouldn't worry so much.

56
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,276
That way you'll avoid lung cancer.

57
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,110
Do you think she's pretty?

58
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:44,876
Who?

59
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,346
The girl he was in here with.

60
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,618
Oh, she was okay I guess... I mean.

61
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,189
Not the type I would prefer
to have my pork chops with

62
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,360
but "each man to his own", right?

63
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,628
Yeah right.

64
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,233
Hello.

65
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,494
Hey.

66
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,671
I need someone to talk to.

67
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,177
Do you think he'll pick up the keys?

68
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,780
I don't know

69
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,420
I've had customers
leaving keys here for years.

70
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,182
Sometimes they pick
them up in a few days.

71
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,553
Sometimes it takes a few weeks.

72
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,529
Well, what about most of the time?

73
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,392
Most of the time, the
keys stay in the jar.

74
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,306
Well why do you keep them?

75
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,799
You should just throw them out.

76
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:17,998
No.

77
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,836
No I couldn't do that.

78
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,506
Why not?

79
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,079
If I threw these keys away

80
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,083
then those doors will be closed forever.

81
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,879
And that shouldn't be up to me to decide.

82
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,383
Should it?

83
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,931
Guess I'm just looking for a reason.

84
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,636
Well, from my observations

85
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,703
sometimes it's better off not knowing

86
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:54,172
and other times there's
no reason to be found.

87
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,075
Everything has a reason.

88
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,510
It's like these pies and cakes.

89
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,755
At the end of every night

90
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,817
the cheesecake and the apple pie
are always completely gone.

91
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,358
The peach cobbler

92
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,460
and the chocolate mousse cake
are nearly finished.

93
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,501
But there's always a whole
blueberry pie left untouched.

94
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,236
So what's wrong with the blueberry pie?

95
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,136
There's nothing's wrong
with the blueberry pie.

96
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,433
It's just people make other choices.

97
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,075
You can't blame the blueberry pie.

98
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,074
It's just no one wants it.

99
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,205
Wait!

100
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,382
I want a piece.

101
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,678
With ice cream?

102
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,892
Leave it to me.

103
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,155
Here we go.

104
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,229
I hope you enjoy it.

105
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,300
Thanks.

106
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,177
It's not bad.

107
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,321
Really?

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,218
You should try some.

109
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,056
No, I'm alright. I have my own.

110
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,613
Will you tell me the stories
behind those other keys?

111
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,857
What for?

112
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,689
I just wondered how
they all ended up here.

113
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,667
Pick one.

114
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,804
Those belonged to a young
couple a few years ago.

115
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,170
They were naive enough to believe

116
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,310
that they were gonna spend the
rest of their lives together.

117
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,908
Well, what happened?

118
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,981
Life happened.

119
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,649
Things happened. Yeah, time happened.

120
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,655
It's pretty much always
the case more or less.

121
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,189
Or maybe one of them ran off
with someone else.

122
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,261
Maybe the feelings just went away.

123
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,099
What about these?

124
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,008
Those belonged to a little old lady

125
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,369
Her best friend would pick them up
and come to visit her.

126
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,239
She dropped them off
and I never saw her again.

127
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,674
I presumed, I mean, she was pretty old.

128
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,406
I presumed she passed away or something.

129
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,053
What about these?

130
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,319
These keys used to
belong to a young lad

131
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,485
from Manchester England

132
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,765
who made plans and had dreams

133
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,729
of running every
marathon in this country

134
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,296
starting in New York.

135
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,406
He was going to write a journal
about his experiences

136
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,607
and ended up running a cafe.

137
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,146
Later they were given to a Russian girl

138
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,613
who loved collecting keys

139
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,017
and watching sunsets.

140
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,557
Unfortunately,
she loved sunsets more than the keys

141
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,416
and ended up disappearing into one.

142
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,921
Why didn't you go looking for her?

143
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,594
When I was little

144
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,102
me mum used to take me to the park
on weekends

145
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,305
She said if I ever got lost.

146
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,209
I had to stay in one place
so that she'd find me.

147
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,445
Does that work?

148
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,343
Not really.

149
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,276
She got lost once looking for me.

150
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,477
Eh, you want some more ice cream?

151
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,750
No thanks.

152
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:31,752
You sure?

153
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,185
Yeah I'm fine. Thanks.

154
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,534
You're late.

155
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,365
Same as usual?

156
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,676
No thanks.

157
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,724
Can I have my keys back?

158
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,227
Yeah, sure.

159
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,522
So...

160
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,134
You two have patched things up then?

161
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,539
Thanks.

162
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,405
Lousy bloody camera.

163
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,145
Hey!

164
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,941
Alright. Come on. Break it... Alright!

165
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,981
Take it outside. Take it out...

166
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:40,775
None of your business cupcake!

167
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:41,848
Don't start with me mate!

168
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,452
Don't you start... Come here!

169
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,620
Right you come here

170
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,184
Get out of my place!

171
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,921
Don't start with me!

172
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,026
Get out!

173
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,857
Hey you haven't paid yet!

174
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,248
Can I have a tissue?

175
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,320
What happened?

176
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,655
Did he hit you?

177
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,826
No!

178
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,218
Well what?

179
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,462
I got mugged on the subway.

180
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,966
I thought Pork Chop lived around here?

181
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,628
He does.

182
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,834
What were you doing on the subway?

183
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,031
Well...

184
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,205
I just needed some
time to prepare myself.

185
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,439
I was gonna get off in a few stops.

186
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,076
I don't know, I just.

187
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,115
The next thing I knew,
I ended up in the Bronx.

188
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,419
That's a very interesting
way to prepare yourself

189
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,721
I've never been very
good at confrontation

190
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,162
Some people enjoy it.

191
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,161
Not me.

192
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,400
Hey, are you alright?

193
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,974
Should we call the police or something?

194
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,280
No.

195
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,946
No, he didn't get away with very much.

196
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,689
Especially after I
kicked him in the balls.

197
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,681
You didn't.

198
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,064
Wait, what happened to you?

199
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,001
I ate too much chocolate .

200
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,849
What's wrong with your camera?

201
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,145
Oh, I don't know.

202
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,447
It's been in a lousy
mood these past few days.

203
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,860
It doesn't really keep
people from stealing, does it?

204
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,094
No.

205
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,858
Not really.

206
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,194
But I like having it around, 'cause

207
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,200
for me it's like my diary.

208
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,638
You know?

209
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,911
Some nights, I watch the tapes back and

210
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,877
I'm amazed at how much I've missed.

211
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,883
That's going on right in front of me.

212
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,790
You must have a lot of tapes.

213
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,591
I don't keep them all.

214
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,097
I'm not that weird.

215
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,404
Only the highlights

216
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,676
Can I take a look?

217
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,851
Sure.

218
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,177
Come around.

219
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,370
She left behind her set of keys
and disappeared that night.

220
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,583
How do you say goodbye to someone
you can't imagine living without?

221
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,678
I didn't say goodbye.

222
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,350
I didn't say anything.

223
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,331
I just walked away.

224
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,403
At the end of that night.

225
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,437
I decided to take the longest way
to cross the street.

226
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,981
Dear Jeremy.

227
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,818
As you can see by this postcard

228
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,545
I'm now in Memphis, Tennessee.

229
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,190
Hey Lizzy, hurry up with
those damn pick-ups will ya!

230
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,849
Coming!

231
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:42,617
Come on hustle it!

232
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,953
It took me a long time to get here

233
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,356
And I'm not sure how
long I'll be staying

234
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,061
During the day, I work
at a diner downtown

235
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,965
I haven't been able to sleep at night

236
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,175
so I've also taken a
waitressing job at a bar

237
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,503
It's kind of a dive,
but the tips are pretty good

238
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,141
Working two jobs is exhausting

239
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,313
But at least it keeps me busy

240
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,448
and most importantly,
it keeps my mind away from him

241
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:43,844
Hi girl

242
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,987
Hey Sandy

243
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,655
You going home?

244
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,652
Let me put it this way

245
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:50,793
I'm getting up out of here

246
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,364
I wish I could go

247
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,893
What's wrong?

248
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,295
That guy at the bar

249
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,463
I don't think he's ever gonna leave

250
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,830
Oh you're talking about Arnie?

251
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,006
Child, don't worry about him.

252
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,070
He probably just lost track of time

253
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,403
But now if you need to get going

254
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,510
You just bring his check to him,
have him sign it

255
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,041
Travis runs a tab for him

256
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,847
Well, does he always stay this late?

257
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,749
Always

258
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,949
You stick around here
you see for yourself

259
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,519
Have a good night darlin'

260
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,281
You too. Good night

261
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,500
Here's your check

262
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,520
Just eight?

263
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,991
I coulda sworn I had at least nine

264
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,429
No, just eight

265
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,997
Do you have a pen?

266
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,825
Yeah

267
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,500
I don't recognize you

268
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,200
You new around here or something?

269
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,809
I just started a few nights ago

270
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,271
Oh

271
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,454
Have you got a name?

272
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,778
Lizzie

273
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,285
Lizzie

274
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,195
Well, it's been a pleasure getting
to know you Lizzie

275
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,162
What do you mean?

276
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,802
You won't be seeing much more of me
from now on

277
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,297
Why's that?

278
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,743
Well I don't have much reason
to come back here anymore

279
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,676
Tonight was my last night of drinking

280
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,881
Oh

281
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,548
Yeah

282
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,619
So, you just give that to Travis

283
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,863
Tell him I'll cut him a check

284
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,367
Ok

285
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:16,866
That's for you

286
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:18,968
Thank you

287
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,714
Bye

288
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,227
Oh, hi

289
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,632
Do you have a twin sister?

290
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:45,968
No

291
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:47,961
I wish I did

292
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,766
Yeah? Well, I'm glad I don't have a twin

293
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,340
One of me's plenty

294
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,213
Well, let's see I'm just gonna
have the chicken fried steak

295
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,518
and a side of string beans

296
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,308
Ok

297
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:03,945
Coming right up

298
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,124
Hey! Knock that crap off over there!

299
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,693
This is a restaurant,
not a damn dancehall!

300
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,739
How come you're working so hard, Lizzie?

301
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,802
I'm trying to save up for a car

302
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:29,841
Where are you going?

303
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,581
Well, I don't have any specific
destination in mind, but

304
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,720
I'm just gonna go until
I run out of places to go

305
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,717
I wish I could do that

306
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,016
Here's your change

307
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,783
You put that towards a Buick

308
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,428
Thank you

309
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,236
Hi

310
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,502
Wait what are you doing here?

311
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,196
What?

312
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,599
What are you doing here?

313
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,431
Oh, I'm celebrating

314
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,068
What are you celebrating?

315
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,972
My last night of drinking!

316
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,310
He's not giving you a hard time, is he?

317
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,946
I think he just wants to talk

318
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,779
That's funny,
'cause he almost never wants to talk

319
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,348
He's not hitting on you, is he?

320
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,289
No. I don't think it's like that

321
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:19,960
It's too bad

322
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,359
Be nice to see him take
an interest in a woman

323
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,429
I thought he was married

324
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:27,160
Yeah, that's precisely the problem.
He still thinks he is

325
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,708
Holy shit

326
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,958
Travis, how's it hanging?

327
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,129
Always a pleasure, Sue Lynne

328
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,858
You always say that to me

329
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,394
and I never know whether you mean it

330
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,435
I'm just dropping in
to use the ladies' room

331
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,538
Do I have to buy a beer first?

332
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,004
Your money's no good here, Sue Lynne

333
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,310
Have you got a moment?

334
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,138
I got nothing to say to you

335
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,665
Arnie?

336
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,806
Arnie?

337
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,375
Yeah?

338
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,225
I know its none of my business

339
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,757
but have you ever thought
about cutting back.

340
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,898
Have I thought about it?

341
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,247
What are these?

342
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,756
A group I go to sometimes, Lizzie,

343
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,388
has this system.

344
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,497
After a meeting,

345
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,939
they invite the new
people to come down and

346
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,536
pick up a white chip.

347
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,747
You take it as a
symbol of your intention

348
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,853
to stay sober.

349
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,860
And if you

350
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,130
slip up and drink again

351
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,563
you got to come back
and pick up another chip.

352
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,681
This one is for ninety days.

353
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,878
I got that far.

354
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,219
Once.

355
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,866
See all those white chips, Lizzie?

356
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,905
I am the king of the white chip.

357
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,579
Dear Jeremy.

358
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,809
I thought about what Arnie
said about the sobriety chips,

359
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,146
how to focus your
attention on something else

360
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,222
in order to cure your addiction.

361
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,565
If I was an addict, I'd choose
blueberry pie as my chip.

362
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,463
Writing to your boyfriend?

363
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,934
No, just someone I know.

364
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,809
Why not pick up the phone?

365
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,076
Some things are better on paper.

366
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,216
Oh you think so?

367
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,828
What are you doing?

368
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,206
Well, you know

369
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,704
I listened to what
you said the other day.

370
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:10,105
So I'm trying to write
a letter to my wife.

371
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,549
We don't talk to each
other much anymore

372
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,846
so I thought maybe I'd try your method.

373
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:48,815
Randy!

374
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:50,911
Oh my God!

375
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:06,826
Arnie! Arnie! Stop! Arnie!

376
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,316
Okay I got. Easy now, watch your back.

377
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,345
You'll be alright, man!

378
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,268
Hello, is that the
Memphis Bar and Grill?

379
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,300
It is! Great.

380
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,701
Listen, I wonder if you
could help me please.

381
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,001
I'm looking for a young
woman called Elizabeth.

382
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,211
Yes. I realize that. I'm not
calling to order your food.

383
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,411
I'm sure it's delicious.

384
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,448
I wonder, does a woman
called Elizabeth work there?

385
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,777
Elizabeth!

386
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,948
Elizabeth.

387
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,314
That's what I said, Elizabeth.

388
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,251
E- L-I-Z-A-B-

389
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,718
No, alright, thank you.

390
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:03,655
Thank you.

391
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,093
Good God, it's Jeremy!

392
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,094
Yeah it's me!

393
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,060
I never thought I'd
hear your voice again.

394
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,259
Well, you see I got your postcard and...

395
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,765
This sounds ridiculous but...

396
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,269
Well I traced every
Memphis bar and grill.

397
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,663
There must be at least ninety.

398
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,374
I know its crazy and...

399
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,306
I just wanted to say
thanks for staying in touch.

400
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,174
I miss you. I miss your company.

401
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,540
I never thought I'd
hear from you again!

402
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,979
It's not really you is it?

403
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,013
No I know you don't know me.

404
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,349
But your name's Elizabeth.

405
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,227
Well, I just... I just wanted

406
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,059
I just wanted to say
hello really, and...

407
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,763
I wanted to speak to my friend.

408
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:43,797
Yeah.

409
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,595
No no, I don't want to
order any fried chicken.

410
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,531
Thanks.

411
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,804
Thanks for listening.

412
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:52,976
Bye.

413
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,709
Goddamn son of a bitch...

414
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,942
I need to talk to you!

415
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,209
Not in here. Let's take this outside.

416
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,014
No! I want to talk about it right here!

417
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,850
So you feel more like a man now do you?

418
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,588
You feel all big and strong.

419
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,360
I mean you could have killed him!

420
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,794
Yeah, no body ever said sleeping
with someone else's wife

421
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,099
was a safe vocation.

422
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,233
Oh goddammit Arnie!

423
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,335
We're, we're separated!

424
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,835
I don't live with you anymore!

425
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,073
I don't talk to you anymore!

426
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,637
You are my goddamn wife!

427
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,345
And I am still your goddamn husband!

428
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,572
No, no you're not...

429
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:32,908
Not anymore.

430
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,916
Well then what am I?

431
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,685
You're nothing.

432
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,447
Nothing to me.

433
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,587
Sue Lynne, please, please, please baby.

434
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,795
Don't do this, don't do this to me.

435
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,828
I love you, I love you so much.

436
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,565
I just, I just need a little more time.

437
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,495
Goddammit Arnie!

438
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,205
No, no you gotta let me go.

439
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,067
I can't do it anymore.
You gotta let me go now.

440
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,433
I'm gonna go, I'm restart my life

441
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,542
and I'm gonna get me a job.

442
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,180
You're gonna get a job, right?

443
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,380
Yes I am.

444
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,174
You don't need a job...

445
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,383
What with all those
boyfriends of yours.

446
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,980
All you gotta do is
just start charging.

447
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,256
You bastard!

448
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,989
YOU GODDAMN BASTARD!

449
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,559
You bastard Arnie!

450
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,990
I'm through with you!

451
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,799
You hear me? I'm through!

452
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,403
I'm through with you!
It is over! It is over!

453
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,136
You understand me?

454
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,248
Sue Lynne,

455
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,818
I swear to god,
if you walk out of here,

456
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,554
I'll kill you.

457
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,563
Then what?

458
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,574
Arnie, be calm now...

459
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,537
you don't want to do this.

460
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,310
It's over!

461
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,793
It's too much.

462
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,123
Nuh uh.

463
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,166
No no no...

464
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:46,003
You're saving up to buy a car, right?

465
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,340
Well, I... I don't want you
driving around in some

466
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,176
junker.

467
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,279
So some cop can pull you over
for a failed inspection.

468
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,186
Thank you.

469
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:44,892
Wait.

470
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,631
You forgot these.

471
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,579
Yeah... you can just get rid of those.

472
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,044
The police said it was an accident.

473
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,344
He couldn't see where he was going

474
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,084
and he skidded off the road.

475
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,210
Can you give me a vodka?

476
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,399
This is my first drink in six years.

477
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,130
Haven't touched the stuff for six years.

478
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,745
Hey everybody!

479
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,012
Let's all drink to Arnie Copeland.

480
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,425
He was guardian of our highways

481
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,790
and defender of our freedom!

482
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:39,303
Well, this stuff tastes
pretty darn awful.

483
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,706
But I guess nobody drinks
it for the taste, right?

484
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,911
Give me another one.

485
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,908
Cheeseburgers?

486
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,684
Whiskey?

487
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,717
This isn't mine.

488
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,758
It's Arnie's tab.

489
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,978
What am I supposed to do with this?

490
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,477
Put it in a frame and hang it on my wall?

491
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,589
Travis wants you to settle it.

492
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,960
Travis!

493
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,597
What are you giving this to me for!?

494
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,097
This is Arnie's tab, not mine!

495
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,107
Why are you giving this to me!?

496
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,571
He was your husband.

497
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,640
Or does that matter at all?

498
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,745
He's dead!

499
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,342
So if you want your money,
you better call his lawyer.

500
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,154
Don't give this to me!

501
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,654
Oh God, what a piece of work you are...

502
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,520
God only knows what Arnie saw in you.

503
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,659
I hate you Travis!

504
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,959
I hate you...

505
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:24,873
Lizzie!

506
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,871
Make sure she gets home safe.

507
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,202
Go on now.

508
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:29,769
Go on!

509
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,759
Hey Sue Lynne?

510
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,694
Sue Lynne?

511
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,166
It's late.

512
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,438
Come on let me take you home.

513
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,255
I was

514
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,430
seventeen when he pulled me over.

515
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,428
High as a kite.

516
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,564
"You been drinking, Miss? "

517
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,138
So I smiled.

518
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,949
Bat my eyes.

519
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,149
Who'd have thought we'd be married.

520
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,557
In love with a cop,

521
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,055
and stuck in this godforesaken town.

522
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,765
He was so crazy about me.

523
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,708
I couldn't breathe.

524
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,714
So we tried

525
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,554
drinking our way back into love.

526
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,925
But it never made sense in the morning.

527
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,427
So I ran.

528
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,636
And every time I came back,

529
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,576
he was here.

530
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,638
And he was still crazy about me.

531
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,353
You know,

532
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:58,457
I used to daydream about him dying.

533
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,090
I thought it was the

534
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,102
only way I'd get clear of him.

535
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,879
You must have hated him.

536
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,182
I didn't hate him.

537
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,190
I just wanted him to

538
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,154
let go of me.

539
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,264
And...

540
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,764
now that he has,

541
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,109
it hurts me more than

542
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,210
anything else in the whole world.

543
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,026
This is where we met.

544
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,214
Right here.

545
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,135
Well, I heard you had a day job

546
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,311
I'm saving for a car

547
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:36,143
Well, I'm leaving town for good so

548
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,520
I wanted to take care of a few things

549
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:42,088
Arnie's tab came out to eight hundred dollars

550
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,128
I guess you can give it to Travis and

551
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,762
he can mark the debt paid

552
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,197
I'll give it to Travis tonight

553
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,462
Shock might give him a heart attack

554
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,312
I have a favor to ask you

555
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,757
Could you keep his bill hanging?

556
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,098
So they don't forget him too soon?

557
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:28,601
OK

558
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:02,764
I guess for Sue Lynne,
leaving this town was like dying

559
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,203
I wonder how people
would remember Arnie

560
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,477
When you're gone,
all that's left behind are the memories

561
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,581
you created in other people's lives

562
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,620
or just a couple of items on a bill

563
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,933
I began receiving postcards
from her regularly

564
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:38,135
Instead of calling strangers,
I decided to change my strategy

565
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,310
It was tiring writing the
same words over and over again

566
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,708
but all worth it
if only one of them reached her

567
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,393
I always had the feeling
I could say anything to you.

568
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,663
Enclosed is a bill I've created for you

569
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,706
in memory of our time together

570
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,476
I wonder how you remember me

571
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,909
As the girl who liked blueberry pies

572
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,524
or the girl with the broken heart?

573
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,742
Still rolling your own cigarettes?

574
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:02,651
You want one?

575
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,553
Yeah

576
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,235
Tastes different

577
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,600
It's probably just been
in my pocket too long

578
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,510
It's a shame you can't
smoke in cafes anymore

579
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,511
You can't smoke anywhere anymore

580
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,320
You should've changed the place

581
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,988
It's not that much different

582
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,258
I've been meaning to buy new chairs

583
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,983
but I couldn't never
find any that match

584
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,456
the tables and the tiles

585
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,559
Shouldn't be hard

586
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,064
Maybe you're just looking
in the wrong places or

587
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,599
maybe you're just sentimental

588
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,575
You look lovely

589
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,812
I'm starting to look like my mom

590
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,571
It's better than looking like your dad

591
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,043
I've seen photos of him

592
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,689
You still have the keys?

593
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,797
Yeah... I always remember what you said

594
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,093
about never throwing
them away, about never

595
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,303
closing those doors forever. I remember

596
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,132
Sometimes, even if you have the keys

597
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,708
those doors still

598
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,408
can't be opened, can they?

599
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,382
Even if the door is open

600
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,112
the person you're looking
for may not be there, Katya

601
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,894
A few years ago, I had a dream

602
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,328
It began in the summer

603
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,934
and was over by the following spring

604
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,835
In between, there was
as many unhappy nights

605
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,577
as there were happy days

606
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,443
Most of them took place in this cafe

607
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,884
And then one night

608
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,214
a door slammed and the dream was over

609
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,468
I should be going

610
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,574
I have to catch a flight in the morning

611
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,480
Thanks for the smoke.

612
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,154
You know,
I didn't even think you'd still be here

613
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,285
Why'd you come?

614
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,891
I guess I just wanted to see
if I could remember

615
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,061
what it felt like

616
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:22,809
Goodbye, Jeremy

617
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,687
Bye, Katya

618
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,144
Cocktails?

619
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,537
A screwdriver, please

620
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:52,475
Here you go

621
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,910
Dear Jeremy

622
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,814
I've always been
fascinated by card players

623
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:02,057
They risk everything on
their instincts and their luck

624
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,918
I wonder if I would be
able to make the same moves

625
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,560
in their position

626
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,628
Or would I just fold?

627
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,670
Sweetheart, do you mind?

628
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,566
Uh-oh look at that

629
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,602
She gets another one this kid

630
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:23,903
You know Leslie you got that fancy Jag

631
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,645
you working on a Rolls Royce now?

632
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,448
Aloha, you forgot to tip the waitress

633
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,447
Actually I didn't forget dick

634
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:33,687
Because I never tip

635
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,447
What do you mean you never tip?

636
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:37,090
I mean Harlan can afford
to pay his own people

637
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,155
I don't know why I have to

638
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,828
You can be cheap or you can be lucky

639
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,623
but you can't be both.
Not in the long run

640
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,389
Here ya go, toots

641
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,192
That is from Mr. Aloha over there

642
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,900
He's gonna pay me back,
he doesn't know it yet

643
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:51,770
Thanks

644
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,532
Your luck just went south

645
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,038
Who's blinds?

646
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:01,042
Working long hours in the casino
makes you lose track of the time

647
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:05,412
And I'm never sure
whether it's day or night

648
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:10,555
But at least I don't have to worry
about my sleeping problem anymore

649
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,260
Somehow it's gone away

650
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,634
How much you got left, sweet cheeks?

651
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:26,900
Because that's what I bet

652
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,441
Eighteen-twenty

653
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,083
You on a big draw, Aloha?

654
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,885
Because otherwise
you're just about dead

655
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,062
You are on a big draw

656
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,026
Twelve outs twice

657
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:56,665
You wanna do business?

658
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:57,997
Make me an offer

659
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,300
How about you take six
hundred and I take a thousand

660
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:01,870
and we gamble for the rest?

661
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,207
I say I need more than that

662
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,573
Doesn't seem fair to you?

663
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:06,782
I feel like gambling

664
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,176
So what do you want me to do?

665
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,846
You heard the man.

666
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,921
He wants to gamble. Deal

667
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,950
Bet you wish you took that
six hundred now,huh Aloha?

668
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,697
Don't get too cocky little girl

669
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,389
Five of hearts still in that deck

670
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,826
Oh come on

671
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,733
We can all dream, Aloha

672
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:31,400
I wish you luck

673
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:33,504
Why don't you deal the card?

674
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:34,472
Fine

675
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,945
Wait, wait, how did you do that?

676
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,016
Ok I swear I wasn't cheating

677
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:44,512
I had the deck in my hand

678
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,783
Pass it to the sugardaddy here

679
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:49,984
I'm telling my grandkids about that one

680
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,996
Maybe

681
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,366
A salad. That'd be healthy, right?

682
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,695
I don't think I could get it down though

683
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,498
All that chewing and swallowing

684
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,604
Maybe I'll get some eggs

685
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,673
Protein, right?

686
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:12,972
How would you like them?

687
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,412
Tied in a knot and nailed to the floor

688
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,015
Or maybe you can just
crack 'em over my head

689
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,014
and let 'em trickle down my cheeks

690
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:24,753
Beth

691
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,526
Why don't I just go ask them right now?

692
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,637
So who is gonna lend me a grand
so I can get back in?

693
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,005
Sam, come on, this is
me we're talking about

694
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:44,179
Why can't you just advance me the cash

695
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:47,211
and I will wire you back the money
within 24 hours

696
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,611
You won't even have a chance to miss it

697
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,146
Yeah?

698
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,284
Well fuck you very much!

699
01:04:58,761 --> 01:04:59,989
Rough night, huh?

700
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,493
You could say that

701
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,896
How did you wind up in this hellhole?

702
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,797
The bus just dropped me off here

703
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:09,868
Where'd you come from?

704
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:10,970
New York

705
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,869
You came all the way here
from New York on a bus?

706
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,671
Sounds awful

707
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,243
Actually, I was on quite a few of them

708
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,144
You must love buses

709
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,586
I wanna get a car but

710
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,917
it's not easy saving money

711
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,988
How much you got?

712
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,920
About twenty-one, twenty-two hundred

713
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,259
Hey Beth

714
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,238
I've got a proposition for you

715
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:44,996
What kind of proposition?

716
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:46,966
See, I need a stake

717
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,971
There's a man I could call in Vegas

718
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,179
but I don't want to do that

719
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,378
I'm gonna win that game

720
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,710
I'm a stronger player than any of them

721
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,683
If you give me a chance
I'm gonna clean their clocks.

722
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,360
How much do you need?

723
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,486
Well your twenty two hundred
would get me back in

724
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,692
And then, once I cash out

725
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,769
you'll get your money back plus a third
of my winnings

726
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:17,771
But what if you lose?

727
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:23,778
If I lose, you get my car

728
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,274
It's a brand new Jag

729
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:27,812
This way

730
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,276
whatever happens

731
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,884
you've got your ass covered
from here to Houston

732
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,123
You got to give me a minute here

733
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,094
It's been a long night

734
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,761
I got an empty stomach.
Just give me a minute

735
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,332
You take your time

736
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,040
I wouldn't want you
choking on your food

737
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,704
Shit it's cold!

738
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:56,935
I know

739
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,273
I'll do it

740
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,374
Oh my, look who's back

741
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:39,152
I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas
in that fancy ass Jag of yours

742
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:42,619
I figure why not let you pay for my gas

743
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,382
Gotta raise again

744
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,247
Five hundred

745
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,319
Oh one of these days
one of us is going to have

746
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:18,988
something when you raise!

747
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,525
Listen, why don't you just wink at me
when that happens

748
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,058
so I know, alright?

749
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:13,746
Raise

750
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,012
I'm all in

751
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:27,994
You want to give me a count on that?

752
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,761
Fifteen... Fifteen thirty-five

753
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,299
Too rich for me

754
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,447
I don't know what's worse

755
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,618
That cute smile or that ugly shirt

756
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,385
I'll give you some action

757
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:10,770
Hey

758
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:14,608
Hey, what happened?

759
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,671
The car's yours

760
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,075
You've got to give me a ride though

761
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:33,719
So where we going?

762
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:34,896
Vegas

763
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,066
She said she knew some people
in Vegas who could stake her

764
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,939
get her started again

765
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,266
But she didn't seem
to be in a hurry to get there

766
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,979
Hey Leslie, are you asleep?

767
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,680
No

768
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:04,150
I keep playing old
poker hands in my head

769
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,753
You?

770
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,356
Same

771
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:10,563
Except for the poker

772
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,490
What are you replaying?

773
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,597
Just some stuff that happened back
in New York

774
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,243
Hey, the man you told me about in Vegas

775
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:24,673
that could give you the money

776
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,270
Yeah?

777
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,447
Is he a boyfriend?

778
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,043
No

779
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,546
I haven't had very much
luck with boyfriends

780
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,084
I've had a few but

781
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,849
none that I could ever ask
for anything, let alone money

782
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,824
Now you want to know
who the man in Vegas is

783
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,600
but you're too polite to ask

784
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:48,825
No

785
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,638
It's not important

786
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:54,770
He's my father

787
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,578
Taught me how to play poker

788
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,174
He had me figuring odds
around the same time

789
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,386
other kids were learning how to count

790
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,587
He used to tell people

791
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:09,382
that I thought the number
that came after ten

792
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:10,818
was Jack

793
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:18,132
So I can ask him for
money or anything, but

794
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:21,893
I won't

795
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:38,983
Trust everyone but always cut the cards

796
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,213
Best thing my father ever taught me

797
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,389
You know what that means?

798
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:46,254
It means never trust anybody

799
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,796
If you're so good at reading people

800
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:49,861
Then why did I lose?

801
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:50,999
Yeah

802
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,198
Because you can't always win

803
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,060
You can beat players
but you can't beat luck

804
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,768
Sometimes your rhythm's off

805
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,768
you read the person right
but still do the wrong thing

806
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,011
Because you trust them?

807
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:05,978
Because you can't even trust yourself

808
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:07,849
Shit

809
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,019
Nobody I want to hear from

810
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:12,913
Nobody?

811
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,246
Nobody!

812
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,229
How did you get this number?

813
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,305
You know this is the third time
this month I've have change it?

814
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,277
Just leave me the hell
alone! Stop calling!

815
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,474
Dammit!

816
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,542
Beth, answer it for me

817
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,153
What do you want me to say?

818
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,447
Tell them its the wrong number
and not to call again

819
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:48,588
Okay

820
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,117
Hello?

821
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:53,651
Sorry, you have-

822
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:55,991
From where?

823
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:58,825
Okay

824
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,401
Okay... you sure?

825
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,173
Okay, thank you... bye

826
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,442
It was someone from a hospital in Vegas

827
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,510
They said your dad's there

828
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,109
And they said he's dying

829
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:21,349
Son of a bitch

830
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,416
That man... always dying

831
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:36,529
It's a trick, okay?

832
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,101
He's pulled this on me before

833
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,475
Says he has to see me, he's dying

834
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:42,574
And then

835
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:44,776
you know how many times
I've fallen for that?

836
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,278
But it was someone from the
hospital that called it wasn't him

837
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:48,675
So what Beth?

838
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,615
You think he couldn't pay someone

839
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,444
to make the phone call for him?

840
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,852
I swear, is there
anyone you don't trust?

841
01:14:58,193 --> 01:15:00,889
Well he must really want to see
you to make up a story like that

842
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,355
Geez, you are just
dying to ask me something

843
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:30,382
What?

844
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:31,488
I didn't say anything

845
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,490
You didn't have to. I can read you

846
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,128
I can even guess what you wanna ask

847
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:37,958
You wanna ask

848
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:42,067
"What if he is dying? "
"What if the message is legit? "

849
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:43,371
Well what if he is?

850
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:48,970
The thing is Beth

851
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:50,740
I don't care

852
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,703
He lives, he dies

853
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:54,879
whatever

854
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:57,075
I don't fucking care

855
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:07,959
You're lying

856
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,184
I'm not going in there

857
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,114
What?

858
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,945
I can't. What- what if I go in there

859
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,851
and he's just sitting up in his room

860
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,388
with his dead beat
friends playing gin rummy

861
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:44,894
or, I dunno, detoxing,
getting a mole removed

862
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:46,257
You know it's more serious than that

863
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,560
No, I don't know that and neither do you

864
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,608
Listen, you do me a favor.
You go in there for me

865
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:56,776
Me?

866
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,771
Why me?

867
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:03,176
Because you are safe.
There's no way he can hurt you

868
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,749
Go, c'mon

869
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:14,460
Fine

870
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,737
I am sorry

871
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,101
You know we tried to phone a couple days

872
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,777
but couldn't seem to reach you

873
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,276
He was-

874
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,344
You should've come earlier

875
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,252
He put you up to this!?

876
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:48,894
How much he pay you huh!?

877
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,086
Jesus

878
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:52,327
You're so good at reading people?

879
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,159
Can't you see it in my face!?

880
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,331
Leslie, he's gone!

881
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,544
You're lying

882
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:14,975
Beth

883
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:17,780
I can't give you the car

884
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:21,745
Why?

885
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,356
Because the car

886
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,791
the car belonged to my father

887
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:36,231
Look, he won big one day in a
Hold'em game at the Riviera, and

888
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,507
went out and bought the next day

889
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,334
It was his pride and joy

890
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:48,981
Til one day I stole his keys,
and an hour later I stole his car

891
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,710
I don't know why I did it

892
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,111
Maybe I just

893
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,814
wanted to see what
he would do, you know?

894
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,285
Was he gonna report it?

895
01:19:57,759 --> 01:19:59,727
Get his daughter arrested?

896
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,899
He did something better than that

897
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:09,095
He waited until he found
out where I wound up

898
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:10,462
One morning

899
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,139
a FedEx guy comes
with an envelope for me

900
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,310
Inside the envelope's the title
and registration of the car

901
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,117
Son of a bitch signed it over to me

902
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,145
So

903
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:30,756
I'm gonna drive this
car until it falls apart

904
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:32,357
At least until I do

905
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,201
So what am I supposed to?

906
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,927
Well, Beth

907
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:48,269
I told you I lost everything
back at Harlan's, didn't I?

908
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,534
Yeah

909
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:52,872
Well, that's not
exactly how it went down

910
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:57,175
See, I beat that game on its ass, Beth

911
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,552
I knocked them off their feet

912
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:04,320
The cards turned just like I knew they would

913
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,788
I read the other players just right

914
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,856
I walked away with all their money

915
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,629
So you lied to me

916
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,834
Maybe I didn't want to share

917
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,773
Maybe I just wanted to see how trusting
and gullible you were

918
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:26,971
Maybe I just wanted company. You know?

919
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,943
It's a long ride, Beth

920
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,582
I didn't want to go alone

921
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,920
Can't do it.
Thirty-five hundred's the best I can give ya

922
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,324
Three thousand. That's my top

923
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,930
Can't. Gotta have thirty-five hundred.
Sorry

924
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:20,725
Thirty-two hundred.
Take it or leave it

925
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:21,627
You know what?

926
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,430
I'm sure we can find a better deal
someplace else. Let's go

927
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,832
I don't think you will, ladies.
Suit yourselves

928
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,009
Thank you!

929
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:30,912
Don't look back

930
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,143
Beth, where are you going?

931
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:33,210
I want that car

932
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:34,347
Beth not at that price!

933
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,274
We can get it for three grand
by the time we get to my car

934
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,814
I don't think he's gonna come down

935
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,147
And I think that's the car I want

936
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:46,227
Have you learned nothing
from your time with me?

937
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,263
You have to stop taking
people at their word!

938
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:51,597
Maybe you should start

939
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,768
You're hopeless

940
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,132
You're hopeless too

941
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:16,253
Dear Jeremy

942
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:20,488
In the last few days,
I've been learning how to not trust people

943
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,588
and I'm glad I failed

944
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,666
Sometimes we depend on other people
as a mirror

945
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:38,640
To define us and tell us who we are

946
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:43,646
And each reflection makes me
like myself a little more

947
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:46,520
Elizabeth

948
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,512
Hello, Cafe Klyuch

949
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:56,080
Rent

950
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:42,764
You still open?

951
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,870
No reason for me to
still be here if I wasn't

952
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:50,604
I heard this place has the best coffee
and pie in town

953
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:51,777
Where'd you hear that?

954
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,245
I get around

955
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:58,946
You wanna come inside?

956
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:01,587
It's cold

957
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,853
What are you doing out here?
It's freezing

958
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:06,390
It's a beautiful night.
I wanted to get some fresh air

959
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:09,022
Have a seat

960
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,335
Isn't this reserved?

961
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,230
Reserved for you

962
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:24,741
Want something to eat?

963
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:29,208
Yeah, I'm starving

964
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,713
What's good tonight?

965
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,583
What about a steak?

966
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:36,817
That sounds good

967
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:39,320
Does it come with home fries?

968
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:40,551
Or mashed

969
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,022
They both sound good

970
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:43,895
Half an order of both?

971
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,967
I'll get the home fries with the steak,
medium rare

972
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,329
and a side of mashed potatoes

973
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:51,866
Coming right up

974
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,113
Learning something about me?

975
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,853
There's something different about you

976
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,883
Or maybe it's me that's changed

977
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,162
Where are the keys?

978
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:17,695
You don't keep them anymore?

979
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,694
Been trying to give
them back to their owners

980
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,094
Do you want yours?

981
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:25,966
No. I don't need them anymore

982
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,107
What about your keys?

983
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:33,875
I got rid of them

984
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,241
Good night, Jeremy

985
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:39,646
I'll see you tomorrow

986
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:56,662
You know I came here the night I left

987
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,499
but I didn't make it past the front door

988
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:06,438
I almost walked in but
I knew that if I did

989
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:09,478
I would just be the same old Elizabeth

990
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:12,910
I didn't want to be that person anymore

991
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:28,929
Hope you enjoy it

992
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,379
Are they still left untouched at the end
of the night?

993
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,412
Yep, more or less

994
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:47,478
Then why do you keep making them?

995
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:53,523
Well I always like having one around
just in case

996
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,589
you pop in and fancy a slice

997
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,301
Do you remember that last night
you were here?

998
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,708
When you practically ate an entire pie
all by yourself?

999
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,002
Really?

1000
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,677
I remember getting really drunk and

1001
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:18,713
having a god awful
hangover the next day

1002
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:20,848
Nothing else?

1003
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,958
No, nothing else

1004
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:33,495
Or don't you have a tape I can watch?

1005
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,237
I do... but...

1006
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:39,530
I've watched it so many times

1007
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:41,537
that the picture started fading
to black and white

1008
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:44,208
And now it's completely unwatchable

1009
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:45,505
Must have been an interesting night

1010
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,547
It was

1011
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:55,320
Never seen a girl eat
so much in all my life

1012
01:29:58,493 --> 01:29:59,619
Like this?

1013
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,588
No, it was more like this

1014
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,273
It's good pie

1015
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,726
It took me nearly a year to get here

1016
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:50,070
It wasn't so hard to
cross that street afterall

1017
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:54,837
It all depends on who's waiting for you
on the other side
