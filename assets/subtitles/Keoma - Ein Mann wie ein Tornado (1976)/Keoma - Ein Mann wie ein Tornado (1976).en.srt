3
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,600
Why did you come back?

4
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,000
Why did you come back?

5
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,080
The world keeps going
around and around,

6
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,580
So you'll always end up
in the same place.

7
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Then stay put.

8
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
They were never
really your people.

9
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:58,400
Even though you're in teeth*
you participated* their war,

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,320
..and you won your medals*.
Didn't you?

11
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,520
The only exist for mankind
is to fulfill his destiny.

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,800
why do you wanna change mine?

13
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,280
I didn't want, remember?

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,760
Mommy!

15
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Mommy!

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,760
Mommy!

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,600
I changed destiny
when I decided that you alone..

18
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,680
..to survive that useless massacre.

19
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Or have you forgotten?

20
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,240
Oh you've never
been away so long.

21
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,440
Your memories will let you forget
the deaths that have to be paid.

22
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,080
Aren't you tired of killing?

23
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,120
I have to survive!

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,280
Keoma!

25
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,360
Keoma!

26
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,560
 

27
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,600
Franco Nero in...

28
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,720
<b>KEOMA</b>

29
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Don't touch me Liza!
You're still clean.

30
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,360
You have to save the baby,
You gotta be through with touching me.

31
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,640
What difference does it make?

32
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,760
Where they're taking us,
I'm bound to catch it, sooner or later.

33
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,900
Instead of dragging away the dire*,
why don't we kill 'em right here?

34
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,800
Haven't you ever heard of
Christian charity?

35
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,960
When I'm trying to attract
their attention, jump off and hide.

36
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,260
But "Mat", you can't!

37
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,700
-They'll only kill..
-Sh..sh..sh..

38
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:18,400
Just get ready to act... fast.

39
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,040
One of them is legging
a break forward!

40
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,640
Stop him! Stop him!

41
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,560
No! No!

42
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,640
See how you like this, sweetheart!

43
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,260
Don't touch her!
She's got the plague.

44
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,080
You mind your own
business, stranger!

45
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:47,780
We're taking another
to the old mine,

46
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,360
Where the others are.
It's the best place for 'em.

47
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:53,840
Anyone who tries
to run away gets shot.

48
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,260
That's orders.

49
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:58,920
Why if anyone of them's got back,
they could infect the whole town.

50
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
I never liked people
who talk too much.

51
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Get off your horse!

52
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,280
I said, get off your horse!

53
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,240
Jane! That's isn't clean* enough.

54
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:35,040
Put some line*.
Come on, move, higher, higher...

55
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,880
Not like that.
Like this, like this,...

56
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,040
Hey, mister!
Come on over, and join the fun.

57
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,320
There's everything here
come Wiskey you'll love it.

58
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,520
We can all what
she's gonna do a man.

59
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,280
The town is a dying up flies.

60
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,800
Give us something to drink.

61
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,520
Hey..
Hey, that's Farrow's wife.

62
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
What the hell is SHE doing here?

63
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,920
She has got the plague.
Oh my God, gather around!

64
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,040
Don't touch,
She's got the plague!

65
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,540
Throw her out!
Before we all get it.

66
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,000
I told you to give us
something to drink.

67
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,720
You get that woman,
out of here!

68
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,960
The lady's with me.

69
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
Drop it!

70
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:03,160
And now, unloaded!

71
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,800
You forgot one.

72
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,820
The lady will have
dinner in her room.

73
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,920
But, we don't have
any room, sir!

74
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,200
They're all taken.

75
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,480
You...

76
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,340
-Your room number?
-Number seven

77
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:09,240
-Get the key!
-But...

78
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
He's trying to get away.

79
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,600
Help with the back,
hurry up, carry* him off.

80
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,360
Hurry up!
Get him! Get him!

81
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,880
There he goes.
Come on, go after him!

82
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,520
What's happened to this town?

83
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,280
How did you get like this?

84
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,640
It was... just after the war.

85
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,160
With all those
ex-soldiers came to town.

86
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,160
They would led by this Caldwell.

87
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,080
He bought the mine.
Then, little by little, whole town.

88
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,520
He forced people to sell.

89
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,600
Using any method he could.

90
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Then the plague began...

91
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,160
Because of the poluted wells.

92
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,600
Now Caldwell won't let
anyone leave town..

93
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,600
..unless they're
sick or dying.

94
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,320
Why are you helping me?

95
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,680
We all have the right to be born.

96
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,560
Your shootings are good..

97
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,560
..at the dead.

98
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,920
Let's go boys! Go!

99
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,880
George!

100
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,400
Say that again!

101
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,000
George.

102
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,840
I haven't heard that
for a long time.

103
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,320
I almost forgot
what it sounded like.

104
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,520
What happened to your bow?

105
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,220
They went like all the things
have belonged to a drunk.

106
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,320
I hocked it for some booze.

107
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,000
But you were
never drinking man!

108
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,780
Yeah, that's right.
I know that.

109
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,000
I used to have something
to hope for: My freedom.

110
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,700
That was a long time ago.

111
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:17,000
Now the war is over.
Now you've got your freedom.

112
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,000
I found out what it was worth.

113
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,040
That's why I drink.

114
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,400
George, who is Caldwell?

115
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,320
Do you remember that?

116
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,640
Sounds different.

117
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,540
I ain't got but three strings.

118
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,800
I'm waiting for them to bust.

119
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,080
And kneel with them.

120
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,400
You said there was a man,
caused a trouble down the saloon?

121
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,180
That's right, Mr. Caldwell.

122
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,680
Well, tell me
more about it, Slade.

123
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,000
He shot Ben and Charlie,
without even turning around.

124
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
Don't talk balderdash, man. 

125
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,560
There ain't nobody can hit a target
without looking at it.

126
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,200
-Without looking at it?
-You're right!

127
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,920
There are two men who can.

128
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,640
Our Pa is one,
and the other is...

129
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,920
-You have part of my offend, Keoma!
-Yeah we're gonna get you.

130
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,160
Little bastard Indian!

131
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,720
Hey, boys!
Launch is ready.

132
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,920
C'mon in, Keoma!

133
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,320
Aren't you hungry?

134
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,480
Come on in!

135
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,520
Well, you gotta
stand there all the day?

136
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,280
C'mon in!

137
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,480
Welcome home, son!

138
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,940
You've been gone
quite a while this time.

139
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:07,560
Where have you been?

140
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,280
Fighting at war.

141
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,560
You winned it or lose it?

142
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,160
I just happened to be
in the winning side.

143
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,560
-Did you see anybody faster than you?
-Not yet!

144
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,680
Maybe I never will.

145
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,680
C'mon over here,
you over-grown Pappous.

146
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,480
What's with the town?
What's going on there?

147
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:48,920
I say there won't be no town.

148
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,240
They are like guns,
won't defend themselves.

149
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,560
-Won't fight back.
-How about my half-brothers?

150
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,900
The boys chose the side
of the strongest.

151
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:02,000
I can't blame them for that.

152
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,700
And who is the strongest?

153
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,200
Caldwell.

154
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,960
You used to be the strongest.

155
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,360
The fastest.
I used to be the fastest.

156
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,800
That's not the strongest.

157
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,320
This means you'll
live a little longer.

158
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,760
Don't need you ride either.

159
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:23,998
I have lived long enough
to find out how wrong..

160
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:27,960
..I was about...
so many things.

161
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,160
The great Shannon

162
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,080
I saw George.

163
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,520
Hmm..
Did you?

164
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,160
Pa?

165
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,320
-What was it all about?
-What?

166
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,280
The war.
I never could figure it out.

167
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,200
The war.
Not sure I know.

168
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,840
I figured after we got through
slogering all the Indians..

169
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,040
..we thought we gotta
do something.. generous.

170
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Thought we get the freedom
to the black man.

171
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,600
Now we here are good. We're
going back to.. end itch off the Indians.

172
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,560
You've been in love, yet?

173
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,720
Not as much as you.

174
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,200
Well...

175
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,160
Yeah...

176
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,720
She was quite a woman.

177
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,480
You must be very lonely.

178
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,320
You know what it is,
you're searching for?

179
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
Myself, I guess.
I don't know.

180
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,640
I need to find out who I am.

181
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,960
To be the simplest of
my actions or result.

182
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,440
I know my being in this world
has something of significance.

183
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,200
But I'm affraid when I find out
what it is, to be too late.

184
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
In the meantime, I'm a vaguer.

185
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I keep travelling. Even when
the Earth sleeps I keep travelling.

186
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,680
Chasing shadows.

187
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
I think that's the way you have
gone when your mother died.

188
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,880
When you were away.

189
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,680
I'd like to do something, Keoma.

190
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,760
You know, that's funny,
whole my life I've looked to death. 

191
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,760
Looked him straight in the eye.

192
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,020
I was never affraid.

193
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,720
Now I'm old.

194
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,400
Dying slowly.

195
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,120
I wanna live

196
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm affraid.

197
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,400
What should I do?

198
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,000
I can't shoot it
out of my own sons.

199
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,540
<i>Come on, beast. Gather around here!
Get her out of here. Throw her out!</i>

200
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,700
Right out, right out!

201
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,480
Don't let her touch anything.
Keep her off the furniture.

202
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,660
We don't wanna get infected.
You better use your sister's.

203
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,600
-What am I gonna do?
-Don't wanna get infected by you.

204
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,300
I have to burn everything
I have in my room.

205
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:51,000
Get out all of you.

206
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,400
<i>For God's sake throw her out,
</i>

207
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,560
Well, well...
Look who's here!

208
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,800
Get the dean* on lean*,
lady friend.

209
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
Hey, what happened
to your shepheroo?

210
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,120
Don't tell me
the honey moon is over!

211
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,120
Move! Come on!

212
00:29:11,121 --> 00:29:12,920
Whait a minute,
who's gonna pay me back!

213
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,040
Nigger, you shouldn't step
on my path like that.

214
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,520
That was a dumb thing to do.
You're leaving your stinking around.

215
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,240
I've just gotta clean it up.

216
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,400
<i>But I could;
but it was too many of them.</i>

217
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,720
She didn't have a chance
with a called* black as me.

218
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,960
I can hardly defend myself.

219
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,080
They said it was Caldwell.

220
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,800
Caldwell?
Where is she now?

221
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,480
I tried,
God knows I tried.

222
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Where did they take her?

223
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,160
Where did they
take her, "nigger"?

224
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,780
They said something
about the old mine.

225
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,700
Where the sick people are.

226
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,160
George, I didn't mean it!

227
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,920
Slade, Chuck! Find her.

228
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,080
It's no use.
You can't save her.

229
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,200
Hey lady! We wanna
talk to you. Come on out!

230
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,720
You're deaf?

231
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,700
Come on out, if you don't want me
to do something I might regret.

232
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,120
We have found her.

233
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,340
What's the name of the man
who took you too the saloon?

234
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,960
Tell me his name.

235
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,200
You wanna die?

236
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,560
You got pain?
What's his name?

237
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:05,160
I don't know!
He never told me.

238
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,520
This is true, I promise you.

239
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,800
I don't believe you lady.

240
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,460
This is your last chan..

241
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,800
This is my son, George!

242
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,160
My dear brothers.

243
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,720
-Butch.
-Sam,

244
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,640
Lenny.

245
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,280
Three names..

246
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,160
..one brand.

247
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,560
There is no use,
hiding your faces.

248
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,880
It won't change
the way you behave.

249
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,280
It's been a long time.

250
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,600
But you haven't changed a bit.

251
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,080
Why don't you
get out of here?

252
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:01,080
You're will be never
welcomed in our family.

253
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,280
You don't have to rush it.

254
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,600
Our half-brother knows
how to run away..

255
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,920
..when he feels like it.

256
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,240
That's enough with that.

257
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,320
Forget your family's quarrels.

258
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,280
These poor people,
made these an accomodation.

259
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,400
I don't have food to sustain them.

260
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,040
That is up to us.

261
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,000
There are neigbours.
They're saying that they get it.

262
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:39,100
But 'cos the rest of the world is
ignored them with the plague..

263
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:40,840
..raging the murders.

264
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,240
But if we give them
a brotherly hand,

265
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,840
We can overcome this crisis.

266
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,080
Will you join us?
I'll pay you well.

267
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,760
You'll pay, don't worry.

268
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
And my price is high.

269
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,260
We'll see.

270
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,960
Go away, stranger!

271
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,160
Don't try to help us.
We're already dead.

272
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,960
But, you're still affraid?
That hasn't changed that?

273
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,520
It's not for ourselves,
it's for our wives and children,

274
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,600
And the town,
for we'd infect it.

275
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,560
But if we rebel,
or if you're trying to help us,

276
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,160
Caldwell will take it out on them.

277
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,640
It's said,
for coward people like you,

278
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,120
That bastards,
like Caldwell will going on living.

279
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,840
Keoma, I had to warn you.
You can't take her back to town.

280
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,320
The town is surrounded.

281
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,440
-She needs a doctor.
-Can't do it alone.

282
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,840
I have to do it alone.
Because I am alone.

283
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,600
This is my son, George!
This is your new family.

284
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,600
-Why did he come back
-What does he expect to proof?

285
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:18,040
That nothing's changed between us?

286
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:21,040
That he can stand our way like
he's done ever since we were kids?

287
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Well, let me tell ye, Pa!
He won't.

288
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,400
Times are different now.
Times are changed around here.

289
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:28,480
He's been away too long.

290
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,600
And the only thing
that's keeping us..

291
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,560
..from taking* a bullet to his head,
is all respect for you.

292
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,640
You gotta stop
putting into Shannonigans.

293
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,080
Are you deathmatch*
affraid of Keoma?

294
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,970
Or are you affraid of what
Caldwell will gonna think of you?

295
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,720
Hell no, but you never
give us a chance Pa.

296
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,080
You are too busy caring
for that half-breed.

297
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,200
You haven't any time for us.

298
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,460
You've never gave us
the affection you gave to him.

299
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:03,760
For God's sake
we're your real sons.

300
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,960
Real sons?

301
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,920
All of you are my sons.

302
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,720
Since has never been any
difference, you made a difference.

303
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,960
This is it home. You can
come and go as your pleases.

304
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,720
And joking, you!

305
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:26,940
You can come and you
can go to hell as your please.

306
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,240
We'll catch this son-of-a-bitch
sooner or later.

307
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:40,040
Yeah. I hate to be in his boots,
when Caldwell is halving* him.

308
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,200
He don't deserve no better.
He's only a goddamn Indian.

309
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,600
That Caldwell is a mean man.

310
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,000
Hey, nigger! This time's better
off without that gut-puked.

311
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:54,060
I guess he ain't had
enough to drink yet today.

312
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:55,260
Yeah, you're right.

313
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:57,760
When he gets skinful,
he plays really cheerful.

314
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,840
-George?
-Yes, it's me.

315
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
This isn't the time yet.
The few more days.

316
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,200
Otherwise she's in perfect health. 

317
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,240
Nothing's wrong with her.
All she needsd now is rest.

318
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,080
You can take her away.
There's nobody outside.

319
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,160
Good!

320
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,990
-She's staying here.
-She's sta.. oh, no no!

321
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:48,240
That's impossible.

322
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:51,080
She can't stay here.
If they find out,

323
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,080
It will be all over for us.

324
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,120
How much's Caldwell paying you
not to treat the plague victims?

325
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,760
Oh, how dare you to say that?
I do all I can.

326
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,680
It won't be all the matter of medicines
or contact the authorities.

327
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,120
Caldwell is gambling at anyone
at the town, unless they're dead.

328
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,800
How am I going to
fight them? Alone?

329
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,680
And there's my wife.
I have to think of her.

330
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
She's the only thing I got.

331
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,800
No no no, I don't wanna
be mixed up in this.

332
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,400
So you just give up in
by inch by inch.

333
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But if you feel like that
it might as well be that now.

334
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,200
What's happened to you, George?

335
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,480
I used to admire you so much.

336
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,800
I have never forgotten
the lessons you taught me.

337
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,200
You were my idol.

338
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,920
You were the black man
and I, the half-Indian.

339
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,960
I learned from you that the color of
man's skin doesn't make any difference.

340
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,920
And those days you were
never affraid of anything.

341
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,440
From a wild-cat to a grizzly bear.

342
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,480
And you could duel any man in town
with one hand behind your back.

343
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,240
And now, look at you!

344
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,440
Both of you.
Two cowards.

345
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,640
What do we have to do?

346
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,820
Get out of town. Inform the authorities
and bring back medical supplies.

347
00:43:24,821 --> 00:43:26,720
But, how?

348
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,600
You've already said it.

349
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,280
We'll go like the date.

350
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,520
-Alright, George.
-Why are you helping us?

351
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,760
Who are you doing it for?

352
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
For myself maybe.

353
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,240
George!

354
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,520
-Where is he?
-Where's that son-of-a-bitch hiding?

355
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,000
Talk!

356
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,620
Are you looking for me?

357
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,120
We told you to
keep the head out of here.

358
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,800
So how come you're still here?

359
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
Why don't you go hunt buffalo?

360
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,280
Now get going!

361
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,760
You miserable little bastard!

362
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,200
You scum!
You no good half-breed.

363
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,760
Get lost, hey Keoma!

364
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,600
-Half-breed!
-Bastard Indian!

365
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,680
Filthy animal!

366
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,080
What's it gonna be?
Three against one?

367
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,200
-Like the old days?
-I can beat you by myself.

368
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,320
Your gun.
Mine's over there.

369
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,360
Won't you get up?

370
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,400
What's the matter, Indian?
You don't look like you feel so good.

371
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,320
See what heppens when you
go picking up fight?

372
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,920
It ain't healthy.

373
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,400
Hey, hey!

374
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,720
Are you dead?

375
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,120
Haven't you had enough?

376
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,880
You ain't no match for me, Keoma!

377
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,560
But if you want me to hurt you..

378
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,760
Lenny!

379
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,400
-What have you got in there?
-Nothing much.

380
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,240
Just annother victim
of the plague. A nigger.

381
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:19,220
There's only one nigger in the town.
He is with his fiddle.

382
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,520
George, I saw him
a little while ago.

383
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,040
-Check the wagon.
-Go ahead...

384
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,720
Look how stinking* as he's now.

385
00:51:25,721 --> 00:51:28,040
Get it at an empty bottle of Wiskey.

386
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,520
Eww.. he's disgusting.

387
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,220
-I told you
-Get him out of here.

388
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:37,120
Yeah, It'd be my pleasure.

389
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,760
George!
You can come back to life now.

390
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,240
The coast is clear.

391
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,880
Hey doc! We sure fooled them, ha?

392
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:07,080
Not yet. Don't be forgetting.
We got to make it back.

393
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,160
Come on!
Get me those reins.

394
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,040
The three Shannons.

395
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,720
The terrors of the west.

396
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,280
And you think you go inherit
the legend of your father.

397
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,440
Why you three yellow-belly cowards
couldn't even take care of one half-breed?

398
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,360
He wiped the countryside with you.

399
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,760
And you wanted to join up with me,

400
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,440
Be my partners.

401
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,500
Why, I'd rather team up
with a bunch of old women?

402
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:50,600
They're right,
with all I see* in you.

403
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,040
I'll ride into town,
and handle this my way.

404
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,480
Meantime, why don't you
run home to your Pappy,

405
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,340
And let HIM take care of you?

406
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:06,440
Before you really
get into some trouble?

407
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,040
Let's go!

408
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,640
Search every house!
Get everybody out in the street!

409
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,360
 

410
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,360
They're searching for us.

411
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,440
We go, have the back.

412
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,960
Okay, where is he, lady?

413
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:47,399
How dare you breaking in
my house like this?

414
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,400
Who do you think you are?
Get out of here!

415
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,960
-Where do I find your husband?
-How should I know?

416
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,400
If you do find him, you tell him
to bother coming home when all it's over.

417
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,260
<i>Slow down looking at here.</i>

418
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:01,560
<i>I'm going right back
and check out these houses here.</i>

419
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,080
<i>Alright, hurry up!
That was them running here.</i>

420
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,760
<i>-How about the tail*?
-Ok, I'll go back and check it.</i>

421
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,080
<i>Why are you on here?
Go get stable.</i>

422
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,760
<i>-Not even a chase?
-No!</i>

423
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,920
Gotta be here, somewhere.
Go find him!

424
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,560
Halt!

425
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,160
Come on, get the hell outta here.
Gates look and go, over there.

426
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,860
Come on, come on!

427
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,400
Move it!

428
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,480
Hey, what's the matter with Billie?

429
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,080
Tank passed his neck, find him!

430
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,640
Stand up!

431
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,880
Nice and easy now!

432
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,640
Well, well...
Look who I've found.

433
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,680
This way.

434
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,160
She's sleeping.

435
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,760
Take care of her!

436
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,520
Keoma!

437
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,360
Keep yourself look up behind you!

438
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,240
Well look who it is,
it's the undertaker.

439
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,630
I'm just doing my duty
to the town's folks.

440
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:52,030
Taking care of them
from cradle to the grave.

441
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:57,840
It's torture doc! I don't know what'll
those get paintless do without you.

442
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,240
The next thing you don't know,
is how to smuggling medicines.

443
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,400
We made it, George!
We made it. It's easy going from now on.

444
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,560
Hey everybody!

445
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,040
We've got the medicine.
We've got the medicine!

446
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,480
Al, Jake! Go and get your Wives.

447
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,080
We've got the medicine!

448
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,280
We can stop the plague now.

449
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,680
Come on, we finally got
the medicine we need.

450
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,400
-And we got food too.
-Come and get what you need.

451
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:41,280
You're gonna be alright, come!

452
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,000
 

453
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,400
We've got some medicine,
and food!

454
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,200
And the authorities
are gonna send more.

455
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,680
And another thing.
They're sending a federal Marshall.

456
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,100
Oh, thank God!

457
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,100
Can't believe it!

458
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,881
Won't be any good, lady!

459
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,240
Hey, see you finally found the chance
to be here all, ha? Good for you.

460
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,920
Go on unload then, doc!

461
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,400
-But these are only medicines.
-I don't give a damn.

462
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,920
This land belongs to Mr. Caldwell.

463
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,360
Along with everything that's on it.

464
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,320
Now that you had to pay for the water,
and now you gotta pay for medicine.

465
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,060
Hey!

466
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,600
I'll pay this time.

467
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,000
How much you're willing to pay?

468
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,120
Four cents.

469
01:01:56,721 --> 01:01:58,760
Four cents is mighty little.

470
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,640
The price of four bullets.

471
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,480
One,

472
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,240
Two,

473
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,720
Three,

474
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,120
And four.

475
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,400
Take it.

476
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,000
That's your name on it.

477
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,440
Now go tell Caldwell
that I'm waiting here for him.

478
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,240
Waiting for me, ha?

479
01:03:01,932 --> 01:03:05,520
Well, that's the last time
he's gonna have to wait.

480
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,320
Come on out!

481
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,240
I think it's about time
we got rid of Caldwell.

482
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,019
Get rid of him?
That would be a big mistake.

483
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:23,325
Right now he's the one
we need the most.

484
01:03:23,326 --> 01:03:24,990
Come on, Butch,
what are you talking about?

485
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:26,800
What the hell do we need him for?

486
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:30,800
I figured, if Keoma
doesn't get to him first,

487
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,120
Mr. Caldwell's gonna
make us a fine executioner.

488
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,800
Executioner?
Who, Caldwell?

489
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:41,060
Yeah!

490
01:03:41,261 --> 01:03:44,600
We got a chance to kill
two birds with one stone.

491
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,940
We play our cards right.

492
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:49,840
Keoma and Caldwell
will kill each other.

493
01:03:49,841 --> 01:03:53,407
And that's gonna leave the town
temporarily without a leader.

494
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,840
And then?

495
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,740
Well, nothing's gotta stop us.

496
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:02,441
We'll then end taking
tight control of the town.

497
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,960
Running it anywhere
with time we'll want.

498
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,640
Now let's go to see what
that two birds are doing.

499
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,755
Let me through!
My son's ill.

500
01:05:03,955 --> 01:05:06,115
Please, please let me through!

501
01:05:06,275 --> 01:05:09,015
He's quite alright. Take him away.
Nothing's wrong with him.

502
01:05:09,055 --> 01:05:12,195
-Who's next?
-See Mr. Abel*, just this and be good.

503
01:05:12,315 --> 01:05:15,155
Ok, you take two of these,
three times a day. Alright?

504
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,115
Hey, come on, what are you doing?
It's too early for this. It's all scheduled.

505
01:05:18,235 --> 01:05:21,155
Everything's gonna be alright.
You'll see it.

506
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,240
Caldwell's coming. Everybody
go home, and shut the sakes*.

507
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,480
Go on, hurry, hurry!

508
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:43,120
Alright friends, he's right out.
Bring me that goddamn half-breed.

509
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,400
Alright Keoma,
come on out!

510
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,080
You can't hold all
against us alone.

511
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,440
You're wrong, Caldwell.

512
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,880
He's not alone.

513
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,560
Wolf, take your pethude*,
and flesh them out.

514
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,040
Just like old times, Mr. Shannon!

515
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,320
Welcome back, George!

516
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,440
It's good to be back.

517
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,800
What are you waiting for?
Go get him!

518
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,960
That lousy hair flees, making fools
out of your blundering, ain't it?

519
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,280
Hold it!

520
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,840
Sorry, there ain't
no name on this bullet.

521
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:32,200
Half-breed!
Come on down out of there.

522
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,160
Or I'll blow out his head off

523
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,680
No!

524
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,680
No, Keoma!

525
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,660
No!

526
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:47,352
Now you see what happens,
to anyone who gets in my way?

527
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,600
Caldwell!

528
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,080
You shouldn't have
done that, Caldwell.

529
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:09,160
I'm sorry boys.
That was nothing I could do.

530
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,220
You see,

531
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:15,640
He turned against us.
He turned against me,

488
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,200
And against you.

532
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,640
He was helping that Indian.

533
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:26,239
Remember how we've done with
the traitors in the war?

534
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:30,384
We shot 'em like dogs.

535
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,200
Here lies,
William H. Shannon.

536
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,760
The man we all
loved and admired.

537
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,040
A very special sort of man.

538
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,660
There was no person on earth he refused
to help with when they needed it.

539
01:22:57,676 --> 01:23:01,120
Not one person who
would have betrayed him.

540
01:23:01,688 --> 01:23:04,105
Except the one
he gave his love to.

541
01:23:04,185 --> 01:23:06,243
His bastard son.

542
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,935
We learned from father
to respect law and justice.

543
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,600
But you didn't.

544
01:23:13,767 --> 01:23:16,567
Only filled with
sell out his own father.

545
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:21,480
But died alone. It's not
the extent of his guilt.

546
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,020
He betraid us all when he brought back
that plagued woman to infect us.

547
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,455
How far can a man sink?

548
01:23:28,535 --> 01:23:32,120
He betrayed his father.
He betrayed us,

549
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,480
And he betrayed each and
every one of you, my friends.

550
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,120
Keoma is responsible with
the death of your loved ones.

551
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,840
He has brought this
despair to this town.

552
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,080
So now...
what should we do with him?

553
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,360
Take the law on our own hands?

554
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,200
Drag him to the nearest tree and
straight him up like he deserves?

555
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,400
No...

556
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,240
For we're honorable men.

557
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:02,280
And prefer like justice.
Take it to courts.

558
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:08,560
As it should have done with this
son*-of-a-snake, in a court of law.

559
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:14,400
We already called the Marshall.
He'll be here in few hours.

560
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,160
And then Keoma will be...
HIS problem.

561
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,260
And as soon as my brother is here,
and he's more than a sherriff,

562
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,160
All we start rebuilding around here.

563
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,760
Like this kind of place
we can be proud of.

564
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,280
Where it takes, Sam!

565
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,640
Coming to saloon, Lenny?

566
01:24:35,641 --> 01:24:38,840
Why didn't you make yourself
the mayor of the town?

567
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,320
Keoma!
Keoma?

568
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,440
Keoma!

569
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:11,240
Yes sir!
We all turn this hill town,

570
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,360
Into a regular metropolis.

571
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,770
-I think I've created a monster.
-Yeah.

572
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,760
Hey sam! Looks like
I've got my hands fulled.

573
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,920
That woman take out
cuts you to down a size.

574
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,280
Butch, Lenny!

575
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:56,000
Goddamit!
Come on, let's go find him!

576
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,680
I can't Keoma!
He'll die!

577
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,393
He can't die,
and you know why?

578
01:34:37,473 --> 01:34:43,580
Because he's free,
and the man who is free never dies.

579
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:56,000
