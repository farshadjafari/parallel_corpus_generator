1
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,395
In Jailhouse Rock,
he was everything rockabilly is about.

2
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,898
I mean he is rockabilly:

3
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:22,193
Mean, surly, nasty, rude.

4
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:25,822
In that movie, he couldn't give a fuck
about nothin'.

5
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:28,699
Except rocking and rolling,
living fast, dying young...

6
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:31,160
and leaving a good-looking corpse.

7
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:37,959
I watch that hillbilly
and I want to be him so bad.

8
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,462
Elvis looked good.

9
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:46,968
Hey, I'm no fag.
But Elvis was prettier than most women.

10
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:48,719
You know? Most women.

11
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:56,644
You know I always said,
if I had to fuck a guy. I mean had to...

12
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,771
and my life depended on it...

13
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:01,440
I'd fuck Elvis.

14
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:04,318
I'd fuck Elvis.

15
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:07,989
Really?

16
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:10,449
Well, when he was alive, not now.

17
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,244
I don't blame you.

18
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:15,204
So, we'd both fuck Elvis.

19
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,834
It's nice to meet people
with common interests, ain't it?

20
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:25,381
Well, enough about the King.
How about you?

21
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,968
How about me what?

22
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:34,140
How about you go to the movies
with me tonight?

23
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,393
What are we gonna see?

24
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:40,146
A Sonny Chiba triple feature.

25
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,690
The Streetfighter,
Return of the Streetfighter...

26
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,734
and Sister Streetfighter.

27
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,861
Who's Sonny Chiba?

28
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:49,155
"Who's Sonny Chiba?"

29
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:53,743
Well, he is, bar none, the finest actor
working in martial arts movies today.

30
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:57,371
You want to take me to a kung fu movie?

31
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,459
Three kung fu movies.

32
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,049
I don't think so.

33
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,427
Not really my cup of tea.

34
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,930
All right.

35
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:56,699
I had to come all the way
from the highways and byways...

36
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,826
of Tallahassee, Florida...

37
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,662
to Motor City, Detroit
to find my true love.

38
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,458
If you gave me a million years to ponder...

39
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,129
I would never have guessed that true
romance and Detroit would go together.

40
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:15,343
And to this day, the events that followed
all seem like a distant dream.

41
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,970
But the dream was real...

42
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:20,890
and was to change our lives forever.

43
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:27,855
I kept asking Clarence why our world
seemed to be collapsing...

44
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,982
and everything was so shitty.

45
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:31,943
And he'd say:

46
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:35,238
"That's the way it goes. But don't forget...

47
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,782
"...it goes the other way too".

48
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,160
That's the way romance is.

49
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:44,330
Usually that's the way it goes.

50
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:49,085
But every once in a while,
it goes the other way too.

51
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,760
My heart beats and there is time.

52
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,156
Don't move, Tojo.

53
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:21,659
You'll be unconscious soon....

54
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:23,119
It's an ancient technique.

55
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:24,704
Oxygen.

56
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:26,998
Come.

57
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:35,465
Oh, look what happened!
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

58
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:38,509
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

59
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,554
Oh, Jesus, I am the clumsiest person
in the world.

60
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,931
That's all right. Accidents happen.

61
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:47,894
What a wonderful philosophy.
Thanks for being a sweetheart.

62
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,313
Because you could have been a real dick.

63
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,731
Come on! Ready?

64
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,860
Larry, where are we going?

65
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,707
Look, we don't know
what will be coming next.

66
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,877
You mean you're scared?

67
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,879
Hey, laundromat clothes!

68
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,173
You mind if I smoke?

69
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:19,008
No.

70
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:22,678
Listen, do you mind filling me in
on what I missed?

71
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,680
No, no.

72
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:30,937
See this, that guy up there?
It's Sonny Chiba.

73
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:32,730
The Oriental?

74
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,941
Yeah, the one in black.

75
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:37,860
You want a Goober?

76
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:43,574
Yeah. See, in the beginning of the movie
he was hired to get this guy.

77
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:45,868
You have got popcorn all over you.

78
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,703
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

79
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:51,999
Is he supposed to be a good guy?

80
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,878
He ain't so much a good guy
as he's just a bad motherfucker.

81
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:59,298
I mean, he gets paid by people
to fuck guys up. You know.

82
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,098
You came to see three kung fu movies?

83
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,058
Sure, why not?

84
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:13,396
Nothing, nothing. You're a girl
after my own heart. That's all.

85
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,648
Do you know what time it is?

86
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,817
It's about 12:00.

87
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,945
I suppose you've got to get up early, huh?

88
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,698
No, not particularly, how come?

89
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:28,327
It's just, after a movie,
I like to go get some pie...

90
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:29,495
and talk about it.

91
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,289
Sort of a little tradition I have.

92
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:34,917
Do you like to get pie
after you see a good movie?

93
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:38,045
Yeah, I love to get pie after a movie.

94
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:42,300
Would you like to go
get some pie with me?

95
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:44,969
I'd love some pie.

96
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,810
In that movie, he couldn't give a fuck
about nothing.

97
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:55,313
Except rock-and-roll, living fast,
dying young...

98
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,773
and leaving a good-looking corpse.

99
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,277
Enough about the King. How about you?

100
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,196
How about me what?

101
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:05,990
Well, tell me about yourself.

102
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,075
What do you want to know?

103
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:12,914
Well, for starters, what do you do?
Where are you from?

104
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:15,958
What's your favorite color?
Who's your favorite movie star?

105
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,752
What kind of music do you like?

106
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,213
What are your turn-ons, your turnoffs?

107
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:23,591
I guess the big question is,
do you have a fella?

108
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:27,178
Okay, ask me again, one by one.

109
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,263
What do you do?

110
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,431
I don't remember.

111
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:32,141
- Where are you from?
- I don't know.

112
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:35,436
- What's your favorite color?
- I don't know. Black?

113
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:39,398
- Well, who's your favorite movie star?
- Burt Reynolds.

114
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:41,317
Do you want a bite of my pie?

115
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,361
Yes, I would. A little one.

116
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:44,695
All right.

117
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:49,617
You all right? It's good. You like it?

118
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:52,703
What kind of music do you like?

119
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:55,748
Phil Spector. Girl-group stuff like,
He is a Rebel.

120
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,542
What are your turn-ons?

121
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:03,756
Mickey Rourke, a man who can appreciate
the finer things in life, like sugar.

122
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,635
Elvis' voice, kung fu, pie.

123
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:09,178
Turnoffs?

124
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:11,639
Turnoffs.

125
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:14,767
Persians.

126
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:19,397
Do you have a fella?

127
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:23,234
Ask me that one a little bit later.

128
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:28,489
In a theater full of empty seats,
why did you sit by me?

129
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:32,493
Because you looked like a nice guy.

130
00:10:34,454 --> 00:10:36,998
So I had to dump my popcorn all over you.

131
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,087
I'll get the check. Where to next?

132
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:45,339
Can I peek?

133
00:10:45,673 --> 00:10:47,967
Now don't peek. Keep your eyes shut.

134
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:52,472
All right, I am turning the lights on.
Okay, open them.

135
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,765
Oh, wow!

136
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:58,436
Wow, what a swell place to work!

137
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,272
Yeah, it's cool. I got the keys...

138
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:04,484
so I just come in, you know,
read comics, play music.

139
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,444
You worked here a long time?

140
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:07,945
Almost four years.

141
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:10,573
That is a long time.

142
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:12,492
Yeah, but it's not so bad.

143
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:15,036
I'm pretty friendly
with most of the customers.

144
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,872
So I just hang out, bullshit,
read comic books.

145
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:19,415
You get paid a lot?

146
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,377
No, that's where the trouble
comes into paradise.

147
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:25,421
The boss is a pretty nice guy.

148
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:29,008
He lets you borrow money
from time to time, if you need it.

149
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,807
You want to see what
Spiderman No. 1 looks like?

150
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,891
You bet.

151
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:41,687
Just great stories, great characters,
beautiful artwork.

152
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:44,607
See, in this one, Nick,
he's gotten this ring here...

153
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,402
for his sweetheart and he wears it
around his neck on a chain.

154
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:52,615
And later on in the story,
he gets in this fight with this Nazi bastard.

155
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:54,700
And the Kraut grabs hold of the chain.

156
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:56,786
Well, the ring goes overboard.

157
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,333
Nick, he dives into the ocean to get it.

158
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,253
Isn't that cool?

159
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:52,109
What is it? You're crying?
What did I do? Did I do something?

160
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:53,778
You didn't do nothing.

161
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,071
What is it?

162
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:59,367
I have something I got to tell you.

163
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:06,165
I didn't just happen to be at that theater.
I was paid to be there.

164
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,212
If you were paid to be there, what are you?
A theater-checker?

165
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:14,841
You get paid to check the box-office girls
aren't ripping the place off?

166
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,385
I'm no theater-checker. I'm a call girl.

167
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,097
You're a whore?

168
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,809
No! I'm a call girl,
and there is a difference, you know!

169
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:30,398
Okay, here it goes. You know the place
you took me to last night?

170
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,275
The place you work.

171
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,776
Heroes for Sale?

172
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,444
You got a boss, right?

173
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,571
Yeah.

174
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,197
Okay, what's his name?

175
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,323
Lance.

176
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:42,160
That's him.
He called the place where I work.

177
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,704
He ordered a girl.
He wanted you to get laid.

178
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:48,374
Said you didn't get out much,
and it was your birthday and all.

179
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,336
He wanted me to act like I just showed up.

180
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,214
How did he know you were going to be
at that theater?

181
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:57,967
I go to the movies every year
on my birthday.

182
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:01,804
He called me this week to find out
what my birthday movie was going to be.

183
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:03,139
You're not mad?

184
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,184
No, man. I can't tell you....

185
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,769
That was one of the best times I ever had.

186
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:12,106
It was. You know, I knew something
must be rotten in Denmark.

187
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,525
There's no way you could like me
that much.

188
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,778
I was so relieved
when you took off your dress...

189
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,113
and didn't have a dick.

190
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:21,532
Stop being so fucking calm about all this!

191
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,743
Look in your house.
There's a note on your TV.

192
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,913
It only says "Dear Clarence,"
because I couldn't write anymore.

193
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,332
So I just said, "Alabama, come clean.

194
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:31,584
"Just tell him what's what.
If he tells you...

195
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,920
"...to go back to Drexl and fuck yourself...

196
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,380
"...then go back to Drexl
and fuck yourself".

197
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,132
Drexl? What's a Drexl?

198
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:40,343
Please shut up! I'm trying to come clean.

199
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:44,263
I've been a call girl for exactly four days
and you are my third customer.

200
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,225
I want you to know,
that I am not damaged goods.

201
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:50,144
I'm not what they call in Florida,
white trash!

202
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:51,938
I'm a really good person.

203
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:54,732
And when it comes to relationships...

204
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,360
I am one hundred percent.

205
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:02,156
I am one hundred percent monogamous.

206
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,743
You stay with one guy?

207
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,539
Exactly. If I'm with you, then I'm with you.

208
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,041
And I don't want anybody else.

209
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:16,963
Now, I got to tell you something else.

210
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:20,550
When you said last night was one
of the best times you've had...

211
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,468
did you mean physically?

212
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,888
Yeah, yeah. But I'm talking about
the whole night.

213
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:30,143
I never had as much fun with a girl,
as I had with you, my whole life.

214
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:33,688
It's true. You like Elvis. You like Janis...

215
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:37,441
you like kung fu movies.
You like The Partridge Family....

216
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:41,279
Actually, I don't like The Partridge family.

217
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,698
That was part of the act.

218
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,581
And I feel really goofy saying this...

219
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:56,627
after only knowing you one night,
and me being a call girl and all....

220
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,465
But, I think I love you.

221
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,223
Wait a second.

222
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,730
Look, I've been trying to keep
this whole thing in perspective.

223
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,901
You just said you loved me. If I say
I love you, throw caution to the wind...

224
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:23,529
let the chips fall as they may,
and you're lying, I'll fucking die.

225
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:27,366
I'm not lying to you.
And I swear from this moment forth...

226
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:30,495
I will never lie to you again.

227
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:45,551
Well, hello, Mrs. Worley.

228
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:47,053
How do you do, Mr. Worley.

229
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,096
Top of the morning to you, Mrs. Worley.

230
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,973
Bottom of the ninth, Mr. Worley.

231
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:53,434
By the way, have you seen
your lovely wife today?

232
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,603
My beautiful, charming, sexy wife...

233
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:56,938
Mrs. Alabama Worley?

234
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,815
Are there any others, Mr. Worley?

235
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:00,066
No, not for me, no.

236
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:02,151
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

237
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:14,789
Excuse me. Do you think you could
turn down the heat just a teeny bit?

238
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,211
I must ask you a question.

239
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:21,838
Who and what is a Drexl?

240
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:24,090
- Quiet.
- Huh?

241
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:25,925
He was my pimp.

242
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,802
You had a pimp?

243
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:31,597
I was a call girl.

244
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,432
Call girls have pimps.

245
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,184
Was he black?

246
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:39,397
He thinks he is. He said his mama was
an Apache but I suspect he's lying.

247
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,565
Is he nice?

248
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:45,945
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He treated me pretty decent.

249
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:50,116
I was only there for four days.
He got a little bit rough the other day.

250
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:53,453
- What do you mean? With you?
- No, with my friend Ilene.

251
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,496
What did he do to Ilene?

252
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,790
Slapped her around.
Kicked her in the stomach.

253
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:59,125
It was scary.

254
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,794
This motherfucker sounds beautiful.

255
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:06,632
What did you do to end up
with a son of a bitch like that?

256
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,013
What are you talking about?

257
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:14,265
Floyd say he don't be eating pussy.

258
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:18,895
Drexl, any nigger says he don't eat pussy's
lying his ass off.

259
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:20,313
I heard that.

260
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:23,274
Hold on a second.
Big D., you saying you eat pussy?

261
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:26,444
Yeah, motherfucker, I eat the pussy,
I eat the bud.

262
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,112
I eat every fucking thing.

263
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:31,741
If I ever did eat any pussy,
I would never eat any pussy, right?

264
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:34,160
But if I did eat some pussy...

265
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,621
I sure as hell wouldn't tell
no goddamn body.

266
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:40,541
- I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
- Shit, nigger, you smoke enough Sherm...

267
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,336
your dumb ass would do
a lot of motherfucking things.

268
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:46,088
You'd be up in there suckin' niggers' dicks!

269
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:52,261
Fuck you guys, man.
You guys are fucked up, all right?

270
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:55,181
Hey. Wait a second.
We's just fucking with you.

271
00:19:56,182 --> 00:20:00,186
In fact, I'm going to show you what
I mean with a little demonstration.

272
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:01,854
Toss me the burner.

273
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:06,484
All right, dig this.

274
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:11,239
Pretend it's that fine centerfold bitch.

275
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:14,617
You know what I'm saying?
And you are you.

276
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:02,999
- Honey, where you going?
- Bathroom.

277
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:31,777
- Well, can you live with it?
- What?

278
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,988
I said can you live with it?

279
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:34,906
Live with what?

280
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,451
That son of a bitch walking around
breathing the same air as you.

281
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:40,536
Getting away with it every day.

282
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,164
Are you haunted?

283
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,332
Yeah.

284
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,834
You want to get un-haunted?

285
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:48,753
Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:50,505
Well, I'd kill him.

287
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,716
Shoot him in the face.
Put him down like a dog.

288
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:56,594
I can't believe what you're saying.

289
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:59,514
I'm not saying nothing.
I's just saying what I'd do.

290
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:00,681
You'd do that?

291
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:02,767
The fuck don't deserve to live.

292
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,479
Look, he's haunting me, you know.

293
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:11,067
I want to kill him, but I don't want
to spend the rest of my life in jail.

294
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,610
Hey man, I don't blame you.

295
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:15,655
- If I thought I'd get away with it....
- Get away with it?

296
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:19,200
Killing is the hard part.
Getting away with it, that's easy.

297
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:22,120
You think a cop gives a fuck about a pimp?

298
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:26,207
Listen.
Every pimp in the world could get shot.

299
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:30,211
Two in the back of the fucking head.
Cops would throw a party, man.

300
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,967
As long as you're not at the scene
of the crime...

301
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,720
with a smoking gun in your hand,
you'll get away with it.

302
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:41,889
Clarence, I like you.

303
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:45,351
Always have, always will.

304
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,002
'Bama.

305
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:13,379
Where you going?

306
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,384
I need you to write down
your former address.

307
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:19,802
Why?

308
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:22,889
So I can go over there and
pick up your stuff, that's why.

309
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:26,726
Oh, baby, come on, Clarence.
I just want to disappear from there.

310
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:31,147
I know this scares the shit out of you,
but I'm not scared of that motherfucker.

311
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,984
You are completely out of his reach.
He poses absolutely no threat to you.

312
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,028
If he doesn't matter, and he doesn't...

313
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:40,156
then it seems silly you lose
all your things now.

314
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,324
Listen.

315
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:43,951
You don't know him.

316
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:47,413
No, you don't know me.
Not when it comes to shit like this.

317
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,082
I need to do this.

318
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,961
I want you to know that you can count
on me to protect you.

319
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,509
Come on, please just write it down.

320
00:24:08,184 --> 00:24:09,852
This isn't a good idea.

321
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,522
I'm telling you, it'll be fine.

322
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:14,524
I'll be in and out of there.

323
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:18,903
- Be careful.
- I will.

324
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:25,034
I love you.

325
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:26,619
I love you, too.

326
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,684
You want something?

327
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:33,394
Yeah, you Drexl?

328
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:34,896
No man, I'm Marty.

329
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:37,356
Well, I want to talk to Drexl.

330
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,359
Well, what the fuck you want
to talk to him about?

331
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:42,153
It's about Alabama.

332
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:59,253
He was asking about Alabama.

333
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:03,466
Where the fuck is that bitch?

334
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:04,801
She's with me.

335
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:07,345
Who the fuck are you?

336
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:09,138
I'm her husband.

337
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:15,812
Well, that makes us practically related.

338
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:19,398
Have a seat, boy.

339
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,901
Have an egg roll. We got everything here...

340
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:24,821
from "Little-Eye Joel"
to "Damned if I know".

341
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,405
No, thanks.

342
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:33,037
No, thanks? What that mean?

343
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:37,583
I think you're too scared to be eating.

344
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:45,550
Now, see....

345
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:48,845
We're sitting down here,
ready to negotiate.

346
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,473
And you've already given up your shit.

347
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:54,809
I'm still a mystery to you.

348
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:58,062
But I know exactly where
your white ass is coming from.

349
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:01,983
If I ask you if you want some dinner
and you grab an egg roll...

350
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:05,236
I say, he's acting like he ain't got
a care in the world.

351
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,989
And who knows? Maybe he don't.

352
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:12,285
Maybe this fool is such
a bad motherfucker...

353
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:15,788
he don't have to worry about nothing.
He just sits down...

354
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,040
and watches my motherfucking TV.

355
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:19,333
See?

356
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:24,213
You haven't even sat down yet.

357
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,425
That TV over there,
since you've been here...

358
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:30,344
has a woman with her breast
just hanging out.

359
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:33,055
Well, you haven't even bothered to look.

360
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:35,266
You just been clocking me.

361
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:44,275
Now, I know I'm pretty.
But I'm not as pretty as a couple of titties.

362
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:50,114
This child be fierce.

363
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,669
I'm not eating because I'm not hungry.

364
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,797
I'm not sitting because I'm not staying.

365
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,717
I'm not looking at the movie because
I've already seen it seven years ago.

366
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:10,885
It is The Mack.

367
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,513
Max Julian, Carol Speed and Richard Pryor.

368
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you.

369
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:21,270
That's payoff money.
Alabama is moving on to greener pastures.

370
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:23,481
We're not negotiating, I don't like to barter.

371
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,775
What's in there is for my peace of mind.

372
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:29,362
My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more.

373
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,498
It's empty.

374
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:54,720
Marty, you know what we got here?
A motherfucking Charlie Bronson.

375
00:28:57,223 --> 00:28:58,474
"Mr. Majestyk?"

376
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:01,769
Look here, Charlie.

377
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:04,981
None of this bullshit is necessary.

378
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:07,191
I don't got no hold over Alabama.

379
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,237
I was just trying to lend a girl
a helping hand.

380
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:11,506
That's what you get.

381
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,592
You fuck with me, white-boy!

382
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:18,179
Look at this!
You fond of my motherfucking freaks?

383
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:20,097
Shit! You motherfucker!

384
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:21,974
Your ass got to be crazy!

385
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,611
You must have thought
it was white-boy day.

386
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,198
It ain't white-boy day, is it?

387
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:39,283
No man, it ain't white-boy day.

388
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:42,161
Shit man, you done fucked up again.

389
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,264
Well, well, well.

390
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:03,683
Look what we got here.

391
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:06,727
Clarence Worley?

392
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:11,399
It sounds almost like a nigger name.

393
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:14,443
And I know where you live.

394
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:18,447
4900, 160th Street...

395
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:20,032
Apartment 48.

396
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:25,455
And I would make a million-dollar bet,
that Alabama is at the same address.

397
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:29,083
Marty, take the car, go get her.
Bring her dumb ass back here.

398
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:33,254
I think I'll keep lover boy here entertained.

399
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:38,843
Hey, Marty!

400
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,428
What the fuck are you doing?

401
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,723
- I can't find my jacket!
- Go look in the fucking hamper.

402
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:54,025
You!

403
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,612
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it.
You want to get fucking shot?

404
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,239
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it!

405
00:32:00,364 --> 00:32:03,493
I just did you the biggest fucking favor
of your life!

406
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,287
Open your eyes.

407
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,290
I said open your fucking eyes!

408
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,002
You thought it was pretty fucking funny.
Didn't you?

409
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:15,963
Fuck you! You piece of shit!

410
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:22,094
Don't fucking move!

411
00:32:22,553 --> 00:32:25,681
I was selfish. I know I was selfish.
l was, but...

412
00:32:28,184 --> 00:32:30,353
I was carrying your child, babe.

413
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:43,282
I killed him.

414
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,494
Want a hamburger or something?
I'm starving to death.

415
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:47,870
Is this a joke?

416
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:49,664
No joke.

417
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,253
That was the best fucking hamburger
I ever had in my life.

418
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:57,964
I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

419
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:01,217
Come on, eat something, you'll feel better.

420
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:09,475
What the fuck you crying for?

421
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:14,021
He's not worth one of your tears.
Would you rather it have been me?

422
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:17,567
Is that it? Is that what you want?
I mean, do you love him?

423
00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:19,485
Do you love him?

424
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:22,071
I said, do you fucking love him?

425
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:25,074
- I think what you did was...
- What?

426
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,326
- I think what you did...
- What?

427
00:33:27,785 --> 00:33:30,496
was so romantic.

428
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:39,046
Oh, baby, you're bleeding.

429
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,969
I got your things right here.

430
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:50,475
Clean clothes.

431
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:52,643
I love you.

432
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,729
I love you. There is a God.

433
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:22,381
These aren't my clothes.

434
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:47,698
Rommel, where are you?
Come on get in here. Get in here now.

435
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,731
Good morning, Daddy.

436
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:22,692
Hey, Rommel.

437
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:24,527
Long time no see, huh?

438
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,328
Now you're going to have
to excuse the place.

439
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:38,291
I haven't exactly been doing
a lot of entertaining...

440
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,543
of company as of late.

441
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:44,297
I'm sorry if I seem a little tense.

442
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:49,343
But you're the last person in the world,
that I expected to see this morning.

443
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:53,014
Well, that's okay, Daddy,
I tend to have that effect on people.

444
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:56,309
You got anything to drink around here?
I'm dying of thirst.

445
00:35:56,392 --> 00:36:00,605
Now there should be,
there should be a Seven-Up in there.

446
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:02,231
Anything stronger?

447
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,110
Probably not. Beer.
You can drink beer, can't you?

448
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,614
I can, but I don't.

449
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:13,868
That's about all I ever eat.

450
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:17,121
Excuse me.

451
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:19,791
Hello, hello, hello.

452
00:36:20,374 --> 00:36:21,626
I'm his father.

453
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:27,381
Well that's all right. I'm his wife,
Alabama Worley. Pleased to meet you.

454
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,384
We got married.

455
00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:50,655
Lover, why don't you be a sport
and go get us some beer?

456
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,240
You want some beer?

457
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,742
If you want some, it'll be here. Okay?

458
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:56,536
Where is a liquor store around here?

459
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:59,080
There is a party store down 54th Street.

460
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:03,709
Get a six-pack of something imported.

461
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:07,171
Hard to tell you what to get.
Different places have different things.

462
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:09,549
Here, that should cover it, okee-dokee?

463
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:11,300
Okee-dokee, Doggy Daddy.

464
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:26,357
Ain't she the sweetest goddamn thing
you ever saw in your whole life?

465
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,485
I mean, is she a four-alarm fire, or what?

466
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,780
She seems very nice.

467
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:34,866
Nice?

468
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:38,911
Daddy, "nice" is not the word.
I mean this girl, she's a peach.

469
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,539
You know, she even tastes like a peach.

470
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,917
You can tell I'm in love with her, can't you?

471
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:48,212
No, wait. I gotta talk.

472
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:52,592
Sit down! Shut up!

473
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:55,887
You give me a fucking headache.

474
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,724
You are so much like your mother,
I can't believe it.

475
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,268
You are your fucking mother,
through and through.

476
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:05,104
I haven't heard from you in three years.

477
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:09,400
You show up all of a sudden,
at 8:00 in the morning...

478
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:12,236
you walk in here
like a goddamned bulldozer.

479
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:16,365
Now don't get me wrong.
I love you, I'm glad to see you.

480
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:20,620
But slow it down, man.

481
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:23,331
All right?

482
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,042
Now.

483
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,255
When did you get married?

484
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:35,927
Well, Daddy....

485
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,890
I'm in big fucking trouble.

486
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:43,726
I really need your help.

487
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,853
No, no, stop talking.

488
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,484
- What do you want from me?
- What?

489
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:54,821
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant!

490
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,532
You're here because you want me
to help you.

491
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:00,076
What do you need from me?
You need money?

492
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,995
No. You still have friends on the force?

493
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,164
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

494
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:07,291
Could you find out if they know about us?

495
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,378
I don't think they know shit.
But I want to know for sure.

496
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:12,130
You can do that. Right?

497
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:14,298
What makes you think I could do that?

498
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:15,716
Because you were a cop.

499
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,553
But what makes you think
that I would do that?

500
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:21,222
Because I'm your son.

501
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,808
Oh, you're my son.

502
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:27,311
Oh, you got it all worked out, don't you?

503
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:32,358
Look. I mean, goddamn,
I've never asked you for a goddamn thing.

504
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,735
Jesus fucking Christ!
After Mom divorced you...

505
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:37,697
did I ever ask you for anything?
No. I didn't.

506
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,324
When I wouldn't see you
for one or two years...

507
00:39:40,408 --> 00:39:41,909
did I ever get into your shit?

508
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,370
The whole time you were drunk,
did I get mad...

509
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:45,580
point my finger?

510
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:48,666
No! I never did.
Everybody else did, but I didn't!

511
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:52,670
Now look, I just need help,
and you can fucking help me. All right?

512
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:58,176
Now, I'm basically a resourceful guy.
If I didn't really need it, I wouldn't ask.

513
00:39:58,468 --> 00:40:01,596
I mean, if you want to say no, then fine.

514
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:05,725
Forget it, don't worry about it.
No problem, I'm gone, all right?

515
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:12,899
The Virgin is back!

516
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:17,278
Thank God. I could eat a horse.

517
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,113
I didn't get you any chicken.

518
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,448
Well, how come?

519
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:24,076
Honey, it's too early in the morning.
It's only 9:00.

520
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,411
Son of a bitch!

521
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:34,545
Dick Richie! Dick Richie!

522
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:36,714
That's me, I'm me.

523
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,841
Come inside.

524
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:39,926
Okay.

525
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:47,975
Sit. Sit, sit.

526
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:49,560
Now.

527
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:52,355
The part you'll be reading
is one of the bad guys.

528
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:53,898
There's Brian and Marty.

529
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:54,816
Who?

530
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:56,943
Is there a problem?

531
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:58,152
No.

532
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:00,613
Peter Breck has been cast
in the part of Brian.

533
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:03,157
So, you'll be reading for the role of Marty.

534
00:41:03,282 --> 00:41:07,537
In this scene, you're both in a car,
and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.

535
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:09,997
What you want to do is get him off.

536
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:12,667
All right, I'm Marty.

537
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:15,128
Ready?

538
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:19,507
I'm driving.

539
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:21,259
Okay.

540
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:23,928
"Where the fuck did he come from?"

541
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:26,347
"I don't know,
he just appeared like magic".

542
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,350
"Well, don't just sit there, shoot him!"

543
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:31,310
"Get him!"

544
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:32,979
Thank you, Mr. Richie.

545
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,982
I'm very impressed.
You're a very fine actor.

546
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:38,568
Thank you.

547
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:40,403
Thank you.

548
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:42,321
We'll let you know.

549
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,948
Okay.

550
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,534
- Okay, one-handed.
- One hand.

551
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:49,287
Good, try on the other one there.

552
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,913
Here comes the train.

553
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:05,970
Well, they found nothing.
In fact, they think it's drug related.

554
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:08,973
Drug related? Why drug related?

555
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:12,268
Well, apparently Drexl had his
big toe stuck in that shit.

556
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,352
Really?

557
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:17,023
Drexl had an association
with a fellow named Blue Lou Boyle.

558
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:20,026
- Name mean anything to you?
- No.

559
00:42:20,234 --> 00:42:22,904
If you don't hang around his circle,
it shouldn't.

560
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:23,821
Who is he?

561
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:26,574
Gangster, drug dealer.
You don't want him on your ass.

562
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:30,912
Now look, Clarence, the more I hear
about this Drexl fucker...

563
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:35,750
the more I think you did the right thing.
This guy was not just some wild flake.

564
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:39,879
That's what I was trying to tell you before.
The guy was like a mad dog.

565
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:44,383
So, the cops, they don't think....
They're not after us?

566
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:46,761
No. Until they hear something better.

567
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:50,306
They will just assume Drexl
had a falling out with Blue Lou.

568
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:54,560
And once you leave town,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

569
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:59,190
Thanks, thanks a lot, Daddy.
You really came through for me.

570
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,361
I got some money I could give you.

571
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,071
No, keep it. Keep it.

572
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,615
Well now, son.

573
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:10,868
I want you to know that...

574
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:14,872
I hope everything works out
with you and Alabama.

575
00:43:15,915 --> 00:43:16,999
I like her.

576
00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:22,004
And I think you make a real cute couple.

577
00:43:24,924 --> 00:43:27,176
Yeah, well, you stay out of trouble.

578
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:33,182
You got a wife to think about now.

579
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:36,435
Quit fucking around.

580
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:40,439
Son...

581
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:44,569
I love you.

582
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:54,912
All right.

583
00:43:56,622 --> 00:44:00,835
This is my friend Dick Richie's
number and address in Hollywood.

584
00:44:01,335 --> 00:44:03,713
That's where we'll be.

585
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:04,881
All right.

586
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:08,342
Come on, Alabama. We're taking off.
Kiss Pops goodbye.

587
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:14,432
'Bye, Daddy. Hope to see you again soon.

588
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,895
Hey, hey!

589
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:21,105
What kind of smackaroo is that?

590
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,069
I'll send you a postcard from Hollywood.

591
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:28,529
Alabama.

592
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:29,864
Yes, sir?

593
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:31,407
Take care of him for me.

594
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:34,035
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll keep him on a short leash.

595
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:38,206
As the sun sets slowly in the west.
We bid you a fine farewell.

596
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:49,383
Son of a bitch was right.
She tastes like a peach.

597
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:51,344
Come on, Rommel.

598
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,387
Come on boy.

599
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:10,321
Hello.

600
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:12,114
Hello, baby!

601
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:13,533
Clarence?

602
00:45:13,616 --> 00:45:14,700
You got it!

603
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:17,120
It's great to hear from you,
what's going on?

604
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:19,330
Well, you're going to be seeing me shortly.

605
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:21,332
You're coming to LA! When?

606
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,209
Tomorrow.

607
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:26,546
There's a story behind the letter.

608
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:29,632
By the way, I won't be alone.
I'm bringing my lovely wife.

609
00:45:29,715 --> 00:45:32,343
Get the fuck out of here.
Clarence, you got married?

610
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:34,178
I'm a married man, buddy.

611
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:37,640
You want to say hello to my better half?
Come here.

612
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:39,392
Hi, Dick. This is Alabama Worley.

613
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:41,602
How you doing, Alabama Worley?

614
00:45:42,812 --> 00:45:45,857
Clarence told me about you.
He said you're his best friend.

615
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,277
- So, that makes you my best friend too.
- Tell him we got to go.

616
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,195
Clarence says we got to go.

617
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,322
Wait, can I speak to Clarence?

618
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:55,783
- Ask him if he got it.
- Did you get the letter?

619
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:56,784
What letter?

620
00:45:56,868 --> 00:45:59,078
- What letter?
- Letters.

621
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:00,955
I didn't get any letter.

622
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,874
Has he gotten his mail yet?

623
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:05,793
- Have you gotten your mail?
- No, my roommate, Floyd....

624
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:09,172
- Has he looked through it?
- Have you looked through it?

625
00:46:11,674 --> 00:46:13,509
Tell him to go look through it.

626
00:46:13,593 --> 00:46:15,344
Go and look through it.

627
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:19,182
Wait, wait, wait.
Can I speak to Clarence, please?

628
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,767
He wants to talk to you.

629
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:24,854
Tell him we got to go.
Tell him, "Read the letter".

630
00:46:25,104 --> 00:46:25,980
Read the letter.

631
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:28,941
Tell him I love him
and that as of tomorrow.

632
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:30,401
Honey, hold this.

633
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:32,528
As of tomorrow...

634
00:46:32,612 --> 00:46:35,531
all your money problems gonna be over.

635
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:39,243
Hello? What money problems?

636
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:42,538
Bye-bye.

637
00:46:44,707 --> 00:46:46,751
Hello?

638
00:47:00,306 --> 00:47:01,307
Floyd!

639
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:04,477
Floyd, you used up the last piece
of toilet paper.

640
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:26,666
Hey! Rommel!

641
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,669
Hey, come here! Rommel!

642
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,941
Frankie.

643
00:47:52,108 --> 00:47:54,735
Tell Luca to go outside
and do you know what.

644
00:48:03,828 --> 00:48:05,955
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

645
00:48:07,665 --> 00:48:09,542
I give up. Who are you?

646
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:14,464
The anti-Christ.
You got me in a vendetta kind of mood.

647
00:48:15,381 --> 00:48:16,841
You can tell the angels...

648
00:48:16,924 --> 00:48:19,260
you never saw evil
so singularly personified...

649
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,888
as in the face of the man who killed you.

650
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:25,892
My name is Vincent Coccotti.
I work as counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle.

651
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:27,894
The man your son stole from.

652
00:48:29,145 --> 00:48:32,899
I hear you were once a cop, so I can
assume you have heard of us before.

653
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:34,150
Am I correct?

654
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,819
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

655
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:41,782
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up
the how-full-of-shit-am-I question...

656
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:44,118
you been asking yourself.

657
00:48:46,037 --> 00:48:47,789
We're going to have a little Q and A.

658
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:50,708
And at the risk of sounding redundant,
please...

659
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,794
make your answers genuine.

660
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:55,463
Want a Chesterfield?

661
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:57,006
No.

662
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:01,010
I have a son of my own,
about your boy's age.

663
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:05,431
I can imagine how painful
this must be for you.

664
00:49:05,515 --> 00:49:06,766
But Clarence...

665
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:10,603
and his bitch of a girlfriend,
brought this on themselves.

666
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:13,564
I implore you not to go down that road
with them.

667
00:49:14,357 --> 00:49:18,027
You could always take comfort
in the fact you never had a choice.

668
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:21,239
I'd like to help you if I could...

669
00:49:21,322 --> 00:49:23,407
but I haven't seen Clarence.

670
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:29,372
You see that?

671
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:35,211
That smarts doesn't it?
To get slammed in the nose.

672
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:39,841
Fucks you up. You get the pain
shooting through your brain...

673
00:49:39,924 --> 00:49:41,968
your eyes fill up with water.

674
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:44,178
It's not any kind of fun.

675
00:49:44,554 --> 00:49:48,307
But, what I have to offer you,
that's as good as it's going to get.

676
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:51,769
And it won't ever get that good again.

677
00:49:52,478 --> 00:49:55,314
We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Cadillac.

678
00:49:57,441 --> 00:49:58,818
Purple Cadillac.

679
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:03,322
Clarence's purple Cadillac,
parked in front of your trailer yesterday.

680
00:50:04,365 --> 00:50:05,449
Mr. Worley.

681
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:07,952
Have you seen your son?

682
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:09,829
I've seen him.

683
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:12,915
I can't be sure of how much he told you.

684
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,751
In the chance you're in the dark
about some of this...

685
00:50:15,835 --> 00:50:19,672
let me shed some light.
That whore your boy hangs around with....

686
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,300
Her pimp is an associate of mine.

687
00:50:23,092 --> 00:50:26,554
Along with other affairs
he works for me in a courier capacity.

688
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:28,389
Well, apparently...

689
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:32,602
that dirty whore found out
we were going to do some business...

690
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:36,939
because your son, the cowboy and
his flame, came into the room blazing...

691
00:50:37,023 --> 00:50:40,776
and didn't stop, until they were
pretty sure everybody was dead.

692
00:50:42,445 --> 00:50:44,238
What are you talking about?

693
00:50:44,697 --> 00:50:47,992
I'm talking about a massacre.
They snatched my narcotics.

694
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:51,954
Hightailed it out of there.
Would have got away with it.

695
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:54,791
But your son, fuckhead that he is...

696
00:50:55,374 --> 00:50:58,544
left his driver's license
in the dead guy's hand.

697
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:03,049
You know.

698
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:04,634
I don't believe you.

699
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,677
That's of minor importance.

700
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:10,014
What's of major fucking importance
is that I believe you.

701
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:13,184
Where did they go?

702
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,353
On their honeymoon.

703
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:24,779
I'm getting angry asking the same question
a second time.

704
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:25,738
Where did they go?

705
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:29,325
They didn't tell me.
Now wait a minute and listen to me.

706
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:31,786
I haven't seen Clarence in three years.

707
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:34,580
He shows up yesterday...

708
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:37,583
with a young girl,
saying that he got married.

709
00:51:39,585 --> 00:51:42,713
He asked for some quick cash...

710
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:48,594
to go on a honeymoon.
He asked me if he could borrow $500.

711
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:52,098
I felt like helping him.

712
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:55,935
So, I wrote him out a check.
We went to breakfast in the morning.

713
00:51:57,895 --> 00:52:00,231
And that's the last I saw of him...

714
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:02,692
so help me God.

715
00:52:04,193 --> 00:52:07,238
They never thought to tell me
where they were going.

716
00:52:08,531 --> 00:52:10,324
And I never thought to ask.

717
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,016
Vincenzo, sir.

718
00:52:35,808 --> 00:52:37,393
There's nothing there.

719
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:40,938
That's not good.

720
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,774
You know.

721
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:47,987
Sicilians are great liars.

722
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:51,157
The best in the world.

723
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:54,827
I'm Sicilian...

724
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:58,748
my father was the world heavyweight
champion of Sicilian liars.

725
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:03,252
From growing up with him,
I learned the pantomime.

726
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:06,923
There are 17 different things
a guy can do when he lies...

727
00:53:07,006 --> 00:53:10,092
to give himself away.
A guy has got 17 pantomimes.

728
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,054
Woman has got 20. Guy has got 17. But...

729
00:53:13,346 --> 00:53:16,265
if you know them,
like you know your own face...

730
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,185
they would beat lie detectors all to hell.

731
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:22,188
Now what we got here
is a game of "Show and Tell".

732
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:26,192
You don't want to show me nothing.
But you're telling me everything.

733
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:29,946
I know you know where they are.
So, tell me...

734
00:53:30,822 --> 00:53:33,866
before I do some damage
you won't walk away from.

735
00:53:37,036 --> 00:53:39,789
Could I have one
of those Chesterfields now?

736
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,334
Sure.

737
00:53:49,215 --> 00:53:50,716
You got a...

738
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:54,595
match? No wait. Don't bother, I got one.

739
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:06,858
You're Sicilian, huh?

740
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:09,443
Yeah, Sicilian.

741
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:14,615
You know....

742
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:17,910
I read a lot.

743
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:20,872
Especially things about history.

744
00:54:23,082 --> 00:54:25,042
I find that shit fascinating.

745
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,714
Here's a fact, whether you know it or not.

746
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:37,305
Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

747
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:46,481
Come again?

748
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:51,402
It's a fact. Yeah. You see...

749
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:56,073
Sicilians have black blood
pumping through their hearts.

750
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:01,204
And if you don't believe me,
you can look it up.

751
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:04,415
Hundreds and hundreds of years ago,
you see...

752
00:55:04,957 --> 00:55:08,795
the Moors conquered Sicily.
And the Moors are niggers.

753
00:55:10,922 --> 00:55:12,673
You see, way back then...

754
00:55:13,466 --> 00:55:16,302
Sicilians were like wops
from northern Italy.

755
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:19,680
They all had blond hair and blue eyes.

756
00:55:19,764 --> 00:55:20,932
But, well....

757
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:25,061
Then the Moors moved in there...

758
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:29,148
they changed the whole country.

759
00:55:29,398 --> 00:55:33,486
They did so much fucking
with Sicilian women.

760
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:37,198
That they changed
the whole bloodline forever.

761
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:40,827
That is why blond hair, blue eyes...

762
00:55:41,077 --> 00:55:44,247
became black hair and dark skin.

763
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,543
You know it's absolutely amazing to me...

764
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:52,505
to think to this day...

765
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:54,590
hundreds of years later...

766
00:55:56,592 --> 00:55:58,261
that Sicilians...

767
00:55:59,345 --> 00:56:01,389
still carry that nigger gene.

768
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:04,892
Now this....

769
00:56:04,976 --> 00:56:07,186
No, I am quoting history.

770
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,941
It's written, it's a fact. It's written.

771
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:14,068
I love this guy!

772
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:21,617
Your ancestors are niggers.

773
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:25,079
Hey!

774
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:30,376
And your great, great, great...

775
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,004
great grandmother fucked a nigger.

776
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,426
And she had a half-nigger kid. Now...

777
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,638
if that is a fact, tell me?

778
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:45,141
Am I lying?

779
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:50,646
'Cause you...

780
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:55,151
you are part eggplant.

781
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,119
Egg! Egg! Egg!

782
00:57:06,245 --> 00:57:07,789
You are a cantaloupe.

783
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:20,176
That was beautiful.

784
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:44,200
I haven't killed anybody...

785
00:57:45,117 --> 00:57:46,536
since 1984.

786
00:57:50,248 --> 00:57:52,625
Go to this comedian's son's apartment.

787
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:56,921
Come back with something that tells me
where that asshole went.

788
00:57:57,463 --> 00:57:59,632
So I can wipe this egg off my face.

789
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:15,439
Fix this fucked-up family for good.

790
00:58:21,404 --> 00:58:22,488
Hey, Boss.

791
00:58:23,865 --> 00:58:25,449
Get ready to be happy.

792
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:31,354
'Morning, everybody. It's 6:22 here in LA.
I'm David Perry at KBLU.

793
00:58:48,617 --> 00:58:51,077
Hello?

794
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:57,582
Floyd.

795
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:03,712
Can't you answer the door at least for me?

796
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:05,838
Oh, man, I didn't even hear it.

797
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,757
Hello?

798
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:10,258
Can't you help me every now and then?

799
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:12,177
Yes.

800
00:59:13,803 --> 00:59:15,804
- You call for a date?
- Huh?

801
00:59:18,557 --> 00:59:19,974
I knew it was you!

802
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:23,935
Dick, this is Alabama.
Alabama, this is Dick.

803
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,187
Nice to meet you!

804
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,564
- How long have you lived here?
- I'm Alabama.

805
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:29,982
- You look good!
- This is a great place.

806
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,108
I'm starving. Let's get something to eat.

807
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,027
- Who's this?
- This is Floyd.

808
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,028
Let's go! Come on!

809
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:40,365
Hey.

810
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,294
Hey. I didn't tell you guys yet?

811
00:59:56,379 --> 01:00:00,298
I had this really, really good audition
for T.J. Hooker the other day.

812
01:00:01,006 --> 01:00:04,175
- You're going to be on T.J. Hooker?
- Yeah, the new T.J. Hooker.

813
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:05,259
Knock on wood.

814
01:00:05,386 --> 01:00:08,930
- You get to meet Captain Kirk?
- You don't meet him in the audition...

815
01:00:09,013 --> 01:00:11,473
but if I get the part, hope, hope....

816
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:14,809
- That would be amazing.
- It'd be cool....

817
01:00:14,892 --> 01:00:17,435
Meeting Captain Kirk, that would be cool.

818
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:28,695
Here we are.

819
01:00:31,572 --> 01:00:33,073
The honeymoon suite.

820
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:37,535
You're really in love, aren't you?

821
01:00:37,618 --> 01:00:41,705
For the very first time in my life.
Know what that's like?

822
01:00:41,788 --> 01:00:42,579
No.

823
01:00:44,582 --> 01:00:45,249
No.

824
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,709
Shut the fuck up.

825
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:49,335
What are you doing in LA anyway, huh?

826
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,843
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This shit can't be real.

827
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:02,262
- It'll get you high.
- What?

828
01:01:02,513 --> 01:01:03,847
I said, it'll get you high.

829
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,347
Hey, we got cable.

830
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:07,683
Want some wine, sweetheart?

831
01:01:07,767 --> 01:01:10,811
Yeah, just a little bit,
I'm not much of a wine gal.

832
01:01:11,979 --> 01:01:13,771
That stuff is fucking real.

833
01:01:14,355 --> 01:01:15,856
This is fucking real, Clarence.

834
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,441
I certainly hope so.

835
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:20,484
You've got a hell of a lot
of cocaine here, man.

836
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:21,611
I know.

837
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:23,945
Do you realize how much coke you have?

838
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,196
No, tell me.

839
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,782
I don't know, but it's a fucking lot!

840
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:31,952
This is DrexI's coke.

841
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:34,829
No, Drexl is dead, you see.
It's Clarence's coke.

842
01:01:34,954 --> 01:01:38,874
And he can do whatever he wants with it.
What Clarence wants to do is to sell it.

843
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,669
Then, we'll jump on a plane and spend
the rest of our lives spending it.

844
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:45,546
You got my letter?
You lined up a buyer for me?

845
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,130
I'm not Joe Cocaine, okay?

846
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:48,298
You're an actor.

847
01:01:48,423 --> 01:01:51,050
I hear these Hollywood guys
get it delivered to the set.

848
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:53,385
Well, they do. All right? They do.

849
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,720
Maybe one day,
when I'm a successful actor...

850
01:01:55,804 --> 01:01:57,388
I'll be like one of them.

851
01:01:57,472 --> 01:02:00,265
But, until that day,
I don't have anything. All right?

852
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,143
I don't have a pot to piss in,
or a window to throw it out.

853
01:02:03,226 --> 01:02:04,769
All I got is fucking Floyd.

854
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:08,147
If you want me to help you sell
a bit at a time that's all I can do.

855
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,398
No. None of that bit-at-a-time shit.

856
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:13,400
It's got to be the whole enchilada
in one shot.

857
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:16,278
Clarence, do you have any idea
how difficult that'll be?

858
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:18,071
What the fuck you are talking about?

859
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:21,783
I'm offering $500,000 worth of white
for $200,000. That'll be difficult?

860
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:25,452
Very difficult.
That's very difficult, understand? Listen.

861
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,288
It's difficult because you're selling
to a particular group, understand?

862
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,749
Fat cats, big shots.
Guys who can afford $200,000.

863
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,584
Guys who can use a whole suitcase
full of cocaine.

864
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,753
Basically, Clarence, guys I don't know.

865
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:41,673
And guys you don't know. And more
importantly, they don't know you.

866
01:02:45,802 --> 01:02:47,052
Come on, Dick.

867
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,890
Okay, Clarence.

868
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,725
Listen.

869
01:02:57,186 --> 01:02:59,020
There's one guy that I know...

870
01:02:59,105 --> 01:03:01,356
that can help you out, Clarence, but...

871
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:03,899
I'm not guaranteeing you anything.

872
01:03:04,525 --> 01:03:05,900
Is he big-league?

873
01:03:07,361 --> 01:03:09,696
He's not big-league. Okay?

874
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,616
But he works as an assistant to a very
big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

875
01:03:15,367 --> 01:03:17,285
Lee Donowitz could afford...

876
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:20,036
and can use, $200,000-worth of coke.

877
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:22,998
Being that that's what you have.

878
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:25,332
All right, so what did you tell him?

879
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:27,960
What the fuck do you expect me
to tell him?

880
01:03:28,043 --> 01:03:30,503
I didn't know what was bullshit
and what wasn't.

881
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:34,172
And besides, Floyd smoked
the second page of the letter. Okay?

882
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:37,134
What's this acting-class guy's name?

883
01:03:37,551 --> 01:03:38,551
Elliot.

884
01:03:39,677 --> 01:03:40,844
Elliot what?

885
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:42,387
Elliot Blitzer.

886
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:46,141
We'll get him on the phone
and arrange a meeting...

887
01:03:46,266 --> 01:03:50,269
so we can get through all this
getting-to-know-you stuff, all right?

888
01:03:50,686 --> 01:03:51,644
Where?

889
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:53,938
Where should we meet?

890
01:03:57,191 --> 01:03:58,066
Roller coaster.

891
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,483
Roller coasters.

892
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:08,116
So, you have $500,000-worth of cola
that you are unloading for $200,000.

893
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:12,286
You want an animal cracker?

894
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:14,495
Thanks.

895
01:04:15,538 --> 01:04:17,789
Wait, save the gorillas.

896
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,460
Thanks.

897
01:04:22,753 --> 01:04:24,253
So, you got...

898
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:26,838
$500,000-worth of cola...

899
01:04:27,006 --> 01:04:29,382
that you're unloading for $200,000.

900
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:33,552
"Unloading". That's a hell of a way
to describe a bargain of a lifetime.

901
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:36,679
- Where did you get it?
- Where did I get it?

902
01:04:37,972 --> 01:04:41,058
I grow it on my windowsill.
The light is really good there.

903
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:44,478
I'm up high enough off the street so,
you know, you can't see it.

904
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:45,728
It works perfectly.

905
01:04:45,812 --> 01:04:46,812
Yeah.

906
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:50,982
Where, really, where does it come from?

907
01:04:51,066 --> 01:04:52,399
Where does it come from?

908
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:53,567
Coco leaves.

909
01:04:53,693 --> 01:04:55,319
You're sick. I'm out of here.

910
01:04:55,402 --> 01:04:56,903
Elliot, chill out.

911
01:04:56,987 --> 01:04:59,072
Come on, sit down here. All right?

912
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:01,074
We're here, so let's enjoy the ride.

913
01:05:01,157 --> 01:05:03,951
I'll tell you.
You have to promise you'll keep it quiet.

914
01:05:04,035 --> 01:05:07,955
If Dick hadn't told me you're good people,
I'd say it's none of your business.

915
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,747
This is going to be fun.

916
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,790
Let's go!

917
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,919
The truth of the matter is this:
I got a friend in the department.

918
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:17,086
What department?

919
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:19,922
What department?
What do you think, eight ball?

920
01:05:21,548 --> 01:05:22,715
The police department?

921
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,634
Give the man a prize!
About a year and a half ago...

922
01:05:25,718 --> 01:05:27,886
my friend got access
to the evidence room.

923
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,805
He snagged this coke, but he's a good cop
with a family.

924
01:05:30,888 --> 01:05:34,307
He had it for a year and a half
'til he found a guy he could trust.

925
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:35,392
And he trusts you?

926
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:39,353
He trusts me, we were in 4-H together.
We've known each other since childhood.

927
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:41,564
I handle sales, he's my silent partner.

928
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:44,315
He knows, if I get fucked up,
I won't drop dime on him.

929
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,149
Okay? No further, you understand?

930
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,694
He's kind of paranoid,
I didn't tell you nothing.

931
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:51,445
- You didn't hear anything.
- I didn't hear anything.

932
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,239
All right! Here we go!

933
01:05:59,077 --> 01:06:00,494
Ride it out, baby!

934
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:12,004
Yeah!

935
01:06:13,046 --> 01:06:16,153
We're going in for another one!
Hang on, Elliot!

936
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:35,050
Oh, yeah, we got this puppy.
This was a good idea.

937
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:44,098
Elliot looks a little green.

938
01:06:49,394 --> 01:06:52,355
Do I look like a beautiful blond
with big tits and an ass...

939
01:06:52,438 --> 01:06:55,148
that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

940
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:57,107
What?

941
01:06:57,192 --> 01:07:00,653
I said, do I look like a beautiful
blond with big tits and an ass...

942
01:07:00,736 --> 01:07:02,945
that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

943
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:03,863
No.

944
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:06,199
No. Then why are you telling me
this bullshit?

945
01:07:06,282 --> 01:07:08,241
What, do you want to fuck me?

946
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:09,618
Clarence.

947
01:07:09,743 --> 01:07:10,910
He's sick, man.

948
01:07:11,036 --> 01:07:12,828
Let me handle this, all right?

949
01:07:12,913 --> 01:07:14,997
Look. You know what?
Just get it straight.

950
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:18,416
Lee is not into taking risks, okay?

951
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:22,711
He's got a couple of guys,
he's been dealing with them for years.

952
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:27,007
They're reliable, they're dependable,
and they're safe.

953
01:07:28,175 --> 01:07:29,801
"Riddle me this, Batman".

954
01:07:29,885 --> 01:07:32,512
If you're so much in love,
what are you doing here?

955
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:37,098
I'm sure you've got better things to do
than hanging around on a roller coaster.

956
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,559
Your guy is interested because
with that much shit...

957
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:43,770
he could play Joe-fucking-Hollywood
until the wheels come off.

958
01:07:43,854 --> 01:07:45,647
He can sell it, he can snort it...

959
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:48,190
he can play Santa Claus with it.

960
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:51,402
At the price he's paying
he'll be able to throw it around.

961
01:07:51,485 --> 01:07:53,611
He'll be everybody's best friend.

962
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:55,488
I'm not putting him down.

963
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,614
It's his money, let him do what he wants.

964
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,783
But don't expect us to hang around...

965
01:07:59,866 --> 01:08:02,952
waiting for you guys
to grow some guts, all right?

966
01:08:03,244 --> 01:08:04,035
Jesus.

967
01:08:06,831 --> 01:08:07,998
Yeah, hello.

968
01:08:08,873 --> 01:08:09,707
Hi, Lee.

969
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:13,460
Elliot, it's Sunday. Can you tell me
why I'm talking to you on Sunday?

970
01:08:13,544 --> 01:08:16,212
Don't I see enough of you all week?

971
01:08:16,296 --> 01:08:19,965
I'm with that party that you wanted me
to get together with, Lee.

972
01:08:20,216 --> 01:08:21,550
You know who I'm talking about?

973
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:24,260
I don't believe this.
Why are you talking to me...

974
01:08:24,344 --> 01:08:26,137
on my phone about that?

975
01:08:26,304 --> 01:08:30,973
Well, because I'm standing with the guy,
and he insists on talking to you.

976
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:33,809
What, are you out of your fucking mind?

977
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:39,939
He said that if I didn't get you
on the phone, that he would leave....

978
01:08:40,064 --> 01:08:42,816
Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last, we speak.

979
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,609
First, I want to tell you
I'm a big fan of yours.

980
01:08:45,694 --> 01:08:48,070
That's why I want to open
Dr. Zhivago in LA.

981
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:51,156
And I need you and your abilities
to distribute it.

982
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:54,617
I don't know.

983
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:56,702
Dr. Zhivago is a pretty big movie.

984
01:08:56,785 --> 01:09:00,371
The biggest movie you've dealt with.
We're talking a lot of film here.

985
01:09:00,456 --> 01:09:04,626
A man would be an idiot not to be
a little cautious about a movie like that.

986
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:06,501
And, Lee, you're no idiot.

987
01:09:06,835 --> 01:09:08,961
I'm not saying I'm not interested.

988
01:09:09,046 --> 01:09:11,255
It's just, being a distributor
is not what I do.

989
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:13,214
I'm a movie producer, you know?

990
01:09:13,299 --> 01:09:15,467
I'm here to make good movies,
nothing more...

991
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,760
and nothing, well,
maybe less, sometimes.

992
01:09:17,844 --> 01:09:18,927
Hey!

993
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:21,387
Choose a fucking lane!

994
01:09:22,806 --> 01:09:25,433
Not you, just an idiot...
Don't give me the finger!

995
01:09:25,516 --> 01:09:27,476
I'll fucking have you killed!

996
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,269
So, bottom line is I'm not Paramount.

997
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:31,604
You know what I'm saying?

998
01:09:31,688 --> 01:09:33,522
I got a select few distributors.

999
01:09:33,606 --> 01:09:37,692
I buy their little movies and I accomplish
what I want and I get out of there.

1000
01:09:37,776 --> 01:09:40,778
Very business-like, very easy,
and very little risk.

1001
01:09:40,862 --> 01:09:44,281
We're talking Dr. Zhivago.
It'll be packing them in. For a year...

1002
01:09:44,365 --> 01:09:48,117
two years you won't have to deal
with anybody else's movie but mine.

1003
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:51,203
Nobody's but yours.
Well, what's the rush here?

1004
01:09:51,703 --> 01:09:54,246
I want to be able to announce
the deal at Cannes.

1005
01:09:54,331 --> 01:09:56,374
If I had time for a courtship, I would.

1006
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:59,209
I'd take you out, hold your hand,
kiss your cheek.

1007
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:00,542
But I'm not in that position.

1008
01:10:00,669 --> 01:10:04,254
I need to know right now if you
and I are in bed together or not.

1009
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:06,506
If you want my movie,
you must come to terms...

1010
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:08,508
with your fear and desire.

1011
01:10:09,467 --> 01:10:11,677
Fear and desire, huh, Clarence?

1012
01:10:13,387 --> 01:10:16,889
Don't you know that my films have
grossed more than $2.8 billion?

1013
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:17,973
Let me talk to Elliot.

1014
01:10:18,099 --> 01:10:21,142
- You want to talk to Elliot?
- Let me talk to Elliot.

1015
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:23,769
Elliot. He wants to talk to you.

1016
01:10:26,063 --> 01:10:27,021
Hi, Lee.

1017
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:29,357
Elliot, where do you know this guy from?

1018
01:10:29,441 --> 01:10:31,734
He's a friend of Dick's, remember?

1019
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:33,568
Who the fuck is Dick?

1020
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:39,573
You want me to suck his dick?

1021
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:41,491
Who the fuck is Dick?

1022
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,201
Oh, who the fuck is Dick?

1023
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:44,035
Yeah.

1024
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,953
My friend. He's in my acting class.

1025
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:47,121
You told him I'm an actor?

1026
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:50,916
Is he any good?
ls he talented, or...? Really?

1027
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,418
How does Dick know this guy?

1028
01:10:55,211 --> 01:10:56,628
They grew up together.

1029
01:10:56,713 --> 01:10:59,590
Okay, Wednesday at the hotel, 3:00.

1030
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:01,257
Bring the whole fucking cast.

1031
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,385
Elliot, don't call me here anymore,
especially not on Sunday, all right?

1032
01:11:06,344 --> 01:11:07,678
What did he say?

1033
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:09,972
Just hold on. Shut up for a second.

1034
01:11:10,056 --> 01:11:12,600
Hey, you guys.
This is what's going to happen.

1035
01:11:12,683 --> 01:11:16,519
Three o'clock, Beverly Ambassador,
he wants to see everybody. Okay?

1036
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:20,397
And, he'll talk to you.
If after talking to you he likes you...

1037
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,189
he'll deal with you.

1038
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:25,651
If he doesn't, he'll say, "Fuck you,"
and walk out of the room.

1039
01:11:25,735 --> 01:11:28,069
- Did you tell him I was a...?
- Shut up.

1040
01:11:28,153 --> 01:11:29,945
And he wants a sample bag.

1041
01:11:30,322 --> 01:11:31,405
No problem on all counts.

1042
01:11:31,531 --> 01:11:32,615
Great.

1043
01:11:32,865 --> 01:11:34,907
Did you tell him I was an actor?

1044
01:11:35,034 --> 01:11:36,367
Yes, I told him.

1045
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:38,077
You told him I was good?

1046
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:39,328
Yeah, I lied.

1047
01:11:56,217 --> 01:11:56,967
Hi.

1048
01:11:57,052 --> 01:11:58,969
- How are you doing?
- Oh, pretty good.

1049
01:11:59,054 --> 01:12:01,055
- Dick? Dick Richie?
- No.

1050
01:12:01,305 --> 01:12:03,222
No, he's not here right now.

1051
01:12:05,224 --> 01:12:06,475
You live here?

1052
01:12:06,643 --> 01:12:07,726
Yes, I do.

1053
01:12:08,352 --> 01:12:10,186
You're sort of roommates?

1054
01:12:11,021 --> 01:12:12,021
Exactly.

1055
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:15,482
Maybe you can help me,
I'm looking for a friend.

1056
01:12:15,566 --> 01:12:16,191
Sure.

1057
01:12:16,275 --> 01:12:17,692
Clarence Worley from Detroit?

1058
01:12:17,776 --> 01:12:19,860
He's hanging with a pretty girl
named Alabama?

1059
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:22,321
Yeah, I know them. They've been by here.

1060
01:12:22,446 --> 01:12:23,613
- You've seen them?
- Yes.

1061
01:12:23,697 --> 01:12:24,864
Are they staying here?

1062
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:26,866
No, they're staying at the...

1063
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:30,661
Safari Motor, Motel Inn. Safari Motel.

1064
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:34,038
- Safari Motel.
- Yes.

1065
01:12:35,456 --> 01:12:38,541
How do you know that? I mean,
have you been over there?

1066
01:12:38,626 --> 01:12:43,295
No, they were here,
and they said they were going to go there.

1067
01:12:45,005 --> 01:12:46,256
Then they went.

1068
01:12:47,258 --> 01:12:49,384
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Safari Motel.

1069
01:12:49,634 --> 01:12:50,884
Safari Motel.

1070
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,137
You want to watch some TV or something?
They might be back.

1071
01:12:54,221 --> 01:12:55,805
No, thank you.

1072
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:56,806
Okay.

1073
01:12:57,348 --> 01:12:58,807
You take care, I might be back.

1074
01:12:58,891 --> 01:13:00,684
Yeah, man. Okay, be cool.

1075
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,191
Don't be condescending to me, man.
I'll fucking kill you, man.

1076
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:20,408
I'm so proud of you.
Did I do my part okay?

1077
01:13:20,533 --> 01:13:21,700
Alabama, you were perfect.

1078
01:13:21,784 --> 01:13:22,951
Like a ninja?

1079
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:24,035
Like a ninja.

1080
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:26,662
I'm going to go grab us something to eat.

1081
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:30,833
I'll go jump in the tub and get all wet,
and slippery, and soapy.

1082
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:34,043
And hop onto that waterbed.
And watch X-rated movies...

1083
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:37,170
until you get your ass
back into my loving arms.

1084
01:13:39,673 --> 01:13:41,007
Hurry back now.

1085
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,724
We now return to Bullit
already in progress.

1086
01:14:03,358 --> 01:14:04,191
Hi.

1087
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,861
Hi!

1088
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,453
Cigarette?

1089
01:14:19,162 --> 01:14:20,162
No.

1090
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,959
That's a very nice outfit.

1091
01:14:28,794 --> 01:14:29,794
This?

1092
01:14:30,338 --> 01:14:33,340
I got this in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1093
01:14:44,223 --> 01:14:47,141
Alabama, where's our coke?
And where's Clarence?

1094
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,435
When's he coming back?

1095
01:14:51,437 --> 01:14:53,980
I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong room.

1096
01:14:54,105 --> 01:14:55,481
My name is Sadie.

1097
01:14:57,858 --> 01:15:01,611
We don't have any Coke,
but there's a Pepsi machine down the hall.

1098
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:05,656
I don't know anybody named Clarence.
Perhaps my husband does.

1099
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:09,660
You can ask him because he'll be home
in a minute. He plays football.

1100
01:15:11,869 --> 01:15:13,453
He's just at practice.

1101
01:15:23,337 --> 01:15:24,754
Give me your hand.

1102
01:15:25,255 --> 01:15:26,255
Okay.

1103
01:15:32,511 --> 01:15:34,303
You are unbelievably cute.

1104
01:15:35,513 --> 01:15:37,514
Thank you. Thanks.

1105
01:15:40,225 --> 01:15:41,809
Let me see those eyes.

1106
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:46,020
What a face.

1107
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,400
Do me a favor. Turn around for me.

1108
01:15:51,775 --> 01:15:52,775
Okay.

1109
01:15:53,777 --> 01:15:55,319
No, go the other way.

1110
01:15:56,445 --> 01:15:57,445
Okay.

1111
01:16:15,836 --> 01:16:17,420
That hurts, don't it?

1112
01:16:18,505 --> 01:16:21,507
Get on your feet, sweetie.
You ain't hurt that bad.

1113
01:16:23,509 --> 01:16:26,052
Now, where's our coke? Where's Clarence?

1114
01:16:26,512 --> 01:16:28,305
And when's he comin' back?

1115
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:31,432
Okay.

1116
01:16:34,476 --> 01:16:35,476
Fuck you.

1117
01:16:37,604 --> 01:16:38,687
Fuck me....

1118
01:16:46,152 --> 01:16:48,111
What's the matter, baby, huh?

1119
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:50,696
Can't breathe?

1120
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:56,993
You better get used to that.

1121
01:16:59,245 --> 01:17:00,204
Hi.

1122
01:17:00,288 --> 01:17:01,538
Smells like hamburgers here.

1123
01:17:01,623 --> 01:17:04,666
Tell me, what is the biggest,
baddest hamburger you guys got?

1124
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,751
Steve's Double Chili Cheeseburger.

1125
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:08,793
Give me two of them bad boys.

1126
01:17:09,295 --> 01:17:11,004
Two chili fries. And...

1127
01:17:11,088 --> 01:17:12,797
two large Diet Cokes.

1128
01:17:13,507 --> 01:17:14,757
Anything else?

1129
01:17:17,593 --> 01:17:18,510
Come here.

1130
01:17:18,594 --> 01:17:20,345
Look at yourself! Take a good look!

1131
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:22,471
Think your boyfriend
would go for that shit?

1132
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,307
If you do you're fucking stupid.
You know that?

1133
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,058
You're a very pretty girl.

1134
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,352
But you won't be very pretty for very long.

1135
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:33,605
I'll ask you a fucking question.
And you give me the right fucking answer!

1136
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:35,689
Now...

1137
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:38,400
where's my coke?

1138
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:46,073
Turn around. Turn around!

1139
01:17:47,574 --> 01:17:48,658
Answer me!

1140
01:17:53,704 --> 01:17:54,704
Come on.

1141
01:18:00,126 --> 01:18:02,044
You got a lot of heart, kid.

1142
01:18:05,129 --> 01:18:07,047
Yeah, that is a great issue.

1143
01:18:07,924 --> 01:18:10,259
You gotten to the story on Elvis yet?

1144
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:12,635
No. I hadn't.

1145
01:18:13,637 --> 01:18:17,557
That's probably the best piece
I've read on Elvis Presley in my entire life.

1146
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:18,890
Look at this.

1147
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:21,225
See, it tries to pin down...

1148
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:24,061
what the attraction is
after all these years.

1149
01:18:24,144 --> 01:18:27,063
It covers the whole spectrum.
Talks to the fans...

1150
01:18:27,397 --> 01:18:29,940
people who grew up with him
and love his music.

1151
01:18:30,024 --> 01:18:32,192
Then, there's the fanatics. Right?

1152
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:35,695
I don't know about you,
but they give me the creeps.

1153
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:38,405
Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.

1154
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:39,990
I mean, look at her.

1155
01:18:40,074 --> 01:18:43,577
Looks like she fell off the ugly tree
and hit every branch on the way down.

1156
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:54,626
Now the first time you kill somebody,
that's the hardest.

1157
01:18:56,795 --> 01:19:00,548
I don't give a shit if you're fuckin' wired up,
or Jack the Ripper.

1158
01:19:06,386 --> 01:19:07,553
Remember that guy in Texas?

1159
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:10,930
The guy up in that fucking tower,
killed all them people?

1160
01:19:11,599 --> 01:19:15,101
I bet you green money,
the first little black dot he took a beat on...

1161
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:17,352
that was the bitch of the bunch.

1162
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,981
First one is tough. No fucking fooling.

1163
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:25,192
The second one
ain't no fuckin' Mardi Gras...

1164
01:19:25,275 --> 01:19:28,819
but it's better than the first
'cause you still feel the same thing...

1165
01:19:28,904 --> 01:19:30,279
except it's more diluted.

1166
01:19:30,362 --> 01:19:32,405
You know, it's better.

1167
01:19:33,616 --> 01:19:36,326
I threw up on the first one,
you believe that?

1168
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:39,077
Then the third one.

1169
01:19:39,703 --> 01:19:42,330
The third one is easy, you level right off.

1170
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:47,918
That's no problem. Now.... Shit!

1171
01:19:49,711 --> 01:19:53,088
Now, I do it just to watch
their fuckin' expression change.

1172
01:20:02,054 --> 01:20:03,846
I don't fuckin' believe it.

1173
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:07,891
Did you put it under the bed?

1174
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,975
Yes.

1175
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:15,022
I can't believe it.
You put it under the fucking bed.

1176
01:20:15,105 --> 01:20:17,315
I didn't look under the fuckin' bed.

1177
01:20:21,736 --> 01:20:23,487
I can't believe you put it there.

1178
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:25,947
I can't believe I didn't look under the bed.

1179
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,740
I'm getting fucking old.

1180
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,784
Journey's end baby.

1181
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:33,203
Snow at the end of the rainbow.

1182
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,457
One less thing I gotta fucking worry about.

1183
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:49,967
This is it, baby.

1184
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,094
Moment of truth.

1185
01:21:02,853 --> 01:21:05,479
You got a lot of heart, kid, you know that?

1186
01:21:07,523 --> 01:21:08,898
You want to play?

1187
01:21:09,524 --> 01:21:11,608
Huh? ls that what you want?

1188
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,694
You want to play with Daddy?

1189
01:21:14,778 --> 01:21:18,030
Come on. Come on I'll give you one shot
because I like you.

1190
01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:20,949
Stick it in me, baby.
Come on stick it in Daddy.

1191
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:24,743
Stick it in me. Go ahead.

1192
01:21:25,036 --> 01:21:26,036
Come on!

1193
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,120
Come on!

1194
01:21:34,793 --> 01:21:35,960
Motherfucker!

1195
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,763
All right. No more Mr. Fucking Nice Guy.

1196
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:52,140
Oh, God!

1197
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:01,981
What do you think of that?

1198
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:04,733
What do you think about that, baby?

1199
01:22:04,817 --> 01:22:06,067
Wait! Wait!

1200
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:08,068
What?

1201
01:22:09,404 --> 01:22:10,738
Why the fuck are you laughing?

1202
01:22:10,821 --> 01:22:12,530
You look ridiculous!

1203
01:22:17,076 --> 01:22:18,827
Come here! I look fucking ridiculous!

1204
01:22:18,911 --> 01:22:20,453
Get up! Laugh it up!

1205
01:22:20,537 --> 01:22:22,079
Come on, laugh it up!

1206
01:22:22,539 --> 01:22:24,624
You were in hysterics a minute ago,
so laugh!

1207
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:25,791
You like that, don't you?

1208
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:26,958
Fuck you!

1209
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,210
Shit!

1210
01:23:29,258 --> 01:23:30,258
Fuck!

1211
01:23:30,508 --> 01:23:34,428
Motherfucker! Alabama, we gotta go!
Jesus Christ!

1212
01:23:34,637 --> 01:23:37,180
Come on, darling.
We gotta get the fuck out of here!

1213
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:39,682
Come on.

1214
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,434
The cops are gonna be here
any fucking second!

1215
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:43,518
Fuck!

1216
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:44,936
Fuck, come on!

1217
01:24:01,574 --> 01:24:02,574
Fuck!

1218
01:24:04,493 --> 01:24:08,079
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1219
01:24:10,081 --> 01:24:11,623
Get the fuck out of the way!

1220
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:24,049
Oh, fuck!

1221
01:24:25,426 --> 01:24:26,259
Fuck!

1222
01:24:26,343 --> 01:24:28,178
- What?
- I don't fucking believe this!

1223
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:31,472
Goddamn it! I knew it! I fucking knew it!

1224
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:47,109
I should have my goddamn
head examined for driving like this.

1225
01:24:47,193 --> 01:24:48,943
Look Carla.... Kandi....

1226
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:50,612
Kandi, you've got to help me.

1227
01:24:50,737 --> 01:24:51,987
What can I do?

1228
01:24:52,363 --> 01:24:53,739
Take this. Hold this.

1229
01:24:53,823 --> 01:24:56,533
-What are you? High? No.
-Put this in your purse.

1230
01:24:56,617 --> 01:24:58,159
I won't put that shit in my purse.

1231
01:24:58,243 --> 01:25:00,036
He won't search you.

1232
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:02,746
- Now just put it in your bra!
- I'm not wearing one.

1233
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:06,583
Please, he's almost here!
Just fucking put it in your pants!

1234
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:08,167
No.

1235
01:25:08,709 --> 01:25:10,668
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.

1236
01:25:10,754 --> 01:25:12,671
Read my lips. No.

1237
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:15,381
Asshole.

1238
01:25:15,466 --> 01:25:19,469
- After all I did for you, you whore!
- Who the fuck do you think you...?

1239
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,224
Hi.

1240
01:25:26,808 --> 01:25:30,435
Look, dickhead. It's your bad luck
that we caught you speeding...

1241
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,647
and it's your bad luck that
you had a bag of uncut cocaine.

1242
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:35,981
- Not a little vial.
- A fucking baggy.

1243
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:37,732
Hey, you got caught.

1244
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,276
It's all fun until you get caught.
Now we got you.

1245
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:43,529
Okay, Mr. Elliot, fucking actor,
you just made the big time.

1246
01:25:43,613 --> 01:25:45,823
- You're no longer an extra...
- A bit player.

1247
01:25:45,906 --> 01:25:47,073
a supporting actor.

1248
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:48,950
You're a fucking star.

1249
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:50,951
You'll be playing your one-man show...

1250
01:25:51,035 --> 01:25:53,578
nightly for the next two fucking years!

1251
01:25:53,745 --> 01:25:55,121
For a captive audience.

1252
01:25:55,205 --> 01:25:57,998
You'll get out in a few years
and meet some old lady.

1253
01:25:58,082 --> 01:26:01,042
You'll marry and be understanding
to your wife's needs...

1254
01:26:01,127 --> 01:26:03,753
because you'll know
what it's like to be a woman.

1255
01:26:03,837 --> 01:26:07,506
You'll only want to fuck her ass
'cause her pussy won't be tight enough.

1256
01:26:07,589 --> 01:26:09,632
Good point, Detective. Right?

1257
01:26:09,716 --> 01:26:10,967
Fucking faggot!

1258
01:26:11,467 --> 01:26:15,679
Krinkle, this is it, and it's all ours.
I mean, talk about falling into something....

1259
01:26:15,762 --> 01:26:17,847
Would you shut up!
I can't understand shit.

1260
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:20,307
What happened?
What are you talking about?

1261
01:26:20,433 --> 01:26:21,808
Okay, all right.

1262
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:24,185
Patrol car pulls a guy over for speeding.

1263
01:26:24,269 --> 01:26:25,686
Suspect is covered with coke...

1264
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:28,147
so they bring him to me and Nicholson.

1265
01:26:28,273 --> 01:26:29,648
Nicholson and l.

1266
01:26:30,607 --> 01:26:32,483
What's the difference?

1267
01:26:32,568 --> 01:26:33,818
We go to work on him.

1268
01:26:33,943 --> 01:26:35,986
We know something is strange 'cause he...

1269
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:39,990
is fucking stupid, and he's got
a big bag of coke, and it's uncut.

1270
01:26:40,323 --> 01:26:42,616
And you won't believe
what he's got to say.

1271
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,660
Seems a cop from some department,
stole...

1272
01:26:45,745 --> 01:26:48,204
$500,000 worth of coke
from the property cage....

1273
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:50,372
He sat on the shit for a year and a half.

1274
01:26:50,457 --> 01:26:53,208
- Now, the cop's got this weirdo...
- Suspect's words.

1275
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:54,375
to front for him.

1276
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,087
Our guy, Elliot Blitzer, is making a deal
between them and his boss...

1277
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:01,131
big-time fucking movie producer
named Lee Donowitz.

1278
01:27:01,214 --> 01:27:03,132
He did Coming Home in a Body Bag.

1279
01:27:03,216 --> 01:27:04,383
A Vietnam movie?

1280
01:27:04,467 --> 01:27:06,051
- Yeah.
- Good fucking movie.

1281
01:27:06,135 --> 01:27:08,303
Fucking A. Great fucking movie.

1282
01:27:08,471 --> 01:27:09,846
So, do you believe him?

1283
01:27:09,929 --> 01:27:11,388
I believe he believes him.

1284
01:27:11,473 --> 01:27:13,182
This guy is too rattled to be lying.

1285
01:27:13,265 --> 01:27:16,059
He'd roll over on his mom, dad,
his two-pantied granny...

1286
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:18,853
and the King of Siam
if he had anything on him.

1287
01:27:18,936 --> 01:27:22,856
This guy was a sissy. This rabbit
will do anything not to do any time.

1288
01:27:22,981 --> 01:27:25,691
You know what he'll do? He'll wear a wire.

1289
01:27:26,193 --> 01:27:26,942
He'll wear a wire?

1290
01:27:27,026 --> 01:27:29,235
He'll wear a wire, we talked to him.

1291
01:27:31,529 --> 01:27:34,073
Dirty cops, we got to get
Internal Affairs on this.

1292
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:35,574
I don't care who you bring in.

1293
01:27:35,657 --> 01:27:37,658
You can bring in the state enlisted...

1294
01:27:37,743 --> 01:27:40,286
the ghost of Steve McQueen,
ten Roman gladiators.

1295
01:27:40,411 --> 01:27:43,705
I don't give a shit as long as me and Todd
get credit for the bust.

1296
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:46,458
Listen, we found him.
We just want the fucking collar.

1297
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:48,250
That's it. End of story.

1298
01:27:49,877 --> 01:27:51,044
You got it.

1299
01:27:56,216 --> 01:27:58,884
Did I ever tell you
how much I hate airports?

1300
01:28:00,969 --> 01:28:04,055
See, I used to live by one
back in Dearborn, you know.

1301
01:28:05,515 --> 01:28:09,434
Really frustrating living next to an airport
when you don't got shit.

1302
01:28:12,728 --> 01:28:16,189
And all day long I'm seeing
and hearing people doing exactly...

1303
01:28:16,272 --> 01:28:18,482
what I want to be doing, but couldn't.

1304
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:19,525
What?

1305
01:28:21,193 --> 01:28:25,488
Starting new lives, leaving Detroit,
vacations, business trips...

1306
01:28:27,532 --> 01:28:29,700
fun, fun, fun.

1307
01:28:34,995 --> 01:28:37,455
Knowing us, we can jump
on any of those planes...

1308
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,375
and go anywhere we want.
Gives me a whole new outlook.

1309
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:41,834
Love how it works out.

1310
01:28:41,918 --> 01:28:44,169
You're not kidding.
We got lives to start over.

1311
01:28:44,253 --> 01:28:47,422
We should go somewhere
where we can start from scratch.

1312
01:28:48,881 --> 01:28:50,716
I've been in America all my life.

1313
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,593
I'd like to see what TV
in other countries is like.

1314
01:28:53,677 --> 01:28:56,846
Where do you think we should go,
my little turtle dove?

1315
01:28:58,931 --> 01:28:59,931
Cancun.

1316
01:29:01,099 --> 01:29:02,558
Cancun, why Cancun?

1317
01:29:03,435 --> 01:29:06,437
It's got a nice ring to it.
Sounds like a movie.

1318
01:29:07,187 --> 01:29:10,148
Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancun,
don't you think?

1319
01:29:11,357 --> 01:29:13,900
In my movie, darling, you get top billing.

1320
01:29:16,236 --> 01:29:20,281
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
It's all going to work out for us.

1321
01:29:21,907 --> 01:29:23,158
We deserve it.

1322
01:29:35,793 --> 01:29:38,587
You sure that's how you get
to the Beverly Ambassador?

1323
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:40,922
Yeah, man, I'm positive.

1324
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:44,842
Let me tell you, if we get lost
that's your ass.

1325
01:29:44,925 --> 01:29:47,552
Why don't you get out of
my beer and get a fucking job?

1326
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:48,720
Yeah, okay.

1327
01:29:48,888 --> 01:29:50,472
- Can we go?
- We're out the door.

1328
01:29:50,555 --> 01:29:51,972
We must meet Elliot in the lobby.

1329
01:29:52,057 --> 01:29:53,599
I'll see we got everything.

1330
01:29:53,682 --> 01:29:55,641
You all right?

1331
01:29:57,770 --> 01:29:58,561
Yes.

1332
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:01,521
- I'm out, Floyd.
- Are you here? No, he's not here.

1333
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:02,773
Wait, wait, wait!

1334
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:04,023
Come on, Dick!

1335
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:05,649
Somebody here for me.

1336
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:06,984
Hello?

1337
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,819
Hey. Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin' out...

1338
01:30:09,945 --> 01:30:10,945
What?

1339
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:14,198
Serious?

1340
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:16,533
She said that?

1341
01:30:16,617 --> 01:30:18,284
What did she say? Come on, okay?

1342
01:30:18,369 --> 01:30:21,537
Yo, Catherine, thank you, thank you.

1343
01:30:23,122 --> 01:30:25,791
I'm going to talk to you tomorrow.
All right?

1344
01:30:28,043 --> 01:30:29,210
We got to go.

1345
01:30:32,046 --> 01:30:32,837
I got the part.

1346
01:30:32,922 --> 01:30:33,838
Wow!

1347
01:30:34,089 --> 01:30:35,255
I got the part.

1348
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:38,008
That's perfect. That's great.
That's wonderful.

1349
01:30:38,093 --> 01:30:40,010
Didn't even want a callback.

1350
01:30:43,054 --> 01:30:44,763
That's cool, way to go!

1351
01:30:45,765 --> 01:30:47,182
I got a 7:00 call.

1352
01:30:47,265 --> 01:30:49,141
That's great. Come on, let's go.

1353
01:30:49,226 --> 01:30:51,602
I want to hear all about it, okay? Come on.

1354
01:30:51,686 --> 01:30:52,936
Hey, Clarence!

1355
01:30:53,729 --> 01:30:54,604
What?

1356
01:30:57,774 --> 01:30:59,900
Nothing. Forget it.

1357
01:31:00,651 --> 01:31:02,110
All right, come on.

1358
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:06,364
Hey, get some beer...

1359
01:31:10,033 --> 01:31:12,034
and some cleaning products.

1360
01:31:23,252 --> 01:31:25,628
I'm losing a fucking fortune over here.

1361
01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:34,927
You talkin' to me, you fucking wop, you?

1362
01:31:57,612 --> 01:32:00,072
Put your jacket on. Put your jacket on.

1363
01:32:01,073 --> 01:32:02,157
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1364
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,826
Put your jacket on. One sleeve at a time.

1365
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:08,370
It's a big game, now, Elliot.

1366
01:32:09,204 --> 01:32:11,664
- It's okay, come on. You all right?
- No.

1367
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:15,917
Elliot, look at me. Look at me.
You comfortable?

1368
01:32:17,419 --> 01:32:19,045
Am I comfortable? I've got a...

1369
01:32:19,129 --> 01:32:22,465
like a, brick in my scrotum.

1370
01:32:22,757 --> 01:32:24,424
That's the best place for it, okay?

1371
01:32:24,508 --> 01:32:26,676
They won't search your balls.

1372
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,594
You think they might see this?

1373
01:32:28,678 --> 01:32:31,221
No. It's okay.
When you stand up, it'll be okay.

1374
01:32:31,347 --> 01:32:32,513
- Elliot.
- Yeah?

1375
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:33,848
Say something.

1376
01:32:35,099 --> 01:32:37,100
Okay. Hi. How are you?

1377
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:40,354
My name is Elliot,
and I'm with the Cub Scouts of America.

1378
01:32:40,437 --> 01:32:44,482
We're, we're selling uncut cocaine
to get to the jamboree.

1379
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:47,484
- Just talk regular, Elliot.
- I'm sorry.

1380
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:49,485
Elliot, stop fucking around.

1381
01:32:50,236 --> 01:32:51,904
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1382
01:32:51,987 --> 01:32:52,987
You get that shit?

1383
01:32:53,072 --> 01:32:56,199
Remember, we'll be right down the hall
monitoring you.

1384
01:32:56,408 --> 01:32:58,951
And if somebody does something
you can't hear...

1385
01:32:59,077 --> 01:33:01,119
like puts a gun to my fucking eye?

1386
01:33:01,203 --> 01:33:04,455
- We've done this a thousand times.
- We know what we're doing.

1387
01:33:04,539 --> 01:33:08,042
Okay? We're the best at....
Now, listen. No fucking around.

1388
01:33:08,209 --> 01:33:11,169
Anything happens, we'll be there
like fucking gangbusters, ok?

1389
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:12,419
You must remember something.

1390
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:15,381
You don't want to go to jail, right?

1391
01:33:15,464 --> 01:33:17,131
No. I don't want to go to jail.

1392
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:18,466
So, what do we got to do?

1393
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,927
We got to put your boss in jail, okay?

1394
01:33:21,552 --> 01:33:25,472
You do that, and you got to show in court,
beyond any reasonable doubt...

1395
01:33:25,555 --> 01:33:28,474
that this respectable man
in the Hollywood community...

1396
01:33:28,557 --> 01:33:29,516
is dealing cocaine.

1397
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,643
We must prove it, and you must do it.

1398
01:33:31,727 --> 01:33:32,978
That's what we're doing here.

1399
01:33:33,061 --> 01:33:35,354
You're going to be okay,
you won't get hurt.

1400
01:33:35,438 --> 01:33:37,731
Okay? So what you got to do
is to get him...

1401
01:33:37,815 --> 01:33:40,108
to admit on tape, all right?

1402
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:43,527
That he's buying this coke. Okay, champ?

1403
01:33:43,611 --> 01:33:45,612
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Okay.

1404
01:33:46,321 --> 01:33:48,239
I'm going to get some coffee.

1405
01:33:52,118 --> 01:33:54,494
Alabama, you really got that
playing basketball?

1406
01:33:54,619 --> 01:33:57,162
Yes, I got an elbow right in the eye.
Then...

1407
01:33:57,247 --> 01:33:59,540
I got hurled the ball
when I'm not looking.

1408
01:33:59,623 --> 01:34:00,623
Wham!

1409
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:02,166
Right in my face.

1410
01:34:02,293 --> 01:34:03,918
You should be careful.

1411
01:34:04,919 --> 01:34:06,003
I should.

1412
01:34:19,265 --> 01:34:21,349
What the fuck did you bring that for?

1413
01:34:21,433 --> 01:34:22,433
In case.

1414
01:34:23,435 --> 01:34:24,518
In case of what?

1415
01:34:24,644 --> 01:34:26,937
I don't know, what do you want me to say?

1416
01:34:27,021 --> 01:34:29,772
Look, Clarence,
Lee Donowitz is not a pimp.

1417
01:34:30,189 --> 01:34:33,108
I know that, but one thing
this week has taught me...

1418
01:34:33,192 --> 01:34:37,945
it's better to have a gun and not need it
than to need a gun and not have it.

1419
01:34:43,658 --> 01:34:44,908
There he is.

1420
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:56,793
Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail.

1421
01:34:57,628 --> 01:34:59,003
Easy, easy, easy.

1422
01:34:59,963 --> 01:35:02,506
- Hi.
- Hi.

1423
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,802
- I guess it's about that time.
- Yeah.

1424
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:10,971
Here we go.

1425
01:35:20,312 --> 01:35:22,563
You're an actor. Act, motherfucker.

1426
01:35:28,985 --> 01:35:30,402
- Elliot.
- Yeah?

1427
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:33,614
Get on your knees.

1428
01:35:33,697 --> 01:35:34,697
Oh, no.

1429
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:35,990
What?

1430
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:38,910
- I said get on your knees!
- What the fuck?

1431
01:35:38,993 --> 01:35:41,745
Shut the fuck up!
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

1432
01:35:41,828 --> 01:35:44,747
You think I'm pretty fucking stupid,
don't you? Don't you?

1433
01:35:44,831 --> 01:35:47,625
No? Don't you fucking lie to me,
you motherfucker!

1434
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,669
He's bluffing you, Elliot.
Can't you see that?

1435
01:35:50,752 --> 01:35:52,002
I want to hear you say...

1436
01:35:52,128 --> 01:35:53,671
"You are, without a doubt..."

1437
01:35:53,755 --> 01:35:55,130
- What's wrong?
- Shut up!

1438
01:35:55,214 --> 01:35:56,798
Say it! I want to hear you say it!

1439
01:35:56,882 --> 01:35:59,425
"You are, without a doubt,
the dumbest fucker...

1440
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:01,134
"...I've ever seen on this planet".

1441
01:36:01,219 --> 01:36:03,220
- Say it!
- Dumb fucker.

1442
01:36:04,721 --> 01:36:07,473
- Apparently, I'm not as dumb...
- He didn't do nothing!

1443
01:36:07,557 --> 01:36:10,309
I'm not as dumb
as you fucking think I am, am I?

1444
01:36:10,393 --> 01:36:12,602
What the fuck is waiting for us up there?

1445
01:36:12,686 --> 01:36:14,186
What the fuck's waiting for us?

1446
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:15,437
He's going to shoot him.

1447
01:36:15,563 --> 01:36:18,440
Tell me, or I'll pump two
in your face right here and now.

1448
01:36:18,524 --> 01:36:20,441
He's not going to shoot him.

1449
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:21,818
Motherfuck!

1450
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:23,193
He's going to shoot him.

1451
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:25,153
Like Nick Curry said, "If I'm wrong...

1452
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:27,322
"...I'll fucking apologize, all right?"

1453
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:28,823
Something's amiss, I feel it.

1454
01:36:28,907 --> 01:36:32,493
If anything strange goes down,
you'll be the first one shot.

1455
01:36:32,576 --> 01:36:34,619
He didn't do anything, what are you...

1456
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:36,997
Shut up! I'll blow this motherfucker away.

1457
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,163
Fuck you!

1458
01:36:39,207 --> 01:36:42,835
I wish somebody would come and get me
because I don't like this anymore!

1459
01:36:42,918 --> 01:36:44,961
Get a hold of yourself, you fucking sissy!

1460
01:36:45,044 --> 01:36:49,464
I really wish somebody would just come
and take me away! Just take me away!

1461
01:36:49,756 --> 01:36:51,841
Hang in there, Elliot, goddamn it!

1462
01:36:51,925 --> 01:36:54,760
I can't take this, I'm sorry, but I just can't!

1463
01:36:55,261 --> 01:36:57,554
I wish somebody would just come
to my rescue...

1464
01:36:57,637 --> 01:36:59,930
and everything will be all right.

1465
01:37:01,308 --> 01:37:04,226
- Elliot. Elliot.
- What?

1466
01:37:04,602 --> 01:37:06,144
I'm sorry, all right?

1467
01:37:07,478 --> 01:37:10,272
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Friends?

1468
01:37:12,608 --> 01:37:14,483
What the fuck is with this guy?

1469
01:37:14,568 --> 01:37:15,818
Quit playing around.

1470
01:37:15,901 --> 01:37:18,236
I wasn't playing around,
I just had to be sure.

1471
01:37:18,321 --> 01:37:20,614
That's all, that's all. I'm sure now, okay?

1472
01:37:20,697 --> 01:37:23,365
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to scare you.

1473
01:37:24,491 --> 01:37:28,244
Oh, man, I like this Clarence kid,
this fucking guy is crazy.

1474
01:37:39,837 --> 01:37:40,837
Yeah.

1475
01:37:51,095 --> 01:37:52,471
Oh, man.

1476
01:37:56,308 --> 01:37:57,850
Are you Dick Richie?

1477
01:37:58,435 --> 01:37:59,435
No.

1478
01:38:02,313 --> 01:38:04,231
Do you know a Clarence Worley?

1479
01:38:04,314 --> 01:38:05,314
Yes.

1480
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:08,859
- Do you know where we can find him?
- Yes, I do.

1481
01:38:12,154 --> 01:38:13,321
Well, where?

1482
01:38:14,155 --> 01:38:16,490
At the Beverly Ambassador.

1483
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:18,408
Where's that?

1484
01:38:18,533 --> 01:38:19,909
Well....

1485
01:38:20,994 --> 01:38:22,078
You go....

1486
01:38:22,828 --> 01:38:25,830
- No.
- Yeah, go down...

1487
01:38:25,915 --> 01:38:28,250
You guys want to smoke a bowl, or....

1488
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:31,335
Oh. Go down Beachwood...

1489
01:38:31,794 --> 01:38:35,880
and drive awhile,
and then you gotta turn right, okay?

1490
01:38:37,007 --> 01:38:40,385
And then you go, and you keep driving
and you keep driving.

1491
01:38:47,558 --> 01:38:48,808
Hello, Elliot.

1492
01:38:48,891 --> 01:38:49,891
Monty.

1493
01:38:50,226 --> 01:38:51,643
Are these your friends?

1494
01:38:51,727 --> 01:38:55,021
Yeah, yeah, you could say that.

1495
01:38:55,522 --> 01:38:56,605
Everybody, this is Monty.

1496
01:38:56,731 --> 01:39:00,192
Hi. Come on in. Lee's in the can,
he'll be out in a quick.

1497
01:39:04,529 --> 01:39:06,989
Holy shit, look at this.
Do you believe this?

1498
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:08,531
It's a helicopter.

1499
01:39:08,657 --> 01:39:10,575
Sorry, it's nothing personal.

1500
01:39:11,617 --> 01:39:12,701
Clarence.

1501
01:39:15,329 --> 01:39:17,497
There'll be no need
to search me, daredevil.

1502
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:19,665
All you'll find is this right here.

1503
01:39:19,749 --> 01:39:22,084
Now what compelled you
to bring that along?

1504
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:24,335
The same thing that compelled you guys...

1505
01:39:24,419 --> 01:39:26,795
to bring heavy artillery
to a business meeting.

1506
01:39:26,921 --> 01:39:28,255
I'll take that.

1507
01:39:28,673 --> 01:39:30,674
Well, you're going to have to.

1508
01:39:31,091 --> 01:39:32,508
Oh. Hi.

1509
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:34,926
Everybody's here.

1510
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,970
Elliot. Who's who?

1511
01:39:39,347 --> 01:39:42,266
That's Dick on the end there.

1512
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,933
Oh, that's Dick.

1513
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:45,852
Elliot tells me you're quite gifted.

1514
01:39:45,936 --> 01:39:48,271
And, yeah, Alabama in the middle.

1515
01:39:48,605 --> 01:39:49,605
Hello.

1516
01:39:49,898 --> 01:39:50,981
Clarence on the end.

1517
01:39:51,106 --> 01:39:52,273
Lee, this guy is....

1518
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:54,358
Boris, please. I'm meeting people now.

1519
01:39:54,443 --> 01:39:55,610
Mr. Donowitz?

1520
01:39:55,693 --> 01:39:58,236
Come on.
Don't insult me, just call me "Lee".

1521
01:39:58,362 --> 01:40:00,363
- Lee.
- Boris, shut the fuck up!

1522
01:40:00,447 --> 01:40:02,823
Come on, everybody, don't be shy.
Come on in.

1523
01:40:02,908 --> 01:40:04,783
Okay, Lee?

1524
01:40:05,075 --> 01:40:06,451
- Lee.
- Lee.

1525
01:40:06,702 --> 01:40:08,119
That's right, Lee.

1526
01:40:08,287 --> 01:40:10,455
I just gotta tell you, I really am a big fan.

1527
01:40:10,538 --> 01:40:13,207
Coming Home In a Body Bag
is my favorite movie.

1528
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:16,793
After Apocalypse Now, I think
it's the best Vietnam movie ever made.

1529
01:40:16,877 --> 01:40:18,544
Wow. Thank you very much, Clarence.

1530
01:40:18,628 --> 01:40:19,878
- Lee.
- What?

1531
01:40:20,463 --> 01:40:21,963
This guy is packing.

1532
01:40:23,215 --> 01:40:24,215
Really.

1533
01:40:24,466 --> 01:40:27,509
Well, I mean, I've been pretty
scared about this whole thing.

1534
01:40:27,593 --> 01:40:30,345
I'm fairly confident you're here
to do business, so look.

1535
01:40:30,429 --> 01:40:32,180
I don't want to be a wise guy.

1536
01:40:32,263 --> 01:40:35,641
If you want, I'll lay my gun on the table.
It's up to you.

1537
01:40:38,936 --> 01:40:41,062
No, I don't think that's necessary.

1538
01:40:41,145 --> 01:40:44,064
Boris, be nice.
Make everybody some coffee. Okay?

1539
01:40:44,731 --> 01:40:47,107
- A pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1540
01:40:47,234 --> 01:40:49,235
Honey, sit down. Relax, relax.

1541
01:40:49,985 --> 01:40:51,736
Elliot, you look like shit.

1542
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,987
Oh, I'm sorry.

1543
01:40:53,072 --> 01:40:55,073
I mean, it's completely disgusting.

1544
01:40:55,156 --> 01:40:58,200
If I could get a quick signature,
it would be great.

1545
01:40:58,659 --> 01:41:00,284
Whatever Bonnie wants.

1546
01:41:02,995 --> 01:41:04,913
Like my dailies, there, Clar?

1547
01:41:05,456 --> 01:41:06,706
Is that what these are?

1548
01:41:06,832 --> 01:41:08,416
- You like them?
- They're great.

1549
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,501
They better be, they cost me enough.

1550
01:41:10,585 --> 01:41:11,835
What did that day cost me?

1551
01:41:11,961 --> 01:41:13,586
$357,000.

1552
01:41:14,755 --> 01:41:17,590
Elliot, I swear to God,
somebody is stealing from me.

1553
01:41:17,674 --> 01:41:19,716
What's this one called, anyway?

1554
01:41:19,968 --> 01:41:21,969
It's a sequel to Body Bag.

1555
01:41:22,553 --> 01:41:23,386
Really?

1556
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:26,138
We don't have a title yet,
but what does Joe like?

1557
01:41:26,222 --> 01:41:28,348
Body Bags Two.

1558
01:41:28,933 --> 01:41:30,934
Oh. That's imaginative.

1559
01:41:31,268 --> 01:41:33,310
I've got more taste in my penis.

1560
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:36,729
This guy is really fucking funny.

1561
01:41:36,814 --> 01:41:40,149
Most of these movies that win a lot
of Oscars, I can't stand them.

1562
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:43,068
They're safe, geriatric,
coffee-table dog shit, you know?

1563
01:41:43,151 --> 01:41:45,361
We park our cars in the same garage.

1564
01:41:46,405 --> 01:41:47,071
It's all right.

1565
01:41:47,154 --> 01:41:50,323
All they make are unwatchable
movies from unreadable books.

1566
01:41:50,408 --> 01:41:51,741
Mad Max, that's a movie.

1567
01:41:51,825 --> 01:41:54,076
The Good The Bad And The Ugly...

1568
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,703
Rio Bravo, those are movies.

1569
01:41:55,787 --> 01:41:58,163
And Coming Home in a Body Bag,
that was a movie.

1570
01:41:58,289 --> 01:42:01,040
It was the only movie that won
Oscars with balls...

1571
01:42:01,124 --> 01:42:03,041
I mean, since Deerhunter.

1572
01:42:03,585 --> 01:42:05,085
I don't believe you.

1573
01:42:06,503 --> 01:42:09,547
What, do you like a little coffee
with your sugar, or what?

1574
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:12,966
Lee, I'm not satisfied until
the spoon stands straight up.

1575
01:42:14,342 --> 01:42:16,135
Give me a coffee, will you?

1576
01:42:17,262 --> 01:42:19,805
My uncle Roger and my uncle Jerry,
who were in Nam...

1577
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:21,389
saw Coming Home in a Body Bag.

1578
01:42:21,473 --> 01:42:24,017
They said that's
the most accurate Vietnam film...

1579
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,726
they had ever seen.

1580
01:42:25,894 --> 01:42:29,521
I'll tell you. When veterans
in that war say that about my project...

1581
01:42:29,605 --> 01:42:32,732
it makes the whole thing worthwhile.
Here's to you.

1582
01:42:33,316 --> 01:42:35,442
My friend, oops, I just met you.

1583
01:42:35,526 --> 01:42:38,737
You know why?
I think because we got the same interests.

1584
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:41,363
And you know what I'd like
to do right now?

1585
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,364
I'd like to see Dr. Zhivago.

1586
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:45,825
Where is it?

1587
01:42:46,242 --> 01:42:48,535
Is there a fucking doctor
in the house, or what?

1588
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:49,786
Hang on a second.

1589
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:52,038
When you see this, you are going to shit.

1590
01:42:52,122 --> 01:42:53,122
I better.

1591
01:42:57,585 --> 01:42:59,753
- What's the guy's name?
- Donowitz.

1592
01:43:14,974 --> 01:43:17,726
Lee, that's all practically uncut.
If you so desire...

1593
01:43:17,809 --> 01:43:19,268
you can cut that a lot more.

1594
01:43:19,353 --> 01:43:20,728
Don't worry, I'll desire.

1595
01:43:20,811 --> 01:43:22,604
Get me another cup of coffee, will you?

1596
01:43:22,688 --> 01:43:23,939
Me, too, Boris.

1597
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:27,526
I have to hand it to you, Clarence,
this is not nose garbage.

1598
01:43:27,609 --> 01:43:29,193
This is quality stuff.

1599
01:43:29,735 --> 01:43:32,403
Perfect merchandise. The only trouble is...

1600
01:43:32,821 --> 01:43:35,532
when I'm offered a deal
that's too good to be true...

1601
01:43:35,615 --> 01:43:37,407
it's because it's a lie.

1602
01:43:46,374 --> 01:43:48,250
Convince me you're on the level.

1603
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:49,291
Convince him.

1604
01:43:49,376 --> 01:43:51,752
If he don't bite, we have nothing
but possession.

1605
01:43:51,877 --> 01:43:54,921
We got lots of sandwich shit back there,
make something.

1606
01:43:55,005 --> 01:43:57,465
We got pastrami, nice rye....
Anybody want anything?

1607
01:43:57,549 --> 01:43:58,882
You, got any aspirin?

1608
01:43:58,967 --> 01:44:00,759
Yeah, sure. Get him that.

1609
01:44:01,885 --> 01:44:04,512
Well, Lee, it's like this.

1610
01:44:05,555 --> 01:44:08,932
You're getting this bargain because
I don't know what I'm doing.

1611
01:44:09,016 --> 01:44:13,436
You're used to dealing with professionals
which I'm not. I'm a rank amateur.

1612
01:44:13,728 --> 01:44:16,272
What the fuck is going on?
What's going on, Joe?

1613
01:44:16,397 --> 01:44:18,940
I can take that, sell it a little at a time...

1614
01:44:19,065 --> 01:44:21,441
and make a hell of a lot more money.

1615
01:44:21,776 --> 01:44:22,943
What's going on, Joe?

1616
01:44:23,068 --> 01:44:24,152
Elliot's too far away.

1617
01:44:24,236 --> 01:44:27,405
Look, this is the whole ball game,
this is the fucking ball game!

1618
01:44:27,488 --> 01:44:31,491
I'm not saying that you're a drug dealer,
but you're a fucking movie producer.

1619
01:44:31,576 --> 01:44:34,786
And you got access to all kinds
of money and shit like that.

1620
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:37,246
Shit. Oh, Joe...

1621
01:44:37,454 --> 01:44:39,831
- you are fucking killing me.
- Wait, wait.

1622
01:44:39,957 --> 01:44:40,957
There, wait, quiet.

1623
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,500
Now, I can't get a million for it,
but you can.

1624
01:44:43,626 --> 01:44:47,379
So I'll sell it to you for $200,000.
You go make a million with it.

1625
01:44:48,505 --> 01:44:51,424
Shit, it's all found money to me anyway,
you know?

1626
01:44:52,258 --> 01:44:53,425
There he is.

1627
01:44:55,969 --> 01:44:58,888
Me and my wife,
we're minimum-wage kids, you know?

1628
01:44:59,054 --> 01:45:00,847
$200,000. It means the world to us.

1629
01:45:02,892 --> 01:45:05,977
Elliot tells me that you're fronting
for a dirty cop.

1630
01:45:08,145 --> 01:45:10,354
Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anything.

1631
01:45:10,439 --> 01:45:12,398
He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop.

1632
01:45:12,482 --> 01:45:15,108
He saw his chance and he took it,
that's all.

1633
01:45:15,193 --> 01:45:16,776
Why does he trust you?

1634
01:45:17,819 --> 01:45:20,196
Well, we grew up together, that's why.

1635
01:45:21,947 --> 01:45:25,783
If you don't know shit, then why
does he think that you can sell it?

1636
01:45:28,036 --> 01:45:29,453
I bullshitted him.

1637
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:35,957
You're nuts!

1638
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:38,585
He's a wild man, this kid, Clarence.
I like him.

1639
01:45:38,711 --> 01:45:40,837
- You're wild, I love it.
- Hey, Lee.

1640
01:45:41,004 --> 01:45:44,757
I love this guy, he bullshitted him,
you believe this kid? I love him.

1641
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,217
Elliot, I love this kid.
Monty, get the money.

1642
01:45:47,343 --> 01:45:50,386
That's it, fellas,
let's get these son of a bitches.

1643
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:54,764
Now wait, wait.
I completely forgot, excuse me.

1644
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:57,558
- What's your part in this again?
- I'm his wife.

1645
01:45:57,642 --> 01:45:59,476
Oh, you're the wife, right.

1646
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,811
Clarence, Clarence.

1647
01:46:00,895 --> 01:46:02,270
What, did you beat her?

1648
01:46:02,354 --> 01:46:04,730
No, she got that playing basketball.

1649
01:46:06,816 --> 01:46:08,608
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry.

1650
01:46:08,692 --> 01:46:10,068
Why are you here?

1651
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:11,777
I'm an actor.

1652
01:46:11,986 --> 01:46:16,323
Dick, if you were just a fucking actor,
you would never have got in the room.

1653
01:46:16,615 --> 01:46:18,324
I'm friends with Elliot.

1654
01:46:18,659 --> 01:46:20,868
He's your friend? You got problems.

1655
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,035
All right.

1656
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,912
It's all right. Elliot knows me.

1657
01:46:23,995 --> 01:46:25,704
Elliot, here.

1658
01:46:25,956 --> 01:46:28,999
Call Joe and tell him
that the production manager reports...

1659
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:30,959
he's taking 30 cents of every dollar...

1660
01:46:31,043 --> 01:46:33,253
and putting it in his pocket.

1661
01:46:34,462 --> 01:46:36,505
Don't you want to count your money?

1662
01:46:36,589 --> 01:46:39,216
No, she can count it.
I'm going to the bathroom.

1663
01:46:39,299 --> 01:46:40,550
Give it to her.

1664
01:46:53,102 --> 01:46:54,811
I gotta hand it to you, Clarence.

1665
01:46:54,894 --> 01:46:57,563
- I was cool?
- Man, you were cooler than cool.

1666
01:46:58,398 --> 01:47:00,190
Oh, my God, I forgot my fucking vest.

1667
01:47:00,274 --> 01:47:00,982
Stupid.

1668
01:47:01,066 --> 01:47:02,316
Cody, on three.

1669
01:47:02,484 --> 01:47:04,944
One. Two. Three!

1670
01:47:08,405 --> 01:47:09,864
Put your guns down!

1671
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:12,575
Get down on the floor!

1672
01:47:13,325 --> 01:47:14,576
Drop your gun!

1673
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,578
Drop your guns and back away!

1674
01:47:17,745 --> 01:47:20,205
Both of you put the fucking guns
on the floor now!

1675
01:47:20,331 --> 01:47:21,331
Fuck you!

1676
01:47:21,415 --> 01:47:23,416
All you pigs! Put your guns on the floor!

1677
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,585
Monty! Are you, nuts?
Do what they say!

1678
01:47:25,669 --> 01:47:26,836
This is your last chance!

1679
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,713
Fuck you, this is your last chance!

1680
01:47:28,797 --> 01:47:29,380
Boris.

1681
01:47:29,465 --> 01:47:31,215
We could kill you all and you know it.

1682
01:47:31,299 --> 01:47:33,008
Get down on the fucking floor!

1683
01:47:33,092 --> 01:47:37,012
Boris, shut the fuck up!
We're all going to die here, these are cops.

1684
01:47:37,262 --> 01:47:39,054
So, they're cops. Who gives a shit!

1685
01:47:39,139 --> 01:47:42,683
Hey, Lee, something I never told you.
I hate fucking cops!

1686
01:47:42,766 --> 01:47:44,559
All right, let's be nice guys, come on.

1687
01:47:44,642 --> 01:47:47,102
Let's be nice.
We don't want anyone to die.

1688
01:47:47,228 --> 01:47:48,937
You look like a blond Frankenstein.

1689
01:47:49,021 --> 01:47:50,813
Put your gun down,
you son of a bitch!

1690
01:47:52,774 --> 01:47:53,774
211?

1691
01:47:53,941 --> 01:47:55,025
Yeah, 211.

1692
01:47:57,152 --> 01:47:58,694
Here you go, Mad Dog.

1693
01:48:08,495 --> 01:48:09,578
Holy shit!

1694
01:48:10,121 --> 01:48:11,288
Motherfucker!

1695
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:12,997
Who are these guys?

1696
01:48:13,123 --> 01:48:15,583
Put your fucking guns down!
Put'em down!

1697
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:18,084
Put'em down motherfucker!

1698
01:48:18,169 --> 01:48:19,252
Fuck you!

1699
01:48:21,129 --> 01:48:22,922
Put the fucking guns down.

1700
01:48:23,465 --> 01:48:25,800
How do you really think
I'm doing with Lee?

1701
01:48:25,883 --> 01:48:28,009
Are you kidding man, he loves you.

1702
01:48:28,135 --> 01:48:30,220
You don't think I'm kissing his ass, do you?

1703
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:32,221
You're saying what he wants to hear.

1704
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:34,932
That ain't the same as kissing his ass.

1705
01:48:35,224 --> 01:48:38,476
I saw Coming Home in a Body Bag,
I loved it, I'm not lying to him.

1706
01:48:38,559 --> 01:48:41,019
No, that's why it's not ass-kissing.

1707
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:43,396
What you're doing is genuine.

1708
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:44,855
And he knows it.

1709
01:48:48,526 --> 01:48:50,068
I like you, Clarence.

1710
01:48:50,486 --> 01:48:51,653
Always have.

1711
01:48:52,821 --> 01:48:54,154
Always will.

1712
01:48:59,076 --> 01:49:00,493
Put them down now!

1713
01:49:02,495 --> 01:49:03,745
Put'em down!

1714
01:49:03,995 --> 01:49:06,163
Put those guns down, motherfuckers!

1715
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:10,334
Officer Dimes. Officer Dimes.

1716
01:49:11,001 --> 01:49:13,461
Put'em down, motherfucker!
Put'em down!

1717
01:49:14,337 --> 01:49:15,170
Officer Dimes!

1718
01:49:15,255 --> 01:49:16,088
What?

1719
01:49:16,172 --> 01:49:17,423
Officer Dimes!

1720
01:49:19,425 --> 01:49:20,508
What?

1721
01:49:21,093 --> 01:49:23,761
This has nothing to do
with me anymore, right?

1722
01:49:23,845 --> 01:49:24,719
Okay.

1723
01:49:24,804 --> 01:49:26,721
So, I'm just going to leave.

1724
01:49:26,847 --> 01:49:28,973
And you guys just settle this
by yourselves.

1725
01:49:29,057 --> 01:49:31,684
Just shut up and stay the fuck put, Elliot!

1726
01:49:31,851 --> 01:49:33,560
How do you know his name?

1727
01:49:33,853 --> 01:49:36,020
Why the fuck did he know your name?

1728
01:49:36,521 --> 01:49:39,273
You little piece of shit!

1729
01:49:39,731 --> 01:49:42,024
You can forget about acting
for the next 20 years!

1730
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:43,526
Your fucking career is over!

1731
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,987
Take your fuckin' SAG card and burn it!

1732
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:48,488
You little cocksucker!

1733
01:49:48,905 --> 01:49:52,491
I treated you like a son!
You fucking stabbed me in the heart!

1734
01:49:52,868 --> 01:49:55,327
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

1735
01:49:55,578 --> 01:49:58,204
Motherfucker, don't touch him!
Motherfucker!

1736
01:49:58,872 --> 01:49:59,955
Fuck you!

1737
01:50:05,169 --> 01:50:06,169
Cody!

1738
01:50:32,565 --> 01:50:34,608
Clarence!

1739
01:51:13,971 --> 01:51:14,971
Sweetie!

1740
01:51:16,015 --> 01:51:17,015
Sweetie!

1741
01:51:20,435 --> 01:51:21,519
Baby!

1742
01:51:22,561 --> 01:51:25,647
Okay, you with the shotgun,
behind the couch! Come out!

1743
01:51:25,731 --> 01:51:27,482
Screw yourself in the ass!

1744
01:51:28,066 --> 01:51:29,441
The guy is a wop!

1745
01:51:30,652 --> 01:51:33,529
I said come out from behind the couch,
you ginny. Now!

1746
01:51:33,612 --> 01:51:34,862
Son of a whore!

1747
01:51:36,322 --> 01:51:39,616
I said to come out from behind the couch.
Okay? Capisce?

1748
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:41,283
Wait, wait....

1749
01:51:42,619 --> 01:51:43,869
Nice and slow!

1750
01:51:44,371 --> 01:51:45,621
Here I come.

1751
01:51:54,754 --> 01:51:56,880
Shit! The guy hit me.

1752
01:52:07,055 --> 01:52:08,848
Son of a bitch shot me!

1753
01:52:10,183 --> 01:52:11,350
Sweetie!

1754
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:15,812
Don't you die on me.

1755
01:52:20,691 --> 01:52:22,400
You're going to be okay.

1756
01:52:23,152 --> 01:52:24,652
I need an ambulance!

1757
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:27,571
I need an ambulance!

1758
01:52:40,623 --> 01:52:44,001
Fuck you! I'll blow this bitch's brains
to kingdom come!

1759
01:52:49,088 --> 01:52:50,589
I need an ambulance!

1760
01:52:50,673 --> 01:52:51,673
Shut up.

1761
01:52:53,341 --> 01:52:55,051
Fuck you, I'm bleeding!

1762
01:52:55,177 --> 01:52:56,886
I'll call you a hearse.

1763
01:52:59,096 --> 01:53:00,513
This is for Cody.

1764
01:53:03,349 --> 01:53:04,433
Fuck you!

1765
01:53:51,512 --> 01:53:53,429
Honey, you're alive!

1766
01:53:57,642 --> 01:53:58,809
I can't see.

1767
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:04,647
Honey, you have blood in your eye.
Come on.

1768
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:13,904
Fuck you! I want a car.
Take me to the airport!

1769
01:54:14,196 --> 01:54:15,530
And I want it full of gas!

1770
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,204
And a million bucks!
Small bills! And fast!

1771
01:54:32,627 --> 01:54:35,254
I am going to do this bitch, motherfuckers!

1772
01:55:18,454 --> 01:55:20,663
Amid the chaos of that day...

1773
01:55:20,748 --> 01:55:23,916
when all I could hear
was the thunder of gunshots...

1774
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,169
and all I could smell
was the violence in the air...

1775
01:55:27,419 --> 01:55:29,420
I look back and am amazed...

1776
01:55:29,796 --> 01:55:32,506
that my thoughts were so clear and true.

1777
01:55:32,882 --> 01:55:35,717
That three words went
through my mind endlessly.

1778
01:55:36,509 --> 01:55:39,470
Repeating themselves like a broken record.

1779
01:55:39,846 --> 01:55:41,096
You're so cool.

1780
01:55:42,264 --> 01:55:43,598
You're so cool.

1781
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:45,850
You're so cool.

1782
01:55:48,519 --> 01:55:52,439
And sometimes Clarence asks me
what would I have done if he had died.

1783
01:55:52,564 --> 01:55:55,608
If that bullet had been
two inches more to the left.

1784
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,109
To this, I always smile.

1785
01:55:58,486 --> 01:56:01,488
As if I'm not going to satisfy him
with a response.

1786
01:56:01,821 --> 01:56:03,739
But I always do.

1787
01:56:03,822 --> 01:56:06,199
I tell him of how I would want to die.

1788
01:56:06,533 --> 01:56:09,744
But that the anguish
and the want of death would fade...

1789
01:56:09,952 --> 01:56:11,912
like the stars at dawn.

1790
01:56:12,621 --> 01:56:15,456
And that things would be
much like they are now.

1791
01:56:15,957 --> 01:56:17,124
Perhaps.

1792
01:56:17,833 --> 01:56:20,585
Except maybe I wouldn't have
named our son...

1793
01:56:20,796 --> 01:56:22,713
Elvis.
