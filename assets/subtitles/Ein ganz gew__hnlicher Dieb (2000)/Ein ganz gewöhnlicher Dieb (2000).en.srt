1
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,643
Morning.

2
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:48,560
Lovely morning.
- Not bad

3
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,593
Banks never on time, are they?

4
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:54,591
No, no, they're desperate.
Desperate.

5
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,096
Desperate altogether.

6
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:59,033
Try another branch.

7
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:08,536
Morning.
Like to make a withdrawal, please.

8
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,252
Harrison will defend
the bail application,

9
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:27,218
maybe even take the trial.

10
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:31,223
But he insists on
two thousand pounds in cash.

11
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,558
For a morning's work?

12
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:34,758
Up front.
As in now, before we go in.

13
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:36,596
I see, he doesn't trust me.

14
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:39,896
Here he is now,
Michael, he's worth it.

15
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,646
Morning.
- Morning

16
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,812
It's nearly time.

17
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:48,278
Are we in funds?

18
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,104
Huh?

19
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:53,846
Oh, the cash.
Just been to the bank.

20
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:57,718
No... not here, Mr. Lynch.

21
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:01,816
And you will be taking that off
in court, won't you?

22
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:04,794
The prosecution's claim that
they fear my client

23
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:06,159
might leave this country
while on bail,

24
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:10,930
is completely and totally
without foundation.

25
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:14,063
Especially when Mr. Lynch's
lovely little daughter, Breda

26
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,574
is having her
first Holy Communion soon

27
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:19,611
and it would be tragic

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,706
if her father were not
to be with her on that day.

29
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,147
So, Your Honour,

30
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:30,179
the State can find no course
in law or in justice

31
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:34,694
why this clean-living unassuming --

32
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:37,593
teetotaler should have
his bail rescinded.

33
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,859
Mr. Lynch may remain on bail

34
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,764
until his trial commences
two weeks on Monday.

35
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,837
Mr. Lynch, how does it feel to be
the most wanted man in Ireland?

36
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,271
Do you think
you'll get a fair trial?

37
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:51,305
Mr. Lynch, you enjoy making
the Gardai look thick, don't you?

38
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:54,070
Hold... a minute, lads...

39
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:55,774
don't ever think the Gardas
are thick, you'd be wrong.

40
00:03:55,848 --> 00:04:00,253
It'd be a big mistake.
The Gardas are anything but thick.

41
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,080
In fact, I think the Gardas are
very, very clever.

42
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,317
Is your name Michael Patrick Lynch?

43
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:05,617
You see, right there,
an example of brains. You see?

44
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,058
Excuse me, I am Mr. Lynch's attorney
and I object very much...

45
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,653
I'm detaining you on suspicion of
possessing illegal substances,

46
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:12,097
under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,566
I know what you want to do.

48
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,762
You want to strip search me,
don't you?

49
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:18,064
Please, let go of him.
This man is my client.

50
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,968
Oh, I see, you think
you'll humble me, do you?

51
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:22,567
Oh, no...! Look at them!
Look at what I have to put up with!

52
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,908
Look at what they do
to innocent people.

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,880
Trying to grab a feel.
Trying to grab me balls, you queer.

54
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:30,545
You dirty perverts,
trying to get your rocks off.

55
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,052
Drugs? What drugs?

56
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:34,519
I've never done drugs in me life
and everyone knows it.

57
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,284
Show them your credentials, Mike.

58
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,514
Find the drugs.

59
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,856
Give us a look, get them off.

60
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:45,066
Find the drugs. Come on,
put your fucking hand up my hole,

61
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:45,930
you poofters.

62
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,228
Come on.

63
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:49,665
Show 'em your credentials, Michael.

64
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,206
Hey, you fucking faggots.
What are you afraid of?

65
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:55,038
You do it in private,
but not here, you fuckers.

66
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:01,750
Do you want any more, love?

67
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:04,786
I'm grand unless there's dessert?

68
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:05,946
Of course there is.

69
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:08,956
Is that you in the newspaper da?

70
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:12,949
Oh, can I finish that?

71
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,858
Yeah, waste not, want not. Thanks.

72
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,764
Oh, God, Michael, give it to me.
Give it to me.

73
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:21,064
You know the way
all that red meat makes him hyper.

74
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,637
Sorry, sorry wasn't thinking.

75
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:24,228
Your father first.
Who earns the money in this house?

76
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:25,598
Da does.

77
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:26,935
They're all grand.
There's enough for everyone.

78
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,704
They have to learn.

79
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:30,608
you just better go to bed
when you're told tonight.

80
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:31,940
Okay, mum.

81
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,545
Have you got Lynch with you, lads?

82
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:38,985
Check. We have him in our sights.

83
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,646
Clothes on or off today?

84
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:41,985
Fuck off.

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,682
She's great.

86
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:50,625
Say hello to your da.
Go on. Found him.

87
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:51,665
Is that them, huh?

88
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,860
Is that the two sisters?

89
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:54,629
Oh, that's them all right, boy.

90
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:57,672
Bet he was glad he didn't have to
choose between them, huh?

91
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:01,076
Why choose
when you can have both, boy?

92
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:02,838
Mind your mothers now.
Do what they tell you.

93
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,242
See you tonight.

94
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:05,812
See you.

95
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,285
I'll call round later,
collect the kids, yeah?

96
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,177
Hey, Tommy, get off the bleeding
bike, come on.

97
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,050
Oh, come on, can I stay on?

98
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,920
You know I can't take you
without a helmet.

99
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,492
Please Auntie Lisa...
Come on, just one go.

100
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:18,687
Come on then,
say goodbye to your da.

101
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,127
Bye, da.

102
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:22,495
Wave him goodbye.

103
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,000
Look at daddy
going round and round.

104
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,939
Say goodbye.

105
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,480
Jesus, there's no way he can
shake us off, not out here anyway.

106
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:41,574
So what's the point?

107
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,225
Jesus. We're running very low
on petrol, Barry.

108
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,528
Control where's
the nearest service station?

109
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:02,163
Con's very worried about
the petrol situation.

110
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:03,172
He's getting out.

111
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:04,605
Okay, lads,
I'll be right back to you.

112
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,300
We're off.

113
00:07:09,915 --> 00:07:12,314
Right, lads,
the nearest petrol station's

114
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,812
a good ten miles away, maybe more.

115
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:14,817
Oh, Jesus.

116
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:17,149
North east of the Bray Road.
Turn left for Bray.

117
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:20,122
There's an Esso on the left,
about three miles outside the town.

118
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,214
Keep in touch.

119
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,221
I don't believe this.

120
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:27,761
Ah for fuck, I told you
stop for petrol, didn't I?

121
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,494
But, no, you said,
''We're fine, Con''.

122
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:33,536
Look at him.
Sure, give him a wave, you wander.

123
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,267
Where would you be
without the social welfare, huh?

124
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,838
I couldn't agree more, Michael.
A vital few bob.

125
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:11,273
Tony Brady.

126
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:13,910
It's the difference between eating
and not eating sometimes.

127
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,778
You said it, Tony. Good luck.

128
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:19,576
Later.

129
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,487
Michael Lynch.
And how are you today?

130
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:23,077
Fine thanks.

131
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:31,254
There you go.

132
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:32,759
You're a gentleman
do you know that?

133
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:33,890
Thank you.

134
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,525
It's fellas like you
make the world go around.

135
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,073
Right, we've caught up with Lynch.

136
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:47,543
Told you he wouldn't miss out
on collecting his precious dole.

137
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,006
Well, don't lose him this time.

138
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:51,084
Oh, don't worry,
we're up his hole, Control.

139
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:52,616
And we've a full tank

140
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,812
Mr. Lynch won't be getting away
from us again today.

141
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,889
Right, lads, keep in touch.

142
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,820
I'll say one thing for him,
he sticks to the speed limit.

143
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:21,073
Don't fuck about.

144
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,047
Yeah, no problem, Michael.

145
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,116
You're a mess, little brother.

146
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,798
Relax, we're just passing through!

147
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:40,960
Fucking hell!

148
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:42,024
Excuse me, ladies...

149
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:44,537
say hello to my little friend.

150
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:12,225
Ho... here we go. He's off.
Put your foot down there, Con.

151
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,662
Something happening, Control.

152
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,703
You're telling me. There's a report
of a robbery at the dole office.

153
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,706
Oh, for fuck's sake, we're just
at the fucking dole office.

154
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:20,298
What?

155
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,509
Fuck it! What do we do now?

156
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:29,981
I never promised you a story.

157
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:30,778
You did!

158
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:31,649
I did not.

159
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:32,778
You did so, da!

160
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:34,049
What did I tell you about lying?

161
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:36,625
To lie to everyone
except you and ma.

162
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,684
And us.

163
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,923
Oh, yeah, and Auntie Lisa.

164
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,090
And the whole family. You never
lie to anyone in the family.

165
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,731
Tell us the story
about The Mansions, da.

166
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:52,138
Yeah, da,
tell us about The Mansions.

167
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:55,067
Fair enough.

168
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,043
Do you want to hear
the whole thing?

169
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:57,009
From the start.

170
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,636
Okay.

171
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:02,044
Long, long ago,
years ago before you were born

172
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,745
and your ma and me and Auntie Lisa
were very young

173
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:07,186
we all lived in a place
called The Mansions.

174
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:09,817
All our grannies and grand-dads
and brothers

175
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:13,089
and sisters and all our pals.
It was brilliant.

176
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:15,926
It was like a big hotel...

177
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:18,727
built specially for us
and all our mates.

178
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:20,860
And when I was young,

179
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,030
I used to think
God was smiling down on us.

180
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,542
Putting a special glow around us
so we could do as we pleased.

181
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:31,206
Go about our business with
no-one getting in our way.

182
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:33,682
And that it would never change.

183
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,683
Tell us about the bailiffs, da.

184
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,019
All right, so.

185
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,625
Do you know what bailiffs are?

186
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:44,024
They're just like gods
but they're worse.

187
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:45,754
Much worse.

188
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,663
So... one day...
this was before you were born.

189
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,932
I was coming home
after working hard all day.

190
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:59,669
And I saw them -- the bailiffs
attacking our homes.

191
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:03,008
Big bastards with hammers and
knives and all sorts of things.

192
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,081
But that didn't stop me
when I saw what they were at.

193
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,649
I went for them.

194
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,081
We fought for hours.

195
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,214
But there was too many altogether.

196
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,254
So, your ma and me and Lisa

197
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:15,153
we barricaded ourselves in
and we wouldn't come out.

198
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,591
You're need gonna take our homes
away from us.

199
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:19,253
And they couldn't get in,
no matter how hard they tried.

200
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:22,726
They huffed and they puffed,
but it was no use.

201
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,801
And all around us...

202
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,836
we could hear
the screaming and wailing

203
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:29,668
of our friends and neighbors

204
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,731
as they tore their houses
to little pieces.

205
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,971
Like savages they were.

206
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,239
They tried everything

207
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,140
but they didn't know me.

208
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,945
I wouldn't budge.

209
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,282
No matter if they brought the
whole place down around our ears.

210
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,851
And then the Mayor came!

211
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,788
That's right.

212
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:49,587
They were so pissed off
they couldn't get the better of me

213
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:53,653
the Lord Mayor of Dublin himself
come out to see your da.

214
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:55,260
Mr. Lynch.

215
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:58,323
Michael!

216
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:03,904
Michael! Michael, please,
if you'll just hear me.

217
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,601
Michael...

218
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:09,746
Get on your knees!

219
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:10,941
I'm pleading with you!

220
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,778
I personally have been authorized

221
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:16,720
to offer you these keys
to two houses.

222
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:18,688
One for us and one for Auntie Lisa.

223
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,587
And I made him promise...

224
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:24,059
that no-one could ever take
our homes away from us again.

225
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:26,527
And the Mayor said...

226
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:31,195
Yes, I promise!

227
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:34,500
So, I graciously
accepted their offer.

228
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:37,999
I won. I beat them all.

229
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:41,046
The bailiff and the Mayor
and the law.

230
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,947
I was loyal.
And that's why I won.

231
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,745
You see, the thing is...

232
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,548
they'll never beat you...

233
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:53,523
if you stick together
and stay loyal.

234
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,032
Are they asleep?

235
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:14,610
It's time
for the tickle man.

236
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:20,975
See you tomorrow.

237
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:22,911
'Night.

238
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:43,707
Hiya, Michael.

239
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,176
Hey, Shaun.

240
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,113
You're late.

241
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:57,817
Sorry, bedtime stories.

242
00:14:57,924 --> 00:15:00,154
God! The Mansions again.

243
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,524
I bet that put 'em to sleep.

244
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,298
Christine asked me to ask you

245
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:17,669
would you mind looking
after Tom and Shane tomorrow.

246
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:20,246
She has to go into town to
get Breda her first communion gear.

247
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:21,981
No problem.

248
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,115
Are you ready for this?

249
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,745
Oh yeah.

250
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,761
I missed you.

251
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:52,505
Fuck them! Don't answer!

252
00:15:56,751 --> 00:16:00,083
No, gotta call Billy,
tell him what's happening.

253
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,721
Jesus! Fuck 'em!

254
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:08,994
Who was with you at the bank?

255
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,326
It was Stevie.

256
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:13,123
No, no. Did Stevie drive the car?

257
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:15,168
Stevie drove the car, right?

258
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:16,225
That's right.

259
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:17,995
And Tony Brady was with you, yeah?

260
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:19,971
You see,
we know what you did, Lynch,

261
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,134
doing jobs
while you're out on bail.

262
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,177
And we have proof boy.

263
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,251
All you have to do is say,
''Yes, that's just the way it was''.

264
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,081
You drove to the courts
on a motorbike

265
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,715
and then you switched
at the last moment, right?

266
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:41,661
Fifteen minutes,
that's easy on a bike, Lynch.

267
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:43,256
Give us an answer,
you fucking gobshite!

268
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:45,524
All right, Con. Take it easy.

269
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:48,568
Shall we start all over again,
shall we?

270
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:51,663
You weren't with either of
your two wives Monday night

271
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:53,034
we know that much.

272
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,736
So, Michael, if you weren't
with the two ugly sisters

273
00:16:56,845 --> 00:17:00,211
don't tell me you were off
banging some other old slag?

274
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,038
I realize you're not a golfing man,
Detective Sergeant

275
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:32,513
but...
the Association of Inspectors

276
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,813
and Superintendents Annual
Four Ball

277
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:35,909
had to be cancelled today.

278
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,989
Now, why do you think
it had to be cancelled?

279
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:40,853
Well, I did mention to you, sir,

280
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:42,825
that things like this usually
happen when we try to inter...

281
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,917
Don't be the smart Alec with me,
Noel.

282
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,258
I haev to tell you,

283
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,761
there's a lot of very unhappy
golfers here today.

284
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:51,961
This is vital rest and recreation
for senior officers.

285
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:54,765
Do you understand the importance
of this, Detective Sergeant?

286
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:55,964
Well I do now, sir.

287
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,634
Are you trying to tell me
''I told you so''?

288
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,704
I'll tell you someting,
Detective Sergeant...

289
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:04,680
I will not have
the reputation of the Garda...

290
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:08,775
brought into disrepute
by these shenanigans.

291
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:12,583
We will not be intimidated
by the likes of Michael Lynch.

292
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,590
Are you listening to me now?

293
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:16,887
Christine wasn't upset, was she?

294
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,623
No, no, she's fine.

295
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:21,586
You see, every time
you go out on the road

296
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,790
there's dangers out there

297
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,928
bits of glass lying in wait nails,
pot-holes.

298
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,800
So you have to watch out,
watch your every move

299
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:32,207
coos otherwise they'll get you.

300
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:33,843
Who?

301
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,106
The bits of glass and that.

302
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:39,012
Sooner or later,
if you're not careful

303
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,848
and then you get a puncture
and then you're fucked.

304
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,582
And then you fix it for me.

305
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:47,284
Yeah, I do.
Aren't you a clever little shite.

306
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,585
Can I put the patch on now?

307
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,153
Don't wrinkle it.

308
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,128
Job's worth doing.

309
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,897
If a job's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.

310
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,506
That's right... cool.

311
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:12,979
That'll be the best way to park.

312
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:14,983
Fucking brilliant parking that was.

313
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,851
Shit!
A beaut.

314
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,517
Hey, Tony, you drive like
a bleeding old woman.

315
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,559
Fucking comedian...

316
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,535
Mad fuck.

317
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,009
Michael...

318
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,512
...the new fella, Shay Kirby...

319
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,248
doesn't bother you
he used to be in the IRA?

320
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,183
Nah, he's out a couple of years.

321
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,055
A bit doggy though, isn't it?

322
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,217
Look, why are you bringing him in?

323
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:57,688
He's the inside man on the job
I'm gonna tell you about.

324
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,627
Look, I understand.

325
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,961
While I'm talking I'll make
some crack about the Provos,

326
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,159
you watch how he reacts.

327
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,030
Tommy, come on, we're going.

328
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:06,068
Say goodbye to daddy.

329
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:06,967
Bue-bye, da.

330
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,005
By, chicken.

331
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,131
Bye lads.

332
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,709
Bye.

333
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,073
Bye, da.

334
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,008
All right, sitting down, lads.

335
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,680
One more round, Michael?

336
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,115
Little fella, sit down.

337
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,616
All right...

338
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:23,513
First, you've all met Shay Kirby.

339
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,781
How's it going?

340
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,615
Now, as you know...

341
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:31,824
I may be a bit occupied in the
Four Courts come Monday week.

342
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,990
Now, should go okay,
but you never know.

343
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:35,896
So I thought maybe now is the time

344
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,230
for a job I've been thinking about
the last few months.

345
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,770
One of those impossible ones.

346
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,635
Now, this is one the IRA
had their piggy little eyes on

347
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,869
but even they thought
it couldn't be done.

348
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,810
Well, lads, when I heard that
I thought to myself,

349
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,246
we're gonna have to show
those dozy fuckers a thing or two

350
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:54,048
about robbing
O'Donnell's jewellery factory.

351
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,086
Jesus Christ, Michael.

352
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,815
Bollocks, man!

353
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,788
What I was thinking was...

354
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:03,057
we wouldn't actually try to
break into the factory itself

355
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:07,726
but we'd sort of drop in.

356
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,837
Fuck. Jesus Christ!

357
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,920
And then sort of camp
out in the yard

358
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:37,157
until someone arrives to let us
in the next morning.

359
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,563
And that someone...

360
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,726
is Mr. Fintan Doorley
the General Manager.

361
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:44,031
Like myself, very precise man.

362
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:47,699
Fintan arrives
at five-to-eight every morning.

363
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,836
Now, as a man
who likes and needs routine

364
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:54,040
he will probably be
a bit surprised at what he sees.

365
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:04,989
Good morning, Mr. Doorley.
We're here to steal your gold.

366
00:22:05,094 --> 00:22:06,560
Meet our esteemed leader.

367
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:07,856
Good morning, staff.

368
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:10,157
Identify yourselves.

369
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,670
Once inside
they'll meet Tony, Tom and Billy

370
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:19,069
who'll invite them
to step into the marquee.

371
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:21,665
And lads... Politely, okay?

372
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:23,143
As long as
they're doing us no harm,

373
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:24,804
we won't do them any harm.

374
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,940
Stop mucking around.
Do as you're told!

375
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,676
You got that, Billy?

376
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,614
What?

377
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:30,777
Just get the people inside.

378
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:32,877
Blow up the air bed, love,
I'l be in in a minute.

379
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:33,955
That's enough out of you, Billy.

380
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:35,522
Give us a kiss,
you big ride, you.

381
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:37,920
Yeah, yeah. Okay, Michael.

382
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:52,335
So that at quarter-to-nine,
we all drive back out again.

383
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:54,041
And we can all relax

384
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:57,542
because it will be some time before
anyone gets to call the Gardai.

385
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:03,183
Now does everyone have a picture
of that in their minds?

386
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:08,055
Because, lads, I promise...

387
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:12,923
that's just the way
it's gonne be easy as pie.

388
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:17,861
What age are you, Alec?

389
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:20,162
What, ten years younger than me?

390
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:21,567
Big difference.

391
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,597
Then Tony and Michael,
add another ten years on to that.

392
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:26,999
Now, when they were kids
they had fuck all.

393
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:28,576
Ain't that right, Michael?

394
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:29,303
We had each other.

395
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:30,842
True.

396
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,572
Now, I'm that much younger
so I got some stuff,

397
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:36,548
but it was never the right stuff.

398
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:37,846
What are you
shitting on about, man?

399
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,785
Billy, Billy knows
what I'm talking about, don't you?

400
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:41,289
No.

401
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:42,957
For fuck's sake.

402
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,586
What was the big thing
when you were eight, say?

403
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:47,689
''Star Wars'', I suppose.
Is that what you mean?

404
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:48,823
''Star Wars''.

405
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:51,128
Now, I bet you got the proper
''Star Wars'' stuff.

406
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:53,795
You know, the real toys.
What were they called?

407
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:55,963
Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader,
I had all that shite, man.

408
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:58,008
And it was the proper thing, yeah?
The official stuff?

409
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:59,667
Yeah, so what?

410
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:01,074
So, I never got that.

411
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,777
But, sure, me da probably robbed
the fucking things anyway.

412
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:05,041
It doesn't matter!

413
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,017
My ma and da couldn't even rob
the proper thing.

414
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:11,544
That's a fucking tragedy, Stevie.

415
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,249
It is a fucking tragedy.

416
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:17,988
Fellas your age,
you got the proper thing.

417
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:21,087
And now my kids want
every fucking thing that's going.

418
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,597
And you're gonna use
all your money

419
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,066
to make sure they get it.
Fair play to you.

420
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:25,567
In me hole.

421
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:29,833
I'm gonna make up for all the stuff
I missed out on.

422
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:33,104
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

423
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,009
Go ahead Tom.

424
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:45,511
Right, Michael.

425
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,250
Now, the depth of this door
is just right.

426
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:53,962
Now, once that panel is removed
the bars sit in there,

427
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:56,092
nice and snug.

428
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,567
Now, if you have enough of them,
they don't rattle around.

429
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:03,174
And you don't even notice
the extra weight

430
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:05,606
when you're opening
and closing the door.

431
00:25:07,613 --> 00:25:10,775
Now this couple I've lined up
they're complete innocents

432
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:12,144
that's the beauty of it

433
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,047
no extra splits.

434
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:16,086
They're just
old friends of me da's.

435
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:19,487
Couple in their fifties
Mr. and Mrs. Harmless.

436
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:20,888
And you know Customs...

437
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,157
while they're busy searching
bearded ex-hippies in their 2CVs

438
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:28,132
they'll be tipping
their hats at our pair

439
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,724
as they chugger, chugger through

440
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:31,531
at their usual
twenty-five miles an hour.

441
00:25:31,637 --> 00:25:34,105
Then they drive all the way over
to the Cotswolds.

442
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:36,641
They've told me all about
this lovely hotel

443
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,701
it's so quiet and peaceful that
they always go back every year.

444
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:44,207
This is how I see it all happening,
Michael.

445
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:47,813
It's not too far from Birmingham,
right,

446
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,583
so I can fly in be at their hotel
inwhat, half an hour.

447
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:53,182
They'll be there taking afternoon tea
completely unaware

448
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,955
that they've a couple of
hundred thousand quids'

449
00:25:55,063 --> 00:25:57,223
worth of gold
sitting outside in the car.

450
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,073
There'll be no more than,
what a dozen cars parked there

451
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:08,768
no security, so getting
at the car'll be no problem.

452
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,902
Bing, bang, boom. Get the gold

453
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:11,943
bring it to the fence.

454
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:14,276
Tom, it all sounds fine.

455
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:16,574
I'll see you when you get back, so.

456
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:21,611
Don't worry about it, Michael.
You can trust me.

457
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:27,554
Hi, Uncle Billy.

458
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:32,031
Come here to me, chicken.
Come here to me.

459
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:35,558
Oh, look at you.

460
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,830
My God,
are you an angel or a princess?

461
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:38,836
Isn't she gorgeous?

462
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,965
Come here to me. Tell me this would
that buy a few rosary beads eh?

463
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:45,542
Come here.
What do you say to Mr. Higgins?

464
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,134
Thank you.

465
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:47,270
No problem, love.

466
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:48,606
Good girl, good girl.
Now, come here to me, listen.

467
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:49,547
Go on uupstairs, right,

468
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,638
and I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

469
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,580
All right, chicken, go on.

470
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:53,744
Save us a dance, love,
will you?

471
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,214
Who's your man there
with Billy?

472
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,724
Higgins is his name.

473
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:03,560
Grew up around here all right.
Went to college, you know.

474
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:05,622
IRA I heard.

475
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,260
Funny thing, he looks more like you
than your brother does.

476
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,736
Same haircut anyway.

477
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,101
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,699
I'm telling you.

479
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:17,607
Yeah, I know, I'm not gonna
fuck it up all right?

480
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:20,906
Thanks for the lift.

481
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,611
Da, da, look what granny gave me.

482
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,878
What is it, chicken?

483
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:28,513
It's a holy book
with lots of pictures.

484
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:30,250
Oh, isn't that brilliant?

485
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,288
What I'd give to
have a present like that.

486
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:36,025
That's what I'd like to know
where did you come from?

487
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,257
Guess.

488
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:42,266
Mickey, you know that job that
Tom was doing for you in England?

489
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,096
Yeah.

490
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:46,732
What I mean, Mike,
even though I always knew that

491
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:49,709
Tom was a bit of a fucking eject
you know, he was sound.

492
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,746
I mean, if you'd asked me
that's what I'd have told you.

493
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,517
Looks like
he's done a runner and...

494
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:00,749
there's no car and there's no gold.

495
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:02,618
Yeah.

496
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,057
So what do you wanna do?

497
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:08,185
Why the fuck did he think
he could get away with it?

498
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:09,821
It's not like him,
I'll say that for him.

499
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,928
And mind you, can you ever
trust anyone these days?

500
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:15,527
Yeah, you can.
That's what it's all about.

501
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:18,073
Wouldn't have asked him to
do the job if I didn't trust him.

502
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:21,766
What now?

503
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:23,709
You go find him. Bring him back.

504
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:25,473
Okay.

505
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:26,173
Tony...

506
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:27,077
Yeah?

507
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,242
You can finish your dinner first.

508
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,493
Jesus, are you gonna queue up?

509
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:45,728
I'll have to, won't I
unless you've any better ideas?

510
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:48,269
Well, I can get you in there
no bother. Private tour.

511
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:51,097
No, thanks,
I'll try the front door.

512
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:52,834
Fair enough.
Listen, I've gotta go.

513
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:55,240
Got this stupid fucking court thing
in half-an-hour.

514
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,300
Enjoy yourself.

515
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,513
I will.
You'll be all right, will you?

516
00:28:58,615 --> 00:28:59,913
Course.

517
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,682
My Lord, may I request
an adjournment of proceedings

518
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:10,724
until Wednesday?

519
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:12,659
Application refused.

520
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:14,094
but, my Lord, Mr. Harrison...

521
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:19,602
the prosecution is ready,
the jury is ready, I am ready.

522
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:24,198
Your client cannot avoid
the process of law indefinitely.

523
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:27,642
Mr. McHale, are you ready to begin?

524
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:29,109
Certainly, my Lord.

525
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:35,210
Almost two years ago
on the nineteenth of February

526
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:38,285
the defendant, Michael Lynch
and an unknown associate

527
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:41,650
entered the premises of Superex
a video game company.

528
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,817
They were armed and dangerous.

529
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:46,192
They threatened the life
of a member of staff

530
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:49,288
and stole over
thirty-two thousand pounds in cash.

531
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:52,666
Listen, Michael...

532
00:29:54,637 --> 00:29:56,105
See this?

533
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:58,573
Yeah?

534
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:00,701
Can I hang it up in our room?

535
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,642
What do you want
a holy picture for?

536
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:05,310
It's not a holy picture,
it's a Caravaggio.

537
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:06,878
He's about as holy as you are.

538
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:08,509
Well, it looks like
a holy picture to me.

539
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:10,144
Can I hang it up, or can't I?

540
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:11,277
Of course.

541
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:12,988
And you wont' be
slagging me about it?

542
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:14,523
I promise.

543
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:16,520
Grand.

544
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,759
Can I go to the toilet, da?

545
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:23,026
Of course.

546
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:27,038
Do you get the feeling
I don't believe you, Tom?

547
00:30:27,872 --> 00:30:32,205
Please, Michael... please!
I swear...

548
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:33,971
I mean, even if it is true,
these old ones

549
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:36,137
got their car door
ripped off by a passing Land Rover

550
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:38,342
and then left it abandoned
on the side of the road.

551
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:41,175
I searched, Michael.
I drove up and down.

552
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:44,551
I found the car and I even
put a new door on it an' all.

553
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:49,219
I fucked up, you know,
and I was, I was afraid.

554
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:52,093
So you don't think
I'm a fair man then, Tom?

555
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:53,832
No.

556
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:57,167
No, it's not, it's not that,
Michael, it's...

557
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:03,839
Please, Michael...
I'm sorry, please.

558
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:06,875
What did you do with the gold?

559
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,776
Oh, God...

560
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,141
I did nothing!

561
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,117
I never got it, I never!

562
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:18,623
It's gone. You have to believe me.

563
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:20,557
But you ran away, Tom.

564
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,585
Only scumbags run away.

565
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:25,686
You can't trust someone
who does that, can you?

566
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:27,321
I mean, would you trust them, Tom?
Would you?

567
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,795
No, no, I wouldn't.

568
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,650
So you see why this is a problem
I have to deal with, don't you?

569
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:46,083
I mean, I can't leave it
hanging around, can I?

570
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:47,210
Yeah, I know...

571
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,719
Where's the gold?

572
00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:50,255
I don't know.

573
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:56,361
What do you think?

574
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:59,121
I don't know, Michael, I...

575
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:04,768
I'm not certain...
or anything like...

576
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:06,202
I'd nearly believe him, Michael.

577
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,295
Yeah, I think you're right.

578
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:10,702
His story is so stupid
it's probably true.

579
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:12,804
All rigth, let him down.

580
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,247
I'm sorry, Tom.
I believe your story now.

581
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,919
Tony'll take you to the hospital.

582
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:23,816
Oh, you're on the medical card,
aren't you?

583
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,983
I mean this won't
cost you anything, will it?

584
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:26,821
No.

585
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:29,294
Grand, night. Lads.

586
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,759
And will the accused sit up

587
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:38,294
and let us see his face, please!

588
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,976
The accused is a very clever man.

589
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,876
But the extraordinary thing
about him

590
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,175
is that he seems unable to resist

591
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:51,808
letting the rest of the world
know how clever he is.

592
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,886
sometimes I think
he's not a real criminal at all,

593
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:56,548
he's just a big show-off.

594
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:10,193
How are things, Michael?

595
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:11,567
Fair, Shay.
What'll you have?

596
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:12,934
No, I'm grand.

597
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:17,166
Is everything all right,
Michael?

598
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:20,272
Yeah, fine.

599
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:26,315
Oh, it's just this...
there's this judge...

600
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:28,520
he's getting on my nerves.

601
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:32,151
He's prejudiced, you know.

602
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:33,021
Is that right?

603
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:40,031
That's his daughter's car.
Do you think you could find it?

604
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,729
Consider it done.

605
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,268
Trial's supposed to end
on Thursday

606
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,568
will that give you enough time
to send them a bit of a message?

607
00:33:52,012 --> 00:33:53,072
A ''frightener''?

608
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,980
It has to be timed just right.

609
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:59,250
Give me the keys, love.

610
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,080
Thanks for the lunch, sir...

611
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:02,986
and a very stimulating
conversation.

612
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,291
Bye, dad. Hope we didn't
outstay our welcome.

613
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:10,860
Not at all, Moira.

614
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,934
Mind you, he does like the osund of
his own voice, doesn't he?

615
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:17,960
You're one to talk.

616
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:23,543
In conclusion...

617
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:25,943
whatever the jury's feelings
may be...

618
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:31,315
as to what seems
the just conclusion to draw...

619
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,748
I must remind you that...

620
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:39,054
if the available evidence is not
sufficient for a conviction

621
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,527
then...

622
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:45,534
you must not convict.

623
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:51,599
This is another disaster
for the Gardai, isn't it?

624
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,300
Mr. Lynch has been found not guilty.

625
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:55,545
That is not to say that the Gardai

626
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:59,637
are pursuing anyone else
in connection with this crime.

627
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,943
It's also not to say that

628
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:02,951
the Gardai will
cease its investigations

629
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,349
in the activities
of Mr. Michael Lynch.

630
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:06,947
Do you think the justice system is
too soft on criminals, Michael?

631
00:35:07,056 --> 00:35:08,887
Michael, how can you afford such
an expensive legal team, Mr. Lynch?

632
00:35:08,992 --> 00:35:10,255
Are you back on the dole, Michael?

633
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,920
Now that you're innocent,
can you show us your face?

634
00:35:12,996 --> 00:35:14,021
Daddy.

635
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,588
There's daddy
with the black hood on him.

636
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,824
That's right.

637
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,128
Da, why are you wearing
a black hood?

638
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:19,634
Cos, I don't want them to see me.

639
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:22,570
...that Mr. Michael Lynch
is not a funny man.

640
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,197
All right, now, kids, who is he?

641
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:25,606
A Garda.

642
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,677
Is he a pig, da?

643
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:27,972
You're both right,
but you never call him a pig.

644
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:29,010
Pay attention to him,
call him a Garda

645
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:31,012
and never trust him
or anyone like him.

646
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:33,309
Come on, play it, Michael.
Are me and Lisa in it?

647
00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:34,983
It's just a little bit
you have to watch

648
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:35,951
it's in the, the beginning...

649
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:37,954
Hey, that's us.We're famous.

650
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:40,081
We're not the stars of the show,
of course.

651
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,851
We'd only be like extras, you know.

652
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:44,853
Will you go and play outside,
please.

653
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:45,860
Are you going home?

654
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:47,293
We've gotta go home in a minute.

655
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,530
All right, come on,
we'll watch it again in a while.

656
00:35:48,632 --> 00:35:50,601
Get your coats.

657
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:59,641
But it does seem that the Gardai
just can't control

658
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:01,143
the spiral of crime
in the city right now.

659
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:02,235
Does it?

660
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:17,094
Billy.

661
00:36:17,797 --> 00:36:19,057
Billy!
How are youse?

662
00:36:19,164 --> 00:36:21,222
Billy, how are you?

663
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,099
God, you're looking well tonight.

664
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:25,101
I like the suit there, big fella.
Thanks. How are you doing?

665
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:27,228
Right, fine.
How are you, Michael?

666
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:29,302
Lisa and Christine, isn't it?

667
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:31,907
Sorry, I'm not sure which is which.
Dark, you know.

668
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,034
Who's that?

669
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:35,545
It's Jerome Higgins.
He wants to talk to you.

670
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,637
Jerome Higgins?

671
00:36:38,048 --> 00:36:40,608
Since when yhave you become
the messenger boy for the IRA,

672
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,550
little fella?

673
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:42,552
Talk to him, will you?

674
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,588
A few minutes,
that's all, honestly,

675
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:45,679
it's no trouble or anything.

676
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,023
What's the problem, Michael?

677
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:52,655
I don't like being told what to do,
that's the problem.

678
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:57,865
It's grand.

679
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:01,902
I won't be long. Okay?

680
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:03,771
Billy.

681
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,572
Conversing with the riff-raff.

682
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:10,043
Glad our man, Shay Kirby,

683
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,173
was able to help you out
with that Judge, Michael.

684
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:13,773
Shay doesn't work with you
any more.

685
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:16,911
But his training, Michael.
His methods.

686
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:18,148
What are you looking for?

687
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:19,690
Well, I was just saying
to Billy there

688
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,521
that I think
there could be a lot of merit

689
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:23,253
in a bit of co-operation
between us.

690
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:25,652
Well, I don't.

691
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,561
Billy wouldn't agree with you there

692
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:30,155
and we've done a few favours
for your Billy.

693
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:31,099
Now, I suppose you know that

694
00:37:31,202 --> 00:37:34,001
we had our eye on
O'Donnells Jewellery as well.

695
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:36,231
Tough shite.

696
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:39,208
Because we thought a reasonable
cut from the what?

697
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:43,304
Two million, I believe, would be
a nice gesture to us, Michael.

698
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:45,914
Call it a symbol
of future collaboration.

699
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:49,045
How about a symbol
of future fuck all?

700
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,782
You've neither the fucking brains

701
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:51,846
or the gumption
to do your own robbing

702
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:53,722
so you think
you can come around here

703
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:55,021
and squeeze an ordinary
decent criminal, like me,

704
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:57,027
who knows something about his job.

705
00:37:57,097 --> 00:38:00,224
Fuck off and double fuck off,
Jerome.

706
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:02,998
Night, little fella.

707
00:38:03,702 --> 00:38:04,690
Excuse me.

708
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:08,831
Oh, and,
no hard feelings by the way.

709
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,168
God loves a trier

710
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:12,005
and keep your eye on the papers,
Higgins...

711
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:14,271
cos that'll be the first place
you hear about my next job

712
00:38:14,346 --> 00:38:15,746
when it's all over the front pages.

713
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:18,114
The biggest yet.
Way out of your league.

714
00:38:18,217 --> 00:38:19,550
What job are you talking about,
Michael?

715
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,086
Don't ask me, I'm making it up
as I go along.

716
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:40,936
M, it's me.

717
00:38:46,215 --> 00:38:47,202
Hi, Michael.

718
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:50,909
Look, I'm really sorry about that
you know. Look, I'm really...

719
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:52,746
Christine!

720
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:57,722
So, you got caught dealing and
now you're in hock to the IRA.

721
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,021
You fucking spaz.

722
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,097
I want you out of Dublin, fast,
little fella.

723
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,097
England, the States,
I don't care where.

724
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,896
But keep away from them
and keep away from me.

725
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:16,541
I'm sorry, Michael.

726
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:54,206
Mostly he enede up
doing religious painting

727
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:57,186
but that's only cos that's
where the money was in those days.

728
00:39:57,288 --> 00:40:00,188
Cardinals and Bishops were
always hiring artists

729
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,257
to paint scenes from the Bible.

730
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:05,152
And Lords, of course, trying to
show of how holy they were.

731
00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:09,030
He had to do a runner out of Rome
for killing some fella in a fight.

732
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:11,157
Bit of a fucking headcase,
do you know.

733
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:15,737
Michael, this isn't right.

734
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:19,097
Excuse me, my, my wife,
she needs to...

735
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,322
See Jesus and Judas...

736
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,967
Caravaggio used fellas
off the street as his models.

737
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,663
He hung around bars and
whorehouses all the time

738
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:52,333
picked out someone interesting
to be Jesus or whoever.

739
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:54,876
I think he got a kick out of that,
you know...

740
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:57,947
having Cardinals on their knees...

741
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:01,175
praying away to some painting
of a murderer or something.

742
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:04,052
What are you laughing at?

743
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,947
Oh, nothing.

744
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,682
I was just thinking about
what lasts, you know,

745
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:10,655
and who gets the benefit.

746
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:12,855
I mean, your man who painted this

747
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,592
he never saw any of the money
it's supposed to be worth, right?

748
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,661
But he gets the reputation though

749
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:20,000
I mean, people remember who he is.

750
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,096
And that's the thing, isn't it?

751
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,175
You're afraid no-one'll
remember you after you're dead?

752
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,177
I think
you should take up painting.

753
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,007
Why? So I'll be remembered?

754
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,775
Nah. So you could do the kitchen.

755
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:52,202
Hello, yeah?

756
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,632
Father Grogan?

757
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:55,137
Paul Grogan, yes, that's me.

758
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,969
My name's Christine.

759
00:41:57,074 --> 00:41:58,871
I phoned you about the Caravaggio.

760
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,307
Oh, yes, of course.

761
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,072
Come in, you're welcome.

762
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,639
Oh, the painting was hanging
right down here for years

763
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:09,347
looking down at everyone
having their supper

764
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:12,748
and no-one took any notice of it.

765
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:15,849
Getting dirtier and dirtier.

766
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,222
Then one day I was celebrating Mass
in our little chapel upstairs

767
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,802
remind me to show it to you
before you go.

768
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:30,034
Anyway, this morning
it was Luke's wonderfully moving

769
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:32,836
account of Veronica
washing the face of Jesus.

770
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:37,313
And I thought, we must have
that beautiful painting cleaned.

771
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,983
No idea
what was about to be uncovered

772
00:42:40,085 --> 00:42:41,847
a Caravaggio...

773
00:42:41,954 --> 00:42:43,681
I mean, a priceless original.

774
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:45,722
It was a pity for us in a way,
of course,

775
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:48,121
because it was lovely to
have it there.

776
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:51,630
But, well...
as soon as we knew its value

777
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,061
we knew it couldn't stay here.

778
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:57,568
I mean any half decent thief
could just walk in.

779
00:42:57,635 --> 00:43:00,161
The gallery made us
that very fine copy though.

780
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:01,364
Same size and all?

781
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:03,632
Oh, yes, an absolute replica.

782
00:43:04,177 --> 00:43:06,110
Oh, I couldn't tell the difference.

783
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,237
What about an art expert?

784
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:11,010
Well, he or she
would spot it in seconds.

785
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:12,777
If it really is
worth thirty million

786
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:14,615
why didn't you sell it
to the gallery

787
00:43:14,686 --> 00:43:15,746
rather than giving it to them?

788
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:19,222
Well, not blowing
our own trumpets now

789
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:24,559
but I suppose we just thought
it was the right thing to do.

790
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:45,242
Won't be long,
about ten minutes I suspect.

791
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:46,945
Okay, lads, good luck.

792
00:44:25,826 --> 00:44:27,793
What the bloody hell's he doing?

793
00:45:06,635 --> 00:45:07,567
Get out of the car.

794
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,331
Get out of the fucking car!

795
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:22,943
Yes!

796
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,882
Did you see their fucking faces?

797
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:27,952
Raferty van, that's it, that's it.

798
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:29,887
Get after him, Con.
Turn the car around, get her round!

799
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:31,322
Shut up. I'm, like, doing it.

800
00:45:31,592 --> 00:45:33,322
Oh their tail.
We'll lose them, hurry up!

801
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:35,255
Would you, for fuck's sake,
just shut up!

802
00:45:54,016 --> 00:45:55,278
Okay, we're up on them.

803
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,177
Right, steady as you go, Con,
steady as you go now.

804
00:45:57,286 --> 00:45:57,878
Nice and handy.

805
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:59,146
Fuck!

806
00:45:59,255 --> 00:46:01,188
The door's open, now's your chance.

807
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,088
What's the fucking matter with you?
It's only a picture!

808
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:06,025
Jesus Christ!
Come on.

809
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,300
I knew we were a country
that respects art.

810
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:20,965
Yes.

811
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:24,177
You never mind if there's bastards
out there trying to get you.

812
00:46:24,246 --> 00:46:26,237
They're only satisfied
when they can grind you down,

813
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:28,510
keep you poor, put you away.

814
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:31,018
They don't count. Not with us.

815
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,318
In fact, I think we can give them
the run around any time we like

816
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:34,887
cos they're only eejits.

817
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,585
Mentioning no names like.

818
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,719
And this thing of me becoming
a bit of a TV star lately

819
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:41,320
I want you all to know

820
00:46:41,597 --> 00:46:45,864
it's not gonna change me
one little bit.

821
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:48,237
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

822
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,568
We're top of the ratings, lads.

823
00:46:50,673 --> 00:46:51,867
They might even give us
our own series.

824
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:56,809
...valuable painting Caravaggio,
''The Taking of Christ''

825
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:57,208
was stolen in broad daylight

826
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,978
by an unknown criminal gang
posing as American tourists.

827
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:04,815
And none of them have
a fucking clue as to who did it.

828
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,114
Oh, you wanna see the bum shot?

829
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,987
What the fuck is a bum shot?

830
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:15,259
Oh, Jesus.

831
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,831
Look at that arse on you, man.

832
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:21,961
Michael, the painting,
how are we gonna get rid of it?

833
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,563
It's all sussed.

834
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,233
Alec is going to Amsterdam
next week to see a fence.

835
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,670
Let him make us an offer.

836
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:31,269
But the crack is, in the meantime
while we're waiting for all of that

837
00:47:31,547 --> 00:47:33,708
we can just sit back
and watch the Gardai

838
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:34,840
make a pig's mickey of it.

839
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:36,909
I'll drink to that.

840
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,184
Michael, any idea how much we'll
get for this holy picture here?

841
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:42,588
Like, just cos
it's valued at thirty million.

842
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,682
We'll get enough to get rich,
don't worry.

843
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,059
The point is, we've won.

844
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:50,601
I mean, you see ths,
you see all this?

845
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,795
Think about what it means.

846
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,666
We're number one,
not the Gardai

847
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,266
not the IRA, not anyone else.

848
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,239
The whole country is in awe of us.

849
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:04,246
Because of a little divine
intervention here from...

850
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:06,317
we're bigger than Riverdance.

851
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,715
One day at a time...

852
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:17,695
sweet Jesus,
that's all I'm asking of you

853
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:25,760
Just give me the strength to
do everything that I have to do

854
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,797
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus

855
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:35,677
And tomorrow may never be mine

856
00:48:42,755 --> 00:48:44,052
I think this is the signal.

857
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:44,987
Watch... see?

858
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,217
Spot on.

859
00:48:47,293 --> 00:48:49,556
Well, it's the signal itself
that got to me, sir.

860
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:51,094
Well, you're right,
he's giving a signal but...

861
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:53,063
he's imitating the painting, sir.

862
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,132
Same as your man Judas there.

863
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:56,599
Oh, right, very clever, but...

864
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:58,637
Yeah, it's smart.

865
00:48:58,704 --> 00:49:02,572
Obviously someone that likes a gag.
Someone that likes a joke.

866
00:49:02,675 --> 00:49:05,041
That's what made me realise
it's Michael Lynch.

867
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:07,271
We can't get a positive ID
from that picture, sir,

868
00:49:07,547 --> 00:49:10,880
but I did body size and shape
comparisons with Lynch and Brady.

869
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,146
Heads, heights, everything,
they match.

870
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:15,311
Very interesting, Noel, well doen.

871
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,052
Good to see the gizmos being
put to use and so on,

872
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,182
but it's a coincidence.

873
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:21,954
Your nose alone
should tell you that

874
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:24,222
Lynch is not capable of
this kind of thing.

875
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:26,594
I went back over
some of the security videos

876
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:27,632
from the art gallery, sir.
I found this.

877
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:31,637
Lynch and his wife Christine
on a day out.

878
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:33,103
I know it's not
evidence of anything, sir

879
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:35,664
but what the fuck
is Michael Lynch doing

880
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:37,505
at a seventeenth century
Italian art exhibition?

881
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,875
My wife went to that exhibition!

882
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,574
I'm sorry, but we'd look like fools

883
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:44,980
presenting that idea
to the top lads in Interlope.

884
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:47,815
If my training with the FBI
has taught me anything,

885
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,581
it's these specialist robberies

886
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:51,679
are the preserve of
a few international gangs.

887
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:55,920
Germans, Dutch, art thieves that
really know their business.

888
00:49:56,028 --> 00:49:57,291
Come on, Noel, admit it.

889
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,965
Lynch just isn't in that league.

890
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:06,672
Behave yourself.

891
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:14,737
Oh, charge it to room 764, please.

892
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:18,079
No... Peter. In fairness you've
travelled a long way to meet us.

893
00:50:18,152 --> 00:50:19,744
You have to let me pay this time.

894
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:21,913
Hey, you know it's no problem.

895
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:23,047
You'll be paying
the hotel bill anyway.

896
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:23,920
Hey, Alec, he's right.
He's fucking right.

897
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,219
So we will.

898
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:27,885
Hey, I like your style, Peter.

899
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:29,896
Smart fella there.
I like that.

900
00:50:29,996 --> 00:50:31,657
Oh phone call. Won't be long.

901
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:34,291
Hey, Peter, I think that slapper
over there has her eye on you.

902
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,231
What's a slapper?

903
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:38,202
Yeah... no, yeah, no,
half eleven's fine, yea...

904
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,739
No... I'll be there, yeah...

905
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,036
It's certainly not the MO
of any gang that we know.

906
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,204
Which suggests very strongly that

907
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:48,010
it's a very clever
local Irish operation.

908
00:50:48,114 --> 00:50:51,606
You've probably come to that
conclusion yourselves already.

909
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:53,880
Oh yes, oh, indeed, aye.

910
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:58,090
Well, of course we're
pretty confident at this stage

911
00:50:58,193 --> 00:51:01,320
that this is the work of
a gang led by Michael Lynch.

912
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:03,893
Now, I'm personally familiar
with Lynch's MO

913
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:06,898
and though normally art theft
isn't really histhing,

914
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:09,969
this particular robbery seems to
have his mark on it all right.

915
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:13,003
If you know who you're dealing with

916
00:51:13,108 --> 00:51:15,905
it will make a recovery operation
much easier.

917
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:20,708
We know that someone here in Dublin

918
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:23,840
has made contact with a fence
in Amsterdam.

919
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,545
Let us call him Peter.

920
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,280
Peter had made contact with us

921
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:29,614
to offer his co-operation.

922
00:51:56,284 --> 00:51:58,081
Good afternoon, lads.

923
00:51:58,153 --> 00:51:58,675
All set?

924
00:51:58,788 --> 00:51:59,617
All ready, sir.

925
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:00,746
Noel...

926
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:02,085
Yes, sir?

927
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:03,353
Get to work.

928
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:04,592
Right away, sir.

929
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:12,925
Whatever you do,

930
00:52:13,036 --> 00:52:14,195
don't say anything to him
about where you're taking him,

931
00:52:14,302 --> 00:52:15,963
or mention anything
about the painting at all.

932
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:16,969
Okay.

933
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:18,565
Not a word.

934
00:52:18,675 --> 00:52:19,664
I mean it. Good luck.

935
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:21,005
See you there, Michael.

936
00:52:22,277 --> 00:52:24,644
Do you like art, generally?

937
00:52:24,715 --> 00:52:27,148
What do you think of the painting?

938
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,777
Oh, I couldn't give a shite, man,
to be honest with you.

939
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:34,152
Well, it's a beautiful Caravaggio,
isn't it?

940
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,224
Well, of course I realize,

941
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:41,728
well, I suppse that
money is your main interest.

942
00:52:44,668 --> 00:52:46,693
I can tell you,
you don't like to talk,

943
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:48,864
you have no interest
in conversation.

944
00:52:48,972 --> 00:52:51,668
Not true. I love a good chat, man.

945
00:52:53,844 --> 00:52:56,643
So, these are the beautiful
Dublin mountains.

946
00:52:56,748 --> 00:52:57,873
Spotter plane.

947
00:52:57,981 --> 00:52:59,244
They've got it, sir.

948
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:00,940
All right.

949
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:04,016
Let's hope
the weather remains fine,

950
00:53:04,123 --> 00:53:05,987
especially if
we have to view outdoors.

951
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:15,632
Where do you want it?

952
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:16,994
The Caravaggio?

953
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:18,228
Upright somewhere.

954
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:19,268
Lean it against the tree there.

955
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:20,860
It's so strange to be standing on
a wooded mountain top

956
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:26,204
looking at one of the great
marvels of Renaissance art.

957
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:28,974
''The Taking Of Christ'',
by Caravaggio.

958
00:53:33,954 --> 00:53:35,784
What are you shouting for?

959
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,085
Oh, sorry, was I?

960
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:45,858
A little excited perhaps.
After all, this is a...

961
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:52,960
Right. So, tell me, are you happy
with your examination?

962
00:53:53,072 --> 00:53:55,699
Yes, very happy.

963
00:53:56,141 --> 00:53:59,838
Right then, lads, follow me.

964
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,105
Back to Roundwood okay?

965
00:54:04,251 --> 00:54:06,240
Roundwood. Got him.

966
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:08,184
Units 2,3 and 6, Roundwood.

967
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:12,918
I want a complete roadblock.
All roads in. All roads out.

968
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,958
All units to Roundwood...

969
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:19,989
Copy that, control.
Unit 6 on our way to Roundwood.

970
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:23,625
Unit 5, how far away are you?

971
00:54:23,702 --> 00:54:26,297
Isn't the scenery around here
only fantastic Peter?

972
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:29,974
Of course, you've no mountains
in Holland, sure you haven't.

973
00:54:30,543 --> 00:54:32,773
No, very flat Holland.

974
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:38,273
I love your country very much.

975
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,277
Same here, Peter.

976
00:54:40,554 --> 00:54:42,954
Ireland's a great place to live,
do you know that?

977
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:44,954
Are we near Roundwood yet?

978
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:46,751
About half a mile.

979
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:49,217
As soon as we get off this road
we're as good as there.

980
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:51,559
Fantastic.
We might stop for a pint, will we?

981
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,994
Are you thirsty?

982
00:54:53,097 --> 00:54:54,998
The cheek of the man.

983
00:54:58,704 --> 00:54:59,762
Are they in position yet?

984
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:02,340
I want that roadlock rock solid
do you hear me?

985
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:04,873
Mothing repeat,
nothing is to get through.

986
00:55:05,277 --> 00:55:07,336
Unit 6, call in, where are you?

987
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:10,974
I know the very best pub
for you, Peter.

988
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:14,610
Lovely log fire.
Irish music sessions

989
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:16,119
and they serve a great pint.

990
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,853
Are you sure he said Roundwood?

991
00:55:18,925 --> 00:55:21,257
Sir, the surveillance plane can't
spot the subjects

992
00:55:21,528 --> 00:55:22,222
anywhere near Roundwood.

993
00:55:22,295 --> 00:55:23,318
What?

994
00:55:23,597 --> 00:55:24,563
He says they're not in the area.

995
00:55:24,664 --> 00:55:25,653
Well, they have to be.

996
00:55:25,764 --> 00:55:27,130
Are you sure it's Roundwood?
Over.

997
00:55:27,235 --> 00:55:28,963
Maybe they're not
out of the woods yet.

998
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:35,673
Here we go. That's Roundwood
up ahead there, Peter.

999
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:38,938
Supposed to be the highest village
in Ireland.

1000
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,980
Wouldn't mind living aroung here,
I can tell you.

1001
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,208
A lovely quiet spot.

1002
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:45,648
Yes, yes, very tranquil.

1003
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:47,780
They're just
coming into Roundwood now.

1004
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:51,646
Well, the surveillance plane
still can't spot them.

1005
00:55:51,757 --> 00:55:53,885
Well, what's going on?

1006
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,123
Oh, fuck... God forgive me.

1007
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,824
No sign of them. Nothing at all.

1008
00:56:10,378 --> 00:56:12,938
What an awful
waste of taxpayers' money.

1009
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:14,911
What's he talking about now?

1010
00:56:15,016 --> 00:56:17,813
I hope the Government will pay
for your funeral, Peter.

1011
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:19,146
It's the least they can do.

1012
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:21,018
Please, don't.

1013
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:24,217
Jesus Christ, Michael,
that was fucking amazing.

1014
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:27,318
Here, Tony, Stevie,
wasn't that the business?

1015
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:29,186
I bet the Gardas are sitting there
thinking,

1016
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:31,731
''What the fuck are we
after letting ourselves in for?''

1017
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:34,235
''There is no way
we can get all these fuckers''

1018
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:36,293
''they're untouchable.''

1019
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:10,329
You knew all along, didn't you?

1020
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,239
How do you mean?

1021
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,809
Like, explain it to me.

1022
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:16,277
What the fuck
did we go through all that for

1023
00:57:16,545 --> 00:57:18,514
if you knew Peter was a fake?

1024
00:57:18,614 --> 00:57:21,550
They're gonna feel so stupid.

1025
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,143
The Gardas are gonna think
they'll never get the better of us.

1026
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:27,914
Yeah, maybe.

1027
00:57:28,023 --> 00:57:30,686
I just wouldn't try that one
with stevie right now.

1028
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,559
Stevie? Fuck him
if he's got no sense of humor.

1029
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:13,969
On the night, He was betrayed.

1030
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,528
He took bread and gave you thanks

1031
00:58:17,606 --> 00:58:21,737
and praise. He broke the bread
gave it to his disciples and said

1032
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:26,806
''Take this all of you nd eat it
this is my body''

1033
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:29,043
''which will be given up for you.''

1034
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:53,333
May He make us an everlasting gift
to you

1035
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:57,137
and enable us to share
in the inheritance of your Saints

1036
00:58:57,213 --> 00:59:00,775
with Mary,
The Virgin Mother of God

1037
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:02,284
with the Apostles...
the Martyrs...

1038
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:28,610
Right, Michael,
we're up your arse now.

1039
00:59:31,148 --> 00:59:33,014
Michael...

1040
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:34,675
Take a look at
what's happening outside.

1041
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,273
What?

1042
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:37,077
Look!

1043
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:43,224
What the fuck...

1044
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:03,139
Hi, cunts.

1045
01:00:03,215 --> 01:00:05,204
Shut your fucking mouth,
you little toerag.

1046
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:07,284
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

1047
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:09,248
I'll fucking shut it for you.

1048
01:00:09,353 --> 01:00:12,222
Alec, come here. I'll fucking
shut it for you, you runt.

1049
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:21,989
Lads. It's Christine.

1050
01:00:22,099 --> 01:00:23,864
How are you all?

1051
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:27,268
Bastards.

1052
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,175
Come on. Let's see what they're at.
Thisi s something new...

1053
01:00:32,244 --> 01:00:34,235
we just ignore 'em,
no matter what they do.

1054
01:00:34,347 --> 01:00:36,177
Right, lads?

1055
01:00:36,248 --> 01:00:37,112
Alec...
What?

1056
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:38,148
They don't exist.

1057
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,581
I wouldn't fucking touch them.

1058
01:00:39,686 --> 01:00:41,675
Then again I might have to
give someone a good kicking.

1059
01:00:43,822 --> 01:00:46,313
Your escorts. Here boys,
we'll look after you.

1060
01:00:46,592 --> 01:00:48,253
You fucking wanker,
get out of my way.

1061
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:52,025
That baldy fuck's supposed to be
a mastermind criminal?

1062
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,621
You must be joking

1063
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,360
just a thick gobshite
who got lucky I'd say.

1064
01:00:55,635 --> 01:00:56,793
Well, he's fucked now.

1065
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:58,804
Hey, Lynch,
are you listening to me?

1066
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:00,806
Can you feel it, can you?

1067
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:02,001
You might as well give up now.

1068
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:04,135
Cos we're gonna be glues
to your arse from now on.

1069
01:01:04,211 --> 01:01:06,804
Yeah, like flies on shite.

1070
01:01:55,195 --> 01:01:57,664
Hey, girls, you got a minute?

1071
01:01:57,764 --> 01:01:58,697
What's up with you?

1072
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,958
Oh, nothing.

1073
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:03,094
Fucking Gardas, you know,
getting on me nerves.

1074
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,797
Listen, I need one of you
to drive me later on.

1075
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:07,333
So where are the Gardas gonna be?

1076
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:09,632
Are you gonna fucking hlep me
or not?

1077
01:02:10,244 --> 01:02:11,141
Yeah.

1078
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:14,306
Keep your hair on.

1079
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,318
Why can't you cops
leave people alone?

1080
01:02:28,597 --> 01:02:31,088
How can they keep this up?
This is harassment.

1081
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:32,291
How many of them are there?

1082
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:34,932
How are we supposed to work
with the cops all over us?

1083
01:02:35,003 --> 01:02:36,630
I don't recognize any of them.

1084
01:02:36,737 --> 01:02:39,262
Would somebody call the Gardas,
sort out this mess?

1085
01:02:39,373 --> 01:02:40,965
They're never around
when you need them.

1086
01:02:41,076 --> 01:02:43,737
It's just no fun any more,
is it, Lisa?

1087
01:02:44,144 --> 01:02:46,614
time's up and I think you know it.

1088
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:48,916
I've had a contact about
the painting, Michael.

1089
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:49,880
Yeah?

1090
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:52,043
An offer. From the IRA
a hundred grand.

1091
01:02:52,152 --> 01:02:54,588
Not great, I know,

1092
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,054
but it's better than
letting the thing just rot away.

1093
01:02:56,123 --> 01:02:58,056
Their man Higgins said,
if you did the deal

1094
01:02:58,126 --> 01:02:59,592
it would be okay about Billy.

1095
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:00,353
Sorry?

1096
01:03:00,628 --> 01:03:02,789
Like, if he comes to Dublin,
there'd be no hassle.

1097
01:03:02,898 --> 01:03:04,797
You talked to Higgins about Billy?

1098
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:05,990
Look, let's do the deal

1099
01:03:06,101 --> 01:03:07,965
so thowe fuckers go after the IRA
and let us alone.

1100
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:10,800
Fucking sure anyway, it's not
our kind of stuff, you know

1101
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:11,771
this art shite.

1102
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,034
Let the IRA deal with it, man.

1103
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:15,804
Look at all these Gardas...
look what we've done to them,

1104
01:03:15,911 --> 01:03:17,675
we've dragged them
down to our level.

1105
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,213
They're acting like criminals now.

1106
01:03:19,315 --> 01:03:21,282
I'm their worst fucking nightmare.

1107
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,246
And now you're telling me
you want to get rid of the painting

1108
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:25,753
the thing we'll be remembered for.

1109
01:03:26,856 --> 01:03:27,947
You think
he'll give you a hundred grand?

1110
01:03:28,056 --> 01:03:28,784
Yeah.

1111
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:30,356
Like fuck he will.

1112
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:32,724
Can't you see
what Higgins is up to?

1113
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:34,820
It's not about the money,
it's not about the painting.

1114
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:36,295
It's about splitting us.

1115
01:03:36,565 --> 01:03:39,329
Michael, we're robbers.
We rob for a living.

1116
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:41,092
I'm not making a living any more.

1117
01:03:41,204 --> 01:03:45,264
Yeah, I know, you need things.
You want money, I know.

1118
01:03:45,373 --> 01:03:47,172
Michael, they're coming.

1119
01:03:47,275 --> 01:03:49,835
Will you have a think about it
what we've been saying?

1120
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,311
Will you, Michael?

1121
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:55,047
Tell Higgins I'll let him know.

1122
01:03:55,117 --> 01:03:56,675
And I'll let him know too.

1123
01:03:56,786 --> 01:03:58,719
And I hope we're talking about
the same thing.

1124
01:04:00,288 --> 01:04:02,052
See you later, Michael.

1125
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:05,025
D'you fancy a pint, copper?

1126
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:15,699
Look at the time,
I'll be late picking up me kids.

1127
01:04:24,248 --> 01:04:26,739
Michael Lynch.
And how are you today?

1128
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:30,048
What's this?

1129
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:35,014
Your benefits have been rescinded.

1130
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:36,851
Try that one again.

1131
01:04:37,226 --> 01:04:39,057
It's the Government.

1132
01:04:39,163 --> 01:04:40,289
I just got the order.

1133
01:04:40,563 --> 01:04:44,125
You see,
they've cut off your payments.

1134
01:04:52,175 --> 01:04:54,201
So I have to...

1135
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:55,869
you know, I, I, I can't...

1136
01:04:55,978 --> 01:04:57,844
You think
you can break me like this?

1137
01:04:57,914 --> 01:05:01,373
You're off your fucking head.

1138
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:04,751
Would you stop for a minute
and listen.

1139
01:05:04,855 --> 01:05:07,014
Can't you see
where it's all heading, Michael?

1140
01:05:07,088 --> 01:05:08,387
Only the one way...

1141
01:05:08,623 --> 01:05:10,592
You've been prison twenty years

1142
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:11,719
Me, Lisa, the kids...

1143
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:13,989
No, no, I wouldn't
let it fucking happen...

1144
01:05:14,096 --> 01:05:18,090
Michale Lynch, Norman here, good morning

1145
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:21,161
Tell you the news about donor

1146
01:05:21,271 --> 01:05:23,797
I'd say
Christine's very pissed off.

1147
01:05:23,907 --> 01:05:26,172
You ugly bag os shite.

1148
01:05:28,146 --> 01:05:31,706
You're losing it, Lynch, so fast.

1149
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,014
As long as you live...

1150
01:05:33,117 --> 01:05:34,844
Stop it...

1151
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:36,648
we'll be here watching you.

1152
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:37,880
No escape.

1153
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:39,853
Fuck off, Michael.

1154
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:43,188
Christine, did we wake you?

1155
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:45,822
Do you really think they'll ever
let you get away, Michael...

1156
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:46,657
All right.

1157
01:05:46,762 --> 01:05:47,697
after all you did?

1158
01:05:47,766 --> 01:05:48,697
All right, you're right,

1159
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:49,893
but they're never gonna
fucking put me away,

1160
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:51,994
you hear me, no matter
what they fucking do. Never.

1161
01:05:52,103 --> 01:05:53,264
They're out to get you.
What can you do it?

1162
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:54,237
What can I do about it?

1163
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:56,331
I'll tell you
what I'll fucking do about it...

1164
01:05:56,608 --> 01:05:58,371
Christine...

1165
01:05:59,077 --> 01:06:01,273
Sorry for the disturbance,
Christine.

1166
01:06:08,887 --> 01:06:09,784
Bastards.

1167
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:17,052
I never thought
they'd get this close.

1168
01:06:24,202 --> 01:06:25,635
Hey, Lynch...

1169
01:06:25,737 --> 01:06:27,329
What's so, what?

1170
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:28,936
Show us your ugly mug.

1171
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:31,269
If they were me down,
then it was all worth nothing.

1172
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:33,277
I'll lose everything.

1173
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,271
You... Lisa... the kids.

1174
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:52,596
What about the painting?
If we got some money...

1175
01:06:52,699 --> 01:06:54,291
I wasn't in it for the money.

1176
01:06:54,568 --> 01:06:57,001
In it for the crack.

1177
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:58,967
I got a few good laughs
out of it.

1178
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:04,974
You know what you are?

1179
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,309
That good, yeah?

1180
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,112
Wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea,
but it suits me.

1181
01:07:34,108 --> 01:07:35,701
That is disgusting.

1182
01:07:35,811 --> 01:07:37,675
Hey, keep the noise down, Lynch.

1183
01:08:18,686 --> 01:08:20,712
How are you, Michael?

1184
01:08:21,155 --> 01:08:23,180
You got me offer?

1185
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:25,190
So what do you think?

1186
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:28,957
Last time we spoke
I told you to go fuck yourself.

1187
01:08:30,032 --> 01:08:32,728
Things have changed a bit
since then, haven't they?

1188
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:33,891
That's right, Michael.

1189
01:08:34,002 --> 01:08:36,265
I mean, all these lads, following
it's not good, you know?

1190
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:38,095
one has to face facts.

1191
01:08:38,206 --> 01:08:40,140
You cut your cloth, Michael.

1192
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:42,237
So I suppose
it'll come as a bit of a shock

1193
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,539
when I tell you
to go fuck yourself again.

1194
01:08:44,613 --> 01:08:46,637
I'd tear up that painting
and wipe me hole with it

1195
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,215
before I let you near it.

1196
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:51,350
It's too late for you, Michael.

1197
01:08:51,619 --> 01:08:54,612
There's no Lord Mayors begging to
do you favours any more.

1198
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:56,885
That's long gone.

1199
01:08:56,992 --> 01:08:57,890
I've a picture in me head of you

1200
01:08:57,993 --> 01:09:00,256
sitting with your grandchild
on your knee.

1201
01:09:00,362 --> 01:09:02,989
A bit of drool
coming slowly down your chin.

1202
01:09:03,064 --> 01:09:05,192
Talking shite.

1203
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,859
Michael who?

1204
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:30,989
We have a show. Tony.

1205
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:40,126
Michael.

1206
01:09:40,237 --> 01:09:41,567
Tony.

1207
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:44,636
I've been fucking you around,
haven't I?

1208
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:47,873
Yeah, you have, Michael.

1209
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:50,139
I'm sorry.

1210
01:09:51,081 --> 01:09:53,845
Well, it's to be expected
with all this shite going on.

1211
01:09:53,951 --> 01:09:55,578
Yeah, but whatever Stevie's up to,

1212
01:09:55,652 --> 01:09:57,279
he's gonna make things worse.
You know that, don't you?

1213
01:09:57,554 --> 01:09:59,613
No, I don't
He's only trying to sort things.

1214
01:09:59,722 --> 01:10:01,054
Get us back to where we were.

1215
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:02,886
Oh, you think that's what
Higgins wants? You believe that?

1216
01:10:02,993 --> 01:10:04,961
What choice do we have?
You're not helping.

1217
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:10,963
Do you think
any of these fellas can lip-read?

1218
01:10:11,603 --> 01:10:14,230
You'd be amazed the skills
the Gardas have these days.

1219
01:10:18,643 --> 01:10:21,077
You're fantastic lads.

1220
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,171
Do you know that?

1221
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:26,944
He's got a crack.

1222
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:29,650
For Christ sake, Michael.

1223
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,384
Tell me then. What's next?

1224
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:37,194
Stevie's gonna try to get
the painting to Higgins, isn't he?

1225
01:10:37,261 --> 01:10:38,729
With or without me.

1226
01:10:40,765 --> 01:10:43,734
Come on, we all know that, Tony.

1227
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:45,894
So how's he gonna
get away from the Gardas?

1228
01:10:48,405 --> 01:10:50,600
It's a good plan.
I think it'll work.

1229
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:53,872
Fair enough.
Tell it to me then.

1230
01:10:55,345 --> 01:10:57,712
Come on, trust me with it,
will you?

1231
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:01,213
You know Copeland Grove?

1232
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:02,182
Yeah.

1233
01:11:02,252 --> 01:11:04,016
It's a cul-de-sac, right.
With the steps at the end.

1234
01:11:04,123 --> 01:11:05,385
Yeah, leading up to Summerhill.

1235
01:11:05,623 --> 01:11:07,353
You're gonna drive up there.

1236
01:11:07,926 --> 01:11:09,827
How? All together?
One car's no good.

1237
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:11,362
No.

1238
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:13,728
No... a car each,
so you could block the road.

1239
01:11:13,798 --> 01:11:15,733
Not bad, if you can pull it off.

1240
01:11:15,835 --> 01:11:17,268
Don't see why we can't.

1241
01:11:17,368 --> 01:11:18,701
A car will be waiting for you?

1242
01:11:18,804 --> 01:11:19,862
Van.

1243
01:11:19,971 --> 01:11:21,269
Of course, for the painting.
No, that's not bad.

1244
01:11:21,372 --> 01:11:24,307
Alec can move that out
lively enough.

1245
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:27,207
Yeah. Once we get shot of
the Gardass... all we have...

1246
01:11:27,313 --> 01:11:28,574
Hold on a minute.

1247
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:30,581
That's where it'll happen.

1248
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:32,082
What?

1249
01:11:32,786 --> 01:11:34,275
Oh, you'll get rid of the Gardas
all right.

1250
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:36,382
Easily.

1251
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:40,055
Cos I think they'll be tipped off.

1252
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:42,222
Which is better for Higgins?

1253
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:43,818
To buy some painting
he can't get rid of

1254
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:45,886
or to get all of Michael Lynch's
gang arrested in one go?

1255
01:11:45,965 --> 01:11:49,094
Leaving just me for him to
come after in his own good time.

1256
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:50,792
Think about it...

1257
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:53,369
Higgins or Stevie...

1258
01:11:54,006 --> 01:11:56,030
who would the smart money be on?

1259
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,109
Look, all I'm saying...
whatever happens...

1260
01:12:05,185 --> 01:12:08,779
I promise... I'll be waiting.

1261
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:28,939
Come and get me.

1262
01:12:37,716 --> 01:12:40,048
oh, you'll get rid of
the Gardas all right.

1263
01:12:40,587 --> 01:12:41,984
Easily.

1264
01:12:42,054 --> 01:12:44,021
Cos Higgins will
have tipped them off.

1265
01:12:44,088 --> 01:12:45,680
The way me and Higgins see it is,

1266
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:48,260
if we're reasonable,
we can divide the work.

1267
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,886
Co-operate, let each other know
what we're doing,

1268
01:12:50,997 --> 01:12:52,896
that kind of thing, so as we
don't get in each other's way.

1269
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:53,694
Yeah.

1270
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:55,131
While the cops are looking for us,

1271
01:12:55,235 --> 01:12:57,293
Higgins is robbing the bank
on Dame Street.

1272
01:12:57,404 --> 01:12:58,895
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Stevie,

1273
01:12:58,971 --> 01:13:00,599
I thought we were doing one thing...

1274
01:13:00,707 --> 01:13:02,197
unloading the painting

1275
01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:03,606
to try and get everything
back to normal Persuade...

1276
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:06,770
Yeah, normal that means no Michael.

1277
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:08,643
Cos he's not normal any more,
is he?

1278
01:13:08,747 --> 01:13:10,773
Alec, pull up here.

1279
01:13:11,152 --> 01:13:14,677
If anything goes against us...
It'll be nothing to do with me.

1280
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,787
Yeah?

1281
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:20,951
It's Tony, you were right, Michael.

1282
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:22,288
Stevie's gone over to Higgins.

1283
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:24,262
Okay... Are you free?
Anyone on to you?

1284
01:13:24,363 --> 01:13:26,594
Nah, not a Garda in sight.

1285
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:27,859
Jesus, yes. Right.

1286
01:13:27,934 --> 01:13:30,128
Liten, have you found out anything?

1287
01:13:30,235 --> 01:13:31,362
Where's Higgins picking up
the painting?

1288
01:13:31,604 --> 01:13:33,298
It's Stevie
who's doing the pick-up.

1289
01:13:33,573 --> 01:13:35,905
Apparently while he's
collecting the painting...

1290
01:13:35,975 --> 01:13:38,274
Higgins is planning to rob a bank.

1291
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:41,007
I think it's some plan
to confuse the Gardas.

1292
01:13:41,983 --> 01:13:42,949
Do you know where?

1293
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,576
The Metro Bank in Dame Street,
Stevie said.

1294
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:47,279
Jut before mid-day.

1295
01:13:48,154 --> 01:13:49,349
All right, here's what you do...

1296
01:13:49,622 --> 01:13:51,113
you get there now, fast,
to check it out.

1297
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,216
And make sure
you're not being followed.

1298
01:13:52,326 --> 01:13:52,952
Yeah.

1299
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,083
Ring me in fifteen minutes.

1300
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:55,127
Okay.

1301
01:13:55,229 --> 01:13:57,128
Oh, and Tony...
Yeah?

1302
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:58,859
What are you wearing by the way?

1303
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:03,970
Well?

1304
01:14:04,805 --> 01:14:05,395
What?

1305
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:07,131
Have you two kissed and made up?

1306
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,904
Me and Tony? Oh, yeah, sure.

1307
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:10,842
Good.

1308
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:13,005
Can't be falling out with friends
like him.

1309
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:22,149
Listen girls...

1310
01:14:22,957 --> 01:14:25,188
I think I'm gonna be able to
fix things, you know

1311
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:27,853
so you wont' be
walking the streets begging.

1312
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:30,625
Tony and me have come up
with something...

1313
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:33,930
something very tasty.
Like this...

1314
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:37,204
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

1315
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:38,934
Don't worry. It's grand, Michael.

1316
01:14:39,777 --> 01:14:42,074
Go on so.
Get out from under our feet.

1317
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:46,046
Wish me luck, girls, there's
a lot of bad people out there.

1318
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,215
Hi, da.

1319
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:50,579
Nothing yet, Michael.

1320
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:51,643
Maybe Stevie was bullshitting.

1321
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,282
I don't thinkso.
I think we're in business, Tony.

1322
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,688
All right, now are you listening?
Yeah.

1323
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:57,725
Here's how it's gonna happen.

1324
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:01,887
You hang around inside the bank.
I'll be outside.

1325
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,108
There'll be the usual Gardas
in attendance.

1326
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:14,939
But not so many.

1327
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:17,740
Remember...
Higgins will betray Stevie...

1328
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,145
At last we can make
some fucking money on this thing.

1329
01:15:20,248 --> 01:15:21,876
So most of the armed units

1330
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:24,011
will be chasing him and Alec
to get the painting.

1331
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:35,688
Now once Higgins' boys arrive...
we're off and running.

1332
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:58,113
I'm disappointed in you, Shay.

1333
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,622
Mother of Christ.

1334
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:06,060
That's Shay Kirby.

1335
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,890
Let's check it out.

1336
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,024
Good morning.
I'd like to apply for a loan.

1337
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,005
Thank you.

1338
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:18,765
How's it going, Shay?

1339
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:19,864
Put it down. Drop it.

1340
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:21,171
Put it down, now. Drop it.

1341
01:16:21,246 --> 01:16:22,644
Take it easy, Shay.

1342
01:16:22,746 --> 01:16:24,940
Put it down!
Now!

1343
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:29,144
Put it down!
Do it. Nice and easy.

1344
01:16:29,253 --> 01:16:31,619
Stand up! Turn around!

1345
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:32,814
Against the wall.

1346
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,117
Fuck!

1347
01:16:35,993 --> 01:16:38,689
Alec, watch the fucking painting.
Jesus Christ.

1348
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:44,795
Don't move a fucking muscle.

1349
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:47,131
Fuck me. What the fuck
are we gonna do, man?

1350
01:16:47,238 --> 01:16:49,569
Right,
keep the fucking painting up...

1351
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:51,230
Right, right,
we keep behind the painting.

1352
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:51,966
Why?

1353
01:16:52,076 --> 01:16:53,100
Keep behind the fucking painting!

1354
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:54,268
Right, right.
Come on, back we go then.

1355
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:55,242
Right.

1356
01:16:55,345 --> 01:16:56,643
Shite!

1357
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,176
Go...
Fucking back up.

1358
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:06,314
Drop the guns!

1359
01:17:09,126 --> 01:17:10,252
Drop the guns!

1360
01:17:12,162 --> 01:17:13,130
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1361
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,698
Drop the fucking picture!

1362
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:42,157
Everybody...
On your knees now.

1363
01:17:46,797 --> 01:17:48,323
Get down.

1364
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:52,033
You're a fucking arsehole.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1365
01:17:52,136 --> 01:17:53,865
Michael would never have gotten us
into this fucking mess.

1366
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:56,703
Cara-fucking-vaggio.

1367
01:18:06,985 --> 01:18:08,578
Fuck art!

1368
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:14,350
All right, Liam, he's safe.

1369
01:18:14,627 --> 01:18:15,617
We need back-up.

1370
01:18:15,962 --> 01:18:17,222
This is foxtrot one calling...

1371
01:18:17,296 --> 01:18:19,320
we request immediate
armed assistance.

1372
01:18:19,599 --> 01:18:20,792
We've got a situation here.

1373
01:18:20,867 --> 01:18:22,630
All armed units are
chasing that painting!

1374
01:18:22,734 --> 01:18:24,100
Fucking bollocks!

1375
01:18:25,171 --> 01:18:26,832
What the fuck are you looking at?

1376
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:28,270
All right let's move.

1377
01:18:28,908 --> 01:18:30,068
Right, stay there.

1378
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:33,840
You'll have to sign for that boys.

1379
01:18:42,288 --> 01:18:44,554
Drop the gun.

1380
01:18:47,694 --> 01:18:48,922
Don't... don't fucking shoot me!

1381
01:18:48,996 --> 01:18:52,829
Drop the gun.
Nice and easy.

1382
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:56,028
Michael Lynch is involved. This is
a highly dangerous situation.

1383
01:18:56,136 --> 01:18:59,037
We're doing our best, but we've
no armed units right now.

1384
01:18:59,105 --> 01:19:01,971
For fuck's sake,
we need armed units, now!

1385
01:19:08,981 --> 01:19:10,677
Holy shit.

1386
01:19:10,783 --> 01:19:13,252
Hope they dont' take that
out of your wages, boss.

1387
01:19:14,253 --> 01:19:16,222
Sorry, Noel,
we've got urgent calls.

1388
01:19:16,323 --> 01:19:19,257
There's an armed robbery going on
in the Metro Bank in Dame Street.

1389
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:22,125
They're still inside,
and apparently one of the's Lynch.

1390
01:19:26,533 --> 01:19:27,556
Fuck!

1391
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:30,162
How the fuck did he...

1392
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:32,204
I've no idea.

1393
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:35,867
Tell them to keep him there.

1394
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:37,136
Whatever they do, keep him there.

1395
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:38,143
Right, Noel.

1396
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:39,769
Come on, lads, out of here.
Come on, move.

1397
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,747
Luke, get on to Control.
I want cars down there now.

1398
01:19:43,817 --> 01:19:45,283
And get those guys out of the bank.

1399
01:19:46,953 --> 01:19:49,082
Michael Lynch talking.
Do you hear me?

1400
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:52,751
I'm coming out.
I'm giving myself up. Okay?

1401
01:19:54,061 --> 01:19:55,188
What do you want me to do?

1402
01:19:55,296 --> 01:19:56,957
Die, you motherfucker.

1403
01:19:57,030 --> 01:20:00,659
Put your hands clearly in the air
and come out slowly.

1404
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:03,828
Okay. Here I come, lads.

1405
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:08,876
Keep walking towards us
until we tell you to stop.

1406
01:20:08,943 --> 01:20:11,707
You fellas are gonna be famous
do you know that?

1407
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:13,703
Shoot the fucker.

1408
01:20:13,782 --> 01:20:15,042
Put your gun down.

1409
01:20:19,287 --> 01:20:20,752
Walk away from it.

1410
01:20:20,822 --> 01:20:23,381
You're dead, Lynch,
so's your fucking family.

1411
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:24,818
Shut up.

1412
01:20:28,997 --> 01:20:31,658
All right, everyone stand up.
Up, up, now.

1413
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:33,859
Go, move...

1414
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:35,027
What the...?

1415
01:20:35,136 --> 01:20:36,832
How are you doing?

1416
01:20:41,009 --> 01:20:42,873
Shoot the fucker!

1417
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:46,002
Get down...

1418
01:20:46,114 --> 01:20:47,672
Lynch is still in there.

1419
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:54,984
Keep Lynch there
whatever happens.

1420
01:20:55,055 --> 01:20:56,819
Repeat, keep Lynch there.

1421
01:20:56,891 --> 01:20:58,224
What the fuck now?

1422
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,630
Lynch, come out.

1423
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:07,725
Lynch!

1424
01:21:18,213 --> 01:21:19,805
Rifle.

1425
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:29,784
What's going on?

1426
01:21:30,126 --> 01:21:31,354
Haven't a clue.

1427
01:21:31,627 --> 01:21:33,618
But Lynch is still in there.

1428
01:21:33,695 --> 01:21:34,788
Good.

1429
01:21:39,168 --> 01:21:42,034
Are you out there, Noel?

1430
01:21:42,139 --> 01:21:45,073
I know I've been messing
with your lads

1431
01:21:45,175 --> 01:21:48,144
and they're probably a bit annoyed.

1432
01:21:48,244 --> 01:21:49,939
But this is it.

1433
01:21:50,046 --> 01:21:52,743
You have me for real this time.

1434
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,613
I'm coming out.

1435
01:21:59,288 --> 01:22:01,154
Put the gun down.

1436
01:22:03,926 --> 01:22:05,895
Put the fucking weapon down.

1437
01:22:41,099 --> 01:22:44,192
Noel... that's it?

1438
01:22:44,868 --> 01:22:47,029
Tell his wife to come
and identify the body.

1439
01:22:47,137 --> 01:22:48,264
Okay.

1440
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:07,918
Where's Michael?

1441
01:23:09,161 --> 01:23:10,684
Tony?

1442
01:23:40,658 --> 01:23:43,594
Are you Michael Lynch's wife
Christine?

1443
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:53,367
And you are his sister-in-law
Lisa?

1444
01:23:55,742 --> 01:23:56,969
Right.

1445
01:24:00,113 --> 01:24:02,104
Would you formally
identify this body

1446
01:24:02,215 --> 01:24:04,682
as that of your husband
Michael Lynch?

1447
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,881
A nod'll do.

1448
01:24:13,693 --> 01:24:15,286
Oh God.

1449
01:24:23,336 --> 01:24:26,328
Sure they'd never recognise him
with his head in that state.

1450
01:24:28,274 --> 01:24:29,242
I think they will.

1451
01:24:29,341 --> 01:24:30,832
What?

1452
01:24:36,876 --> 01:24:38,671
Oh yes, of course, right enough.

1453
01:24:44,082 --> 01:24:46,346
So, is that him then, girls?

1454
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:57,555
Yes...
this is the body of my husband.

1455
01:25:10,444 --> 01:25:12,002
Right...

1456
01:25:12,078 --> 01:25:14,945
it's over... well done.

1457
01:25:25,591 --> 01:25:27,081
Take it

1458
01:25:37,938 --> 01:25:39,529
Give me the fucking mask

1459
01:25:52,918 --> 01:25:54,546
Good morning, Jero

1460
01:25:56,922 --> 01:25:58,412
Before we go our separate ways,

1461
01:25:58,524 --> 01:26:01,085
let us take leave of
our brother Michael.

1462
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:04,426
May our farewell express
our affection for him.

1463
01:26:04,497 --> 01:26:08,194
May it ease our sadness
and strengthen our hope.

1464
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:13,538
Lynch would love this send off.

1465
01:26:15,207 --> 01:26:17,176
He's probably up there somewhere

1466
01:26:17,243 --> 01:26:20,077
having a good laugh at the idea
of us protecting him now.

1467
01:26:39,865 --> 01:26:42,163
It was the right thing to do, Noel.

1468
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:45,261
Fuck it, he's dead.

1469
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:51,503
Something between me and him, Ger.

1470
01:26:52,112 --> 01:26:54,511
It's the way
these things usually end up.

1471
01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:01,216
Now, that's what your mummy
sent you for.

1472
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:02,516
Yeah, she'll pay you tomorrow.

1473
01:27:02,622 --> 01:27:04,591
Grand. Mind yourself
crossing that road now.

1474
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,386
Okay.

1475
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,221
Bye.

1476
01:27:06,293 --> 01:27:07,453
Bye.

1477
01:27:08,195 --> 01:27:09,220
Hiya.

1478
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:13,663
Hello there.
Lovely day for it huh?

1479
01:27:13,935 --> 01:27:15,903
It certainly is.

1480
01:27:17,436 --> 01:27:18,529
And how are you today?

1481
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:22,307
Well, now...

1482
01:27:22,377 --> 01:27:24,503
Let's see now.

1483
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:27,015
Is that tins of corned beef
you have there?

1484
01:27:27,115 --> 01:27:31,212
Yep, ''John West''.
Do you want one?

1485
01:27:31,587 --> 01:27:34,282
I'll tell you what,
can you hang on to it for me?

1486
01:27:34,389 --> 01:27:35,912
I'll collect it
later on me way back.

1487
01:27:36,024 --> 01:27:38,390
Save me lugging it
around on the bike.

1488
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:42,157
Well, of course.
That's a grand bike you have.

1489
01:27:42,264 --> 01:27:44,493
I wish I had your speed.

1490
01:27:46,402 --> 01:27:48,596
Well, gets me around, you know.

1491
01:27:53,443 --> 01:27:54,876
Good luck.

1492
01:27:55,345 --> 01:27:56,505
Bye.

1493
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:57,097
Michael, you just can't live
without us, can you?

1494
01:29:24,501 --> 01:29:25,948
Bless us, oh, Lord.

1495
01:29:25,952 --> 01:29:28,779
And these thy gifts,
which of thy bounty,

1496
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,438
we are about to receive
through Christ our Lord, amen.
