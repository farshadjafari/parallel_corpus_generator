1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,960
¶ Here comes the bride

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,040
¶ Fair, fat and wide

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,240
¶ Slips on a banana peel
and goes for a ride

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,640
¶ Here comes the groom... ¶

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,400
Good morning, beautiful.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,680
Where are we?
Just passed Wanganella.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,080
How much further?
Nearly halfway.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,000
You're fucking kidding.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,600
Would I lie to you, my beautiful?

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,200
Don't call me that.
What?

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,360
'My beautiful'.
You sound like an old person.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,640
I am an old person.
Yeah, well, pretend you're not.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,680
I feel like I'm eloping
with my grandfather.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,320
¶ Well, I'm goin' up
the country

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,515
¶ Babe, don't you wanna go?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,788
¶ Well, I'm goin' up the country
Babe, don't you wanna go?

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,035
¶ Takin' you some place
I've never been before

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,836
¶ I'm goin', I'm goin'
where the water tastes like wine

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,030
¶ I'm goin' where the water
tastes like wine

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,395
¶ Can jump in the water
Stay drunk all the time

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,073
¶ I'm gonna leave this city
Got to get away... ¶

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,960
What are you looking at?
The old watering hole.

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,880
What?

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,440
The old watering hole.

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,320
Why didn't you tell me
we were nearly there?

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,992
Oh, we're not.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,600
Wal-lum-bee.
Wal-lum-bye.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,113
Is it big?

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,269
Massive.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,911
Hey, Ned?
Yeah?

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,235
Tell your dad that I am an actress.

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,560
What sort of actress?
Actress-actress, shithead.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Gotcha.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,680
I've always wanted to live
in the country,

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,680
you know, with a porch
and slaves and shit.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
Well, there's plenty of shit.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,680
Where do you reckon these slaves
are coming from?

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,600
I know. We'll go back to Wal-lum-bee...

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,920
Wal-lum-bye.

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
..to the red soil of Wal-lum-bee.

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,280
Yes, as God is my witness...

42
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,040
As God is my witness,
I will never...

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,520
Toni! Toni! Shut up!

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,796
It's a kangaroo. It's a kangaroo.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Is it dead?

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,719
Don't.

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,960
Oh, poor kanga.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,440
Oh, shit! It moved.

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
OK. Get in the car.

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,000
It's got a baby.
Get in the car.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,434
What are you gonna do?
Get in the car, Toni.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,197
Friendly-looking folk.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,200
This is it? This is what we drove
halfway across a fucking continent for?

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,159
It's called a home.
A place of refuge, succour.

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,317
Ah. Well, why not honk the horn?
Stir 'em up a little.

56
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
Alright. Alright.

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,589
Who is it?

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Ned?

59
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,280
Ned! Oh, my God!

60
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,748
Ned, you came.

61
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,640
I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna come. Come in.

62
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,400
Shut up, Bitsie.

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
Let me take that.

64
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,320
My God, look at you.
Would you have a look at you!

65
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
Oh, come here.

66
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,640
Oh!

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
You must be exhausted.
When did you leave? Let me take that.

68
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,040
You didn't drive straight through,
did you? Hmm?

69
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
Bitsie, shh!

70
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,000
It's only Ned. Hey, how's Sydney?

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,991
Jesus.
There's still tomorrow, isn't there?

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,713
Oh.

73
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,080
This is my sister Sally.
Sally, this is Toni.

74
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,559
Hi.
Hi.

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,640
Does she have a suitcase?

76
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,160
No, no. She's an actress.
They don't wear clothes.

77
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,480
Ha ha!

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,674
Oh.

79
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,720
Hey, Bitsie.

80
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
So is the old man still with us?

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,872
Bruce. Is he?

82
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,280
Yeah, yeah, course he is.
Oh, look, I'll go tell him you're here.

83
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,760
No. Don't wake him.
He'll want to know you're here, Ned.

84
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,718
We'll be here in the morning.
There's no need to wake him. Let's...

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,560
OK. Well, I'll go get sheets, huh?
OK.

86
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
Which bed do you want?

87
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,077
Can't we put them together?

88
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,840
Oh...

89
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,319
I'll, um...

90
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,397
Don't you have any doubles?

91
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,351
Yeah, I'll get 'em.
No, no, no. I'll go.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Who's Clifford?
That's my brother.

93
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,800
Is he cuter than you?
Much.

94
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,279
Older or younger?

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,680
Ned?
Huh?

96
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,194
Your brother -- older or younger?

97
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,400
Uh, older.

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,871
Damn. Cuter and younger
would have been perfect.

99
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,673
It's mine, Neddy.

100
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,189
Close your eyes.
Why?

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,640
This is Nelson's hair.

102
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,320
This is Nelson's nose.

103
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,840
This is Nelson's stump.
This is Nelson's belly.

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,115
Don't look!
I'm not!

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,520
And this is Nelson's... bum hole!

106
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,440
Shut up, Kate,
or go back to your own room.

107
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,919
You shut up, Cliff.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,275
Tickle me, Ned.

109
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,000
Walking in the jungle,
X marks the spot.

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
Dot-dash-dot-dash,

111
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,680
dot-dash-dot.

112
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,640
Knife stabs you in the back,
blood gushes down.

113
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,240
Spider bites you in the neck,

114
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,879
blood trickles down.

115
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
Tight squeeze...

116
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,990
A cool breeze.
Mmm.

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,753
Now you've got the shiveries.

118
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,634
What do you do
stuck all the way out here?

119
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,720
Oh, I work in the community.

120
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,120
What community?
The Aboriginal one.

121
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,951
You would have passed it
on the way in.

122
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,320
Well, what do you do for fun?

123
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,800
Oh, you'd be surprised.

124
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,640
Anyone looking for a piss-up
can usually find one. Right, Ned?

125
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,480
Oh, did I tell you Dougie
sold the roadhouse?

126
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,160
No.
Yeah.

127
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,880
Wanted to be closer
to the grandkids.

128
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
Would you believe
Tamara's on her fourth?

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
And ride him! Ride him!
Ride the old bull! Come on!

130
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,400
Aaah!
Get back!

131
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,640
Don't go whingeing to your mother.
Now get back up, you bloody sook!

132
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,520
You'll never be a real bull rider
if you don't get back up, Cliff.

133
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,800
Come on, Ned,
show your brother how it's done.

134
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,916
He'll see you now, Ned.

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,720
Hey, you OK?

136
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,280
Yeah, course I am. Why wouldn't I be?
Good. Good.

137
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
What happened?

138
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,720
South American heiress
dump you?

139
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,760
Uh, Toni, this is Bruce.
Bruce, this is Toni.

140
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,560
Hi.

141
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,596
This the new one?

142
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,080
A very pretty girl.

143
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,680
Then I don't suppose
you ever had any trouble picking 'em.

144
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,520
His trouble was in keeping 'em. They
all seem to get his number eventually.

145
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,560
Oh, yeah? What number's that one?

146
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,600
Don't ask me. I'm not a girl.

147
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,909
Uh, so, everyone catching up?

148
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,596
So what's wrong with you, Bruce?
I'm dying.

149
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,989
Congestive heart disease.

150
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,600
Well, it's, uh, treatable.

151
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,880
Yeah, sure it is.

152
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,400
They thin your blood,
they put you in an oxygen tent

153
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,480
and you live a couple of months longer.

154
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,515
Big deal.

155
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,680
You don't look so hot yourself.
You look soft.

156
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,360
Oh, we're not talking about me.
We're talking about you.

157
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Yeah, well, don't you worry about me.

158
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,360
I haven't come to the end
of my breathing yet.

159
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,800
Come on, since Ned's come all this way,
could we all just try to get along?

160
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,080
Yeah.

161
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,710
Maybe she's right. Maybe we need
to clean up our act, eh, Ned?

162
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,920
It's loaded.
That's the idea.

163
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,560
Yeah, Bruce reckons the
black fellas burnt down the meat shed

164
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,800
and we're next.

165
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,800
I didn't reckon anything.
That was five years ago.

166
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,439
Oi! That's enough for you.

167
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,800
Oh, Jesus.

168
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,392
Who's this?

169
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,760
My daughter.

170
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,680
She's beautiful.

171
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,600
Alright. Think I'll take a look around
before it gets too hot.

172
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,760
But all of this
has been rigorously tested.

173
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,840
I don’t want to comment too much on the
report the government’s about to put out.

174
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,720
You know as well as I do
that things get skewed in the media.

175
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,280
That’s not to say. of course. that the
government doesn’t have a position

176
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,872
that it seeks to hold as well.

177
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,755
Shit, missed!

178
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,312
Bingo! Your turn, Neddy.

179
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,397
Hang on, Neddy!

180
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Hey, do you want a hand?

181
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Ow!

182
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,560
Why'd you have to bring her, Ned?

183
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh...
Hmm?

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,440
What's your problem?

185
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,120
He's waited 20 years to see you
and he's dying.

186
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,156
Doesn't that deserve
your full attention?

187
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm here, aren't l?

188
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,240
Ned?
What?

189
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,760
Blame's a mug's game.

190
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,680
What, you tell him that too,
or is that just for me?

191
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,071
It wasn't my idea to drag you back here.
He wanted to see you.

192
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,353
Just give him a go, would you?

193
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,277
Oooh!

194
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,676
You gonna stay here after?
Hmm?

195
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,080
There's no 'here' left.
The bank's got it all.

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
What?

197
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,559
Nothing?

198
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,680
Nup.

199
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,560
Sorry to break it to you, Ned.

200
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,880
You won't get anything but the contents
of his workshop and his best wishes.

201
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,400
Yeah, that'll be the day.

202
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,920
Nuh, Bruce reckons
it's worth 50 grand.

203
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,040
You wanna see?
Nuh.

204
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,680
I'll take your word for it.

205
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,990
Have we still got those yabby traps?
Yep.

206
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,713
No dam, but.

207
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,880
What happened?

208
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,836
No rain.

209
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,514
No-one used it much after anyway.

210
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,880
Do you remember
when that leech went up my fanny?

211
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,920
Everyone thought I was haemorrhaging.

212
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

213
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,600
I remember it crawling out
all fat and happy

214
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,120
and you screaming your head off.

215
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,429
Yeah, can you blame me?

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,156
Bruce was carping on about,
"That'll teach you all to swim in the raw."

217
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,035
Didn't stop Kate but, did it?

218
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,399
Yuck.

219
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,118
What is that?

220
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,520
A witchetty grub.

221
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,680
Did she eat it?
Yep.

222
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,477
Gross.

223
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,720
Here we are.

224
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,840
Here, Dad.

225
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,480
Is she coming?

226
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,360
Who?

227
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,157
Beautiful Kate.

228
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,400
Doubt it.

229
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,160
Where is she?

230
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
She's no longer with us, Toni.

231
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,072
Is she dead?

232
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,680
Well done.

233
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,480
Wow.

234
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,680
Ah, here he is --
my one and only son and heir.

235
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,160
Did you have a good poke around,
did you? Everything to your satisfaction?

236
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,720
Front loader still running?

237
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,520
If the blacks haven't filled
the tank with sugar. Why?

238
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
You allowed a beer, Bruce?
No. Bruce can't drink on his medication.

239
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,720
Course he can.

240
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,831
Not every day a father gets to share
a drink with his long-lost son.

241
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,953
Good health.
To yours, anyway.

242
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,720
I didn't know
you had another sister, Ned.

243
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Yeah. Kate was his twin.

244
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,680
Certainly not identical.

245
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,560
No, no, certainly not.

246
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,080
But just as attractive. Right, Bruce?

247
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,760
Like I always said,
with his looks and talent,

248
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,280
he could've been famous
if it wasn't for his weakness.

249
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,872
Yeah, which one's that?

250
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,195
For cunt.

251
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,108
Finished yet?

252
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,200
Toni likes our dirty linen,
don't you, Toni?

253
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,880
- That's enough for you, Dad.
- Jesus.

254
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
Sal, have you got
some boots for her?

255
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,157
Yeah, at the door.

256
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,957
Cliff!

257
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,440
Cliff!

258
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,510
What happened?

259
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,756
Huh? What?
How did she die?

260
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,960
In a car accident.

261
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
Soon as we get all this crap buried,
we're outta here.

262
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,800
Thank God for that.

263
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,997
It's not worth the cost
of a fuckin' auctioneer.

264
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
What about your brother?
What?

265
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,560
What about your brother?
Yeah, both of them. Put these on.

266
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,320
In the accident?
Yep. Put these on.

267
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
When?
Now.

268
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,673
No, when was the accident?
Years ago.

269
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,720
So sad, Ned.

270
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,160
Hold on.

271
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,480
OK, you ready?
We're gonna turn. Ready?

272
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,040
Cliff, look at me.

273
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,680
Now, eyes on the road, Kate.

274
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,671
Not too hard on the wheel, sweetheart.

275
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,560
OK... Whoa!
Stop, Mum. I wanna show Dad.

276
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,080
Dad, look! I won, Dad! I won!

277
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,756
Dad, I won, I won! Dad, look.

278
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,872
You've got a long way to go
before you're a real bull rider, Cliff.

279
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,272
What are you looking at?

280
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:32,560
I:ve been back all of two days.
back at my father’s house.

281
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,240
So where else would I find myself
but in the old schoolroom

282
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,760
picking at my brother’s suicide
like an old scab

283
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,800
and following a trail of wounds

284
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,272
that leads inexorably
to the bastard dying next door.

285
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,920
¶ Oh. my goodness. it must be Jeff

286
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,080
¶ Wake up. Jeff
Everybody’s wiggling

287
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,840
¶ Wake up. Jeff
We really need you

288
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,840
¶ Wake up. Jeff
You’re missing all the fun now

289
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,400
¶ Wake up. Jeff.
before the day’s through... ¶

290
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,160
Ned?

291
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,240
- Tu aimes.
- He loves.

292
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,200
Il aime.
We love.

293
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,480
Nous...

294
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,160
I read in the paper here

295
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,520
that Gary Fraser's son
won a scholarship to King's.

296
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,351
Why do you think that is, Cliff?

297
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,800
Is it because he's smarter than my son
or just a harder worker?

298
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,320
Maybe because his father doesn't
make him do the work of six blacks

299
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,200
and all this French crap besides.

300
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,200
N'est-ce pas, Neddy?

301
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
Can I help you with something, Bruce?

302
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,358
What is this?

303
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,240
Can't visit my own son in my own
house? Is that against the law now?

304
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,073
Nope. Just thought
I'd get some work done.

305
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,752
Work?
Writing.

306
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,200
It's what I do. I'm a 'writer'.

307
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,512
Ah, yes. Now I remember.

308
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,880
Written anything worth reading yet?

309
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,480
No, same old tripe.

310
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,640
What was that last one you wrote?

311
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
'Half His Luck', wasn't it?

312
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,000
The one I had to hide from Sally
'cause it was so filthy.

313
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,440
You mean the one that's in its 3rd reprint
but that's not my last one, Bruce.

314
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
They get even filthier after that?

315
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,080
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's wall-to-wall
fucking now. No more smoking gun.

316
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,040
Always the smart arse,

317
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,315
even now when you're...

318
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,400
How old are you?
40.

319
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,437
Christ. Almost old yourself.

320
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,960
You know, we never got the chance
to talk about that last summer, did we?

321
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,040
What about it?
- Ned!

322
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,560
I never understood it.
I never understood any of it.

323
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,000
What's to understand?

324
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,760
Cliff swerved to avoid a roo,
Kate's killed, Cliff...

325
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
I know that!
- Ned!

326
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,040
But I thought
you might know more.

327
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,480
That's all I'm asking.

328
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,720
Huh? It was a long time ago, Bruce.
I don't remember.

329
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,320
Why did you run off like that then?
Can you answer me that?

330
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,312
Look, we couldn't do this, uh,
some other time, could we?

331
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,800
Do you have any idea
how much we needed you here?!

332
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,640
Ned!

333
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,837
Can you work this stupid thing?

334
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,552
Alright. Don't sulk.

335
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Sit on it proud.
Stick your back in a little bit.

336
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,040
That's it.

337
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,480
Now, you squeeze in with your thighs,
stick your tits out.

338
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,200
That's it. Now...

339
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,840
Put your hand up.

340
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,600
Uh... hold on with this.

341
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,800
Hands up nice and high, right?

342
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,320
You know what do to with that rope.
Hold on. Tits out.

343
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,520
Now, smile. You're happy, right?

344
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,960
You're riding the bull now. Yee-haa!

345
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
Yee-haa!

346
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,280
Just hold on.

347
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,111
Just enjoy the ride.

348
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,759
Whoo!

349
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,800
¶ Bad to the bone... ¶

350
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,280
MAN ON P.A.: Now today’s final event.
- turn -- the 3-legged race.

351
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,000
Come on. girls. Choose your bloke.
Don’t be shy now.

352
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,120
Hey, think
I might get to cop a feel?

353
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
What was that for?

354
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,640
What are you talking about,
you twerp, you butthole?

355
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,880
You haven't even kissed a girl.

356
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,520
Hey, feisty. You and me, babe.
How about it?

357
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,640
Hey, Neddy, got a partner?
Nuh.

358
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,440
You do now.

359
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,720
You're looking all grown up today,
Neddy. I like that shirt.

360
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,800
Are you gonna save a dance
for me later?

361
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,320
I might.
Hope so.

362
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,240
Where you going, baby?
Come back!

363
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,518
Stop!

364
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,000
You fuckin' did that on purpose!

365
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,992
Now you're a real cowgirl.

366
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,633
Fuck you.

367
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,680
Now what are you doing?

368
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm going to work.

369
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,080
What am I supposed to do?
Too fuckin' hot here.

370
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,440
I dunno -- have a bath,
wash your hair or something.

371
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,158
Fine, I will.

372
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,760
You want a cuppa?

373
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,830
Do you like being everyone's slave?

374
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm sorry, you just do everything
for everyone.

375
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,920
No, you're right. Tea's there.
You can make it yourself.

376
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm not saying you shouldn't.

377
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,960
Don't you get sick of it, though?
Sick of what?

378
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Fuck, if it was me, I'd leave
the bastards to get on with it.

379
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,320
Probably bloody kill each other.

380
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,518
Well, frankly, my dear, I'd risk it.

381
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,800
Mm-hm. Yeah.

382
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,320
Hey, can I come in?
Yeah, sure. Want one?

383
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,160
What is it?
Mojito.

384
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,800
Oh, yes, I do. You got lime?

385
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,360
Yeah. It's in the fridge.

386
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,320
Welcome to the Jungle Bar,

387
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,960
where everyone is beautiful
and the drinks are free.

388
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,080
Hey, George, my brother just turned up.

389
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,680
Say hi to Ned.

390
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,320
Hello. Ned.

391
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,960
Your sister is hot. Red hot.

392
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,040
Which one are you?
Veronica.

393
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,480
Wow, that's really quite a set.

394
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,720
George is a tit man. I promised I'd go
up two sizes if he bought me a ring.

395
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,233
See? Bling-bling.

396
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,600
It's good because if it doesn't
work out, I can sell it.

397
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,636
If what doesn't work out?

398
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,789
Us.

399
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh.

400
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,440
What? He's got his charms.

401
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,040
You still there

402
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Like that!

403
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,160
That's Mum's ring.
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

404
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,600
Do you remember her at all?
Nuh, not much.

405
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,920
I remember one time in the kitchen,
she had a head scarf on.

406
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,040
She was trying to get me to help make
the Christmas cake and I wouldn't

407
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,237
'cause I was so mad at her
for losing all her beautiful hair.

408
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,560
You're a lot like her.
Yeah?

409
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,320
Anyway, I reckon it's my turn
to piss off for a while.

410
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,600
Here, it's all written down.

411
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,880
Where are you going?
I've got to go take care of a few things.

412
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,236
Bullshit. You're joking?
He's all yours, Ned.

413
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,320
Oh, come on.
I'm not a nurse.

414
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,788
I'll probably end up killing him.
Well, we'll see, won't we?

415
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
Come on, it's easy. Just watch the salt.

416
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,800
Keep his head above his shoulders,
otherwise he'll drown.

417
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,190
Don't look so tragic.
It'll only be a few days.

418
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,795
I'm not gonna wipe his arse.

419
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,312
Yeah, you'd leave that to Toni!

420
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,638
There you are.

421
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,200
Go away, Toni.

422
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,840
No, I don't think so.

423
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,520
You're the one who dragged me here.
Now you have to entertain me.

424
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,680
Look, if you've got nothing better to do,
you can go check on Bruce.

425
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,720
No bloody way.
He's not my father, and he stinks.

426
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,554
You come from a stinky,
stinky family, Neddy.

427
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,440
What are you doing here?
Just making some notes.

428
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,800
Jotting some stuff down.
A bit like a diary.

429
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,080
Oh. Well, I hope you noted
the great head that you...

430
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,560
Oh, you didn't get it last night.
No, I didn't actually.

431
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,039
Yeah.

432
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,160
What's this?

433
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,840
Oh, School of the Air satellites.
We're the red flag.

434
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,560
Didn't you go away to school?
Nope.

435
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,600
Why not?

436
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,955
Bruce thought he knew better
than anyone else.

437
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,120
You know, I am trying to write.

438
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,033
I don't know why you bother.
No-one reads anymore.

439
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,550
Is that so?
Uh-huh.

440
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,438
We do far more interesting things now.

441
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,355
Oh, yeah. Like what?

442
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,398
I dunno. You're supposed to be
the one with the imagination.

443
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,680
Oh, yeah.

444
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,398
Ohhh, yeah.

445
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,600
Is this what you had in mind?
Uh-huh. Sure.

446
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,920
Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,640
Fuck me.

448
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,154
Fuck me, Ned!
Shh.

449
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,593
Harder, Ned!

450
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,431
Shut up or I'll stop.
Uh-huh. OK.

451
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,633
Mmm.

452
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,960
Oh, yeah.

453
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,800
Harder, Ned. Harder!

454
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,960
What?
You sound like a fuckin' tart.

455
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,838
That's because
you fuck me like one, you shit.

456
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,080
How come you never look at me?
What?

457
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,600
How come you never look at my face
when we fuck?

458
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,511
I love looking at you.
You're beautiful.

459
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,552
Do you love me?
I'm marrying you, aren't l?

460
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,110
You're such a shit.
What kind of answer is that?

461
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,040
Toni. Toni, Toni, Toni.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

462
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,793
Come here. Look at me.
Look at me.

463
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,239
Look at me.

464
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,679
Course I love you.

465
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,160
You silly old cow, I love you.

466
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,072
Do you promise?
Yes.

467
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,839
Cross my heart...

468
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,190
..and hope to die.

469
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,360
I'm sorry, it's...

470
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,749
It's just this fuckin' place, Toni.

471
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,160
Ned!

472
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,513
Ned!

473
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,517
What are you doing?

474
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,280
I need help, you stupid girl.

475
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,640
Hey, say 'please'.

476
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,800
Please get Ned.

477
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,119
No, Ned's out.

478
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,558
Have you pissed your pants?

479
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,152
Yuck.

480
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,272
Come on. Put your arms up.

481
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,000
OK, I'm gonna pull you up.
One, two, three!

482
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,080
OK, one, two...

483
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,040
Oh! Oh!

484
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
Yeah, I've got you,
I've got you.

485
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,000
Jesus.

486
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,320
Oh, cramps!
Terrible... ah... terrible cramps.

487
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,280
Well, you should have
taken your pills.

488
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,759
Oh... Oh!

489
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,640
OK, and up.
Ohhh!

490
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,312
And up. There we go.

491
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,800
There we go.

492
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,230
Where are your PJs kept?
What?

493
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,640
Aargh!

494
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,596
Yeah, I know.

495
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,000
One foot in.

496
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,790
Oh. Oh.

497
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,157
I can smell burning.

498
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,920
Oh, it's just Ned burning the junk.
Junk?

499
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,560
All that junk in the work shed.

500
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,480
What the fuck
does he think he's doing?

501
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,711
I'm not dead yet.
That's my fuckin' junk.

502
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,440
I don't understand it.
What?

503
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,520
Why such a pretty girl would waste
her time kicking round the dust

504
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,880
with some loser
who's nearly twice her age.

505
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,680
Oh, well, maybe I have a weakness
for older men.

506
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,080
Wasted.

507
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,548
Girl like you should be
in Hollywood.

508
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,110
You reckon?
Without a doubt.

509
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,560
That's exactly what I've been
saving for -- go to Hollywood.

510
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,320
I've been taking classes.
Good girl.

511
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,788
Don't you wait too long.

512
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,949
Youth is beauty and beauty is youth.

513
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,233
And that's all you need to know.

514
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,120
I want to sleep with you.

515
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,035
I want to sleep
in your dirty, filthy man's sheets.

516
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,840
In the morning,

517
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,435
I'm gonna wake up and leave
while he's still asleep.

518
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,589
I'm gonna walk out
and never see him again.

519
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,792
Right now, I wanna dance.

520
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,000
Paula, dance with me.

521
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,152
Do it again.
That was very good.

522
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,800
Get out, you perv! Get out!
Kate, I didn't know you were in there.

523
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,392
Well, frickin' know next time!

524
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,913
Sorry, Kate, I didn't know
you were in there.

525
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,638
It's not fair.

526
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,120
Something so cute could grow up
to be just another ugly old cow.

527
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,280
Bulls don't think they're ugly.
Well, they are. Old is ugly.

528
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,918
You're getting old, Kate.

529
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,076
We all are.
Good.

530
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,960
What's so good about it?

531
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,440
I liked it better before.
Before what?

532
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,873
I dunno.

533
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,676
When we were kids, I suppose.

534
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,031
Tickle?

535
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,800
Have you got a cold?

536
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,758
No, I just like the smell.

537
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,598
It reminds me of Mum.

538
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,350
Kate, are you crying?

539
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,400
Kate, don't cry. It's alright.

540
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,080
I miss her.
It's alright. Don't cry.

541
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,990
Oh, my God, Kate. I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to. Oh!

542
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,871
Bruce?

543
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,518
Room service.

544
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,832
Toni?

545
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,480
"There the evidence was,

546
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,080
"as hot and sticky and shocking to me
as it was to Kate.

547
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,680
"She turned to me with disbelief
as her hand touched the semen

548
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,880
"and brought it up,
viscous and dangling,

549
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,836
"for her eyes to see."

550
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,960
Did you try and fuck her, did you, Ned?
Fuck your sister?

551
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,960
Don't be ridiculous. It's fiction.

552
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,600
"Then she got up slowly

553
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,240
"as though she had been lying with
a beast she feared to rouse again."

554
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,160
Give it to me.
Fucking sounds like you tried!

555
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,639
Give it to me.

556
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,280
I'm sorry, Toni. I'm sorry.

557
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,000
Stay away from me, Ned.
You fuckin' pervert!

558
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,514
Fuckin' had it with you sickos.

559
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,920
I know you're in there.

560
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,600
You can't stay there forever.

561
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,480
Kate, this morning, it wasn't you.
It was...

562
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,960
I don't want to talk about it.

563
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,320
It was my fault, OK?
Just pretend it never happened.

564
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,311
Come here.

565
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,280
Closer.

566
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,236
Kiss and make up?

567
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,033
Whoo!

568
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,439
Ahh!

569
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,439
Toni?

570
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,753
Toni! Toni!

571
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,440
What did you do? Huh? Did you pay
the blacks to come and get her?

572
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,040
What money have I got left to give
anyone? She just got your number.

573
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,280
You're a fuckin' liar, Bruce.
They all do. I did you a favour.

574
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,354
You're a liar and a bully.
You killed Cliff and you're still at it!

575
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,960
Why don't you fuckin' hurry up and die

576
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,960
before I kill you myself
just for the pleasure of it?

577
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,160
Stop, you bastards!

578
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,151
Fuckin' stop!

579
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,473
Pull over!

580
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,389
Pull over! I'm not fuckin' joking!

581
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,312
I'm still here!

582
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,557
I'm still here!

583
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,360
You hear me?!

584
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,759
Still here!

585
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,311
Neddy?

586
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,159
Neddy?

587
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,556
Ned?

588
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,032
What?
Shh.

589
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,391
'Night, Ned.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

590
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:40,198
Never let your gun
pointed be at anyone.

591
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,395
You think I've forgotten
what you said?

592
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,992
I was drunk, Bruce.

593
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,160
I was drunk.
I could hardly stand up.

594
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,073
Come on, Bruce.

595
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,200
Cliff accidentally
killed his sister.

596
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,960
He blamed himself.
He punished himself.

597
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,598
It's the end of the story.

598
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,349
I'm not a good drunk.

599
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,358
I'm sorry.

600
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,871
Come on, mate.

601
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,800
Take your pills.

602
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,678
Get me out of this mess.

603
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,231
How does it feel to be drunk?

604
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,880
Liberating.

605
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,520
I've never been drunk in my whole life.
Never liked the feeling.

606
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,999
Well, I seem to.

607
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,874
Yes, you always did, didn't you?

608
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,956
Piss off, you mongrels!

609
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,631
There you are.
I thought you'd drowned.

610
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,000
What are you doing here?
What does it look like?

611
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,800
Go home, Kate. I'm drunk.
I don't want you here.

612
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,030
Tough. It's my dam too.

613
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,118
Boo!

614
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,400
Remember at the rodeo
with Tamara and you

615
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,914
and you wanted to cop a feel?

616
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,160
Well, I wouldn't care
if I never even kissed a boy.

617
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,593
So?

618
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,994
Well, that's not normal, is it?

619
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,720
That's what I was doing
in the bathroom when you broke in,

620
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,360
wondering if I'd ever be normal.

621
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,157
I didn't break in. The door was unlocked.

622
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,720
Well, anyway, when we were on the bed
like that...

623
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,597
I know, Kate. I was there.

624
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,360
What happened?

625
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,555
Don't.

626
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,399
It's OK, Ned.

627
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,752
It made me feel better.

628
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,920
For the first time in my life,
I didn't feel like a freak.

629
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,559
I thought you didn't want
to talk about it.

630
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,556
Fine, then.
I won't mention it ever again.

631
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,192
You can touch them, Neddy.

632
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,112
It'll be our secret.

633
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,680
Oh, God.

634
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,000
Oh, God, Kate. I'm sorry.

635
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,594
It's OK, Ned. I'm OK.

636
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,680
¶ If you're happy
and you know it, clap your hands

637
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,195
¶ If you're happy and you know it,
clap your hands

638
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,476
¶ If you're happy and you know it

639
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,800
¶ And you really want to show it

640
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,439
¶ If you're happy and you know it,
clap your hands. ¶

641
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,590
It's OK, Neddy.
Just pretend I'm someone else.

642
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,760
Oh, God, oh, God.

643
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,040
Ned!

644
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,871
Ned!

645
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,316
Ned!
Here.

646
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,400
Not a day goes by I don't...

647
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,960
..see her face all bloodied like that.

648
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,920
In my mind I hear her too.

649
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,320
And it's you she's calling for --

650
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,198
you and sometimes Cliff, never me.

651
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,759
I'll get your breakfast.

652
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,040
Do you hear her, Ned?

653
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:41,320
You know how you hear, like,
twins are connected?

654
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,791
Do you? Do you ever hear her?

655
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,716
No. Never.

656
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,280
Glad you could join us, Ned.
I'm not hungry.

657
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,396
Well, you can sit
until we're finished.

658
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,360
If you give us a couple
of weeks away, Bruce,

659
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,320
I'll re-stump the posts on the Fraser
boundary where the sheep get through.

660
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,992
Get it done before Christmas.

661
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,958
You hear that, Cliff?

662
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,840
At least one of my sons is prepared
to put a bit of hard work in on the farm.

663
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,800
I said I'll quit the roadhouse and I will.

664
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,998
Sure you will, after frettin' and fussin'
about it like some pathetic old woman.

665
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,440
I don't care what time you finish. I want
you back inside these doors by 12:00!

666
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,480
Sit down!

667
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,994
Come on, Sally.
Stop playing with your food.

668
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,640
Sally, pass us the water.

669
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,279
Oh!

670
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,440
Oh, Jesus.

671
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,989
Bruce, Jesus.
Get up, get up, get up.

672
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,640
What are you doing?

673
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,560
What are you doing,
you silly old bugger?

674
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,636
Come here, OK. I got you.

675
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,994
I don't know what Sally was thinking,
leaving me with you.

676
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,993
Right.

677
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,800
You're gonna eat something
or I'm packing my bags and going.

678
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:05,271
I wouldn't miss you,
not for a bit.

679
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,513
I want salt.
You can't have any.

680
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,240
Come on, Bruce.

681
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,869
Please, just eat something.
Just a little bit.

682
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,800
There you go,
there you go. That's good.

683
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,279
That's good.

684
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,112
Thank you.

685
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,590
OK.

686
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,600
Alright.

687
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,390
Well, we'll try a bit of juice, then,
shall we?

688
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,440
Come on.

689
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,640
Bruce, you've gotta get
something into you.

690
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,835
Just drink.

691
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,993
Where's Cliff?

692
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,120
He got home from the roadhouse
10 minutes late

693
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,712
and the bastard grounded him.

694
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,957
I brought your stupid posts.

695
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,792
Thanks. I'll walk back.

696
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,270
Nicked 'em from Bruce.
Do you want one?

697
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,760
Cliff'll will be home tonight.

698
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,360
Good for him.

699
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,400
Do you wanna come back
for a swim later?

700
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,320
Just the three of us, like old times?
I don't think so.

701
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,120
Well, you needn't be frightened.

702
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,080
Cliff will be there.
He'll protect widdle Neddy.

703
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,120
Jeez, Kate, how can you joke about it?

704
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,960
God, sometimes I think
you're from outer space.

705
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,760
Well, I guess I thought you were
different from the herd, Ned.

706
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,796
Not so fuckin' timid!

707
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,478
Don't bother coming back!
You won't be missed!

708
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,800
Aren't you going
to the Christmas party?

709
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,200
Nup.
Good.

710
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,872
We'll have our own party.

711
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,560
You can play Rudolph.

712
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,040
¶ Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way

713
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,520
¶ Oh, what fun... ¶

714
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,511
Cliff wants to see you.

715
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,078
Why?

716
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,958
Hold these for Rudolph.

717
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,233
There we go.

718
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,080
He's waiting in there for you.

719
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,520
You told him?

720
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,274
He said he's waiting for you.
Why? Why did you tell him?

721
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,550
I'm asking you why!

722
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,953
Yeah, what?

723
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,680
Kate told me what you tried, Ned.
What?

724
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,600
That you tried to cop a feel.

725
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,388
Hey, Jesus, Ned.
What has happened to you, mate?

726
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,040
What are you gonna do
about it, huh? Huh?

727
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,840
Come on. Hit me. Hit me. Come on.

728
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,360
Hey, take it easy, mate. It's OK.
No, it's not OK. Come on. Hit me.

729
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,960
Hit me, come on!

730
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,240
Get off me, Ned.
You little friggin' girl. Fight me.

731
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,280
Bruce! Bruce!

732
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,480
Let go, Ned!

733
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,440
Fight me!

734
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,556
Come on. Fight me.

735
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,000
Break it up! Let go of him, Cliff.

736
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,640
Stop. It was Ned's fault.
- I don't care whose fault it is.

737
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,200
I won't have any fighting.
You hear me, Cliff? Get up.

738
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,633
You hear me?!

739
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,840
Now, you! You go
and get yourself cleaned up.

740
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,040
You're taking your sister
to the Christmas party.

741
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,200
I don't want to go.
You'll do as you're told. You'll go.

742
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,873
And you'll bring her back
when she's had enough.

743
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,200
Where's Sally?

744
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,679
She'll be back today.

745
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,672
Yeah.
Oh.

746
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,750
I suppose you'll be off then.

747
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,432
Want to finish writing my story.
Oh, yes, the magnum opus.

748
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,552
No, more of a record.

749
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,474
A record of what?

750
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,795
Finished?

751
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,514
I can imagine
what you're saying about me.

752
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,392
Buzz if you need me.

753
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,800
Alright. Here?

754
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,631
I'll tell you when.

755
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,952
Here.

756
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,518
Round a bit.

757
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:09,356
I know you children never cared
for me, especially you and Kate.

758
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,240
You're wrong, Bruce.

759
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,600
Like that -- calling me 'Bruce'.

760
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,309
You never called your mother 'Emily',
did you?

761
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,836
You're making it worse, Bruce.

762
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,952
When your mother died...

763
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,680
..I wanted to fill her place,

764
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,036
get close to you like she did.

765
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,712
But I didn't know how.

766
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:51,518
I thought my world would be in politics
but that didn't pan out.

767
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,957
But what could I do? Teach?

768
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,399
Not your father. Too proud.

769
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,200
You know what, Bruce?

770
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,112
I don't think that many people feel
like they've lived successful lives.

771
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,753
I know you blame me
for Cliff's suicide.

772
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,635
I thought I was helping him.

773
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:29,831
I thought it was going to be
a tougher world for Cliff...

774
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,755
..than it was for you and Kate.

775
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,072
I'm done.

776
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,240
Come on.

777
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,879
Let's get back to your record.

778
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,680
Thank you.
And here's one for the ladies.

779
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,596
¶ Maybe I didn't love you

780
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,789
¶ Quite as often as I could have

781
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,910
¶ Maybe I didn't treat you

782
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,951
¶ Quite as good as I should have

783
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,795
¶ If I made you feel second best

784
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,270
¶ Girl, I'm sorry, I was blind

785
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,955
¶ You were always on my mind

786
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,760
¶ You were always on my mind... ¶
- Sorry.

787
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,920
I don't want to stay here anymore.
I wanna leave. Will you take me?

788
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,680
I'm not ready to go home yet, Kate.

789
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,360
I didn't say 'home'.
What?

790
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,396
I didn't say 'home'.

791
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,353
The answer's no, Kate.

792
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,560
You have to. Bruce said
you had to look after me.

793
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,393
Well, can you just
take me home, then?

794
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,193
Come on. Let's go.

795
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,792
Will she be alright?

796
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,760
Sure. Cliff will look after her.
I'm looking after you.

797
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,672
¶ I just never took the time

798
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,356
¶ You were always on my mind

799
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,352
¶ You were always on my mind

800
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,280
¶ Tell me... ¶

801
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,157
Come on, let's go.

802
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,640
Ohhh!

803
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,520
Ohhhh!

804
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,000
Happy now, Neddy?

805
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,720
¶ Don't need lots
of people to tell me what to do

806
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:20,040
¶ Don't need long-haired ladies
to love me true as true

807
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,320
¶ All I need is a rock'n'roll band

808
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,120
¶ Somewhere to play... ¶

809
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,678
Cliff?

810
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,033
Hey, Cliff?

811
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,199
Oh, God.

812
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,591
Oh...

813
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,840
Oh, Kate.

814
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,319
Cliff!

815
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,800
Oh, God. Cliff!

816
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,720
Cliff!

817
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,040
Cliff!

818
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,720
Bitsie.

819
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,280
Here, let me take that.

820
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,080
Trip OK?
Oh, thanks.

821
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,116
Yeah, no -- good, good, good.

822
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,880
So, did you kill him yet?

823
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,313
Almost.
Hmm?

824
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,360
Hardly touched a thing.

825
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,080
How did he eat for you?

826
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,718
Oh, not much.

827
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,315
Hmm.

828
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,080
He loves his custard.
Maybe I'll get some of this into him, eh?

829
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,559
Sure.

830
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,591
Did you get what you wanted, Ned?

831
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,800
Yeah. Got some books.

832
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,039
Oh, good.

833
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,874
Good. I'm glad you got
what you wanted.

834
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,596
Sorry about Toni.
Liar.

835
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,880
Hey, Sal? Sal...
Hmm?

836
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,000
Here, let me take it in to him.

837
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,200
I'm going in the morning,
I'll say goodbye to him.

838
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,760
Ned?
Yep.

839
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,120
You won't make it any worse, will you?
No.

840
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,560
You won't tell him about you and Kate?
What?

841
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,240
About what happened
between you and Kate.

842
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,360
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do.

843
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,750
Remember that night you came home
with a big cut on your head?

844
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,840
What did we have for dinner?

845
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,520
It was yabbies.

846
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,195
I remember 'cause
I had to go get them from the dam.

847
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,917
I must have been --
what was I -- 10, 11?

848
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,078
I thought you were hurting her.

849
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,591
Stop looking at me.

850
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,640
Don't touch me.

851
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,949
I forgave you, Ned, a long time ago.

852
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,071
How could you? How?

853
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,400
You wanna know something?

854
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,312
I don't reckon Cliff
was any better than you.

855
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,796
He was just more remorseful.

856
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,550
Mmm.

857
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,919
Did you know the clock
stopped on impact?

858
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,680
Nobody could figure out why it took them
so long to get home from the dance.

859
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,990
Bruce nearly drove himself crazy,
trying to put all the pieces together.

860
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,719
Took me a long time
to figure it out as well.

861
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,872
See, I reckon Cliff could have lived
with himself for killing her.

862
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,589
It was the other stuff
he couldn't live with.

863
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,880
You think...
you think Cliff and Kate...

864
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,520
What do you reckon
they were doing out there? Really?

865
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,476
You reckon they were
fuckin' stargazing?

866
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,920
What are you doing, Ned?
What are you gonna say, Ned?

867
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,080
What? That he failed again?

868
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,072
That his greatest achievement
was just a messed-up little girl?

869
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,915
Ned, please don't!

870
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,353
Bruce?

871
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,759
Bruce?

872
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,475
Ohh...

873
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:03,030
You want to know what I remember
about that last summer?

874
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:11,680
I remember the Christmas party
and not wanting to go

875
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,040
and you telling me that I had to go,
that I had to take care of my sister

876
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,360
to bring her home
when she wanted to leave.

877
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,680
But I wouldn't. I didn't.

878
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,398
You want to know why?

879
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,754
You remember Tamara
from the roadhouse?

880
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,034
It's just like you said.

881
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,038
It's my weakness.

882
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,311
So you're off the hook, old man.

883
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,352
Much as I wanted to nail you
for Cliff's suicide...

884
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,198
..I can't make it stick.

885
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,280
If anything, you should've been
tougher on him,

886
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,840
you should have squeezed every
last drop of goodness out of him

887
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,600
and then maybe he would have
put himself first just for once.

888
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,160
Maybe he would have said,
"No, Kate, I'm not taking you home.

889
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,480
"I'm not going to drive you home.
I'm staying here,"

890
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,440
and then
I would have had to drive her.

891
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,477
Wouldn't l? I wouldn't have swerved
for no fuckin' roo.

892
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:26,234
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm so sorry.

893
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,912
I hated you.

894
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,877
I'm sorry, Dad.

895
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,160
Ned?

896
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,152
Ned?

897
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,480
Dad always said no two people
would give a damn

898
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,080
whether or not he lived or died
but you wait,

899
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,640
wait till word gets out.

900
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,598
Half the community's
gonna be at the door.

901
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,634
You know, I couldn't make a decision
between the blue and the green shirt.

902
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,959
What do you think?

903
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,110
I like the stripe. It's funny, isn't it?

904
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,515
Now he can't argue with me,
I can't decide.

905
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,992
I reckon the green.

906
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,915
Hmm?

907
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,275
That looks nice, doesn't it?

908
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,709
Yeah.

909
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,080
I am going now
to prepare a place for you.

910
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,360
And after I have gone
and prepared you a place,

911
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,800
I shall return to take you with me,
so that where I am, you may be too.

912
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,560
This is the Gospel of the Lord. Amen.

913
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,198
Amen.

914
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,792
Ned.

915
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,951
I want to show you something.

916
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,358
Won't you be lonely?

917
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,000
I've got 20 kids here call me 'auntie'.

918
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,080
I don't reckon I can get that lonely.

919
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,280
It's funny, you know.

920
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,800
A man can live his whole life

921
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,634
and never cop
to his greatest achievement...

922
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,919
..you.

923
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:13,360
¶ There's a little bird
that somebody sent

924
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:20,680
¶ Down to the earth
to live on the wind

925
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:27,760
¶ Born on the wind
and she sleeps on the wind

926
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:35,040
¶ That little bird
that somebody sent

927
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:41,960
¶ She's light and fragile,
her feathers sky blue

928
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:50,000
¶ So thin and graceful,
the sun shines through

929
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:57,360
¶ This little bird
that lives on the wind

930
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:04,391
¶ This little bird
that somebody sent

931
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:13,920
¶ She flies so high up in the sky

932
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:20,600
¶ Out of reach of human eye

933
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:27,640
¶ And the only time
she touches the ground

934
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:31,640
¶ Is when that little bird

935
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:35,120
¶ Is when that little bird

936
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:41,070
¶ Is when that little bird dies. ¶
