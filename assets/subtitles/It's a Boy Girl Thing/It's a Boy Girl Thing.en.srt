1
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:22,998
Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die,
take him and cut him out into little stars ...

2
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:28,873
... and he'll make the face of heaven so fine. And all
the world will be in love with the night ...

3
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:37,670
... will make the face of heaven so fine that all
the world will be in love ...

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,194
... all the world will be in love with the night ...

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,919
Excuse me! Excuse me!

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,795
- Woody, will you turn that down?
- Sorry, I can't hear you!

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,798
Turn the noise down!

8
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,759
Sorry, did you say something?

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,635
I'm trying to study but it's impossible
with that racket going on!

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,515
- It's not racket, that's Mystical!
- Whatever it is, will you please switch it off?

11
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,837
- What's it worth?
- The gratitude of a music lover?

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,198
Alright, I turn it off!

13
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,155
- If you flash me. You show me what girls are all about!
- You are a pig fried!

14
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,992
- Anyway, I've seen them before
- What! You have not!

15
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,794
Have now!

16
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,630
Good morning, Mr. Fluffy.

17
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,229
- Woody, are you up yet?
- Oh, yeah!

18
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,309
- Good morning, Daddy!
- I have some mail for you, princess.

19
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,550
It's from Yale!

20
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:16,557
- I have an interview next week!
- I applied for early action for you, honey!

21
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:19,830
- My precious little girl are going to Yale.
- I have to get through the interview first, mother.

22
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:23,508
- You won't let us down, never have.
- Never has.

23
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,474
- Isn't it exciting, Ted?
- It's very excititing, Katherine.

24
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:29,431
- Are you excited?
- I am.

25
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:34,236
I'm so excited I could yell it
from the rooftops!

26
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:40,235
-Thank you, mother!

27
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,749
- Everything OK back there?
- No problem, honey.

28
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,396
- Just searing off a couple of finger prints.
- Carry on, my good woman.

29
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:56,471
- Big game's coming up soon, son?
- Yep!

30
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:01,476
- Coach says all the big college scouts gonna be at the game.
- Yeah, I know.

31
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:06,834
Speciality of the House! I call it 'Eggs What the Heck'

32
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:11,233
So much of fine cuisine is down to
presentation, don't you think, son?

33
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:13,189
Oh yeah, absolutely!

34
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:17,988
You'll be the first member of
my family to go to college.

35
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:21,712
He'll be the first member of your
family to go to freaking school!

36
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:23,709
That's true.

37
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:28,468
But son, if thing's don't work out,
there'll always be a job for you ...

38
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:31,190
... with Stan the Man at Spatula World.

39
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:42,025
To me, the greatest living American should
have individual accomplishments

40
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:46,195
but also have a lasting influcence
on America and with the world.

41
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:51,151
And that is why after careful
consideration my candidate...

42
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:02,512
- Yo, what's up boy?
- Hi, Horse!

43
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:07,791
- Nice grab, Horse! How's it hanging?
- To the floor, my friend!

44
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:10,510
What say we shift this baby into warp drive, huh?

45
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:15,070
I want you to feel the wind blowing through
the hair of your fine muscular ass!

46
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:19,433
Hit it please!

47
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:48,507
Well, looky here!

48
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,673
- Is that not a pencil necked virigin girl I see before me?
- I do believe it is.

49
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:58,234
- She's standing dangerously close to a vast pool of water.
- For a smart girl, that ain't so smart.

50
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:42,227
Thank you!

51
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,783
OK, just keep walking.

52
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,985
No one will notice.

53
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,863
Who wants cotton candy?

54
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:02,152
Hey, Nell, I love what you've
done with your hair!

55
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:04,913
Thanks, Glixen.

56
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:18,864
Three, two one...

57
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,065
Hey, watch it!

58
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,511
- Harry!
- What's up baby!

59
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,350
Wow wow, people around!

60
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,749
Nice look!

61
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:39,745
Special needs boy and his muse,
the lovely Clamydia.

62
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:41,624
My name's Breanna, you geek!

63
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:46,507
By the way, sorry about this morning. That
puddle just... showed up in front of us!

64
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:49,943
Oh, that's OK, please don't
apologize it, I understand.

65
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:57,506
While archetypal outsiders such as myself
rarely fit comfortably into high school environements

66
00:07:57,712 --> 00:08:00,908
this is as good as your life will get.

67
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,740
- The big football star and his vacuous cheerleader girlfriend...
- Head cheerleader.

68
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:11,426
Because, let's face it. The old gray matter
ain't exactly top level, is it Woodster?

69
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:15,067
So you end up with a job in Spatula World with your dad

70
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,626
and probably marry Breanna here.

71
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,710
But soon you start drinking to numb
this aching feeling you have inside.

72
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:26,541
Fast forward a few years and you're a drunk
fat guy at a bar talking about the good old days.

73
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:30,426
While your little wife whose
looks have gone to the dodo

74
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:37,025
is prepping up her self esteem with squalid
sexual encounters with your friends behind your back.

75
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,463
- What friends?
- I'm guessing most of them.

76
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,349
Have a good day.

77
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,544
Class, please turn to page 488. Paragraph
demarked 'Early history'

78
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,220
which reads: 'Combined with the study of mankind

79
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,740
in all its aspects, especially human culture

80
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,788
we are therefore examining that society through
the exploration of classical structure.'

81
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,339
Now, do not forget to make full use
of your abstract database.

82
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,340
And class, please make sure the references of
the source material include the internet.

83
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,218
That's OK for now but

84
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,342
you might want to omit that
page from your reference list.

85
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:31,019
Now, Mr. Zbornak will be taking your field trip this week.

86
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,419
I tried on the most amazing dress for the dance.

87
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:41,259
Think Beyonce's wow-factor meets Gwen
Stefani's outfit of individuality

88
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:43,903
with just a sprinkling of designer slut Aguilera.

89
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:47,465
The whole thing's very Madonna before
she got old naturally.

90
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,227
Sounds hot!

91
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:53,463
Now, I think Armani would be good for you.
Stylish yet understated

92
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,388
so you look good but you don't
distract attention from me.

93
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:01,667
- Mr Deanne! If it's not too much trouble?
- OK, just a minute!

94
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,820
Take a look at this odd looking fella!

95
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:14,062
Texcatlipoca

96
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:18,944
the ancient Aztek god of sorcery. Associated
with the notion of destiny.

97
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,582
Tex here has an interesting resume:

98
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,098
He was the god of night,
lord of the smoking mirror.

99
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:27,783
A shape shifter

100
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:30,578
a powerful SOB.

101
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:34,867
Mr Deanne, do you think I might
have your attention?

102
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:38,897
Or does Mr. Horson have something
particularly interesting to say?

103
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,986
I'm betting on unlikely.

104
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,783
OK, time is short, people. I want you to
pair off and take in the rest yourselves.

105
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:50,217
Remember: research

106
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:51,780
analyze and...

107
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:53,056
...describe!

108
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,746
Very nice.

109
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:03,143
Mr Horson, you go with Glixen.
Mr Deanne, you go with Miss Bedworth.

110
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:07,377
Let's get your learn on.

111
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:11,576
So, checked out any good porno sites lately?

112
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:15,746
I cannot believe I'm stuck with you. Let's
hope I don't breathe in any retard germs.

113
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:19,986
- Let's hope I don't get any pencil neck virgin disease.
- Get stuffed.

114
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:24,182
- I hate you!
- It's because you secretly want to have sex with me!

115
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:27,257
When I do decide to surrender
the flower of my womanhood

116
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,662
I've always imagined it to be with
someone of my own species!

117
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,664
There's is nobody else in your
species, except maybe Glixen.

118
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:37,417
You're such a moron. You really think
the world evolves around rap music, football
and hanging out with the right crowd?

119
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:40,743
You know, you make me sick, you think
you are so different to everyone else.

120
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,504
Different from.

121
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,823
You said 'Different to'. The correct
phraseology is 'Different from'.

122
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:50,497
Thanks for that information. You're no different
from any other geek with books instead of friends

123
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:52,936
and you don't have to open
your big fat mouth to correct me.

124
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,023
- Neanderthal!
- Spaz.

125
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,101
- I should pity you but I can't.
- I hate you too much.

126
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:01,901
I rather cross my legs for the rest of the night
for everybody than to be anything like you!

127
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:05,860
- Dito!
- 'Dito'?

128
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:07,941
Double dito!

129
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,819
Double double dito times a thousand trillions!

130
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:39,300
'... and forever more shall find her destiny to live alone no more.'

131
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,495
Good night, Mr. Fluffy.

132
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:29,341
Oh God, my head...

133
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,574
I must be dreaming. Time to wake up.

134
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:34,743
What was that?

135
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:37,017
Tits!

136
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:40,181
I have tits. Two tits!

137
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:44,662
This is the regular number of tits
but for a guy? What's going on here?

138
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:47,655
Oh my god, it's gone!

139
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,540
This looks bad. If it's gone and I have tits

140
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:57,491
that means this must be a dream.

141
00:13:57,863 --> 00:14:00,980
A very very bad "Now I have tits" dream.

142
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,572
What is this?

143
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:11,302
This isn't my room!

144
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,661
We need to talk!

145
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,815
Talk? She want's to talk?

146
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:30,100
Let's talk about why I'm going through a drawer
full of underwear with the days of the week on them.!

147
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,854
Oh God!

148
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,420
OK, now my pubes knows it Wednesday!

149
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:49,051
It's tough enough getting
these damn things off!

150
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,173
How the hell does anyone get these things on?

151
00:14:58,142 --> 00:15:01,656
Ladies, looks like you and me is going au naturelle.

152
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,735
Go away!

153
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:09,218
Alright, coast is clear.

154
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,459
Get off.

155
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,093
Good morning!

156
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:34,251
- Nell, is everything OK?
- I didn't see you there!

157
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,974
- Your oatmel is on the table.
- I'm in a hurry , gotta go.

158
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:42,299
Nonsense, now you sit down, it's
the most important meal of the day.

159
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,698
And oatmel is wonderful for promoting
healthy and regular bowel movements.

160
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,653
That's cool if I want to take
a dump the size of my head.

161
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,935
Excuse me?

162
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,132
Oatmeal's good, mummy.

163
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,731
Is this meat?

164
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,451
- You have oatmeal?
- Are you shitting me?

165
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,658
Porkmeat's good.
Eat up, son

166
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,929
Jesus, I'm gonna puke.

167
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,288
Golly, you must have been hungry.

168
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,296
You need a second helping. You wait there, young lady!

169
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,970
How's it going, pretty boy?

170
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,213
Let's go!

171
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,130
It will turn you into a big strong girl!

172
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,015
Excuse me.

173
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,257
See you later.

174
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,814
Nell, aren't you forgetting something?

175
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:23,088
Holy crap, look at the size of that thing!

176
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,010
What thing?

177
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,448
Gotta go mom, see you later.

178
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,615
Hop in man, we got places to go,
people to see, women to impregnate.

179
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:49,653
You OK?

180
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,171
Yeah, I'm fine!

181
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:54,690
Really?

182
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:15,097
The bitch stole my ride!

183
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:25,688
- We're going a little fast?
- You bet your sweet ass we are!

184
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:28,334
I am going to die!

185
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:37,570
Oh God, I'm getting on the bus. I haven't
been on the bus since 8th grade!

186
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,048
Come on!

187
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,686
Screw you assholes!

188
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,890
That's no way for a young lady to talk!

189
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:04,850
Sorry, I'm a bitch when I'm on
the rag, you know what I'm saying?

190
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,495
- Sorry!
- Yeah, you too.

191
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:21,769
And this dress is just amazing

192
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:25,134
You!

193
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:29,249
- What the hell have you done to me, witch lady?
- Get your hands off me, you bully!

194
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:33,653
- God, you think I'm responsible for this?
- I certainly am not. And you're the one who knows everything.

195
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:36,409
That does not include this!

196
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:41,370
This is impossible.
This can not happen!

197
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:47,810
- You better figure out how to get my damn body back.
- Trust me, there's nothing I would like more.

198
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:50,768
You think I relish waking up
another day with the Simpsons?

199
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:55,412
- Leave my parents out of this.
- And what is up with your mother? She never heard of volume control?

200
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:58,686
Yak farmers in Tibet are praying
for her to keep the volume down.

201
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:00,646
And her language, my goodness!

202
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:03,971
My mother does not have a mole
on her face the size of the White House.

203
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:08,008
So she's got a problem with moles. Besides,
it's not a mole, it's a beauty spot!

204
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:11,729
I can spot that beauty all the way from Wisconsin!

205
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,490
Insensitive pig!

206
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:18,927
I don't want to be a boy, OK?
Especially I don't want to be you!

207
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:23,730
No, no, no, don't cry, not here.

208
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:29,009
Maybe it's just one of those 24
hour things. Like a head cold.

209
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:33,568
Tomorrow we could be back to normal.

210
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,686
Just try not to attract any unnecessary attention.

211
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,733
Gross, I have to touch it? Ewww!

212
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:03,812
I will never eat finger food from a
buffet again for as long as I live.

213
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:14,651
Your homework was to prepare a
speech on the greatest living American.

214
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:21,290
I'm sorry I missed it but I was excused
from homework due to cheerleading practice.

215
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:22,880
I see. And Nell?

216
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,367
What?

217
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:31,848
Your speech please. On the
greatest living American?

218
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:45,129
I think the greatest living American is...

219
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:49,891
...J-Lo.

220
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,604
- J-Lo?
- You know, Jennifer Lopez?

221
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:59,648
Singer, movie star. She had a thing
with that dude from 'Pearl Harbor'.

222
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,127
I know who J-Lo is now.

223
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:08,725
I am just very interested to hear what you
perceive qualifies her for such a unique accolade.

224
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:13,129
The thing about J-Lo is that...

225
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,128
...she's from the streets..

226
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:20,607
And now she's like this big movie
star and... she's still really cool.

227
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:24,483
She used to have a little,
now she's got a lot.

228
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:28,923
But she's still J-Lo from the block.
And I think that's pretty damn great.

229
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:35,006
And she's American.
And she's alive.

230
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,890
I see.

231
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,363
J-Lo?

232
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:49,485
Pretty good, huh? It just
flew right into my head.

233
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,520
At least there's plenty
of space for it to land.

234
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,805
What is your problem? I happen to
like J-Lo! She's a hot booty!

235
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,640
You do not bestow an honor such as 'Greatest
Living American' solely on the fact of a hot booty!

236
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,923
I didn't! She also happen to
have a terrific set of funbags!

237
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,524
Woody Deanne, you're
an idiot and a Philistine.

238
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,279
Know what, I don't appreciate
you calling me an idiot.

239
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,926
And I don't know what that other thing is
but as sure as hell ain't one of them either.

240
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,798
Hey Woody!

241
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,045
What a lovely sight. Swill time at Getty Central.

242
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,959
Dear God, now I have to eat
with these creatures?

243
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:48,803
My parents are going out tonight, maybe you
wanna come over to discuss what you wanna wear
for the homecoming dance?

244
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,204
I have things to do.

245
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:55,448
What I meant was: we'd be alone.

246
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,603
So maybe I might do that thing when I...

247
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:08,243
- You filthy little slut!
- You do that?

248
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:13,560
Last week he begged me to do that!

249
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:19,361
- So what is it, what do you do?
- Get lost, you little spastic.

250
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:25,843
I can not believe Woody turned down
the chance to have sex with me tonight!

251
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:28,443
Am I in like bizarro world?

252
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:33,318
If I had Richard Wainwright sniffing around me,
I wouldn't waste my time on Woody.

253
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:34,802
It's not that simple Tiffany.

254
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:38,444
Today football captain,
tomorrow GQ Man of the Year.

255
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:41,725
You need to plan these things!

256
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:46,638
Personally I'd be relived if Horse and
I didn't have sex. Sometimes I think it's
the only reason he's with me.

257
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,081
- That is so not true Chanel. You have many fine qualities.
- Really? Like what?

258
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:55,917
You have excellent taste in earrings.

259
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:59,520
And your hair looks really good.

260
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,801
And you're friends with me. Case closed.

261
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,641
- Woodster! Come on in, my man.
- How are you?

262
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:19,361
Cool as frozen shit, homie.

263
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,435
Yo, we have extra practice tonight,
alright, don't forget!

264
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,802
I'm in the mood to kick some serious ass!

265
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:28,406
Oh yeah, me too!

266
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:34,443
...only I have a prior engagement that
conflicts with the whole ass kicking thing.

267
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,916
Wait, we're a week away
from the game against Lamont.

268
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:40,562
Do you know what the coach will do to
your nuts if you don't show up tonight?

269
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:44,600
No, I'll tell you. He will grind them into dust.

270
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:46,635
Nut dust.

271
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,839
And the only kids you'd be able to have
is the itsy-bitsy patter ones.

272
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:28,644
Alright, here we go!

273
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,080
Wood?

274
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:33,637
Cut the ball, man!

275
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,559
- Woody?
- Sorry, coach.

276
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,076
Alright, let's get this.

277
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:51,960
Go!

278
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:58,320
- Wood man, come on!
- Wake up, boy!

279
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,353
Sorry, coach.

280
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:06,843
I got it!

281
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:17,520
What the hell were you doing out
there? You play like a damn woman!

282
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:19,203
I'm a little pique.

283
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:23,275
- It means off colour.
- I know what 'picque' means!

284
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:25,600
You listen to me, and you listen good!

285
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,922
This homecoming game is gonna be
the biggest game in those boys' lives.

286
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:34,482
You may have a god given talent but I
will not let you risk it. Do you hear me?

287
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:36,673
Yes, coach!

288
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:41,877
You get your shit together or you'll be
watching the game from the side lines!

289
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:48,801
Don't let it bug you buddy,
just hang in there!

290
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:52,634
Look, you just hit a slump,
just like a golfer.

291
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:56,472
It doesn't matter how big you are,
every now and again you lose a swing.

292
00:27:56,683 --> 00:28:00,915
So you keep working on your strokes
and banging those balls.

293
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,474
Do you wanna touch my helmet?

294
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:10,992
My lucky helmet. It works for me, maybe it'll
do you the same. Go ahead, give it a rub!

295
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:34,316
Oh man, this is crappy music!

296
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:46,517
Loser!

297
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:48,952
Yeah, you too and your mama!

298
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:56,114
I heard about football practice.

299
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:58,790
Those boys are really rough.
I'm covered in bruises.

300
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:02,551
I don't care about your bruises.
If coach drops you my life is over.

301
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:06,310
Why are you so worked up?
It's only a game!

302
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:11,317
No, it's not only a game. It's football!
Jesus, don't you get anything?

303
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:16,549
- I get that clearly this is not a head cold.
- Do you have any better theories, smart ass?

304
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:21,437
Look at you. What am I wearing?

305
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:24,195
Chinos and a Oxford cotton button-down
I found in the back of your closet.

306
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:28,280
Which is exactly where it is meant to stay!

307
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,680
Nonsense, you can't beat the classic look!

308
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:34,669
- My hair, you've made it all dorky!
- A center parting is very European looking.

309
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:39,033
- No, it is very dorky looking!
- Excuse me for taking a little pride in your appearance!

310
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:42,995
You could have ruined my life,
I look like a male version of you!

311
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:48,390
As long as I'm stuck inside this disgusting
body, you'll just have to put up with it!

312
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,351
Alright, if that's how
you want it, sweet cheeks.

313
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:41,277
Nice ass!

314
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,992
You're looking fine, sugar!

315
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,193
- What are you doing?
- Protecting your modesty. You look like a common prostitute!

316
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:52,471
- Damn, I was going for a high class hooker!
- You can not walk into school like this!

317
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,513
I can do whatever I want. Now get
your hands off me or I'll scream.

318
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:26,513
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be Shakespeare.

319
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:35,909
OK, here goes.

320
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:38,915
Nice penis.

321
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:01,555
Nothing like a bit of personal hygien.

322
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:13,712
Well, it has to be done.

323
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:18,328
Come on, think about it.

324
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,851
And she's totally pretending to be pretty.

325
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,748
- Hello, Woody.
- Hello, Breanna.

326
00:32:28,957 --> 00:32:33,269
- I have something I want to say to you.
- Let me guess: you're sorry about blowing me off.

327
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:36,555
No. I'm afraid we can't see each other any more.

328
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:40,068
Very funny, Woody.

329
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:43,234
Well, I don't find you that attractive any more.

330
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:46,594
You just look kind of plain.

331
00:32:48,156 --> 00:32:50,989
And don't worry about your moustache.
Some guys are really into that shit.

332
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:55,112
Suck on this, Woody Dean.

333
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:56,954
I can't believe he said that to her!

334
00:32:57,156 --> 00:33:00,307
You can't really see the hairs anyway.

335
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:02,311
What just happened?

336
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:05,713
Seems you and your girlfriend just broke up.
Commiserations.

337
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:10,269
No! Me and Breanna?
Breanna and I, but let's not quip over details.

338
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:14,669
- Broke up with my girlfriend?
- You'll get over it.

339
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:18,226
Wanna go for a ride?

340
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:20,751
I have to go, tonight's a big night for me.

341
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:23,667
You too.

342
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:29,314
Congratulations. Tonight's the night
you finally get to lose it.

343
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:34,628
Nicky!

344
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,989
There you go, babe.

345
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,707
Thanks.

346
00:33:55,915 --> 00:33:57,633
Nice...

347
00:33:58,515 --> 00:34:00,870
- ... trailer.
- It's a dump.

348
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:03,907
But... my folks are away...

349
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:07,865
...and we won't be disturbed.

350
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:16,704
Never seen a chick
drink like that before.

351
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,671
My throat's a little dry.

352
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,982
Maybe I could moisten it up a little.

353
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:32,383
I can't. I need another beer.

354
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,951
Sure.

355
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:47,307
- You OK?
- I'm fine thank you.

356
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:52,382
You've been acting kind of weird lately.
I think I know what's on your mind.

357
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,227
- I don't think you do.
- Let me guess.

358
00:34:56,873 --> 00:35:03,949
I think you think if you don't impress those scouts,
you're gonna end up working with your dad
in Spatula World.

359
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:05,668
What?

360
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:11,023
I ain't stupid, Woody. Just
let things fall into place.

361
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,023
Whatever you do, we'll be proud of you.

362
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:22,071
So you don't want to work
with spatulas, what the heck?

363
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:31,271
Not here.

364
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:34,262
OK, let's go to the master bedroom.

365
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:41,541
Let's get cracking baby,
cause daddy's packing!

366
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:47,469
Oh god, what was I thinking? This is so gay!

367
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,065
What are you waiting for, baby?

368
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:54,026
Daddy wants to see some flesh.

369
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:57,787
He's gonna make me his bitch!
Woody the bitch boy!

370
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,865
Maybe you need a little help?

371
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:04,391
I have to pee.

372
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:05,263
Now?

373
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:09,430
Yeah, I can feel I have to fricking go. So, you
get undressed

374
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:11,861
and don't start without me.

375
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:20,505
Hey, come back!

376
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:29,381
Not this shit again, man!

377
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:34,544
It's very melodic. If you give it a
chance you might learn to enjoy it.

378
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:39,988
No. Still shit.

379
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:42,382
Have you heard about that grease ball Nicky?

380
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:47,260
She got it on last night.

381
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,462
Did you guys hear?

382
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,828
She did it in the trailer park.

383
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,501
She probably didn't even
know it was a trailer park.

384
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,141
Woody, are you crying?

385
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,222
What's wrong?

386
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,467
I'm sorry.

387
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,306
I just found out I lost my virginity in a trailer park.

388
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:37,462
I gotta go.
I got a class.

389
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:06,978
Hey, do you think she might do it with me?

390
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,938
No! Get lost.

391
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:19,697
What?

392
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:26,387
Don't worry. You had a great time.

393
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,657
Trust me, you'll never forget it.

394
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:31,620
How could you do this to me?

395
00:38:33,348 --> 00:38:37,136
I know you're not the best looking guy in the world but it's only sex.

396
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:40,223
I wanted it to be special.

397
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:44,939
Well, you started it. 'A central
parting is very european looking'.

398
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,342
You lost me my girlfriend.

399
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:49,506
I was saving it for the boy I fell in love with.

400
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:59,862
Look, nothing happened, OK?

401
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,778
- Really?
- Really.

402
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:09,024
- That's not what Nicky is telling everyone.
- Well, Nicky is a liar.

403
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,536
Try telling that to the entire world.

404
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:16,660
How's it feel to be a cheap little slut?

405
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:24,945
Looks like I have to have a talk with that son of a bitch, cause no one
calls us the sort.

406
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:40,379
Pass the ball!

407
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:44,695
Nicky, here's your ho!

408
00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:49,779
- Hey, I'm looking for you!
- You found me, baby.

409
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:52,257
What the hell did you say?

410
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:55,181
Nothing.

411
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,305
Oh really?

412
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,574
But I wasn't 100 percent true.

413
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:04,021
You greasy scumbag liar.

414
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:07,259
And you've got a very dirty little mouth.

415
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:09,905
Then again...

416
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,504
...I already knew that.

417
00:40:14,106 --> 00:40:16,461
- A little hellcat, ain't you?
- Asshole!

418
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:21,777
That's no way to treat a lady, mister!

419
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,897
And what kind of word is 'ain't you'.
It's wrong on so many levels.

420
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:27,824
Why don't you tell everyone what really happened?

421
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,095
- Tell them!
- Nothing! Nothing happened!

422
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:35,060
I think you owe this sweet, innocent,
yet very attractive young lady an apology.

423
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,504
Sorry.

424
00:40:39,585 --> 00:40:41,177
I'm sorry!

425
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:43,454
Thanks.

426
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:52,895
It's so much fun to hit someone.
I'd like to back, punch him again.

427
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:59,177
Easy champ. Doesn't mean I forgive you
about screwing up about Breanna and I.

428
00:40:59,785 --> 00:41:01,264
Breanna and me.

429
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:04,932
I'll try to fix things.

430
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:07,863
What's the point? I'm a girl, remember?

431
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:13,103
Jesus, what am I gonna do?
Homecoming's next Friday.

432
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:15,376
My life is a complete disaster.

433
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:18,098
- What were we doing before this happened?
- Arguing?

434
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,579
- You always argue.
- Not always.

435
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:23,815
We were at the museum.

436
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:29,219
- In front of that ugly Mexican dude.
- Aztec. Texcatlipoca.

437
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:33,133
- That's the guy.
- He's the ancient god of sorcery.

438
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:45,856
We close in 5 minutes, folks.

439
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:58,015
- OK, you go first.
- No, you go first, you have the biggest mouth.

440
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:04,059
- Hi, how are you?
- Is that the best you can do?
He's a god, not your aunt Betsy.

441
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:10,140
You may have got the impression that this
young fellow and I didn't like it each other.

442
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,536
But let me tell you, that could not
be any farther from the truth.

443
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:19,100
That's right. Sure we were fighting
but all friends fight, right?

444
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:25,378
How could you not like Nell? She is
really tidy and smart, way smart!

445
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,579
Kinda cute, especially when she does that thing with her nose.

446
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,656
We get along really well.

447
00:42:33,662 --> 00:42:36,779
- Yeah, we're actually very close.
- Closest.

448
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:38,210
Real homies.

449
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,492
- To the end, bro.
- Don't overdo it.

450
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:47,171
Now that we've got that cleared up, here's what we're gonna do.

451
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:49,378
We close our eyes, count to three

452
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:52,892
and when we open them up, we'll
be back in our right bodies.

453
00:42:53,382 --> 00:42:54,781
If that's OK with you

454
00:42:54,982 --> 00:43:01,217
which I'm sure it is, since this
is just a big misunderstanding we can
laugh about in years to come.

455
00:43:02,342 --> 00:43:03,570
Let's do it.

456
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:12,290
One...

457
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:14,894
...two...

458
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:16,740
...three.

459
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,092
Maybe he only speaks Mexican?

460
00:43:27,301 --> 00:43:29,974
So what are we gonna do next,
buy him an enchilada?

461
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:33,696
I had my heart set on Yale.

462
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:36,611
No, please, not the tears, please?

463
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,129
You think I wanna end up
in my dad's spatula store?

464
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:43,093
You don't know.

465
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,735
Wait, wait!

466
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:51,058
You beat up Nicky.

467
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,932
You have my body, my strength.

468
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,893
All I need to do is show you how to use it.

469
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,651
And we could study so you
could get through my interview.
Huh?

470
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:53,294
Ready?

471
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:55,929
As hard as you like.

472
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:01,372
Come on.

473
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:19,615
Once the sign is given

474
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:23,936
the center snaps the ball to the quarterback
and the game begins. Are you with me so far?

475
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:26,851
The offence has a limited amount of time...

476
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,447
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

477
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:32,616
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

478
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:36,015
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.

479
00:45:36,218 --> 00:45:39,130
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.

480
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:45,933
So, he's not actually saying that she's like a
summer's day? He say she is hot like a summer's day?

481
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:47,969
Yeah, that's it exactly!

482
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:54,697
Right, you know, I still can't imagine ever
actually saying something like that to someone.

483
00:45:55,498 --> 00:45:57,056
Feel like so uncool.

484
00:45:57,258 --> 00:46:00,374
Maybe you'd just have to meet the right
person to say that kind of stuff to.

485
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:03,489
Or maybe I just don't wanna look like a doofus.

486
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:07,372
Well, Shaky must really have liked that
one. She must have been some babe.

487
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:09,886
Actually, Shakespeare wrote this to a young man.

488
00:46:10,457 --> 00:46:13,449
- Shakespeare was a homo?
- We don't know that exactly.

489
00:46:13,697 --> 00:46:17,212
You write a poem to a guy telling him
how hot he is and you don't know exactly?

490
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:20,056
Gees, what do you have to do
before you know exactly?

491
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:22,817
Write an ode to a schlong?

492
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:24,809
I think that's enough for today.

493
00:46:25,017 --> 00:46:27,929
The bard was a bender.
Who would've though?

494
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:29,930
See you tomorrow.

495
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:31,656
Good night.

496
00:46:38,497 --> 00:46:41,853
Listen, I was wrong about your parents. They're
alright once you get used to your mom's language.

497
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:43,887
Mom's pretty cool.

498
00:46:46,656 --> 00:46:48,533
Woody, can I ask you a question?

499
00:46:50,216 --> 00:46:51,410
Sure.

500
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:55,293
In the morning...

501
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,448
- Never mind.
- What?

502
00:46:58,656 --> 00:47:00,487
- No, it's nothing really.
- Go on.

503
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:02,607
It's a little embarrasing but...

504
00:47:02,816 --> 00:47:05,376
...every morning you...

505
00:47:07,096 --> 00:47:10,247
...have this thing....

506
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,048
- The thing that you...
- What?

507
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:17,410
You know, every morning?

508
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:23,726
- You mean the old boner.
- That's not the word I would have used.

509
00:47:23,936 --> 00:47:29,134
- Boy, do I miss that guy.
- I'm sure you do. What I'd like to know: how can I get rid of it?

510
00:47:30,495 --> 00:47:31,974
Only one way I know of.

511
00:47:33,055 --> 00:47:35,250
That's disgusting...

512
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:37,054
...and there's got to be another way, right?

513
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:42,891
Well, there is one thing that I
do in case of emergencies....

514
00:47:43,135 --> 00:47:46,093
...sort of lets the air out of the
old tire, if you know what I'm saying.

515
00:47:46,855 --> 00:47:51,406
First I close my eyes, and I think of you.

516
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:56,729
- Works every the time.
- Good night.

517
00:47:56,935 --> 00:47:58,209
See ya!

518
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:17,247
- Hey, you want one?
- No, thanks.

519
00:48:19,174 --> 00:48:23,087
You've had it quiet up there tonight. Are you OK?

520
00:48:24,254 --> 00:48:28,452
- Yeah, I was just studying with Nell.
- Is that what you young people are calling it these days?

521
00:48:28,854 --> 00:48:32,005
- Nell's not that kind of girl.
- I know.

522
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:33,813
She's a good kid.

523
00:48:34,774 --> 00:48:41,088
You know, way back, her dad Ted and I used
to hang out together. He was a good guy, Ted.

524
00:48:41,774 --> 00:48:43,093
He still is.

525
00:48:44,894 --> 00:48:46,612
I mean, as far as I know.

526
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,007
What ever happened between you two?

527
00:48:49,214 --> 00:48:54,287
Nell's mom, Katherine, I guess.
She didn't really approve.

528
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:58,969
We weren't her kind of people.

529
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,132
Good night, son.

530
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:05,601
Good night, dad.

531
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:16,484
Oh god, she's crying.

532
00:49:20,173 --> 00:49:21,572
Chanel?

533
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:24,525
Are you OK?

534
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:28,051
Oh crap...

535
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:33,051
What's wrong?

536
00:49:33,412 --> 00:49:37,291
It's about Harry. He's seeing some other girl.

537
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:40,123
No, he wouldn't do that.

538
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:44,566
Well, how come I saw him with
his tongue stuck down her throat.

539
00:49:45,972 --> 00:49:47,769
Did you see who it was?

540
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:52,802
No, they were in his car. But I
saw what they were doing clear enough.

541
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:57,404
Why are guys such jerks?

542
00:50:00,452 --> 00:50:04,968
Why am I asking you, you know less about
guys than anybody on the planet.

543
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:08,641
I'm sorry.

544
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:11,491
- I didn't mean that.
- You're right.

545
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:13,807
What do I know about guys?

546
00:50:16,131 --> 00:50:20,010
I was so stupid. I know how Horse is.

547
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:24,005
Why do you go out with them?

548
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:29,967
Cause when I started at Westdale I felt invisible.

549
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:34,528
And then I started going out
with Horse and I became friends

550
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:39,805
with Breanna and Tiffany and Woody and
everyone. And then people started to notice me.

551
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:43,281
And I liked that.

552
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:49,004
So, I guess I'm just afraid
of feeling invisible again.

553
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:55,044
You know I think that a lot more
people feel that way than you realize.

554
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:57,402
You do.

555
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,526
You go your own way no
matter what anyone thinks.

556
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,646
I admire you, Nell.

557
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:18,083
- And this is Mr. Stinky, you have to say hello.
- Why did you bring that pencil neck to our sleepover?

558
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:21,364
Nell's OK.

559
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,164
She just wants to hang, right?

560
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,009
Carey told me we're all going in our jammies.

561
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,090
I see you finally seen the
errors of your geekish ways?

562
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,679
I have. This girl just wants to have fun.

563
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,325
OK. OK! Let's get to our PJ's!

564
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:49,157
Oh man!

565
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:52,403
Life is such a bitch.

566
00:51:55,969 --> 00:52:00,121
Lock target in 5 and will you check out that ass!

567
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:01,758
What about Chanel?

568
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:05,404
No, don't see her.

569
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:07,201
Think about it Harry

570
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:12,722
are you willing to betray the love of a good
woman for the cheap thrill of a one night stand?

571
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:21,003
You crack me up, you know that boy.

572
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,881
You were always into the 'faithful' but I'm the Horse

573
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:26,443
and Horse people knows of
no such boundaries. And plus

574
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:30,766
at night I'm a locked target

575
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:36,076
You know what happens. A few drinks,
quality control goes out the window

576
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:39,917
and before you know it, you're sucking
face with some swill muncher from downtown.

577
00:52:40,128 --> 00:52:43,279
Or worse still. I end up here with you

578
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:46,082
drunk on some dark street
telling you I love you.

579
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:49,641
And you know me doesn't want that to happen, homie.

580
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,879
Let's go to a party.

581
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:56,766
- So Breanna, you're not seeing Woody anymore?
- That is so over.

582
00:52:57,768 --> 00:53:00,328
Such a shame. I mean, you guys were the perfect couple.

583
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:03,237
I was only seeing him because he's the football captain.

584
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:06,840
Without me, he's just another dumb
jock with his brains in his shorts.

585
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:10,596
Which is convenient because not
much else is going on down there.

586
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:24,235
Loser! Drink up, man!

587
00:53:28,927 --> 00:53:32,840
Manicure, pedicure, face masks. Are we done yet?

588
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:38,126
Nell, I couldn't help noticing that
you're a little on the hairy side.

589
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:42,682
Down below.

590
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:48,363
You've got sort of a rainforest thing going on.

591
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:51,558
You're not supposed to be bushy?

592
00:53:52,806 --> 00:53:55,639
- We've all gone totally latino.
- Totally.

593
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:57,201
Really?

594
00:53:57,406 --> 00:53:59,203
You should too.

595
00:53:59,846 --> 00:54:01,757
You know, we could do it for you right now.

596
00:54:03,046 --> 00:54:04,684
Latino.

597
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:07,517
What the hell, let's do it!

598
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:10,921
OK girls, we've got a green
light on the Brazilian wax.

599
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:13,560
Tiffany, bring me scissors
and depilatory strips.

600
00:54:13,766 --> 00:54:16,838
Chanel, I'm gonna need towels and hot water.

601
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:21,324
Nell, sit back, relax and do exactly...

602
00:54:30,405 --> 00:54:31,838
One more, give me one more!

603
00:54:37,725 --> 00:54:39,204
Bite down on this.

604
00:54:40,045 --> 00:54:41,637
On three. One...

605
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:43,597
Maybe this is a bad idea.

606
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:48,720
Did I say you I love you, man?

607
00:54:49,845 --> 00:54:51,801
I really do love you, man.

608
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:56,074
You're like... my... twin brother.

609
00:54:57,485 --> 00:55:01,114
You're white but you're my twin brother.

610
00:55:05,725 --> 00:55:08,239
Man, this is some kind of brazilian.

611
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:12,796
How are you feeling?

612
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,916
A little better.

613
00:55:17,644 --> 00:55:20,556
- How much did you drink last night?
- I don't know.

614
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:25,195
I just remember feeling unusually
happy and having a really good time

615
00:55:25,404 --> 00:55:28,919
and then like somebody picked up
the room and started spinning it.

616
00:55:29,644 --> 00:55:31,043
I don't know, I'm an idiot.

617
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:35,522
Think of it as a rite of passage.
Go easy next time.

618
00:55:37,924 --> 00:55:39,357
Thanks for taking care of me.

619
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:48,496
- See you after lunch. We have stuff to do today.
- Yeah, I know.

620
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:54,597
Drop back, pump it and
then throw the ball.

621
00:55:56,443 --> 00:55:57,956
Alright, I can do that.

622
00:56:01,723 --> 00:56:03,156
No, you're telegraphing,
you're way telegraphing.

623
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:05,399
Watch me behind me how I do.

624
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,799
- What is it?
- What's what?

625
00:56:11,203 --> 00:56:13,592
That's sticking me in my ass.

626
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:16,595
We're meant to be playing football.

627
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:20,318
It's not my fault. I'm sorry.
It's your thing, not mine.

628
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:23,162
Yeah, but you're behind the wheel.
I guess that means you find me attractive.

629
00:56:23,363 --> 00:56:26,400
No actually, that means you find me attractive.

630
00:56:26,603 --> 00:56:29,037
Let's not read too much into it, OK.
This thing finds anything attractive.

631
00:56:29,243 --> 00:56:33,282
- That is such a guy thing to say.
- Can we just keep playing football, please?

632
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:36,522
Sure, as long as you keep
my dick out of your butt.

633
00:57:10,642 --> 00:57:13,361
Ah, came through the windows!

634
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:16,439
One of the many skills I've acquired lately.

635
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:21,791
Keep our voices down. If my mom knows
I have a boy in my room she'd spontaneously combust.

636
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:24,276
I'm trying to settle what
to wear for your interview.

637
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,790
Navy suit, white blouse
and sensible shoes.

638
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:28,992
You don't think something a little hotter?

639
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:31,597
It's an interview...

640
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:38,200
- You're joking.
- At least something I can control.

641
00:57:39,481 --> 00:57:43,076
I've been thinking. While we're like this

642
00:57:43,281 --> 00:57:46,830
I wonder if it would make sense if
we could go to the Homecoming dance together.

643
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:52,240
Not only because, well, who else
would we go with? I don't wanna get
stuck with pencil neck all night.

644
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:55,469
It wouldn't be a date.

645
00:57:58,361 --> 00:58:01,750
- I'd like that.
- Great. It's a date.

646
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,436
A non-date date.

647
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,234
Nell, wash hands! Dinner!

648
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,351
My cue to go.

649
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,678
Not a real date.

650
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,037
It's alright! I'm OK!

651
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,518
I will be kinda late tomorrow.

652
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,790
Kind of.

653
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,991
Kind of late tomorrow.

654
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,389
What is with you at the moment? Ted?

655
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,714
Sometimes I feel as though I
don't know who you are anymore.

656
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,354
She's growing up, Katherine.

657
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,755
So, are you going to tell me
what you're doing or is it a secret?

658
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:54,233
It's no secret, I'm studying with Woody.

659
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,554
Again?

660
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:57,392
Yeah, you've got a problem with that?

661
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:06,912
If you want to waste your
valuable time it's your affair.

662
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,632
Who says I'm wasting my time?

663
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:11,472
Oh Nell, you only have to look at the boy.

664
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:13,188
What's wrong with him?

665
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:15,833
He's stupid, he's trouble and he's a loser.

666
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:17,673
You told me so yourself.

667
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:24,194
There's nothing you can do to
change that. Look at his family.

668
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,628
That's basic genetics.

669
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:51,438
Hi, Mr Bedworth.

670
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,550
Is Nell around?

671
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:01,268
She's gone back to school, son, she said
she had to do some extra studying. She has
her interview with Yale tomorrow.

672
01:00:03,798 --> 01:00:05,117
Thanks.

673
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:11,592
- So, how have you been, Mr. Bedworth?
- I'm fine, Woody, just fine.

674
01:00:14,557 --> 01:00:18,345
- Well, give my best to your wife.
- I will do.

675
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:34,669
What are you trying to do?

676
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:43,636
- Stop, you're gonna hurt yourself!
- Back off!

677
01:00:45,997 --> 01:00:47,907
Why are you doing this?

678
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,790
Because this is who I am.

679
01:00:55,076 --> 01:00:57,590
This is all I've ever been.

680
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:01,986
And now not even that.

681
01:01:06,316 --> 01:01:09,114
Football's not who you are.

682
01:01:10,516 --> 01:01:12,552
You don't get it, do you?

683
01:01:12,796 --> 01:01:15,390
- People like you never do.
- People like me?

684
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:19,032
- What exactly is it people like me don't get?
- People like me!

685
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,951
Then educate me, please!

686
01:01:28,356 --> 01:01:30,471
We like to play ball.

687
01:01:31,515 --> 01:01:33,506
Maybe we're even pretty good at it.

688
01:01:33,715 --> 01:01:37,708
Maybe we get accepted to some
second rate shit kicker college

689
01:01:37,915 --> 01:01:43,035
or maybe we go work with our dad
at the spatula store. Who knows?

690
01:01:43,715 --> 01:01:48,266
But what we don't get is a great job,
a big apartment in the city

691
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:53,310
- and a Yale education.
- So that's what this is about. The interview?

692
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,192
I don't know!

693
01:02:01,795 --> 01:02:06,152
- It's OK to be nervous.
- Nothing is OK. Nothing!

694
01:02:07,915 --> 01:02:11,510
Tomorrow I'm supposed to be playing
the most important game of my life.

695
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:15,024
This is my destiny. Mine!

696
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:19,431
I'm not supposed to be
attending some college interwiew.

697
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:24,628
So we got the wrong lives. Sometimes
you just gotta get on with life.

698
01:02:25,394 --> 01:02:27,430
Let things fall into place.

699
01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:31,867
Do me a favour.

700
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:36,910
Save your inspirational speeches
for someone who gives a damn.

701
01:02:37,114 --> 01:02:38,706
I know who I am.

702
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:43,866
I'm a loser, I'm trouble and
I'm stupid. Basic genetics.

703
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:45,873
Can't help it.

704
01:02:48,794 --> 01:02:52,867
Funny. I never took you for a quitter.

705
01:03:57,672 --> 01:03:59,310
You can go in.

706
01:04:05,832 --> 01:04:07,151
Miss Bedworth?

707
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,384
Please take a seat.

708
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:18,989
One of the qualities we hope for in
any of our students is their passion.

709
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:23,706
Your turn papers and test results are exemplary.

710
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:30,100
But your love and knowledge of literature
is rare in a person of your years.

711
01:04:32,871 --> 01:04:35,465
Thank you, but it's an
important part of my life.

712
01:04:37,231 --> 01:04:39,142
Go on.

713
01:04:41,271 --> 01:04:44,502
Poetry, for instance

714
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:49,061
I like the way that it can
articulate and express feelings

715
01:04:49,271 --> 01:04:53,059
complicated and difficult feelings
that you can't express literally.

716
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,146
What about modern literature?

717
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:08,419
Are there any contemporary writers
and poets you particularly admire?

718
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:13,664
No. Not really.

719
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,827
Oh. Why is that?

720
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,061
Because they suck?

721
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:27,709
Welcome everybody to Homecoming,
the biggest game of the year.

722
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,784
Surely if poetry is no longer relevant

723
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:35,063
poets and their art form
are doomed to extincition.

724
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:45,541
I think that will be all.

725
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:04,577
Actually, I do like some modern poets.

726
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:07,179
In fact I love them.

727
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:11,427
50 Cent, Pete Pablo, Marshal Mathers.

728
01:06:11,629 --> 01:06:14,860
- I don't think I'm familiar with their works.
- Well, they're rap artists.

729
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:16,980
And you consider that to be poetry?

730
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:19,657
Absolutely. It's urban poetry, sir.

731
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:24,260
They talk about their lives and
experiences. They can be very brutal

732
01:06:24,469 --> 01:06:29,667
but often under a coat of humour.
Dark humour. Here, check it out.

733
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:34,863
Applauds for the home theme.
The Westdale Bay Beavers!

734
01:06:36,668 --> 01:06:38,863
That's my boy!

735
01:06:39,348 --> 01:06:41,259
Applauds for the quarterback, Woody Deanne!

736
01:06:41,468 --> 01:06:43,902
That's my boy!

737
01:06:47,228 --> 01:06:48,627
Wait!

738
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,460
Here we go!

739
01:07:12,427 --> 01:07:16,386
Number 83, Johnny Chancer.

740
01:07:32,827 --> 01:07:36,103
Hey you, leave him alone or
I'll sock you around!

741
01:07:50,826 --> 01:07:54,023
Touchdown for The Razorbacks, folks!

742
01:08:15,586 --> 01:08:18,498
Touchdown for The Razorbacks.

743
01:08:18,706 --> 01:08:22,255
As they take the lead, 14-0,
early in the fourth quarter.

744
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:26,903
There's still time folks, as Woody Deanne takes the play.

745
01:08:45,545 --> 01:08:49,333
12th yard loss. This is really unusual, folks.

746
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:53,580
You just messed with the wrong girl.

747
01:08:57,705 --> 01:09:00,378
Hi Nell. I didn't know football was your bag.

748
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:03,179
I just came to cheer the team.

749
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:06,015
We're not doing too good.

750
01:09:14,065 --> 01:09:18,137
That's my boy! He's my boy!

751
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:31,821
Touchdown for The Beavers by Harry the Horse!

752
01:09:33,384 --> 01:09:36,820
- Sit your fat arse down!
- Point taken, my good woman.

753
01:09:39,104 --> 01:09:41,572
- Do you want some of the dog?
- Yeah, thanks.

754
01:09:44,304 --> 01:09:45,862
Thanks, dad.

755
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:04,176
This is it, folks. Only 5 seconds to go.

756
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:08,252
Time for one more play. This is
make or break for The Beavers.

757
01:10:13,303 --> 01:10:14,577
Ready?

758
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:27,532
That's it, girl!

759
01:10:39,222 --> 01:10:40,860
Touchdown!

760
01:10:41,062 --> 01:10:44,293
The Westdale Beavers wins
at the very last moment!

761
01:10:44,502 --> 01:10:49,371
It's a touchdown by Woody Deanne and The Beavers wins!

762
01:11:02,942 --> 01:11:05,058
What are you waiting here for?

763
01:11:10,302 --> 01:11:13,533
Woody! You're the man!

764
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:16,816
Thanks.

765
01:11:17,382 --> 01:11:19,498
Great game, son.

766
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:23,416
- Decided for a college yet?
- I've had my heart set on Yale since I was a little girl.

767
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:27,732
That's funny. You know what,
get your parents to give me call.

768
01:11:28,221 --> 01:11:31,054
We're not Yale, but I think you
might like what we have to offer.

769
01:11:31,581 --> 01:11:34,379
- Thank you so much.
- No problem. Great game.

770
01:11:41,261 --> 01:11:44,492
You did it! You were great!

771
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:47,576
Did you see me out there?
I totally kicked ass!

772
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:50,534
And the guy back here, he
was a scout. He gave me his card.

773
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:55,136
- You're going to college. No spatulas.
- I saw.

774
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:59,334
You know what the best part is?
I totally loved it!

775
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:03,411
Your adrenaline gets pumping and
the crowd was totally into it.

776
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,370
The interview? Oh my god,
I totally forgot it.

777
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,215
How was it?

778
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,377
It was amazing.

779
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,977
I mean, the place was.

780
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,968
For a moment I really felt like part of it.

781
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,978
I gave my best shot.

782
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,178
I'm sure you did.

783
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,571
And that's all anyone can ask.

784
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:37,257
And I tell you something. They would be lucky

785
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:41,335
to have someone like you. Thank you.

786
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,458
Dito.

787
01:12:46,139 --> 01:12:50,052
You know, if I have to spend
my life as someone else

788
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,056
I'd be honoured to be you.

789
01:12:55,499 --> 01:12:56,818
Dito back at you.

790
01:12:58,019 --> 01:13:00,328
Double double dito.

791
01:13:23,059 --> 01:13:24,492
Woody?

792
01:13:26,019 --> 01:13:29,693
- Hey guys, I'm back!
- What are you talking about, 'back'?

793
01:13:35,298 --> 01:13:39,257
Hey there, Mr. Football hero.
Am I attractive enough for you now?

794
01:13:59,098 --> 01:14:02,534
- Please Mrs. Bedworth, I need to speak to Nell.
- She doesn't wish to speak with you.

795
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:03,887
I have to talk to her!

796
01:14:04,098 --> 01:14:08,728
She isn't going to the dance, Woody,
but she did say she hopes you have a good time

797
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,815
with Breanna Bailey.

798
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:17,013
For just one moment, Woody, I thought you had changed.

799
01:14:24,537 --> 01:14:28,325
Come on honey, why the sad face?

800
01:14:30,457 --> 01:14:32,095
You got everything we ever wanted.

801
01:14:55,976 --> 01:14:59,366
Oh my god! Look at that dress!

802
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:16,375
So, do you like my dress?

803
01:15:18,176 --> 01:15:21,486
- Yeah, you look nice, Breanna.
- It's so tight, it shows everything.

804
01:15:23,136 --> 01:15:25,127
I had to leave my panties off.

805
01:15:25,816 --> 01:15:27,966
Let's hope you don't get diarrhoea then.

806
01:15:28,456 --> 01:15:30,526
I'm gonna get some punch.

807
01:15:35,735 --> 01:15:36,929
Harry?

808
01:15:37,695 --> 01:15:38,969
Do you like my dress?

809
01:15:39,455 --> 01:15:40,808
Yeah baby, it looks good on you.

810
01:15:56,215 --> 01:15:59,491
- I am so nervous?
- Are you kidding me? You've got this in a bag.

811
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,165
Check the make-up? We won't be a minute.

812
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:06,208
Woody, straighten your tie. Photographers!

813
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:15,452
You know, seeing you in that tuxedo is making me feel kinda horny.

814
01:16:16,975 --> 01:16:20,171
- Let's do it in the bushes!
- Serious?

815
01:16:20,614 --> 01:16:23,447
Yeah, it'd be like doing it with James Bond.

816
01:16:23,774 --> 01:16:28,404
You know me: 009. License to thrill, hang on baby!

817
01:16:33,654 --> 01:16:34,609
Woody, wait!

818
01:16:35,614 --> 01:16:39,368
You wait over there, then I'll walk by like Halle Berry

819
01:16:39,574 --> 01:16:42,042
and then you jump up and grab me.

820
01:16:42,254 --> 01:16:44,085
Not a minute to miss.

821
01:17:00,213 --> 01:17:02,044
Ready when you are baby!

822
01:17:02,613 --> 01:17:04,524
Come and get me!

823
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:06,371
Chanel?

824
01:17:12,293 --> 01:17:13,965
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

825
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,330
Halle Berry wouldn't have done that.

826
01:17:22,293 --> 01:17:25,569
Good evening, Westdale Bay!

827
01:17:26,173 --> 01:17:30,052
And the presentation of the crowns of this year's...

828
01:17:39,093 --> 01:17:40,606
Hi, princess.

829
01:17:43,532 --> 01:17:45,568
So you're not going to the dance?

830
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,004
Does it have anything to do with Woody?

831
01:17:57,492 --> 01:17:58,845
Maybe.

832
01:18:00,812 --> 01:18:02,689
He likes someone else.

833
01:18:03,932 --> 01:18:06,002
But is she a princess?

834
01:18:07,972 --> 01:18:10,611
Anytime soon she'll be a queen.

835
01:18:10,892 --> 01:18:14,362
No contest. Princesses are younger and prettier

836
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:16,642
especially when they're my daughter.

837
01:18:21,452 --> 01:18:23,363
You really like him, don't you?

838
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:28,605
Me too.

839
01:18:29,731 --> 01:18:32,086
I think he's a good one.

840
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:34,085
I think you should go.

841
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,404
But I don't have anything to wear.

842
01:18:46,051 --> 01:18:48,121
Just a...

843
01:18:54,571 --> 01:18:58,962
Now, I'm not usually known for my taste in fashion
but the young lady in the store said it was 'dope'.

844
01:18:59,171 --> 01:19:01,162
I have no idea what that means of course.

845
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:06,808
It's beautiful.

846
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:13,728
She said you need these too. Apparently these are heavy.

847
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:17,248
For all I know they could be dope as well.

848
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:21,369
Thank you!

849
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,844
And the title of Westdale Bay High Homecoming King

850
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:27,563
goes to

851
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:32,565
our very own footballing hero, Woody Deanne!

852
01:19:49,889 --> 01:19:52,562
And now for the biggie

853
01:19:52,769 --> 01:19:57,843
this year's Westdale Bay Homecoming Queen is

854
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,526
Breanna Bailey.

855
01:20:13,889 --> 01:20:17,598
Thank you, Miss Bidermeyer. Principal Johnson.

856
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:20,318
And thank you, Westdale Bay!

857
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:24,005
There are so many people that I
need to share this great honour with.

858
01:20:24,209 --> 01:20:28,600
My mother whose undying support and
generous attitude towards cosmetic surgery.

859
01:20:28,809 --> 01:20:30,844
My hair dresser, Georgio Theodopolous

860
01:20:31,048 --> 01:20:37,123
Thank you, Breanna. Another round of
applauds please for Homecoming King and Queen!

861
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:39,404
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and temperate.

862
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:45,477
Rough winds bla bla bla something. Can't
remember. Yada yada yada.

863
01:21:48,887 --> 01:21:50,320
It's alright.

864
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,398
I'm no Shakespeare

865
01:21:54,887 --> 01:21:57,764
my guess is Romeo wasn't much of a quarterback, either, right?

866
01:21:58,966 --> 01:22:03,084
I really wish I had the most perfect and
beautiful words in the world to say to you

867
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:08,963
 cause if I did I'd say them but...
I'd say how great you make me feel when I'm with you.

868
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:13,964
And how I love that little thing you
do with your nose when you smile.

869
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:18,044
How you always correct my
stupid grammar. I hate it.

870
01:22:18,926 --> 01:22:20,359
But most of all

871
01:22:21,206 --> 01:22:26,519
I'd tell you that... you make me a better person.

872
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:30,924
My own person.

873
01:22:32,686 --> 01:22:35,883
And that's why I know that this means nothing.

874
01:22:39,485 --> 01:22:42,158
And you mean everything.

875
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:47,036
But hey, I'm just a stupid quarterback.

876
01:22:48,325 --> 01:22:50,077
I don't know the right words.

877
01:22:51,725 --> 01:22:54,000
Those were lovely words.

878
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:57,116
Perfect words.

879
01:22:57,685 --> 01:22:59,516
Come here, dumb jock.

880
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:02,001
Don't try to stop me, pencil neck.

881
01:23:05,445 --> 01:23:06,844
Stop that!

882
01:23:07,725 --> 01:23:09,556
I'm the Homecoming Queen.

883
01:23:10,205 --> 01:23:11,684
Let's get out of here.

884
01:23:14,005 --> 01:23:17,475
- I'm the Homecoming Queen.
- And you're a bitch!

885
01:23:18,685 --> 01:23:20,754
Nice ass, baby! How about a little swirl?

886
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:45,796
Did I miss this? Did Woody Deanne win?

887
01:23:51,644 --> 01:23:53,919
Sweet lord!

888
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:11,635
So, how are we gonna do this?

889
01:24:12,603 --> 01:24:15,481
You're going to your chicken
shit college and me going to Yale.

890
01:24:18,963 --> 01:24:23,400
You did it. It came this morning.
Congratulations!

891
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:26,079
You got in?

892
01:24:27,523 --> 01:24:29,002
Oh my god, I did it!

893
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:32,275
Me and you did really good, huh?

894
01:24:33,203 --> 01:24:34,158
You and me.

895
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,556
Or

896
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:38,032
I?

897
01:24:38,243 --> 01:24:40,677
Will you just kiss me already?

898
01:24:41,283 --> 01:24:43,035
Yes, ma'am.

899
01:25:23,082 --> 01:25:26,710
You can not be serious? A year of sabbatical? We're talking about Yale

900
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,355
for heavens sake, Yale!

901
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:33,920
I know mum. But what the heck?

902
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:09,069
If I may quote Snoop Dog:

903
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,358
Let's get it started!

904
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,632
Dope, huh?

905
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,876
See what I'm saying?

906
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,674
Actually, I'm not sure if this is Snoop

907
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:28,431
it could be One Eyed Peas or 38 Cents.

908
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,750
I'm down with it anyway, bitch.
