1
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,908
DEEP RED

2
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:37,956
Great!

3
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,420
Really, that's good. Very good.

4
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:48,174
Maybe a bit too good.

5
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,468
Too clean. Yes, too precise.

6
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:54,681
Too... formal. It should be more trashy.

7
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:58,309
See what I mean?

8
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:00,478
Remember that this sort of jazz

9
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:04,607
came out of the brothels...

10
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:11,739
...and this phenomenon, as the latest studies confirm,

11
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,909
is not restricted to superior species

12
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,121
but includes vertebrates and invertebrates as well.

13
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:20,248
Butterflies,

14
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,250
termites, zebras,

15
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:24,669
all these animals, and many more,

16
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:30,216
use telepathy to transmit orders and relay information.

17
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,220
This is a proven fact that can easily be demonstrated.

18
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:38,599
For instance, if we put a butterfly in a cage, within a few hours,

19
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:44,897
it will be able to gather many other butterflies around it

20
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:49,569
which will quickly swarm in, in answer to its call,

21
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:55,158
even covering a distance of several miles. This is telepathy.

22
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:59,787
The faculty comes naturally to the newborn in the early stages of life

23
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:05,918
but they lose it as they acquire means of verbal communication.

24
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:09,756
On the other hand, certain rare individuals,

25
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,551
for reasons as yet unknown to us, do not lose this faculty.

26
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:16,304
One such exception is Mrs Helga Ulmann

27
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:20,058
who is here in Italy for a series of conferences.

28
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:22,852
Helga has extraordinary telepathic powers.

29
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:26,898
We've been amazed by her natural inclination for the paranormal.

30
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,485
I will let her tell you herself. Helga Ulmann.

31
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,196
I would like to point out immediately

32
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,492
that my faculties have nothing whatsoever to do with magic,

33
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:42,288
the esoteric or fortune-telling.

34
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:47,126
I pick up facts the very moment they occur or have occurred

35
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:50,004
but nothing of what is to come.

36
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,758
I can feel thoughts the very instant they are formed.

37
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:56,594
Some I can even sense a long time afterwards,

38
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,013
being so strong,

39
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,767
that they linger about the room

40
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,977
like cobwebs.

41
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,735
You, sir.

42
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:20,118
Yes you, in the third row, with your right hand in your pocket.

43
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:25,581
You're clutching a bunch of keys.

44
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,168
Four keys, one of them very long.

45
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:34,632
It's true. Look, they're right here!

46
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,218
Your name is Pietro...

47
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,224
Forgive my pronunciation... Valgoi?

48
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,184
Yes, Valgoi, that's right.

49
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:48,896
Mr Valgoi, excuse me. May I ask you something?

50
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,190
Do you know Mrs Ulmann by any chance?

51
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,818
- No. - Forgive my persistence.

52
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:57,864
Could you have met her before and told her your name?

53
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:03,870
How could I? I live in Bologna. I only arrived in Rome three hours ago!

54
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:06,455
It's absolutely impossible.

55
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,583
Good, thank you, sir.

56
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,502
No, no!

57
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:15,798
Out! Out! No!

58
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:24,473
Excuse me.

59
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,642
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,022
There is something...

61
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,901
...someone.

62
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:39,447
No, I don't know what it is. Forgive me. I'm sorry.

63
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,407
Helga?

64
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:45,077
I can't explain what it was.

65
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:50,291
Something strange and sharp, like a knife

66
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,670
entering my flesh.

67
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:58,674
Please forgive me, but it's all right now, thank you.

68
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:06,098
I feel it again.

69
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,270
It's here. I can feel death.

70
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:17,860
I feel a presence.

71
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:25,159
I have entered into contact with a perverse mind!

72
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:30,414
Its thoughts are of death.

73
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:32,583
Go away!

74
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:39,298
You...

75
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:42,009
...have killed

76
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,595
and you will kill again!

77
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:51,519
That children's song

78
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,897
and that house down there

79
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,776
and...

80
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:02,196
...death.

81
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,323
And that blood!

82
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:07,159
I'm scared, I'm scared!

83
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:10,913
Helga, it's all right! Calm down, that's enough!

84
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,332
Yes, let's hide everything,

85
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:17,461
as if nothing happened in the house. Everything back the way it was.

86
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:20,047
No one must know, no one must find out!

87
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,260
Just forget, forget everything...

88
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,973
...forever... forever.

89
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,967
Are you OK?

90
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,597
Anything I can do for you? Get some help?

91
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:22,526
It was all so clear, believe me. It was so frightfully clear.

92
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:25,905
Like a thorn piercing my brain.

93
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:30,451
I heard his twisted thoughts,

94
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:33,913
cruel and yet childish at the same time.

95
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:37,291
How odd. Before, in front of the audience,

96
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:41,545
I couldn't express all the sensations that gathered in my mind,

97
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,757
but I'll write them all down tonight at home.

98
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:47,885
I'll let you have it tomorrow.

99
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:50,304
You may use it as you see fit.

100
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:55,393
I'm saying this because now, you see,

101
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:58,145
I also know who that person is.

102
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:12,618
- What's the matter? - No, it's nothing.

103
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:18,541
Those evil thoughts must be here, stagnating in this room.

104
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:23,170
Just a moment ago it came back to me.

105
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,716
I must admit I'm frightened. I'm really frightened.

106
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,864
I really need some rest.

107
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,075
I'm feeling very tired.

108
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:26,418
Shouldn't we talk about that right away?

109
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:36,845
I'd like this article to be published while I'm still in Italy.

110
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:44,436
Yes, I am alone.

111
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:13,132
Yes, I am a bit jumpy, but don't worry.

112
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:20,097
We'll talk again tomorrow?

113
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,582
Hinno, Marc!

114
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:15,671
Hinno? What does that mean?

115
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:18,215
What are you talking about?

116
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,635
A client just said it to me in the bar.

117
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,179
He said it's a Tahitian word.

118
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:28,976
Or was it Madagascar?

119
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:37,151
I'm so damn drunk, I can't even remember!

120
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:41,989
Anyway, it means

121
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:48,036
alla salute, cheers, a votre sante, sk?l!

122
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:55,335
Listen, Carlo, when I was in America I met a lot of people like you.

123
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,590
Heavy drinkers, they don't last long, you know?

124
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:03,010
Who says I want to last?

125
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,262
You're speaking like a true masochist.

126
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:08,223
You obviously have the vocation.

127
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:12,311
Definitely not a masochist, on the contrary.

128
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:14,396
You know...

129
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,278
...as long as I'm drunk...

130
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:25,657
...I'm as happy as a lark!

131
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:28,452
And I play better too!

132
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:34,416
I mean, the piano is like the body of a beautiful woman

133
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:38,003
and I tickle her.

134
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,261
Cut it out!

135
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:52,476
Speaking of pianos, my half hour of fresh air is up.

136
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,522
I'll go back in to bang out a few more notes.

137
00:16:56,606 --> 00:17:00,192
Otherwise, I won't get paid tonight.

138
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,903
On your feet, then. Up!

139
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,450
You know what, Marc?

140
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:12,746
The difference between you and me is purely political.

141
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,960
You see, we both play rather well.

142
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:25,509
But I am the proletarian of the pianoforte

143
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:29,555
while you are the bourgeois.

144
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:34,142
You play for the sake of art and you enjoy it.

145
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:36,520
I play for a living.

146
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,857
It's not the same thing.

147
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:45,445
My, my! One of your philosophies I wasn't aware of yet!

148
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:51,410
Actually, I just thought of it. I'm really sharp when I'm drunk.

149
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,833
What was that?

150
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,754
A scream, I'd say.

151
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:08,051
Who knows, maybe a rape.

152
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,975
I drink to you, deflowered virgin!

153
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,364
Bye, Marc.

154
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:33,702
- Bye. - Bye.

155
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:01,540
Five fatal blows, twelve wounds.

156
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:05,252
Probably from a hatchet or a butcher's cleaver.

157
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,798
The victim seems to be about 35 to 40 years old.

158
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:13,969
She has abrasions and cuts all over her body.

159
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:19,641
So, you're a foreigner, then?

160
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,935
Yes, I was born in London

161
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,356
but I lived in America for several years before coming here.

162
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:29,735
And what are you doing in Italy?

163
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,573
I'm a pianist. Jazz. I teach here at the conservatory.

164
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:37,951
- I teach jazz. - And you play the piano, right?

165
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:44,374
So, in that case you don't have a job, right?

166
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:49,129
- I told you, I'm a pianist. - Yeah, sure.

167
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:53,008
So, then, that's your only job.

168
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:56,762
Playing an instrument isn't a job? What is it, a joke?

169
00:20:56,846 --> 00:21:01,183
What are you saying? No, I would never say that.

170
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:06,521
In fact, in my family I have a cousin who plays the...

171
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,525
What?

172
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,360
The violin.

173
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,702
Strange paintings, huh?

174
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,748
Yes.

175
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:31,880
Did you move, change or take anything from here?

176
00:21:31,964 --> 00:21:35,675
Are you crazy? We're very careful not to move anything.

177
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,386
Why? Is there something wrong?

178
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:44,392
No, no. I mean... It's just an impression.

179
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:48,271
Sorry, you were asking?

180
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:51,316
Ah yes, the victim. After you.

181
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:55,445
You knew her, didn't you?

182
00:21:56,197 --> 00:22:00,742
I already told you, I live upstairs. Her name was Helga Ulmann.

183
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:03,328
- Coffee? - Thank you.

184
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:10,919
Tell me about the raincoat the murderer was wearing.

185
00:22:12,338 --> 00:22:16,842
Wait a minute. I didn't say the murderer was wearing it.

186
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:21,096
All I said was that I noticed a man with a dark raincoat

187
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,682
walking away from the building.

188
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:29,437
Good evening. Hi, everybody!

189
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,941
Get lost! You can't come in here.

190
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,987
Why not? With a crime like this, the first thing you do is call the press.

191
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:40,365
Get your hands off me! I told you, you can't come in here!

192
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:42,492
This is a complex investigation.

193
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:46,538
Look who's here. Gianna Brezzi.

194
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:49,457
Yes, Captain.

195
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,212
- Who told you about the crime? - I have my sources.

196
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:57,132
The victim was rather famous, even in Italy.

197
00:22:57,216 --> 00:23:01,261
In fact, she gave an important lecture this very afternoon.

198
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:04,890
What did this famous lady do?

199
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:08,727
She was a sort of magician.

200
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:13,273
She could read people's minds.

201
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:16,985
Well, I never! I thought she was...

202
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:20,655
You! Yes, I'm sure of it. You're the one who saw the whole thing.

203
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,034
The eyewitness extraordinaire!

204
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,914
Fabbroni, get me Mingozzi. I have something to tell him.

205
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:32,959
- Then call the station. - Yes, Captain.

206
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:38,173
Why must I go to the police station? I told you everything I know!

207
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:41,551
Your statement has to be typed up officially.

208
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:44,012
You know how it is with bureaucracy.

209
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:49,559
All your details are needed: place and date of birth, passport, etc.

210
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:01,363
My head is splitting!

211
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:09,246
And you, what the hell are you doing here at this hour?

212
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,666
I'm on my way home after four hours at the police station.

213
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:16,169
Oh yeah, right.

214
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,964
I forgot about the murder.

215
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:23,343
How did it go?

216
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:27,138
What kind of question is that? How do you suppose it went?

217
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:29,599
Come on, I'll walk you home.

218
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:33,770
No, thank you. I can make it by myself.

219
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,941
I can make it, I said!

220
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:50,078
Oh, my poor head, my head.

221
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:53,081
Tell me, how much did you drink?

222
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,086
Who knows? Who can remember anything about this night?

223
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,672
But I'm sure it must have been a lot.

224
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:05,385
Why not come to my place for coffee?

225
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:10,390
No thanks. Thanks anyway. I'd rather sleep in my own bed.

226
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:14,019
Bye.

227
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:18,106
Carlo? Carlo?

228
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:23,320
Did you see that man leaving the building?

229
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:24,446
A man?

230
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,241
Yeah, a man in a dark raincoat. Right after the murder.

231
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,202
I think he's the killer.

232
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:33,330
Wait, wait...

233
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:37,625
Yes, I saw him for a second from the back.

234
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,713
Listen, Carlo. Something very strange happened to me,

235
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:44,049
and I don't know if it's true or not

236
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:47,594
but when I went into that woman's apartment the first time

237
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:49,637
I thought I saw a painting.

238
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:53,016
But then a few minutes later it was gone.

239
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,226
What happened to me?

240
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:59,189
To you, nothing. But maybe the painting was made to disappear

241
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:01,941
because it represented something important.

242
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:06,863
- What did you say? - It represented something important!

243
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:08,823
No, I don't think so.

244
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:12,744
If I remember well, it was some sort of composition of faces.

245
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:15,163
It was very unusual.

246
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:21,419
Maybe you've seen something so important that you don't realise.

247
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:26,841
I'm just trying to understand, because...

248
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:32,764
You know, sometimes, what you actually see and what you imagine...

249
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,728
...get mixed up in your memory like a cocktail...

250
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:44,609
...where you can no longer distinguish one flavour from another.

251
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:46,653
But I'm telling you the truth!

252
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:50,532
No, Marc. You think you're telling the truth,

253
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:55,745
but in fact you're only telling your version of the truth.

254
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,041
It happens to me all the time.

255
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:14,597
That man there with the raincoat, that's Giordani.

256
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:18,893
He's a professor in psychiatry and a parapsychology enthusiast.

257
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:22,772
A great friend of Helga's. He practically kept her.

258
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:27,026
The man with the glasses is Mario Bardi.

259
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:32,991
He's also a clairvoyant and was a good friend of poor Helga.

260
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:07,442
Let's go.

261
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:24,834
By the way, I wanted to thank you.

262
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:28,505
Good to be brought to the attention of murderers!

263
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:29,589
Come on!

264
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:36,304
You may not believe me, but I don't have a steady boyfriend right now.

265
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:39,224
- Me neither. - I should hope not!

266
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:43,645
- I meant a girlfriend! - That's why you're always so jumpy.

267
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:46,523
Me jumpy? Oh, please! I'm not jumpy at all.

268
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,733
Yeah, right. Stop fidgeting!

269
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:52,070
And your hands are shaking. Tell me, what's going on?

270
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:55,073
How many times must I tell you, I'm an artist?

271
00:28:55,157 --> 00:29:00,119
In case you've forgotten, we artists are very sensitive people.

272
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:03,122
We don't have elephant hide like you journalists.

273
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:08,336
Elephant hide? I'm told I have very delicate skin.

274
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,881
You can touch it. Come on, try.

275
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:15,510
- Yes, not bad. - It's fantastic.

276
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:19,681
I know how to stop your jumpiness.

277
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:23,309
What? Here at the cemetery? Are you crazy?

278
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,521
I have other things on my mind. Do you understand?

279
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,315
- Sure, you're scared senseless. - I'm not scared!

280
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,151
Right. You're almost shitting yourself.

281
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:34,112
And it's all my fault.

282
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:39,200
I'd like to see him. I'm curious to see him face to face.

283
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:42,036
You'd be better off returning to England.

284
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,997
I actually decided to stay.

285
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:46,666
- You just decided? - Yes, maybe.

286
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,712
Anyway, I need to concentrate. I must try to remember.

287
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:53,590
I'm sure I saw something important that night

288
00:29:53,674 --> 00:29:56,801
but I can't remember what exactly!

289
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:02,181
Are you driving?

290
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:05,268
No, Marc, wait! I have to get in this side.

291
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:08,062
The other door is jammed. Oh, sorry!

292
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:20,908
Long live Italy!

293
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,959
That seat broke the other day. Is it uncomfortable?

294
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:35,173
Why don't you help with this murder story?

295
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:38,343
If you could give me a hand on this scoop,

296
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:41,929
maybe I can get away from reporting on the environment.

297
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:44,641
- What have you done? - Nothing.

298
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:48,686
- You've locked the door! - Why, shouldn't I have?

299
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:51,522
It jams. We'll need a mechanic to open it.

300
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:55,568
That's all we need. Damn!

301
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,529
The car's not exactly new, you know?

302
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:00,698
- Just drive fast, will you? - Why?

303
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:04,285
I'm a bit claustrophobic.

304
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:06,954
All right.

305
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:41,906
Tell me, Enrico, why do Australian boomerang sellers go bankrupt?

306
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,866
I don't know that one.

307
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:47,954
Because the goods are always returned!

308
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:51,499
Funny, don't you think?

309
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:56,129
- Is Carlo not in yet? - He never shows up before 10:00.

310
00:31:56,213 --> 00:32:00,925
Can you tell him I was looking for him? I need to speak to him urgently.

311
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,723
Everything in the house. Let's hide it all.

312
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:13,020
No, no one will ever find out.

313
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:16,065
We must forget.

314
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:20,194
We must forget everything.

315
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,196
Forever.

316
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:27,118
Forever. That's all.

317
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:33,124
She was pointing towards the middle of the sixth or seventh row.

318
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:37,462
And you can't remember anything? Not even a face?

319
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:39,297
No, that's impossible.

320
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:43,509
All the lights were on us and the stalls were in darkness.

321
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:49,932
I must say, I do seem to recall, while Helga was speaking,

322
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:53,060
I noticed some kind of movement

323
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:56,689
in the sixth or seventh or maybe the eighth row.

324
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,734
- I can't say exactly. - What kind of movement?

325
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:03,696
Sorry, what did you say? Could you repeat that, please?

326
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,074
I said what kind of movement?

327
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,118
It's hard to say.

328
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:12,872
As if someone had stood up and left the row,

329
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:16,209
but it was just an impression more than anything else.

330
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:19,045
With the lights on, we couldn't see anything.

331
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:25,802
You see? You're not jumpy any more.

332
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:30,056
You can even button your shirt without shaking at all.

333
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,934
Look, will you cut it out about being jumpy?

334
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:39,315
It's a question of my nature. It's my artistic temperament.

335
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:42,026
Why did you become a pianist?

336
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:47,323
Well, my psychiatrist would say it's because I hated my father...

337
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:53,412
...so when I press the keys, it's like smashing his teeth.

338
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,793
Actually, it's because I love music.

339
00:33:58,877 --> 00:34:02,463
What about you? Why are you a journalist?

340
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:05,007
Because I like working.

341
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:08,135
I think a woman has to be independent to be equal to a man.

342
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,055
Oh, God, let's not start on gender equality!

343
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,683
It's all rubbish, not true at all.

344
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,810
Men and women are different.

345
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:20,481
Women are delicate... Fragile.

346
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:23,776
What? Delicate?

347
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,780
Fragile?

348
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:45,631
- Why are you clearing the table? - Come here.

349
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:49,594
- What's this? - Arm wrestling.

350
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:53,264
Come on. Then we'll see who's delicate!

351
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:56,642
- Don't be ridiculous! - Are you afraid?

352
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:08,154
That was cheating, completely. You can't start before I'm ready!

353
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:13,159
- It doesn't count. Play by the rules. - You too!

354
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:16,579
We do it properly or not at all. Still want to try?

355
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:20,833
Will you play by the rules without cheating? Properly?

356
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,170
- Are you sure? - Yes!

357
00:35:29,217 --> 00:35:30,760
Let's go.

358
00:35:30,844 --> 00:35:33,930
Both elbows on the table, no sudden movements.

359
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:38,184
- I know the rules! - We'll start when I say, OK?

360
00:35:39,978 --> 00:35:44,315
Ready? Steady... steady, wait...

361
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,071
One...

362
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,074
...two...

363
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:55,618
...three...

364
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:57,578
Go!

365
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:16,305
That doesn't count either! You lifted your elbow off the table.

366
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:18,641
That's a dirty old trick!

367
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:22,979
- You're a cheat! It's so ridiculous! - You're right.

368
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:29,110
- You go around challenging people! - You're big and macho. I surrender.

369
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:31,946
So, where are we going now?

370
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,115
Where are we going?

371
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,325
I'm not going anywhere with you.

372
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,286
If anyone is going anywhere, I'm going by myself.

373
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:41,455
Oh, sure, but where?

374
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:46,127
I'm off to see a friend, if you must know. I have things to do.

375
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:50,089
I can't sit here all day arm wrestling just to keep you amused!

376
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:54,552
I'm on to something important, but I'm not saying what. Clear?

377
00:36:54,636 --> 00:37:00,099
Listen, don't be angry now. Why can't I go with you?

378
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:05,521
- We started this together, right? - No.

379
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:11,402
Statistics prove you can't work seriously with liberated women.

380
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:15,865
So, whether you like it or not, I'm going on my own.

381
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:20,161
Have it your own way, stupid!

382
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:25,458
I'll do my own investigation, and we'll see who comes out on top.

383
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:28,044
What's that? Another arm wrestling match?

384
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:30,963
Yes, sort of.

385
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,090
So be it. Wait!

386
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,926
You didn't tell me when I'll see you again.

387
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:37,970
Never.

388
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,930
Oh, really?

389
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:46,062
How about later tonight?

390
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:49,065
- When will you be back? - I don't know.

391
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:07,208
I'll try to call you.

392
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,879
OK. But I'll tell you again that I don't...

393
00:38:11,963 --> 00:38:14,715
If you don't want to, just say so.

394
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:19,512
I was just trying to say that I don't know what time I'll be back.

395
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,309
All right.

396
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:28,938
Bye.

397
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:34,401
Tell me the truth.

398
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:38,697
Do you find me so unattractive?

399
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:40,699
No.

400
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:45,287
So, what's wrong, then? My scent? What?

401
00:38:45,372 --> 00:38:47,706
Nothing at all, why?

402
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,960
Oh, nothing. I was just wondering.

403
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:54,046
Yes?

404
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,049
Excuse me, I'm Marc Daly. I'm a friend of Carlo's.

405
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,510
Oh, do come in, Marc.

406
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:02,847
I know you by name. Carlo mentions you very often.

407
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:05,391
You're an engineer, aren't you?

408
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:08,269
No, I'm a pianist. I teach at the conservatory.

409
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:11,355
A pianist? Please, come in.

410
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:15,359
What can I offer you? Coffee, a drink of something?

411
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:19,530
No, thank you, nothing. I just came to see Carlo.

412
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,575
He wasn't at the Blue Bar, so...

413
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:24,952
A drink? Is this all right?

414
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,332
It's Coca Cola! I'll just make some coffee...

415
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:34,962
No, please. Don't go to any trouble. I just came to see Carlo.

416
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:36,922
I'll call him, then.

417
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:42,595
I'm so absent-minded.

418
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,931
I'm sorry, Carlo is not here. He's gone out.

419
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:50,102
But come here, Marc. Come and talk to me.

420
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,272
Take a seat.

421
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:57,443
Tell me about yourself. How long have you been an engineer?

422
00:39:57,527 --> 00:40:01,614
- No. Madam, I'm a pianist. - And I'm an actress.

423
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:05,910
Or rather I was an actress. Look at those photos.

424
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:08,704
What do you think? Was I good or not?

425
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:13,792
Yes, I'm sure. I just wish I'd had the opportunity to...

426
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:20,132
Never mind. When I married Carlo's father, Carlo wasn't yet born.

427
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,552
He made me give up my career.

428
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:26,639
Now, it's all gone.

429
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:30,601
It's not important now. I console myself playing the piano.

430
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:35,189
- Do you play the piano? - The piano? I'm a pianist.

431
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:39,109
Oh, what a magnificent combination! A piano playing engineer!

432
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:41,362
Could we play a duet?

433
00:40:41,446 --> 00:40:45,074
No, unfortunately I don't have time.

434
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:49,703
I really need to see Carlo urgently. Do you know where he is?

435
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:51,830
He went to see a friend.

436
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:55,876
Someone called Massimo Ricci. 28 Via Crescenzio.

437
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,926
Sorry, my mistake.

438
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:21,568
I'm looking for a friend, Carlo.

439
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:24,446
His mother gave me this address. Is he here?

440
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:27,157
Yes, do come in.

441
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,453
Thank you.

442
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,091
You don't know how ill he's been. I wish I knew what's come over him.

443
00:41:44,175 --> 00:41:46,302
He's still very sick.

444
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:55,102
See. He's been like this for over an hour.

445
00:41:55,186 --> 00:41:57,938
He started drinking, as usual.

446
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:02,026
Maybe more than usual. Then he started talking nonsense.

447
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:08,407
Look who's here.

448
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:11,327
You caught me red-handed.

449
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:14,955
Good old Carlo.

450
00:42:15,957 --> 00:42:20,586
He's not only a drunk but a faggot as well.

451
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:22,880
Surprise!

452
00:42:22,964 --> 00:42:25,341
I don't give a damn about your preferences!

453
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:29,803
But I already told you, you won't last long if you drink so much.

454
00:42:29,888 --> 00:42:33,849
And I told you, who wants to last?

455
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:39,605
The liver is gone, and so are the intestines.

456
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:44,318
Come on, try to get up. Put your head under a cold tap. It will do you good.

457
00:42:44,402 --> 00:42:46,820
Then I'll take you out for some fresh air.

458
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:58,749
I love that guy. But he's always so sad.

459
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:01,710
He drank a lot today.

460
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:06,507
Then he started talking nonsense. I think he's cracking up.

461
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:09,885
He said he wanted to go away. Then he wanted to make love.

462
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:12,513
Then he wanted to sleep.

463
00:43:12,597 --> 00:43:14,807
He kept getting worse.

464
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:18,977
And then he started to scream. I was about to call a doctor.

465
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:26,568
Would you like some coffee?

466
00:43:26,653 --> 00:43:29,822
No, it's very late already.

467
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:34,034
I need to go, or I'll be thrown out of the Blue Bar for good.

468
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,500
Are you coming with me?

469
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:44,920
Yes.

470
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:55,097
Bye.

471
00:43:57,058 --> 00:44:01,228
Sorry... for what happened before.

472
00:44:01,354 --> 00:44:03,856
Don't be silly. Call me.

473
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:16,201
Goodbye.

474
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:26,003
- Why did you come looking for me? - I wanted to ask you something.

475
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:30,132
Remember the other night, the night of the murder?

476
00:44:30,216 --> 00:44:33,886
I said I thought I saw a painting in that house.

477
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,555
But a few moments later it was gone, remember?

478
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,600
- Vaguely. - Do you have a light?

479
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:49,568
You said that maybe the painting represented something important.

480
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:53,655
Then you said a lot of things about memory and truth.

481
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,408
Things I didn't understand at the time.

482
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,577
Yeah.

483
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:01,914
I remember something a bit muddled

484
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:04,875
but I can't remember what I wanted to say.

485
00:45:05,585 --> 00:45:09,254
I was probably talking nonsense. I was really drunk.

486
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,674
Listen to me, Marc.

487
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:17,429
Why don't you just pack up and clear out?

488
00:45:20,642 --> 00:45:24,937
What are you doing messing with this business anyway?

489
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:29,149
Why are you aggravating a madman? A maniac?

490
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:32,486
Anyone committing such a monstrous crime

491
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,655
has to be a maniac.

492
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,244
If you must know, I'm attracted to madmen.

493
00:45:40,328 --> 00:45:44,248
I can't help it. I have a morbid fascination for them.

494
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:46,458
But wait, wait. Listen.

495
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,839
That painting was definitely there. I didn't imagine that.

496
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:57,010
And I feel there's something important about it.

497
00:45:57,095 --> 00:46:04,309
So now... it's become a kind of challenge with my memory.

498
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,645
- A challenge. - Right, a challenge.

499
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:09,815
I challenge myself too, all the time.

500
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:13,944
And I always lose. But this is different for you.

501
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,324
If you lose, apart from the challenge,

502
00:46:20,785 --> 00:46:24,037
you'll end up getting murdered yourself!

503
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:28,625
...police have set up several checkpoints.

504
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:30,586
There's been no further news

505
00:46:30,712 --> 00:46:33,422
on the murder of German mind reader, Helga Ulmann.

506
00:46:33,506 --> 00:46:36,008
Police are concentrating their investigation

507
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:42,097
on a person seen leaving the scene of the crime that very night.

508
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:46,643
According to an unofficial newspaper report,

509
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:50,272
the eyewitness can identify the mysterious night visitor.

510
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:20,218
Carlo should be careful.

511
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:23,972
If they find out he's a good pianist, they'll get rid of him for sure!

512
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:12,427
Whoever you are, please help me!

513
00:52:12,511 --> 00:52:16,264
Marc? It's me, Gianna! What are you talking about?

514
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:19,976
You won't get away.

515
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:25,649
I'll kill you sooner or later.

516
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:28,944
Hello?

517
00:52:29,028 --> 00:52:33,156
- What is it? Hello? Hello? - Listen, Gianna!

518
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,036
There's somebody in the house. He spoke to me. He wants to kill me!

519
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,247
- Should I call the police? - Wait a second.

520
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:43,208
Hello?

521
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:16,741
No doubt about it. That's the same song I heard last night.

522
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,702
And if I remember correctly

523
00:53:18,786 --> 00:53:24,249
you said Helga talked of a children's song in the theatre.

524
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:30,380
That's right, and this song may well be the recurring theme of the crimes.

525
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:35,051
You see, we're starting to form what I presume to be the right profile.

526
00:53:35,136 --> 00:53:38,263
The murderer is a paranoid schizophrenic.

527
00:53:38,347 --> 00:53:41,641
Anyone who kills with such a frenzy

528
00:53:41,726 --> 00:53:44,436
surely does so in a state of temporary insanity.

529
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,399
In everyday life, this person could appear quite normal.

530
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:51,359
Like you or me.

531
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:56,197
When he kills, he must recreate these specific conditions

532
00:53:56,282 --> 00:53:59,325
which trigger the release of all his madness.

533
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:02,579
A particular time and day of the week, even clothing.

534
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:05,832
Something that recreates the same images

535
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:11,796
that frame a context that provoked trauma in the past.

536
00:54:13,674 --> 00:54:17,635
I'd like to add something that is somewhat less scientific

537
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,472
to this business of the children's song.

538
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:26,186
If you recall, as well as a child singing, Helga also mentioned a house.

539
00:54:26,312 --> 00:54:33,735
And I remember having read a strange book, quite some time ago.

540
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:39,699
I think the title was "The Modern Ghost and the Black Legends of Today".

541
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:43,286
The author spoke of a haunted house

542
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:50,085
where the neighbours could sometimes hear singing, like this little song.

543
00:54:50,169 --> 00:54:55,048
The book implied an act of bloodshed was once committed in that house.

544
00:54:55,132 --> 00:54:57,300
Do you have that book?

545
00:54:57,384 --> 00:55:03,306
No, but I think you could easily find it in the folklore library.

546
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,142
The Modern Ghost and the Black Legends of Today

547
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:19,364
"THE HOUSE OF THE SCREAMING CHILD

548
00:55:19,448 --> 00:55:22,033
"In a house near Rome, a strange thing happened.

549
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,202
"One night, a hunter woke before dawn

550
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:26,955
"and heard a child singing in a high shrill voice.

551
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,667
"Soon after, the voice stopped and he heard screaming and weeping."

552
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:28,683
No, nothing.

553
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:33,813
No news other than what Bardi gave me. No name, no address.

554
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:37,275
So, what are you going to do now?

555
00:56:37,276 --> 00:56:39,444
I'd like to contact the author.

556
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:44,032
Can you write down her name? Her name is Amanda Righetti.

557
00:56:44,116 --> 00:56:46,367
Got it.

558
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:59,589
What the hell! What are you doing? Why did you put the phone right here?

559
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:02,467
- What's the matter? - Nothing, listen.

560
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:06,137
Will you try to find out her address? It's important.

561
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,890
She should know where this house is.

562
00:57:08,974 --> 00:57:11,976
She probably knows other useful stuff too.

563
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:17,774
Listen, I'll call you back. I can't hear a thing in this bar.

564
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:22,528
- What did you say? - The address! Oh, this is impossible!

565
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:25,907
Can't you wait until I'm done? It's like a sauna in here!

566
00:58:01,235 --> 00:58:04,988
- When you come, remember the birds. - Don't worry, Miss Amanda.

567
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:11,661
I don't understand why you keep these strange lndian blackbirds.

568
00:58:11,745 --> 00:58:15,707
I feel less lonely. They imitate things, the television, our voices.

569
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:20,295
Oh, it's like having a madman around the house!

570
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:22,839
I'd be scared.

571
00:58:22,923 --> 00:58:25,633
- See you tomorrow. - See you, Elvira.

572
00:59:04,131 --> 00:59:06,007
Elvira!

573
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:03,583
The child.

574
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:06,169
The house.

575
01:01:06,253 --> 01:01:08,504
The ghost of the house.

576
01:06:55,352 --> 01:06:59,438
You have two choices. You can either flee to Lebanon, quickly...

577
01:06:59,523 --> 01:07:04,276
Or I can try to find out what's going on as soon as possible.

578
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:07,404
How long will the police take to find me?

579
01:07:07,447 --> 01:07:10,115
Did you take a taxi to Amanda's?

580
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,369
No, a rental car. Why haven't you fixed this seat?

581
01:07:13,453 --> 01:07:16,747
- I feel silly sitting so low down! - I forgot. Sorry.

582
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:19,458
They'll find you by your fingerprints.

583
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:22,753
I bet you left them all over the house, right?

584
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:25,422
It would take another Florence flood

585
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:27,716
to wipe them clean!

586
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,512
Say they find the body tomorrow morning.

587
01:07:31,596 --> 01:07:34,431
They'll check the prints against the usual suspects.

588
01:07:34,474 --> 01:07:37,434
It'll take them a while to connect both murders,

589
01:07:37,477 --> 01:07:40,521
but in the end they'll be after you.

590
01:07:40,605 --> 01:07:43,899
You only have a couple of days. It's not long.

591
01:07:45,402 --> 01:07:49,780
No, it's not. But first, I have to find this.

592
01:07:53,285 --> 01:07:58,163
What a nice house. It looks strange. Do you know where it is?

593
01:07:58,248 --> 01:08:01,125
I wouldn't have to look for it if I knew!

594
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:05,921
- So, what are you going to do? - I'm not telling you.

595
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:09,592
It seems like everything here has ears.

596
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:12,720
How could the killer know I was coming here?

597
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:15,097
I have no idea.

598
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,811
One thing's for sure. I'm not telling anyone my next move.

599
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:24,523
This is so unbelievable! You're so nice!

600
01:08:24,566 --> 01:08:28,110
Hey, darling, I hope you don't think that I'm...

601
01:08:28,194 --> 01:08:32,281
Listen, I'm doing this to protect you, to keep you out of danger.

602
01:08:32,365 --> 01:08:35,534
- I promise, as soon as I... - Blah, blah, blah!

603
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:39,663
I swear, as soon as I discover something, I'll tell you.

604
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:43,792
Why don't we stop this stupid childish competition?

605
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:45,961
We should be working together.

606
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:49,048
You know, two brains are better than one.

607
01:08:50,383 --> 01:08:52,968
Just where do you women keep your brains?

608
01:08:53,053 --> 01:08:55,387
Let's be honest. Women have brute force,

609
01:08:55,513 --> 01:08:59,850
you beat us at arm wrestling, but men have the monopoly on intelligence.

610
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:02,603
- Have I made myself clear? - Yes, very clear.

611
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:04,772
At last.

612
01:09:05,982 --> 01:09:08,317
A little drink?

613
01:09:09,569 --> 01:09:13,238
I have Anisette,

614
01:09:13,323 --> 01:09:16,408
Sambuca, Caffe Borghetti.

615
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:19,411
Don't you have anything less sickly?

616
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:23,582
Whisky? Cognac?

617
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,543
Yes, that's better.

618
01:09:30,548 --> 01:09:33,759
We'd be more comfortable at my place, don't you think?

619
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:37,763
Maybe, but we're fine here.

620
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:41,183
Yes, but I think it would be better at my place.

621
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:45,354
OK, let's go.

622
01:09:58,201 --> 01:10:01,537
Who do you think you are, idiot?

623
01:10:01,621 --> 01:10:04,832
I've never met a man as arrogant as you!

624
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:07,543
You must have been spoilt rotten by women!

625
01:10:07,585 --> 01:10:12,172
Anyway, it's because I don't have a boyfriend right now. That's all!

626
01:10:12,257 --> 01:10:14,466
You've got such a big head.

627
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:17,636
- Oh, damn. - What's wrong?

628
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:19,847
Guess.

629
01:10:32,902 --> 01:10:35,863
Yes, it's a dracaena indivisa.

630
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:39,867
I'm sure of it. An exotic tree that grows in the Canaries.

631
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:43,287
It's highly delicate. It suffers if exposed to cold.

632
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:47,708
We've never imported it. It's very rare in or around the city.

633
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:51,253
- No, sir, never handled it myself. - Thanks.

634
01:10:51,337 --> 01:10:52,963
No, never.

635
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,923
- Yes. - Are you sure?

636
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:57,676
Absolutely. But it was a long time ago.

637
01:10:57,761 --> 01:11:01,930
I remember because I'd just opened. I ordered some from the Canaries.

638
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:06,727
Unfortunately, most died. The climate here isn't right for them.

639
01:11:06,811 --> 01:11:10,481
I had lots of complaints. I never ordered them again.

640
01:11:10,523 --> 01:11:13,317
- Who did you sell them to? - I'll check.

641
01:11:13,401 --> 01:11:16,153
I'll look up the old invoices. Why do you care?

642
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:19,865
I'm an architect. It's for an environmental study.

643
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:21,950
Well, let's see what we can find.

644
01:11:21,993 --> 01:11:26,288
Where's my bottle? Spit out my bottle, for Christ's sake! Damn you.

645
01:11:26,372 --> 01:11:29,750
Captain, finally! I've been looking for you for an hour!

646
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:32,836
What do you want? Does no one check these machines?

647
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,255
They do, but they steal the drinks.

648
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,050
Of course! This place is full of thieves!

649
01:11:38,134 --> 01:11:42,930
- Sorry, sir, but you're not thinking. - Not you, idiot.

650
01:11:43,014 --> 01:11:46,558
So, are you doing overtime?

651
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:49,478
Yes. The strike's been called off for now.

652
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:52,981
Our requests are examined by the Ministry.

653
01:11:53,066 --> 01:11:57,277
- But we're planning a sit-in. - What are you planning?

654
01:11:57,362 --> 01:12:01,156
A protest sit-in. We all gather outside in the courtyard

655
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:03,575
and stay there for one, two, four hours...

656
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:07,454
- What did you want to tell me before? - I almost forgot.

657
01:12:07,539 --> 01:12:10,499
The chief is here and he insists on speaking to you.

658
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,376
Oh, crap!

659
01:12:13,378 --> 01:12:17,339
Hello? Is that Professor Giordani?

660
01:12:18,383 --> 01:12:22,803
This is Marc Daly. I need to talk to you. It's very important.

661
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:28,016
No, I'd like to see you right now, if possible.

662
01:12:28,101 --> 01:12:30,727
Amanda Righetti was murdered.

663
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:40,571
Her arm was out to the side and her finger was pointing at the wall.

664
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:43,031
It didn't look natural to me.

665
01:12:43,116 --> 01:12:47,202
It was as if she was trying to point something out.

666
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,835
Do you think they've discovered the body by now?

667
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:56,086
Yes.

668
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:59,715
Maybe the pointing finger is a figment of your imagination.

669
01:12:59,799 --> 01:13:03,760
I'll go over there and take a look. You never know.

670
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:28,011
FOR SALE TO LET

671
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:39,106
I'm just the caretaker. The house belonged to Carl Schwartz.

672
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:41,316
- Where is he now? - He died.

673
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:43,819
He was a German writer, an odd sort of fellow.

674
01:14:43,903 --> 01:14:46,405
He bought the place in '68, I think.

675
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:49,157
Before then it had been empty for a long time.

676
01:14:49,242 --> 01:14:52,119
People used to say it was haunted by ghosts.

677
01:14:52,203 --> 01:14:56,623
Schwartz never heard the rumours. He just thought the price was right.

678
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:59,459
Knowing him, he'd have bought it with the ghosts.

679
01:14:59,544 --> 01:15:04,172
- And who lived there before? - I don't know. I came here in '67.

680
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:09,136
This writer, Schwartz. Do you know how he died?

681
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:12,472
An accident, poor fellow. He fell out of a window.

682
01:15:12,557 --> 01:15:15,142
I'm the one who found her, you know?

683
01:15:15,226 --> 01:15:17,811
This morning, very early, around 8:00.

684
01:15:17,895 --> 01:15:21,815
I come every morning to clean the house.

685
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:24,609
I could have died of shock!

686
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:29,698
The police kept me for hours asking all sorts, wanting to know everything.

687
01:15:29,782 --> 01:15:32,492
But what could I tell them? What do I know?

688
01:15:32,577 --> 01:15:35,704
It hasn't been half an hour since they took out the body!

689
01:15:35,788 --> 01:15:38,915
Poor Amanda. Who could have done that?

690
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,046
A maniac, who else? It's always a maniac and they never catch them!

691
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,340
Where was the body?

692
01:15:46,424 --> 01:15:48,925
In the bathroom.

693
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:51,636
Come, I'll show you.

694
01:15:56,851 --> 01:16:01,396
Look at all this blood. It's everywhere.

695
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:03,398
I'm going to clean up a bit.

696
01:16:03,483 --> 01:16:06,318
I leave before it gets dark. I'm not staying here alone!

697
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:10,989
Excuse me, I want to at least clean these marks off.

698
01:16:26,631 --> 01:16:28,298
Excuse me.

699
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:33,553
Hello?

700
01:16:33,596 --> 01:16:36,932
Oh, it's you, Francesca.

701
01:16:37,016 --> 01:16:40,519
Oh, if you only knew what I've been through.

702
01:16:40,561 --> 01:16:43,563
No, no. They've gone.

703
01:16:43,606 --> 01:16:46,566
Yes, they took her away.

704
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:50,529
Yes, they questioned me. It was never-ending!

705
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:55,283
A big man with a moustache said I was an important witness,

706
01:16:55,368 --> 01:16:58,787
that I could help him. I know quite a bit.

707
01:17:01,624 --> 01:17:04,835
Of course I told him everything!

708
01:17:06,963 --> 01:17:10,465
Oh, don't worry, I'll take the 6:30 bus...

709
01:17:48,212 --> 01:17:51,006
IT WAS...

710
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:58,555
What are you doing? Why are you running the hot water?

711
01:17:58,639 --> 01:18:02,976
I just wanted to find out who murdered Amanda.

712
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,645
With hot water?

713
01:18:05,688 --> 01:18:08,398
Yes, with hot water.

714
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,651
Do you know if the police found anything?

715
01:18:11,736 --> 01:18:13,778
Just a little doll.

716
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:18,241
- Anything else? - I heard them mentioning a child.

717
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:22,204
Of course.

718
01:18:23,789 --> 01:18:25,790
A child.

719
01:18:30,421 --> 01:18:32,506
That's right.

720
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,383
A child.

721
01:18:48,731 --> 01:18:52,359
My daughter will go with you. I don't have time right now.

722
01:18:52,443 --> 01:18:56,530
- There's no rush to return the keys. - OK. Thank you.

723
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:01,826
Olga!

724
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:04,120
Come back this minute!

725
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:06,581
Come on!

726
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:19,844
- What is it? - You little witch.

727
01:19:19,929 --> 01:19:23,014
I told you not to do that again!

728
01:19:23,099 --> 01:19:25,684
Now off you go!

729
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,111
- What did you do? - I didn't do anything.

730
01:19:36,195 --> 01:19:39,781
Don't worry, my father's just a little crazy.

731
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:15,525
Bye.

732
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:23,742
Go home. I'll return the keys later.

733
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,246
- Be careful! - Why?

734
01:20:28,331 --> 01:20:32,125
- There are ghosts in there! - What ghosts?

735
01:20:32,209 --> 01:20:35,670
I don't know, but everyone around here says so.

736
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,552
Bye.

737
01:29:56,899 --> 01:29:58,316
Mr Daly!

738
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,360
- Mr Daly! - Yes?

739
01:30:01,445 --> 01:30:04,697
Thank goodness! We didn't see you come back.

740
01:30:04,781 --> 01:30:07,992
- Anything wrong? - No, I was about to leave.

741
01:30:08,076 --> 01:30:11,913
The lights were cut off a couple of years ago.

742
01:30:11,997 --> 01:30:14,707
No one was living here.

743
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,014
What happened to your forehead?

744
01:30:30,098 --> 01:30:33,684
It's nothing, just a scratch. A piece of glass fell on my head.

745
01:30:33,769 --> 01:30:36,354
I warned you to be careful.

746
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:37,326
Giordani.

747
01:35:46,289 --> 01:35:49,792
- Hello, Gianna? - Hi Marc. Having fun?

748
01:35:49,834 --> 01:35:53,045
I'm having a ball. I finished two crossword puzzles.

749
01:35:53,129 --> 01:35:55,798
Well, I have a tough puzzle to solve here.

750
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:58,175
They killed Giordani not long ago.

751
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:01,637
The neighbours called the police. They heard screaming.

752
01:36:05,475 --> 01:36:09,728
- What happened there? - Nothing, it's just a scratch.

753
01:36:09,813 --> 01:36:11,689
Listen.

754
01:36:12,732 --> 01:36:17,736
Seriously, I have to admit I don't know what's going on right now.

755
01:36:19,364 --> 01:36:24,451
This son of a bitch knows everything! He knows every move in advance.

756
01:36:24,536 --> 01:36:27,788
Sorry, but I don't remember where you said I should flee to?

757
01:36:27,872 --> 01:36:30,457
- Lebanon. - Yeah, right.

758
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,876
Lebanon.

759
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:36,672
But I'd have to fly to get there and I'm scared of flying.

760
01:36:36,756 --> 01:36:39,008
It's nothing to be nervous about.

761
01:36:39,092 --> 01:36:42,886
Just think you'll be landing soon, one way or another.

762
01:36:42,971 --> 01:36:45,598
Thank you.

763
01:36:45,682 --> 01:36:48,767
How about we take the car and drive to Spain?

764
01:36:48,852 --> 01:36:52,438
We? You mean that I can come too?

765
01:36:52,522 --> 01:36:57,276
- Yes, if you'd like to. - Of course I'd like to!

766
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,571
We'll have a fantastic holiday!

767
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:04,700
Sun, sea, bullfights, parties, flamenco... How does it sound?

768
01:37:04,743 --> 01:37:07,703
Sure, of course. I suggested it, after all.

769
01:37:07,787 --> 01:37:10,998
I don't know about you but I'm on the verge of a breakdown.

770
01:37:11,082 --> 01:37:14,126
There's no point staying here and talking about it.

771
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:19,423
Come on. Let's not waste any time. You go back home and pack.

772
01:37:20,383 --> 01:37:22,384
I'll be back in an hour!

773
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:28,599
We'll have to rent a car, because mine isn't good for long trips.

774
01:37:28,683 --> 01:37:30,601
I know.

775
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:33,562
I love you!

776
01:37:36,358 --> 01:37:38,817
And who's this?

777
01:37:40,236 --> 01:37:45,032
An old girlfriend. Her name is Carol.

778
01:37:45,116 --> 01:37:49,370
- From Rome? - She's American. She lives in Paris.

779
01:37:49,454 --> 01:37:54,541
You used to go for vamps, then? You like super sexy women.

780
01:38:48,513 --> 01:38:52,725
Hello? Good evening. This is Marc Daly.

781
01:38:52,809 --> 01:38:58,063
- Oh, the engineer. - No, the pianist. Remember?

782
01:38:58,148 --> 01:39:00,441
Could I speak to Carlo? Is he home?

783
01:39:00,483 --> 01:39:04,862
He just went out. Would you like to come here and wait for him?

784
01:39:04,946 --> 01:39:07,865
We could chat. Time flies when you have company.

785
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:11,785
Besides, maybe you didn't know, but I used to be an actress.

786
01:39:11,911 --> 01:39:15,998
- What an idiot. - I could recite... What did you say?

787
01:39:16,082 --> 01:39:18,792
Nothing, sorry. Good evening.

788
01:39:26,468 --> 01:39:28,927
Why didn't I notice that before?

789
01:39:30,513 --> 01:39:33,390
Gianna - I'm at 24 Via Susa. Marc x

790
01:40:01,085 --> 01:40:03,253
I was right.

791
01:40:03,338 --> 01:40:05,464
There's no window.

792
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:34,845
Great!

793
01:45:43,094 --> 01:45:46,888
Forget it. It's too late.

794
01:45:47,682 --> 01:45:49,558
What happened?

795
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,436
I found your note and I hurried here.

796
01:45:53,521 --> 01:45:57,149
I saw a reddish light in one of the windows.

797
01:45:57,191 --> 01:46:01,695
So I looked for you. You'd passed out, lying in the flames.

798
01:46:03,281 --> 01:46:05,365
You know, you're lucky to be alive.

799
01:46:05,449 --> 01:46:09,494
A few more minutes and you'd have been roast chicken!

800
01:46:09,537 --> 01:46:11,621
Damn it! It's all lost.

801
01:46:12,248 --> 01:46:17,711
The body, the walled-in room and that picture on the wall.

802
01:46:32,977 --> 01:46:37,063
Yes, 24 Via Susa. My name is Gianna Brezzi, I'm a reporter.

803
01:46:37,148 --> 01:46:40,275
Yes, of course it's urgent. Try and hurry up.

804
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:48,867
Yes, hello, Fire Department? I want to report a fire at 24 Via Susa.

805
01:46:48,951 --> 01:46:51,119
What's the phone number here?

806
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:55,457
831-4726.

807
01:46:56,209 --> 01:46:59,461
Please hurry, the fire has been burning for a while.

808
01:46:59,545 --> 01:47:03,632
I want to know how it started in the first place.

809
01:47:04,592 --> 01:47:06,718
Well, if there are ghosts...

810
01:47:14,852 --> 01:47:17,145
- Who gave you this? - I did it.

811
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:19,940
That's impossible! You couldn't have seen it!

812
01:47:19,982 --> 01:47:22,567
Who gave it to you? Don't lie to me!

813
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:27,113
Leave her alone. She made it up. She's a strange child.

814
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:31,618
If you could just see what she does to animals! She likes the macabre.

815
01:47:31,702 --> 01:47:35,580
That may be true, but she couldn't possibly have imagined this!

816
01:47:35,581 --> 01:47:37,791
It's identical to the one in the house!

817
01:47:37,875 --> 01:47:40,335
I saw it at school.

818
01:47:40,461 --> 01:47:43,797
Good girl. Now tell me where you got this. Just tell me.

819
01:47:43,881 --> 01:47:47,592
One day, as a punishment, they made me clean up the archives.

820
01:47:47,677 --> 01:47:50,637
There were lots of drawings, and in a '50s file,

821
01:47:50,721 --> 01:47:53,056
there was one just like that.

822
01:47:54,392 --> 01:48:00,188
- Where do you go to school? - The Leonardo da Vinci School.

823
01:48:10,866 --> 01:48:11,866
LEONARDO DA VINCI STATE MIDDLE SCHOOL

824
01:49:30,029 --> 01:49:31,196
HEADMASTER

825
01:49:32,031 --> 01:49:33,448
SECRETARY

826
01:49:39,205 --> 01:49:40,955
ARCHIVES

827
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:07,524
There must be a million of them!

828
01:50:07,608 --> 01:50:11,694
They're all divided by subject and academic year.

829
01:50:17,201 --> 01:50:19,327
DRAWINGS

830
01:50:39,765 --> 01:50:41,182
Academic Year 1951-52

831
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:42,517
Academic Year 1950-1951

832
01:51:10,421 --> 01:51:13,131
- What is it? - Didn't you hear that?

833
01:51:14,675 --> 01:51:16,551
No, what was it?

834
01:51:16,635 --> 01:51:20,722
I don't know. I can't describe it.

835
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:29,105
You keep at it. I'm going to take a look.

836
01:51:50,085 --> 01:51:54,130
What do you say, I call the police and tell them we're here?

837
01:51:54,215 --> 01:51:56,299
Yeah, you're right.

838
01:52:08,896 --> 01:52:11,022
Gianna.

839
01:52:35,339 --> 01:52:37,215
Gianna!

840
01:54:07,848 --> 01:54:10,433
Marc, help me.

841
01:54:18,901 --> 01:54:21,903
Gianna, darling!

842
01:54:24,823 --> 01:54:27,367
Stay calm, darling.

843
01:54:30,329 --> 01:54:33,790
All this for some shitty article!

844
01:54:38,295 --> 01:54:40,213
You know who it is?

845
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:43,007
Yes, I know.

846
01:54:43,926 --> 01:54:46,803
I found the picture.

847
01:54:46,887 --> 01:54:49,972
Did you get that? It's not far, you'll see it right away.

848
01:54:50,057 --> 01:54:52,558
The name is over the door. Leonardo da Vinci.

849
01:55:15,124 --> 01:55:17,500
Don't hide.

850
01:55:20,796 --> 01:55:23,089
It's no use hiding.

851
01:55:30,431 --> 01:55:32,515
I know who you are now.

852
01:55:38,814 --> 01:55:40,898
I read your name.

853
01:55:42,526 --> 01:55:44,944
Carlo.

854
01:55:45,779 --> 01:55:48,990
I got here too late. What a shame.

855
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,831
So, now what are you going to do?

856
01:55:58,584 --> 01:56:00,668
Kill you.

857
01:56:00,753 --> 01:56:04,839
And I'm sorry because I like you.

858
01:56:08,677 --> 01:56:10,803
But I have to do it.

859
01:56:15,017 --> 01:56:17,727
I told you to stay out of it.

860
01:56:18,687 --> 01:56:21,063
Pack up and clear out, I said!

861
01:56:24,568 --> 01:56:29,113
Why didn't you listen to me?

862
01:56:32,534 --> 01:56:35,328
Because you're stupid and stubborn.

863
01:56:38,165 --> 01:56:40,875
Don't you realise it's all your fault?

864
01:56:45,088 --> 01:56:48,049
You wouldn't let it go.

865
01:56:48,133 --> 01:56:52,845
If you hadn't got involved, if you hadn't stuck your damn nose in...!

866
01:57:08,111 --> 01:57:10,196
You'll pay for this.

867
01:57:14,201 --> 01:57:16,577
He could have killed you!

868
01:57:16,662 --> 01:57:20,623
- Over there! The wall! - Stop or I'll shoot!

869
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:36,991
- She's out of danger. - When will she wake up?

870
01:58:37,075 --> 01:58:41,412
Not until tomorrow. The operation was difficult, but successful.

871
01:58:41,496 --> 01:58:43,456
She's a strong girl, don't worry.

872
01:59:43,392 --> 01:59:46,686
No, that's impossible.

873
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:50,731
He was with me when Helga was killed.

874
01:59:51,525 --> 01:59:55,528
He saw the killer too. It couldn't have been him!

875
01:59:55,612 --> 01:59:59,699
It had nothing to do with him. So why?

876
02:00:07,499 --> 02:00:09,417
POLICE INVESTIGATION

877
02:00:24,725 --> 02:00:27,018
Maybe that painting was made to disappear

878
02:00:27,102 --> 02:00:29,478
because it represented something important.

879
02:00:29,521 --> 02:00:33,357
Something so important that you wouldn't even realise it.

880
02:00:33,442 --> 02:00:36,277
Important.

881
02:00:37,070 --> 02:00:39,447
That painting...

882
02:01:12,898 --> 02:01:15,191
A mirror.

883
02:01:24,367 --> 02:01:28,370
What an idiot. It was just a mirror.

884
02:01:29,289 --> 02:01:31,916
There never was a painting there.

885
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,087
What I saw was a reflection in the mirror.

886
02:01:39,674 --> 02:01:42,176
I saw the face of the murderer.

887
02:01:55,732 --> 02:01:59,318
Damn you... Damn you!

888
02:01:59,402 --> 02:02:03,239
You caused my son's death! He had nothing to do with any of this!

889
02:02:03,323 --> 02:02:05,157
He was...

890
02:02:09,329 --> 02:02:14,416
He was only trying to protect me.

891
02:02:15,418 --> 02:02:18,504
He never hurt anyone!

892
02:02:19,506 --> 02:02:22,633
What do you know about what happened?

893
02:02:28,014 --> 02:02:32,059
Now, don't worry. Nothing's going to happen to you.

894
02:02:32,144 --> 02:02:35,938
It's all right. I'll take you to the clinic myself.

895
02:02:36,022 --> 02:02:40,109
No, I told you, I'm not going back there again.

896
02:02:40,193 --> 02:02:44,613
I told you. You can't force me again.

897
02:02:44,698 --> 02:02:49,493
But it's for your own good, dear. You heard what the doctor said.

898
02:02:49,578 --> 02:02:59,587
No.
