1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,718
Alright, fellas. Stand up for
the count. Stand up.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,712
Hayman.
- Here.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,514
Hathford.
-- Here.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,399
Morning ladies, morning.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,868
Ellersby.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,314
Madlock.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,190
McChaughney.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,271
Let's move it.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,955
<i>You asked me about
my worst secret.</i>

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>My most personal secret.</i>

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,680
<i>The secret of all my secrets.</i>

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,193
<i>...but first</i>

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,356
<i>I'm Vince Rizzo.</i>

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,555
<i>I wanna begin by telling you
about where I live.</i>

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,992
<i>City Island is a fishing village
located in Le Bronx, New York.</i>

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,316
<i>Not City Island is distinct
from the rest of Le Bronx</i>

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,676
<i>by virtue of being located
on its own two-lane spit</i>

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,711
<i>right in the middle of the South.</i>

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,474
<i>Most people don't believe
it until they see it.</i>

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,717
<i>And within the one square mile
that comprises all there is of City Island</i>

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,678
<i>lies yet another distinction.</i>

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,031
<i>That of the mussel sucker
versus the clam digger.</i>

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,109
<i>The mussel sucker is an island resident
who moved here from somewhere else.</i>

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,353
<i>The clam diggers like myself were
born and bred on City Island.</i>

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,990
<i>preferably in the same house which've
been handed down to other generations.</i>

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,952
<i>In short, the world can be divided between</i>

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,957
<i>Clam diggers and mussel suckers.</i>

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,709
<i>Those who stay and
those who wander.</i>

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,474
<i>You asked me about my worst secret
my most personal secret</i>

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,750
<i>The secret of all my secrets.</i>

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,959
<i>Well, like most of us...</i>

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,036
<i>I guess I have a few.</i>

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,031
Vince, I need the blow dryer.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,398
Vince, I need the blow dryer.
- Coming.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,596
- Hey Vinnie, are you ready for your test today?
- Totally.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,360
I'm gonna start my car.
Be there in five minutes.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,949
Morning.

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,388
Hey, call Vivian, will you?
Find out what bus she's taking.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,953
Is she staying over?

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,633
Spring break.
She's here all week.

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,070
We'll probably go out
for Mexican tonight.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,911
I can't, I got a poker game.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,599
You're daughter is home from college
and all you can think about...

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,073
She's here all week, right?

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,669
Just make an early dinner and don't
let it start with me, please.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,349
Somewhat, Vince, you were fixing
the boatshed or tearing it down.

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,359
Pick whatever you want,
coz I don't have time, alright.

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,475
Hey, Sheryl.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,308
Do you want to do something?
I'm not going to class.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,596
- Like what?
- I don't know.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,753
Feed you some donuts.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,831
Feed me donuts?

53
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,157
Oh nice, just make a
fat joke, freak!

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,198
I'm gonna lock it.
Watch the gates.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,517
Alright fellas. Stand up
for the count.

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,152
Alright morning ladies, morning.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,359
Is it a meeting?
Would you like his voicemail?

58
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,870
He played a poker
game last night.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,439
Wait.

60
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,359
Nirhof?

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,799
Nardela?

62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,792
Listen, who are the new guys?

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,072
Well we got a Bogart, he transferred
from upstate and a Nardela

64
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,278
Yeah, Nardela, who's is she?

65
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,391
It's the same old thing, man.

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,716
Grand theft auto, out with
coke with attempt to sell.

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,717
Done 3 out 5 at the South Court.

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,751
Pile him up on us
due to overcrowding.

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,474
It says here, that his parole is provisional.

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,796
Be released to a closest living relative.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,911
Yeah, he's gonna do 30 days on the outside...

72
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,032
if he had a family member who
would've claimed his sorry grand theft ass.

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,709
He said, he's gotta finish
out the rest of his town.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,195
That was a tough break.
-- He will get out eventually.

75
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,914
And then he can go back
to boosting Ferrari's.

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,588
Well, it says it was an Impala.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,237
Who boost Impala's?

78
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,590
Stealing the wrong kind of car.

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,994
Hey, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

80
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,798
How's my future college grad?

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,399
Fine. Whatever.

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,876
Listen. Your mom wants to know
what you wanna do all week.

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,876
All week?

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,031
Yeah, you know, for your spring break.

85
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,557
Oh, right.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,956
Did you make other plans
or something? You forget?

87
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,311
No, of course not.
I just, have work...

88
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,152
Well, bring your books. Take the
six o'clock and I'll pick you up.

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,470
You don't have to do that...

90
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,593
I know I don't have to do that
but I wanna do it because I love you.

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,392
I'll pick you up.

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,719
I love you too.

93
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,915
Blue shirt, you're on.

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,114
I'm losing the whole week full of shifts.
Forgot about spring break.

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,432
Why don't you take a vacation
like the other kids?

96
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,954
You don't have to come, dad.
I could've have rented a car service.

97
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,630
Scholarships don't pay for car service.
They pay for your education.

98
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,990
Did you bring your books?

99
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,757
No.

100
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,110
Don't you got to study or nothing?

101
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,594
Fine. Whatever. Dad.

102
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,719
Well, you know, I'm just concerned
that you don't fall behind in your studies.

103
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,670
Stop, dad

104
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,275
- Yeah, I'm concerned about your education, you know
- Stop, dad!

105
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,996
You got yourself like 20 feet in front of
you and you can stop like over there

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,715
and you got still 20 feet. Keep this thing out.
Get this piece of junk out of here.

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,869
Just get it out of here.
Get in your car.

108
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,590
Well, that's great Vince, beautiful!
A thing of beauty!

109
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,756
Yeah, you like it, huh. I did it on purpose.
I knew you'd like it so much.

110
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,436
We're just having a sale in White Plains.
We should go tomorrow.

111
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,516
Sure.

112
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,757
Maybe we'll go to the Botanical Gardens.
Vinnie said he wanted to go.

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,916
I, what?
- To the botanical gardens.

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,588
Botanical Gardens?

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,315
You're serious about going
to the botanical gardens?

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,308
I'm just saying there are much more
interesting things that we could do.

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,435
We can tie ourselves to the couch and watch
Cartoon Network for 48 hours straight or something like that.

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,111
And maybe afterwards you know,
we could take a tour of the zip lock bag factory.

119
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,435
That will be fun.

120
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,158
Vinnie, shut up.

121
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,715
You shut up Vivian, seriously.

122
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,195
Shut up, man.

123
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,433
My heart, my heart, somebody call an ambulance.
I need help. I need help.

124
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,550
That's enough.

125
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,830
So when's he leaving this
phase of stupid adolescence?

126
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,758
Never, he's never leaving high school.

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,679
coz he thinks he's too smart
to go to any of his classes.

128
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,716
To get an "A".
Oh sweet! I got an "A".

129
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,674
I'm having so much fun looking
at this letter on a piece of paper.

130
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,279
5 more of this letter
on this piece of paper...

131
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,750
...and I can get a 4.0 GPA average.

132
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,714
For what? So I can grow up and
become another meaningless...

133
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,679
Prison guard? Like your father
who also does not have a college degree.

134
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,437
Nice.

135
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,471
That's not what I was gonna say but...

136
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,675
Excuse me.

137
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,394
First of all, it's a correctional officer

138
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,716
and you know what happens
if you don't go to college?

139
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,518
You wind up answering phones for a living.

140
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,278
That's nice for you,
if you wanna hear that kind of stuff.

141
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,396
I went to Ianto.

142
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,989
Two years on Ianto which is
not exactly a Harvard degree.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,629
Well, if I hadn't gotten pregnant
I would've gotten my degree.

144
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,671
Great, mom. So I supposed
that ties the game.

145
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,711
Do not spoil my college degree.

146
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,036
I'm just saying if I hadn't gotten pregnant
I would've had a degree.

147
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,392
Yeah, but you wouldn't have hers.
So what? Degree, you daughter?

148
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,352
We all know what you're saying.

149
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,954
Where are you going?
- I got a poker game.

150
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,749
Play hard, pops.
- Shut up, Vinnie.

151
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,958
My life is falling apart.
It's all crumbling.

152
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,991
Louder, I can't hear you.

153
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,395
I need to know
you love me.

154
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,515
I...

155
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,999
Say it.

156
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,509
Jesus Christ.

157
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,357
Yes.

158
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,759
I love you.

159
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,520
Wait a minute, why
did you need to pause here?

160
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,473
What were all those pauses for?
What were they?

161
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,510
What do you mean?

162
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,156
You said 2 lines and I
counted 4 pauses in 2 lines.

163
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,635
Why do you need a pause
before you say, "what"?

164
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,389
Oh, he's stalling for time.
- Why? I mean does he love her or does he not love her?

165
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,997
He does love her.
- So what the hell you need to pause for? Listen.

166
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,433
We have the Collar Moratorium on pauses.

167
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,232
Five years of my life is going out the window...

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,635
...listening to pauses in this room.
I can't do it anymore.

169
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,996
So we gotta cut out the pauses.

170
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,277
In 2000 years of theatre history

171
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,152
you'll never find anybody pausing.

172
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,794
The only pause - they either
or they listen.

173
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,998
They did their acting while they were talking.

174
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,199
All of a sudden, Marlon Brando comes
in to the picture about 45, 50 years ago.

175
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,470
And everybody says:
"Oh my God, the man is a genius."

176
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,993
Did you see him thinking?

177
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,159
Did you see Brando in the fugitive kind?
Anybody see that?

178
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,233
Somebody asked Brando
what his name is.

179
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,034
He's gonna think about it.

180
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,593
Why does he have to think about that?

181
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,791
Takes me half an hour
to get back to the guy.

182
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,879
It's not acting and
it's not thinking. It's just...

183
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,717
well, it's just bullshit.
No more pauses!

184
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,479
If you wanna think, think in
the privacy of your own heart.

185
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,636
Otherwise, very nice work.
Very good.

186
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,196
Okay, everybody up. Stretch.
Nice deep stretch.

187
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,275
I can't talk right now.

188
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,751
I don't know maybe Monday.

189
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,115
Just give my shift to Autumn.

190
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,113
Alright bye.

191
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,478
Who was that?

192
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,149
Work.

193
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,070
And you, and you...
Okay.

194
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,472
All the people I've mentioned turn
left and face your new partner.

195
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,629
Go on, say hello.

196
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,115
Hi, I'm Molly Charlsworth.
- Hi, Vince Rizzo.

197
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,436
Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

198
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,154
Your assignment for next week is...

199
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,669
to find the most embarrassing...

200
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,270
the most unspeakable thing you can think of...
your secret of secrets...

201
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,551
and you're gonna share it
with you new partner.

202
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,035
So what are you gonna do
with your partner's secret?

203
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,957
You're gonna use to find the courage...

204
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,918
to dramatize your own secret
which you've been trying to hide...

205
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,837
within an inch of your lives...

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,150
and you're gonna present
it to us next week...

207
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,915
in the form of a monologue
with no pauses. Is that clear?

208
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,753
Good. Any questions?

209
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,792
Very good. Good class!

210
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,112
So then to get her money in her room...

211
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,754
you said your father didn't get
himself, he just tried to kill your mother.

212
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,189
Only, my mother was away
and my father was a drunk.

213
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,959
It's when their wedding
put an end, come to life.

214
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,153
So my brother and I went to stay with
my aunt on her plantation in Hawaii...

215
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,314
And my brother turned to
opium byproducts.

216
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,792
And I got shackled off to so dusty and
best forgotten European boarding schools.

217
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,830
Wow.

218
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,238
What happened to your brother?

219
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,555
Oh God, no, I'm sorry...

220
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,957
It's just not very useful
for these purposes.

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,868
You see, the problem is I've told
this secret about a million times.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,195
I've auditioned with it, in fact...

223
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,550
So it's your turn, Vince
and I'm stuck.

224
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,638
I don't know. Is it possible
that I don't have one?

225
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,829
No.

226
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,153
That would make far too healthy
towards being an actor.

227
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,711
Fat Chicks Bronx New York

228
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,238
Come on, think.

229
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,549
Well, for one thing...
I mean, right here...

230
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,117
my wife right now thinks that
I got a poker game tonight.

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,352
You mean, instead of telling her
you've enrolled in an acting class...

232
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,750
you told her you're out gambling.

233
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,553
Is that better?

234
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,319
Well, it's kinda hard to
explain, but yeah.

235
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,159
You see, my wife she wouldn't go...

236
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,829
she wouldn't go for the fact
that I wanna be an actor.

237
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,190
How very refreshing!

238
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,552
Yeah, I guess.

239
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,518
Come on, tell it to me.

240
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,390
Like you were confessing it.

241
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,957
I am Vince Rizzo, you asked
me about my worst secret...

242
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,078
my most personal secret.

243
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,869
Well, my wife she thinks I got
a poker game tonight...

244
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,033
...and it's bullshit.

245
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,199
What do you mean?
You could do worse?

246
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,198
Yeah, try me.

247
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,632
I hardly know you.

248
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,836
I know, isn't it lovely?

249
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,160
I just met my son.

250
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,075
Where?

251
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,239
In the facility where I work,
I'm a correctional officer.

252
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,879
You're a prison guard?

253
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,471
Well, sort of...
Yeah.

254
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,358
And how old is he, you're son?
- He's 24.

255
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,948
His name is Tony.

256
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,959
Tony Nardela.

257
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,352
This is brilliant.
How did you recognize him?

258
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,948
Well, his name it just popped
right out from the rap sheet.

259
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,913
You know, Nardela because
that was his mom, mom's name.

260
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,073
and he was born in Campton, New Jersey
which is where she lived.

261
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,432
I wasn't actually there
with them coz I took off.

262
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,950
Have you ever told your
current wife about him?

263
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,713
Or about his mother?
- No.

264
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,872
Or about any of it?

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,150
I always meant to, but...

266
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,600
I could never find the right time.

267
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,431
He's really handsome.

268
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,913

278
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,076
My wife, she's a fighter,
she's tough...

279
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,559
she has very firm opinions on things.

280
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,319
You just wanna make sure
she's fighting on your side.

281
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,516
Wow, she sounds like the real thing.

282
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,150
Oh yeah, she's the real thing.
And she looks great too.

283
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,511
She's very beautiful.
But you know, lately...

284
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,316
somewhat it's like we're
not friends anymore.

285
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,833
The reappearance of your secret
lovechild might well provide a solution.
- How?

286
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,754
He'll provide a dangerous
symbol of your own virility.

287
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,838
She'll be reminded of all the things
that attracted her to you to begin with...

288
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,754
You see, the Vincent
she never really knew...

289
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,878
Is the Vincent she seeks
or she wants back.

290
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,435
Does that make any sense?
- No, but you know...

291
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,795
women are emotionally incoherent.

292
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,190
It's the most defining characteristic.

293
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,557
I do some of my best work by a cellular.

294
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,350
Call me, Vincent but
only on a win.

295
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,951
Good night.

296
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,590
I was thinking as you know, being a
Saturday night and all and Vivian's here...

297
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,679
Why don't we have a big
home cook dinner tonight?

298
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,673
Big, nice, big.
- Yeah sure, like I do every Saturday night.

299
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,360
Yeah, but like you know,
something special.

300
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,513
Like for a real special occasion
or something special.

301
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,238
You want balloons or something?

302
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,635
No, I don't want balloons or something.
I'm just saying something nice.

303
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,753
When don't I make it nice?
- Make something nicer.
Make it yourself!

304
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,396
The great communicator.

305
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,149
You went outside last night?

306
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,509
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,116
I did heroine with a bunch of
prostitutes at the Plaza Hotel.

308
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,436
I'm thinking of becoming a pimp.

309
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,995
Good. I'll see you later.

310
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,398
My name is Vince Rizzo
Correctional Officer 426.

311
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,668
Says here you made provisional parole
but you got no family to be released to.

312
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,035
Yeah, that's life.

313
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,310
You got a mother named Nen.
- Yeah.

314
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,595
5 foot 2, red headed.

315
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,517
Yeah.

316
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,034
How is she doing?

317
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,471
Not so good. She's dead.

318
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,313
About 4 years ago.

319
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,313
I'm sorry to hear that.

320
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,630
Why? You know her?

321
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,478
Yeah, I know her.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,753
Anything else?
- Yeah, there's something else.

323
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,668
I spoke to Warden Amboy.

324
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,637
You're gonna be released to me.

325
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,595
You're gonna be in my personal
care for the next 30 days.

326
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,308
I live in Le Bronx.
Get the prisoner ready.

327
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,672
Can I ask you like why
I'm chained to a Ford?

328
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,555
I'm gonna unchain you, Tony
but first I gotta tell you something.

329
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,950
See this house here?

330
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,355
That's my home.

331
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,233
My grandfather built this home
and I share it with my family.

332
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,556
Well, you got them chained
up in the house too?

333
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,313
You're gonna get real nice food...

334
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,431
and a real nice place to live
for the first time in 3 years.

335
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,511
So you better behave yourself.

336
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,717
And all these, because you
knew my bitch mother.

337
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,708
Well, I got to admit your mom
can be difficult sometimes but...

338
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,792
but she was also...

339
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,351
drunk and a whore.

340
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,954
Why do you call her that?

341
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,913
She used to punish me
when I booze in cases of Vodka

342
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,957
from the liquor store I worked
at by screwing my friends

343
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,191
which makes her
drunk and a whore.

344
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,158
Don't you have any
fun memories of her?

345
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,796
Well, she was always around,
my father left before I was born.

346
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,834
What do you know about him?
- He's dead.

347
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,275
That's too bad.

348
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,836
The only thing that's too
bad is that I didn't get a chance...

349
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,076
to visit his deathbed and
dance in his ugly face

350
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,792
for leaving me with that bitch.

351
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,069
Okay, let's go!

352
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,158
I'll go with a handcuff?
- I'll unchain you in a minute.

353
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,999
I don't want you running away before I show
you what kind of setup I did for you.

354
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,310
Run away, why would I do that?

355
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,437
You said this was a house.

356
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,758
This is it.

357
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,237
I started fixing it a couple of years ago
but I got busy with other things.

358
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,075
Here's the deal: You're gonna
help me put a bathroom in here.

359
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,036
Excuse me?

360
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,629
A bathroom. My wife always wanted
a bathroom and as I figured...

361
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,711
you know, I saw in your sheet
you're a handy man.

362
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,310
30 days you build a bathroom with me.
Once you're through, I'll pay you a fair wage

363
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,717
You can go wherever the hell you want
with a few bucks in your pocket. That's the deal.

364
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,032
How am I supposed to build
a bathroom with handcuffs on me?

365
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,398
Don't go running away from me, Tony.

366
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,759
Coz if you do, I'm gonna personally
come after you. Understand me?

367
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,076
I'll throw your ass back in the cage.

368
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,396
And this time they ain't gonna be kidding.

369
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,955
They're gonna put you away
for a long stretch, you understand me?

370
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,679
Yeah, whatever.

371
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,192
Yeah, whatever.

372
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,350
Why don't you try: "Okay, Vince
I promise you that"?

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,833
Okay Vince, I promise you that.

374
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,838
Why don't you try...

375
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,075
"Thank you Vince for getting
my ass out of the cage."

376
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,832
Spit it out.

377
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,909
Thanks for getting me out of the cage.
- You're welcome.

378
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,549
And don't be talking shit about your
mother she wasn't perfect but she was...

379
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,193
...she was a good lay.

380
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,073
Yeah, whatever.

381
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,393
Shit, my wife.

382
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,034
Is that what you call her?
Shit, my wife.

383
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,152
I don't smoke.
- Yeah, I can tell.

384
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,191
Whatever you do just don't
mention the prison thing.

385
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,317
Just say we're old friends.

386
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,272
Are we in a bowling team together?

387
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,438
My daughter's back from college
so you better take it easy.

388
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,796
And don't mention that I knew
you mother. It's bad news.

389
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,076
I'll tell you when you can come out.

390
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,719
Anybody home?
- I'm here.

391
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,675
So is dad, he's out back,
handcuffed to some biker dude.

392
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,996
...been back there for quite
some time. Bullshit.

393
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,397
You bring some filthy
biker into my house

394
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,990
without even so much as asking me.
- He's not a biker, he's a nice young man...

395
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,435
he's gonna be working for his board.
- Where did you meet this guy anyway?

396
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,995
He's getting out of jail in a month.
I told them I will take responsibility for him.

397
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,633
Oh my God, Vince.

398
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,559
What? You just pick that con at random
and bring him into my house?

399
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,712
I don't pick no con at random,
I happened to know his mother.

400
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,519
What?

401
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,156
His mother, I happened
to know his mother.

402
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,351
What do you mean?
Who was she?

403
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,398
Mom, now you think he never knew
any woman before you? Calm down.

404
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,239
Are you serious?
- I knew his mother. She was like a...

405
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,351
No! No! No!

406
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,038
...because it's my house!
- He cannot stay here, Vince!
Do you understand me?

407
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,273
Before we go on, I'd like
to thank my beautiful wife, Joycie

408
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,472
for this special dinner
that she prepared.

409
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,597
Yeah, it looks great, Mom!

410
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,352
Thank you.

411
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,717
I like to welcome
Tony to our table.

412
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,113
Good times ahead. Nothing but
good, sweet, breezy times.

413
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,838
Plus the food is gotta be
like at least marginally...

414
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,753
better than that shit
they serve in jail, right?

415
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,634
What's the matter with you?

416
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,633
My peptic ulcer!

417
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,510
You have to watch it!
-- Vinnie, shut up.

418
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,272
No, yo, you shut up, get off my ass.
What're you gonna do?

419
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,116
Vince tells me that he was
friends with your mother.

420
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,428
Yeah, a long time ago, I guess.

421
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,954
I guess so.

422
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,510
Well, I never heard about it.

423
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,270
It was because...it was
before we met, sweetie.

424
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,231
He says she was a very nice
woman, good looking too, I bet.

425
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,708
Here we go.

426
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,912
Mom, Dad's right, why don't
we just be upfront here...

427
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,908
come out with it, just ask him
if he had sex with this woman.

428
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,793
Apologize to me.

429
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,558
That's my brain tumor.

430
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,598
Well, he does have a point.

431
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,514
With all due respect, it is
what you were getting at.

432
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,832
I don't care if you had
sex with her or not.

433
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,632
Why are you two
gaining up on me?

434
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,590
Come on, Joycie...

435
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,877
you know, after 20 years I know
where you're going before even you do.

436
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,277
Well, that must be very
boring for you, Vince. Really.

437
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,954
Who knew that I was failing to keep
you entertained all these years.

438
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,350
Mom, he didn't mean it like that.
- You're taking his side too now?

439
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,032
I'm not taking any sides.
I'm just saying...

440
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,519
You know, dad says some things
in stupid ways sometimes.

441
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,436
In a stupid way? Now your dad is
stupid for some reason all of a sudden?

442
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,392
I meant you said it
in a stupid way.

443
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,794
You just said that I
was sounding stupid.

444
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,237
You might talk to your colleagues,
to your college friends but...

445
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,710
you don't talk to your father like that.
- Well, you blame her for a real education.

446
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,388
I'm not saying anything about it,
I'm just saying she can't talk to me...

447
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,074
Why? Do you have to bring college into it?
- No, you brought college into it!

448
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,874
Stop, guys!
Just stop.

449
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,718
She's telling I'm stupid in the
front of the dining room table.

450
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,678
Dad, stop!

451
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,996
Want some cheese?
- Yeah, sure.

452
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,997
Okay Vivian, I've got
to ask you a question.

453
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,635
What?

454
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,317
Are your breast continuing
to grow? Because...

455
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,034
and this is to my endeavor, way bigger.
- What are you doing?

456
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,390
How dare you talk
to your sister like that?

457
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,912
Get in my room? Pretty lame, mom.
It's a little old school.

458
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,874
Don't talk to your
mother like that.

459
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,995
Go to your room, right now.
- I like this family. This is nice.

460
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,949
My room's got everything.
Everything I need is in my room.

461
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,475
Hey, you want me to get up?
I'm getting up.

462
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,116
It's not my punishment.
I'm done. I'm done. I'm leaving.

463
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,677
Unbelievable.

464
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,956
What?

465
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,831
Vince?

466
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,717
What?

467
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,914
He does have a point there, sweetie.
I mean...

468
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,156
It does seem to be getting
larger in that area.

469
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,236
Jesus, dad!

470
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,908
What's the matter with you?
Where're you going?

471
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,593
That girl buries her head
in her books, 18 hours a day.

472
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,109
She comes home for a little
quality family time...

473
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,593
and you gotta go and screw it up.

474
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,598
What's screwed up? I'm just saying they're
getting larger. 'twas a compliment.

475
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,550
Oh my God!

476
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,353
What's the matter with you guys?
- Inappropriate!

477
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,233
I'm inappropriate? I'm the guy here
who's trying to hold this thing together.

478
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,517
What's the matter with you guys, huh?
The hell with this.

479
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,111
The hell with all of you's.

480
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,477
Dinner was great.
Thank you.

481
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,799
Hey, Molly.
Yeah, it's me. Vince.

482
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,189
I'm calling you on a whim.

483
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,514
Spring break over?

484
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,555
Just out here to watch the show.
Take off early tonight, split a shit with me.

485
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,275
Highly unlikely. Agent
Invasion is out of force.

486
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,152
Shit, I could've cleaned up this week.

487
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,239
Have a drink.

488
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,111
My husband thinks I quit.

489
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,110
One good thing about the joint.
They don't let you smoke anymore so...

490
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,598
I quit inside.

491
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,394
Being in prison and
not being able to smoke?

492
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,437
That's like being in jail.

493
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,633
Join me.

494
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,672
You got to tell them, I mean...

495
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,713
...the longer it goes about not knowing who
you really are, the greater her sense of betrayal.

496
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,592
And she's been betrayed enough.

497
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,350
Yeah, and it all started
when I walked off.

498
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,311
No, don't do that.

499
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,876
Things come to self-flagellation.

500
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,437
I mean, I understand it of course.

501
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,190
It was one of the Catholic of you and
everything but you're beyond it.

502
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,197
You've opened up your
home to a convicted felon.

503
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,636
You'd shown him huge trust...

504
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,751
by leaving him alone
there with your family.

505
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,711
Oh, Jesus, that's all I need.

506
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,229
No, because he's your
flesh and blood.

507
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,874
If you can't trust your own blood
then what the hell can you trust.

508
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,154
Vince, come on, it's time for you to just
take the final step and fill his part right there.

509
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,633
He started that boatshed 3 years ago...

510
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,593
with enough wooden junk
to build a forest.

511
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,718
This is gonna be his new career,
building things.

512
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,560
He gets discouraged when
things take too long.

513
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,350
Like more than an hour.

514
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,115
And him? and his poker games.

515
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,954
Does he really think
I'd buy that crap?

516
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,391
- What is it in "New Screen and Stage"?

517
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,637
The Wall Street Journal
is staging actors.

518
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,511
You prove yours, that's it.
A new open course...

519
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,916
Parts that are never get
and projects that are never made.

520
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,232
For instance...

521
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,072
Here, open call, male, 30-50

522
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,189
working class type,
no agency rep required.

523
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,069
Auditions will be held Monday,
9 AM, Barret St, Armond.

524
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,753
That would be a good one for you.

525
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,509
...Yeah, no kidding.

526
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,115
Does it also say, if you got
no age, you're not qualified?

527
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,316
Does it say no talent?

528
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,630
So what happens, you go to
that street and then what happens?

529
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,640
You've never been to an audition before?
- No.

530
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,629
Oh Vincent, it's dreadful.

531
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,549
What?

532
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,798
Okay, so, you walk in...

533
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,830
you wait in a room crowded with the faces
that look vaguely familiar in an explicit way.

534
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,350
They mark you in, they stare
at you, they hate you.

535
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,870
You sing and dance and throw a
baton, show off all the talents..

536
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,070
that once thrilled your mother and father.

537
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,795
They make faces, sometimes very rarely.
They ask you a question.

538
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,792
Then you're dismissed
and you go home for the night.

539
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,992
Content not peeing there.

540
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,712
Sounds terrifying.

541
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,271
But having said all that...

542
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,597
you really should go for this one.
It sounds perfect for you, come on.

543
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,434
Thank you very much.
You walked me off a cliff.

544
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,472
<i>Welcome my new fat-friendly fan.</i>

545
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,909
<i>You're now officially
a member of my club.</i>

546
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,430
<i>If you see me out at the BBW
Function in the New York Metro area</i>

547
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,118
<i>you can tell me
you're a special member</i>

548
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,832
<i>by saying our secret word:</i>

549
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,757
<i>"Botero"</i>

550
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,677
When you think about it, Vincent,
acting is one of the strangest things

551
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,392
a person can possibly choose to do.

552
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,399
Pretending to be someone else
who was dreamed up by some third party.

553
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,478
It's like agreeing to be a marionette.

554
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,757
Why do you act?

555
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,956
Rarely, what other profession could have
committed my sort of behavior problems.

556
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,111
Yeah, sort of like they pay
you for being a professional schooler.

557
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,915
Perfect.

558
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,840
I grew up with a mother
and no father.

559
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,149
And my mother hated my father so much...

560
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,115
for leaving. Then, she took it
out on me because I reminded her of him.

561
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,191
I didn't even know him.
It's hilarious.

562
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,515
Upstairs, my son's room
has a bunch of sweaters

563
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,949
Second door on your left.

564
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,954
Thank you.

565
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,594
Botero?

566
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,031
Hello, who's there?

567
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,593
So you thought any more
about your secret?

568
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,359
All the time.

569
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,349
For you to have a land of secrets.

570
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,232
Yeah, skies.

571
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,189
That'll be very difficult for you
to decide which one is the best.

572
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,470
Am I ever gonna get a chance to hear it?

573
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,515
I don't mean to press you
or anything, it's just that...

574
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,553
I'm feeling a little nervous
since we have a class in 3 days and...

575
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,432
...I just wanna be helpful.

576
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,358
Where do you live?

577
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,188
Le Bronx.

578
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,878
No thanks.

579
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,195
What?

580
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,512
Forget it, soak it in the ash.
I'm sorry.

581
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,198
I'm sure Le Bronx is lovely.

582
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,437
My part overly is,
the other part not so much.

583
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,155
I lived in a place called City Island.
It's an old fishing village.

584
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,992
Really?

585
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,278
City Island

586
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,878
For two worlds standing
apart really from each other.

587
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,796
City: so short and abrupt and definite.

588
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,997
and Island: it's subtle, unknown.

589
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,116
..and with a silent "S".

590
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,432
I would never...

591
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,668
thought about it in those terms,
but yeah, it's a great spot.

592
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,871
If you live there, you go up there...

593
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,920
you would never think
about moving somewhere else.

594
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,474
Good night, Tony.
Pleasant dreams.

595
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,198
Good night, Mrs. Rizzo.

596
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,835
Joyce.
- Mrs. Rizzo is Vince's mom.

597
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,434
That's it.

598
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,155
What?

599
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,472
It's my secret.

600
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,919
No, not yet.

601
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,359
I needed it to stay mine
just for a little bit longer.

602
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,240
Once you know, it's no
longer treated a secret.

603
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,710
Be at the moment when it's obvious.

604
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,472
Will you keep it with you?

605
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,399
Yeah, of course.

606
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,479
Vince.
-What?

607
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,152
What a wonderful time
to not disappear.

608
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,477
Where were you last night honey?

609
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,238
Friends.

610
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,477
Where are you going?

611
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,433
Beach.

612
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,751
Okay, here's what I'm thinking...

613
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,436
take the pipe and we'll run
it right through here.

614
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,758
We angle it off, we chase the steps up
the hill and tap it to the main line.

615
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,190
Feels good, son, don't you?

616
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,312
You know, my grandfather built this
house way before I was born.

617
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,159
Yeah, you told me.

618
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,590
He came from the old country.
He became a fish scaler.

619
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,030
Yeah?
- Yeah, him and his brother.

620
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,310
Couple of young mussel suckers.

621
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,878
How's that?

622
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,994
City Island has an old custom.

623
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,432
If you come from somewhere else
you're known as a "mussel sucker."

624
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,669
But if you're born and raised here
like myself, you're a "clam digger"

625
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,832
Clam digger.

626
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,392
Mussel sucker.

627
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,110
Hey, you wanna see something?
- No.

628
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,719
Really.
- Are you sure?

629
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,955
Go away.

630
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,196
If could mess with your head like forever.

631
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,956
I'd wanna see it.

632
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,993
Where did you get that?

633
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,717
Dad hides it in the bathroom.

634
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,720
Hey, relax, relax.
It's just me.

635
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,151
You scared the hell out of me.

636
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,033
What's that?

637
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,878
What?
- That.

638
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,156
It's between you and me, okay.

639
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,919
It's an open call for a movie tomorrow.

640
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,273
So?

641
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,718
Ever since I was a little kid
I wanted to become an actor.

642
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,150
I thought it was something I could do.

643
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,393
I've been taking acting classes
over there in the city.

644
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,795
Nobody knows. Joyce don't know.
Nobody knows.

645
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,838
It's kinda stupid.
She thinks I got a poker game.

646
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,871
Well, what you really had
going on is an acting class?

647
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,433
I got an acting class.

648
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,554
Another friend of mine who goes to the classes,
explaining to me what it's like going on auditions.

649
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,233
Doesn't sound like it's for me.
- You should give it a shot if that's what you wanna do.

650
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,033
It's what I wanna do
but I'm no actor.

651
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,878
Not for real anyway.

652
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,554
But anyone can act
if they have to.

653
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,831
What do you mean anybody
can act if they...

654
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,520
you can't act if you have to.
You gotta study that.

655
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,438
A lot like..like when I got to South court.

656
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,675
I figured that acting more psycho
than everyone else when I was younger.

657
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,036
Had to watch out for myself.

658
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,957
So what did you do?

659
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,194
I went at the ugliest guy I could find.

660
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,156
I think I'm pissed off of you.
And I don't know why.

661
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,679
Do I need a reason?

662
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,392
You said that?
- Shut up! I'm talking to you.

663
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,511
Give me top ten reason you're a
piece of shit and I'll let you know...

664
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,274
when something rings a bell,
but don't lie to me.

665
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,238
And don't figure me as one of your
sissy boys, it's gonna pay out for you.

666
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,476
You're sadly a deformed
excuse for humanity

667
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,034
posing as a piece of prison garbage.

668
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,839
And it worked.

669
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,679
That was just...acting.

670
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,556
Think about it, right.

671
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,710
Hey, that was terrific.

672
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,594
Hey, how are you doing?
I come here for the movie audition.
- Back of the line.

673
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,069
Do you know anything
about this movie here?

674
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,671
It's for Scorsese and DeNiro.

675
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,070
Where were you?
Funeral?

676
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,875
Yeah.

677
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,079
Hey yourself.

678
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,075
Yeah.

679
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,793
Yeah what?

680
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,233
Relax.

681
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,790
Botero.

682
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,395
Botero! Botero.

683
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,719
It's Botero.

684
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,955
Dude, it's Botero I wikipediad that.

685
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,988
They got the pronunciation
spelled out like, at a dictionary.

686
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,475
I'm making triple braised
baby back ribs...

687
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,999
mix grilled.

688
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,873
sweltered in steaks.

689
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,471
Do you wanna go shopping with me?

690
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,669
Yes.

691
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,431
Yes, I do actually.

692
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,592
Hey, I'm almost done with the thrash.

693
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,633
What do you want me to do next?

694
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,150
Oh I don't know.
What did Vince want done in there?

695
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,274
A toilet, wall, shower stall,
I mean, he wasn't really specific.

696
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,390
You know, we could go to a
bathroom place or something.
Pick some stuff out.

697
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,910
Well, I got no plans. I took a
day off, you know, "family time".

698
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,431
Maybe we should ask
Vince if he has any...

699
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,993
preferences.

700
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,792
Preferences for what?

701
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,269
Toilets and stuff?

702
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,153
That's funny.

703
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,239
Why is that funny?

704
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,118
You know, toilets...

705
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,430
I just wanna go back to work.
And why does this holiday even exist?

706
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,429
It's sucks, you know, my parents
were so freaking toxic. It's just...

707
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,153
I gotta get out of here.

708
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,914
I better call my husband.
- Sure.

709
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,709
No way, no way,
no way, no way...

710
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,996
No, no, no.

711
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,078
No way, no.

712
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,679
Officer Rizzo, please.

713
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,760
Yeah, I'm holding for
my husband, Officer Rizzo.

714
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,879
He called in sick?

715
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,908
Hey sweetie, how are you doing?

716
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,314
Where are you?

717
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,953
Yeah, I'm a...

718
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,998
I'm at work.
I'm on the yards.

719
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,909
Well, I was just wondering...

720
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,069
if you had a preference for toilets.

721
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,434
Toilets?

722
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,314
No preference.

723
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,591
Take Tony with you
he could help.

724
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,473
Yeah, okay. Good idea.
I'll take Tony.

725
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,989
Oh, Vince...

726
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,116
you know, how every cop
always leaves his house with a gun?

727
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,878
Well, my husband swears...

728
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,355
that every car should have
a good pair of handcuffs.

729
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,636
Like he's Joe Justice.

730
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,119
Orchard Beach.

731
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,037
Have you ever been?

732
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,072
I actually considered killing myself.

733
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,955
I considered, you know,
chop off a sexual organ in defiance.

734
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,832
I just gotta to tell you, though
it's my thing...

735
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,238
I need to feed a girl
like a lot of food.

736
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,952
You're a classic feeder, Vinnie.

737
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,718
You gain pleasure by
giving pleasure.

738
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,318
Who was the girl in the
park you were with yesterday?

739
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,310
Oh, that's Sheryl,
she's just a friend from school.

740
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,352
She's a sweet lady.
Try to love her.

741
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,473
So Tony, you do anything else besides...

742
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,118
Boosting a car?

743
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,918
I also get stuff...

744
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,036
all up at the gas station.

745
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,070
Robbed a pharmacy,
couple of jewelry stores.

746
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,830
Are you scared of me?

747
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,230
Oh, yeah.

748
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,756
Sir, follow us.
Sir, this way.

749
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,717
Can you make a line
in the order I called you?

750
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,592
And you, you join us.

751
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,077
Sir, you too. You.
You in the back. This way.

752
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,869
And him.

753
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,310
And you, back of the line.

754
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,391
Thank you very much.
Go home. Come on.

755
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,033
It's okay Tony, it's not like
I'm doing this forever or nothing.

756
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,668
I don't care.
It doesn't matter to me.

757
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,153
Let me ask you if he
wasn't fooling around...

758
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,598
No, no, you don't worry about that.
I mean, these decisions I make are mine.

759
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,274
But I mean, what if he hadn't?

760
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,711
Hadn't what?

761
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,791
Made what you thought he made.

762
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,029
You're having another feeling.

763
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,679
What other feeling?

764
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,319
Like you don't like me?

765
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,953
Definitely not the case.

766
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,390
Good.

767
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,713
Vince Rizzo.

768
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,749
Follow me.

769
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,595
Relax yourself.

770
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,672
Step on the mark.

771
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,679
State yourself.

772
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,111
Say what?

773
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,196
Look into the camera
and say your name.

774
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,909
Oh yeah, Vincent Rizzo
Correctional Officer 426.

775
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,195
No, Joyce, I can't, I can't.

776
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,716
It's not that I don't wanna, I do.

777
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,836
It's not nothing.

778
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,473
Except your husband...

779
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,235
maybe he's got something going on
in his life, maybe it's not a poker game.

780
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,437
but it's doesn't got to be
with another woman, you know.

781
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,030
Really?

782
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,036
Like what he's taking a class?
Please.

783
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,834
Whenever you're ready.

784
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,836
Excuse me?

785
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:55,910
Start.

786
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,638
Oh, do the thing.

787
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,398
I'm sorry, are you doing
a Marlon Brando impression?

788
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,990
No.

789
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,358
Okay, let's just try again
in your own voice.

790
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,714
So make no mistake Joey!
From now on out, I'm watching you.

791
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,110
What you do, who you do.
Watch it!

792
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,596
Coz Frankie Gunucci has
eyes in the back of his head.

793
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,392
In the back of his head?

794
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,075
In the back? Should it be like
I have eyes in the back...

795
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,594
Thank you, Mr. Rizzo.

796
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,358
Excuse me?
- Thank you.

797
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,796
That's it?

798
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,954
Hold on one second.

799
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,069
Absolutely.

800
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,109
Absolutely.

801
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,435
I'll try.

802
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,908
Are you a professional actor?

803
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,310
No, I'm a correctional officer.

804
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,239
Okay, could you come back?
Come back to the mark.

805
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,191
You're a correctional officer.
Is that a prison guard?

806
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,799
Prison guard?

807
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,711
Yeah, I guess you can call it that.

808
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,513
Okay, and where do you work?

809
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,196
Dalegrove Correctional Facility, Westchester.

810
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,756
Is that like one of those
Country Club prisons?

811
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,391
Country Club prisons?
I'm sorry...

812
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,637
...but I wouldn't call it that.
Not by a long shot.

813
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,230
You want me to talk about this?
- Sure.

814
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,948
We got guys in there that if
you see inside their minds

815
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,072
and see what they're thinking,
you wouldn't be thinking of no golf game.

816
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,999
Okay, well, tell me more about what you do?
What's a typical day?

817
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,872
A typical day is no such animal.

818
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,672
I mean, some days
I walk and talk, you know...

819
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,155
you do the count.
You send the guys out in the yard.

820
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,590
But other days.
Other days are trouble.

821
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,479
The gangs are out of control,
you gotta lock down...

822
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,035
The boys and the girls,
they go in a little dispatch.

823
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,596
Kinda like the real world but
here, they jump your bones.

824
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,315
And sometimes I see a new recruit come in
and I'm looking at him I'm going...

825
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,035
"I got two words for you: Bye, bye."

826
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,994
Coz you're not gonna be the same guy coming in
as you are going out, you know what I'm saying.

827
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,955
Okay so, you know, that scene we just
read just do it again in your own words.

828
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,309
Not using the...

829
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,353
Throw the script away.
- Improvisation, it's like an improvisation.

830
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,474
How would you say it?

831
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,438
This Joey Zambuli character...

832
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,995
he thinks he got the goods
on the Frankie Gunucci...

833
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,838
which is the guy I play, right?

834
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,235
Which makes Zambuli like the worst kind of creep.

835
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,475
Why do you say that?

836
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,194
Well, you know, where I work,
everything is about power.

837
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,998
Zambuli they try to intimidate
the new recruits when they come in.

838
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,794
And if you're a new recruit and
you don't get in their face right away

839
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,275
and hold your ground, they're
gonna have you on all fours...

840
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,075
...sucking cement.
You know what sucking cement means, right?

841
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,633
I know what that means.

842
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,752
What do you do with guys like that?

843
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,479
What I would do is I would pretend that...

844
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,671
Bang!, right up, right from the start
when they come to me...

845
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,953
I pretend I'm more psycho than they are
you know, get them off guard.

846
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,789
Look at this guy, get right in his face
and give him a little intimidation like that.

847
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,870
And you say: "I'm pissed off of you,
and I don't know why. Do I got a reason?"

848
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,789
Something like that.

849
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,394
Look right into the camera
and talk to Joey Zambuli.

850
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,434
Like if Joey Zambuli is in the camera.
- Uh huh, and you are pissed off.

851
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,432
I don't like him
- No.

852
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,392
Yeah, I mean, he's a creep.

853
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,950
Hey Zambuli, I think I'm pissed off of you
and I don't know why. Do I got a reason?

854
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,112
Let me help you out a little bit.

855
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,958
Why don't you give me your
Top Ten Reasons why you're...

856
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,993
why you're a piece of shit.
And I'll tell you when one rings a bell.

857
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,434
Okay, go.

858
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,238
And don't lie to me!

859
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,633
You got it? Don't lie to me.

860
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,274
And don't figure me for
one of your little sissy boys.

861
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,557
That's gonna put out for you.
Whenever you ask.

862
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,833
Because I got eyes in the front of my head
and in the back of my head and in the side of my head.

863
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,555
And they all see 20:20, capiche?
Comprende?

864
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,714
You're a sadly deformed excuse
for humanity...

865
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,639
posing as some sort of prison garbage.

866
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,517
You mess with me...

867
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,475
You mess with Frankie Gunucci!
Frankie Gunucci! You lose!

868
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,596
Thank you.

869
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,756
What?

870
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,676
Thank you.

871
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,956
Yeah, you better thank me,
you piece of shit, get out of my face!

872
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,151
Get out of my face!

873
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,958
Yeah, take your eyes out
of your fucking head.

874
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,155
Thank you, Mr. Rizzo.
- Shove it up your nose you're gonna be looking like this...

875
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,875
Mr. Rizzo, thank you.
- the rest of your life.

876
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,999
Excuse me?
Oh, that's all?

877
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,556
Sorry, I got carried away.
- That's okay.

878
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,274
Thank you, that was crazy.
Pretty wild.

879
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,711
You need this?

880
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,115
No that's fine, you can keep it.
- Thank you very much.

881
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,516
That's nice. I had a good time.

882
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,754
I was walking out I was feeling
like I was gonna throw up.

883
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,831
and then she stopped me,
she brought me back in.

884
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,031
And before I knew it,
she's asking me these questions...

885
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,789
she's got me doing an improvisation
and I lost my mind.

886
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,433
It was crazy.

887
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,989
Wait.

888
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,990
You just did an improve for
Martin Scorsese's casting director.

889
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,352
Vincent, that's not everyday
garden variety audition. That's...

890
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:42,430
I mean, that's just...
You're in a... elite...

891
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,072
elite core of auditionists.

892
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,789
No, I wouldn't call that elite.
- It's amazing.

893
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,195
It was wild.

894
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,678
I mean, she had me screaming
inside the camera and I lost my mind.

895
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,589
But all to me,
it was all bullshit.

896
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,948
What do you mean?

897
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,675
Well, because I pretended as though I, you know,
that's the way I talk to the guys inside.

898
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,439
but actually that's the way my son,
Tony, talks to the guys inside.

899
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,028
No, that's so much better.

900
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,790
You corrupted someone else's experience
and filtered it in to your own personality...

901
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,150
in order to create a character.
That's not bullshit, Vincent.

902
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,679
That's acting.

903
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,552
That's acting.
You could do that in acting.

904
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,352
Yes.
- It's allowed?

905
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,869
I can't believe this has
happened to you today.

906
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,309
It was real pretty crazy,
I tell you. I kind of...

907
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,235
Yeah, this is me.

908
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,868
You want me to come back?
Did I forget something?

909
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,558
Who's this?

910
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,640
Louise from casting?

911
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,716
The producers would like
to see you reading again...

912
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,149
with some of the other actors
who've already been cast.

913
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,670
This would be, Wednesday at 2.
Can you make it?

914
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,350
Read with other actors?

915
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,274
Yes, yes, I guess yes.

916
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,073
I mean, Wednesday at 2.
I got work on Wednesday.

917
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,270
No, I don't have work on
Wednesday, Wednesday at 2?

918
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,960
It's okay, yeah, that'll be fine.
I can be there, yeah.

919
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,116
Thank you for everything, I guess.

920
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,030
You gotta go back.

921
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,634
Yeah, I guess so.

922
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,352
Vincent...
- Yeah.

923
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,268
First time out, God!
- Yeah, beginner's luck.

924
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,989
What's wrong?

925
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,236
Come on,
what's going on?

926
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,396
What?

927
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,308
No, it's super brilliant.
It's amazing.

928
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,150
You know, well, it's
all meant to be somehow

929
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,556
you know we meet, to have coffee
and tell each other secrets.

930
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,389
And for me to show you
an advert in screen stage...

931
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,158
that launches your career.

932
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,555
Yeah, I know no careers being launched yet.

933
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:02,272
You know, I'm just going back in
and I haven't even got the part yet.

934
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,914
You can't believe how amazing this is.

935
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,672
Excuse me, everybody.

936
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,036
I'm sorry to bother you but
I just want to tell you for a second...

937
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,152
about my dear friend here, Vincent Rizzo.

938
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,471
Went on his very first audition today.

939
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,431
For a Martin Scorsese film.

940
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,120
And they liked him so much...

941
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,596
that they've called him back on Wednesday.

942
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,789
And he's a prison guard.

943
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,829
Joyce.

944
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,957
I had a great time.

945
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,356
So Vincent, tell me something...

946
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,118
What're you gonna tell your wife?

947
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,792
She doesn't gonna have any idea that you
even have the tiniest little inkling of acting ambition at all.

948
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,357
No, she still knows nothing.
She still thinks a got a poker game, that's it.

949
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,869
And even if I will to tell her.
She would never believe that.

950
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,630
I mean, I have to start like, go so far back
to try to even explain when it happened...

951
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,797
and how it happened and
where are the Brando thing.

952
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,673
And I mean, no matter what I say,
I don't even know where to start.

953
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,268
What about that the truth
is not outside of the question, is it?

954
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,469
It's out of the question.

955
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,595
Can I have some chicken, please.
- Chicken, right.

956
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,951
Mind if my hands...

957
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,590
You okay honey, you need anything else?
- No, I'm good.

958
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,398
Okay, I think I got it.

959
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,555
What if you pretend
to be my manager?

960
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,195
And then you could say
you then discovered me.

961
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,754
Nice. I like it.
- Thank you very much.

962
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,952
Yes, I discovered you
in some sort of a strange way.

963
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:29,551
Like my brother's an inmate or something.
- Nice.

964
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,191
And I set you up with Martin Scorsese's
casting. It's perfect.

965
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,394
If she has any problems your wife
can come to me about them.

966
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,318
And you're okay with that?
Because, you know, she can be kind of a hurricane.

967
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,000
Wives always hate me Vincent
I'm used to it.

968
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,118
Are you ready?

969
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,072
To go to City Island?
- Now?

970
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,711
So this is it?
- Yeah.

971
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,150
I like it.
- Yeah, it's nice.

972
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,075
It's kinda like New England
by way of Washington Heights.

973
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,510
City Island Yacht and Beach Club?

974
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,551
Well, it's more like a boat yard.

975
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,877
It's got some grass and barbecues and...

976
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,599
...it's got a pier. But the views are great.

977
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,238
Can we see the views for
like just a minute?

978
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,391
Yeah, I don't see why not?

979
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,430
Excellent.

980
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,158
Every busy city needs
an island of peace.

981
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,877
And every busy soul needs
a place to propose.

982
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,109
Tell it to me again.
- What?

983
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,633
Your big secret.
- About Tony?

984
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,555
You already know the whole thing.

985
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,754
You're the only one who does know.

986
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,639
Yeah, I know, but how did it work?
How did you?...His mom and...

987
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,714
When did you know you were leaving?

988
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,068
Well, I met Nen when
I was about 19.

989
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,077
And she was older.

990
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,432
And she was kinda hot for me and
I was hot to get out of the family.

991
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,994
You know, get away from City Island.

992
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,634
We used to drink at the same
bottle of wine in Arthur Avenue.

993
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,355
Pretty soon, I started
living at her place.

994
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,915
And then that's when things
got a little complicated.

995
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,549
Next you know she was pregnant.

996
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,348
I knew by then she
was bad news for me so...

997
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,509
She said: "I knew you're leaving anyway."

998
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,114
"I'm not gonna get stuck
with nothing for myself" so...

999
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,598
That's when I know
she was having a kid.

1000
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,438
And I had to do what I have to do.

1001
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,677
Or what I thought I had to do.
I was also a kid.

1002
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,918
Anyway, I had 7500 bucks
in my pocket and I, you know...

1003
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,918
working on my father's boat
here in City Island.

1004
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,310
I was gonna use it to
go to City College...

1005
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,158
...but I gave it to her instead.

1006
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,475
And then you know,
I got into this prison stuff.

1007
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,354
I figured I need a steady income,
pension, I met Joyce...

1008
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,914
You never told anyone in your family?

1009
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,397
I don't wanna bother anybody.
It was my thing.

1010
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,357
Plus, I wasn't too proud of taking off.

1011
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,473
Leaving is never pretty
no matter how you do it.

1012
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,198
Yeah, you can say that again.

1013
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,876
Bitch!

1014
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,753
There was no one there.

1015
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,269
I hate those things.
Won't you hate those things?

1016
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,550
I'm always getting a wrong number.

1017
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,515
No, it wasn't a wrong number.

1018
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,390
It was an announcement.

1019
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,676
A ring a bell.

1020
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,272
An indication.

1021
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,509
For what?

1022
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,998
Now, Vincent.

1023
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,957
Now is the time.

1024
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,591
Have you still got it?

1025
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,397
What? Your secret?

1026
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,988
Yeah, of course.

1027
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,593
Sure?

1028
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,315
No.

1029
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,835
Yes.

1030
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,438
Who are they?

1031
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,632
My three secrets.

1032
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,078
They're beautiful.

1033
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,509
Thank you.

1034
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,074
Where are they?

1035
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,509
With my husband in Schenectady.

1036
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,231
What are they doing up there?

1037
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,358
Real question is,
what am I doing down here?

1038
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,430
That's where I'm from, Vincent.

1039
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,158
Born and raised.

1040
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,036
My father was the janitor
at the grade school...

1041
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,674
...and my mother left
home when I was 6.

1042
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,193
And their mother left
5 months ago.

1043
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,235
Why?

1044
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:02,673
To see if it was possible to
pretend the past never existed.

1045
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,117
It's not possible.

1046
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,115
Please, don't hate me, Vincent.

1047
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,997
If anyone might understand,
it would be you.

1048
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,719
What's up? Seltzer water?
- Seltzer water, please. Seltzer water.

1049
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,797
What the hell are you doing here?

1050
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,558
Yeah, well, I guess I can
ask you the same question.

1051
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,908
Does my mother know
that you have her car?

1052
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,519
Does your mother know
that you're a stripper?

1053
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,198
Give me the key.

1054
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,239
Listen, I'm not trying to make any...
- Let me have the key.

1055
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,395
You don't have it, do you?

1056
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,148
You stole my mother's car, didn't you?

1057
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,799
You're such a loser.

1058
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,993
Hi, yeah, I like to report a stolen car.

1059
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,232
Yeah, I'll hold.

1060
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,797
Why are you even here, huh?

1061
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,113
Yeah, hi, my mother's car was stolen.

1062
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,515
Yeah, license plate number, hold on...

1063
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,237
Give me that.
- Calm down!

1064
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,237
You stole my mother's car.
- And you're a stripper.

1065
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,874
Stripping isn't against the law.
- Oh, then it's okay for me to tell your parents of what you do.

1066
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,399
No, don't you dare, you loser!

1067
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,919
Bitch. Hooker!

1068
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,439
Don't call me that!
I'm not a hooker!

1069
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,551
Showing your tits for money,
what's that called, librarian?

1070
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,717
I got suspended from school, alright
and I lost my scholarship.

1071
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,518
It's just so I could
make enough money

1072
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,756
so I could go back and have to tell my parents.

1073
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,836
And I'm the loser, huh?

1074
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,957
Come here. Come here.
- Get off. What are you doing?

1075
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,753
I'm bringing your mom's car back
with you in it, you know, I really delivered.

1076
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,871
And only you know, I took it.
And only I know you work here.

1077
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,673
And that's gonna be the deal with us forever
until one of us blows it. That's how it works for us, Vivian?

1078
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,717
That's how it's gonna work for you and me.
Got it, Vivian?

1079
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,875
Take these off!

1080
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,959
Why did my father
even bring you home?

1081
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,911
I have no idea.

1082
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,356
Did something happen between you and my mom?
- No.

1083
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,599
Are you gonna tell them that...?

1084
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,551
Hey, I gave you my word, didn't I?
My word's my word.

1085
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,235
Which something you and your jerk off family
probably never even heard off.

1086
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,154
That's weird.
- What's wrong?

1087
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,198
She's not home.
Maybe she went out for some food.

1088
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,109
This is so nice.

1089
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,312
Yeah, my grandfather built this house.
He's a builder.

1090
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:34,751
Yeah, so, here's what I'm thinking.
Now, when she comes in.

1091
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,599
I'm just gonna say straight up,
I'll just look at her and say:

1092
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,230
"Joyce, it's time we gotta talk."

1093
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,719
Vincent, darling.
That's the wrong way.

1094
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,308
Women, they feel...

1095
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,440
challenged by too much honesty.

1096
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,232
No, you gotta trust me on this.

1097
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,715
After 20 years with her,
I know what I'm talking about.

1098
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,835
Vincent.
- Why?

1099
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,748
Darling, 30 years I've been
a woman. Let me handle her.

1100
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,276
Remain casual and don't mention
about anything unusual going on.

1101
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,000
Before she can even think and ask
what I'm doing here...

1102
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,436
she'll be thanking me.
For having come into your life.

1103
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,830
Hey, how are you doing?
You're home.

1104
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,758
Yeah, Vince, I'm home.

1105
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,194
Where I live.

1106
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,719
Yeah, where you live.

1107
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,838
Who's this?
- Who's this?

1108
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,230
I'm Molly Charlsworth.
It's such a pleasure.

1109
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,434
Yeah, Molly wants, see...

1110
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,114
Molly here and I we got some...

1111
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,835
we got something we wanna tell you.

1112
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,433
Something we want...
Go ahead, tell her.

1113
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,636
Well, I have something
I wanna say too, Vince.

1114
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,076
Yeah, but, we gotta tell you here
something that's very important.

1115
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,670
Really? Coz what I gotta say
is pretty important too.

1116
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,196
Yeah. But is it more important or
less important than what I gotta tell you?

1117
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:59,677
Well, I don't know Vince,
I don't know what it is you gotta tell me.

1118
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,189
May I just...
- Not a word, bitch.

1119
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,832
Hey, Joyce, you don't have to talk...

1120
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,951
Freak!
- Freak?

1121
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:12,352
You bring her into my home.
Into my own house...

1122
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,036
where I raised your 2 children.

1123
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,116
You bring this...

1124
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,998
this thing of yours.

1125
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,117
Let me tell you something, Vince.

1126
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,950
I'm gonna do you a big favor.
- What?

1127
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,548
I'm gonna put both of you
out of your misery.

1128
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,990
I would not be insulted
in my own home.

1129
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,873
I want you gone, Vince.
Out of my life.

1130
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,110
No more wandering around behind my back.

1131
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,555
No more dirty cheap little lies.

1132
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,954
No more lying in bed...

1133
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,833
wondering who else has been touching my husband.

1134
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,794
No more lying to myself
that it doesn't matter.

1135
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,796
I found passion today, Vince.

1136
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,399
It felt great.

1137
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,677
I was touched and kissed...

1138
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,273
...and held.

1139
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,475
And I felt like you haven't
made me feel in years.

1140
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,275
What are you talking about here?

1141
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,556
I'm talking about Tony.

1142
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,075
Tony? You did something with Tony?

1143
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,880
I did more than something with Tony.

1144
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,073
Dear...

1145
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,674
...great in script.

1146
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,349
Vince, get the key,
the key, I need it now.

1147
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,593
Me and you, we're gonna go
for a walk right now.

1148
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,910
It's not what you think. Just relax.

1149
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,513
Settle down.

1150
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,352
A little walk and a long talk.

1151
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,438
Put down the knife, alright?
- Stay right there.

1152
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,308
What're you wearing over there?
What's that you're wearing?

1153
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,396
Vince!

1154
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,910
Yeah, you better run,
you son of a bitch, I'm gonna kill you!

1155
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,110
Dad?

1156
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:28,159
Where are you going? You piece of shit!
You're a piece of shit...

1157
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,034
...who screwed my wife and screwed my daughter.

1158
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,872
And who's next? Who's next, my son?

1159
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,553
Hey, didn't screw nobody, alright.

1160
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,835
He didn't screw nobody.

1161
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,230
Vince, you're making a big mistake.
Put down the knife, alright.

1162
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,237
He's defending you.

1163
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,429
Put down the...

1164
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,114
He's defending you.
- Just put down the knife!

1165
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,196
Oh, dad, totally lame.

1166
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,039
There's no more knife, alright.
- Okay, no more knife.

1167
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,639
Peace, okay.

1168
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,638
I don't know what you think
happened here but peace okay...

1169
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,035
and we can talk.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1170
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,672
Leave him alone, Vince.

1171
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,437
Rough.

1172
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,556
Vince, stop it!

1173
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,879
Stop it, Vince!
He didn't do nothing.

1174
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,831
Hey, get off. Get out of here.
Do nothing? What about all that passion?
And all that crap you're talking about..

1175
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,474
Yeah, what about yours?

1176
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,278
Your Molly Ringworth over there.

1177
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,715
Who I'm supposed to thank
for being in your life.

1178
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,757
You bring your filthy girlfriend
into my house.

1179
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,154
She's not my girlfriend!

1180
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,157
I'm his manager.

1181
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,676
Your what?

1182
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,990
My manager for the Scorsese
and DeNiro movie.

1183
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,229
What DeNiro movie?

1184
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:40,069
I'm gonna be in a Robert DeNiro
movie with Martin Scorsese.

1185
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,838
Your dad's an actor?

1186
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,230
No, liar, he's a liar.

1187
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,510
Oh, what kind of bullshit is that?

1188
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,432
Actually, he hasn't been signed yet...

1189
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,994
but he auditioned today and
apparently make quite an impression.

1190
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,269
They called him back.

1191
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,879
You went on a movie audition today.

1192
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,678
That's right. That's what I've
been trying to tell you.

1193
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,876
And Molly here she is a friend of mine...

1194
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,476
a "friend". "Friend".
And we go to an acting class together.

1195
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,160
And she's the one who told
me to go on the audition today.

1196
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,111
And that's why I'm  here.
And that's what's happening.

1197
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,919
What acting class?
When do you take an acting class?

1198
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,349
When I play poker!

1199
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,349
It's the truth, you see...

1200
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,914
Vincent didn't tell because...

1201
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:20,197
he has feelings of shame
and inferiority about his ambition.

1202
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,958
Hey, don't go that far.

1203
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,394
Oh, I don't believe you.

1204
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,590
What? You know what,
I don't give a shit if you don't believe me.

1205
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,478
In fact, I don't give a shit
if you don't believe me...

1206
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,710
because you got a few things
to answer for yourself.

1207
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,435
Like what's going on over here?
What? What?

1208
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,959
Are you leaving me for her?

1209
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,917
Oh come on, mom.
Dad couldn't get her.

1210
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,753
Hey, little girl, I think you better shut
your mouth and mind your own business.

1211
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,510
Anyway, what are you doing handcuffed
to that animal over there in that robe?

1212
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,957
Tell him.

1213
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,032
Yeah, tell him.

1214
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,073
I was back at school...

1215
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,556
Oh my God! Just tell him
the truth. You're all so sick.

1216
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,356
I stole your car.
- You stole the car?

1217
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,553
I boosted your goddamn car so I could
take off and get away from all your crap.

1218
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,592
What is that gotta do with her?
The young one over there.

1219
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,875
Go ahead.

1220
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,479
Yeah, go ahead.

1221
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,397
I'm a stripper.

1222
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:17,630
A what?

1223
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,670
What about those two things?

1224
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,274
I paid for them myself, alright.

1225
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,638
You go to college, you're in a school,
you got that scholarship.

1226
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,028
They took it away, okay.

1227
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,630
I can go back next semester but
I gotta pay for it myself.

1228
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,988
And I'm gonna.

1229
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,230
Why did they take your scholarship away?

1230
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,158
Because I screwed up, okay,
Mom, I screwed up. Me.

1231
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,032
And I got caught...

1232
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,555
I got caught with pot in my room.

1233
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,749
You smoked pot?

1234
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,990
Yes, I smoked pot.

1235
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,908
God, it's such a stupid word, pot.

1236
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,751
They took away your scholarship...

1237
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:00,510
and kicked you out of school
because of a little pot?

1238
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,114
Oh sweetie, honey everyone smokes pot.

1239
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:07,677
Okay, wait a second with the lovey dovey
thing here, we got a lot of things to settle.

1240
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:12,469
You've stolen my car, you know I can
have you locked up in 10 minutes for that.

1241
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,592
Fine, do it. At least
everyones honest.

1242
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,910
You're so scared of your wife you
won't even smoke in front of her.

1243
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,359
Vince? You're smoking.

1244
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,310
No, no, I quit.

1245
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,829
Liar. And you got your wife
thinking you got a girlfriend...

1246
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,714
coz you're too scared to tell her
you wanna take an acting class.

1247
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,513
This whole time, you got
this weird agenda with me

1248
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,272
and you won't even tell me what it is.

1249
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,715
Why did you get me out of jail, Vince?

1250
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,792
Why did you bring me here?
- I told you I was a friend of your mother.

1251
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,157
My mother never had a friend so
good they'd do me a right turn.

1252
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,589
Everyone hated her.
She was a drunk and a whore.

1253
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,995
And she got you to get me out of jail.
I don't know what the hell I'm gonna think...

1254
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,754
Whatever I did, I did on my own.
Nobody puts me up to anything.

1255
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,708
Your mother was a
goddamn psycho bitch.

1256
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,111
And that's why I walked out of
her before you were born.

1257
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,239
You're my father.

1258
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,794
I'm your father.

1259
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,359
Oh my God.

1260
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,269
Wait a second.

1261
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,434
Alright, what happened here?

1262
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,633
Oh, no, no, sweetie.
Your son was a perfect gentleman.

1263
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,111
How long have you known about this guy?

1264
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,874
I've been trying to tell you
for years now. I just...

1265
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,756
There's so much I wanna tell you.

1266
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:08,310
I just could never...I could never
find which seems to be the right time.

1267
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,668
I thought you were just sick of me.
- Sick of you?

1268
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,952
No, scared of you maybe a little bit
but never sick of you.

1269
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,073
You're like a...

1270
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,357
you're the air that I breath.

1271
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,394
Will somebody please uncuff me?

1272
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,752
I can't believe...

1273
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,674
I got your back.
You're my boy now.

1274
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,393
Hey, come here, hug your brother.

1275
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,554
Right now, let's go, hug your brother.

1276
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,915
Well, mom, you were right.

1277
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,674
Dad did have sex with Tony's mom.

1278
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,308
Kudos to you!
Well, well done.

1279
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,709
Molly?

1280
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,433
Molly Charlsworth?

1281
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,953
She left town, I think.

1282
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,031
Isn't she your partner?
- Yeah.

1283
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,873
Is she gonna be back?
- I don't think so.

1284
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,877
One less actor in New York
for you guys to compete with.

1285
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,119
You ready, Vince?

1286
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,318
Yeah.
- Go ahead.

1287
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,552
You know the day, you asked
me about my worst secret

1288
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,675
my most personal secret
the secret of all my secrets.

1289
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,756
At that time, I don't understand it.

1290
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,832
But now I get it.

1291
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,434
First, I wanna begin you why,
where I'm from...

1292
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:33,317
My name is Vincent Rizzo
and I'm from City Island...

1293
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,158
<i>Somehow with Tony's appearance...</i>

1294
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,595
<i>a lot of good things happened.</i>

1295
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,556
You are one lying son of a bitch!

1296
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,310
To my husband, the best actor in City Island.

1297
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,116
<i>I guessed I should've looked for a musical.</i>

1298
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,834
How's that man? It's good?
- Fantastic.

1299
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,157
To my father, the only actor on City Island.
- Hey, watch yourself.

1300
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,874
And here, we're going again.
But it's not you, you were excellent, Vince.

1301
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,918
We're making some adjustments.
- Okay, whatever. I'm here.

1302
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,035
<i>Every busy city needs an island of peace.</i>

1303
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,391
<i>Just like every busy soul needs a place to propose.</i>

1304
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,114
Hey, Vinnie, get over here.

1305
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,198
<i>Me, I was lucky..</i>

1306
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,031
<i>because God he has a way of busting you...</i>

1307
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,276
<i>when you most need it.</i>

1308
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,273
<i>And he has a way of giving you a second chance.
To attend for your screw ups.</i>

1309
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,710
<i>Now, I got my second chance.</i>

1310
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,713
Okay, let's eat!
