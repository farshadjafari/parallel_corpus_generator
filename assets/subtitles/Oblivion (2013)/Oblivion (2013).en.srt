402
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,609
They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

403
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,402
Then they invaded.

404
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,090
We won the war,

405
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,689
but Earth was ruined.

424
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,365

that brought her down.
