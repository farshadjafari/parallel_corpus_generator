00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,415
My beloved..

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,707
I'm far away from you
but you're right in front of me.

4
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,082
I feel as if I'm watching you-

5
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,749
You must be reading this letter
lying down in solitude.

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,124
Everything around you
must've blended with you-

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,415
The clouds must've spread all over
just like the kohl in your eyes.

8
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,082
You must be gazing all around you-

9
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,999
-having shifted your
eyes from the letter.

10
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,999
The entire earth must
be resembling your face.

11
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,957
Who is it?

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,499
Sunil was supposed to
have come to pick you up.

13
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,165
Why didn't he come as yet?
- I don't know.

14
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,999
Wow! Sunil has a wonderful
style to announce his arrival!

15
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,957
"Your eyes.. they're sheer magic"

16
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,540
"Your body's sheer perfume"

17
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:52,957
"Your eyes.. they're sheer magic"

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,290
"Say yes.."

19
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,874
"or no-"

20
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:03,832
"whether you say yes or no
you're mine Kiran"

21
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,540
"you're mine Kiran"

22
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:35,457
"The distances between
us are vanishing.."

23
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:40,832
"we're getting closer to each other"

24
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:46,040
"The distances between
us are vanishing.."

25
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:51,457
"we're getting closer to each other"

26
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,874
"From the skies I will seek you"

27
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:02,290
"From this world
I shall snatch you away"

28
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,915
"Say yes.."

29
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,707
"or say no.."

30
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:13,332
"whether you say yes or no
you're mine Kiran-"

31
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,207
"you're mine Kiran"

32
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,332
"Your eyes are sheer magic"

33
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:26,499
"Yours is an enchanting scent"

34
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,082
"Say yes.."

35
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,707
"or say no.."

36
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:37,540
"whether you agree or disagree
you're mine Kiran"

37
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:55,374
"you're mine Kiran"

38
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,999
What are you thinking?
- I know Sunil is somewhere around-

39
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,415
But he isn't revealing himself.
- Why could he be hiding himself?

40
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:18,124
He enjoys harassing me a lot.
- I know where Sunil is.

41
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,374
You know? Then tell me!

42
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,915
Come on!

43
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,540
Over here! His image is
hidden here in the heart!

44
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:45,165
When love crosses limits
it becomes devotion.

45
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,124
And when devotion goes astray
it becomes an obsession.

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,790
This story too is about
the obsession of love.

47
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,374
It has the truth which was present
in the love of Laila and Majnu.

48
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,415
It also has the intensity-

49
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,915
-that was present in the hearts
of Romeo and Juliet-

50
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:06,082
It also has the emotions like
in the songs of Heer and Ranjha.

51
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,999
But it also has one more element..

52
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,457
-something which has not
featured in any love story so far-

53
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,207
'Fear'.

54
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:49,207
"You are the picture of my dreams"

55
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:54,582
"You are my destiny itself
O ignorant one"

56
00:06:55,458 --> 00:07:00,249
"You are the picture of my dreams"

57
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:05,290
"You are my destiny itself
O ignorant one"

58
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,540
"Don't ever belong
to someone else.."

59
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:16,290
"or I could go to any lengths
that's how crazy I am"

60
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,957
"Agree-"

61
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,499
"or disagree-"

62
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:27,415
"whether you agree or disagree
you're mine Kiran"

63
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,374
"you're mine Kiran"

64
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,957
"Your eyes cast a spell"

65
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:40,790
"Yours is an enchanting scent"

66
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,124
"Acquiesce-"

67
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,957
"or decline-"

68
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:51,790
"whether you acquiesce or decline
you're mine Kiran"

69
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,999
"you're mine Kiran"

70
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:45,290
Terrorists have kidnapped
the little daughter of our Minister-

71
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,624
And they've put forth
the condition that..

72
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,165
-if their leader is not released
they'll shoot the child dead.

73
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,249
We've to save the girl- And only
you can carry out this task.

74
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,915
Where is the child Sir?

75
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,624
Their boat is anchored in
the middle of the ocean.

76
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,207
The child is there.

77
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:23,124
Sunil we are all proud of the
task executed by you and your unit.

78
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,999
As long as we have
brave men like you..

79
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,499
-the enemies of peace can
never succeed in our country.

80
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,040
I thank you all on
behalf of the government-

81
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,749
-the minister and myself.

82
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,374
In view of the
success of the mission-

83
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,040
-all of you is being granted
a holiday for a period of one month-

84
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,540
We will meet again after a month-

85
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,999
Jai Hind.

86
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,415
This is the final day of this match.

87
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:14,415
India needs just 2 wickets to win-
The pressure is mounting on England.

88
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,540
Azhar's team is under pressure.
And he has tightened the fielding.

89
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,790
Let's go. We're getting late.
- India's bowlers-

90
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,165
-are bowling cautiously because
this win is very crucial to them.

91
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,624
We should win. Come on!

92
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,540
We're getting late. Kiran's
train must've already arrived.

93
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,540
To hell with the train. I will return
only after ensuring India's win.

94
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,957
There comes Kumble! Come on!

95
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,165
You are the least worried.
Shall I go on my own?

96
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,999
Vijay just look at the time.

97
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,249
All right. I am leaving.

98
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,415
We have seen enough-

99
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,374
There is a delay but no denial.

100
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,457
My countrymen have been wonderful!

101
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,665
Win!

102
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,082
Let's go now at least!

103
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,582
Kapil Dev was so insistent that I
should’ve had a cup of tea with him.

104
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,249
But you're always in a hurry.

105
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,582
Come on-get down now.

106
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,165
Mr. Sunil had telephoned for you.

107
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,957
Don't take his name in my presence-

108
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,415
Why is she so enraged?
- She isn't-

109
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,999
The fire of love is flaring since
Sunil didn't come to receive her.

110
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,790
Not everyone is a hen-pecked
husband like I am-

111
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,082
Yes yes- I know.

112
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,290
He didn't even come to the station.

113
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,999
I won't spare him when he meets me.

114
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,582
You shameless fellow!
You are always scaring me!

115
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,332
I felt as if some
dead body fell on me-

116
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,915
You're mad!

117
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,040
Don't you know that
in a girl's cupboard-

118
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:14,082
-one gets nothing except old
letters old lovers or new sarees.

119
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:20,082
What if my heart had failed?

120
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,582
How could it have failed?
It's in my possession.

121
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,124
I won't speak to you-
You're a bad man.

122
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,999
Just look how my heart is beating.

123
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,082
Yes it indeed is beating.
- Don't fool around now- Tell me..

124
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,457
-why didn't you meet
me when you came to SimIa?

125
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,749
Why did you have to harass me
so much?

126
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,999
It would've been so much fun
if we had returned together!

127
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,082
Which fool said that
I'd come to SimIa?

128
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,082
You didn't?
- No!

129
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,832
Really?
- Darling-

130
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,082
Someone who dreams of
always being by your side..

131
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,207
-how can he not appear
before you if he is close to you?

132
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,624
Then who was that person?

133
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,082
She isn't mine.

134
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,082
She is mine!

135
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,540
She isn't mine.

136
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,707
She is mine!

137
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,999
She isn't mine.

138
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,582
She is mine!

139
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,082
She isn't mine.

140
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,290
She is mine!

141
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,999
She isn't mine.

142
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,499
She is mine!

143
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,915
She isn't mine.

144
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,999
She is mine!

145
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,999
Kiran! You are mine!

146
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,707
It's a nice place.

147
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,499
Whose house are we going to?

148
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,374
A house belongs to
those who live in it.

149
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,874
That's what I want to know.
Who is living here?

150
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:23,999
Right now it's some hopes and
some dreams that live there-

151
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,499
Come on! Tell me!
- I will tell you- Come on!

152
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,332
Why're you harassing me? Why don't
you tell me who is living here?

153
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,499
As you wish!

154
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,374
What is this?

155
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,332
This is our home.

156
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,332
After our marriage this
small world will be ours.

157
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,290
"It's a small house but..

158
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,790
"it's a small house but.."

159
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,457
"I hope you will like it"

160
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,999
"Shut the doors first"

161
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:34,749
"Whether I say yes or not.."

162
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:39,540
"you must bring me around"

163
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,249
"Shut the door first"

164
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:09,540
"This isn't just a house.
It's a dream"

165
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:14,582
"No dream our love is for true"

166
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,207
"This isn't just a house.
It's a dream"

167
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:27,832
"No dream our love is for true"

168
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,999
"So let's give each
other a loving hug.."

169
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,040
"so let's give each
other a loving hug.."

170
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:41,040
"and make the best of our meeting"

171
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,082
"After you have shut the door"

172
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:54,540
"Whether I say yes or not.."

173
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:59,249
"you must bring me around"

174
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:07,874
"Shut the door first"

175
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:34,415
"Do not touch me lover boy-"

176
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,957
"it'll soil my fair body"

177
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:48,082
"Do not touch me lover boy-"

178
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,749
"it'll soil my fair body"

179
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:57,082
"Of this coIour and beauty.."

180
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,249
"Don't let your
complexion and your beauty.."

181
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:06,332
"make you so vain"

182
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,790
"Let's shut the door first"

183
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:19,790
"Whether I say yes or not.."

184
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:25,082
"you must bring me around"

185
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,749
"Shut the door first"

186
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,040
"So let’s shut the door"

187
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,165
"Must I bring the Sun and the stars?
Or must I bring flowers?"

188
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,790
"How am I to decorate this house?"

189
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,707
"With flowers
I'll do up the house.."

190
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,207
"tell me what things
have I to bring then?"

191
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:25,665
"It's your heart
I'm going to live in"

192
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:30,665
"Just you make arrangements
for that"

193
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:34,582
"Let's shut the door first"

194
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,874
"It's a small house"

195
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,040
"it's a small house.."

196
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:49,124
"I hope you will like it"

197
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,999
"Shut the doors first"

198
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,374
"Whether I say yes or not.."

199
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:07,249
"you must bring me around"

200
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:25,457
"After you have shut the door"

201
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,582
What's the hurry?

202
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:54,915
The mischief in your eyes
and the smile on your lips..

203
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,499
-indicates that you don't
have honourable intentions.

204
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,457
Intentions are good
but I've evil plans.

205
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,415
Hey! Brother!

206
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,665
Where's the key?

207
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,207
Who is it?

208
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,582
What's this nonsense?

209
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,457
Who is it?

210
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,415
Open the door!

211
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,749
Open the door Brother!

212
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,999
Brother! Brother!

213
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,665
Sister-in-law!

214
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,624
Hurry up!

215
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,540
Hey! Where is he?

216
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,082
Who is it? It's you Kiran?

217
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,915
That man..
- What happened? Which man?

218
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:21,915
The one who had sung a song
was here just now.

219
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,790
He was pointing the torch at me-

220
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,790
Do you want to play night cricket?
What a strange player you are!

221
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,249
You want to play and yet
aren't coming out into the open-

222
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,249
Are you bowling in the dark?
Come out into the open.

223
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,082
He ran away.
- Oh God I got scared.

224
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,790
He ran away when he saw my team!

225
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,707
If you return again
I will run you out.

226
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,499
There's nobody. You've
just been imagining things.

227
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,874
I'm feeling scared.
- Why are you scared?

228
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,040
We are there with you.

229
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,082
And who could it be
who is harassing Kiran?

230
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,082
It must be a 12th player. He must
be wanting to play in Sunil's place.

231
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,457
But as long as I am the captain
nobody can play.

232
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,915
Come on-let's go to sleep.
- Yes let's go.

233
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,457
Everything will be fine-

234
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,332
Hey! Open the door! Don't
throw me out of the team!

235
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,624
Open the door!

236
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:13,665
Who are you?

237
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,790
Girl's pictures? But I've
been married haven't I?

238
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,665
You're at it in the mornings too?

239
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,832
Put on your spectacles-
They are Kiran's pictures.

240
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,582
Where did they come from?
- In the morning post-

241
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,832
Some of your photographs
have arrived.

242
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,374
My photographs?

243
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,207
Who has clicked them?
- What do you mean?

244
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,290
Let us know if there is
anybody else besides Sunil.

245
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,457
I don't want to be
caught out on the wrong ball.

246
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,290
These photographs are from Shimla-
But I never got them clicked-

247
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,040
Then somebody else must've clicked
them to show it to his mother.

248
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,499
She's beautiful Mother-
She's really beautiful-

249
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,415
She's so beautiful that
one is scared to even..

250
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,124
-look at her
to the heart's content.

251
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,749
Really Mother. You too would
be surprised to see her beauty.

252
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,207
There's a strange magic in her eyes-

253
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,707
When she looks it feels like..

254
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,832
-as if time will
come to a standstill..

255
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,082
-the earth will stop rotating..

256
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,999
-and her smile..

257
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,624
Mother you should see
her smiling at least once.

258
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:40,457
You will feel as if all the miseries
in the world have suddenly ended.

259
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:45,249
As if the whole of earth
is filled with flowers.

260
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,957
Mother! Mother! She's not a mere
girl but a blessing from you..

261
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,665
-a blessing which
has landed on the earth.

262
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,874
Mother you should only pray that
I can make her your daughter-in-law.

263
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,582
You will pray for your son
won't you? For his son's happiness?

264
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,332
With whom are you talking?

265
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:13,790
I'm talking to Mother.

266
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:22,999
What's the problem
if he speaks to his mother sometimes?

267
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:28,165
The problem is that it has been
18 years since his mother died.

268
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,915
How did she die?
- In a car accident.

269
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,582
Who was driving the car?
- I was.

270
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:44,374
And you were saved?
- Yes- With the Lord's grace.

271
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,165
How are your relations with Rahul?
- What do you mean?

272
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:52,207
Does he consider you a criminal?
- What do you mean?

273
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:56,457
Does he feel that you
are his mother's killer?

274
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,999
None of his statements
seem to indicate that!

275
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,707
Does he speak to you?
- On very few occasions.

276
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:06,999
Actually he has been a lonely
and shy kid since childhood.

277
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,790
He has very few friends. He is most
of the time lost in his own world-

278
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,707
It means that he has
many other problems too.

279
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:23,790
"Your eyes are sheer magic"

280
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,165
"Yours is an enchanting scent"

281
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:34,707
"Your eyes are sheer magic"

282
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:40,249
"Yours is an enchanting scent"

283
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,957
"Say yes.."

284
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,832
"or no-"

285
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:51,707
"whether you agree or disagree
you're mine Kiran"

286
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,749
"you're mine Kiran"

287
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:44,415
"You're mine Kiran"

288
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:52,999
"You're the picture of my dreams"

289
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:59,332
"You're my destiny itself"

290
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:05,499
"You're the picture of my dreams"

291
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:11,249
"You're my destiny itself"

292
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:13,999
So you've finally come!

293
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,749
I was held up in the traffic.
- I see-

294
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,040
Shall we go?
- Where to?

295
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,915
Let's go.
- Not there. Here-

296
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,999
Stop meeting Sunil-
- Who are you?

297
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:58,040
Only a lover can have such
a forceful voice and a heavy breath.

298
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,249
Why do you telephone me?
- Don't disconnect the line.

299
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,082
Listen to me. It's very urgent.

300
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,874
Sunil doesn't deserve you.

301
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:09,749
He wants to win you over
by gifting you a flat-

302
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:13,832
The fool doesn't even understand
that you won't be happy in..

303
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,040
-a concrete flat.

304
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,415
You've to stay in a house where-

305
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:22,207
-the dream-like doors are
decorated with cloud-like curtains.

306
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:26,457
-where there's coolness of
wet grass under one's feet-

307
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:31,249
-where there would be no walls
but layers of brightness and darkness.

308
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,790
-where creeper-plants
have stars growing on them-

309
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:37,499
-where the waves sound like
the small bells on the ankle-

310
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,040
Why have you been
chasing me? What do you desire?

311
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:43,457
I love you. I love you a lot.

312
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,790
Whoever you are you had
better understand this clearly-

313
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,540
Nothing will happen by your
telephoning me or threatening me.

314
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:55,040
I will do whatever I want to do.
I will live just like I want to.

315
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,415
You may try whatever you like.
- I too want that-

316
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,249
-you should live
just like you should.

317
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:07,040
Close to me with me in my arms..

318
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,999
How strange! You didn't lift the
telephone though you were at home?

319
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,165
I had been telephoning
you for a long time.

320
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,249
Brother and
sister-in-law have gone out-

321
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,082
And I was feeling
scared of lifting the phone.

322
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:48,999
Why?
- Why does he telephone me?

323
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:54,665
What's there to be scared about?
All that the rascal does is telephone-

324
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,832
And it's up to oneself to disconnect
the phone whenever one wants.

325
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:06,332
It's good that you came.
I was feeling so scared.

326
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,749
There is nobody at home.

327
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,624
There's nobody at home?
- No.

328
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,207
Nobody?
- Yes nobody.

329
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:16,665
In that case shut the door.

330
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,082
I suggest that both of you
get married immediately.

331
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,457
After the marriage such
phone calls will discontinue-

332
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:27,332
I've been very glad at your
special comment Lala Amarnath.

333
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,207
Before my marriage I too used
to receive a lot of phone calls-

334
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,457
You know that Kiran. Don't you?
- But we never had a telephone!

335
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,665
But there was a telephone in
our neighbour's place. You idiot!

336
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:38,749
I used to get a lot of phone calls.

337
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,165
In fact an entire team of
girls had been chasing me.

338
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,874
My condition was like
that of a lone player..

339
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:45,457
-who was being
hounded by 11 players.

340
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:48,832
I decided against scoring singles.
And so I hit a sixer!

341
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,790
And thus I got married to Poonam.
- Yes of course!

342
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,082
Then what!
- An entire team had been chasing you?

343
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,707
You were in greater
demand than even Imran Khan?

344
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,790
What's Imran Khan in comparison?
- By the way..

345
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,207
-have you ever seen your face
in the mirror with the lights on?

346
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,415
Of course I've seen.

347
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:04,249
It's difficult to make out which
is the face and which is the head-

348
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:07,165
What nonsense is this?
- An entire team was chasing him?

349
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,790
You're making a fool of your husband?

350
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,540
How can you join hands with her?
Your brother is being insulted!

351
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,749
Come to Chandigarh with me
if you don't believe me-

352
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,582
Ask the girls there. Then you will
know what my situation was!

353
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,915
I will surely ask them
what they saw in you-

354
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,790
-that I couldn't
see in 10 long years!

355
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,249
You never looked at me
lovingly in the 10 years-

356
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,207
You're getting emotional.
What's your problem?

357
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:32,832
The issue was about us. And you
started your Mahabharat in between!

358
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,415
This Mahabharat is a
part of every Indian home-

359
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,249
Once you get married you too
will have a similar experience.

360
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,207
But how will we get married?
- Why?

361
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,082
Only when you remain quiet
can we arrive at a decision!

362
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,040
You have You keep quiet.
- What is he saying! - Keep quiet.

363
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,207
We've accepted your appeal.

364
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,207
You may go extend your leave-

365
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,999
-and start the
second innings of your life.

366
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,290
How are you Sunil?

367
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:03,790
Do I know you?
- No. But I know everything about you.

368
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,207
I don't even know your name.

369
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:09,665
My name is Rahul. And we're
heading for the same destination.

370
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,124
What is the destination?

371
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,540
Yes. Captain Mehra is my Daddy-

372
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,957
I'm glad to meet you.

373
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,499
Daddy often talks about you.
- About me?

374
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:25,790
Yes. He says that
if I were in the Navy..

375
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,665
-I would've become
as famous as you are.

376
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:31,999
But what do you do?

377
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,874
I love.
- Love?

378
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,957
Is it a profession or a hobby?
- Neither profession nor a hobby.

379
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,999
Love is life.
- You're right.

380
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,374
If there is no love
a human being does breathe..

381
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,457
-but he isn't living-

382
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:51,999
Have you ever fallen in love?

383
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,040
I'm in love
and I'm going to marry her too.

384
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,790
No Mother- I've no
objection to Sunil's marriage-

385
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:07,457
Neither do I've any enmity with him.
In fact he is a very nice person.

386
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:11,999
But how can he marry Kiran?

387
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,707
Because Kiran is mine. Only mine.

388
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,999
How can he steal Kiran from me?

389
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:23,915
He's mad!

390
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,749
Sunil is completely mad.

391
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:31,415
He doesn't even realise that it's
a big sin to separate true lovers.

392
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,165
Isn't it Mother?

393
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:37,040
Even Kiran has been
taken in by his sweet talk.

394
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,249
She has forgotten where she belongs.

395
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,957
Kiran is very innocent.

396
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,290
She doesn't listen to me.
She doesn't understand.

397
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,374
That's because
I explain to her lovingly.

398
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,790
But now-I will have to
explain to her in some other way-

399
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:18,374
Sunil it was you-

400
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,999
I was only joking.

401
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,332
Your joke will kill me some day.

402
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,999
You will realise it when I die.

403
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:34,540
It's not possible. How can a naval
officer's girlfriend drown to death?

404
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:46,040
Never repeat such a joke again-
Otherwise I will truly die-

405
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,457
Do you know..when you were
pulling me into the water-

406
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,999
-I was feeling as
if he was throttling me to death.

407
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:59,457
I feel very scared..

408
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,957
-not of my death
but of separating from you.

409
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,957
I cannot live away from you.

410
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,332
Darling who can separate us?

411
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,332
There isn't enough space
between the two of us-

412
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,832
-that some third
person could creep in.

413
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,832
Greetings to all of
you from Vijay Awasthi-

414
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,790
All the preparations have been
completed- The team is all ready.

415
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,665
But besides the players
there's nobody in the stadium.

416
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,749
The batting will be opened by Kiran
who has a knife in her hand..

417
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:52,457
-and she is heading for the cake-
But let me inform all of you..

418
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:55,957
-that the commentator has himself
paid the 1600 rupees for the cake.

419
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,082
I feel that you must've been born
on the cricket ground. Weren't you?

420
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,957
A lot of thanks for the
special comments Lala Amarnath!

421
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,790
The candles have been lit.
Kiran has made her preparations.

422
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:09,124
She has filled her mouth with air.
She's heading towards the candles.

423
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,915
Umpire Sunil's
signal is being awaited.

424
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,957
Umpire Sunil has signaled. And
the candles are being extinguished!

425
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,499
And most of the candles have
already been extinguished!

426
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,457
She hasn't fed the cake to her brother
but perhaps she will do so soon.

427
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:34,415
And Sunil inserted the cake in her
mouth and the lights have gone off.

428
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:37,999
And I now request the commentator
to take me towards the fuse.

429
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,707
Sure. Kiran take care
we will be back-

430
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:41,874
And here I have fallen hard-

431
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:42,999
And we both are going towards
the fuse.

432
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,915
No problem I will do first aid.

433
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,124
What're you doing?

434
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:25,999
He is somewhere here.

435
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:29,749
He was here just a while ago-

436
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,999
"You are the picture of my dreams"

437
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,790
He's singing.

438
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:41,665
"You are my destiny itself
O ignorant one"

439
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:46,957
"You are the picture of my dreams"

440
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:51,999
"You are my destiny itself
O ignorant one"

441
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:57,332
"Don't ever belong
to someone else.."

442
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:02,832
"or I could go to any lengths
that's how crazy I am"

443
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,374
The bastard has reached here too!

444
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:11,790
But how did he enter inside?

445
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,790
I think the matter
has gone out of hand.

446
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,540
We should inform the police.

447
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,624
Go carefully.

448
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,082
My gift?

449
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,207
Hey! I forgot!

450
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,540
It doesn't matter.
Give it to me now.

451
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,665
Shut your eyes-

452
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,457
Today I've placed my
heart on your heart-

453
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:07,957
I didn't know that
you've a heart of diamond.

454
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,374
Whether made of stone or a diamond
a heart is a heart.

455
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,874
It starts beating as soon as it
receives a little warmth of love.

456
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,415
And what if I attach your
real heart with my heart?

457
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:20,540
Then you will hear nothing..

458
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:24,124
-except for your name.

459
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,165
Let me speak to Kiran.
- Who are you speaking?

460
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:37,665
Tell her she will receive her
birthday present in a short while.

461
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,540
But who are you speaking?

462
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,874
I've written my name on her cheeks.

463
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,415
Scoundrel!
- Whose phone was it?

464
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,832
That same person.
- What was he saying?

465
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,124
He was saying that she will
get her birthday present shortly.

466
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,540
If I find him anywhere
I'll kill him.

467
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:20,499
If it is his phone speak
what I've instructed you.

468
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:22,957
Come on-lift the phone.

469
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,707
Lift the phone-

470
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,874
I'm feeling very scared.

471
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:33,040
If you continue to be so scared-

472
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,874
-you will have to live
with this fear all your life.

473
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,749
Come on lift the phone.

474
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,249
You took a long time
to lift the phone.

475
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:50,957
Didn't I tell you to
stop meeting Sunil?

476
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:53,665
But you didn't listen to me-

477
00:51:55,125 --> 00:52:00,290
Now look..if anything happens
to him I won't be responsible-

478
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,707
You will be responsible.
- I will be responsible?

479
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:11,415
I won't meet Sunil.
I will do as you say.

480
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:13,249
And what if you meet him?

481
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:18,707
I will not meet him- Never.

482
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,165
But I want to meet you.

483
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:29,582
You intend to trap me?
- No. I want to see you.

484
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:31,790
I know it is dangerous.

485
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,915
But I accept it for your sake.

486
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,582
Let's meet tomorrow at the
pool-side restaurant in Holiday Inn.

487
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:45,415
But how will I recognise you?
- How will you recognise me?

488
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:52,165
To recognise true love one
doesn't need eyes but the heart.

489
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:55,207
When I will appear before you..

490
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:57,874
-your heart beats will
recognise who has come.

491
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,999
Moreover I recognise you.

492
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,124
That scoundrel didn't
reveal his identity.

493
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,290
But I'm convinced that
he will surely come.

494
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:14,082
I feel we shouldn't deal with
this matter all by ourselves-

495
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,999
We should take the police with us.

496
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:19,332
Yes. If not the police
at least take a few men along.

497
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,665
One doesn't need
an army to kill a rat-

498
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,999
I'll be able to handle
that scared scoundrel!

499
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:55,999
Did you recognise me? I'm RahuI.
Look at me attentively.

500
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,040
In the college crowd the
boy who stood in the back-

501
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,874
-who never had the
courage to appear before you-

502
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:08,249
-who never dared to tell
you how much you mean to him.

503
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,582
The lips opened several
times to speak out to you..

504
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,999
-but the voice
was never supportive-

505
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:19,457
And today the atmosphere
smells of the days gone by.

506
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,665
There's a glimmer of
dreams in the eyes.

507
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,165
Today both of us are face to face.

508
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,415
And I want to tell you everything.

509
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:14,290
Try to make him speak
for a longer period..

510
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,457
-because it takes 3 to 4 minutes
to tap the phone number.

511
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,915
Carry on Kiran.

512
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,832
Finally you did
what I was scared of.

513
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,374
What did I do?
- You've cheated me!

514
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:37,374
Did you think that I didn't know
that Sunil is hiding up there?

515
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:40,582
So that when I come
I would be caught-

516
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:44,374
I didn't know that Sunil was there.

517
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:46,957
Perhaps you must not
even be knowing that..

518
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,249
-right now a policeman
is standing next to you.

519
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:54,374
On their instructions the telephone
exchange is tracing the number.

520
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:58,165
But don't worry-don't worry-

521
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,457
Because it is not
so easy to reach me.

522
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,707
But I can reach you whenever I like.

523
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,332
I will come to meet you tomorrow-

524
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:13,124
Tomorrow is Holi.
I'll play Holi with you.

525
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:19,165
I will see how the red
colour looks on your cheeks.

526
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,665
He was acting smart
with Inspector Ajgaonkar!

527
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,874
We will soon know
where he was speaking from-

528
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:40,415
What did you say?

529
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,415
This is our bedroom number-

530
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,249
Why didn't you tell me that
you've another number too?

531
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,999
But he always
telephoned on this number!

532
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:55,832
It's of no use- The
scoundrel must've slipped away.

533
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,040
What will happen now? I've invited
so many people to celebrate Holi.

534
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:03,540
How will we handle them?
- We will. We will.

535
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,832
He won't dare to come in the
presence of so many people.

536
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:08,082
Like always we will celebrate Holi
with great fanfare this year too.

537
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,707
You are never serious about anything.
- I am serious.

538
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,832
How will we keep an eye
with so many people around?

539
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:15,624
What if anything happens to Kiran?

540
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:16,957
Let the scoundrel come!

541
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:27,624
"That which you feel like.."

542
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:30,832
"that which you feel like.."

543
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,290
"you may do today"

544
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:40,874
"Take into your arms
the one you wish to hug"

545
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,290
"Make sure you hug me.."

546
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:59,457
"when you douse
the colours on me my love"

547
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:07,457
"Hug me my love
when you douse the colours on me"

548
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:11,957
"Cheek to cheek"

549
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:15,957
"Eyeball to eyeball"

550
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:18,790
"That's how the festival of
colours ought to be today-"

551
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:23,624
"so make sure you sprinkle
the colours on me my love"

552
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:40,249
"Hug me my love when you
douse the colours on me"

553
00:59:57,041 --> 01:00:00,915
"Apply the colour only on
the exterior do not go beyond that"

554
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,165
"Say nothing my love. Just stand
here with your eyes closed"

555
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:13,374
"Don't let this woman from
the neighbourhood get away"

556
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:17,874
"She mustn't return
if she goes away"

557
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:21,874
"He was so wicked when
he squeezed my arm!"

558
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:26,290
"My kohl the flowers in my hair..
he spared nothing"

559
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:30,249
"So report it-"

560
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:33,832
"So report it to the police-"

561
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:37,249
"I'll pay a penalty"

562
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:54,582
"Hug me my love
when you douse the colours on me"

563
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:20,790
"The colours rain
Upon the veiled maiden"

564
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,999
"Hold me in your arms-"

565
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:48,874
"Hold me in your arms when you
douse the colours on me my love"

566
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:22,832
"From your drenched figure.."

567
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,499
"flames appear to leap"

568
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,332
"Go your way traveller-"

569
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:35,499
"your eyes are straying"

570
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:40,290
"I've lost my way!
- You'd better find it"

571
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:44,499
"May I take your arm.
- Don't tease me lover boy"

572
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:48,832
"Don't break my heart!
- Let go of my scarf"

573
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:52,957
"What makes you angry?
- You broke my bangle"

574
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,165
"I'm heart-broken too"

575
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,082
"You're a liar!"

576
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:59,374
"If you dance I'll sing"

577
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,332
"Sit here I'm leaving"

578
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:05,415
"It's difficult to go away-
- You're a madcap"

579
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,415
"Hold me in your arms"

580
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,665
"If only you apply some colour"

581
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:13,832
"Blue or yellow?
- Neither blue not yellow"

582
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:18,540
"Red or pink-?
- You tell him sis-in-law"

583
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:22,749
"With a pinch of vermillion-"

584
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,999
"take her for your bride"

585
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:50,999
"Hold me in your arms when you
douse colours on me my love"

586
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,374
Didn't I tell you
that he wouldn't come?

587
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:13,332
And you even celebrated Holi merrily-
So shall we leave now?

588
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,415
All right then.
- Thanks a lot.

589
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:18,415
Where are you going?
- To take a bath-

590
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,374
It's very enjoyable to bathe
together after playing Holi.

591
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:22,040
Enough of it!
- In that case let's play cricket.

592
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,415
Stop talking nonsense.
- Only one over-

593
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,207
Why're you accompanying me?
- To take a bath-

594
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:27,457
Have you gone mad?

595
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,124
It's fun to bathe
together after playing Holi!

596
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:31,832
You shameless fellow!

597
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,707
They haven't been rewarded!
Do you have money?

598
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:43,665
I will take it back!

599
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:46,790
I'm waiting for you in the tub!

600
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:50,707
Wish you a happy Holi!

601
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:54,874
Happy Holi!

602
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:01,332
Happy Holi Kiran!

603
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:11,957
Which way did he go?

604
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,624
Take it easy Sunil.

605
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,624
Whom are you searching for?

606
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:11,790
You didn't do the right thing-

607
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,290
You shouldn’t have hit me.

608
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:24,499
But now you will have to
pay for every drop of blood-

609
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,999
For every drop of blood.

610
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:39,082
A parcel has arrived for you.
- How nice! So early in the morning!

611
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:43,582
Who has brought it?
- I'm not aware who brought it-

612
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:48,374
When I reached the door I found
this packet lying by the door.

613
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,665
I'm leaving.
I've a lot of work to do.

614
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,540
I have to serve breakfast for sir.

615
01:07:58,833 --> 01:07:59,957
Don't be afraid.

616
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:03,499
This is not Sunil's blood
but mine..

617
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,999
-which flowed when
Sunil's stone hit me.

618
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,165
Now my stones are waiting for Sunil.

619
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:13,499
Tell him that every drop of
blood will be accounted for-

620
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:27,749
Let me speak to Sunil. Where has
he gone? Which friend's house?

621
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:30,915
Remember to attend the wedding.

622
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:34,457
How can you say that? Of course
I will attend your wedding-

623
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:46,915
What happened?

624
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,040
What difference would it make
if we are married a few days later.

625
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:52,374
You've lost faith in me because-

626
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,915
-I haven't been able
to catch that scoundrel!

627
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:56,499
I could not get him punished-

628
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,665
So you're scared that
I won't be able to protect you-

629
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:03,249
Yes I am scared.
But not for myself.

630
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:05,999
I'm not bothered even
if he kills me.

631
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:08,707
But if something were to
happen to my beloved..

632
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:10,582
-what will happen of me?

633
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:17,790
Darling one who has you
your love your trust..

634
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,999
-nobody can harm such a person.

635
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:25,165
Tell me something Kiran.

636
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:28,249
Even though the girls spread their
nets in the whole of the ocean..

637
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:31,124
-to catch the fish and
yet the fish remained elusive-

638
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,124
How could you catch the fish?

639
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,457
Answer him-

640
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:39,624
That is how it is. Fishes who
break through biggest of nets-

641
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,790
-happen to get
trapped in a small hook.

642
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:47,915
You don't have a sister do you?
- No why?

643
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:51,332
If you had I would’ve
got RahuI married to her.

644
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:55,999
All right Sir. We are leaving.
A lot of cards have to be distributed-

645
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:59,665
But do attend the marriage.
And bring along Rahul too-

646
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:18,165
Was someone here?
- Yes Sunil had come.

647
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:21,749
Who was accompanying him?
- His fiancée Kiran.

648
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:27,999
Kiran had come here?
- You know her?

649
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:32,457
She's a very nice girl.

650
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,749
If you ask me you should find
a girl like Kiran for yourself.

651
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,790
The journey of life
will become easy.

652
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:45,665
There can be no girl like Kiran-

653
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:49,040
You're absolutely right. That's why
she has got such a good boy!

654
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:55,415
This is Sunil's marriage invitation.
And he insists that you must attend.

655
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:59,457
I'm pressurising you
for marriage because..

656
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,457
-how long would you live alone?

657
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:09,499
Every ship needs an anchor
at some point of time.

658
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:28,957
No..

659
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:34,374
This marriage cannot take place.

660
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,832
No!

661
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:58,374
You cannot belong to
anybody else. Never!

662
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:05,707
Because if it happens
nobody will love anybody else-

663
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,832
People will begin to hate love-

664
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:10,999
No Kiran!

665
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,957
Don't do this!

666
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:16,790
Don't do it please!

667
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:20,832
Don't punish me so severely!

668
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:31,624
I'm living today on the strength
of your love and your pictures.

669
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:37,374
If you take away even one thing
from me what will happen of me?

670
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:42,415
I've nothing except your love.

671
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:49,082
What will I do?

672
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:51,540
No!

673
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:56,040
This is not the time to weep.

674
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,457
Kiran's life is in danger-

675
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:05,332
You will have to rescue her.

676
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,957
You will have to do something.

677
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:13,540
Look at this sister-in-law!

678
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:16,540
Look at this one.
I find this attractive-

679
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,999
It looks beautiful-
- Yes-

680
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,040
Let's buy this.

681
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,957
How about a gold one too?
Let's see a longer one.

682
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:29,915
How about that?
- Show us that one.

683
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,040
Look at this one.
- Yes-

684
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,207
How about this one?

685
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:41,749
Couldn’t you have sat quietly?
- How do I know it'd get stuck?

686
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:45,499
You stick things wherever you can.
- You've started it again here too?

687
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:49,040
The ring has got stuck.
- Why did you wear it?

688
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,874
I didn't know that
it would get stuck-

689
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:53,665
What should we do now?
- Don't worry.

690
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:55,999
We will cut it and remove it-
- The finger?!

691
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:00,665
Madam how can we cut
the customer's fingers?

692
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,915
Pack these two sets.

693
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:05,790
And deliver this to our home-

694
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:13,624
Thanks.
- I will get the car.

695
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:16,040
Hold on. We're coming.
- Let me make the payment.

696
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:17,999
Meanwhile you may
try some other ring-

697
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,582
Here it is.
- Shall we leave?

698
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:37,582
But one thing is for sure. You looked
lovey wearing the ladies ring.

699
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:39,249
All right. I made a mistake.

700
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:05,082
Doctor how is Sunil?

701
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,957
Nothing can be said
for at least 24 hours-

702
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:10,415
Can I meet him?
- You can only see him.

703
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,082
Because he is still unconscious.

704
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:35,165
Your life has been
threatened because of me.

705
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,540
I cannot bear to see it.

706
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:44,540
I'm going far away from you-
For good-

707
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:50,957
Lord please protect
my Sunil’s life.

708
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,665
His life is my life.

709
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:58,874
Make him recover at the earliest.

710
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:02,707
It's not that I am happy at being
saved or grief at being injured.

711
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:07,082
But I'm furious that though the
scoundrel was so close to me..

712
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,915
-still he slipped out of my hands-

713
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:13,457
I feel your unseen
enemy is somewhat insane-

714
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,165
He doesn't even understand
the simple thing that..

715
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,374
-to win over a girl
it's important to win over her heart-

716
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:22,374
Murdering the fiancé
won't get him the girl-

717
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:24,540
Good Morning Sir.

718
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,249
How are you?
- I'm fine.

719
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:28,415
You are fine?

720
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,582
You've been amazing. You got saved
despite being hit by a bullet.

721
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:34,207
I'm glad about that.

722
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:37,457
Otherwise if someone is murdered on
a road, things get difficult for us.

723
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,040
Then we have to take testimony of
everybody in the market.

724
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:42,290
Ah that reminds
me.. I've to take your statement.

725
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:43,582
Go ahead!

726
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:46,582
Did you see anybody firing at you?
- No.

727
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:50,832
You chased him for such a long
stretch and still didn't see a thing?

728
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,540
Just his jacket and jeans-

729
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,290
Nothing else..

730
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,082
What about his height?

731
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:03,915
He must be of Rahul's height.
- 5 feet 10 inches-

732
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:05,582
What?

733
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,332
My height.

734
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:11,540
Anyhow we are leaving.

735
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,874
Let's go Rahul-

736
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:20,957
Beware of your unknown
enemy's next attack.

737
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,374
The next attack will be mine
not his.

738
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:30,374
All right Sir. I'm leaving.

739
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:02,832
Where are you going?

740
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:07,457
Tell me-

741
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:15,415
In this manner-quietly..
..without informing anybody..

742
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:17,707
-without meeting..
..why're you going away?

743
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:25,540
Tell me-what's the matter?

744
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:34,290
I'm not leaving.
Where am I leaving?

745
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:37,457
I can never leave this city.

746
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,957
The breeze which contains
the fragrance of your breath-

747
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:46,499
-the land which has been
walked all over by you-

748
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,999
-how can I leave that place?

749
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:53,624
Kiran is a threat
for your well-being.

750
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,374
You've been attacked
twice because of me.

751
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,457
A third one is also possible.

752
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:06,332
And I cannot tolerate any
harm being caused to you.

753
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,082
That's why Kiran will
have to go away from here.

754
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:12,457
Kiran cannot live here.

755
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:21,665
Lift your head..
..look into my eyes.

756
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:24,749
What do you see in these eyes?

757
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:32,374
Do these eyes belong to a weak man-

758
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:36,540
-who would close his eyes upon
coming face-to-face with death?

759
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:42,582
Look at these eyes..
are they not strong enough that..

760
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,874
-they can throttle
some coward to death?

761
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:50,374
Look at these wounds..
they are proof of the fact that-

762
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:52,999
-a body which contains
love in the form of blood..

763
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:55,290
-such a body cannot
be severed into pieces.

764
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,749
Before giving up hope in
the face of unseen fear..

765
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:02,999
-you had better check out
the strength of these arms-

766
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:06,749
You should have checked out whether
the shoulders which you lean upon..

767
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:10,874
-can they bear the burden
of your protection or not?

768
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:15,582
No Sunil. Don't stop me.
Please let me go.

769
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,249
I can die
but I cannot see you dying.

770
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:24,457
I beg of you. Please let me go.

771
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:29,707
All right. You may go.
I won't stop you.

772
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:33,165
But wherever you go you
will go after becoming mine.

773
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:35,915
You will go as Mrs. Sunil Malhotra.

774
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,290
Go! Go wherever you like!

775
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,457
In the name of my flowing blood..

776
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:47,582
-in the name of the person
which is written on my heart..

777
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:54,457
-You are mine-only mine-

778
01:24:56,458 --> 01:25:00,832
These rituals round the fire
the hymns-they are all a fraud-

779
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:03,415
Sunil has cheated you-

780
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:06,832
The vermilion that he
has put on your hair-

781
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:09,832
will be washed away
with his own blood.

782
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,582
That's a promise!

783
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,874
"My mother-"

784
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:05,332
"my mother has sewn
sixteen buttons on my blouse"

785
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,874
"Dear father.."

786
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:16,832
"Father hurry up and see me
off in a bridal palanquin soon"

787
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:24,332
"my mother has sewn
sixteen buttons on my blouse"

788
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,499
"Dear father.."

789
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:41,374
"Father hurry up and see me
off in a bridal palanquin soon"

790
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:49,374
"Seventeen bells in my anklets.."

791
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:54,624
"for I've turned seventeen"

792
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:57,249
"This is the age-"

793
01:26:57,333 --> 01:27:11,999
"This was the age when Sohni
fell in love with Mahiwal"

794
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:21,332
"My hands-"

795
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:25,082
"I wear eighteen bangles.."

796
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:29,749
"and I keep dancing"

797
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:49,749
"I've abandoned my modesty
to dance with gay abandon"

798
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:17,249
"In a fake beard and moustache.."

799
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:21,207
"the wicked one really deceived me"

800
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:39,790
"He came in the disguise of
a tailor and took my measurements"

801
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:46,207
"How do I give? How do I give?"

802
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:52,790
"How will I give away my
heart to you my love?"

803
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:57,540
"My heart isn't trivia"

804
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:07,624
"How am I to accept your bangles?
It could be a ploy you're using"

805
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:18,749
"I didn't approve of any suitor-"

806
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:23,290
"I refused to get married"

807
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:34,165
"But when his name came up..
I agreed immediately"

808
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:58,957
"From my piercing eyes-"

809
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:03,499
"he has stolen what they possessed"

810
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:08,749
"I stepped out of the
lake after a bath-"

811
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:12,915
"and he took away a picture of mine"

812
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:19,082
"Give him something-
- What?"

813
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:27,749
"Give him something and ask him
to return your picture to you"

814
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:46,082
"Do it before he hangs
your picture at the square"

815
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:17,290
Ravi Shastri was awarded an
Audi for 'Man Of The Series'.

816
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,874
I'm not giving you an Audi..

817
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,499
-but someone who is
dearer to me than my life.

818
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:29,415
Take care of her.
- Brother..

819
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,540
You take care of me-

820
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:54,624
From this point commences
a new story.

821
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:01,040
These two constables will
remain with you for your safety-

822
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:05,582
They are not necessary. I can protect
Kiran and myself on my own.

823
01:32:05,875 --> 01:32:08,207
One should always remain on
the guard from the unseen enemy.

824
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:10,082
As it is they will stay outside-

825
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:16,582
You may take the lift.
- Yes-

826
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:19,249
And us?

827
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:22,957
It's a custom among us that when the
bride comes home for the first time..

828
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:26,332
-the bridegroom lifts her
and takes her inside the home.

829
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:30,249
Think it over. Our home
is on the 7th floor..

830
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:31,790
-and I am quite heavy.

831
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,665
If you are prepared to
give me the labour charges-

832
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:39,332
-I am prepared to lift this
weight right upto the 50th floor.

833
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:43,082
What labour charge do you desire?

834
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:45,749
Love on every step!

835
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,624
You're tired aren't you?
- You forgot.

836
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,957
What?
- My labour charge.

837
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,040
Just a minute-just a minute-
- What happened?

838
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:19,207
My sandal!

839
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:31,832
Hey! This is cheating.

840
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:33,874
You've already taken the
labour charge for this step.

841
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,874
This is overtime. It was not within
the contract to pick up the sandal-

842
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,207
I see.. I see-

843
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,874
If I could have my way
I would never have allowed you to..

844
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:46,749
-take a home at such a height.
- If I could have my way..

845
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:49,124
I would've bought a home on the sky.
Then I would've-

846
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:51,415
continued to climb the stairs all
my life with you close to my heart.

847
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,082
Go upstairs!

848
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:47,082
Congratulations on the marriage-

849
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:49,790
I suppose you are all right!

850
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,707
Congratulations on the marriage-

851
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,499
Congratulations on the marriage-

852
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:04,707
Congratulations-

853
01:35:17,166 --> 01:35:24,540
"it's a small house but.."

854
01:35:26,166 --> 01:35:31,249
"I hope you will like it"

855
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:45,124
"You're mine Kiran"

856
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:50,665
"Don't ever belong to someone else.."

857
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:56,665
"or I could go to any lengths
that's how crazy I am"

858
01:35:57,125 --> 01:36:02,749
"From the skies I will seek you"

859
01:36:03,083 --> 01:36:08,624
"From this world
I shall snatch you away"

860
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:11,790
"Say yes.."

861
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:14,749
"or say no.."

862
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:20,915
"whether you say yes or no
you're mine Kiran-"

863
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:28,165
"you're mine Kiran"

864
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,499
What happened?

865
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:46,999
Look there!
He is telephoning me again!

866
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:50,332
Nobody is telephoning.
Nobody is telephoning.

867
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,082
No.

868
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:57,082
Come on-rise!

869
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:08,040
You didn't hear any bell?
- No I heard nothing.

870
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:11,915
Come on-be seated-

871
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:16,915
Look! The phone is ringing again.
Are you hearing the bell?

872
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,749
Don't lift the phone.

873
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,040
I know whose phone it is.
Don't lift the phone.

874
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:25,332
I had disconnected the line-

875
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,207
I didn't want anybody
to disturb you.

876
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:34,957
Darling nobody is telephoning-

877
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:39,832
No one-

878
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,415
Nobody is telephoning?
- No.

879
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:45,040
Then-

880
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:50,665
Save me. I don't want to turn mad-

881
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:54,499
Please save me.
I don't want to become mad.

882
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:03,665
I don't want to become mad.

883
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:06,874
Please save me.

884
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:16,790
I want to resign.

885
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:21,124
You are a marine Commando.

886
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:25,457
And it is our tradition that
when the ship is sinking-

887
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:28,165
-even then the captain
doesn't leave the ship.

888
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:32,082
There's an ordinary
storm in your life and..

889
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:35,915
-you want to give up everything?
What kind of an officer are you?

890
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:40,290
Face the storm and
bring your ship to the shore-

891
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:42,957
But Sir..

892
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:45,665
I will try and get
your leave extended.

893
01:38:46,333 --> 01:38:49,249
You will do me such
a big obligation?

894
01:38:49,333 --> 01:38:50,415
It's not an obligation.

895
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:53,540
I don't want to lose
a good officer like you.

896
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:57,832
I will come back as
soon as Kiran recovers.

897
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:00,165
Where are you taking her?

898
01:39:00,625 --> 01:39:04,249
I haven't decided. But I want
to take her somewhere far away-

899
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:11,082
Just remember this thing.

900
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:12,999
As long as the fruit is
on the tree it looks good

901
01:39:13,375 --> 01:39:15,332
Once it is in one's hands
it's right place is between the teeth.

902
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:18,582
When a lover becomes a husband
he changes colours.

903
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:22,832
No! My Sunil will never change-
- Is it?

904
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:26,290
What happened?
- Why're you weeping?

905
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:30,082
By seeing both of you
leaving for a honeymoon-

906
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:32,082
-I've been reminded of
my honeymoon.

907
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,249
You had been to a honeymoon?
- Yes-

908
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:36,874
Where?
- To Brabourne Stadium-

909
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:41,165
Nobody must've celebrated
his honeymoon the way I did-

910
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,457
Shameless fellow. Does one
tell people about one's honeymoon?

911
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:46,665
I had celebrated my honeymoon
in public. Do you know how?

912
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,624
You had even celebrated-?
What did you do?

913
01:39:50,916 --> 01:39:53,832
It was night time.
The flood-lights were on.

914
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,749
The invitees were on
the pitch. And then..

915
01:39:57,833 --> 01:40:00,624
In the presence of everybody?
- He's lying. An absolute lie!

916
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:03,040
One speaks the truth only
during a cricket commentary.

917
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:05,207
Because there's no chance of lying!

918
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:11,165
We're leaving.
- Carry on. You've my best wishes.

919
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:13,499
May the Lord make you
successful in this test match itself-

920
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:22,874
Bless you.
- Brother..

921
01:40:23,916 --> 01:40:25,040
Sister-in-law..

922
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,790
You'll receive a beating!
- I too will touch her feet!

923
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:38,374
How could you start talking
about our honeymoon night?

924
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,499
You just can't keep
your tongue under check!

925
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:56,207
Please tell me on which flight are
Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra traveling-

926
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:59,040
It's difficult to give out
information about passengers.

927
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:03,207
I've to give a very
important message to them.

928
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:06,082
I cannot reveal about them.

929
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:18,540
All right Madam.
You perform your duty.

930
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:23,915
But remember-an innocent
child who has just been orphaned..

931
01:41:25,083 --> 01:41:29,790
-a young girl who has been
widowed just an hour ago-

932
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,957
-they will never pardon you-

933
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:36,124
What are you saying?
- Yes Madam-

934
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:41,040
Your passengers Mr. and Mrs.
Malhotra will curse you-

935
01:41:41,916 --> 01:41:43,874
Because they will be
celebrating their honeymoon there..

936
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:48,082
-and his brother will
be cremated by strangers.

937
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,499
Has Mr. Malhotra's
brother passed away?

938
01:41:52,583 --> 01:41:55,124
Yes Madam. That's why
I've come rushing here.

939
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:57,374
It's very important to
convey this message to Sunil-

940
01:41:58,083 --> 01:41:59,165
I will just check.

941
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:09,332
Yes. But the flight
has already taken off.

942
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:11,790
The message cannot be conveyed.
- It doesn't matter.

943
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:13,957
I will personally go to Goa.
- Yes-

944
01:42:23,916 --> 01:42:26,499
I'm coming Kiran.

945
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:31,540
Tell me something-we came till here.
But we didn't go to Goa- Why?

946
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:34,207
We're not going to Goa
but to Switzerland.

947
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:38,207
Really?
- Yes-

948
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:41,040
Our flight will take off from the
International Airport in 2 hours.

949
01:42:43,333 --> 01:42:45,082
Then why did you
purchase these tickets to Goa?

950
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:48,207
Because now I have started
thinking like that scoundrel!

951
01:42:49,166 --> 01:42:51,624
By now he must have
checked that we've gone to Goa-

952
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,790
And he must be
preparing to leave for Goa.

953
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:56,249
He will reach Goa
and we will reach Switzerland.

954
01:42:57,916 --> 01:43:03,707
I like you a lot when
you speak so intelligently-

955
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:15,790
Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra
aren't staying in our hotel.

956
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:21,457
Are Mr. and Mrs.-
Malhotra staying in your hotel?

957
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:23,165
Why're you asking?

958
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,165
I'm their friend-
I've come to meet them.

959
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:27,874
Did your friend not give
you the right address?

960
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:30,374
He did give the address.
But I've lost it.

961
01:43:30,708 --> 01:43:32,082
That's why I'm
searching in every hotel.

962
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:35,249
What's the need to search
for them in every hotel?

963
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:37,165
Do you intend to collect your dues?

964
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:40,332
Just check and tell me if
Sunil Malhotra is staying here!

965
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,707
You're screaming at me?
Now I will never tell you.

966
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:45,915
Please don't be angry.

967
01:43:48,541 --> 01:43:52,707
Please check and tell me if Mr. and
Mrs. Malhotra are staying here.

968
01:43:56,333 --> 01:43:58,415
There's no Malhotra here.

969
01:44:00,416 --> 01:44:04,415
From where do such
people come and harass me?

970
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:19,082
Who are you to stop me?
Pour four glasses into it-

971
01:44:19,125 --> 01:44:22,582
It will spill over Sir.
- So be it. It's my liquor.

972
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:25,957
What do have you got to do with it?
I'm paying for it. Come on- Pour!

973
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:27,415
Come on!

974
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:41,582
How come you are here?

975
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:43,790
We never met after college!
- Yes-

976
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:46,957
How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

977
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:49,082
I'm fine-

978
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:52,457
After meeting you
I am reminded of our college days.

979
01:44:52,541 --> 01:44:59,790
Jokes fun mischief all day long!

980
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:04,790
Get it get it!

981
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:14,624
What are you doing?

982
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:16,665
Forget it.

983
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:19,249
If this intoxication
were not there..

984
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:22,082
-it would be difficult
to live life.

985
01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:29,207
You tell me! What happened of that
girl of whom you were crazy about?

986
01:45:29,666 --> 01:45:33,207
Did you get her or not?
- I will get her.

987
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,499
Make sure you call me.

988
01:45:36,416 --> 01:45:39,374
The letters written by you
which you deposited with me..

989
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:43,249
-all her belongings which
you had deposited with me..

990
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:45,415
-even today
all those things are with me.

991
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:48,499
I will present it to her.

992
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:52,749
And if I pass away
give it to her as a gift from me.

993
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:56,290
Come on now!
Don't speak of death!

994
01:45:57,375 --> 01:45:59,124
You've to live for a long time.

995
01:46:00,375 --> 01:46:01,457
It's tough.

996
01:46:02,875 --> 01:46:04,457
The liver is not efficient.

997
01:46:06,166 --> 01:46:08,040
The heart too is in
a delicate state.

998
01:46:08,625 --> 01:46:13,082
There's a cat-and-mouse game
going on between me and life.

999
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:17,624
God knows when the rat
will catch the mouse.

1000
01:46:33,125 --> 01:46:34,790
What was the name of
your girlfriend?

1001
01:47:12,083 --> 01:47:16,082
"It's etched on the winds"

1002
01:47:16,208 --> 01:47:19,957
"It's inscribed on the mountains"

1003
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:27,332

01:47:28,416 --> 01:47:32,415

01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:36,165

1006
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:44,457
"You and I are made

1007
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:18,082
"For this beautiful
legend of love.."

1008
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:22,207
"you and I have
descended from the skies"

1009
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:26,207
"These moments and
the stories of love.."

1010
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:30,582
"bring two youngsters together"

1011
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:34,832
"Together we tread
the path of love"

1012
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:38,999
"It's etched on the winds"

1013
01:48:39,083 --> 01:48:43,040

1014
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:51,582
"You and I are made for each other"

1015
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:19,915
"Keep smiling just like this.."

1016
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:24,207
"biting the end of
your scarf in shyness"

1017
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:28,124
"Do away with the
veil of your tresses-"

1018
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:32,457
"let me see your pretty face"

1019
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:36,415
"Proud lithesome.."

1020
01:49:36,833 --> 01:49:40,624
"walk up to me-"

1021
01:49:40,916 --> 01:49:44,790
"for these are the
traits I so dearly love"

1022
01:49:45,166 --> 01:49:49,082
"It's all over the winds"

1023
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:53,124
"The mountains bear testimony"

1024
01:49:53,458 --> 01:50:01,415
"You and I are made for each other"

1025
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,665
"Let's tell the world today.."

1026
01:50:41,958 --> 01:50:45,832
"we love each other
more than our own lives"

1027
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:49,874
"In the victory and
defeat of love.."

1028
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:53,915
"of what consequence is
my heart.."

1029
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:58,165
"I've laid my life at your feet"

1030
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:02,249
"It's all over the winds"

1031
01:51:02,541 --> 01:51:06,582
"The mountains bear testimony"

1032
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:13,915
"You and I..
- Are made for each other"

1033
01:51:14,916 --> 01:51:18,915
"It's etched on the winds"

1034
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,082
"It's inscribed on the mountains"

1035
01:51:23,166 --> 01:51:31,207
"You and I are made for each other"

1036
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:08,290
It's a sixer!

1037
01:52:15,666 --> 01:52:16,749
I'm Rahul!

1038
01:52:17,166 --> 01:52:19,415
Fool! You've dropped
a simple catch!

1039
01:52:20,083 --> 01:52:23,082
Captain Mehra is my father-
- I see-Sunil's boss!

1040
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:32,915
Looks like you are
very fond of cricket.

1041
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,249
You're also playing?
- I don't play now-

1042
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:37,749
I used to play in Chandigarh
on behalf of Punjab University.

1043
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:41,249
How is Sunil?
- Where is he playing?

1044
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:45,540
Not Gavaskar- Your Sunil-
- You didn't attend the wedding?

1045
01:52:45,916 --> 01:52:48,082
No I wasn't in town.
Where is he these days?

1046
01:52:48,541 --> 01:52:51,082
Where does a man go after marriage?
In the heaven of dreams.

1047
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:53,207
He has gone on a honeymoon?
- Yes-

1048
01:52:53,458 --> 01:52:54,582
Where?

1049
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,374
You were asking something?

1050
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:05,540
You were telling me
where Sunil has gone-

1051
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:08,332
He must've gone-Hey!
This wicket is very important.

1052
01:53:33,833 --> 01:53:35,124
Whatever you say..

1053
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:38,374
-but if any of their player had
struck a four in the final overs..

1054
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:41,082
-their team was sure to win.
- That's what I was telling you.

1055
01:53:41,375 --> 01:53:43,624
If I was a part of the team we
would’ve surely won the match.

1056
01:53:43,708 --> 01:53:46,082
You always say that if you played
we would have won.

1057
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:48,165
Don't you interfere!
It's because of you that-

1058
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:50,582
-I'm not a part of the Indian team
along with Gavaskar and Kapil Dev-

1059
01:53:50,666 --> 01:53:52,290
Why?
- She put forth a condition..

1060
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:54,124
-that either I should marry her
or join the Indian team-

1061
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:57,040
What proof did you have whether
you know how to play cricket?

1062
01:53:57,083 --> 01:53:58,874
The proof is that I got married to
you. And another problem was that-

1063
01:53:59,083 --> 01:54:01,499
-there had to be someone to
look after my sister Kiran.

1064
01:54:01,625 --> 01:54:04,082
Now you've come to the point!
- What's the need to say that?

1065
01:54:05,916 --> 01:54:08,332
Sunil too appeared
worried before marriage.

1066
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:10,499
Daddy was saying that
some boy telephones-

1067
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:12,082
-your sister and harasses her

1068
01:54:12,625 --> 01:54:17,582
Dog! Rascal! Scoundrel!
He's not a boy he's a ghost!

1069
01:54:17,833 --> 01:54:21,249
He had made life difficult for us.
Whenever the phone bell rang..

1070
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:23,915
we used to get panicky-
Kiran had even become half-mad.

1071
01:54:24,958 --> 01:54:26,874
Just see he will die such a death-

1072
01:54:26,958 --> 01:54:29,790
-that even dogs
wouldn’t touch his dead body.

1073
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,165
He has been cursed by me.

1074
01:54:33,208 --> 01:54:36,707
She had cursed me too.
And I became her husband!

1075
01:54:36,958 --> 01:54:39,124
What? Is it a curse
to become my husband?

1076
01:54:39,208 --> 01:54:42,124
It's a curse to be a husband.
- It's a greater curse to be a wife-

1077
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,457
Everything is fine
after marriage isn't it?

1078
01:54:51,541 --> 01:54:53,540
Yes.
- Everything is fine so far.

1079
01:54:54,333 --> 01:54:56,415
But who can trust a scoundrel
and a blackmailer like him?

1080
01:54:56,708 --> 01:55:00,665
He can come any time- And who knows
he might throttle Poonam to death!

1081
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:03,374
What nonsense! Why would
he throttle me to death?

1082
01:55:03,666 --> 01:55:05,540
To know the
whereabouts of Sunil and Kiran.

1083
01:55:05,958 --> 01:55:08,082
They've gone away hidden from him.
He must be trying to find out..

1084
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:11,082
-where his victims have
escaped from his clutches.

1085
01:55:11,208 --> 01:55:13,624
Isn't it Rahul?
- Yes-

1086
01:55:14,833 --> 01:55:17,082
He must be trying his best to find
out where they must've gone away.

1087
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:21,499
But I'm convinced that they
must have gone to a place-

1088
01:55:21,833 --> 01:55:23,790
-which is not known
to anybody besides you-

1089
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:28,124
Absolutely right- And we won't
tell anybody where they've gone.

1090
01:55:28,208 --> 01:55:29,832
Sunil has made me take an oath.

1091
01:55:31,916 --> 01:55:33,832
Sunil proved to be
smarter than I had thought.

1092
01:55:35,375 --> 01:55:38,499
I should be leaving now-
- Do visit again.

1093
01:55:38,916 --> 01:55:40,874
Sure.
- And convey my regards to Mr. Mehra-

1094
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:50,832
He's a nice boy-
- Beware!

1095
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:53,082
Don't ever praise another
boy in my presence. Am I dead?

1096
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,582
If you had loved me I would've been
playing cricket in the Indian team.

1097
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:59,624
You've started it again!
- What else should I talk about?

1098
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:00,790
You just talk about cricket!

1099
01:56:00,875 --> 01:56:03,249
Don't you scold me like Lala
Amarnath! - Now that's enough!

1100
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:08,249
Sir a Mr. Vicky had telephoned
5 to 6 times. He was asking for you-

1101
01:56:08,416 --> 01:56:09,915
He said it is urgent.
He has called you home-

1102
01:56:10,708 --> 01:56:11,832
Vicky?
- Yes-

1103
01:56:25,666 --> 01:56:29,665
Your condition is very critical.
I will send for an ambulance.

1104
01:56:30,041 --> 01:56:31,374
No..no-

1105
01:56:37,958 --> 01:56:40,582
Pick up that box.

1106
01:56:43,375 --> 01:56:45,874
You had kept it with me
during the college days.

1107
01:56:47,416 --> 01:56:51,082
It contains letters
which you wrote to Kiran-

1108
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,582
-but you never posted them.

1109
01:56:56,750 --> 01:57:00,374
The college days
were such good days..

1110
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:03,374
It was lively enjoyable..

1111
01:57:04,666 --> 01:57:08,332
No fear no pains nor any hassles..

1112
01:57:15,166 --> 01:57:20,499
Tell everybody that the smoke that
comes out of a narcotic cigarette-

1113
01:57:22,666 --> 01:57:23,999
-it is not smoke-

1114
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:29,207
-it is a swaying snake..

1115
01:57:32,291 --> 01:57:34,999
-which has engulfed my body.

1116
01:57:37,375 --> 01:57:43,082
But now the poison has spread-

1117
01:57:46,041 --> 01:57:48,999
What have I done in life?

1118
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:53,082
Nothing.. I could do nothing.

1119
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:57,915
Neither could I be a good son
nor a good brother-

1120
01:57:59,125 --> 01:58:02,749
Neither could I love anybody
nor could I belong to anyone-

1121
01:58:03,416 --> 01:58:05,582
And now-when I..

1122
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:21,207
Do something.. death-

1123
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:27,249
Throttle me to death. Let me go.

1124
01:58:46,583 --> 01:58:51,374
No.. your life will not go waste.

1125
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:09,749
My Kiran-for whom
I was living till today..

1126
01:59:09,833 --> 01:59:14,665
she married somebody else. So there is
no point in staying alive-

1127
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,540
Kiran I tried to convince you
about my love in every possible way.

1128
01:59:17,666 --> 01:59:20,707
But you didn't agree.
Perhaps my death might convince you.

1129
01:59:21,916 --> 01:59:23,749
Yours and only yours-
..Vicky-

1130
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:26,999
The scoundrel is dead!

1131
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,665
He has hit a four!

1132
01:59:40,041 --> 01:59:42,040
Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

1133
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:45,707
Why do you dress up and
watch cricket matches?

1134
01:59:46,333 --> 01:59:47,999
Considering our team's
condition these days-

1135
01:59:48,458 --> 01:59:51,415
-I feel that they
can need me any time.

1136
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:52,957
That's why
I always keep myself ready-

1137
01:59:58,791 --> 02:00:01,707
Congratulations Sir.
- What for? It's a matter of shame.

1138
02:00:01,833 --> 02:00:04,499
They've scored just
102 runs in 40 overs.

1139
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:07,040
If I had been in their place
I would've committed suicide.

1140
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:10,790
Come on More-Hit! Gosh!
More is out! They're all out!

1141
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:12,749
I don't understand
the ways of cricket.

1142
02:00:12,875 --> 02:00:15,124
I've brought news about
someone else's suicide.

1143
02:00:15,208 --> 02:00:17,290
Suicide? Who committed suicide?

1144
02:00:17,583 --> 02:00:20,124
Last night your
fear committed suicide.

1145
02:00:20,208 --> 02:00:22,790
Suicide? You mean.. a hit wicket?

1146
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:27,082
The boy who used to telephone
Kiran and frighten her-he is dead?

1147
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,582
Yes.

1148
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:31,957
Are you fully convinced that
the person who died is the one?

1149
02:00:32,041 --> 02:00:33,165
We have got all the evidences.

1150
02:00:33,458 --> 02:00:36,582
Kiran's photographs
letters telephone numbers-

1151
02:00:36,666 --> 02:00:39,082
-and the last letter
written by him.

1152
02:00:39,541 --> 02:00:44,082
He has written that he is committing
suicide since Kiran married Sunil.

1153
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,582
What was his name?
- Vikram Oberoi.

1154
02:00:50,208 --> 02:00:52,249
Didn't I say that
my curse wouldn't go waste?

1155
02:00:52,333 --> 02:00:55,540
Her curse is like Kapil's ball-
It hit the wicket and he died!

1156
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:59,249
This is very good news.
Sunil will be glad to hear it.

1157
02:00:59,333 --> 02:01:02,665
Yes. Rahul is right- You had better
telephone Switzerland right away.

1158
02:01:02,875 --> 02:01:04,040
Okay just a minute.

1159
02:01:04,083 --> 02:01:05,624
All right then. I'm leaving.

1160
02:01:09,625 --> 02:01:10,707
Excuse me-

1161
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:19,415
What's the matter? You're
looking at me very attentively-

1162
02:01:20,125 --> 02:01:21,457
I've seen you somewhere before.

1163
02:01:22,833 --> 02:01:25,207
5 feet 10. Hospital!

1164
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:28,040
Absolutely right-
You are Mr. Sunil's friend.

1165
02:01:28,333 --> 02:01:30,540
Yes.
- You're Kiran's friend too?

1166
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:35,124
No. I've never met her.

1167
02:01:36,375 --> 02:01:37,540
Do you know Vikram?

1168
02:01:43,208 --> 02:01:44,374
All right. You may go.

1169
02:01:45,291 --> 02:01:47,540
Lost.. the match!

1170
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:49,582
I suppose you won't forget me now-
- Not at all.

1171
02:01:51,375 --> 02:01:53,582
Tell me-what's the
phone number of Sunil?

1172
02:02:01,958 --> 02:02:03,707
Is this right?
- Yes-

1173
02:02:03,791 --> 02:02:05,707
But move a little this way.

1174
02:02:07,541 --> 02:02:10,082
This is nice.
But move a little further this way.

1175
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:13,874
I should move away further?
..all right how's this?

1176
02:02:14,083 --> 02:02:17,082
Now it is looking good.
But a little this way.

1177
02:02:17,125 --> 02:02:21,499
My hair is fine isn't it?
- You're looking very beautiful.

1178
02:02:21,583 --> 02:02:24,207
Move a little away and you
will look even more beautiful-

1179
02:02:27,458 --> 02:02:30,665
Wow! You're looking very beautiful-

1180
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:34,082
You were never more beautiful.

1181
02:02:36,041 --> 02:02:39,499
Gosh! You're looking so beautiful.

1182
02:02:39,916 --> 02:02:42,374
I never knew that you
looked so beautiful in camera!

1183
02:02:42,541 --> 02:02:43,624
Really!

1184
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,790
You're looking very beautiful!

1185
02:02:47,416 --> 02:02:49,999
I'm looking very beautiful is it?
- Yes- You're looking very beautiful.

1186
02:02:50,125 --> 02:02:52,832
Are you coming closer to me?
- Yes I'm coming closer.

1187
02:02:52,916 --> 02:02:54,374
So you are zooming in on me?

1188
02:02:54,458 --> 02:02:56,290
What do you think about this pose?
Shall I lift my legs?

1189
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,790
Yes. Lift your legs.
- I'll remove the shoes too.

1190
02:02:58,875 --> 02:03:01,582
Yes remove the shoes.
They don't look good.

1191
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:02,874
What do you think of this pose?

1192
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:11,624
This pose is also nice.
But move away your shoes a bit.

1193
02:03:11,708 --> 02:03:14,207
I will give you a beating.
You were taking my pictures!

1194
02:03:14,291 --> 02:03:16,915
You were watching those girls!
And you asked me to move further huh!

1195
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,040
You know my camera was
on them what can I do?

1196
02:06:54,916 --> 02:06:56,040
Don't lift the phone.

1197
02:06:57,791 --> 02:06:59,707
Brother! It's brother on the phone!

1198
02:06:59,916 --> 02:07:01,749
Your brother has good timing.

1199
02:07:02,958 --> 02:07:04,290
You proceed- I'll join you.

1200
02:07:05,166 --> 02:07:06,249
Brother!

1201
02:07:07,583 --> 02:07:08,707
There's good news.

1202
02:07:09,458 --> 02:07:11,749
The boy who used to harass
you has been out hit-wicket.

1203
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:13,540
Tell her clearly.
- He has committed suicide-

1204
02:07:13,625 --> 02:07:15,249
Hey that's what I am trying to
tell her! He has committed suicide?

1205
02:07:15,333 --> 02:07:16,457
He has committed suicide?

1206
02:07:18,833 --> 02:07:21,040
When did all this happen?
- Last night.

1207
02:07:21,083 --> 02:07:22,165
But who was he?

1208
02:07:24,291 --> 02:07:27,082
Who Vicky? I don't know any-

1209
02:07:27,916 --> 02:07:30,499
I see.. in Shimla! That must be one!

1210
02:07:30,875 --> 02:07:34,124
There couldn't have
been better news.

1211
02:07:34,583 --> 02:07:36,082
Just a minute-speak here.

1212
02:07:38,375 --> 02:07:41,082
How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1213
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:44,124
Everybody is fine here. Whatever
your brother has said is true.

1214
02:07:44,416 --> 02:07:46,915
Don't take any tension-
And how is Sunil?

1215
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:48,624
Give him a lot of love.

1216
02:07:49,916 --> 02:07:52,332
And when are you returning?
- We will be back soon-

1217
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:54,374
I'll convey the good news to Sunil.

1218
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,790
The phone has been disconnected.

1219
02:08:00,833 --> 02:08:01,915
I just told you to hold it for me!

1220
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,790
You keep on talking rubbish.
You never speak the real thing.

1221
02:08:05,125 --> 02:08:11,332
He's dead!

1222
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:14,540
Who's dead?
- The one who telephoned.

1223
02:08:16,875 --> 02:08:20,290
Yes. Brother just telephoned-
He is dead-

1224
02:08:21,541 --> 02:08:24,415
I doubt it-
- About what?

1225
02:08:25,208 --> 02:08:29,040
Such a scoundrel such a rascal
he harassed so much-

1226
02:08:29,458 --> 02:08:30,874
He died so easily?

1227
02:08:32,458 --> 02:08:36,040
Don't talk like this.
Don't scare e.

1228
02:08:45,833 --> 02:08:47,040
Will you eat so much?

1229
02:08:48,916 --> 02:08:49,999
You begin.

1230
02:09:06,666 --> 02:09:10,124
Who has sent it?
- It's addressed to me.

1231
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:24,499
This is the scoundrel
who used to harass us.

1232
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:28,249
He was sitting behind you
at the Holiday Inn that day.

1233
02:09:28,625 --> 02:09:32,040
I know him. He was in my college-

1234
02:09:33,166 --> 02:09:34,457
He used to telephone?

1235
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:38,457
But he never even
spoke to me at college.

1236
02:09:39,541 --> 02:09:42,165
I could never have imagined
that he was such a mad person.

1237
02:09:45,125 --> 02:09:46,207
He's dead!

1238
02:09:47,666 --> 02:09:50,040
He's dead.
- You're at fault.

1239
02:09:50,541 --> 02:09:51,707
Why?

1240
02:09:51,958 --> 02:09:54,332
You're so beautiful
that people go mad-

1241
02:09:54,916 --> 02:09:57,915
I fear that there must be others
who must be dreaming about you-

1242
02:09:58,625 --> 02:10:00,540
What would happen
if they start telephoning you?

1243
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:02,915
Here comes the phone.

1244
02:10:08,791 --> 02:10:11,165
Who is it?
- It got disconnected.

1245
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,624
Didn't I tell you that some new
lover wants to hear your voice?

1246
02:10:15,708 --> 02:10:20,082
You're joking again? You know
that I'm scared of such things-

1247
02:10:21,291 --> 02:10:23,332
Let's go sight-seeing.

1248
02:10:46,583 --> 02:10:51,249
"The distances between
us are vanishing.."

1249
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:56,582
"we're being drawn
closer to each other"

1250
02:10:57,375 --> 02:11:01,790
"From the skies I will seek you"

1251
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:07,707
"From this world
I shall snatch you away"

1252
02:11:08,208 --> 02:11:10,165
"Say yes.."

1253
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:12,957
"or say no.."

1254
02:11:13,625 --> 02:11:18,374
"whether you say yes or no
you're mine Kiran-"

1255
02:11:19,041 --> 02:11:21,332
"you're mine Kiran"

1256
02:11:21,708 --> 02:11:25,665
"Your eyes are sheer magic"

1257
02:11:26,875 --> 02:11:31,457
"Yours is an enchanting scent"

1258
02:11:32,416 --> 02:11:34,332
"Say yes.."

1259
02:11:34,791 --> 02:11:37,207
"or say no.."

1260
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:42,749
"whether you agree or disagree
you're mine Kiran"

1261
02:11:42,958 --> 02:11:51,082
"you're mine Kiran"

1262
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:03,374
Shut your eyes-

1263
02:12:05,125 --> 02:12:06,415
Move forward your hand.

1264
02:12:08,166 --> 02:12:09,290
You're tying rakhi?

1265
02:12:12,875 --> 02:12:16,290
Look now. How do you find it?
- It's fine.

1266
02:12:18,166 --> 02:12:21,624
But it beats like your heart.
- Now look at its marvel.

1267
02:12:25,916 --> 02:12:28,040
Hey! Where is this signal
coming from?

1268
02:12:28,666 --> 02:12:31,290
I'm giving you the signal.
I've a similar watch with me.

1269
02:12:31,791 --> 02:12:34,165
You press the red button.
I will receive the signal.

1270
02:12:39,291 --> 02:12:41,374
I understand.
You've given me this watch-

1271
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,874
-so that I don't run away
from you-

1272
02:12:43,166 --> 02:12:47,040
No no. I gave it to you so
that when you are alone-

1273
02:12:47,125 --> 02:12:48,790
-and you remember me
just push this button.

1274
02:12:49,208 --> 02:12:51,082
I will come rushing to you.

1275
02:14:18,083 --> 02:14:22,124
I was only joking with you.
And you broke my teeth!

1276
02:14:23,416 --> 02:14:24,540
I thought that..

1277
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:26,915
Anyway how come you are here?

1278
02:14:27,375 --> 02:14:30,249
I had come here on Daddy's work-
What're you doing here?

1279
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:33,165
You must've come here to celebrate
your honeymoon haven't you?

1280
02:14:34,041 --> 02:14:37,457
You didn't attend the wedding.
Come I'll introduce you to my wife.

1281
02:14:37,541 --> 02:14:38,665
Take it easy!

1282
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:44,082
This is Rahul Captain Mehra's son-

1283
02:14:52,875 --> 02:14:56,207
I haven't changed so much
that you couldn't recognise me.

1284
02:14:57,958 --> 02:15:02,165
Do you know each other?
- We've studied in the same college.

1285
02:15:04,833 --> 02:15:08,915
You haven't changed any bit.
You continue to blush like ever-

1286
02:15:13,208 --> 02:15:15,207
I've enjoyed meeting you.

1287
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:17,249
If one meets someone
from your own country..

1288
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:20,374
-one begins to feel at home
even in a foreign country.

1289
02:15:21,083 --> 02:15:22,457
There's nothing like your own
country or a foreign country.

1290
02:15:23,083 --> 02:15:24,874
If one's own people are
there in a foreign country..

1291
02:15:25,083 --> 02:15:26,499
-it becomes your own country.

1292
02:15:27,166 --> 02:15:28,874
Otherwise even our own country
feels like a foreign country.

1293
02:15:29,083 --> 02:15:33,040
Then why didn't you marry?
- Not everyone is lucky like you are.

1294
02:15:33,166 --> 02:15:37,207
That's not the case.
You are hiding the truth.

1295
02:15:38,166 --> 02:15:39,665
Do you know what the truth is?

1296
02:15:40,125 --> 02:15:44,290
The whole of college knew that
Rahul is crazy about some girl.

1297
02:15:44,791 --> 02:15:48,790
But nobody knew who that
girl was. All of us tried a lot.

1298
02:15:49,083 --> 02:15:52,957
But the secret was never revealed-
- Come on tell us now-

1299
02:15:54,916 --> 02:15:58,082
Even that girl doesn't know.
- How can she?

1300
02:15:58,458 --> 02:16:00,124
You must have never told her.

1301
02:16:02,583 --> 02:16:04,124
Tell us now who she is.

1302
02:16:05,666 --> 02:16:06,832
She has got married.

1303
02:16:08,833 --> 02:16:10,415
It means the story comes to an end.

1304
02:16:11,416 --> 02:16:13,832
The story has yet come to an end-
- What do you mean?

1305
02:16:16,125 --> 02:16:17,790
I'm thinking of killing her husband.

1306
02:16:19,083 --> 02:16:20,415
That's like a brave man!

1307
02:16:28,291 --> 02:16:30,749
You aren't coming for a swim?

1308
02:16:31,208 --> 02:16:34,124
No you may proceed.
- Why? Are you scared of drowning?

1309
02:16:34,583 --> 02:16:36,540
No. I'm scared of drowning alone.

1310
02:18:04,041 --> 02:18:07,082
You're in front of me.
I'm in front of you.

1311
02:18:08,041 --> 02:18:10,457
Should I gaze at you
or make love to you?

1312
02:18:24,541 --> 02:18:29,332
"We're here face to
face with each other"

1313
02:18:29,666 --> 02:18:33,499
"Should I gaze at you
or make love to you?"

1314
02:18:34,208 --> 02:18:38,832
"How did this come to be?
You now belong to me-"

1315
02:18:39,208 --> 02:18:43,415
"how am I to believe it?"

1316
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:48,665
You're in front of me.
I'm in front of you.

1317
02:18:48,833 --> 02:18:52,749
Should I gaze at you
or make love to you?

1318
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:57,707
"How did this come to be?
You now belong to me-"

1319
02:18:58,291 --> 02:19:02,499
"how am I to believe it?"

1320
02:19:02,708 --> 02:19:07,415
You're in front of me.
I'm in front of you.

1321
02:19:13,125 --> 02:19:17,165
"I'm shattered
I've gone to pieces-"

1322
02:19:17,625 --> 02:19:22,082
"it's your persistence
that has been my undoing"

1323
02:19:22,791 --> 02:19:26,915
"I'm shattered
I've gone to pieces-"

1324
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:31,790
"it's your persistence
that has been my undoing"

1325
02:19:32,333 --> 02:19:36,957
"Your spell has worked
O magician"

1326
02:19:37,125 --> 02:19:41,540
"I'm shattered
I've gone to pieces-"

1327
02:19:42,083 --> 02:19:45,957
"it's your persistence
that has been my undoing"

1328
02:19:46,291 --> 02:19:50,749
"We're here
face to face with each other"

1329
02:19:51,083 --> 02:19:54,957
"Should I gaze at you
or make love to you?"

1330
02:19:55,500 --> 02:20:00,040
"How did this come to be?
You now belong to me-"

1331
02:20:00,333 --> 02:20:05,082
"how am I to believe my luck?"

1332
02:20:39,250 --> 02:20:43,415
"Your tresses I will play with"

1333
02:20:44,083 --> 02:20:48,082
"I'll gather you in my arms"

1334
02:20:48,833 --> 02:20:53,082
"Your tresses I will play with"

1335
02:20:53,541 --> 02:20:57,790
"I'll gather you in my arms"

1336
02:20:58,291 --> 02:21:02,124
"Every lover gives
away his heart-"

1337
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,332
"but I will lay down
my life for you"

1338
02:21:08,416 --> 02:21:12,332
"Take the redness of my lips.."

1339
02:21:12,583 --> 02:21:17,457
"or the wine that
flows from my eyes"

1340
02:21:17,666 --> 02:21:22,207
"Take the redness of my lips.."

1341
02:21:22,416 --> 02:21:26,790
"or the wine that
flows from my eyes"

1342
02:21:27,208 --> 02:21:32,207
"Your spell has worked on me
O magician"

1343
02:21:32,291 --> 02:21:36,207
"My arrogance lies shattered"

1344
02:21:36,416 --> 02:21:40,957
"Your insistence makes me
helpless"

1345
02:21:41,041 --> 02:21:45,332
"Here we are face to
face with each other"

1346
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:49,499
"Should I just watch
you or make love to you?"

1347
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:54,665
"How did this come to be?
That you now belong to me-"

1348
02:21:55,208 --> 02:21:58,874
"how am I to believe my luck?"

1349
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:37,874
"This story is
a hundred years old-"

1350
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:42,499
"your youth gets better
with time"

1351
02:22:43,166 --> 02:22:47,290
"This story is
a hundred years old-"

1352
02:22:47,875 --> 02:22:51,790
"your youth gets better with time"

1353
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:56,665
"A few moments spent
in your love.."

1354
02:22:57,250 --> 02:23:01,290
"are like a hundred years of
my life"

1355
02:23:02,541 --> 02:23:20,999
"Not once make love
to me a hundred times"

1356
02:23:21,333 --> 02:23:25,915
"Your spell has
worked on me O magician"

1357
02:23:26,166 --> 02:23:30,249
"I am shattered"

1358
02:23:30,833 --> 02:23:34,415
"Against your insistence
I am defenseless"

1359
02:23:34,708 --> 02:23:39,332
"We stand here face to face-"

1360
02:23:39,708 --> 02:23:43,457
"should I just admire
you or make love to you?"

1361
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,374
"How did this come to be?
That you now belong to me-"

1362
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:53,207
"how am I to believe my luck?"

1363
02:24:38,375 --> 02:24:41,082
Look behind!
Two boys are escorting a beauty!

1364
02:24:42,833 --> 02:24:46,207
How wonderful!
One heroine and two heroes!

1365
02:24:49,083 --> 02:24:53,957
We are all prepared to accompany you.
- Take us along- It'll be fun!

1366
02:25:03,541 --> 02:25:07,415
What were you saying?

1367
02:25:15,208 --> 02:25:18,374
Tell me! What were you saying?

1368
02:25:19,708 --> 02:25:24,290
What were you saying?
Repeat it again!

1369
02:25:38,583 --> 02:25:42,790
Why get so angry? You had become mad!
What if that man had died?

1370
02:25:44,166 --> 02:25:48,332
In my opinion people who cross
the limits have no right to live.

1371
02:25:48,791 --> 02:25:50,957
But who are we to set the limits?

1372
02:25:51,333 --> 02:25:53,790
Every human being is free.
He can do what he likes.

1373
02:25:53,958 --> 02:25:59,249
Nobody can misbehave
with a girl in my presence.

1374
02:26:00,083 --> 02:26:01,582
Did you never feel angry?

1375
02:26:03,083 --> 02:26:06,040
I did. I used to be
so furious that-

1376
02:26:06,833 --> 02:26:09,582
-I felt like
smashing that person to bits-

1377
02:26:10,291 --> 02:26:13,999
Stop all this now- I will get
something to cool down tempers.

1378
02:26:15,833 --> 02:26:17,499
Be seated. I will get it.

1379
02:26:18,458 --> 02:26:19,582
What will you bring?

1380
02:26:22,583 --> 02:26:24,082
And bring Coke for me!

1381
02:26:29,916 --> 02:26:33,249
It's such a lovely climate today.
- Yes-

1382
02:26:44,875 --> 02:26:46,582
I'm Vijay speaking.
- It's you?

1383
02:26:46,666 --> 02:26:48,207
How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1384
02:26:48,291 --> 02:26:49,665
I'm fine-
- How about sister-in-law?

1385
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:52,124
She is fine too-
We had quarreled just this morning.

1386
02:26:52,208 --> 02:26:56,082
It means we are still in love.
How is it at your end?

1387
02:26:56,250 --> 02:27:00,790
It's great fun. Ever since Rahul
has come we roam about all day long-

1388
02:27:00,875 --> 02:27:04,915
Who? Rahul? Who's Rahul?

1389
02:27:05,208 --> 02:27:07,124
Captain Mehra's son.

1390
02:27:07,458 --> 02:27:10,082
He reached there too?
- You know Rahul?

1391
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:12,499
Yes. He had come home several
times after you had left.

1392
02:27:12,791 --> 02:27:15,665
But he didn't tell me that
he's going to Switzerland.

1393
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:16,874
How strange?

1394
02:27:18,416 --> 02:27:19,790
Anyhow take care.

1395
02:27:54,166 --> 02:27:56,249
You're really crazy!

1396
02:27:59,750 --> 02:28:02,332
Men have decided that
we will drink liquor till late.

1397
02:28:02,875 --> 02:28:04,707
Ladies may think what
they want to do-

1398
02:28:06,750 --> 02:28:09,082
Ladies have decided that
they will go to sleep-

1399
02:28:09,291 --> 02:28:10,999
Ladies are feeling very tired.

1400
02:28:27,916 --> 02:28:32,374
What's the name of that girl
whom you loved during college days?

1401
02:28:33,083 --> 02:28:35,832
Didn't I tell you that
she has been married?

1402
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,249
Why wasn't she married to you?

1403
02:28:39,250 --> 02:28:42,082
Only she can answer that question.
- Where does she live?

1404
02:28:43,208 --> 02:28:48,707
Earlier she lived in my heart.
I don't know where she is now.

1405
02:28:52,291 --> 02:28:57,082
Did she study in the same college
where you and Kiran studied?

1406
02:28:57,833 --> 02:28:58,999
Yes.

1407
02:29:00,333 --> 02:29:01,415
What's her name?

1408
02:29:06,625 --> 02:29:07,957
What name should I tell you?

1409
02:29:12,875 --> 02:29:14,749
They ask who Ghalib is!

1410
02:29:16,208 --> 02:29:18,957
Somebody should tell
me what I should answer.

1411
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,249
What's her name?

1412
02:29:23,041 --> 02:29:27,665
If I take her name
she will be disgraced.

1413
02:29:31,291 --> 02:29:34,915
Don't ask me the story of my heart.

1414
02:29:41,833 --> 02:29:44,749
The pain of the heart
doesn't get reduced..

1415
02:29:44,833 --> 02:29:47,457
-if it is concealed in liquor
or poetry. In fact it increases-

1416
02:29:48,333 --> 02:29:51,624
One feels comforted when
the issue is spoken out-

1417
02:29:52,833 --> 02:29:57,707
There are some things
which if spoken out..

1418
02:29:58,666 --> 02:30:00,124
-there would be disaster.

1419
02:30:00,625 --> 02:30:04,540
Disaster has to come
some day- Let it come today.

1420
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:09,749
Forget it. Talk about something else.
I want to forget her.

1421
02:30:11,916 --> 02:30:13,624
I'm feeling suspicious about you-

1422
02:30:15,916 --> 02:30:18,082
Suspicious?
- Looks like-

1423
02:30:18,166 --> 02:30:21,415
-you're hiding because
perhaps I know that girl.

1424
02:30:26,458 --> 02:30:30,915
You're a very dangerous person.
Why did you join the navy?

1425
02:30:31,375 --> 02:30:33,999
You should have been in the C.B.I.?

1426
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:37,040
You corner a person
in such a way that..

1427
02:30:37,083 --> 02:30:39,707
-if there were somebody else
he would've revealed everything.

1428
02:30:41,083 --> 02:30:43,707
That's what I want. That
you reveal everything-

1429
02:30:44,583 --> 02:30:46,832
There shouldn't be any
burden on your soul.

1430
02:30:49,916 --> 02:30:50,999
Burden?

1431
02:30:53,208 --> 02:30:55,040
Her memory is not a burden.

1432
02:30:56,291 --> 02:30:57,665
Her memory is a possession.

1433
02:30:59,583 --> 02:31:05,165
Something very beautiful
pleasant and precious.

1434
02:31:07,041 --> 02:31:10,290
It's there with me.
And it will go with me.

1435
02:31:13,625 --> 02:31:15,999
How can I make you
a part of this possession?

1436
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:22,582
I can't even share it with the person
to whom this possession belongs.

1437
02:31:24,458 --> 02:31:26,040
The punishment for the heartbeat..

1438
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:30,665
-stretches for a long distance.

1439
02:31:33,583 --> 02:31:35,249
I'm also leaving.

1440
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:42,415
Your hotel is very far.
Spend the night here itself-

1441
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:47,749
All right. It makes
no difference to me.

1442
02:31:49,375 --> 02:31:50,540
I just have to spend the night.

1443
02:31:52,791 --> 02:31:57,415
Everybody has heard the melody
which comes out of the instrument.

1444
02:32:00,291 --> 02:32:05,082
Which heart knows what has
passed through the breath?

1445
02:32:11,958 --> 02:32:16,124
Everybody has heard the melody
which comes out of the instrument..

1446
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:00,915
Do you know each other?
- We've studied in the same college.

1447
02:33:06,416 --> 02:33:08,165
I'm thinking of killing her husband.

1448
02:33:22,125 --> 02:33:24,874
Don't feel scared-
And don't ask any questions.

1449
02:33:25,125 --> 02:33:28,499
Get ready quietly
and reach the boat.

1450
02:33:29,208 --> 02:33:30,707
I'll meet you there.

1451
02:34:43,291 --> 02:34:45,249
What happened?
- Nobody is answering the phone.

1452
02:34:45,333 --> 02:34:46,874
Where could they have gone
so early in the morning?

1453
02:34:47,041 --> 02:34:48,290
I'm feeling worried.

1454
02:36:29,958 --> 02:36:31,915
You played this tune didn't you?

1455
02:36:34,083 --> 02:36:36,415
Didn't you play this tune?

1456
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,082
Yes.

1457
02:36:44,666 --> 02:36:47,082
You telephoned my Kiran?

1458
02:36:50,458 --> 02:36:51,582
Yes.

1459
02:37:00,041 --> 02:37:03,124
You had tampered with
the brakes of my car.

1460
02:37:04,916 --> 02:37:07,582
It was you who made
the elevator crash.

1461
02:37:08,041 --> 02:37:09,124
Yes.

1462
02:37:19,625 --> 02:37:22,207
You've made my Kiran weep a lot-

1463
02:37:22,708 --> 02:37:26,999
You've made my Kiran suffer so much-

1464
02:37:30,208 --> 02:37:33,957
You've made her weep a lot.

1465
02:37:49,750 --> 02:37:52,540
That's enough.

1466
02:37:52,875 --> 02:37:56,499
Don't hit me anymore.

1467
02:37:59,416 --> 02:38:01,999
I know that I'm a bad man-

1468
02:38:03,083 --> 02:38:06,374
I've harassed you
and your innocent wife.

1469
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,082
I have harassed her a lot-
Please forgive me.

1470
02:38:11,083 --> 02:38:15,165
But what could I do? I was helpless.

1471
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,124
You're a very nice man.

1472
02:38:20,375 --> 02:38:24,290
How can you kill
someone who is already dead?

1473
02:38:25,666 --> 02:38:27,332
I've received several wounds.

1474
02:38:29,125 --> 02:38:32,874
Forgive me. Pardon me Sunil.

1475
02:38:32,958 --> 02:38:34,499
Please forgive me.

1476
02:38:54,625 --> 02:38:56,457
Please pardon me.

1477
02:38:59,166 --> 02:39:03,374
Your biggest problem is that
you're a nice human being-

1478
02:39:06,833 --> 02:39:07,915
No!

1479
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:15,040
Nobody can come between
Kiran and me.

1480
02:39:17,625 --> 02:39:18,874
You will remember won't you?

1481
02:39:22,375 --> 02:39:24,207
The manly thing!

1482
02:39:25,541 --> 02:39:27,207
The husband is..

1483
02:40:04,708 --> 02:40:06,374
You here?

1484
02:40:07,416 --> 02:40:09,415
How did you get wounded?

1485
02:40:11,291 --> 02:40:12,665
The wounds are very old.

1486
02:40:14,458 --> 02:40:17,915
Earlier they were on the heart.
Now they have come out into the open.

1487
02:40:20,750 --> 02:40:21,957
Where's Sunil?

1488
02:40:24,291 --> 02:40:26,790
He cannot come now.
- Why can't he come?

1489
02:40:30,083 --> 02:40:33,415
He is dead.
- What nonsense? Have you gone mad?

1490
02:40:36,125 --> 02:40:37,249
I'm mad since years-

1491
02:40:40,166 --> 02:40:45,082
You're my madness-
You're my obsession.

1492
02:40:55,291 --> 02:41:16,415
No!

1493
02:41:19,875 --> 02:41:21,249
You're looking so beautiful.

1494
02:41:23,791 --> 02:41:28,874
Just like you were on
the first day to college..

1495
02:41:29,291 --> 02:41:30,457
-a little scared..

1496
02:41:30,791 --> 02:41:32,665
-a little coy-

1497
02:41:33,458 --> 02:41:36,832
-you were wearing the
yellow salwar-kameez..

1498
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:38,582
Books in one hand..

1499
02:41:39,041 --> 02:41:41,999
-and silver bangles
on your other arm..

1500
02:41:51,083 --> 02:41:53,165
You looked just like this-

1501
02:41:53,458 --> 02:41:56,832
The hair curled just like this..

1502
02:41:58,583 --> 02:42:01,540
Don't be scared of me.
Don't run away from me.

1503
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,957
I've come to tell you that
you're no longer in danger-

1504
02:42:07,958 --> 02:42:11,415
You're free.. absolutely free-

1505
02:42:13,083 --> 02:42:19,207
The one who misled you troubled you
the one who held you captive..

1506
02:42:20,083 --> 02:42:22,499
He is dead.
- No! No!

1507
02:42:22,583 --> 02:42:26,999
Sunil cannot die! You're lying!
Sunil cannot die!

1508
02:42:28,541 --> 02:42:32,249
I've killed him!

1509
02:42:33,166 --> 02:42:35,124
Do you know how many
have died because of you?

1510
02:42:35,541 --> 02:42:39,207
First those policemen
then my friend Vicky and now Sunil!

1511
02:42:44,250 --> 02:42:45,624
He was a very nice human being-

1512
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:50,124
Look-don't be insistent.

1513
02:42:53,333 --> 02:42:57,457
If you don't want more
people to die then do as I say.

1514
02:42:59,666 --> 02:43:00,832
But Sunil..?

1515
02:43:02,125 --> 02:43:04,999
Sunil is dead. I've killed him-

1516
02:43:12,375 --> 02:43:14,999
Please pardon me.

1517
02:43:15,666 --> 02:43:22,207
Don't weep.. don't weep.
I cannot see your tears.

1518
02:43:26,541 --> 02:43:30,165
Don't weep.
- I beg of you-

1519
02:43:31,083 --> 02:43:32,999
Please leave me.

1520
02:43:34,958 --> 02:43:36,999
I'm prepared to offer
you anything else but this.

1521
02:43:37,541 --> 02:43:42,540
I can even offer you my life-
But don't say this.

1522
02:43:43,083 --> 02:43:45,540
I've done so many
things to possess you.

1523
02:43:46,125 --> 02:43:48,374
I've changed even
the lines of destiny.

1524
02:43:48,833 --> 02:43:53,707
I'm made the impossible possible.
I've done so much for you. And you..

1525
02:43:55,250 --> 02:43:59,832
Why don't you understand?

1526
02:44:02,541 --> 02:44:04,082
Come on-come on.. get up!

1527
02:44:04,833 --> 02:44:07,707
Hurry up Kiran. It is too late.

1528
02:44:08,250 --> 02:44:10,124
Now get ready quickly-

1529
02:44:10,625 --> 02:44:14,165
Wear this saree.

1530
02:44:16,208 --> 02:44:20,290
It is my mother's saree.
She wore it on her wedding.

1531
02:44:21,250 --> 02:44:24,499
Now her daughter-in-law
will wear it-

1532
02:44:25,708 --> 02:44:26,832
Take it.

1533
02:44:27,291 --> 02:44:28,374
Hold it!

1534
02:44:28,583 --> 02:44:31,082
Come on!

1535
02:44:33,291 --> 02:44:34,499
Be careful!

1536
02:44:36,375 --> 02:44:39,415
You- you will look
very beautiful in this.

1537
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,165
Come on-go!

1538
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,082
Mother.. how are you?

1539
02:45:04,666 --> 02:45:08,249
I had promised you that I'll
make Kiran your daughter-in-law-

1540
02:45:10,416 --> 02:45:11,957
I'm fulfilling my promise today-

1541
02:45:13,500 --> 02:45:16,082
We're coming to you
after the marriage.

1542
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,207
To seek your blessings.

1543
02:46:16,250 --> 02:46:25,582
Open the door-

1544
02:46:39,958 --> 02:46:41,165
Why did she shut the door?

1545
02:46:45,875 --> 02:46:47,165
What's the meaning of
taking away the key?

1546
02:46:48,125 --> 02:46:49,582
She must be feeling shy.

1547
02:47:09,083 --> 02:47:10,374
She must be scared of me-

1548
02:47:11,666 --> 02:47:13,249
She doesn't realise
how much I love her.

1549
02:47:15,083 --> 02:47:16,290
How silly of her!

1550
02:47:16,666 --> 02:47:18,749
She will come. She will come.

1551
02:47:22,416 --> 02:47:24,457
You are my Kiran.

1552
02:47:25,958 --> 02:47:29,249
Kiran! Come on!

1553
02:47:30,375 --> 02:47:35,165
You are my Kiran.

1554
02:48:10,958 --> 02:48:24,374
Come out!

1555
02:48:28,333 --> 02:48:30,915
Come out- The auspicious time
for marriage is passing away.

1556
02:48:37,833 --> 02:48:39,457
No!

1557
02:48:39,541 --> 02:48:42,582
Come on-
- Leave me.

1558
02:48:50,458 --> 02:48:52,624
No! Don't!

1559
02:48:52,958 --> 02:48:55,999
Try to understand.
This marriage is not possible.

1560
02:49:01,333 --> 02:49:03,207
Never say again that this
marriage is not possible.

1561
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,749
This marriage will
surely take place.

1562
02:49:09,125 --> 02:49:10,540
That's the destiny.

1563
02:49:11,958 --> 02:49:13,832
I've written this destiny-

1564
02:49:14,875 --> 02:49:17,290
-that you will be married to me-

1565
02:49:18,541 --> 02:49:21,540
But what's the hurry?

1566
02:49:24,333 --> 02:49:26,499
We can get married
when we get back to India.

1567
02:49:27,833 --> 02:49:32,790
Your family members will be there.
My family members will be there too.

1568
02:49:33,666 --> 02:49:36,749
There will be lot of fanfare.
You'll bring the marriage procession.

1569
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:39,832
There will be rituals..
- No!

1570
02:49:40,166 --> 02:49:42,207
The marriage will take
place right now.. here itself.

1571
02:49:42,375 --> 02:49:44,165
Right now.
- All right.

1572
02:49:44,833 --> 02:49:49,874
As you wish..
but let the storm calm down-

1573
02:49:51,041 --> 02:49:52,874
We will get married thereafter.

1574
02:49:54,208 --> 02:49:59,665
Let this storm see how
lovers like us are united-

1575
02:50:02,625 --> 02:50:04,915
Such a climate such a time
such a place..

1576
02:50:07,458 --> 02:50:09,624
Nobody must have got
married in such a way.

1577
02:50:13,625 --> 02:50:17,290
Get ready quickly.
My mother cannot wait for too long.

1578
02:50:18,458 --> 02:50:20,290
Mother? Mother!

1579
02:50:21,125 --> 02:50:23,082
Mother! Mother!

1580
02:50:24,208 --> 02:50:27,665
Mother! We are coming!

1581
02:50:29,083 --> 02:50:30,874
Come on Kiran.
Wear the saree quickly.

1582
02:50:30,958 --> 02:50:33,874
No..
- Come on..

1583
02:50:45,416 --> 02:50:46,499
Don't come forward.

1584
02:50:48,625 --> 02:50:51,124
Don't come forward.. beware!

1585
02:51:05,083 --> 02:51:06,290
Don't come forward!

1586
02:51:07,041 --> 02:51:09,165
No! No!

1587
02:53:11,750 --> 02:53:14,040
Kill him! Kill him!

1588
02:55:15,958 --> 02:55:19,249
My life began with your love-

1589
02:55:21,541 --> 02:55:23,707
-and ended with your love.

1590
02:55:25,750 --> 02:55:30,707
I know that I've done wrong to you.

1591
02:55:33,125 --> 02:55:34,207
But-

1592
02:55:35,666 --> 02:55:39,874
But don't hate me-

1593
02:55:58,041 --> 02:56:01,790
"Your eyes are sheer magic"

1594
02:56:03,291 --> 02:56:07,415
"Your scent is enchanting"

1595
02:56:08,750 --> 02:56:13,207
"Acquiesce or turn me down.."

1596
02:56:14,041 --> 02:56:18,874
"Acquiesce or turn me down
you do belong to me Kiran-"

1597
02:56:19,333 --> 02:56:22,457
"you're mine Kiran"

1598
02:56:27,625 --> 02:56:29,790
Hello Brother.
- How are both of you?

1599
02:56:30,291 --> 02:56:31,374
Sister-in-law!

1600
02:56:32,333 --> 02:56:34,665
Now I'm feeling scared.
- Why? What happened?

1601
02:56:34,750 --> 02:56:37,249
When Vicky died we had become happy.
But then came Rahul-

1602
02:56:37,375 --> 02:56:39,499
Now we're happy following Rahul's
death. But what if we receive-

1603
02:56:39,583 --> 02:56:41,290
-a phone call at home?
- Whose phone?

1604
02:56:44,290 --> 02:56:48,290
