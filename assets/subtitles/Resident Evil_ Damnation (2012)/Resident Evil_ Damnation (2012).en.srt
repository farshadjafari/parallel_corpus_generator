1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,198
<i>For 74 years, the might
of Soviet socialism was so great</i>

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,669
<i>it split the world
along Eastern and Western lines.</i>

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:32,606
<i>Then, in 1991,
it collapsed completely.</i>

4
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:36,746
<i>One by one, the various countries
which had supported the Soviet Union</i>

5
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,314
<i>began splitting away,</i>

6
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,347
<i>declaring their independence.</i>

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,948
<i>The parliament
of the Eastern Slav Republic</i>

8
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,579
<i>followed suit, declaring
the country a sovereign state,</i>

9
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,728
<i>independent from Soviet rule.</i>

10
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,060
<i>Capitalism advanced rapidly.</i>

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,222
<i>The conglomerates gained influence
in political circles,</i>

12
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:58,334
<i>and as a result,
the oligarchs came into power.</i>

13
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,298
<i>In the Eastern Slav Republic,</i>

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,304
the divide between rich and <i>poor</i>
became so great

15
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,466
<i>it ignited the fuse of a new rebellion.</i>

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,403
<i>The push for independence</i>

17
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,207
<i>exploded into the streets.</i>

18
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,977
<i>Armed freedom fighters pitted
themselves against their government,</i>

19
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,748
<i>now controlled by the oligarchs.</i>

20
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,287
<i>The military prospered
during this time,</i>

21
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,054
<i>becoming ever stronger
and better equipped.</i>

22
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,424
<i>Under the guidance
of Ivan Judanovich,</i>

23
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,760
<i>an Ataman
from the Council of Elders,</i>

24
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,959
<i>the freedom fighters
moved their base</i>

25
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>to a hidden location.</i>

26
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,472
<i>A more suitable place to launch</i>

27
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,075
<i>their guerrilla war
against the government.</i>

28
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,337
<i>After several years of brutal fighting,</i>

29
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,448
<i>it was Svetlana Belikova,</i>

30
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,914
<i>Eastern Slav's first female president,</i>

31
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,247
<i>who offered a ceasefire
to the freedom fighters.</i>

32
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,448
<i>But the break from hostilities
was short-lived.</i>

33
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,459
<i>In November of 2010,
the government discovered</i>

34
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,462
<i>that the rebels' land
contained valuable resources.</i>

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,658
<i>The military continued
their attacks,</i>

36
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,302
<i>claiming they were
fighting terrorism.</i>

37
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:09,534
<i>Losing one base after another
to the military's onslaught,</i>

38
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:12,336
<i>the freedom fighters
escalated their efforts</i>

39
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:15,275
<i>and became more and more
radical in their tactics.</i>

40
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,311
<i>It was then that strange rumors</i>

41
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,110
<i>began spreading like wildfire
among the people</i>

42
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,681
<i>that monsters had joined the battle.</i>

43
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,787
<i>In February of 2011,</i>

44
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,687
<i>the rumors made it to
the old city of Holifgrad,</i>

45
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,728
<i>just a few kilometers
from the Presidential Palace,</i>

46
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,865
<i>an important strategic location
for the government.</i>

47
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,211
Listen to the <i>words</i> of the elders.

48
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,545
<i>We have finally gained
the power that we need.</i>

49
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,554
<i>Power that will lead us to victory.</i>

50
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,556
<i>Gather, people.</i>

51
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,698
<i>Gather and fight.</i>

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,695
Fight for independence!

53
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,280
Retreat! We're getting slaughtered!

54
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,215
Another rebel!

55
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,049
<i>Do not resist arrest.</i>

56
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,192
<i>- Retreat!
- Drop your weapons.</i>

57
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,724
Surrender immediately.
- Government pigs!

58
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,420
<i>I repeat, do not resist arrest.</i>

59
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,621
<i>Surrender immediately.</i>

60
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,217
Moving into position.

61
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:06,413
<i>COPY-</i>

62
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,323
I've got a clear view
of you from the sky.

63
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:13,888
Great.

64
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,694
Maybe you can help me find
a clear route to the CIA drop-off.

65
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,305
Looks like they're doing some
serious renovations down here.

66
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,278
<i>Listen to me carefully, Leon.</i>

67
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,314
<i>Your mission has been aborted.</i>

68
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,249
<i>The U. S. is going to pull out
of the country.</i>

69
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,446
What? I just got here.

70
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,851
After taking me off furlough
and sending me to this

71
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,321
godforsaken place?

72
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,824
What the hell?

73
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,932
<i>Washington and the government there
have decided to go their separate ways.</i>

74
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,466
<i>Everyone has to leave,
not just embassy staff</i>

75
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,435
<i>All American citizens have been
ordered to evacuate the country.</i>

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,504
I don't give a damn
about the politics.

77
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,973
We've got confirmation that B.O.W.s
are being used in this war.

78
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,634
If we don't stop them now,

79
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,940
the same shit will
happen everywhere.

80
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,879
Do you really wanna see that?

81
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,518
This is a war
and things are different.

82
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,019
No one can do anything without backup
from the American government.

83
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,213
Not even you.

84
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,156
Well then, I guess
my only option is to

85
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,728
lose my American
citizenship for a while.

86
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:19,886
<i>Leon!</i>

87
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,163
She can tell them I got lost
and missed my flight.

88
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,903
Better hurry up and get this done.

89
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,870
I need some breakfast.

90
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,394
Scarecrow.

91
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,329
I'm the Tin Man.
Can you talk?

92
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,404
What's the connection between the
anti-government forces and the B.O.W.s?

93
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,411
I guess scarecrows
aren't known

94
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,137
for rousing
conversation.

95
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,404
Hang in there.

96
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,981
I'll get you out of here.

97
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,584
Bee--

98
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,252
What?

99
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,848
Say that again.

100
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:28,786
Bee

101
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,624
keeper.

102
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,353
Beekeeper?

103
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,995
The honeybee I saw outside.

104
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,348
Great. Now I got a
cowardly lion to deal with.

105
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,919
It's the army.

106
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,821
Is anyone here?

107
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,626
Check the room down there.

108
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,836
Hey-- Unh!

109
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,703
Don't say a word.

110
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,313
How about that one?
Shh.

111
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:43,846
Huh?

112
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,721
This one's clear.

113
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,991
Clear.

114
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,634
- This one's clear.
- We're moving on.

115
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,066
Pull out.

116
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,697
They're gone.

117
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,740
We better stay here
a while longer.

118
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,514
They may come back.

119
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,222
Do you think our hostage

120
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,586
will be of any use?

121
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,756
Do you know who we are?

122
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,565
Are you Dorothy?

123
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:34,330
You people in the CIA
call us terrorists.

124
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,334
But we prefer to call ourselves

125
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,902
pro-independence fighters.

126
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,770
What is the CIA
doing here?

127
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,375
Did you put the
government up to this?

128
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:47,950
Are there any more
of you?

129
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,552
I'm not a CIA agent.

130
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,780
I'm just an American who was
screwed out of his vacation,

131
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,084
dumped on a plane
and brought here.

132
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,249
Without breakfast.

133
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,092
They came for you
while you were on vacation?

134
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,287
Hey, Buddy.

135
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,229
He's got to be high up
in the CIA for them to do that.

136
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,125
You watch too many movies.

137
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,769
Then what are you?

138
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,905
Is it common for people in America

139
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,599
to be packing one of these
while on vacation?

140
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,136
Sure. We've been doing it since
the country was founded.

141
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,803
Wow, America's the bomb, yo!

142
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:19,511
Eh.

143
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,144
Whatever.

144
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,217
But even if you're not CIA,

145
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,083
there is no doubt you
must be pretty special

146
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,658
for America to send you here.

147
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:31,655
You were able to take on
that thing, after all.

148
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,162
If you don't stop messing around
with that thing,

149
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,061
you're gonna get us all killed.

150
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,828
There is no doubt about the fact
that you are our enemy.

151
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,144
<i>An anti-terrorist
sweep is now in operation.</i>

152
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,515
<i>Civilians should avoid</i>

153
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,624
<i>going outside
as much as possible.</i>

154
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,158
<i>If you see any suspicious
people or behavior,</i>

155
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,660
<i>report it to the authorities
immediately.</i>

156
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,658
Hm.

157
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,635
Status.

158
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,039
Some escaped underground.

159
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,610
But it's only a matter of time
before they are rounded up.

160
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,144
Tell me in more detail.

161
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,941
When, exactly?

162
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,811
Well...

163
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,346
Um...

164
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,376
You see--

165
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,717
How many times are you going
to make the same mistake?

166
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,994
We should have become a member
of the United Nations five years ago.

167
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,662
And by now
be a respected member

168
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,897
of the international community
in our role as an EU nation.

169
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,904
But before that could happen,

170
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,135
another group came crawling
out of the sewers,

171
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,748
screaming their declarations
of separatism.

172
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,748
And the main cause of this

173
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:05,879
is because you allowed
the terrorists to do as they please.

174
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,822
If we don't act soon,

175
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,658
we will lose our chance
for true independence forever.

176
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,192
And we cannot
allow that to happen

177
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,701
at any cost.

178
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,198
Madam President.

179
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,777
Your visitor has arrived.

180
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,072
Show her in.

181
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,586
Welcome to Eastern Slav,
my dear.

182
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,124
I am President Svetlana Belikova.

183
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,126
Gentlemen, allow me to
introduce you to our guest.

184
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:48,924
This young lady
is a special investigator

185
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,933
for the United Nations'
Bio-terrorism Security Alliance.

186
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,769
Good day, Madam President.

187
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:56,962
Gentlemen.

188
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,871
I have been sent here by the BSAA.

189
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,808
My name is Ada Wong.

190
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,460
Hey, you.

191
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,765
My name is not,
"Hey, you."

192
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,798
I'm JD.

193
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,933
Although that's not
my real name.

194
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,104
The old man's
not looking too good.

195
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,966
He always looks like that.

196
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,101
Let's hope you're right.

197
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,982
Anyways, what are you
really doing in this country?

198
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,316
Hey, a different question
for a change.

199
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,649
Ugh. What I mean is,

200
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,158
being in America
is a lot more fun than

201
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,453
being here, right?

202
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:52,856
I wouldn't know.

203
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,463
The hamburgers, man.

204
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
The fried chicken.

205
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,528
Food in your country's
fantastic.

206
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,429
I could eat it every day.

207
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,667
Thanks for the valuable insight.

208
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,534
And the Hollywood movies.

209
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,173
I love those things.

210
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,105
I have 50 DVDs.

211
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:08,643
None of them are pirated.

212
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,212
I thought you guys hated America.

213
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,871
Sure, we hate it.

214
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,446
But things made in America?

215
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,110
Now, that's different.

216
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,529
Whatever you do,

217
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,198
don't push that button.

218
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,230
I'm not falling for that.

219
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,565
No way I'll allow them
to trace the call.

220
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,213
How are things
out there?

221
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,408
Looks like they have the old pan
of the city surrounded.

222
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,985
We'd better wait and see
how things pan out.

223
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,423
<i>Bio Organic Weapons.</i>

224
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,183
<i>Also known as</i>

225
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,986
B.O.W.s.

226
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,188
Most developed countries
and the United Nations

227
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,892
are against the use and
manufacture of B.O.W.s.

228
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,401
However, they are, unfortunately,

229
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,165
still traded on the
world's black markets.

230
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,601
From a quick glance at this report,

231
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,176
I'd say that using these weapons
in a real conflict

232
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,611
would be extremely
impractical, no?

233
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,779
There's no way to differentiate

234
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,920
between friend and foe.

235
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,055
It is true that total control

236
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,281
of most of the B.O.W.s

237
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:30,119
has been nearly impossible
up until now.

238
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:34,290
But a new technology
that changes that fact

239
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:36,932
has recently been developed.

240
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,364
Tell me more.

241
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,296
Recent technological advancements

242
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,307
can establish
a master/slave relationship

243
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:49,537
between a human and the B.O.W.s.

244
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,807
So? What do they do,
crack whips at it?

245
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,747
Like they do with wild animals?

246
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,778
Not exactly.

247
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,884
Organisms, designed to determine

248
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:06,326
whether a host is to be
a controller or a controlee

249
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,590
take up residence
within the host's body

250
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,669
and creates the perfect
master/slave relationship

251
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,601
between a human
and the B.O.W.

252
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,098
Similar to the relationship

253
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,867
a queen bee shares
with her worker bees.

254
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,288
Yo, bro. Can I speak
to you for a moment?

255
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,758
What about?

256
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,760
It's about Ataman.

257
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,025
It could be dangerous
to move him now.

258
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,829
And your American friend has
also taken quite an interest in him.

259
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:50,701
You don't--

260
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:55,042
You don't have to worry
about me.

261
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,845
We can't stay here forever.

262
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,054
Who's in there?
Open the door.

263
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,682
- Anyone there?
- Open the door.

264
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,726
Open up!
- Stop resisting

265
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,295
and come out.
- Step back.

266
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,827
Three, two,

267
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,593
One!

268
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,666
Don't move. Hands in the air.
Don't move.

269
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,672
Stay still.
Don't shoot.

270
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,310
Drop your guns!

271
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,676
Let's go. Take them away.

272
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,220
Keep away

273
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:48,830
from him!

274
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,166
He's turned!

275
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,530
Downstairs.

276
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,134
Someone is in the basement.

277
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,930
Shoot. Shoot!

278
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,903
Quick, run!

279
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,135
Are you all right?

280
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,601
Ataman.

281
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,641
We have to hurry.

282
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,244
They'll be here soon.

283
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,673
You...

284
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,749
go on ahead.

285
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,477
Damn, just when things
were going well.

286
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,853
We can win this war,

287
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,285
can't we?

288
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,755
JD.

289
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,087
It's-- It's time

290
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,162
for me to go.

291
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,460
But I'll be rooting for you

292
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,192
from heaven.

293
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:39,165
Ugh. Get up, you idiot. You think that
vest you're wearing is a girl's blouse?

294
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,137
We have to get Ataman
away from here.

295
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,642
Huh?

296
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,840
Wow. I should have guessed.

297
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,111
Made in America.

298
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,844
Wait.

299
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,489
Where's the American?

300
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,089
Dead, probably.

301
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,458
Give me a hand.

302
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,964
Leave me here.

303
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:07,134
If we go on like this,

304
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,037
we'll all be killed

305
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,175
before we can launch an attack

306
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,003
on the capital.

307
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,740
Go.

308
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:25,010
Create a new future.

309
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,137
This way. I heard gunshots.

310
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,299
They're here.

311
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm going to go
and check on Marco.

312
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,744
You head to the church
and join the others.

313
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,618
Okay.

314
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,712
Shh.

315
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,146
Hm?

316
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,092
Do you really think
I'm gonna fall for that?

317
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:23,597
Aah!

318
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,501
Kill you.
Do I look like I need a pruning?

319
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:34,933
Don't kill him!

320
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,942
That's one request I can't grant.

321
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,105
Ugh!

322
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,250
Mr. Chenkov.

323
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,743
I told you

324
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,048
not to kill him.

325
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,247
He was my teacher.
It was him or me.

326
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:50,221
And don't forget,

327
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,362
he wasn't your teacher anymore.

328
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,056
Ugh!

329
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,605
Shoot.

330
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,049
Shoot, JD!

331
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:13,204
Why the hell carry that gun around
if you're not gonna use it?

332
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,807
Don't worry.

333
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,811
I'll use it next time.

334
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:39,026
If you ever decide to shoot those things,
shoot them in the head, got it?

335
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:41,494
Wait.

336
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,166
This way.

337
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,532
Two grown men
should be able to open it.

338
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,272
So, what is this place?

339
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,501
Old partisans used to
hole up here

340
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,770
back in the day.

341
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,243
They sure knew how
to keep the enemy out.

342
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,547
This thing ain't gonna budge.

343
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,782
Stand back.

344
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,486
That way.

345
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,996
This way.

346
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,415
Quick.

347
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:27,440
Oh, I knew I should have

348
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:28,906
stayed off the

349
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,443
junk food.

350
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:36,650
Hurry LIP

351
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,817


352
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,822
Get away!

353
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,489
Get him.
Stay away from me!

354
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,621
Get him.

355
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:57,189
No.

356
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,901
- No. No!
- Get him.

357
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,694
Aah!

358
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,535
Please, somebody help me!
Help me!

359
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:07,799
What's happening?

360
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,270
Stay away! No!

361
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,782
Get away!

362
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,180
Help!

363
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,451
What happened to everybody?

364
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,087
Anywhere we can hide?

365
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,990


366
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,260
Yeah.

367
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,540
What did you do
to everybody?

368
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,904
The Plaga you were
hiding got loose.

369
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,980
I don't know what
you're talking about!

370
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,242
Your precious townsfolk are
being controlled by a parasite.

371
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,083
It attaches itself to the central
nervous system via the spinal cord.

372
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,982
The people of the town are--?

373
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,182
They'll never be normal again.

374
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,194
There must be something we can do.
Rip out the spinal cord,

375
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,357
but the best you could hope for
is paralysis or death.

376
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,525
You are lying!

377
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,194
If you really believe that,
then why did you kill the old man?

378
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,869
But that was--

379
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:55,671
Because you knew he would
never be human again.

380
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,612
What he says is true.

381
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,846
I have some more
questions for you.

382
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,465
Maybe this time
we can get to the truth.

383
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,751
What are we going to do?

384
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,322
I have to go and get it.
Go and get it?

385
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:45,552
Why?

386
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:48,630
We need somebody
to take over for Ataman.

387
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,400
You've seen what's
happening outside.

388
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,467
Do you want that to happen to you?

389
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,407
What we do today will carry
the country into tomorrow.

390
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,907
But even so...

391
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,780
I'll meet up with the others
tomorrow to plan

392
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,976
an attack on the
Presidential Palace.

393
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,753
Get ready for that.

394
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,960
I'll be back soon.

395
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,056
I want a word with him.

396
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,835
He's gone to get it.
The Plaga?

397
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,568
I don't know its name.

398
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:13,510
All I know is that it was
given to us by the elders.

399
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,885
You inject that stuff into your body
to control the Lickers, right?

400
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,192
Some compassionate elders
you got there.

401
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,164
What other options do we have?

402
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:34,769
Do you realize
that the whole world ignores us?

403
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,961
That we are in danger
of extermination?

404
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,235
Save your breath.

405
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:42,105
We're not gonna see
eye to eye on this.

406
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,206
Help us.

407
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,608
I don't want to see him
change into a monster.

408
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,047
Irina would not be happy
about this.

409
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,492
Irina?

410
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,226
We knew her
since we were kids.

411
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,228
Buddy's fiancée.

412
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,065
She was a school teacher
and, believe it or not,

413
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,364
so was Buddy.

414
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,869
Bastards thought
their school

415
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,601
was a pro-independence
hideout and attacked it.

416
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,206
Irina and the kids died in the attack.

417
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,728
<i>That's the reason why
he's fighting this war.</i>

418
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,139
<i>He had never even held
a gun up until then.</i>

419
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,094
I'm going to pretend you escaped.

420
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:19,266
In return, you must get
ahold of it before he does.

421
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,172
So now you trust me?

422
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,273
I don't know who or what you are,

423
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,884
but I do know that
you saved my life.

424
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,387
You must stop Sasha.

425
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,498
You'll find him
in the central marketplace.

426
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,875
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

427
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,739
The operation begins at 2000 hours.

428
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,436
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

429
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:17,550
Looking for someone?

430
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,592
Ada.

431
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,110
It's been a long time, Leon.

432
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,217
What are you doing here?

433
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,956
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

434
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,250
Did you release
the Plaga?

435
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,322
Don't make me laugh.

436
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,228
I'm not interested
in defective products.

437
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,090
I'm just here to lend them
a hand.

438
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,965
Them?

439
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,168
Although it seems as if
my help wasn't needed.

440
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,340
What are you doing here?

441
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,208
If they attack the capital,

442
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,503
it'll make my job a lot easier.

443
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,041
That's all.

444
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,744
By the way,

445
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:17,547
when are we going to, um, carry on

446
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,778
from where we left off that night?

447
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,150
Heh. Any time but now.

448
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:26,954
You're angry with me, aren't you?

449
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,260
Suits you.

450
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,402
Quick word of warning.

451
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,768
This town will be purged soon!

452
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,842
Women.

453
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,594
General?

454
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,090
Yes.

455
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,568
You may start the attack
when you are ready.

456
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:09,068
Thank you.

457
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:16,072
Bring Ada Wong to me.
She should see this.

458
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,547
Great. I get to play Santa Claus.

459
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,195
Are you all right?

460
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:52,141
Yeah, just let my guard
down for a moment.

461
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,777
They got us pretty good.

462
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:16,487
Where's Buddy?
He already left by the time I got there.

463
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:18,827
Damn!
We have to leave now.

464
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,300
The military's gonna
burn the whole area

465
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,960
and everything in it.

466
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,471
What?
We're out of time

467
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,538
What's wrong?

468
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,079
Nothing.

469
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:38,311
There's just something
I have to do.

470
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,043
Won't you be needing that?

471
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:11,344
Hm.

472
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,347
Hm.

473
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,065
Ah, you my man. Heh, heh.

474
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,692
Buddy.

475
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:33,565
Cool. You're still human.

476
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,237
JD.

477
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,039
You. What have you done?

478
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:42,543
No. He's not our enemy. He's--

479
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,815
I'm fine. Just go.

480
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,648
I don't want to cause
any more trouble.

481
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,563
It's time to say goodbye.

482
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,641
JD!

483
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,304
Wait.

484
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:32,463
You know, I didn't really care
about independence.

485
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:38,364
All I wanted was to have fun
with you and my friends.

486
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:39,871
And...

487
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,666
I was looking forward
to showing you America.

488
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,371
Trust me,

489
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,608
I've seen this
happen every time.

490
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,327
When you're dealing with B.O.W.s,

491
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,193
there's no difference
between friend or enemy.

492
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,695
It takes everything from you:

493
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,931
The cause you're fighting for,
the respect you have for others.

494
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,233
We have to keep this from
ever happening again.

495
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,378
Give me the Plaga.

496
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:59,081
As far as I am concerned,

497
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:04,514
there is no difference between
this and using B.O.W.s.

498
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,733
If you want to keep this
from happening again,

499
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,032
put down your gun.

500
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,873
Well, then.

501
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,405
That is my answer...

502
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,543
and your answer.

503
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,976
The eradication of the B.O.W.s
is moving ahead according to plan.

504
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:01,074
You mustn't allow even one of them
to escape the city.

505
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,309
We are prepared for all
eventualities, madam.

506
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,456
And one more thing,
regarding Ada Wong.

507
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,514
Did you find anything out?

508
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:13,423
There is no one working for the BSAA
by the name of Ada Wong.

509
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,195
Are you serious?

510
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,027
Yes, madam.

511
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,097
Hm.

512
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,994
Of course.

513
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:41,884
Central gate.

514
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,217
<i>Report your status.</i>

515
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,858
Central gate reporting.

516
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:46,722
All is calm.
- Roger.

517
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:48,864
Keep your eyes peeled.

518
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,161
<i>Three trucks are approaching.</i>

519
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,065
<i>Heads up, everyone.</i>

520
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:08,213
Halt.

521
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:09,407
Halt!

522
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,425
Where did you go last night?

523
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,358
You were not in the hotel.

524
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:58,693
I went to meet an old friend.

525
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,059
And this old friend...

526
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,239
is he a spy?

527
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:08,932
Hm.

528
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,376
Who are you working for?
The Russians?

529
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,311
The Americans?

530
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,918
I'll leave that
to your imagination.

531
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,916
Considering that you will never be
leaving this country again,

532
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:24,958
I would say it is in your best interests
to stay on my good side.

533
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,496
Very funny.

534
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:27,956
So it's true what they said
about you being a former instructor.

535
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,313
Hm.

536
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,688
Former? I still am an instructor.

537
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,034
Yes?

538
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:24,146
The terrorists broke through the
central gate.

539
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,954
As I said, we have decided
to delay your departure.

540
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:36,614
Permanently.

541
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:52,438
Now, that's impressive.

542
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,625
I keep saying

543
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,737
these things make bad pets.

544
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:35,510
<i>We are under attack by terrorists.
We need reinforcements, now!</i>

545
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,653
<i>We can't defend
the palace much longer. Aah!</i>

546
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:30,090
Sony, but I don't have time to stay
and chat right now.

547
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,476
Amateurs.

548
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:22,309
They didn't even
give me a pat-down.

549
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,340
I didn't expect to get into
this place so easily.

550
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,818
Pretty impressive for

551
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,389
an old nuclear shelter.

552
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:39,155


553
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:51,201
Heh. So you missed me, huh?

554
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,606
Yeah. In your dreams.

555
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,306
You seeing
what I'm seeing?

556
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,208
Uh-huh.

557
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:03,451
It's like a beehive.

558
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,628
Have you looked inside
one of these?

559
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:22,733
It's the Plaga.

560
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:25,032
Hmm.

561
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,139
Big surprise.

562
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:34,409
Workers have been
cultivated in the past.

563
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,447
But this...

564
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,447
This is the first time that
the dominant members

565
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,387
of the species have been cultured.

566
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,284
What are you doing?

567
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,329
I'm working.
Don't worry about it.

568
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,623
Oh, I'm worried.

569
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:52,266
Enough!

570
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:05,072
So this is what you're here for.

571
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,338
Well?

572
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:07,606
Are you satisfied?

573
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:11,115
Yes, thank you very much.

574
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:13,454
Who is he?

575
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,748
I don't know.

576
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,148
He's an American agent.

577
01:00:17,646 --> 01:00:20,286
Well, now that we got that
out of the way...

578
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,820
An American?

579
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,000
You'd better watch out.

580
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,601
That old broad's got a bite
worse than her bark.

581
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,260
Say what?

582
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,108
Over there! Over there! Shoot!

583
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,842
Ceasefire! Ceasefire! Unh!

584
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,951
Ceasefire!

585
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,130
Don't move.

586
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,675
Do you have any idea

587
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,317
who you are pointing
your gun at?

588
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,650
Hmm. Yeah, let me see.

589
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,844
You're the beekeeper.

590
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,581
The beekeeper?

591
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,351
The person who
released the Plaga.

592
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:30,489
Just as I thought,
you haven't a clue.

593
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:34,362
I am the president
of this country.

594
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,021
So that's what Ada meant.

595
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:58,489
He is an enemy of the state.
Kill him!

596
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:16,099
<i>Creatures broke through</i>

597
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,768
<i>the cargo entrance!
They're heading your way!</i>

598
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,072
<i>Aah!</i>

599
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:52,143
Open fire!

600
01:02:57,773 --> 01:03:00,253
Cease fire. Cease fire.

601
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,288
Help me!

602
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:49,492
SOLDIER 1 I
Aah!

603
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,898
Fall back! Aah!

604
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,851
Did you use it?

605
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,021
Get him.

606
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:52,929


607
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,760
I'm sorry.

608
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,565
I couldn't stop him.

609
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,005
You bastard! Aah!

610
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:45,346
Help!

611
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:35,963
Unh!

612
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:42,409
What will you gain
by killing me?

613
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,809
Have you thought
this through?

614
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,505
Who will lead the country
once you gain independence?

615
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,014
You?

616
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,052
I have no intention
of taking advice

617
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:55,688
from a pretender to the throne.
Heh.

618
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,688
In case you're interested,

619
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,157
all of the elders,
with the exception of Ataman,

620
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,230
have already come over to my side.

621
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:09,230
They all said they would be happy
to renege on independence

622
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:12,235
once I promised to share
the oil profits with them.

623
01:07:12,394 --> 01:07:14,396
That's not possible.

624
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,737
Yes, that's what I thought.

625
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,210
But I'm afraid it's true.

626
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,246
Shut up! Unh!

627
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:30,253
While we have been wasting time here,
things have been happening in the world.

628
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:36,762
We don't have time
to fight amongst ourselves

629
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,764
in this tiny little country.

630
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,900
Shut up!

631
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:05,454
Oh, great. It just keeps getting better.

632
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,940
We have to go.

633
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:37,358
Svetlana!

634
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,965
<i>A biohazard
release has been detected.</i>

635
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,127
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

636
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:57,536
<i>The incineration of the facility
will begin shortly.</i>

637
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,690
Run!

638
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,898
Why is it doing that?

639
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,631
You owe me one.

640
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:56,952
Why are you helping me?

641
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:59,524
Don't get all sentimental
on me.

642
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:02,194
I'm not doing this for you.

643
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,662
There's nobody else left to tell the
world what really happened, that's why.

644
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:19,738
The hatch!

645
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,827
This will take us up.

646
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,569
Damn it.

647
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:49,733
Hurry.

648
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:56,280
Come on.

649
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,605
Let's get going.

650
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:38,154
<i>This is an announcement</i>

651
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:41,082
<i>from the government
of the Eastern Slav Republic.</i>

652
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:41,182


653
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:42,753
We are under attack

654
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:43,920
<i>by terrorists.</i>

655
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,565
<i>Biochemical weapons</i>

656
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,097
<i>may have been used.</i>

657
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,600
<i>You are ordered
to evacuate the city immediately.</i>

658
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,569
<i>Please keep a distance
of five kilometers from the capital.</i>

659
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,274
Excuse me.

660
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,573
Yes, what is it?

661
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,078
Forces have been
evacuated from the city

662
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,810
to escape the B.O.W.s
released by the terrorists.

663
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,011
However,

664
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:11,988
it appears the two in the
shelter have managed to escape.

665
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:16,662
Why are you wasting
my time telling me this?

666
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,765
Just let the you-know-what
get rid of them.

667
01:14:19,921 --> 01:14:21,958
I'll see to it immediately.

668
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,143
Help me!

669
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:08,323
Nice work, pal.

670
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:08,685
Get out of there!

671
01:18:48,189 --> 01:18:50,261
You really
shouldn't have done that.

672
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,868
You really want to fight this out, huh?

673
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:48,886
Sony for butting in.

674
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,533
You can run, but you can't hide.

675
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,143
Ah, come on. Don't be shy.

676
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,087
NOW!

677
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:29,653
This might hurt a little.

678
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:13,663
I didn't expect to be saved

679
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:15,432
by B.O.W.s.

680
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:33,787
Wanna go grab a few beers?

681
01:22:35,516 --> 01:22:37,359
Are you buying?

682
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,832
You'll have to go without me.

683
01:22:56,337 --> 01:22:58,511
Can't they find anybody
else to play with?

684
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,685
Why don't you go without me?

685
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:04,551
I like the company.

686
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:11,122
We'd better move a little faster.

687
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:21,632
<i>Today</i> the capital

688
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:26,404
<i>was subjected to a powerful attack
launched by terrorists.</i>

689
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:29,139
<i>They struck with fearsome weapons</i>

690
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:31,978
<i>of mass destruction
known as B. O.W.s,</i>

691
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,520
<i>which have been banned
internationally.</i>

692
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,155
We as a country desire nothing more

693
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,386
than to live in peace.

694
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:46,189
Together with the elders of the
anti-government movement,

695
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:51,202
who, might I add,
graciously listened to our pleas,

696
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,341
have managed to avert
the most serious crisis

697
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,873
in the history of our nation.

698
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:02,081
I believe this is undeniable proof
that as a country,

699
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:03,681
as a people,

700
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:08,845
we are suitable for full acceptance
into the international community.

701
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:11,250
As leader...

702
01:24:14,615 --> 01:24:16,220
Something wrong?

703
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,190
I don't need this.

704
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:20,265
I'll improvise.

705
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:26,430
What about the elders?

706
01:24:26,595 --> 01:24:30,770
It's over. All of them.
A little while ago.

707
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:36,211
I suppose I should mention that
during the press conference,

708
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:40,810
that the terrorists
executed the elders

709
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,478
as traitors.

710
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:44,386
Yes, madam.

711
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,056
Is there anything else?

712
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:50,090
I've already contacted
the BSAA and Interpol

713
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:53,494
with regard to the damage
we sustained because of Ada Wong.

714
01:24:53,654 --> 01:24:57,501
An international warrant for
her arrest will be issued soon.

715
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:00,573
A few of the terrorists
managed to escape the city,

716
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:02,902
but you don't have to
worry about them.

717
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,011
What about the other two?

718
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:07,673
It's just a matter of time.

719
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:11,842
Finally, there is no one
left to stop us.

720
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,247
That's right,
Madam President.

721
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:17,422
Very well, let's start the
press conference immediately.

722
01:25:17,578 --> 01:25:19,752
Yes, of course,
Madam President.

723
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:29,592
At last,

724
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,636
a new tomorrow begins.

725
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,694
They were keeping an eye
on me the whole time.

726
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:10,202
<i>On air in five, four, three...</i>

727
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,761
Good evening. I am President--

728
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:15,533
Madam President.

729
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:18,474
We're under attack
by the Americans and Russians.

730
01:27:18,632 --> 01:27:21,045
What? It can't be.

731
01:27:49,331 --> 01:27:51,503
Stay down,
you dogs.

732
01:27:51,667 --> 01:27:53,043
Stay still.

733
01:27:53,402 --> 01:27:55,109
Move. Keep them away.

734
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,045
Move! Move!

735
01:27:57,472 --> 01:28:00,180
- Hands in the air!
- Help me.

736
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,572
So...

737
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:24,307
The Americans and Russians
had us in the palms of their hands

738
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,104
from the beginning.

739
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:29,314
That's what it looks like.

740
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:31,880
Did you know about this?

741
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:34,886
No.

742
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:38,787
If I did, I'd still be enjoying
my vacation.

743
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:44,893
He?!

744
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:12,649
I've lost everything.

745
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,524
My mentor,

746
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,426
my friends.

747
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,332
I have nothing left to fight for.

748
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,509
Kill me.

749
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,376
Please.

750
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:43,949
I don't want to change
into one of those monsters.

751
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,875
Well...

752
01:30:07,269 --> 01:30:09,771
I guess there is no other choice.

753
01:30:29,256 --> 01:30:31,828
I'd feel the same way if I was you.

754
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,775
But the option of taking our own
lives no longer belongs to us.

755
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:47,750
Once we start using these, we owe it
to the people who died alongside us.

756
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:50,014
We have to continue living.

757
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:02,029
Even if it means living the rest of our
lives without the use of our limbs.

758
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,042
That is my answer

759
01:31:11,733 --> 01:31:13,609
and your answer...

760
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,012
Buddy.

761
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:33,030
<i>It's been three days
since the end of the civil war</i>

762
01:31:33,188 --> 01:31:35,565
<i>that tore through
the Eastern Slav Republic.</i>

763
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:37,202
<i>The fierce battles</i>

764
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:41,671
<i>were halted thanks to the intervention
of American and Russian troops.</i>

765
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,399
<i>Today marks the first day</i>

766
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:46,408
<i>in which the world's media
has access to the city.</i>

767
01:31:46,568 --> 01:31:49,572
<i>A temporary government
headed by the U. S. and Russia</i>

768
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:53,650
<i>will be set up in the Eastern
Slav Republic to maintain peace.</i>

769
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:57,188
Svetlana Belikova has resigned
from her presidency

770
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,689
<i>and companies that supported her
and the former government</i>

771
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:03,693
<i>will be thrown out of the country
and dismantled.</i>

772
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,197
Top brass knew about it right
from the beginning, didn't they?

773
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:14,936
The report from
Scarecrow tipped them off

774
01:32:15,095 --> 01:32:17,939
that Svetlana was in
possession of B.O.W.s.

775
01:32:18,365 --> 01:32:20,175
That's why they pulled out
in a panic

776
01:32:20,335 --> 01:32:23,247
and ran like hell to join forces
with the Russians.

777
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:26,876
To protect themselves, right?

778
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:28,719
You're mistaken.

779
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,380
The president had nothing
to do with this.

780
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:35,551
Not even we knew what was going on.
You have to believe me.

781
01:32:38,453 --> 01:32:39,796
Leon.

782
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:43,231
I'm not going anywhere
Don't--

783
01:32:47,127 --> 01:32:50,837
In the end, nothing's really changed.

784
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:12,394
<i>Everything went according to plan.</i>

785
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:14,555
<i>The facility has been destroyed</i>

786
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:17,363
<i>and I salvaged
the cultivated Plaga.</i>

787
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,167
<i>But I haven't decided</i>

788
01:33:21,363 --> 01:33:23,809
<i>whether or not
I should send it to you.</i>

789
01:33:28,302 --> 01:33:29,645
<i>Really?</i>

790
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:33,114
<i>Thank you. That's very kind.</i>

791
01:33:33,408 --> 01:33:35,979
<i>Although, I sort of liked the idea</i>

792
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:40,091
<i>of adding an international
arrest warrant to my profile.</i>

793
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:22,962
What are you doing?

794
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:26,996
- You're going to get in trouble.
- Did you do yours?

795
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:33,011
- Morning.
- Hi.

796
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:35,876
Good morning.
- Morning.

797
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:52,659
Oh, come on, let's
go, we're gonna be late.

798
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:57,594
Morning.
