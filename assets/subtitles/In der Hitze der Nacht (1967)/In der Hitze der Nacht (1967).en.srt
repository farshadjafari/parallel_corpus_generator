Where you keepin' the pie tonight?

A man ate the last piece
just before you come in.

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,477
What's that little old orphan
sittin' right up there?

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,676
Marble cake.

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,430
Tell you what, Sam. Bein' she's
in there by her little old lonesome,

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,391
I'll let you have her for free.

32
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,035
I told you 'bout that "Sam" business,
didn't l? Hm?

33
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,119

(doctor) lt's Colbert, all right.
Skull's caved in.

55
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,755
You ever take a homicide
picture before, son?

56
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,189
Well, at least he won't be movin' on me.

57
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,632
That's for sure. I want you to cover every
angle. Do you hear me? Every angle.

58
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,035
uh, you boys, move on back now, OK?

59
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,197
Came all this way to build us a factory,

60
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,955
make somethin' outta this town.

61
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,594
Look what it got him.

62
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,311
Yeah.

63
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,359
Sam, did he have a wallet,
identification, anything like that?

64
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,950
That's the first thing l looked for.
Whoever fixed him musta took 'em.

65
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,832
Nothin'.

66
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,718
- Any witnesses?
- I mean, not even a cat.

67
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,519
- How long's he been dead?
- Oh, less than an hour.

68
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,916
- Less than an hour.
- Maybe half that.

69
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,996
Maybe half.

70
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,075
Could have been a hitchhiker.

71
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,829
Check both ends of town, check
the depot, and check the pool hall. OK?

72
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,270
- Pool hall closed at one o'clock, Chief.
- I said check it, Sam.

73
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,675
Yes, sir.

74
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,395
On your feet, boy.

75
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,434
I mean now!

76
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,920
Get against that wall.
Get them hands high!

77
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,793
Spread them fingers out.
I wanna count all ten.

78
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,595
You move before l tell you to, boy,
by God, l'm gonna clean your plough.

79
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,277
That's pretty fat there, ain't it, boy? Huh?

80
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,198
Now, outside there's a police car.
You're gonna pick up that bag.

81
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,869
You're gonna walk out, and you're
gonna plant yourself in the back.

82
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,197
And you're gonna be
a real nice quiet boy all the way in.

83
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,553
You hear?!

84
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,996
C'mon, boy.

85
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,076
Move it!

86
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,436
Chief here?

87
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,356
- Hey, what's up, Sam?
- (Sam) Chief?

88
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,436
What's goin' on?

89
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,073
- Sam?
- (squeaking)

90
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,316
(clattering)

91
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,756
(quicker clattering)

92
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,309
- Wood?
- Yes, sir?

93
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,558
When's the last time l asked Courtney
to get oil for this damn thing?

94
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,671
uh, last Wednesday.

95
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,552
Would you be kind enough to go outside
and remind him what day it is today?

96
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,069
Well, uh... how about the prisoner here?

97
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,514
Don't you worry about him.

98
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,995
Got a name, boy?

99
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,076
Virgil Tibbs.

100
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,832
Virgil?

101
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,509
Well, l don't think we're gonna
have any trouble, are we, Virgil?

102
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,911
No trouble at all.

103
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,440
Oh, you can go now, Sam.

104
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,516
Yes, sir.

105
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,358
- What did you hit him with?
- Hit whom?

106
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,990
"Whom"? Whom?

107
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,716
You a Northern boy? What's a Northern
boy like you doin' all the way down here?

108
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,152
- I was waiting for the train.
- There ain't no trains this time of mornin'.

109
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,795
- Tuesdays only. 4.05 to Memphis.
- You say.

110
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,953
(train horn in distance)

111
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,594
Well... All right, you say right.

112
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,674
All right... Virgil.

113
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,958
Oh!

114
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,036
Now look.

115
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,517
I try to run a nice, clean, safe town here.

116
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,029
A town where a man can sneeze and not
get his brains beat out. You follow me?

117
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,515
Yes.

118
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,589
Why don't you tell me how you killed
Mr Colbert? You'll feel a whole lot better.

119
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,754
(knocking)

120
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,036
Not now!

121
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,073
I was visiting my mother.

122
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,272
I came in on the 1 2.35 from Brownsville.

123
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,518
I was waiting to go out on the 4.05.

124
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,672
Mm-hm.

125
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,790
Yeah.

126
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,630
And meanwhile, you killed yourself
a white man and picked yourself up $200!

127
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,479
I earned that money,
ten hours a day, seven days a week.

128
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,993
Coloured can't earn that. It's more than l
make in a month! Where did you earn it?!

129
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,111
- Philadelphia.
- Mississippi?

130
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,437
- Pennsylvania.
- Just how do you earn that kinda money?

131
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,915
I'm a police officer.

132
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,036
(throws badge on desk)

133
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,991
Oh, yeah.

134
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,876
- Wood!
- Yes, sir!

135
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,908
- Did you question this man?
- No, sir.

136
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,233
Would you mind taking a look at that?

137
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,632
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

138
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,148
I'll check on this wise city boy.
You take him outside and hold him.

139
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,759
Yes, sir.

140
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,953
May l suggest that you call my chief
rather than send a wire or anything?

141
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,232
I mean, it would be quicker.
And l'll pay for the call.

142
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,798
Did you hear? Did you hear him
say he'd pay for the call?

143
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,753
How much do they pay you
to do their police work?

144
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,758
$162.39 per week.

145
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,835
(whistles)

146
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,033
$162.39 a week!

147
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,153
Well, boy! Take him outside, Wood.
But treat him easy,

148
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,353
because a man that
makes $162.39 a week -

149
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,755
man, we do not wanna ruffle him!

150
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,876
No, sir!

151
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,555
Courtney... would you try
and get me long-distance?

152
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,436
(Courtney) Police business, honey.
Chief's on the line.

153
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,950
No. He catch you listenin' in,
he'll run your butt around the block.

154
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,514
- He don't panic me none.
- No?

155
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,914
- Where's the chief?
- You got the pictures of the dead man?

156
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,271
Sure do. I got him top,
bottom, sideways - you name it.

157
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,392
- Good. I'll take 'em, son.
- No, l wanna give 'em to the chief.

158
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,796
- I said l'd take 'em, Charlie.
- Do like he tells you, Charlie.

159
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,070
Somebody owes me
some money for those.

160
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,112
I had to buy paper and film
and developin'.

161
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,597
That's all right. Just bill the department.
Everything will be taken care of.

162
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,513
God Almighty. He sure looks bad.

163
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,198
May l see the man
l am supposed to have killed?

164
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,920
Sure. I don't know why not.

165
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,238
(whispers) Hey, Sam. He's finished talkin'.

166
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,833
- Here's the photos of the dead man.
- OK.

167
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,277
Got your chief on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

168
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,794
Hello? Yes, sir. I'm sorry
to have gotten you involved in this.

169
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,275
I really had no choice.

170
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,476
Yes, sir.

171
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,109
You can't be serious, sir. I mean, even
if l could be of help, they wouldn't want it.

172
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,995
No, sir. I'm not prejudiced.

173
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,434
Yes, sir. I am a police officer
and they're police officers, but...

174
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,593
Hello. This is Gillespie.
Yes, sir. Yep, well...

175
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,636
You don't say?

176
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,720
He's your number one homicide expert?

177
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,717
Well, my, my, my.

178
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,957
I don't think we need any help.
We can wrap this up ourselves.

179
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,310
Yes, sir. But l do want to thank you

180
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,797
for offering me such a powerful piece
of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.

181
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,673
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Yeah. Goodbye, now.

182
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,796
Oh, it's all there.
We paid for the phone call ourselves.

183
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,514
Now, you are the number one
homicide expert.

184
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,394
- That's right.
- I bet you look at a lot of dead bodies.

185
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,397
Lots.

186
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,272
Well?

187
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,837
- Well, what?
- Well...

188
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,397
I just thought maybe, uh... Maybe you
wouldn't mind takin' a look at this one?

189
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,991
No, thanks.

190
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,078
- Why not, expert?
- Because l've got a train to catch.

191
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,760
Wait a minute.
That train don't leave till noon.

192
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,237
They pay you $162.39 a week just to look
at bodies. Why can't you look at this one?

193
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,512
- Why can't you look at it for yourself?
- Because l'm not an expert...

194
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,709
Officer!

195
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,199
Ten cents, ten million dollars - just
doesn't matter when a man's time comes.

196
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,117
Mm-hm.

197
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,073
I could give him a nicer service
right here in Sparta

198
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,239
than he could ever get up there
in Chicago. And at half the price, too.

199
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,318
- I got a rosewood casket out there...
- (door opens)

200
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,319
Ted ulam, Chief.
We haven't had the pleasure.

201
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,396
That's for sure.

202
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,396
He's with me.

203
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,636
Hello, Doc.

204
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,272
Yep.

205
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,832
Well...

206
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,072
uh...

207
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,428
Do you wanna look at it?

208
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,955
(Virgil) New manicure. That's good.

209
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,396
That's very good.

210
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,038
- I'll need a few things.
- (Gillespie) Such as?

211
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,597
Ammonium hydrosulphide,
benzidine, superoxide of hydrogen.

212
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,113
Copper powder, distilled water.

213
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,035
A six-inch celluloid scale.

214
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,672
Thermometer.

215
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,236
Some tweezers.

216
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,318
Callipers. And some toothpicks.

217
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,318
Toothpicks?! Copper...?
What's goin' on here, Chief?

218
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,351
Who is this boy anyway?

219
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,790
I asked him to look at the body.
That's who he is.

220
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,195
It's 4.45. What time was this man killed?

221
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,678
Sam found him at 3am. The doctor says
it's possible he was killed an hour earlier.

222
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,633
- At two?
- Maybe a little later.

223
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,274
2.1 5... 2.30?

224
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,834
Would you feel the face and jaw, please?

225
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,954
Am l mistaken, or has rigor begun?

226
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,992
It has.

227
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,197
You'll notice too
that postmortem lividity is present.

228
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,074
So the time of death really has
to be earlier. Wouldn't you say?

229
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,715
Mm.

230
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,469
Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that
as soon as l get a thermometer.

231
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,513
As you know, the loss of heat from
the brain is the most reliable way

232
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,995
of determining time of death.

233
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,439
Right, Chief?

234
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,673
Oh, yeah.

235
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,072
Well...

236
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,713
Which one of you gentlemen
will assist me?

237
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,956
(phone rings)

238
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,114
ulam's Funer... It's for you, Chief.

239
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,512
Yeah. Talk to me.

240
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,392
When?

241
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,237
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I've
got a runaway suspect, boy. I gotta go.

242
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,397
Now listen, you. Anything he wants,
man, you better see that he gets it.

243
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,395
Where can l wash my hands?

244
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,356
(dogs barking in the distance)

245
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,676
(grunt)

246
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,355
(dogs barking with excitement)

247
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,355
This here's Shagbag, you hear?
He's headed for the river.

248
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,113
The river, you hear?
He's gonna be in Arkansas.

249
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,274
Shoot.

250
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,476
(train horn)

251
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,635
OK. I got him.

252
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,396
Mrs Colbert.

253
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,119
- How is she taking it?
- Chief had to leave. She don't know it yet.

254
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,235
Hey! You can't go in there, boy!

255
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,434
- Mrs Colbert?
- Where's my husband?

256
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,514
What's happened to him? Why won't
anybody tell me what's happened to him?

257
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,235
Why won't anybody here tell me?
l have a right to know if he's hurt,

258
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,591
if he's been in an accident.
I want to know if he is all right!

259
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,950
Your husband is dead, Mrs Colbert.

260
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,038
uh...

261
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,116
Somebody killed him.

262
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,875
We don't know who - yet.

263
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,432
It's, uh...

264
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,555
It's very hot in here.

265
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,035
It's very hot in this room.

266
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,672
Sit down.

267
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,232
No.

268
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,756
(sobs)

269
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,592
Would you...

270
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,799
Would you... Ieave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

271
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,796
(sobs)

272
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,636
(sobbing continues)

273
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,679
Virgil, we don't need you or your
microscopes. Tell that to your chief.

274
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,155
We don't need him - or you.

275
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,235
Mrs Colbert's in there.

276
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,072
- I've already told her.
- I see.

277
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,113
Here is the examination results from
ulam's. You wanna know what l found?

278
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,993
No. I don't need to look at 'em now.

279
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,350
May l examine this prisoner?

280
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,438
Yeah, you can look at him.
C'mon, let him look. Go on.

281
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,074
All right, now! Steady!

282
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,836
You finished?

283
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,796
Thank you.

284
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,513
All right, Fryer, bring him with me.

285
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,434
- Now we're grindin' corn!
- You shoulda been there!

286
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,189
If it weren't for them radios,
we woulda lost him goin' over that bridge.

287
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,198
That old boy highballing that train
like to cut us off.

288
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,390
And old Charlie's hound dog got loose...

289
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,238
- Did he confess?
- Huh?

290
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,716
The man you arrested, did he confess?

291
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,195
Well, l believe he will.

292
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,754
Yes siree, l believe he will.

293
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,996
I believe he will.

294
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,839
- He's left-handed, isn't he?
- How do l know?

295
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,549
Well, he seemed left-handed to me.

296
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,832
I believe Harvey is a southpaw.
Now, ain't he, Shagbag?

297
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,349
What if he is? What's that make him?

298
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,711
Innocent.

299
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,798
Mrs Colbert... There's just one more thing.

300
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,558
Yeah.

301
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,800
I picked it up, l tell you. He was already
lyin' there. It was lyin' there next to him!

302
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,918
I just picked it up, ma'am. That's all l did.

303
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,871
Shut up.

304
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,958
- Get him outta here.
- OK. C'mon, Harvey. Let's go.

305
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,037
Mrs Colbert, l, uh... I wonder if you'd mind
if l have somebody drive you over

306
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,517
so you could, uh...
complete the identification?

307
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,357
Martin, l want you to take
Mrs Colbert over to the funeral parlour.

308
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,471
And, Wood, run Virgil down the depot.

309
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,071
uh... Virge here, Chief,
he thinks that Harvey's innocent.

310
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,189
- Well, l'll be damned.
- Could l talk to you about it, in private?

311
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,598
No. Because l got Colbert's wallet in my
hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.

312
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,756
- You think he gave it to him?
- I don't know.

313
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,873
But Oberst could have come along
after the crime, found it, picked it up.

314
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,117
- I don't know.
- That's what the boy said he did.

315
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,993
Well, l'm sorry, ma'am, but l say different.

316
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,476
When l examined the deceased,
it was obvious the fatal blow was struck

317
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,670
from an angle of
17 degrees from the right,

318
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,679
which makes it almost certain
the person who did it is right-handed.

319
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,678
- So what?
- (Shagbag) Harve's left-handed, Chief.

320
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,758
- Everybody in town knows that.
- We figured that out.

321
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,235
Harvey's a lefty. uh-huh.

322
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,677
You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny
name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.

323
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,078
- What do they call you up there?
- They call me Mr Tibbs!

324
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,079
Mr Tibbs! Well, Mr Wood, take Mr Tibbs,
take him down to the depot.

325
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,953
And l mean, boy, like now!

326
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,916
I'll have the FBI lab
send you the report on this.

327
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,236
Not that it'll make any difference.

328
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,078
I'll take that.

329
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,676
No, you won't.

330
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,237
I'm sending it in personally.

331
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,595
(Mrs Colbert) My God!

332
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,234
What kind of people are you?

333
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,793
What kind of a place is this?

334
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,391
My husband is dead.

335
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,798
Somebody in this town killed him!
l want you to find out who!

336
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,315
You gonna give me that?

337
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,236
No, l'm not.

338
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,229
Wood, you take him,

339
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,318
and you lock him up
for withholding evidence.

340
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,396
Go on, move! Put him with
his friend, Harvey Oberst!

341
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,957
Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains
to the hogs, that's for damn sure.

342
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,114
Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.
We got another customer.

343
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,236
(Harvey) Hey, man, not in here.

344
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,432
- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button.

345
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,313
Play it cool, boy. Play it cool.

346
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,359
Hey!

347
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,556
- Hey!
- (door shuts)

348
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,398
What you doin'
wearin' white man's clothes?

349
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,198
Where d'you come from?

350
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,634
You deaf or somethin'?

351
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,751
Listen, l'm get...

352
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,153
Keep cool, Harvey.

353
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,473
I'm on your side.

354
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,477
Well, l don't need you!

355
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,556
I'm all you've got.

356
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,316
Police?

357
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,714
You're a cop?

358
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,430
- You're a cop.
- Mm-hm.

359
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,312
Yeah?

360
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,078
So, how come they locked you up?
How come they lock up a cop?

361
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,395
Who said they locked me up?

362
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,957
How come with all these empty cells here
they'd throw me in with you? You dig?

363
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,836
Look.

364
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,596
I already told 'em.

365
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,393
I see this fella lyin' on the street there.

366
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,713
And there's this wallet lyin' beside him.

367
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,394
Boy, l mean, l come into
this world outta luck.

368
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,956
Here's the first good thing
to come my way. And l pick it up.

369
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,194
But when l see whose wallet it is...

370
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,473
I mean, l start to sweat. But l heard
about this new chief. This Gillepsbie?

371
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,670
Got no more smile than a turnip.

372
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,918
So l cut across the fields, headin' for the
line, and got myself as far as the bridge

373
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,156
before Gillepsbie grabbed me.

374
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,635
What time did you find the wallet?

375
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,232
Well, l ain't got no watch, but it must have
been after two, by the courthouse clock.

376
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,591
I'm interested in eleven to two.
Where were you?

377
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,349
Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.
I got there about ten.

378
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,313
- What time'd you leave?
- Closin'. Must have been one.

379
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,399
- Anybody can swear for you?
- Packy, Bert, Les.

380
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,994
Ever been in trouble
with the police before?

381
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,957
Come on.

382
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,073
I could ask at the desk, you know.

383
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,233
Well, they brought me in one time.

384
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,238
- On account of this Delores Purdy.
- On what charge?

385
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,873
Well, uh, this Delores, she, uh...

386
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,076
she's real proud of what nature
done for her, you know?

387
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,517
And, uh...

388
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,918
Well, we was on a date
up to Clarke's Point, and, uh...

389
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,920
she says, uh... (sniggers)

390
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,278
Anyway, she asks me, she says, uh...

391
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,597
"Don't you think l got a classy build?"

392
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,836
And l say "Sure."

393
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,679
And so she starts to show me.

394
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,074
But l didn't do nothin' wrong.

395
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,556
I just didn't stop her from
tryin' to prove her point.

396
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,314
Then this cop, Sam Wood,

397
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,432
comes chargin' outta the bush
and hauls me in.

398
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,075
He let you go, didn't he?

399
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,670
Told me not to mess with her no more.
She lives on Third, a block from me.

400
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,633
Traipsin' around in the altogether.
With the lights on.

401
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,355
Now, somebody sure oughta
make her stop doin' that.

402
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,436
Come here.

403
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,715
Let me see your right hand.

404
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,514
- What you doin'?
- Hold still.

405
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,836
(door opens)

406
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,951
All right now, give him
the waiver for false arrest.

407
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,512
(Virgil) Forget it.

408
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,393
I'm askin' you to sign it. Please.

409
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,555
Give him a pen. Give him a pen.

410
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,395
All right. Let him out.

411
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,837
You'll be able to catch the 1 2.10 train.

412
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,677
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to change the charge against Oberst.

413
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,476
He was nowhere near the scene
of the crime, and l think he can prove it.

414
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,751
- I bet you know when Colbert was killed.
- About 1 2.30.

415
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,634
- While Harvey was still shooting pool.
- Wait a minute. I'll get it.

416
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,278
There's cue chalk under his nails,
not dried blood.

417
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,472
- Thank God l don't live in Philadelphia.
- One more thing.

418
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,068
Colbert wasn't killed
where the body was found.

419
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,636
- What do you mean?
- He was killed then moved to Main Street.

420
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,516
- Courtney?
- Yes, sir?

421
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,239
Change the charge to theft.

422
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,590
D'you mean Harve?

423
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,314
Who the hell else do we have back there?!

424
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,396
Yes, sir.

425
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,396
Hey.

426
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,276
Didn't l ask you to fix that gate?

427
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,071
No, not me, sir. Must have been
my brother Harold. He's on days.

428
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,989
Harold.

429
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,316
(slams door)

430
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,715
(phone rings)

431
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,637
Police department.

432
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,716
Yes, he's here. Hold on, sir.

433
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,118
Mayor's on the line, Chief.

434
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,436
(machinery noise/hammering)

435
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,837
What's all this Miz Colbert's been
tellin' me about a... a cover-up arrest?

436
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,194
No, ma'am. We ain't had no cover-up.

437
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,313
In fact, we just dropped the charges
for insufficient evidence.

438
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,878
Miz Colbert, l told you
he was nobody's man.

439
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,996
I came by to make it
as clear as l possibly can

440
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,079
that l do not want that Negro officer
taken off this case.

441
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,396
Negro officer?

442
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,510
Yeah, well, he, uh...
He comes from up North, you see.

443
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,074
And he was, uh, kinda...

444
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,474
- passin' through...
- If it wasn't for him,

445
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,832
your impartial chief of police would still
have the wrong man behind bars.

446
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,713
I want that officer given a free hand.

447
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,197
Otherwise, l will pack up
my husband's engineers...

448
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,476
and leave you...

449
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,316
to yourselves.

450
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,679
Miz Colbert, now don't you
worry about a thing.

451
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,758
Believe me, we're gonna
take care of everything.

452
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,232
Bill?

453
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,111
I wanna see you come through
this now, you hear?

454
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,630
Even if we have to
step on Endicott's toes?

455
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,671
Even that.

456
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,756
But do it fast.

457
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
All right.

458
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,759
Now, Bill, how about
this here Negro officer?

459
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,314
Miz Colbert seems
to have confidence in him.

460
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,874
Oh, he ain't nothin'. Some kind of a...

461
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,916
some kind of a homicide expert.
But l don't need him.

462
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,076
You mean you don't want him.
But you do need him.

463
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,155
Now look, Bill.
Suppose he turns up the killer.

464
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,434
He has no police power here. He's gonna
have to hand him over on a platter, right?

465
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,278
That's right.

466
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,077
And if he fails, you're off the hook, cos it
was Miz Colbert's idea in the first place.

467
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,509
See what l mean?

468
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,676
Oh, yeah.

469
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,758
Works out all the way around, Bill.
For all of us.

470
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,916
Excuse me.

471
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,554
Any reason why you have to leave today?

472
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,236
There's lots of reasons.

473
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,269
What would you say if
l asked you to stay for a while?

474
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,152
No.

475
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,078
This town needs a factory, Virgil.

476
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,668
Colbert come down
from Chicago to build it.

477
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,759
I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.
Half of them'd be coloured.

478
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,831
- Know what that means?
- Probably got him killed.

479
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,794
That's what Mrs Colbert thinks.
She wants us to catch her a killer.

480
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,559
No killer, no factory.

481
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,719
Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta
coloured people. You follow me?

482
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,069
- I'm going home, man.
- They're your people.

483
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,431
Not mine - yours. You made this scene.

484
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,997
- What do you want me to do? Beg you?
- Look, l've had your town up to here!

485
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,633
Boy, it would give me a world
of satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!

486
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,875
My father used to say that.

487
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,953
- Even did, once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.

488
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,669
Now you listen to me.

489
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,360
Just once in my life
l'm gonna hold my temper.

490
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,596
I'm tellin' you that you're gonna stay.

491
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,077
You'll stay here if l have to have your
chief remind you what he told you to do.

492
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,509
But l don't think
l have to do that, you see?

493
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,758
No. Because you're so damned smart.
You're smarter than any white man.

494
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,440
You're just gonna stay here
and show us all.

495
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,678
You could never live with yourself
unless you could put us all to shame.

496
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,914
You wanna know something, Virgil?

497
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,397
I don't think that you could let
an opportunity like that pass by.

498
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,956
(train horn)

499
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,351
Jess?

500
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,311
Jess, this is, uh...

501
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,954
This is Virgil. He's workin' for me.

502
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,916
Give him somethin' that runs. Fix him up.

503
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,350
What l fix, runs. Who pays?

504
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,352
Police.

505
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,157
Well, you know where to find me.

506
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,156
What you doin' here, man?

507
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,350
Policeman.

508
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,438
You're a policeman here in Sparta?

509
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,471
They've got a murder
they don't know what to do with.

510
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,955
They need a whipping boy.

511
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,155
You got a roof?

512
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,997
No. I'll find a motel.

513
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,276
(Jess chuckles)

514
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,869
Viola... We got company.

515
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,749
Know what's gonna happen?

516
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,836
He gonna get hisself killed.

517
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,351
You watch and see he don't.

518
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,029
I'm aware of the risk, Tom.
But, like it or not, we're stuck with him.

519
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,038
Not if the chief here is right on the ball.

520
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,677
What do you say, Chief? You got that old
killer all lined up in your front sights, hm?

521
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,555
I'm workin' on it.

522
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,830
Tom, climb off of Gillespie's back now.

523
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,714
You know damn well we didn't
hire him off a homicide squad.

524
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,558
Yeah, well, it's gonna be his week.

525
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,478
Cos Colbert's only the start.

526
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,795
I say this nigger won't live past Saturday.

527
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,119
Mrs Colbert, can you tell me
about your husband's enemies?

528
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,233
That's Endicott.
He's been fighting us all the way.

529
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,273
He sits up on his hill
and runs this county.

530
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,914
Or did, until we moved in.

531
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,116
Did your husband tell you
where he was going last night?

532
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,912
He said he wasn't sleepy. I went to bed.

533
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,714
What time was that?

534
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,909
A little after 1 1 , l think.

535
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,352
Did he call you, or anybody
on your staff, after 1 1?

536
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,072
No.

537
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,348
Maybe the elevator boy
can tell us what time he went out.

538
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,755
They put it on self-service after ten.

539
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,795
Did your husband use a car here?

540
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,876
Find anything?

541
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,470
- Whoever killed Colbert drove this car.
- How do you know?

542
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,476
Where you goin'?

543
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,595
I'd drive up there, but l'm sure you don't
want me running up there by myself.

544
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,676
- up where?
- Eric Endicott's.

545
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,279
Endicott's?! Come on, now!

546
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,598
(# "ln the Heat ofthe Night" instrumental)

547
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,752
None of that for you, huh, Virgil?

548
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,674
# ln the heat ofthe night

549
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,475
# Mm-hm, ain't a woman yet been born

550
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,391
# Yeah

551
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,232
# Knows how to make the mornin' come

552
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,712
# lt's so hard to keep control

553
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,398
# Yes, it is

554
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,229
# When l could sell my soul

555
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,476
# Forjust a little light

556
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,559
# ln the heat ofthe night

557
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,920
Listen. You know
something l don't know?

558
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,551
I found a piece of osmunda
in Colbert's car.

559
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,195
- A piece of what?
- On the brake pedal. Osmunda. Fern root.

560
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,869
Fern root? Oh, is Mr Endicott here?

561
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,470
Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.
Would you follow me, please?

562
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,435
- Gillespie.
- Mr Endicott.

563
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,550
This here's Virgil.

564
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,313
- Mr Tibbs.
- How do you do, sir?

565
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,955
Oh, may l have Henry fetch you
somethin'? Some light refreshment?

566
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,790
- No, thank you. We're all right...
- I'll have something cold, soft. Anything.

567
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,753
Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.
I'll have one, too.

568
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,836
Yes, sir.

569
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,157
I didn't know it was possible
to grow this species locally.

570
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,510
- Oh, you like flowers?
- I do.

571
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,870
Mr Tibbs, do you know
anything about orchids?

572
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,754
- Not very much, but l do like them.
- Well, let me show you.

573
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,556
Endicott's folly.

574
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,839
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful. It's breathtaking.

575
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,636
- Have you a favourite, Mr Tibbs?
- Well, l'm partial to any of the epiphytics.

576
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,115
Why, isn't that remarkable!

577
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,589
That of all the orchids in this place,
you should prefer the epiphytics.

578
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,676
I wonder if you know why.

579
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,749
Maybe it would be helpful if you'd tell me.

580
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,713
Because, like the Negro,

581
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,515
they need care and feedin' and cultivatin'.

582
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,516
And that takes time.

583
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,470
That's somethin' you can't make
some people understand.

584
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,717
That's somethin'
Mr Colbert didn't realise.

585
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,794
Is this what the epiphytics root in?

586
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,514
My point! They thrive on it.

587
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,234
Take it away from them, they do poorly.

588
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,469
- What do you call this material?
- That's osmunda. Fern root.

589
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:41,076
Well, we don't wanna take
any more of your time, Mr Endicott.

590
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,835
Why'd you two come here?

591
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,514
To ask you about Mr Colbert.

592
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,593
Let me understand this.

593
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,315
You two came here... to question me?

594
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,079
Well, your...

595
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,316
your attitudes, Mr Endicott,

596
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,716
your points of view,
are a matter of record.

597
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,037
Some people - Iet us say
the people who work for Mr Colbert -

598
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,551
might reasonably regard you as the
person least likely to mourn his passing.

599
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,756
We were just trying
to clarify some of the evidence.

600
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,476
Was Mr Colbert ever in this greenhouse?
Say, last night, about midnight?

601
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,478
Gillespie?

602
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,511
Yeah?

603
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,315
- You saw it.
- Oh, l saw it.

604
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,550
What are you gonna do about it?

605
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,233
I don't know.

606
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,596
I'll remember that.

607
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,670
There was a time...
when l could have had you shot.

608
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,599
- You better clear out. And l mean fast!
- What about that speech you gave me?

609
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,837
I didn't know you'd slap any white man!
Least of all Endicott!

610
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,758
All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.

611
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,998
I can pull that fat cat down.
I can bring him right off this hill!

612
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,072
Oh, boy.

613
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,674
Man, you're just like the rest of us.

614
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,956
Ain't ya?

615
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,394
It's all my fault.

616
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,356
But there's no point in ducking it.

617
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,074
It's gonna be tough
to keep you in your job now.

618
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:38,312
Now look here, Bill. I don't have to tell you
how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.

619
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,512
- No. I already told him to go.
- All right.

620
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,598
Now, Miz Colbert
is not gonna be back till Thursday.

621
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,711
You catch your guilty party by then,

622
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,310
she won't hold it against us we had
to send Tibbs home for his own good.

623
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,034
But you gotta do it, you hear?

624
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,116
I hear.

625
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,113
Bill?

626
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,829
What's made you change
your mind about Tibbs?

627
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,916
Who says l have?

628
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,989
Last chief we had,

629
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:14,240
he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he
slapped Endicott, claimed self-defence.

630
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,991
- Gillespie here.
- Courtney here, sir.

631
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,238
- Did you take Virgil down the depot?
- No, sir. Hejust plain wouldn't go.

632
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,318
- Shagbag saw him headin' to River Road.
- Check.

633
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,956
(car horn)

634
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,716
(car horn)

635
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,710
(car horn)

636
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,356
Hey! C'mon! C'mon!

637
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,396
(car horn)

638
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,916
(car horn)

639
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,238
Hey! C'mon!

640
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,396
(car horn)

641
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,272
OK, black boy. We come here
to teach you some manners.

642
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,118
We told you about them bad manners,
boy. You better put that down.

643
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,714
(Virgil) Why don't you
come and get it, baby?

644
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,319
(thug) C'mon, man. You ain't nothin'.
C'mon. Let's get him.

645
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,676
We'll put that round your neck.

646
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,716
Hit him, man! Get him from the side!

647
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,356
Get behind him!

648
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,075
All right, hold it!

649
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,358
All right, boys.

650
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,948
You've had your fun.
Now go on, you just run along home.

651
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,476
Nigger-lover.

652
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,188
- I didn't catch what you said.
- Get rid of the nigger.

653
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,437
You don't... we will.

654
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,028
Now, is that a suggestion,
or is that an order?

655
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,116
That's a warnin'!

656
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,832
I see.

657
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,632
I see.

658
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,834
Shut up and take this trash outta here!
Come on, move it and go!

659
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,033
Well, you finally get the message, Virgil?!

660
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,435
May l get in?

661
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,074
- Thought you left town.
- Not yet.

662
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,714
Could you follow the same route you
followed Tuesday night, same speed?

663
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,195
- Why?
- Why not?

664
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,674
- Maybe l better check with the chief.
- I wouldn't want him to slap you down

665
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,314
for steppin' outta line,

666
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,079
makin' decisions on your own,
and all that.

667
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,559
He don't knock me outta my socks.

668
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,236
Let's get rollin', Virgil.

669
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,640
# All you little birds better lock up tight

670
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,911
# Cos there's a foul owl
on the prowl tonight

671
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,276
# Hey, little lark, get outta the dark

672
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,029
# Foul owl on the prowl

673
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,596
# Cute littlejay, stay outta his way

674
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,473
# Foul owl on the prowl

675
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,035
# Youjust might be the quail he'll tail

676
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,550
# Foul owl on the prowl

677
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:30,275
# Youjust might be
the swallow he'll follow

678
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,153
# Foul owl on the prowl

679
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,353
# lfyou hear him hoot - scoot

680
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,073
# lfyou pass his tree - flee

681
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,713
# lfyou catch his eye - fly

682
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,353
# Don't wait to say goodbye

683
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,514
Take ten minutes to get myself
a king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.

684
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,273
That is, if that peckerwood
ain't sold out again.

685
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,948
- Can l bring you anything?
- No. I'm coming in.

686
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,711
I thought l told you to get outta here.

687
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,593
- I'm not ready to leave.
- I was gonna tell you, Chief.

688
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,518
- You forget about those four maniacs?
- I need more time.

689
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,518
- Do l have to put you on the train myself?!
- I guess so!

690
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,596
Whoa.

691
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,558
All right, Virgil.
Just what the hell do you want?

692
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,632
I wanna know exactly where Sam was
at all times on the night of the murder.

693
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,833
# lfyou pass his tree - flee

694
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,598
# lfyou catch his eye - fly

695
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,875
Virgil, if you get killed, we'll have one hell
of a mess in this town. You know that?

696
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,556
I know.

697
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,033
Got some real luscious cream pie
for you tonight, Sam.

698
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,038
I mean Officer Wood.
Just like you always order.

699
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:21,472
You know l don't eat that stuff. The chief
likes his boys streamlined. Right, Chief?

700
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,955
Why don't you shut up, Sam?

701
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,590
- All right, what'll you have, Virgil?
- I ain't servin' him!

702
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,873
Tuesday night you walked
out of here at 2.40. Right?

703
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,956
Right on the button.

704
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,235
Two minutes from now.

705
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,029
That's for him.

706
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,318
Now, what'd you do
when you came out that night?

707
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,635
Well, l picked up the radio and called in.

708
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,352
Do it, please.

709
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,835
Go ahead. Go ahead.

710
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,877
uh... Wood to radio.
I'm leavin' Compton's now.

711
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,151
(Courtney) Sam, look sharp.
Gillespie's sniffin' around.

712
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,236
Gimme that thing!

713
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,794
Courtney, your brother says l didn't
tell him to fix that hinge, so l told you.

714
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,751
Do you read me, Courtney?

715
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,838
- Oh, l'll get right on it, Chief.
- I'd do that if l were you.

716
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,916
Yes, sir. Ten-four.

717
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,996
All right, you can move us. Officer Wood.

718
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,399
- Why'd you do that, Sam?
- Do what?

719
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,273
Change your route
back there at the corner.

720
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,395
Who says l changed?

721
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,868
Look, l oughta know what l did!
Chief, do l have to put up with this?

722
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,355
Do l work for you, or do l work for him?

723
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,116
Good night, gentlemen.

724
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,310
I don't know.

725
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,398
- I don't know.
- Well, l appreciate anything you can do.

726
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,037
- This is highly irregular.
- Yeah, l know that.

727
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:09,109
Showing our depositors' accounts?
Hm. I don't know.

728
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,468
- You sure this is an official request?
- Yes. It's official, yes.

729
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,310
- You willing to put that in writing?
- Yeah. I'll put it in writing.

730
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,635
On police department letterhead?

731
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,036
I would write it on the head of a pin
if you want it there.

732
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,119
- I gotta have somethin' for the file.
- I realise that, but l'm in a hurry.

733
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,073
Well, we'll see.

734
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,839
He's had an account with us
for several years now.

735
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,712
That so?

736
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,716
Not a large account.

737
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,474
Never more than... Yeah.

738
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,235
$208.

739
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:59,875
That was back in '62. September.

740
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,152
I am not interested in '62 September.
I am interested in yesterday.

741
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,840
Yesterday? Well...

742
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,555
Well.

743
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:17,629
According to this,
he made a deposit of... $632.

744
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,671
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

745
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,554
- Thank you.
- Must have been when l was out to lunch.

746
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,240
A deposit that size, l'd remember.

747
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,796
Oh, you'll send me that letter
for the file, you hear?

748
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,959
I'll tell you, baby brother, the chief
didn't like him, not even from the first.

749
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,991
(door opens)

750
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,509
- Morning.
- Where do you think you're goin'?

751
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,995
(Courtney) lt's all right. Let him go.

752
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,158
I just talked to the FBI lab. We can
prove Colbert was in that greenhouse.

753
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,396
Endicott's covering up.

754
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,478
I'm afraid you're too late.
We already got the guilty man.

755
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,034
- Who?
- Sam.

756
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,750
- Sam?
- That's right.

757
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,832
Our man is Endicott.

758
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,311
You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?

759
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,637
And yesterday he makes
a big cash deposit at the bank.

760
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,115
If l told you once,
l told you a hundred times

761
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,676
that l won that matchin' quarters
and halves. It took me three years!

762
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,791
Then why was it in big bills? l checked.

763
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,754
Because whenever l got enough change,
l'd trade it in on $20 bills.

764
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,838
And when l got up to $600,
l took it down and put it in the bank.

765
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:33,795
The day Colbert was killed, he cashed
a cheque for $900, $600 of which is gone,

766
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,118
$300 of which l believe you left in the
wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!

767
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,597
- What kinda man do you think l am?!
- Now, don't you push me, boy!

768
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,235
Now listen.

769
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,874
If you weren't suspicious of Sam here,

770
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,959
why did you question him last night
when he changed his route?

771
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,953
- I knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?

772
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,834
He was afraid l'd see
some naked white girl down the block.

773
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,235
- What?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.

774
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,478
She parades around in the nude
at night to get her kicks. That's...

775
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,472
- How do you know?
- I know.

776
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,750
Well, l know. Do you understand?

777
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,872
I know that Colbert
cashed a cheque for $900.

778
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,514
I know that Sam made a big cash deposit.

779
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,599
I know that you caught him in a lie.
And l know that's enough for me.

780
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,031
C'mon, Sam.

781
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,116
Martin, lock him up.

782
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,552
Well?

783
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,919
Well... you're making a mistake.

784
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,915
Don't you bet against it.

785
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,874
You can catch your train now, Virgil.

786
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,792
Tibbs?

787
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,788
Do you think Sam did it?

788
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,918
- Where do l find the chief?
- What's it all about?

789
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,598
My business.

790
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,710
Hey, look, Purdy.

791
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,674
Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.

792
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,634
What l got to say, l say to the chief.

793
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,319
It's about Sam Wood.

794
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,872
All right.

795
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,350
- (knock on door)
- (Gillespie) Yeah?

796
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,597
(Harold) Purdy's out here, sir.
It's about Sam.

797
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,075
All right. Send him in.

798
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,154
She is gonna have a baby.
Sam Wood's baby.

799
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,154
Well, ask her yourself
if you don't believe me!

800
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,075
What are you doin' here?

801
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,312
It's important that l hear this.

802
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,598
I ain't talkin' about this
with him in the room.

803
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,789
- Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!
- You be sensible. I'm a police officer.

804
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,030
You gonna get him outta here,
or do l gotta do it?!

805
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:55,039
You ain't gonna do nothin'.
You just stand there and shut up.

806
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,472
(sniggers)

807
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,916
Sit down, little girl.

808
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,516
All right, now.

809
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,116
You tell me... all about it.
Just tell me how it happened.

810
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,596
Oh, come on. Come on, girl, speak!

811
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,757
- Well, you know how hot it's been.
- Yeah.

812
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,235
Nights, they aren't any better.

813
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,155
My brother works nights.

814
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,599
He leaves me all alone.

815
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,598
This particular night,
l go out on the porch.

816
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,314
I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be
if l had a fountain drink.

817
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,675
Sam comes down our road.

818
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,829
Just like he comes every night.

819
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,998
Passin' like a lord
in that fine, big, shiny car.

820
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,474
Only, this time he stops.

821
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,435
He's got a nice face,
don't you think, Chief?

822
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,312
So he stopped.

823
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,278
- (softly) He says...
- What? l didn't hear what you said.

824
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,356
(louder) He says...

825
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,915
"Hey, little girl,

826
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,993
you know what
the coolest spot in town is?"

827
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,438
And l said "No, Sam. I guess l don't."

828
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,399
And he said...
"The cemetery. That's where."

829
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,631
"Know why?"

830
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:45,434
"Cos they got all of them
big, cool tombstones."

831
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,314
"Ever stretch out
on a tombstone, Delores?"

832
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,831
"Feel all that nice, cool marble
along your body?"

833
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,477
- He said that?
- You hear, Chief? You hear?

834
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,556
Yeah, l hear. I hear.

835
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:10,109
All right. Sam comes along and stops in
front of your house and talks. What else?

836
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,030
Well, come on now, girl.
What else? What else? What else?

837
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,237
- Then l went for a ride with him.
- Where'd you go?

838
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,395
The cemetery.

839
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,479
So, Wood took you to
the cemetery in the patrol car, right?

840
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,115
And then things went a bit too far.
Is that what you're sayin'?

841
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,390
Did they get a little bit outta line?

842
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,273
Come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?

843
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,356
Come on, girl! ls it or ain't it?

844
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,040
- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!

845
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,479
Now, l got one more question.
Very important.

846
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,315
Did he force you, or did you let him?

847
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,956
Don't mean a damn whether
she let him or not! She is still 16!

848
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,958
In this state, that's rape!
l know the plain law on that!

849
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,834
I know the laws in the state
of Mississippi, thank you!

850
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,633
- Are you sure you're pregnant?
- Yes, l am pregnant!

851
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,798
- Courtney!
- Yes, sir?

852
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,878
Better get in here with a pad and a pencil.

853
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,440
Come on in. I want you
to take this all down.

854
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,519
You had no right to keep a nigger
in the room, shame my little sister.

855
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,876
You had no right.

856
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,228
Virge, what's happenin'?

857
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,634
- Hi, Harve.
- How are you?

858
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,194
- Fine.
- Man, uh...

859
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:40,196
- You sure saved my hide.
- Listen, Harvey. Man, uh...

860
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,949
If a guy knocks up a girl in this town,
where can he go for help?

861
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,913
- Barbershop.
- Barbershop?

862
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,796
Borrow Mr Fanning's razor
and cut your throat!

863
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,352
Well...

864
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,353
But suppose
Mr Fanning's razor is too dull.

865
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,916
Suppose he's got some
real money to spread around.

866
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,716
uh...

867
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,592
Well, uh...

868
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,673
There used to be a coloured gal.

869
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:23,272
But she kept bumpin' her price,
and l don't know if she's still in business.

870
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,836
- What's her name?
- Well, l ain't never had to look her up.

871
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,198
But, uh... Packy might know.

872
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,555
Where do l find Packy?

873
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:39,199
Down at the pool hall.
But, man, he wouldn't tell you.

874
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,035
Not unless l say so.

875
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,277
And how am l gonna say so
locked up in here?

876
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,752
Suppose l get word to Packy that you
wanna see him? Have him come here?

877
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,480
Will you let him
bring me a cheeseburger?

878
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,071
Onions?

879
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,316
Now you're talkin'!

880
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,237
(Sam) uh... Virge?

881
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,150
(footstep)

882
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,430
A little careless, ain't you, Virgil?

883
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,315
Parked in the road, you could get yourself
killed. Anybody'd know where you are.

884
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:10,278
- You know what this land is?
- Yeah. It's the site for the new factory.

885
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:16,713
I found a piece of wood in Colbert's scalp.
The lab identified it as pine.

886
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:21,197
Three people saw Colbert drive by -
alone - on the way back from Endicott's.

887
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,836
Colbert must have picked up somebody
in town and then come out here.

888
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,679
I tell you he didn't pick up nobody.

889
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,634
Sam followed him here, come up behind
him, just like l come up behind you.

890
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,275
- I heard you. Colbert would have too.
- He turned and he got smashed!

891
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,436
He was hit from behind!

892
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,757
If Delores Purdy hadn't come in,
l never would have seen the truth.

893
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,350
I was hung up trying to get Endicott,
for personal reasons.

894
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,910
Do you know what l'm gonna do, Virgil?

895
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,237
I'm gonna take you to Brownsville
and put you on the bus myself.

896
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,909
You aren't taking me anywhere.
You dig? You're holding the wrong man!

897
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:59,716
The wrong man?! l got the motive, which
is money, and the body, which is dead!

898
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,115
- What makes you so sure?
- Why do you doubt it?!

899
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,470
Because Colbert was killed here!

900
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,717
Then driven back to town in his own car
and dumped on the streets.

901
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,479
Sam couldn't have driven two cars!

902
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,996
What do you want?

903
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,796
Give me till morning.

904
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,676
(Gillespie chuckles)

905
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,995
You know...

906
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,556
You know, Virgil,
you are among the chosen few.

907
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,190
How's that?

908
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:42,110
Well, l think that you're the first
human being that's ever been in here.

909
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,634
Well, you can't be too careful, man.

910
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,394
You know a lotta things, don't you?

911
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:59,398
Well, just what do you know
about insomnia?

912
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,232
Bourbon can't cure it.

913
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:13,035
Well... that's for sure.

914
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,915
Now look. I got no wife. I got no kids.

915
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,789
Boy, l got a town that... don't want me.

916
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,756
And l got an air conditioner
that l have to oil myself,

917
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,751
and a desk with a busted leg.
And on top of that, l got...

918
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,192
this, uh...

919
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,356
place.

920
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,995
Now, don't you think that'd
drive a man to takin' a few drinks?

921
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,233
I'll tell you a secret.

922
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,316
Nobody comes here.

923
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,872
Never.

924
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,950
You married?

925
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,032
No.

926
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,396
Ever been?

927
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,272
No.

928
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,555
Ever been close to it?

929
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,468
Close to it.

930
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,795
Don't you get just... a little lonely?

931
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:03,313
No lonelier than you, man.

932
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,517
Oh, now, don't get smart, black boy.

933
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,794
I don't need it.

934
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,275
No pity, thank you.

935
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,756
No, thank you!

936
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,633
(knock at door)

937
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,835
- Yeah?
- Chief?

938
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,748
- Yeah.
- You know where l can find Virgil?

939
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,711
Who are you?

940
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:50,038
Packy, Chief. Packy Harrison.
I'm a friend of Harve.

941
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,237
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

942
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,352
- Where you goin'?
- Where whitey ain't allowed.

943
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:04,233
- What the hell does that mean?
- You gave me till morning. Remember?

944
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,116
(car engine starts)

945
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:39,634
- Here's the car.
- He could have exchanged cars by now.

946
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,638
John, you stick here. We'll keep cruisin'.

947
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,113
You find him,
come back for me, you hear?

948
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:02,070
That's her place, here.
You want me to wait?

949
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,395
No, thank you, Packy. You go on home.

950
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,756
(bell tinkles)

951
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,477
Mrs Bellamy?

952
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,913
People around here
call me Mama Caleba.

953
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:57,432
Mama, l'm not from around here.
But you can put me on my train.

954
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,470
You talk crazy. You gin-drunk?

955
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:05,148
Just homesick.

956
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,871
Lord, Lord!

957
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,390
Whisper two little words,
Mama, and l'm on my way.

958
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:17,390
Maybe... I don't want to sever
a beautiful child like you right out.

959
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,316
A man's name.

960
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,156
First name, last name.

961
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,638
The man who's paying you
for Delores Purdy's abortion.

962
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,194
You're the boy who works for Mr Charlie.

963
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,475
I thought that's who you was.

964
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,955
Why you wanna do that?

965
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,397
Why you wanna help the police like that?

966
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,273
They stealin' your soul.

967
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,517
They chew you up and spit you out.

968
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,074
I'm not here to lay a finger on you, Mama.

969
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,156
It's the white boy l want.

970
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,635
What you got against him?
He's paying for his fun.

971
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,991
How much? l bet you he's not
paying you more than a hundred.

972
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:14,559
You know how much he's got in
his pocket right now? More than $600!

973
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,552
That cracker? (chuckles)

974
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:22,639
- Where'd he come off getting 600?
- He killed Mr Colbert.

975
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,756
You gone crazy out of your mind.

976
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,633
Now listen. Hear me good, Mama, please.

977
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:33,069
Don't make me have to send you to jail.

978
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,599
A lot you care!

979
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,349
There's white time in jail, and
coloured time. The worst kind you can do

980
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,118
is coloured time.

981
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:47,637
Child... you promise...

982
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,994
give me understanding.

983
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,075
I got used to better.

984
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,514
You won't take it away?

985
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,951
I won't take it away.

986
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:08,874
Well... I don't know his name.

987
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:12,951
But she's coming here tonight.

988
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,276
Get herself straight.

989
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,433
- Leave me alone! Let me go!
- (man) Let go of her!

990
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:37,234
- Let go of her!
- Let go of me!

991
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,955
Gonna teach you, boy!

992
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,476
No club this time, man?

993
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:50,273
A gun's not smart. The way
you killed Colbert was much smarter.

994
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,316
You killed Colbert?!

995
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,273
He's crazy. Crazy.

996
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,271
(horn blares)

997
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,917
(thug) OK, nigger. Your time, nigger.

998
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,236
Look in her purse.

999
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:27,391
- What's that mean?
- She's got $100 to pay for an abortion.

1000
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,715
Listen to that. That's crazy.

1001
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,479
Money she got from Ralph.

1002
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,916
You gonna listen to him?

1003
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,793
He got her to tell you
that Sam Wood did it.

1004
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,954
He made a fool out of you, Purdy.

1005
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,955
- Delores?
- Liar!

1006
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:48,597
You stinkin' liar!

1007
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,716
(Purdy) Gimme that purse!

1008
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:08,395
You turned my little sister...
into a field slut?

1009
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,474
(Delores screams) Lloyd! Lloyd!

1010
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,353
- Hey, man, stay back!
- He's got a gun!

1011
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,596
He's dead.

1012
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,836
(Delores sobs)

1013
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,749
When l left her house,
l was going to the diner.

1014
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,838
Mr Colbert drove by,
so l hitched a ride with him. That's all.

1015
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:41,635
I said "l sure would like a job in
that new factory once you get started."

1016
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,992
And he said "Sure." And l said
"Well, l wonder where it's gonna be."

1017
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,716
He said that field we were comin' up to
was it, and he would stop and show me.

1018
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,113
I said to myself "Man, he's askin' for it."

1019
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:58,235
I said "Now, Ralph,
all you gotta do when we get out...

1020
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:03,638
is just sneak up behind him
and just... tap him."

1021
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:08,679
"And then just claim that somebody
jumped us from the bushes."

1022
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,596
That's all.

1023
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,115
I didn't mean to kill him.

1024
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,157
Yeah.

1025
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,714
All right, Courtney. That's enough.

1026
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,674
All right. C'mon, Ralph.

1027
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,670
(Ralph on tape) That's all.

1028
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,075
I didn't mean to kill him.

1029
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,354
Well, got your ticket?

1030
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,116
Here you are.

1031
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,396
Thank you.

1032
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,676
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

1033
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,996
Virgil?

1034
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:08,118
You take care. You hear?

1035
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,233
Yeah.
