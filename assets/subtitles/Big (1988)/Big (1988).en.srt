1
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:22,956
"You are standing
in the cavern of the evil wizard."

2
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,394
"All around you are the carcasses
of slain ice dwarfs."

3
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,430
"Melt... Melt wizard."

4
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,069
"What do you wanna melt him with?"

5
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,640
- Josh!
- What do ya think I wanna melt him with?

6
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,743
- I told you to take out the garbage.
- Just a second!

7
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,345
"Throw... thermal..."

8
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:49,216
- Didn't you hear what Mom said?
- One minute!

9
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,984
Joshua Baskin!

10
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,523
"Your hesitancy has cost you dearly."

11
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:03,397
"The wizard, sensing your apprehension,
unleashes a fatal bolt from the ice sceptre."

12
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,034
"With luck, you will thaw in
several million years."

13
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,937
Great

14
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,114
Come on! Josh,
it's starting to stink up the place!

15
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,283
OK, OK, OK!

16
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,656
"Take the garbage out."
Every day... "Take the garbage out." There!

17
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:34,261
The teams are getting led into the field
and the crowds are going crazy. Yeah! Yeah!

18
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:37,464
Wait. The Yankees' star pitcher
is coming outta the bull pen!

19
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,601
And the crowds are cheering.
They're going crazy!

20
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,768
- Is Billy there?
- In the back.

21
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,105
Rick Rowden
is on the mound for the Yankees.

22
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:51,044
He looks into the catcher's mitt,
shakes off the first signal, takes the curve.

23
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,281
He wipes the sweat off his brow,
leans back and fires.

24
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,417
Yeah!

25
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,754
Goodbye, Mr Spalding!

26
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,992
Here, here. Wait.

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,128
Got it. Need it. Need it. Got it.

28
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:14,168
Hey, hey, hey! Do you ever go by
Simpkins' desk when she's grading papers?

29
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,237
When she leans over,
you can see right down her shirt.

30
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:19,306
- No!
- I swear to God.

31
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,943
- Bra?
- No, she's got one of those undershirt things.

32
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,744
So if you get real close to the board,...

33
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:29,716
..you can see all the way down to her flowers.

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,385
Whoa!

35
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,121
Yeah. Gimme your gum.

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,992
- Need it. Got it. Got it. Need it...
- Hey, hey.

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,363
Oh, my God. It's Cynthia!

38
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:47,668
How did a geek like Freddie Benson
get a sister like that?

39
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:50,170
Beats me.

40
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,044
Hi, Josh.

41
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:03,116
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. It's Billy.

42
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,487
- He says hi.
- Come on, Miss Cheapo. A quarter!

43
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,857
Unbelievable!

44
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:14,161
God! She likes you. I know
she likes you. I'll find out, OK?

45
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,430
Shimmy, shimmy, go-go bop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock

46
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,366
Shimmy, shimmy, go-go bop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock

47
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,069
I met a girlfriend named Triscuit

48
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,771
She said a Triscuit's a biscuit

49
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,307
Ice-cream soda pop
Vanilla on the top

50
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,342
Ooh, sha-li-da

51
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,044
Walking down the street
Ten times a week

52
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,547
I meant it, I said it
I stole my momma's credit

53
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,015
I'm cool, I'm hot

54
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,151
Sock you in the stomach three more times!

55
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,458
Call me after supper.
Remember about Cynthia.

56
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,362
Don't worry!
I'm as interested as you are.

57
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,035
- So? Will you tell me?
- You're in.

58
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,605
- What do ya mean, I'm in?
- Cynthia Benson!

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,109
- What about her?
- Are you ready for this?

60
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,245
- She doesn't like Barry any more.
- So?

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,283
What do ya mean, "So?"
That's it - she's available!

62
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,819
- Billy, it doesn't mean...
- Josh?

63
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,758
Hey! It's after midnight.

64
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,995
- Now say good night to Billy.
- Good night, Billy. I gotta go.

65
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,932
Good night, Mrs Baskin!

66
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,468
Sweet dreams!

67
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,988
OK, I'm ready.
Here I go. I'm ready. Hurgh!

68
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,991
- Hey!
- I get one more try. One more try.

69
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,027
OK, honey, big smile. Big smile!

70
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,598
Good! Good.

71
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,934
"Wimpy"! Oh, better luck next time.

72
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:05,405
Let me get one more try. Please?
One more? I can't live with "Wimpy"!

73
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,113
Are you sure you wanna go on this, son?

74
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:17,200
- Yeah.
- No, I don't know about this one, Bob.

75
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:20,954
- No, this looks too scary.
- It's OK.

76
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,526
- Oh, my God!
- I told you. He doesn't wanna go on it.

77
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,696
- You don't have to go on it if you don't...
- No, no.

78
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:33,133
It's just that l... I wanna go on myself.

79
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:37,070
- You do?
- Yeah. I think it's something...

80
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,440
- Yeah, I think it's something I should do.
- Great.

81
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,744
Why don't we meet you at the Ferris wheel?

82
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,680
Half-hour.

83
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,982
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

84
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:00,160
Sal threw up on the other ride.

85
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,935
Josh?

86
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,937
- Oh... hi.
- Hi.

87
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,739
Have you been on this before?

88
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,942
- This?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,078
- Yes.
- Is it scary?

90
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,581
Yes.

91
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,717
Are you here alone?

92
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:24,952
Yes.

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,057
- Look. Aren't those your parents?
- Where?

94
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,359
- Right over there.
- Smile!

95
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,229
Why... yes.

96
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,466
- Hey. Who's this?
- Josh Baskin.

97
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,668
- How're you doin'?
- This is Derek.

98
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,403
He drives.

99
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,157
- Next.
- Go ahead.

100
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:50,077
- Go ahead!
- Yo, next!

101
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:56,116
Whoa. Read this sign. "You must
be at least this big to ride this ride."

102
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,584
- What?
- Ohh...

103
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:00,420
Hey, I don't make the rules.

104
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,089
Next!

105
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,757
Next!

106
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,260
Well, it's a stupid rule.

107
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,962
Look, why don't you try the kiddie wheel?

108
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,904
See you, Josh.

109
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,183
"Drop 25 cents here."

110
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,763
Come on!

111
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,340
Work! Work!

112
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,355
Neat!

113
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,004
Make my wish...

114
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,072
Right.

115
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,241
I wish I were big.

116
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,200
"Your wish is granted."

117
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,791
Honey, you'll wake up your brother.

118
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,995
Shh. Come on, come on. You sleep with me.

119
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,307
Easy, dog! Easy! Don't make me
do it. I'm only part-time.

120
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,509
Sorry!

121
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,181
Josh!

122
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,485
Josh!

123
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,290
- Josh!
- What?

124
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,661
It's 7.30! Are you up?

125
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:09,837
Come on, sleepyhead! You're gonna
miss the bus, and I can't drive you today!

126
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,895
What does he do in his sleep?

127
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:30,117
Honey? I put out some clean clothes.

128
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,353
Bring down your dungarees and stuff
for the laundry, OK?

129
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,756
OK.

130
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:40,761
- Are you getting a cold, Josh?
- No! I'm fine.

131
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,937
He's got a cold. Now Rachel's
gonna get a cold, I'm gonna get a cold...

132
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,674
Oh!

133
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,580
Oh, my God!

134
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:05,586
- Breakfast is ready, Josh!
- Be right there!

135
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,438
Josh! Hurry up! Your eggs are getting cold.

136
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,845
Hold this. Hold this.

137
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,014
Keep it a secret.

138
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,284
Bring down Rachel with you, all right?

139
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,455
OK.

140
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,858
Come on. Come on.

141
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,294
Shh-shh. Quiet, quiet.

142
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,066
You want orange juice or...

143
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:55,702
What about your breakfast?

144
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:59,867
Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?

145
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:06,340
Choo, choo, choo

146
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,612
- Don't... Please! Don't...
- Oh... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

147
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:19,686
- No, don't!
- Mom, it's me. It's Josh.

148
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,920
- I'm a grown-up.
- Stop it! Oh, God!

149
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:25,158
I made a wish last night.
I turned into a grown-up, Mom.

150
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:29,963
I made this wish on the machine and it turned
me into a grown-up - at the carnival.

151
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,900
My birthday's November 3rd.
I got a "B" in history.

152
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,570
Here, take the purse. You can have
anything that's in it. Go away!

153
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:40,307
My... My baseball team is called the Dukes!

154
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,110
Uh... I made this for you.
Who are you calling?

155
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:47,814
- Ah! I have a birthmark behind my left knee.
- Agh!

156
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,785
- You bastard! What did you do to my son?
- I am your son.

157
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,322
- Where is my child? Where is my son?
- Ma... Ma! Ma!

158
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:58,559
- Police!
- Argh!

159
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,930
Heads up! Heads up on defence!

160
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,366
Come on! All the way! All the way!

161
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:08,468
It's all yours!

162
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm open! Here, I'm open!

163
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,209
Shoot!

164
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,684
Gentlemen, the period is over.

165
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,620
- Get back to the locker room.
- Billy is a dick!

166
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,989
Wash your shirts and shorts.

167
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,391
Billy! Do us both a favour.

168
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,962
Put the balls away,
and you practise your lay-up.

169
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,699
Harvitz! Pick up that shirt
or I'll make you eat it. lt stinks!

170
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,702
Let's go, gentlemen. Let us go. Now!

171
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,204
- Billy.
- Yeah.

172
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,942
- What?
- It's me.

173
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,712
It's Josh.

174
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:54,313
- Coach Barnes!
- Wait, wait!

175
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,251
- Coach Barnes!
- Shut up! I'm your best friend.

176
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,522
Please, you gotta believe me.
I'll prove it to you. Billy, please!

177
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:06,426
- Help! Help!
- Goddamn it, Billy Francis Kopeche!

178
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:11,231
Look, I know I don't look like myself,
but something really strange happened.

179
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:16,036
I'm really scared and I need your help.
You're my best friend! I can prove it.

180
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,338
Oh...

181
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,809
The space goes down, down, baby
Down, down the roller coaster

182
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,945
Sweet, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, don't let me go

183
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Shimmy, shimmy, go-go bop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock

184
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,449
Shimmy, shimmy, go-go bop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock

185
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,785
I met a girlfriend named Triscuit

186
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,987
She said a Triscuit's a biscuit

187
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,256
Ice-cream soda pop
Vanilla on the top

188
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,524
Ooh, sha-li-da

189
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,593
Walking down the street
Ten times a week

190
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,095
I meant it, I said it
I stole my momma's credit

191
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,095
I'm cool, I'm hot

192
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,866
Sock you in the stomach three more times

193
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,705
Josh?

194
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,010
You look terrible.

195
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,413
I know.

196
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:04,718
I was in the house making
my gravy and I heard this commotion.

197
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:09,022
We're at the scene right now.
The mother's pretty hysterical.

198
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,391
It's not making any sense at all.

199
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,294
There's no ransom note,
no prints - no nothing.

200
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:18,398
- File a report, to be on the safe side.
- Shh! Quiet. Shut up!

201
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,901
- I bet he ran away.
- I wish I could.

202
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:23,270
You want me to pack your bags?

203
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,306
We go to the city,
we lay low for a couple of days.

204
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:30,143
We find the Zoltar machine, you make
a wish. You'll be home by Thursday.

205
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,914
- I can't go to New York without my folks.
- Come on! You'll be fine.

206
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,281
Here.

207
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:40,153
- Where did you get this?
- From my dad's top drawer.

208
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,306
- You stole it?
- It's his emergency fund.

209
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:46,326
- Jesus, Billy!
- Well, what do ya call this?

210
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:21,662
Fine! Fine. Kill the bitch. Kill her. Kill her!

211
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,864
With a knife. Kill the bitch with a knife.

212
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,366
Kill her! Kill her with a knife. With a knife.

213
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,735
Bitch! Kill the bitch! Kill her.

214
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:40,347
- Looking for some fun?
- No, thank you.

215
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:43,684
- Hey, man. Can you spare some change?
- No, not really.

216
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,752
Hey. This looks OK.

217
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:51,191
- No, it doesn't.
- St James, Josh. It's religious.

218
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,075
Hi.

219
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,244
Hi.

220
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:17,150
Um... w-we would like a hotel room, please.

221
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:22,256
17.50 a night for the room.
$10 deposit for the sheets.

222
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,361
Mm-mm!

223
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,997
You go straight to the top of the stairs.

224
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:33,600
It's the last door on the right.
Next to the bathroom.

225
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,070
Wait a second, I'll show ya.

226
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,642
- It smells bad.
- Shh.

227
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,378
- Have a pleasant stay.
- Thanks.

228
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:48,115
Hey, Angel!
Get outta that bathroom now.

229
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:59,893
- I don't wanna stay here by myself.
- I can't help it, Josh. I gotta be home by ten.

230
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:08,368
I'll cut classes tomorrow. We'll find
that Zoltar thing before you know it.

231
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,304
OK?

232
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,006
Just one night! All right?

233
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,977
- All right.
- Good.

234
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,481
- What if I can't sleep?
- It's probably better if you don't.

235
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,120
- See ya in the morning.
- Well... you know, like, what time?

236
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,089
8.30.

237
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,426
My mother was right! You're a pig!

238
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,863
I'd use the chain if I were you.

239
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:32,546
Mom! Mom...

240
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:39,319
- I told you, it's not a video game!
- Then what is it?

241
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,855
Well, it's not a video game.

242
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,357
This one has
a number on it. Does yours?

243
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:49,563
- No... Oh, wait. Here's one.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

244
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,001
- Do you have Zoltar?
- No, I told you. I've got Power House...

245
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,436
- We need Zoltar.
- I haven't got it.

246
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,538
- This is it.
- They're not gonna have it.

247
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:02,142
- Can I help you?
- Yes. We would like a list...

248
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,878
- ..of all carnivals and fairs.
- And arcades.

249
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:07,781
Carnivals and... fairs...

250
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,617
Uh, try Consumer Affairs.
Down the hall - room 111.

251
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:11,885
Thank you.

252
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,722
Fill this out in triplicate. $5 filing charge.

253
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,660
- See?
- You get it in six weeks.

254
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:26,567
- Six weeks?
- Sometimes longer, but you could get lucky.

255
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,603
Next, please.

256
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:31,905
Fill this out.

257
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:36,910
I'm gonna be thirty years old
for the rest of my life.

258
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:40,813
Would you come on?
We'll figure something out.

259
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:44,184
By the way...
you may be older than that!

260
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:50,224
- So now what?
- I'll come and see you every day after school.

261
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:53,861
- How?
- I'll tell them I made the basketball team.

262
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,028
- What am I gonna do?
- You can get a job.

263
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:59,199
- I can't get a job.
- Why? What are you good at?

264
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:01,301
I don't know. Making spitballs?

265
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:04,204
- How 'bout a delivery man?
- I don't know how to drive.

266
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:06,373
Yeah, right.

267
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:11,712
Cardiological technician? Civil engineer?

268
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:15,249
- You're not eating your cherry?
- Go ahead.

269
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:18,819
- Clerical transcriber?
- Billy.

270
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,254
Yeah?

271
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,262
- Gross. Oh, God! Gr... That's gross!
- Check, please.

272
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:31,098
- Go on.
- Collection agent. Company clerk.

273
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:36,970
- Computer operator. Construction engineer.
- Computer operator? Read that one.

274
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:41,108
- Will you quit with your stupid computers?
- Just read it!

275
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:45,078
- "MacMillan Toys..." Toys!
- Toys!

276
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,181
Wiggy-wiggy jazz.

277
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:50,817
MacMillan Toys. May I help you?

278
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:53,086
- Are these the applications?
- Yes.

279
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,123
OK, OK, what's next? There.

280
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:59,126
Previous employment.

281
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:02,196
- Your paper route.
- I don't think I can put that.

282
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:05,832
- Paper route circulation director?
- Yeah!

283
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,438
What's he got?

284
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,176
Hey, don't worry about it.

285
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:20,998
- Um... Social Security number?
- 32-17-25.

286
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:24,785
- What is that?
- My locker combination.

287
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:27,221
Great.

288
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,289
Mr Baskin?

289
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,557
Mr Baskin?

290
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:35,963
- Y-yes... Yes.
- The personnel director will see you now.

291
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,868
Uh... your son can wait out here.

292
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,075
OK. Son, you should sit down.
And don't give the lady any trouble, now.

293
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,344
Sure,
Dad.

294
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:55,349
- This way.
- Don't forget, look 'em in the eye.

295
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:09,630
There's two numbers missing
on your Social Security.

296
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:12,266
Oh. Uh... 12.

297
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,003
1-2.

298
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:21,642
It says here you've got four years' experience.

299
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,545
- Yes.
- All on computers?

300
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,713
Yes.

301
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,352
Where did you go to school?

302
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:35,154
It was... It was called George Washington.

303
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:39,026
Oh, GW? My brother-in-law
got his doctorate there.

304
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,530
- Did you pledge?
- Yes.

305
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:45,933
Every morning.

306
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:50,704
It happened again!
David, the girl is absolutely useless.

307
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,540
I need someone
who knows what she is doing.

308
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,977
Excuse me. I'm not getting my mail.
Nothing has been filed.

309
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,414
Ever since she got engaged,
my life has been a disaster.

310
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:02,681
She came so highly recommended.

311
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:05,652
She spent three months
writing down her married name.

312
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,920
Mrs Judy Hicks. Mrs Donald Hicks.

313
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:12,125
Mrs Judy Mitchelson Hicks - sometimes
with a hyphen, sometimes without.

314
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:15,662
Sometimes she spells the hyphen!

315
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:19,700
- Well, I really don't know where I can put her.
- Put her on unemployment!

316
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,507
- When can you start?
- Soon.

317
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:40,988
We'll start you off
with last week's preschool orders.

318
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,925
lt should take a few days -
give you a chance to find your way around.

319
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,761
- Do you smoke?
- Well, just, uh... once. But...

320
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:50,564
Only on breaks, and in the coffee room.

321
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:54,535
Most of that's pretty straightforward stuff.
Any questions, come to me.

322
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:56,937
Good luck!

323
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,542
Bye!

324
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,589
"The Dinky Link."

325
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:19,059
"Seven."

326
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,663
- "Jimmy's Toy Box."
- Psst!

327
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,799
- "Squirmey Hermey."
- Psst!

328
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:29,670
Hey. Psst. Hey!

329
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:34,675
- I'm Scott Brennen.
- Uh, I'm... I'm Josh Baskin.

330
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,977
What are you trying to do?
Get us all fired?

331
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:40,614
- Huh?
- You gotta slow down, pace yourself. Slowly.

332
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:43,650
- Slow.
- Sorry.

333
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,987
- Today's my first day.
- I know!

334
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,560
- So how long have you worked here?
- Five years.

335
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:58,565
The work stinks,
but the fringe benefits are great.

336
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,836
See that girl over there in the red?

337
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,973
Say hi to her and she's yours.

338
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:10,844
She'll wrap her legs round you so tight,
you'll be begging for mercy.

339
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,780
Well, I'll stay away from her, then!

340
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:20,020
Excuse me.

341
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,386
Brennen.

342
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:24,191
I gave it to you yesterday! Oh, here it is.

343
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:27,861
I don't have time to Xerox it.
Let the new guy do it.

344
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:30,797
- Bullshit!
- But the favourability ratings...

345
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:34,635
Let's not lie to ourselves.
If a kid likes a toy, it sells, that's all.

346
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:39,973
- But every bit of research...
- It worked in the research, not with the kids!

347
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,810
- Sorry.
- Watch where you're going!

348
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:46,213
- Are you OK?
- I am fine.

349
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:49,216
- You could kill somebody!
- It's all right.

350
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,753
The boss should get
knocked on his ass once in a while.

351
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:56,924
- Maybe you should see a doctor.
- For crying out loud, Paul, I'm fine!

352
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:59,560
- Sorry, sir.
- Where were you going, son?

353
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,899
Um... I was, uh... I was going to the Xerox
room cos they needed these by five o'clock.

354
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,901
Oh! That's good!

355
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:11,738
Nothing wrong with a little hustle.
Nothing at all.

356
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,209
Right, Paul?

357
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,348
What did he mean?
I hustle.

358
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,550
Uh, sir? Sir!

359
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:35,028
Hello?

360
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,598
Uh...

361
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,969
- Hello?
- Hello.

362
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:45,239
- Mrs Baskin?
- Yes?

363
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:49,610
- How are you?
- Who is this?

364
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:56,283
I just wanted you to know that, uh... Josh
is all right. I mean, he's OK and everything.

365
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:58,385
Do you have my boy?

366
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:01,522
Yeah... And you're gonna get him back -
just the way he was.

367
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:07,427
Look, I swear to God, if you do anything
to him, if you touch one hair on his head,...

368
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:10,764
..l will spend the rest of my life
making sure you suffer.

369
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:14,234
Wow! Thanks.

370
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:18,605
- Let me talk to Josh.
- Oh, he can't come to the phone right now.

371
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:23,177
- Why not? What did you do to him?
- I-I didn't do anything. He's a terrific kid.

372
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:26,547
I want proof that he's all right.

373
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,415
Uh... all right.

374
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:33,620
Um... ask me something that...
that... that only he would know.

375
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,024
Then I'll ask him for you,
and that way, you'll know that he's OK.

376
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:40,093
Ask him what I used to sing to him
when he was a little boy.

377
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:47,801
- Is there anything else you'd rather ask him?
- Ask him.

378
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,777
I got it! I got it.

379
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,851
Memories

380
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:07,621
Like the corner of my mind

381
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:11,458
Misty, watercolour memories

382
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,961
Of the way we were

383
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:17,297
Scattered pictures

384
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:18,465
Oh...

385
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,836
Look, you're gonna see him again -
really soon.

386
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:26,173
I- I promise. I... cross my heart and hope to...

387
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,510
Uh... we'll talk about this later.

388
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:56,270
Get down! Get down! Get out of the area!

389
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,681
- Ferris.
- Thank you.

390
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:10,184
Brennen.

391
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,886
Baskin.

392
00:34:12,986 --> 00:34:15,055
- What is this?
- Payday.

393
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:19,359
- Hey, whoa! Where's mine?
- $187?

394
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:21,028
- Yep.
- Oh! Oh!

395
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:24,131
They really screw you, don't they?

396
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:28,302
- Hi.
- Hi.

397
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,709
OK... So how would you like that?

398
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:50,224
OK. All right.

399
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,126
Three dimes, a $100 bill, and 87 ones.

400
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:04,487
One, two, three...

401
00:35:04,522 --> 00:35:06,573
More, more, more

402
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:08,642
More, more, more!

403
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:18,151
She don't like slavery
She won't sit and beg

404
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:24,491
I'm never eating again.

405
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:30,264
- It wasn't that bad.
- It was the boat ride that did it.

406
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,766
No. It was the pork rinds.

407
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,269
Pork rinds! Argh!

408
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:38,672
Achoo!

409
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:42,843
- We sure had fun, didn't we?
- Yeah. Yeah, we sure did.

410
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:44,311
A...

411
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:48,081
Booger! Booger!

412
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,469
Welcome to our world
Welcome to our world

413
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:12,039
Welcome to our world
Welcome to our world

414
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:17,377
Welcome to our world of toys!

415
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,146
Yee-hah!

416
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,982
Oh! Keep away from strange men.

417
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:26,220
Gotcha!

418
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,322
- What's your name?
- Joey. What's yours?

419
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:31,024
- My name's Josh.
- I'm gonna blow you away, Josh.

420
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:35,329
- I just got you!
- No way! That's bullshit. Get back here!

421
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:50,544
You big dork!

422
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:07,227
You work for me, don't you?

423
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:08,427
Yes.

424
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:12,099
I thought so.
What? Are you here with your kids?

425
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:14,535
No...

426
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:21,008
- Uh, I was just looking around.
- Oh...

427
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:25,379
Me, too. I come here every Saturday.

428
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,250
You can't see this on a marketing report.

429
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,221
What's a marketing report?

430
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,525
Exactly.

431
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:40,794
Come on.

432
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:45,899
- What do you think of that?
- The championship hockey?

433
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:48,535
- Yeah.
- Ooh, I love it. Only, the...

434
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:52,906
- Only, what?
- Well, the pieces don't move.

435
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,574
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the old set,...

436
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:59,980
..you could slide the men up and down
the ice. Now all they do is spin around.

437
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,550
It was more like real hockey the old way.
Why'd they change it?

438
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,419
I don't know.

439
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:09,022
The Starfighters are good -
you can change all the pieces around.

440
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:11,258
But I never liked the Galacticons.

441
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:13,827
You only get one robot,
and there's no vehicle.

442
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,663
- Mm-hm. I see.
- Plus, you can't take 'em underwater.

443
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:19,800
And if you do, they...

444
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,305
Neat!

445
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,852
OK, uh... let's check out the...

446
00:38:50,464 --> 00:38:53,667
- Piano lessons?
- Three years.

447
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:57,638
Me, too. Every day - after school.

448
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,748
"Chopsticks".

449
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:23,557
- What department are you in?
- Computers.

450
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,759
- Computers?
- Yeah. Yeah...

451
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:28,896
You just saved me a trip to the gym, son.

452
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,435
According to the marketability studies, this
thing should go straight through the roof.

453
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:37,871
- Hey! Hey! Watch it, fella.
- Sorry. Sorry.

454
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:41,275
Vice president,
in charge of product development.

455
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:43,911
He's only been here a week! Vice president?

456
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:46,480
And he came from Data Processing.

457
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:50,350
He's outta his mind.
The old man has finally lost it!

458
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,921
- Do you know he gave him Bob's old office?
- Bob's...

459
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:56,723
Bob's office is bigger than my office!

460
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:01,593
There's gotta be a reason. Things like this
don't happen without a reason.

461
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:05,599
- If the president dies, you take over?
- No, they got a hundred of 'em. Ready?

462
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,502
- Yes, Mr Baskin.
- Thank you. Come on in.

463
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,472
Look at it! It's bigger
than the principal's office.

464
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:15,609
- How do you know?
- Remember that explosion in science?

465
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,911
- Oh, yeah.
- Track-a-pillar!

466
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:19,847
59.95!

467
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,282
You know, that only costs ten bucks to make.

468
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:24,351
Get outta here!

469
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:32,292
- What is this?
- Oh, well, this... They just put this in here.

470
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:37,364
- So what do they make you do for all this?
- Well, I play with all of this stuff,...

471
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,067
..and then I go in and I tell 'em what I think.

472
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,603
- That's it?
- Yeah.

473
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:45,072
- And they pay you for that?
- Yeah.

474
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:47,508
Suckers!

475
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:51,778
Oh! Thank you, Miss Patterson.
Hey! Miss Patterson!

476
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:55,516
Could you get Media to send up
the video of the Super Bowl?

477
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:58,151
And have 'em edit out all the commercials?

478
00:41:58,218 --> 00:42:01,054
- Yes, Mr Baskin.
- Thanks.

479
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:03,023
Miss Patterson.

480
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:05,325
You're the luckiest guy I know!

481
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:12,099
- Did you check Mattel?
- Nothing.

482
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,969
- Coleco?
- Zero.

483
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:19,840
He can't come from nowhere, Susan.
How about Hasbro?

484
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,411
Yes, and Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.
I have called everywhere.

485
00:42:24,446 --> 00:42:27,014
- Nobody's ever heard of him!
- Great

486
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:31,084
Let's face it, Paul, the guy
comes from Data Processing.

487
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:33,887
Terrific! This is just terrific

488
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:36,290
You're being paranoid, Paul.

489
00:42:36,823 --> 00:42:39,860
These tests were conducted
over a six-month period,...

490
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:45,465
..using a double-blind format
of eight overlapping demographic groups.

491
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:49,769
Every region of the country was sampled.

492
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:53,006
The focus testing... showed a solid base...

493
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:57,444
..in the 9- to 11-year-old bracket,...

494
00:42:57,578 --> 00:43:01,114
..with a possible carry-over
into the 12-year-olds.

495
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:05,719
When you consider that
Gobots and Transformers poll...

496
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:08,856
- ..37 per cent market share,...
- I'm sorry.

497
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,558
..and that we are targeting
the same area,...

498
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:14,962
..I think that we should see
one quarter of that.

499
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:19,566
And that is one fifth of the total revenue
from all of last year.

500
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:24,972
- Excellent, Paul.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

501
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:28,242
- Any questions?
- Not for me.

502
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,412
Yes?

503
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:36,149
- Yes?
- I don't get it.

504
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:41,355
What exactly... don't you get?

505
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:45,526
It turns from a building into
a robot, right?

506
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:47,828
Precisely.

507
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,499
Well, what's fun about that?

508
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:56,768
Well, if you'd read
your industry breakdown,...

509
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,940
..you'd see that our success
in the action-figure area...

510
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:04,511
..has climbed from 27 per cent to 45 per cent
in the last two years.

511
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:07,447
There, that might help.

512
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,551
Oh.

513
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:17,457
- Yes?
- I-I... I still don't get it.

514
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:20,160
What?

515
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,363
- What don't you get, Josh?
- Well...

516
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:26,200
There's a million robots
that turn into something.

517
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,470
This is a building that turns into a robot.
What's fun about playing with that?

518
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:34,141
- This is a skyscraper.
- Well, couldn't it be, like,...

519
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:39,346
..a robot that turns into... into something -
like a... like a bug or something?

520
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:40,881
- A bug?
- Yeah.

521
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,717
Like a big, prehistoric insect with claws...

522
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:46,954
- ..that could pick up a car and crush it.
- In teresting.

523
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:49,423
- A prehistoric Transformer?
- In teresting!

524
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:52,059
- Gentlemen...
- The robot turns into a bug?

525
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,495
- Uh, gentlemen, listen...
- He's got a very good idea here!

526
00:44:55,596 --> 00:45:00,400
- The robot turns into a bug!
- What...

527
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:03,101
- ..different sizes...
- We could do ladybugs.

528
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:08,208
- You could have 'em wreck buildings.
- A building is inert, a bug moves!

529
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:13,146
- It's got all kinds of possibilities.
- This doesn't just happen. This guy...

530
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:16,450
He didn't just come to a meeting
and say "bugs".

531
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,020
- Uh...
- Well done, Josh. Well done.

532
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:26,894
Oho! Oh, he is vicious!

533
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:30,631
- He's not vicious.
- Don't kid yourself. That man is a killer!

534
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:35,335
- All he said was he didn't get it.
- "I don't get it."

535
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:37,538
"Let's make it a bug."

536
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:40,741
He's going for the throat.
He's trying to eviscerate me.

537
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:44,912
Did you see the look on MacMillan's face?

538
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,448
Mm-hm.

539
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:54,288
It's a unique space. The lines are so clean,
and there's none of that partition quality.

540
00:45:54,421 --> 00:46:00,060
It has 15-foot ceilings, uh...
all hardwood floors, ample closet space,...

541
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:06,300
..a modern kitchen, a brand-new bathroom
with a jet-stream Jacuzzi.

542
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,436
We'll take it!

543
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,743
Baskin. Rental delivery.

544
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:21,315
Come on, come on!

545
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,756
That was so close!

546
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:33,627
"Dear... Mom and Dad,...

547
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:36,430
..They said...

548
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:43,103
..that I could write you...
and let you know I was OK."

549
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:48,642
"So far... they're treating me fine."

550
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:52,880
"I got enough to eat,...

551
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:55,616
..and am perfectly safe."

552
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,189
"They say... I'll get out of here...

553
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:06,360
..in about... a month."

554
00:47:12,432 --> 00:47:14,902
"In the meantime,...

555
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,306
..it's a lot like camp."

556
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:23,008
"I watch TV,...

557
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:25,746
I got it! I got it! I got it!

558
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:29,716
..and even... get outside...

559
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:34,388
..once in a while."

560
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:37,024
"I know... you miss me,...

561
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:41,195
..but try not to worry."

562
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:47,034
"I think... this experience...
might even be good for me."

563
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,638
"I love you... very much,...

564
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:56,643
..and I know... I'll see you soon."

565
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,781
"Your son,...

566
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,117
..Joshua."

567
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:07,120
"PS...

568
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:11,024
..Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother."

569
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:19,867
We got off on the wrong foot.
Let's start again.

570
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,069
Hey, smell my neck.

571
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:23,937
Uh-uh.

572
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:27,774
- I'm having a lovely time.
- I'm delighted, Miss Patterson.

573
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:31,879
It's much better than last year.
I just wanted to tell you that.

574
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:38,752
- Double up on the scotch, will ya?
- Right away, sir.

575
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:47,160
- S... Susan!
- Love your tux.

576
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:50,230
I think it's the same as the maître d's.

577
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:57,304
Have you decided what you're doing
on the Danberry line?

578
00:48:57,339 --> 00:48:58,872
No. I haven't.

579
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:03,143
Well, uh... I think if you got
everyone's input upfront,...

580
00:49:03,243 --> 00:49:07,614
- ..I mean, right from the beginning...
- Susan... have a drink.

581
00:49:07,748 --> 00:49:10,450
- What?
- Have a couple of drinks.

582
00:49:11,485 --> 00:49:13,787
It's a party.

583
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,949
Oh, God!

584
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:47,788
Josh! Glad you could make it.

585
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:52,993
- I bet he gets another raise.
- Now that's what I call a tuxedo!

586
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:57,364
I rented it. This is a real bow tie,
though - I tied it myself.

587
00:49:57,399 --> 00:50:01,352
- That's why I was late.
- You're not late. Let me show you around.

588
00:50:01,387 --> 00:50:05,305
Hey, there's Miss Patterson. Hi!
There's the guy from the meeting! Hi!

589
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:20,187
..it only works on your hips. You need
a whole 'nother exercise for your thighs.

590
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,389
Hi.

591
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:42,843
Let me grab a plate here.

592
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,012
Excuse me.

593
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:52,719
The guy's a goddamn knock-off artist.

594
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:56,390
Amphibian? He takes 10,000 Gl Joes,...

595
00:50:57,858 --> 00:51:02,029
..slaps some gills on 'em, webs their feet,
packages them in seaweed.

596
00:51:02,064 --> 00:51:04,298
Oh... Come on!

597
00:51:36,864 --> 00:51:42,769
So I show him the schedule, and he
says "It's not correct accounting procedure."

598
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:45,606
- The goddamn prick!
- But the toy sold, Paul.

599
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:47,774
Excuse me.

600
00:51:51,311 --> 00:51:54,047
- Hi.
- Hi.

601
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:57,584
All the same people,
having all the same discussion.

602
00:51:57,684 --> 00:52:00,621
It's like they cloned some party in 1983...

603
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:04,658
..and kept spinning it out,
again and again and again.

604
00:52:05,926 --> 00:52:10,631
- I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll line.
- Thanks.

605
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,834
They were so... incisive.

606
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:22,176
It's beluga. MacMillan orders it every year.

607
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:28,015
Sidle up to him and then ask for a raise.

608
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:39,493
Gesundheit.

609
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:41,695
All right?

610
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,631
Are you OK?

611
00:52:44,698 --> 00:52:47,134
Do you want a glass of water?

612
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:53,807
- Do you want something to drink?
- Could I have a milk shake or something?

613
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:56,109
I got a car outside.
Wanna get outta here?

614
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,579
- Uh-huh.
- Let's go.

615
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,052
Watch it!

616
00:53:09,223 --> 00:53:14,862
I'm not really a big one for parties. I like
things that are a little more, uh... intimate.

617
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:18,298
Wow! Is this your car?

618
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:20,901
Well, it's the company's car.

619
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:24,137
Oh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen!

620
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,743
Sir.

621
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:44,558
Just seeing someone in the office,
you don't really get a chance to know them.

622
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:47,194
Just being with you here,
I really get a sense...

623
00:53:47,261 --> 00:53:50,397
..of who you are.

624
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:52,599
- Are you gonna eat these?
- No.

625
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:57,004
- Hey, mister? You want some of these fries?
- No. No, thank you. No.

626
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:00,541
See, it's hard in a business situation. I...

627
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:05,746
I mean, there's...
there's this invisible line, and, uh...

628
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:09,716
..even if... even if
you're attracted to someone...

629
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:14,087
- You're gonna call someone before...?
- No.

630
00:54:15,222 --> 00:54:17,090
Uh...

631
00:54:17,224 --> 00:54:19,926
I mean, at this point in my life...

632
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:22,629
Don't... Don't play with the ra...

633
00:54:22,664 --> 00:54:25,566
Leave the, uh... Don't...

634
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:28,769
I'm really vulnerable right now!
You know? And I...

635
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:33,774
I mean, I love my job, and...

636
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:37,644
- ..and I...
- Ejector seat!

637
00:54:37,744 --> 00:54:39,813
Hot in the city

638
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,850
Hot in the city tonight

639
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:44,735
Tonight

640
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:45,751
All right

641
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:47,855
This is great!

642
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,091
Hey! Come on up!

643
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:06,006
- That was my apartment.
- Really?

644
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:08,709
- Yeah.
- I'd love to see where you live.

645
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,353
Have you always lived alone?

646
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:22,155
- No. Not always.
- Oh.

647
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,358
Is it just recently, or...

648
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:29,796
- Yeah...
- Give yourself a couple of days, it'll pass.

649
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:32,900
Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks.

650
00:55:33,734 --> 00:55:36,435
Well... it can be painful, but...

651
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,641
..that's what they invented
Xanax for, right?

652
00:55:40,676 --> 00:55:43,443
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

653
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:49,683
I'm not sure we should do this yet.

654
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:53,153
- Do what?
- Well, I...

655
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:58,158
I mean, I like you, and I...
I wanna spend the night with you...

656
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:03,997
D'you mean sleep over?

657
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,835
Well...

658
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,037
..yeah!

659
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:15,242
OK. But I get to be on top.

660
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,495
- You live here?
- Yeah.

661
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,799
It's nice, isn't it?

662
00:56:41,101 --> 00:56:43,203
Yeah...

663
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:46,406
You, uh... you want a soda?

664
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,075
Huh?

665
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:51,345
- A soda. You want one?
- Yeah. Sure.

666
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,983
I rigged this up
so you don't need any quarters.

667
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,052
Oh! Don't... No... no, don't.

668
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,188
- What?
- The glue is not dry yet. Sorry.

669
00:57:03,223 --> 00:57:06,960
- Sorry!
- It's OK. You didn't break anything.

670
00:57:08,862 --> 00:57:11,231
- You wanna play pinball?
- No.

671
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:15,169
- You don't need quarters for this either.
- No, thank you.

672
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:17,404
OK.

673
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:23,243
- Is that a trampoline?
- Yeah. You wanna try it?

674
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,778
No!

675
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:27,579
You should. It's really fun.

676
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:29,681
It's simple, too. Come on. Come on.

677
00:57:29,716 --> 00:57:32,619
- You'll like it. It's easy, too.
- Do you have some wine?

678
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,590
- Take off your shoes.
- Maybe we could talk for a few minutes.

679
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:39,159
Jesus! Gimme the other one.

680
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:45,566
OK. Now watch. It's really simple.
Let me just get my big balls off here.

681
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:52,506
- No, really, I... I'll watch.
- Come on. It's fun! I'll do it with you. Hup!

682
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,374
Excellent.

683
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:57,010
- Help me up?
- Sure.

684
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:03,050
OK... jump.

685
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:06,286
- You want me to jump?
- Yeah. Just jump.

686
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:11,925
- There. Now we can have a drink.
- No, no, no, no, no! Really jump.

687
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:15,162
Stand here and get in the air
and all... Go ahead.

688
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:18,298
Get some air between you and the tramp-...

689
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:21,001
..oline.

690
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:25,806
- There.
- Oh, come on! I'll do it with you, all right?

691
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:29,409
Ready? Come on. OK, jump. See?
Just this - that's all there is...

692
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:32,779
That's all there is to it. Good. Good.

693
00:58:33,947 --> 00:58:36,650
There you go. There you go. Yeah!

694
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:42,990
It's easy! Anybody could do this.

695
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,058
Woo!

696
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:54,868
Hello! How do you do that?

697
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:02,509
Good!

698
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:23,764
Uh!

699
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:34,908
- Oh! Hi.
- Here.

700
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:37,845
- What?
- Pick one.

701
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:43,650
OK, try again.

702
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,321
That one.

703
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:52,626
It's for you. It's a glow-in-the-dark
compass ring, so you won't get lost.

704
01:00:14,515 --> 01:00:16,617
Good night.

705
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:39,339
Had fun last night?

706
01:00:40,707 --> 01:00:45,312
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah... Yeah, you left pretty quick.

707
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:49,283
- I gave him a ride home, Paul.
- Oh! Did he enjoy it?

708
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:52,819
- Don't be ridiculous.
- That's me, Mr Ridiculous

709
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,322
Mr Silly Old Guy!

710
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:01,795
I don't feel like going out tonight.

711
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,498
What do you mean? They're
your friends.

712
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:07,000
I know.

713
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,102
Leave it!

714
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:11,038
Hot in the city...

715
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,238
Will you quit it?

716
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:17,010
You have to play with everything?

717
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:22,015
Argh!

718
01:01:25,152 --> 01:01:27,221
Baskin?

719
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:29,122
Baskin?

720
01:01:36,597 --> 01:01:41,068
Wouldn't you rather play basketball? We
could be a team for the MacMillan company.

721
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:44,937
- No.
- My best sport's video hockey.

722
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:47,741
- It's not a sport.
- It takes eye-to-hand coordination.

723
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:51,845
- It's not a sport if you don't sweat!
- What about golf? That's a sport.

724
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:54,982
- Yeah, a machine doesn't do all the work.
- What about car racing?

725
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:57,985
- Ah, shut up, Baskin!
- What are the rules again?

726
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:04,157
I told you. Over the line on the serve,
yellow is out of bounds, play to 21. Ready?

727
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:06,627
Oh! Sorry... Sorry.

728
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:08,529
- One-nothing!
- Hold it.

729
01:02:08,595 --> 01:02:11,331
Go! Get it, get it, get it, get it,
get it! Attaboy!

730
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:14,168
- OK, you ready?
- Yeah.

731
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,338
- Oho! Nice try!
- That was in.

732
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:22,910
Two-zip. Just made it. Two-zip.
Ready? Here we go!

733
01:02:30,017 --> 01:02:32,586
That was in. Good. Point.

734
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,254
Whoa!

735
01:02:34,988 --> 01:02:37,591
- What's the matter?
- Time!

736
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:44,398
Backhand.

737
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:46,767
Yes!

738
01:02:49,803 --> 01:02:51,905
- 19-18.
- That was under the line.

739
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:55,309
- What?
- You said it had to be over the line.

740
01:02:55,642 --> 01:02:58,979
- No, I didn't.
- You said it had to be over on a serve.

741
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:02,549
No, I did not! Now gimme the goddamn ball!

742
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:06,086
- That's cheating!
- Gimme the goddamn ball, will ya?

743
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:08,255
- No.
- Gimme the ball, you little shit!

744
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:10,422
- It's my serve.
- Gimme the ball!

745
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:13,994
- Gimme the goddamn ball! I never said that!
- Yes, you did.

746
01:03:16,096 --> 01:03:18,465
Gimme... Gimme the ball.

747
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:21,066
Gimme the ball!

748
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:24,238
Gimme the... Gimme the...

749
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:28,175
Gimme...! Give me the ball.

750
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:32,980
- You're a cheater.
- I do not cheat. Give me the ball.

751
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,316
Give me the ball!

752
01:03:41,722 --> 01:03:44,623
Gimme the... Gimme the ball!

753
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:47,995
All right. But let's take it over.
We'll take it over!

754
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:54,268
- He didn't have to punch me.
- I know.

755
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:57,804
He's scared of you.

756
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,076
- You don't play his game.
- I tried to play his game. He beat me up.

757
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:08,015
If he's scared of me,
then why did he punch me?

758
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:11,218
He punched you because he's scared of you.

759
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:15,923
- I don't get it.
- It's just the way he is.

760
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:20,827
Everything's a fight with him.
Everyone's an enemy.

761
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:23,864
It's not just a job for him, it's a war.

762
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:33,340
Then how come you're so nice?

763
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:35,943
What?

764
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,679
You work as hard as he does
and you're not like that.

765
01:04:38,745 --> 01:04:40,948
You don't... You don't know me that well.

766
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:44,384
Yes, I do.

767
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:48,355
You're one of the nicest people I've met.

768
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,196
How do you do it?

769
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,917
- Soixante...
- Soixante-dix.

770
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:20,254
- What's this?
- Shampoo, razor, toothpaste,...

771
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:22,689
- ..two ties and an exercise tape.
- Susan...

772
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:25,592
Oh, and I want my keys back.

773
01:05:28,295 --> 01:05:30,397
Sure.

774
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:34,968
It's just some scratches.
He'll get over it.

775
01:05:35,169 --> 01:05:39,640
- It's... It's nothing to do with him.
- He's just another link in the chain!

776
01:05:39,973 --> 01:05:44,978
First it was, uh, Tom Caulfield,
then Hanlen, then Golding, then me.

777
01:05:45,013 --> 01:05:48,749
- Am I missing somebody?
- It's not like that any more.

778
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:51,952
What is so special about Baskin?

779
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:55,189
He's a grown-up.

780
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:57,055
Susan...

781
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,993
I can't believe you brought up Golding.

782
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,442
Catch. Catch the dough. Catch.

783
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:17,945
How many pieces of dough we got here?

784
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:20,848
Here they come! Throw me the ball.

785
01:06:23,217 --> 01:06:24,818
My God!

786
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,623
He got it! He's really good!

787
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:37,130
- Happy birthday to you
- Surprise!

788
01:06:37,197 --> 01:06:41,168
Happy birthday to you

789
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:46,073
Happy birthday, dear Josh

790
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:54,014
Happy birthday to you

791
01:06:55,048 --> 01:06:56,915
And many more!

792
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,720
Happy birthday to you.

793
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:02,856
- You!
- Hey.

794
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,193
What are you gonna wish for this time?

795
01:07:12,866 --> 01:07:16,301
I know, we can get some beers,
some dirty magazines...

796
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:20,374
- Um... I can't, Billy.
- Of course you can. It's your birthday.

797
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:23,277
- I have to go somewhere.
- Where? Where?

798
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,512
Um...

799
01:07:26,013 --> 01:07:29,049
Well, I have to go meet somebody, and...

800
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:32,551
- You got all night.
- Yeah, I know, but...

801
01:07:32,586 --> 01:07:37,257
See, I just... Well, I can't right now, OK?
But I'll call you, all right?

802
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:40,928
OK? I'll give you a call.

803
01:07:42,596 --> 01:07:45,532
Oh, and thanks again, Billy. lt was fun.

804
01:07:52,005 --> 01:07:54,074
- Hi.
- Hi.

805
01:07:57,211 --> 01:08:00,113
- Do you wanna come in?
- Sure.

806
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:19,933
Sit down.

807
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:38,585
- Want to go?
- Yeah! Yeah.

808
01:09:06,246 --> 01:09:08,382
Wanna go again?

809
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:12,553
They have cars that you can drive,
except they're on a rail.

810
01:09:12,686 --> 01:09:15,923
- Like a coaster ride.
- So you're not really...

811
01:09:16,023 --> 01:09:19,459
- You have a big gob of mustard right there.
- What?

812
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,028
- Mustard.
- Where?

813
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,330
Right there.

814
01:09:26,967 --> 01:09:31,338
- Is it gone?
- Well... Well... Here.

815
01:09:34,374 --> 01:09:37,177
- That... gone?
- Yeah.

816
01:09:43,217 --> 01:09:46,887
- Listen.
- Oh... Oh, music?

817
01:09:51,892 --> 01:09:54,194
Wanna dance?

818
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:56,563
Dance?

819
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:58,999
- We don't have to if you don't want to.
- OK.

820
01:09:59,066 --> 01:10:01,368
- All right.
- OK.

821
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:06,507
- Are you cold?
- Mm-mm.

822
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,378
We could get some hot chocolate.

823
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,517
You can wear my jacket if you want.

824
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:43,610
I haven't done this in a long time.

825
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:57,391
What were you like when you were younger?

826
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:03,630
- Oh, well, I wasn't much different.
- I believe that about you.

827
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:16,643
I've been thinking about you a lot.

828
01:11:19,379 --> 01:11:21,849
It's... crazy.

829
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:26,787
In my car,...

830
01:11:26,854 --> 01:11:29,590
..lying in bed...

831
01:11:33,026 --> 01:11:36,396
I've just never gone out
with someone like you.

832
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:41,602
With all the other men,
there was so much to hide.

833
01:11:44,505 --> 01:11:47,508
I feel like I can tell you anything.

834
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:52,646
Susan?

835
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:54,815
Susan...

836
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:01,622
There's something I think I should tell you.

837
01:12:02,456 --> 01:12:04,525
What?

838
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:20,667
You want the light on?

839
01:14:06,313 --> 01:14:10,918
- Good morning, Mr Baskin.
- Good morning. Hey, Brett, how are ya?

840
01:14:10,984 --> 01:14:13,287
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Josh.

841
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,687
Josh, my man!

842
01:14:15,722 --> 01:14:17,991
- Morning.
- Morning.

843
01:14:19,893 --> 01:14:23,430
- Good morning, sir.
- I'd like some coffee, please, Miss Patterson.

844
01:14:23,497 --> 01:14:27,367
- But you don't drink coffee!
- And, uh... make it black.

845
01:14:32,372 --> 01:14:36,343
You know, you two should come to Vermont.
It is so pretty up there right now.

846
01:14:36,443 --> 01:14:40,314
- We spent our anniversary there.
- All you did was watch TV!

847
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:44,918
I popped popcorn, too. We watched
that intellectual stuff, you know.

848
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:50,190
Did anybody see that great documentary
about Columbus on PBS the other night?

849
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:52,693
- Mm-mm.
- Um, no. Was it good?

850
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:56,230
- I had no idea he had a fourth ship.
- Yeah, the Santa Cristina.

851
01:14:56,363 --> 01:14:59,700
- That's right.
- He only had that on his second trip.

852
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,402
- You saw it, too.
- No.

853
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:07,007
- But I-I used to... study, you know, that stuff.
- Really?

854
01:15:07,074 --> 01:15:11,378
- Dad... I need some help with my algebra.
- Not now, Adam.

855
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:14,181
- Yeah, but, Dad...
- Adam, we have guests.

856
01:15:14,314 --> 01:15:17,182
He has had the roughest
time with algebra.

857
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:20,420
- We've tried tutors, everything.
- With algebra?

858
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:24,324
- I used to study that, too.
- Isn't that nice?

859
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,096
Let's say Larry Bird's gonna score
ten points in the first quarter.

860
01:15:29,131 --> 01:15:32,432
- How many will he score in the whole game?
- 40 points.

861
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:35,369
- Probably, OK? And that's algebra.
- Right.

862
01:15:35,404 --> 01:15:37,437
- But, it is...?
- Yeah.

863
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:43,177
One quarter is to ten points that
he scores in that quarter. Just as four...

864
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:46,280
You're right. He's wonderful.

865
01:15:46,413 --> 01:15:48,382
I know.

866
01:16:17,144 --> 01:16:19,580
"Department of Consumer Affairs"?

867
01:16:22,716 --> 01:16:25,018
Yeah, buddy! It came!

868
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:29,354
He's never done this before.

869
01:16:29,389 --> 01:16:33,126
Get the art department on the phone.
Get them, get them!

870
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:36,263
- Send out for some sandwiches.
- Cajun or deli?

871
01:16:36,298 --> 01:16:39,364
Maybe next year, Brian. Next year.

872
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:42,102
- You can do it.
- I cannot plan a whole line!

873
01:16:42,202 --> 01:16:44,905
Why? Nobody knows
more about toys than you.

874
01:16:45,038 --> 01:16:48,575
Susan, doing that means marketing
and strategy and stuff like that!

875
01:16:48,642 --> 01:16:50,944
- All he wants is a proposal.
- I can't...

876
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:55,048
You come up with the ideas and...
I'll handle the marketing.

877
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:58,252
- But...
- Come on, it'll be neat.

878
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:03,991
Well, l... I don't know. I don't have
any ideas for new toys or anything.

879
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:07,327
Yeah, well, tell him I called again.

880
01:17:07,427 --> 01:17:10,964
- I'll tell him, Mr...
- Kopeche. K-O-P...

881
01:17:11,098 --> 01:17:13,800
- You know, he's been very busy.
- Yeah, right

882
01:17:13,901 --> 01:17:16,503
Well, tell him it's important.

883
01:17:18,071 --> 01:17:21,942
See, it won't be like these,
where you just follow the story along.

884
01:17:22,009 --> 01:17:27,147
You would actually make a whole different
story appear, just by pressing these buttons.

885
01:17:27,182 --> 01:17:29,850
An electronic comic book? That's amazing!

886
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,986
Like a living comic book.
lt'll be different every time.

887
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:35,088
This is incredible. You're brilliant.

888
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:39,660
If you like one, you could see it
over and over and over again.

889
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:43,697
You're... You're wonderful.

890
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,333
Do you really like it?

891
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:49,670
- Really?
- Really.

892
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:54,474
- You think Mac will like it?
- I think...

893
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:58,412
You know what we can do?
We could do, like, sports comic books,...

894
01:17:58,512 --> 01:18:02,482
..where, like, if you're going to
steal second or something like that.

895
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:05,385
We could have sports books -
baseball, football...

896
01:18:05,519 --> 01:18:08,222
Really, it would work for
almost any sport. Hockey!

897
01:18:08,322 --> 01:18:11,358
What... What... What is it we're doing?

898
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:13,527
Huh?

899
01:18:15,729 --> 01:18:18,031
What... What's... What's going on here?

900
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:20,968
Well... you know, we're...

901
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:25,739
Something wrong?

902
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:29,776
- You don't like it?
- No! No.

903
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:32,012
It's...

904
01:18:33,247 --> 01:18:36,450
I mean, if it's an affair,
that's one thing.

905
01:18:37,618 --> 01:18:39,786
But if it's...

906
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,222
If... If it's something else...

907
01:18:46,059 --> 01:18:51,398
Not that we have to know right now. But if we
think that it could turn into something else,...

908
01:18:51,465 --> 01:18:53,700
..well...

909
01:18:58,272 --> 01:19:01,208
How do you feel about all this?

910
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:04,545
How do I feel about what?

911
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:10,050
Well, how do... how do you... feel about me?

912
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:28,602
What... What is that supposed to mean?

913
01:19:38,545 --> 01:19:40,814
Agh!

914
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,661
Wednesday would be better than Thursday.

915
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:58,232
- Mr Baskin can't be...
- Yeah, I have the key example right here.

916
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:01,668
Where you been? I've been
trying to reach you!

917
01:20:01,768 --> 01:20:04,805
- I'm... I'm in the middle of something, OK?
- I got the list.

918
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:10,010
- Can you give me a minute, please? Yes.
- What? This is it. This is the list!

919
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:13,580
Would you come back at lunch?
I'm a little bit busy right now.

920
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:14,980
- Hello?
- Busy?

921
01:20:15,015 --> 01:20:17,117
- Billy!
- Are you outta your mind?

922
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:21,688
- Jesus, Billy! Miss Patterson!
- It's what we've been waiting for!

923
01:20:21,788 --> 01:20:25,726
I got work to do, can't you understand that?
I got a deadline to meet. God!

924
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:46,580
I'm your best friend.
What's more important than that, huh?

925
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:53,887
And I'm three months older
than you are, asshole!

926
01:21:38,999 --> 01:21:42,919
"You are standing in the cavern
of the evil wizard."

927
01:21:42,954 --> 01:21:46,840
"All around you are
the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs."

928
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:52,679
"Melt wizard."

929
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,653
"What do you want to melt him with?"

930
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:11,031
"Throw thermal pod."

931
01:22:14,668 --> 01:22:16,970
Race you!

932
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:19,173
Come on!

933
01:22:48,035 --> 01:22:52,539
- Boys! Time for dinner!
- Just five more minutes.

934
01:23:57,404 --> 01:23:59,773
Josh? What's wrong?

935
01:24:04,678 --> 01:24:06,847
What is it?

936
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:15,556
I haven't told you something
because I didn't think you'd believe me,...

937
01:24:15,622 --> 01:24:18,258
..and I didn't think
you'd like me any more, so...

938
01:24:18,325 --> 01:24:22,930
Oh, honey, come here!
You can tell me anything. What?

939
01:24:28,869 --> 01:24:31,471
Susan, I'm not what you think I am.

940
01:24:33,974 --> 01:24:35,843
What do you mean?

941
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:39,947
Before I met you, I was in Little League.

942
01:24:41,048 --> 01:24:43,015
Um... I was in Little League,...

943
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:47,254
..and I rode my bike to school,
and I played with my friends and hung out...

944
01:24:47,289 --> 01:24:50,991
Jo... Josh, what are...
what are you talking about?

945
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,462
I wanna go home.

946
01:24:57,231 --> 01:25:00,033
I miss my family, Susan,
and I wanna go home.

947
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:02,870
Oh, my God! You're married!

948
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:06,507
- No! No... I'm not married.
- I knew this was too good to be true.

949
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,611
- There had to be something!
- S... Susan, I'm not married.

950
01:25:10,677 --> 01:25:12,779
- You're not?
- No.

951
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,016
I'm a child.

952
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:18,385
What?

953
01:25:18,519 --> 01:25:23,924
I'm a child, Susan. And I...
I'm... I'm not ready for all of this!

954
01:25:24,558 --> 01:25:28,729
Oh, that's fine. That is... That's just great

955
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:30,831
- What happened...
- No, I understand.

956
01:25:30,898 --> 01:25:35,269
- "I'm not ready to make a commitment."
- No! No, you don't understand.

957
01:25:35,402 --> 01:25:38,338
- I... I'm 13 years old.
- Oh, and who isn't?

958
01:25:38,405 --> 01:25:41,241
You think there isn't
a frightened kid inside of me?

959
01:25:41,341 --> 01:25:44,178
No, I mean I really am thirteen!

960
01:25:44,244 --> 01:25:49,383
I went to bed one night and I was a kid,
and when I woke up, I was a grown-up.

961
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:53,754
Oh, right And just yesterday,
I was a schoolgirl with pigtails

962
01:25:53,854 --> 01:25:56,490
- Why are you doing this?
- There was a carnival...

963
01:25:56,557 --> 01:25:59,693
- Please!
- I made a wish on the Zoltar machine.

964
01:25:59,826 --> 01:26:01,361
Oh, stop it!

965
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:05,532
The Zoltar machine had this bobbing head
that looked just like a devil!

966
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:10,037
If you got a quarter in his mouth, you could
make a wish. I did! I made a wish to be big.

967
01:26:10,103 --> 01:26:14,508
What I'm trying to tell you is, I changed
into a grown-up, but I'm really just a kid!

968
01:26:14,608 --> 01:26:17,311
Fine, Josh. You're a kid.

969
01:26:20,113 --> 01:26:23,383
Look, I don't know what it is
that you're trying to tell me,...

970
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:28,889
..but we have a very big presentation to give
tomorrow, so I'm gonna get some sleep.

971
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:38,265
Stupid stuff! Dumb stuff!

972
01:26:38,398 --> 01:26:40,901
Some friend! I don't need him.

973
01:26:45,072 --> 01:26:47,341
Stupid jacket!

974
01:26:52,145 --> 01:26:54,248
Josh?

975
01:26:58,185 --> 01:27:00,287
Josh!

976
01:27:03,824 --> 01:27:06,560
Oh... Hi, Mrs Baskin.

977
01:27:17,471 --> 01:27:19,573
Hiya.

978
01:27:19,673 --> 01:27:22,609
I was just looking around in here.

979
01:27:22,644 --> 01:27:24,978
Hm.

980
01:27:25,112 --> 01:27:28,515
- Your hair's getting longer.
- I got it cut yesterday.

981
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:31,018
Oh.

982
01:27:33,954 --> 01:27:36,023
He had a birthday.

983
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,859
I... I know.

984
01:27:40,961 --> 01:27:43,463
He'll be coming back real soon.

985
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:48,969
Everything's gonna be OK.

986
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:54,308
- I hope so.
- Good night.

987
01:28:30,577 --> 01:28:33,514
Right there! Sea Point Park, New York.

988
01:28:38,519 --> 01:28:40,821
Well?

989
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:46,527
- Yes?
- They're waiting for you.

990
01:28:53,934 --> 01:28:55,702
Thanks.

991
01:28:55,836 --> 01:28:58,205
See you around.

992
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:11,051
There's this flat screen on the inside
with pictures on it.

993
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:15,022
You read it, and when you get to the bottom,
you have to make a choice...

994
01:29:15,088 --> 01:29:20,427
..of what the character's gonna do - if he's
gonna fight the dragon, you push a button.

995
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:26,667
- Paul?
- I don't get it.

996
01:29:26,967 --> 01:29:28,635
- Well...
- Paul!

997
01:29:28,869 --> 01:29:32,739
- It's a comic book...
- See, there's a computer chip inside,...

998
01:29:32,806 --> 01:29:38,045
..which stores the choices. At the end
of a page, you decide where the story goes.

999
01:29:38,145 --> 01:29:40,447
- That's the point.
- Terrific, Susan.

1000
01:29:41,148 --> 01:29:44,484
- The kid makes his own decision.
- This is possible?

1001
01:29:44,618 --> 01:29:47,321
Yeah! In fact, it's a very simple program.

1002
01:29:48,155 --> 01:29:50,657
Isn't that... Isn't that right?

1003
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:55,262
So what happens
when you run out of choices?

1004
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:58,999
That's the great thing.
You can sell different adventures.

1005
01:29:59,099 --> 01:30:02,769
Just pop in a brand-new disk,
and you get a whole new set of options.

1006
01:30:02,836 --> 01:30:06,707
- We could market this on a comic-book rack.
- Mm-hm.

1007
01:30:07,341 --> 01:30:09,408
I'll be right back.

1008
01:30:09,443 --> 01:30:12,012
How much would the unit cost?

1009
01:30:12,145 --> 01:30:16,116
Well, our initial figure
was around, uh... seven...

1010
01:30:18,285 --> 01:30:20,354
..around seven dollars,...

1011
01:30:20,487 --> 01:30:26,193
..with a retail cost of about... 18.95.

1012
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:31,732
Well, you expect a kid
to pay $19 for a comic book?

1013
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:34,268
I think a kid...

1014
01:30:40,908 --> 01:30:43,443
Will you excuse me?

1015
01:30:50,317 --> 01:30:52,386
Josh?

1016
01:30:52,486 --> 01:30:54,555
Josh!

1017
01:31:09,069 --> 01:31:11,872
Will you take me
to Sea Point Park, New York?

1018
01:31:12,005 --> 01:31:14,575
Sea Point Park? Josh!

1019
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,376
- Not so fast!
- Here.

1020
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:19,379
Josh! Josh!

1021
01:31:20,147 --> 01:31:22,716
See you back home!

1022
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:25,152
Yeah!

1023
01:31:25,219 --> 01:31:28,020
Excuse me. Uh... do you know him?
You know Josh?

1024
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:31,792
- Yeah... Yeah.
- Look, you have to tell me where he went.

1025
01:31:31,892 --> 01:31:34,528
- Who are you?
- I'm...

1026
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:41,068
- I'm his girlfriend.
- Euch!

1027
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:45,172
- Billy Kopeche.
- You have to tell me where he went.

1028
01:31:45,772 --> 01:31:47,875
Please, tell me.

1029
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:50,177
Tell me!

1030
01:33:46,627 --> 01:33:48,896
Work, damn it!

1031
01:34:21,962 --> 01:34:24,264
- Josh?
- Susan!

1032
01:34:24,364 --> 01:34:27,401
You know, you don't walk out on somebody.

1033
01:34:28,435 --> 01:34:32,906
You don't just get up and leave and...
and walk out like that. You don't do that!

1034
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,409
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

1035
01:34:36,376 --> 01:34:39,980
I'm really sorry, but...
I didn't know what to do. I...

1036
01:34:40,113 --> 01:34:43,050
I didn't know what to say.

1037
01:35:01,602 --> 01:35:03,971
Oh, God!

1038
01:35:04,104 --> 01:35:06,406
You got your wish.

1039
01:35:07,441 --> 01:35:10,010
- I tried to tell you...
- I didn't listen.

1040
01:35:10,143 --> 01:35:12,845
- I guess I didn't hear you,...
- I tried to tell you.

1041
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:19,186
- ..or want to! Even if I did listen...
- I've been thinking about this. I've been...

1042
01:35:20,153 --> 01:35:25,459
There's a million reasons for me to go home,
but there's only one reason for me to stay.

1043
01:35:27,895 --> 01:35:30,797
What... What reason is that?

1044
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,768
Well...

1045
01:35:34,835 --> 01:35:36,937
..you!

1046
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:41,008
Oh, come on... Come on. Come on, come on!

1047
01:35:48,315 --> 01:35:51,118
So, uh... what are you? Fifteen? Sixteen?

1048
01:35:53,754 --> 01:35:56,657
Well... I'm thirteen.

1049
01:35:56,692 --> 01:35:58,759
Ohh...

1050
01:36:02,696 --> 01:36:04,998
Well, that explains it!

1051
01:36:16,677 --> 01:36:19,246
Maybe you could come with me.

1052
01:36:22,316 --> 01:36:24,818
No! Ha!

1053
01:36:24,885 --> 01:36:26,620
No...

1054
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:28,355
Why not?

1055
01:36:28,422 --> 01:36:31,158
I've... I've been there before.

1056
01:36:35,028 --> 01:36:37,598
It's hard enough the first time.

1057
01:36:38,999 --> 01:36:41,502
You know what I mean?

1058
01:36:42,736 --> 01:36:45,339
You don't know what I mean.

1059
01:36:54,281 --> 01:36:57,150
Come on, I'll drive you home.

1060
01:37:02,022 --> 01:37:05,459
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'll be OK.

1061
01:37:05,559 --> 01:37:07,761
You'll be fine.

1062
01:37:07,861 --> 01:37:10,364
In ten years, who knows?

1063
01:37:11,932 --> 01:37:14,868
Maybe you should hold onto my number.

1064
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:35,789
So this is where you live?

1065
01:37:37,257 --> 01:37:41,028
- Which one is it?
- That one right there, just...

1066
01:37:41,128 --> 01:37:44,064
Oh. That's nice.

1067
01:37:48,735 --> 01:37:51,737
I'm gonna miss you.

1068
01:37:51,772 --> 01:37:54,474
I'm gonna miss you, too.

1069
01:37:58,245 --> 01:38:01,782
- You won't even remember me.
- Oh, yes, I will.

1070
01:40:06,073 --> 01:40:08,175
Mom?

1071
01:40:08,976 --> 01:40:11,078
- Mom!
- Josh?

1072
01:40:11,113 --> 01:40:13,180
- It's me!
- Josh?

1073
01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:16,517
Josh! Oh, my God!

1074
01:40:16,583 --> 01:40:18,652
Oh, thank God you're home!

1075
01:40:18,785 --> 01:40:21,922
Oh, Mom... I missed you all so much.

1076
01:40:31,732 --> 01:40:35,033
- I'm just not good enough.
- What are you talking about?

1077
01:40:35,068 --> 01:40:38,405
You hit the ball over the fence
almost every time in stickball.

1078
01:40:38,472 --> 01:40:42,142
You just gotta get used to a fatter bat.

1079
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,579
- You really think I could do it?
- Yeah!

1080
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:50,284
- Come on, we'll hit some after supper.
- OK. I'll call for ya.
