<i>Let's fly way up
to the clouds</i>

7
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:41,275
<i>Away from
the maddening crowds</i>

8

peace of mind</i>

00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:51,535
<i>Let us leave the confusion</i>

11
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,122
<i>And all disillusion behind</i>

12
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:58,709

birds of a feather</i>

00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:02,504

14
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:06,133
<i>Volare</i>

15
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,011

<i>No wonder
my happy heart sings</i>

19
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:25,193
<i>Your love
has given me wings?</i>

20
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,243
Who is it?
- Room service.

21
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:18,997
Is it eggs?

22
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,416
I don't know, sir.
I didn't order it.

23
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,436
You want some
water with that?

24
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,938
No, no.
No, I don't.

25
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,065
Looks like you
had a night.

26
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:51,988
They look perfect.

27
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,532
Get out.

28
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:02,040
I intended to bring that
to the attention of a member of staff.

29
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,794
I had some difficulty
getting it to open.

30
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:09,131
It's the little key
on the door key, sir.

31
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,383
Right.

32
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,807
I was looking for
some nuts.

33
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,605
I tend to avoid alcohol.

34
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,278
When I can.

35
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:43,874
I don't speak Spanish.

36
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:11,943
Cuatro cincuenta.
No change.

37
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,066
No, no, no, no,
you're not listening.

38
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,235
I said the Pirates,
not the Yankees.

39
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,153
It's going to be
Roberto's year, I'm telling you.

40
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:56,822
Looking for Mr. Lotterman.

41
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,323
End of the room.

42
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:00,951
No, no, the Pirates.

43
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,577
You guys are going
to be all over.

44
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,204
It's Roberto
Clemente, man.

45
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:06,414
And by the way, I
want to talk about...

46
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:15,090
Not now!

47
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,844
He's having
the Friday crisis.

48
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,974
You Kemp?
Yeah.

49
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,643
He was expecting you
yesterday.

50
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,186
We had some weather.

51
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,396
Yeah, I heard.

52
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,189
Big snow in New York.

53
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,609
He's still on a call.
You want some coffee?

54
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,861
No, thanks.

55
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,237
What's all the fuss
out front?

56
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,780
You came
in the front?

57
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,116
We don't use that door.

58
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:43,493
Not when los jibaros
pitch up.

59
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:45,036
What do they want?

60
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:46,121
I don't know.

61
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,623
Some fucked idea
of a living wage.

62
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,585
They've been out there
on and off for months.

63
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,713
By the way,
my name's Sala.

64
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,756
Bob Sala,
staff photographer.

65
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,133
Pleased to meet you, Bob.

66
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,384
Yeah.

67
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,386
He's off.

68
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,806
You might want to try
another subservient knock.

69
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,308
Yeah.

70
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,519
Kemp.

71
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:11,521
Don't notice the wig.

72
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,194
Yeah. What?

73
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,208
If you're
who I think you are, you better sit down.

74
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,597
You find it
a little bright in here?

75
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,017
I'd take them off,
but I have a medical condition.

76
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,685
What do you mean,
you're blind?

77
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,854
Conjunctivitis, sir.

78
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,732
The old red eye, huh?

79
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:03,490
You arrive at a very,
very trying time, Mr. Kemp.

80
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:05,784
One of those days
stacking up.

81
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,953
So, uh, why don't we cut
through the niceties

82
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,496
and just get
right to it, huh?

83
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,289
That's how
I like to proceed.

84
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,041
Okay.
Your resume here.

85
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:19,214
Very impressive CV.

86
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:21,591
Yeah.

87
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,052
You worked your way up
some interesting titles.

88
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,139
I really like
the "fluent Spanish."

89
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,557
Mmm.
Wow.

90
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,022
This CV... This CV is
a bunch of bullshit.

91
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,400
Is it?

92
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,652
This is two days
on the wire.

93
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:43,321
A day dead.
We don't have it.

94
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,032
Oh.

95
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,703
What is the matter
with Moburg?

96
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:53,164
He's about as useful
as a dug-up body.

97
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:06,136
You see, the problem with
this newspaper, Mr. Kemp,

98
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,972
is that I am among many
who don't enjoy reading it.

99
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,349
We have
an ailing circulation,

100
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,059
and I just have to
look around this building

101
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,686
to understand why.

102
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,523
Lack of commitment and
too much self-indulgence.

103
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,400
Mmm. Mmm.

104
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,236
So what I'm looking for

105
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,363
is some enthusiasm,
some energy,

106
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,365
some fresh blood.

107
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,870
And the question
that I'm asking myself

108
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,164
is how much alcohol
is usual in yours.

109
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,832
My fresh blood?

110
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,208
How much do you drink?

111
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:40,086
I suppose at
the upper end of "social."

112
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,005
I'm poised to give up.

113
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,882
Well, Puerto Rico may not be

114
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,592
the best place on Earth
to do that.

115
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,094
Mmm. Mmm.

116
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,556
Don't look so
anxious, Mr. Kemp.

117
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,976
I wouldn't have paid
for your hotel if I hadn't already hired you.

118
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,103
But this is not
the Last Chance Saloon,

119
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:59,439
and I do not need
another heavy drinker.

120
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:02,400
Which I perceive,
from the condition of eyeballs behind glasses,

121
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,194
that you might
very well qualify as.

122
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:06,696
This is a medical
condition, Mr. Lotterman.

123
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,490
I know it might look
like something else, but this is a...

124
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,657
Looks like
a fuckin' hangover.

125
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,784
Does it?

126
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,501
Come here.

127
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:25,006
That's the kind of
commitment I like to see in a man.

128
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,927
Oh! Determination,
balanced with appropriate humanity.

129
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,262
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

130
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,850
Which side
do you dress, Kemp?

131
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,602
I beg your pardon?

132
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:38,978
Politics.

133
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,272
I kind of hang
in the middle.

134
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,362
This is a schizoid
society, Kemp.

135
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,657
They got two languages,
two flags, two loyalties, two anthems.

136
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:52,117
We bring them stuff
they never had.

137
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,618
They either hate it or
they want more of it.

138
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:55,120
It's a reluctant part
of America.

139
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,247
It's like an England
with tropical fruit.

140
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,623
Bob.

141
00:10:58,707 --> 00:10:59,999
Just the man
I wanted to see.

142
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,127
This is Paul Kemp.
He's joining us from New York.

143
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:03,461
Yeah, yeah,
we already met.

144
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:06,297
Uh, that's...
That's Mr. Clive Donovan, sports.

145
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:07,924
And this is
Mr. Hubert, accounting.

146
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,300
Listen, do me a favor,
will you?

147
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,802
Show him around,
the dos and don'ts.

148
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,220
Introduce him
to some of the guys.

149
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,471
I'll take him
up to Al's.

150
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,597
Oh, the hell you will.

151
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:15,723
You take him to
the library.

152
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,933
You pull out
some volumes.

153
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:18,268
I want him to get
a sense of the paper.

154
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,395
You know,
make some notes, go back a few years,

155
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,313
paying particular attention
to bowling alleys.

156
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,565
There's bowling and
bowling alleys.

157
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,066
Very big here.
They're up like mushrooms.

158
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,317
A new one premieres
every week.

159
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:27,819
Been to
Puerto Rico before? No.

160
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,279
Oh, you're going to
fall right into it.

161
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:31,364
There's a boom
on here, Kemp. It's an open door.

162
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:33,658
You play it right,
you can surf the place.

163
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:34,742
Ah.

164
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:37,620
What do you know
about horoscopes?

165
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:38,705
Nothing.

166
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:40,165
Ah, well, if I can
write one, you can.

167
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:43,334
So it's every day with
a special "Star's Star"

168
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,170
featured Saturday
with Betty Grable

169
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:47,130
and Neil Sedaka,
things like that.

170
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,924
So here,
everything you need is right there.

171
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,136
It's called
"Madam La Zonga Predicts."

172
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,470
What happened to
Madam La Zonga?

173
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,055
He got canceled.

174
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,223
What do you
mean, fired?

175
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:58,600
They raped him to death.

176
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,394
They raped him to death?

177
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,688
There are
very few places on this island

178
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,148
I decline to visit,

179
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:07,025
but the toilets
frequented by sailors

180
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:09,611
on the west side
of Candado Pier is one.

181
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,030
They raped him to death?

182
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,282
La Zonga died in a cubicle.

183
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:18,119
Say, you're not,
uh, artistic, are you, Kemp?

184
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:19,704
Oh, no.

185
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,290
You might want to
rethink those menthol cigarettes.

186
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,792
They don't do
a thing for you.

187
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:45,021
Come by the house.

188
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,189
I will.

189
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,068
I like your stuff.

190
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:52,695
The cuttings you sent
to Lotterman.

191
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,822
Oh.
It's good writing.

192
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,157
Thanks.

193
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:00,745
We'll talk.

194
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,749
One more floor!

195
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:09,420
They put in automated
packing machines about six months ago.

196
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:11,589
They mechanized
almost everything.

197
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:14,425
There used to be
50 guys down here. Now there's five.

198
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,177
Hence happiness
in the street.

199
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:19,555
Souvenir, day one.

200
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,476
Here's to pretty women
with filthy thoughts.

201
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:27,981
Want a burger?
No.

202
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,482
Burger?
No, thanks.

203
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,150
Try it. Dos.

204
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,195
So how was
the induction?

205
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:35,613
Somewhat fraught.

206
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,284
No disrespect, Paul,
but he didn't have a lot of choice.

207
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,703
You know how many people
applied for the job?

208
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,204
One. You.

209
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:44,455
Is that right?

210
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,666
Even then,
I thought I'd blown it.

211
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,126
Zeroed in on
my weakest spot.

212
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,627
Which is what?

213
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,296
Two and a half
unpublished novels

214
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,714
and references
of equal fiction.

215
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,215
Oh, you're
a novelist.

216
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:56,592
Mmm, in a manner
of speaking.

217
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,344
Can't even get read.

218
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,805
So I figured I'd do
some words for money,

219
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:02,223
see how it's looking
in a year or two.

220
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,599
At El Star?

221
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,893
Hate to tell you this
on the way in,

222
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,104
but this publication's
on its way out.

223
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:10,648
And as far as I'm concerned,
it can't come soon enough.

224
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,150
Not going to happen.

225
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,235
You like
a little vonga on that?

226
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,030
I'll give you 13 to 2
this thing's over by June.

227
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:18,364
They're going to
cut the cord.

228
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:20,033
Then why put in
all the new machinery?

229
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:22,493
Precisely my point,
and he can't answer it.

230
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,204
Well, like I'm tired
of arguing the obvious.

231
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,706
Come on.
Let's eat.

232
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,542
Now, I got to go
and see a man about a horse.

233
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,587
Good to meet you, Paul.

234
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,302
Another night unfolds
over Old San Juan.

235
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,471
You been here long?

236
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,056
Too long.

237
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,974
This place is like
someone you fucked

238
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,267
and they're still
under you.

239
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:47,852
Why don't you quit?

240
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:49,479
Life's full of exits.

241
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:52,648
Because I'm waiting
for it to collapse so I get the payoff.

242
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,610
Three grand redundancy
puts me in Mexico.

243
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,947
Don't look left.

244
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,784
That's an introduction
you don't want to have.

245
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,410
Who's he?

246
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:08,081
Living example
of everything that's wrong with this paper.

247
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:09,999
His name's Moburg.

248
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,669
Our Crime and
Religious Affairs correspondent.

249
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:16,297
Lotterman can't fire him
because he never sees him.

250
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,007
He's rarely out
in daylight.

251
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,592
Looks like
he enjoys a drink.

252
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:22,929
The entire substructure
of his brain is eaten away with rum.

253
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,432
I'm telling you,
this enterprise is doomed.

254
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:31,062
There's maybe three or four
professionals in the building running the entire show.

255
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,607
Wait a minute.
Who is Hal Sanderson?

256
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:37,235
In the library.
Who's he?

257
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,737
He used to work
for the paper.

258
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:43,116
Now he's what
he says he is. A PR consultant.

259
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,119
Selling this place
street by street to the Yankees.

260
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,997
Keeps a greasy little
bastard of a contact called Segurra.

261
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,249
Mmm.

262
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,917
I saw him.
We didn't meet.

263
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,335
Wouldn't bother.

264
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,837
Piss on the make.

265
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,798
The boy, Segurra,
is at the property wickedness.

266
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,676
I'm not sure
where Sanderson fits.

267
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,053
But Sanderson's
worth cultivation.

268
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:05,263
He's got some
good connections.

269
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:07,056
He's good for
some freelance.

270
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:12,186
This place is depressing me
beyond belief tonight.

271
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:14,397
You're at
Plage Xanadu, right?

272
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:15,606
Mmm.

273
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,275
Come on.
I'll give you a ride.

274
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:38,212
I was thinking,
if you need somewhere,

275
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,047
I got a room for rent.

276
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,885
Not the best address
in town, but it's got a fridge and TV.

277
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,261
60 a month.

278
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:47,555
Sounds inviting.
I might remention that.

279
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,390
Meanwhile,
bleed it dry.

280
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:01,235
Uh, sir...

281
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:03,613
I was hoping for a swim.

282
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:05,239
The pool is
closed tonight.

283
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,158
Really? Why?
What's going on?

284
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,577
It's a Union Carbide party.

285
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,078
It's a private function.

286
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:02,296
Sorry.

287
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,507
I didn't realize
anyone was there.

288
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:06,717
I thought
it was just floating.

289
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,970
It is just floating.

290
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,430
You doing
what I'm doing?

291
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,975
I don't think so.

292
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,685
What are you doing?

293
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,145
Escaping
the dreadful party.

294
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:20,773
I just snuck out
and unzipped.

295
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,026
Well, that's very
courageous of you.

296
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,071
I thought maybe
you were a mermaid.

297
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,240
They tell me the coast
is infested with them.

298
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,992
I'm from Connecticut.

299
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:33,828
My boyfriend's
making a speech.

300
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:36,163
Takes exactly 21 minutes.

301
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,415
Well, then I guess
it's pointless,

302
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:39,375
me inviting you for a drink.

303
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,085
What you got?

304
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:42,920
No, I mean at the bar.

305
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,258
Pointless.

306
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:50,845
I'd better go before
they wonder where I went.

307
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,099
Wait a minute.
What's your name?

308
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,560
Let's keep that a secret.

309
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,270
I don't even know it.

310
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,022
Well, then you'll
keep it even better.

311
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,607
What about your star sign?

312
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,775
I'm an experienced
astronomer.

313
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,028
Could try Pisces.

314
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,738
The fish.

315
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,450
Oh, God.

316
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:14,702
Why did she
have to happen?

317
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:17,913
Just when I was doing
so good without her.

318
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,500
What would you say you
like most about Puerto Rico?

319
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:24,253
The bowling alleys
and the casinos.

320
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,339
Course, she likes
the duty free.

321
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:28,591
Well, the more you spend,
the more you save.

322
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:30,426
Have you seen
a lot of the island?

323
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,928
We don't leave the hotel.

324
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,764
It isn't safe.

325
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:35,848
But
you're having fun?

326
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:38,559
Oh, yeah!
A lotta, lotta fun!

327
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:42,480
Have some fun
with a fucking Luger.

328
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,316
These alleys are magnets
to the glutton.

329
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,069
They come off the boats
like locusts.

330
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,239
Beasts of obesity.

331
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,784
Asses that wouldn't
feel an arrow.

332
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,412
The great whites.

333
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,290
Probably the most dangerous
creatures on Earth.

334
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:14,845
There's your baby.

335
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,138
Walt and his woman.

336
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,016
Bowling alleys
isn't exactly what I had in mind.

337
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,685
Tread it till
the snow melts,

338
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:22,186
then join the exodus.

339
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:24,605
Red light!

340
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,190
Looking for Kemp.

341
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,528
Too many adjectives,
too much cynicism.

342
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:32,363
Nobody wants what's
wrong with the place,

343
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:33,906
they want to read about
what's right.

344
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,533
It's a rewrite.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

345
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,284
And while you're at it,

346
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,370
you might want to rewrite
the title and call it

347
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,664
"Ten Things That I Love
About Puerto Rico."

348
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,129
So,

349
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,756
how's the sobriety
coming along?

350
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,050
I'm cutting down.

351
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:56,429
Oh. By that,
I assume you mean the size of the bottles.

352
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:02,309
How does anybody
drink 161 miniatures?

353
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,229
You're averaging
93 miniatures a week.

354
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:07,398
What, do they
stock the place four times a day?

355
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,649
Are they not
complimentary?

356
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,067
No, Mr. Kemp,
they are not.

357
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:12,361
And neither is wine
and long-distance phone calls.

358
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:16,198
So, as of Monday,
you are no longer a resident of the Xanadu.

359
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,451
And what exactly
brings you into the building?

360
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:19,577
Don't hazel me.

361
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,455
I got the X-rays back.
I got less than a week to live.

362
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:25,082
Hazel you?
What are you talking about, you Swedish twerp?

363
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:28,335
You know,
it may have crossed what's left of your mind

364
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,962
that I have
a newspaper to run here,

365
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:32,965
that we have
something called news going on out there.

366
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:34,592
But as far as
you're concerned,

367
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:37,011
I might as well look out
of the fuckin' window!

368
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:38,929
What are you
doing here?

369
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,097
This is a newspaper.

370
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:41,265
There's nothing
here for you.

371
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,225
Two of the best scoops
you ever had

372
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,894
came out of my brain.

373
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:46,854
And you better
moderate your language

374
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,147
or I'll go elsewhere.

375
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:49,356
Elsewhere where?

376
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,358
You couldn't get work
as a fly repellent.

377
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:53,110
You're worthless, Moburg.

378
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,112
The last onion
in the jar.

379
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,323
Don't push me, Lotterman.

380
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:58,783
I'm dangerous when pushed.

381
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,493
Oh, I know why
you're here.

382
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:02,036
It's payday.

383
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
But in your case,

384
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:04,455
deferred on
a permanent basis.

385
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:05,623
You're fired!

386
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:07,124
You can't fire me.

387
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,542
You owe me money.

388
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,128
And you better pay it,
or I'll come through the roof

389
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,506
and turn this place
into an insurance claim.

390
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,924
Are you threatening me?

391
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,342
Hey, guys,
let's take it easy.

392
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:18,260
You want to
suffer some voodoo?

393
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:19,512
You twerp!

394
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:21,388
Eat the death pill, Lotterman!

395
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,183
Come on,
we're walking.

396
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,227
Did you hear
what he said to me?

397
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,978
This guy's
my blood pressure.

398
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,563
This guy's
going to kill me.

399
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,359
And I want the negative
of that picture destroyed!

400
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,196
I don't want that animal
in this building again.

401
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,989
He is hygienically
unacceptable.

402
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,033
Did you see the side
of his nose?

403
00:22:41,117 --> 00:22:42,535
Blackheads
like Braille.

404
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,453
They should have him
put down.

405
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:47,665
Moburg is history.

406
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:49,917
He's out of here
at the earliest opportunity.

407
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:53,879
And the earliest
opportunity

408
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,174
is you.

409
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,927
You understand
what I'm saying, Kemp?

410
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,846
I think I get
the drift.

411
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,098
I want you to
immerse yourself into this paper,

412
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,350
'cause you got
the talent and I think you got the will.

413
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,686
You make it grow
and you grow right along with it.

414
00:23:09,813 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm not best placed
to do that.

415
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,274
You think
it's my intention to keep you on

416
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,984
horoscopes and rewrites
and bowling alleys?

417
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:19,154
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna move you right now.

418
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,367
Take a cab to
the airport.

419
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:25,786
The mayor of Miami's
coming in.

420
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,497
Make him sound nice.

421
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,875
I want a picture
and an interview.

422
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,293
Make it work, Paul.

423
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,981
You leaving
us already?

424
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,985
I'm moving into
an apartment if this mayor guy ever shows up.

425
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:01,322
They keep changing
"delayed" to "delayed."

426
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,828
You want to have
some breakfast?

427
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:09,288
Little lobster
on the beach?

428
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,290
Twenty minutes away.

429
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:13,000
Sounds inviting,
but I got to wait for the mayor.

430
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,752
Isn't coming.

431
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:15,878
Canceled.

432
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:18,130
That's not what it
says on the board.

433
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:19,673
It will in a minute.

434
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,883
I just called Miami.

435
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,302
Come on, let's have
some breakfast.

436
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,888
I got a couple things
might interest you.

437
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:29,016
I better call in.

438
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,143
You can call
from the car.

439
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:43,113
All right.
Yeah, thanks.

440
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:49,453
There's only
two of those on the island.

441
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:51,538
Maybe three.

442
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,667
No one told me it
was so pretty here.

443
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,711
God's idea of money.

444
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,467
You know what makes
this place a gold mine?

445
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,136
Something that
doesn't exist.

446
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,262
How's that?

447
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:08,639
Land.

448
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,557
There isn't enough of it.

449
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:15,270
Those who know how to
get it get the gold.

450
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,105
Chenault?

451
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:06,280
Paul's joining us
for breakfast.

452
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:08,949
Looks like
it's gonna be a lunch.

453
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,744
This is Chenault.

454
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,332
You two know
each other?

455
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,960
I don't know,
I thought maybe we met on the plane.

456
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:21,420
Oh, I don't
think so.

457
00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:23,088
I flew
Boyfriend Airlines.

458
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:25,674
Tell me, do you
like lobster, Paul?

459
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:27,551
You know what,
I might not have time today.

460
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:29,720
I didn't realize the drive
was gonna take so long.

461
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:30,804
How much time you got?

462
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,639
In 15 minutes,
I'm late.

463
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,558
I'll cut up
a pineapple.

464
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:37,102
You might want
to put on some clothes.

465
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:40,647
She sunbathes
in the nude.

466
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,483
A few of
the over-tanned locals

467
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,902
tend to treat it
as a tourist attraction.

468
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,403
Doesn't surprise me.

469
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:48,864
I mean that in a...
In a very tasteful way.

470
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:50,407
It's a private beach.

471
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:51,742
They shouldn't be here.

472
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,161
Sit down, Paul, sit down.
We'll grab you a cab.

473
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:59,708
His name's Harry.

474
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,169
Got the idea
from a book.

475
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,297
Paul, I wanted to talk,

476
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:08,217
because I'm looking
for someone who can

477
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:12,346
assimilate contradictory
points of view

478
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,139
and make them
into one voice.

479
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,100
You're a novelist, right?

480
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,768
Who told you that?

481
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:20,145
Oh, please.
Newspapers are full of gossip.

482
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:23,273
I'm looking for someone
who's good with words, next day, you turn up.

483
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:24,650
And 'cause I believe
in good luck,

484
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,276
I thought maybe
you were it.

485
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:28,070
What I need

486
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,240
is someone with
the right kind of eyes.

487
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,742
For looking at what?

488
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:36,203
Looking at that.

489
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,084
An ocean of money.

490
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:56,640
Hey, you made it.

491
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:58,642
Door at the end.

492
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:01,645
Hey.
Hey.

493
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:04,731
Hey. Just give me
two minutes.

494
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,608
Walk right in.

495
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:07,901
All right.

496
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:15,385
I was trying to
get the place shipshape before you arrived.

497
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:16,887
Adolf Hitler Speaks?

498
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:19,640
Not mine.
Nazi stuff belongs to Moburg.

499
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:21,183
Moburg lives here?

500
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,685
He keeps his uniform here.

501
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,271
I never see him
from one month's end to the next.

502
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,777
So, you can see,
it's quite spacious.

503
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,071
Don't look in
the kitchen.

504
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:36,156
The water's off.
There's a problem with the valve.

505
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:38,909
Thought you said
you had a TV.

506
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,994
I said I kind of
have a TV.

507
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,502
The guy across the alley
has a TV, I have binoculars.

508
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:50,087
His wife's deaf.

509
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,464
With the window open,
you hear every word.

510
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,675
Oh, here it comes.

511
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,134
Water's coming up.

512
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,804
I, uh, noticed
you had some chickens in the bedroom.

513
00:29:58,888 --> 00:29:59,930
Cockerels.

514
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,265
Yeah, I'm sweating
the grease out.

515
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:03,433
Don't worry about them,
I'm moving them to my room.

516
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:04,601
What do you
do with them?

517
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:05,852
You eat them?
Eat them?

518
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,022
Nah.
I don't eat them.

519
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,333
Come on, baby, come on!

520
00:30:28,418 --> 00:30:30,168
Get in there,
get in there!

521
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:31,295
Come on!

522
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:49,938
Hey, on a trade wind,
my boy! On a trade wind!

523
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,231
Come on, bump it up,
there, Bobby.

524
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,608
Bump, bump,
bump, bump. Yes, sir!

525
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:23,323
Hey. They call him
El Monstruo.

526
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,992
Say he's never lost
a fight in three years.

527
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:29,663
Come on,
we're out of here.

528
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,793
Come on,
rapido, rapido.

529
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:38,922
Hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

530
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:41,007
Come on.
Come on. Go on.

531
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,700
I tell you, we were
on a roll til that thing turned up.

532
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,661
That's $217.

533
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:10,954
Not bad.

534
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:12,873
$217 is
a shitload of money.

535
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,207
Relatively a shitload.

536
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,168
They're expensive
to train.

537
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:19,463
I've seen guys win 2,000,
ten on North Beach.

538
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:21,047
10,000?

539
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,175
Why didn't he take
El Monstruo down there?

540
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:26,386
You're talking
the environs of the Hilton Hotel.

541
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,472
They wear bowties
and shiny shoes.

542
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:30,390
There's no hope for
his kind of hat.

543
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,313
The question, again,
is not one of goals.

544
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:37,439
We're for those goals.

545
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:38,565
It's one of means.

546
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,734
Were you claiming
that the Eisenhower administration...

547
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:44,571
How long can
this blizzard of shame go on?

548
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:48,617
Look at this ingrate
besotted with his own righteousness.

549
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:51,828
Black is a very dark
shade of white.

550
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,914
Well, thank you
very much, Mr. Nixon.

551
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,209
I can't listen to
any more of this.

552
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,585
Lies like he breathes.

553
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,922
Imagine spending
your entire life lying.

554
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,548
Holy Christ.

555
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,884
Never got worse.

556
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:11,139
The only eventuality
worse than him is you know that one day,

557
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:14,017
some filthy whore-beast
is gonna show up,

558
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:15,727
make him look
like a liberal.

559
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,105
The only upside
with Nixon is he ain't gonna win.

560
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:20,941
He's got the grin.

561
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,192
He ain't gonna win.

562
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:23,818
Irish guy's
going to win.

563
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:25,695
But they'll never
let him live.

564
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,406
How do you know that?

565
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:30,450
I do "horror-scopes."

566
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,372
Thought you said
he never came here.

567
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:37,874
He's got filters.

568
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,167
What filters?

569
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,088
He goes over the wall
at the Barcardi plant.

570
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:47,717
These filters
are the last in line in the distillation process.

571
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:52,013
They contain more ethanol
than rocket fuel.

572
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:53,139
What's it like?

573
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:54,891
A hand on the brain.

574
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:56,643
Off the scale.

575
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,395
470 proof.

576
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,438
No such thing
as 470 proof alcohol.

577
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,779
Certainty you might be
required to moderate.

578
00:35:09,282 --> 00:35:10,407
Ah.

579
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:13,410
No smoking
in the extraction area, if you please.

580
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:14,828
Don't be ridiculous.

581
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,426
Not for the social drinker.

582
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,679
You want to quaff?

583
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:33,930
No.

584
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:35,765
Not right now.
I got to write.

585
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,975
I got a deadline.

586
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:38,852
Oh, what's he writing?

587
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:41,813
He's lifting the stone
on the American Dream.

588
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:43,064
Guayanilla Bay.

589
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,567
Oh, yeah.
It's bad down there.

590
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,487
You might find such
a topic attracts a limited readership.

591
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:50,989
Only need one.

592
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:52,866
Taking it to Lotterman.

593
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:55,785
Yeah. Oh, did
I hear somebody say "good luck"?

594
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:59,914
Yeah, I went down
there this morning,

595
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:04,377
he unfired me
on a temporary basis, maggot that he is.

596
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:07,047
I'd like to
bring something in to Lotterman.

597
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:10,592
Like a slide-action,
"fuck you" gun.

598
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:13,553
Don't drink
that here.

599
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,974
Just a nipperoo,
old boy.

600
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,726
Quality test.

601
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:24,981
Man, slow-motion murder,
just like they do in the movies.

602
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,026
See him flying back,

603
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,779
fuckin' arms
flapping in the air.

604
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:33,073
Okay, mother.

605
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,368
Look upon the last
face you'll see this side of hell!

606
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:37,661
Bam!

607
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:41,498
Down he goes,
morsels of vital organs

608
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:44,292
spinning off
into flesh orbit.

609
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:45,627
Bam!

610
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:47,754
There goes
his asshole.

611
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:48,838
Bam!

612
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:50,715
There goes
his dick.

613
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,717
Bam! Bam!

614
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,011
Fuck you, Lotterman!

615
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:58,932
You're in a B-fucking movie,
and I am the death machine!

616
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:03,895
Shall we have
some Adolf?

617
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,188
Definitely not.

618
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,482
On your way,
on your way, Moburg.

619
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,275
Hey, we're
expecting guests.

620
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,319
I thought you said
he was writing a book.

621
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:12,570
Said I was
writing an essay.

622
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:14,698
And it requires
some shut mouth.

623
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:17,867
Oh, don't waste
your time on those junkyard losers.

624
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:21,204
This country was
built on genocide and slavery.

625
00:37:21,288 --> 00:37:23,331
We killed
all the black guys that were here,

626
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,668
and then
we shipped in new black guys of our own,

627
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:29,045
and then we
brought in Jesus, like a bar of soap.

628
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,213
Let's go.

629
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:31,589
You know it.

630
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:33,842
I am the religious
correspondent.

631
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:36,845
Fuck off with
your Jesus Police!

632
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:39,848
If the Bible's God's
book, why didn't He give it to everyone?

633
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:47,814
"We give more money
to parking meters than we do to kids to eat."

634
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,316
Don't read me like that.
I've done the research.

635
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,111
12,000-ton rust bucket
went down in the bay

636
00:37:53,195 --> 00:37:55,196
full of hydrochloric acid.

637
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:56,698
Killed off
everything in the sea.

638
00:37:56,782 --> 00:37:58,992
Killed off the fishermen.
Their kids are picking garbage.

639
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,452
All right,
don't get angry.

640
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:01,745
It's hot outside.

641
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:04,038
You want a Scotch?

642
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:05,206
Yeah.

643
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:09,836
Ten years ago...
Five. Five years ago,

644
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,880
I might have said
go after it.

645
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,549
Now I say go with it.

646
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:16,593
There's nothing
you can change.

647
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:20,597
Sometimes you just
got to spew over the side and keep rowing.

648
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:23,892
Into a nut
brown sunset.

649
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,770
It's the land of
multiple outrage.

650
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:30,356
Thousands trodden on
before you wake up for breakfast.

651
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:33,860
That isn't news,
it's a commercial reality.

652
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,529
And providing it
isn't their sunset,

653
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,449
nobody gives
one-fifth of a fuck.

654
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:41,367
You underestimate
your readers.

655
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,494
I don't think so.

656
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:44,287
You underestimate me.

657
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:46,956
You told me to make it work,
that's what I want to do.

658
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,459
Wind down this La Zonga crap
and make a newspaper.

659
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:51,127
Let me tell you
some home truth.

660
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:54,422
This paper's been
on its knees to a bank since the day it opened.

661
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:56,633
And like most every other
newspaper on Earth,

662
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:58,134
it's financed
by its advertising.

663
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,428
And without advertising,
not only is there no La Zonga,

664
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,388
there's no paper
to put it in, so, thus,

665
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,766
there are one or two things
that we don't write about.

666
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:06,559
In other words,
nothing at all.

667
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,645
In one other word,
discretion.

668
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,480
You're not
a foreign correspondent

669
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:13,817
in some far-flung
foreign land, this is America.

670
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,193
This is Puerto Rico.

671
00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:17,654
This is America.

672
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,989
You think some plumber
from Normal, Illinois,

673
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:23,034
saves up for 25 years
to come here on a cruise ship

674
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:25,662
to read about bad times
in the sugar plantation?

675
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:27,664
They don't give a fuck!

676
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:29,332
The average guy
don't rock the boat,

677
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,125
'cause he wants
to climb aboard it.

678
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,878
And our readership
is vividly average.

679
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:38,341
They don't care
who the losers are.

680
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:41,219
They want
to know who won.

681
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:42,512
Who won the bowls,

682
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:45,682
who won the races,
who won the pot at the slot machines.

683
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,061
Look at me, Kemp.

684
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:52,814
You're not sleeping,
you're wide awake.

685
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,400
And this is
the American Dream.

686
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:59,821
So many hotels,
you can't see the sea.

687
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:02,073
You can see the sea
by checking into the hotels.

688
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:03,366
Pay to see the sea?

689
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:05,243
What's the matter
with that?

690
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:07,120
You're paying to be
in the dream.

691
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:10,373
There's a thin
veneer, Kemp,

692
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:12,292
between the dream
and the reality.

693
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:16,087
You wake them up
and the people might start asking for their money back.

694
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,053
You're the boss.

695
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:26,973
Not quite.

696
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,644
The editorial policy
of this newspaper is owned by the dream.

697
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,196
Oh, God.

698
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,329
Oh, Christ.

699
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:39,754
Oh, God, look at that.

700
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:42,966
Oh, God!

701
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,760
Hal?
Oh.

702
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,637
No, no,
I'm a friend of Hal's.

703
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:49,806
I was looking at his boat.

704
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,474
She's a sweet
little beauty.

705
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:52,892
You been aboard?

706
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,143
No.

707
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:55,645
Great little
island hopper.

708
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:57,563
We've all been
down on her.

709
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,607
It's a wonderful
experience.

710
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,281
You two are early.

711
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:08,408
Oh, you got lucky.

712
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,617
Yeah.

713
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,910
Did you meet?

714
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,620
Oh, yeah,
we got first names.

715
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:16,708
Art Zimburger, late of
the U.S. Marines, great friend of mine.

716
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:19,335
This is Mr. Paul Kemp,
New York Times.

717
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,670
Oh, you're the writer.

718
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:22,130
Paul's a novelist.
Uh-huh.

719
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:26,300
New York Times?

720
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:28,302
He don't know one
from the other.

721
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:30,346
Just go with it.
This guy's key.

722
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:31,764
Key to what?

723
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,642
Key to the discussion
we're about to have.

724
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,981
Look at those mothers.

725
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,984
Come with me, Kemp.

726
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,821
This is a private beach.

727
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:48,114
We are not on it.

728
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,949
No, but we are!

729
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,951
And what we do is private!

730
00:42:53,328 --> 00:42:55,038
Now get the fuck gone!

731
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,834
Get the fuck out of here!

732
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:01,377
I see your face again,

733
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:02,879
you're gonna have
a 12-gauge shotgun

734
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:04,422
telling you what to do.

735
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,600
Talking about Satan...

736
00:43:15,684 --> 00:43:19,187
If there ever was
a kingdom of Satan, the Soviet Union is it.

737
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,316
The only way to come
to terms with Communism is to destroy it.

738
00:43:24,026 --> 00:43:28,237
Hit it before it hits us
in a devastating democratic strike.

739
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:29,906
No more for
the major.

740
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:33,493
They're looking for a man
to push that button,

741
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:35,244
I am that man.

742
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:37,330
Yes, you are, honey.

743
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,583
You look ravishing,
Chenault.

744
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:41,918
Thank you.

745
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,044
You need rescuing?

746
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:44,545
Oh, don't
take him away.

747
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,255
He's very
entertaining.

748
00:43:47,382 --> 00:43:51,761
We were discussing Cuba and,
I don't know, we kind of veered off, didn't we?

749
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:54,222
Paul presents us
with a somewhat liberal point of view.

750
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:55,973
There is no such thing
as a liberal.

751
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:59,727
A liberal is a Commie
with a college education thinking Negro thoughts.

752
00:43:59,812 --> 00:44:01,938
Well, here's a fact
for you.

753
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:06,526
76.4 % of all Negroes
are controlled from Moscow.

754
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,529
That's why Castro gets
such an easy ride.

755
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,490
In my view,
we ought to bomb Cuba off the face of the Earth,

756
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:13,950
let its people
live in peace. Art.

757
00:44:14,034 --> 00:44:16,285
Hey.
Come on, let's eat.

758
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,745
Come on.

759
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:23,876
Who's the guy
in the shades?

760
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,795
Segurra's Daddy.

761
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:27,296
It's who you're waiting for.

762
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:28,464
Oh.

763
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:31,050
Thank you for my roses.

764
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,178
I didn't think you noticed.

765
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:35,888
Of course I noticed.

766
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,644
Paul, would you mind
joining us?

767
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:45,690
Oh.

768
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:48,985
How do you do, sir?

769
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:50,278
Mr. Kemp.
Nice to see you.

770
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:51,445
Mr. Kemp.

771
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:55,283
Okay.

772
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:56,659
Let me just start
by saying

773
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:58,202
this is a purely
informal meeting.

774
00:44:58,287 --> 00:45:01,622
And, incidentally,
you don't worry about Lotterman, okay?

775
00:45:01,707 --> 00:45:02,874
Lotterman?

776
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,251
What the hell's Lotterman
got to do with The New York Times?

777
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,336
Mr. Kemp subs for
a variety of newspapers.

778
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:08,838
Occasionally, he writes
for the news.

779
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:11,048
What he does
in his spare time is his affair.

780
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:12,466
That's how I like it.

781
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,093
We'd like you to do
some writing for us.

782
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,344
So I gather.

783
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:16,721
About what?

784
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:19,056
In a sentence,
we want to set something up,

785
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:21,225
and have the public
as our friends.

786
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,644
And there are a variety
of ways we can do that.

787
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:27,690
Let me tell you
how this kind

788
00:45:27,774 --> 00:45:29,066
of thing works, Paul.

789
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:30,985
Suppose, by way of example,

790
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:33,362
you wanted to put up taxes
by five percent.

791
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,031
The smart way of doing it

792
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,783
is to float the idea
of a ten percent hike.

793
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,494
Let them all shout about it,
get themselves in a fuss,

794
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:41,829
then you offer concessions.

795
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:43,873
"How about seven percent?"
"No way," they'll say.

796
00:45:43,957 --> 00:45:49,378
"All right, let's
stay friends and make a compromise at five."

797
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:50,463
Bingo.

798
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,881
They think
they won something,

799
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:54,133
you get the five percent
you wanted in the first place.

800
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,052
Same thing applies
to real estate.

801
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,221
You want to build
five houses,

802
00:45:58,305 --> 00:46:00,806
you put in a planning
application for 50.

803
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:02,725
How many do you
want to build?

804
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:03,976
None.

805
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:05,770
We want to
build one hotel.

806
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,605
Well, looking
around this place,

807
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:09,482
I don't think
anyone would notice.

808
00:46:09,816 --> 00:46:11,108
It isn't in this place.

809
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:12,401
It's an island.

810
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:16,113
Sensitive for a variety
of reasons we don't want to get into now.

811
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,033
Nobody wants a paradise
choked with hotels, but

812
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:22,328
everybody will be pleased
to compromise at one.

813
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:24,413
This is going to require
some clever writing

814
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:26,332
in various
carefully placed articles.

815
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:29,126
Isn't that
kind of thing illegal?

816
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:30,670
If I may say, Mr. Kemp,

817
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:33,422
that's an
inappropriate comment.

818
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:35,633
Where's the island?

819
00:46:35,717 --> 00:46:36,759
Can't tell you.

820
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:37,927
Not yet.

821
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:40,596
Discretion is paramount,
Mr. Kemp.

822
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:43,057
If you want to join us,
you'll have to sign some papers.

823
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:45,935
We're having a meeting
tomorrow in Hal's office.

824
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,186
If you want to be
part of what will be

825
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,189
a very exciting project,
come along.

826
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:53,025
There's a man outside
in a funny little car for Paul.

827
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,110
Oh, yeah.

828
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:55,528
Gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me.

829
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,113
I have to run.

830
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:04,453
Can't stay?

831
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:07,039
I hear the mermaids
come out in the moonlight.

832
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:16,590
From the moment we met,
I knew

833
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:19,010
there was going to be
something between us.

834
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:20,761
It's called her fiance.

835
00:47:20,846 --> 00:47:24,640
God, I'm so hopelessly
and progressively in love.

836
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:26,892
Do not confuse
love with lust,

837
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,811
nor drunkenness
with judgment.

838
00:47:30,022 --> 00:47:31,063
You want my advice?

839
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,773
No. If it involves her,
no, I don't.

840
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:34,233
Stay away from her.

841
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:35,651
And stay away
from Sanderson.

842
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:36,944
You're way
out of depth.

843
00:47:37,029 --> 00:47:39,947
I got no brief for Sanderson
or his pissy rip-off island.

844
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:43,326
I just want some
apple blossom lipstick and fucks.

845
00:47:43,535 --> 00:47:45,328
You are in total denial.

846
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:46,620
She's fucking
someone else.

847
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:48,331
Oh!
And as I understand it,

848
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:49,832
about to be
married to him.

849
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,459
La-la-la-la-la-la!

850
00:47:51,543 --> 00:47:52,835
You won't even
make an invite.

851
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:56,297
I don't believe this.

852
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:58,632
We're right back
where we started.

853
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:01,302
That is the same
Cabrones we passed

854
00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:02,762
ten minutes ago.

855
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,564
We need directions.

856
00:48:14,608 --> 00:48:16,776
Let's get in there and
get something to eat.

857
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:21,238
No.

858
00:48:21,323 --> 00:48:22,573
Please, no.

859
00:48:22,657 --> 00:48:24,533
I haven't spent
all day on a beach

860
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:26,577
munching lobster
with criminals,

861
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:27,870
and I'm starving.

862
00:49:06,535 --> 00:49:09,662
Two beers, two rums,
one steak.

863
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,788
The kitchen is closed.

864
00:49:10,872 --> 00:49:12,540
All right then,
two beers and two rums.

865
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:14,208
And one steak.

866
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,709
Cerrado,
Mister...

867
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:18,045
Yeah, but let's not
bother me with that.

868
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:23,175
You got a sign down there
saying, "Food til midnight," and I want a steak.

869
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,515
Girl of the swamp.

870
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,518
Which reminds me,
we need a map.

871
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:34,145
You know
what I think?

872
00:49:35,063 --> 00:49:36,981
I think we're drinking
too much rum.

873
00:49:37,149 --> 00:49:38,441
There's no other way.

874
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:42,778
I'm getting double ashtray
and double salt pot.

875
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:46,240
You got a Moburg bifocal.

876
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:48,367
Christ, this is heinous.

877
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:51,287
Imagine what it must be like
to be an alcoholic.

878
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:53,372
$2.

879
00:49:53,915 --> 00:49:56,000
You pay and you go.

880
00:49:56,376 --> 00:49:57,793
I don't see a steak.

881
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,712
No steak.

882
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,255
What do you mean,
no steak?

883
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:03,466
I think he means no steak.

884
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:06,177
The kitchen is closed.

885
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:07,928
I got no way
of serving you.

886
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:11,474
Listen, you don't want
to hear about my bad day,

887
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:14,018
and I don't want
no grave side out of you.

888
00:50:14,102 --> 00:50:17,146
If you can't cook it,
bring it like it is. I'll eat it raw.

889
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,107
Two dollars,
you pay and go.

890
00:50:20,192 --> 00:50:21,609
Don't bother me.

891
00:50:21,693 --> 00:50:24,236
You pay now,
or I call the cops.

892
00:50:24,738 --> 00:50:27,448
If you have no intention
of serving me steak,

893
00:50:27,532 --> 00:50:29,909
why don't you do
your best to fuck off.

894
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:48,928
It seems to me there's
a bad vibe developing.

895
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,264
There are one or two oddities
giving us the eye.

896
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:53,891
Don't get paranoid.

897
00:50:53,975 --> 00:50:55,351
He's on the phone.

898
00:50:55,477 --> 00:50:56,519
For what?

899
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:57,853
Ordering food
in a restaurant?

900
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:00,105
Let's hope
he's through to the FBI.

901
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,315
Si, la policia?

902
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,320
What's the matter?

903
00:51:06,655 --> 00:51:08,197
What are you smiling at?

904
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:10,199
I'm not smiling.

905
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:12,409
I'm maintaining
a casual face.

906
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:17,915
A man just walked in

907
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:21,752
and has good reason
for regarding us in a negative light.

908
00:51:21,836 --> 00:51:23,128
Us?
Me.

909
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:25,047
And he's just seen me.

910
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:28,008
And he wants revenge
on the white man.

911
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,928
The fuck are you
talking about?

912
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,931
How about the one
with the dent?

913
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:38,018
The one with the eye?

914
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:39,186
The very same.

915
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,314
Do we walk or run?

916
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,316
Walk.

917
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,818
I'll push the car.

918
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,995
Let's walk and
hope he's happy.

919
00:52:10,677 --> 00:52:12,469
Hey, Yankee.

920
00:52:12,554 --> 00:52:13,929
Yankee!

921
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:36,160
Don't let me
see headlights.

922
00:52:37,537 --> 00:52:39,330
Please don't let me
see headlights.

923
00:52:41,082 --> 00:52:42,666
I just seen
headlights.

924
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:44,918
Put your foot down.

925
00:52:45,003 --> 00:52:46,879
Where exactly do
you think I got it?

926
00:52:57,057 --> 00:52:58,557
Can you go faster?

927
00:52:58,642 --> 00:52:59,892
Going fast as I can.

928
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,623
Jesus Christ, man.

929
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:47,606
We're gonna be killed!
We're gonna be killed!

930
00:53:52,904 --> 00:53:54,154
Hey!

931
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,869
Get ready to run.

932
00:54:00,954 --> 00:54:02,162
Run in
opposite directions.

933
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:03,247
Give me the brew!

934
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:04,415
Give me the fucking brew!

935
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:25,185
Paul!

936
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:51,378
Piece of luck.
I just saw Moburg.

937
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:53,464
At least I think
he saw us.

938
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:58,343
They got some kind of
night court going.

939
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,610
He says
we were animals

940
00:55:14,694 --> 00:55:17,905
on a rampage
of drunken anarchy,

941
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:20,115
poured gasoline
on one of his cops.

942
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:27,831
Oh, my God,
we're doomed.

943
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,625
You have
something to say?

944
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,378
Yes, Your Honor,
I do.

945
00:55:34,214 --> 00:55:38,675
Firstly, this guy
handcuffed to me, I never seen in my life.

946
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:43,388
And second,
we'd like a translation of the charges.

947
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,765
You heard
what they said?

948
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:48,268
With respect,
I heard people speaking Spanish.

949
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:52,231
What kind of language
do you think we speak in this country, Mister?

950
00:55:58,863 --> 00:55:59,905
He's not with us.

951
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,741
The cops attached him
to get a conviction.

952
00:56:03,701 --> 00:56:06,453
Did you leave
the Cafe Cabrones without paying?

953
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,500
Did you set fire
to the police officer, yes or no?

954
00:56:11,584 --> 00:56:13,836
Unfortunately, Your Honor,
he got in the way of our flame.

955
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,128
That's right.

956
00:56:15,213 --> 00:56:18,423
No way did we pour
gasoline on his head and laugh as we did.

957
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:20,676
It wasn't like he said.

958
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,135
Like he said?

959
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:24,346
Like you say
you don't speak Spanish.

960
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,306
Mr. Kemp doesn't
speak Spanish.

961
00:56:26,391 --> 00:56:28,600
Well, he will
have plenty of opportunity to learn.

962
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,435
The charges against you
are grave.

963
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,981
Resisting arrest
carries a tariff alone of one year in prison.

964
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:36,316
Never mind assault
with a deadly weapon.

965
00:56:36,943 --> 00:56:37,943
I'm going to
refer this case

966
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,361
to a higher court.

967
00:56:39,445 --> 00:56:40,863
Meanwhile,
I remand you both

968
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:42,281
in custody for 30 days.

969
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,703
If I may,
Your Honor.

970
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,965
Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.

971
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,341
Thank you,
Your Honor.

972
00:57:01,426 --> 00:57:03,594
It isn't my purpose
to interrupt proceedings,

973
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:07,389
but if the intention
is to remand these gentlemen,

974
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:09,766
I would respectfully ask
for a brief recess

975
00:57:09,851 --> 00:57:11,560
to allow me
to contact their counsel.

976
00:57:12,103 --> 00:57:13,312
Who is who?

977
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:14,563
Alfredo Quinones.

978
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,109
It would necessitate
getting him out of bed, of course.

979
00:57:19,193 --> 00:57:22,779
But given the importance
of these gentlemen to

980
00:57:23,323 --> 00:57:24,823
various interests,

981
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:28,493
I'm sure that he would
be as pleased as I

982
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:31,872
to come down here
at 3:00 in the morning.

983
00:57:37,837 --> 00:57:39,421
How much did
we cost him?

984
00:57:39,505 --> 00:57:41,506
About $1 ,000 apiece.

985
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:55,479
I can't thank
you enough.

986
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,522
Don't be late.

987
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:27,010
Mother of balls!

988
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,430
We got to rescue the car.

989
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:32,641
Not now.
We'll do it later.

990
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:33,934
I've got a meeting.

991
00:58:34,227 --> 00:58:35,811
We do not have later.

992
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,355
They've already
had it 12 hours.

993
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:41,066
I know how
these bastards work.

994
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,820
They can strip a train
to axles in 12 minutes.

995
00:58:46,406 --> 00:58:48,240
We'll be lucky
to find an oil spot.

996
00:58:52,578 --> 00:58:54,079
How long is this
gonna take?

997
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,330
How would I know?

998
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:56,498
I can't be late.

999
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:58,333
I don't know
why you're going at all.

1000
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:00,127
That guy is bad company.

1001
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:01,837
He's a manipulative prick.

1002
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:03,755
He manipulated us
out of jail, didn't he?

1003
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:05,924
Now he fucking owns us.

1004
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:09,261
I got a tongue like...

1005
00:59:11,097 --> 00:59:12,431
Like a towel.

1006
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:14,016
Want a beer?

1007
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:16,518
Do I want a beer?

1008
00:59:17,979 --> 00:59:19,479
No, I do not.

1009
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:22,858
I am never gonna
touch alcohol again.

1010
00:59:35,621 --> 00:59:37,414
What fresh
hell is this?

1011
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,249
Front seat's gone.

1012
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:41,501
That's a write-off.
Isn't it?

1013
00:59:58,019 --> 01:00:01,188
You know what,
I've got a brilliant idea.

1014
01:00:24,337 --> 01:00:25,879
What's that?

1015
01:00:26,214 --> 01:00:28,090
There's too much
weight on the axle.

1016
01:00:28,174 --> 01:00:30,217
Try and move
forward a bit.

1017
01:00:30,343 --> 01:00:31,760
Ugh, gonna be late.

1018
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:33,845
I'm gonna be a week late.

1019
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,850
What are you doing, Sala?

1020
01:00:39,227 --> 01:00:41,895
I suddenly realize
how much I like you.

1021
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:43,480
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

1022
01:00:43,564 --> 01:00:46,191
There's something wrong
with the axle.

1023
01:00:51,572 --> 01:00:53,657
Oh, my God,
it's the cop we set on fire.

1024
01:00:58,037 --> 01:00:59,830
Try and look normal.

1025
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,589
Make a right!
Make a right!

1026
01:01:09,674 --> 01:01:11,341
What right?
There is no right. Any right!

1027
01:01:37,201 --> 01:01:39,911
Oh, there he is.
Paul, come in.

1028
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,330
Sorry. There were
unexpected developments.

1029
01:01:42,415 --> 01:01:44,416
I had to go home
and start the day again.

1030
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,794
Tell me about it.
Some days are two sizes too small.

1031
01:01:48,379 --> 01:01:49,671
Well, I'm afraid
some of us had to leave.

1032
01:01:49,755 --> 01:01:51,673
But, Mr. Zimburger
you know.

1033
01:01:51,799 --> 01:01:54,342
And this is Mr. Green
of First National Maritime Bank.

1034
01:01:54,427 --> 01:01:55,427
You want some coffee?

1035
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,470
I think we should
move right along, Hal.

1036
01:01:57,555 --> 01:01:58,847
I gotta go.
Sure.

1037
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:00,432
Sit down, Paul.

1038
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,976
As you may know,
Mr. Kemp,

1039
01:02:03,477 --> 01:02:06,021
the island is owned
by the U.S. government.

1040
01:02:06,105 --> 01:02:08,607
Part of it presently
used as a target range by the Navy.

1041
01:02:09,275 --> 01:02:10,984
We know from
internal sources...

1042
01:02:11,068 --> 01:02:12,235
Is that what
you're calling me?

1043
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:17,199
...that the government
is preparing to relinquish the lease,

1044
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,159
and this place wakes up
as 32 square miles

1045
01:02:19,493 --> 01:02:21,912
of magnificent
and untouched real estate.

1046
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,331
Knock your eyes out.

1047
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,583
No prettier beaches
in the Caribbean.

1048
01:02:27,168 --> 01:02:30,587
Orientated around
one hell of a beautiful marina.

1049
01:02:32,632 --> 01:02:33,798
Thought it was one hotel.

1050
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,383
We start with one hotel.

1051
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:36,676
It's a foot in the door.

1052
01:02:36,761 --> 01:02:39,137
Once we're up and running,
we're servants of a market.

1053
01:02:39,972 --> 01:02:41,765
Like here?
Like here.

1054
01:02:42,475 --> 01:02:44,059
You look worried,
Mr. Kemp.

1055
01:02:45,186 --> 01:02:47,020
He's not worried.

1056
01:02:47,104 --> 01:02:48,396
Paul and I shared
a tricky little night.

1057
01:02:49,523 --> 01:02:51,066
Right, Paul?
Oh.

1058
01:02:51,442 --> 01:02:52,692
Neither of us
got much sleep.

1059
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:55,779
I gotta go, guys.

1060
01:02:55,863 --> 01:02:57,822
Well, we'll leave
you gentlemen to it.

1061
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,449
Has Mr. Kemp
signed the papers?

1062
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:01,326
Doing that
right now.

1063
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,329
What... What am I
actually signing?

1064
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,831
Just a confidentiality
agreement, affirmation of trust.

1065
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,751
Just so we're all sitting
in the same Jacuzzi.

1066
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:13,046
In case a turd floats up,
if you know what I mean.

1067
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:18,802
Come on, Paul,
let's go over here.

1068
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:24,766
Here you go.

1069
01:03:26,352 --> 01:03:28,019
It's just
a technicality, Paul.

1070
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,731
Means you promise
not to talk to anybody about the project.

1071
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:33,275
How's the head?

1072
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,734
Unpleasant.

1073
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:37,195
Gotta thank you again
for putting up the bail.

1074
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:39,656
It's held on
my cognizance.

1075
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,159
And I think it
more than likely to slip various minds.

1076
01:03:43,995 --> 01:03:46,413
This place is a sea
of money, Paul.

1077
01:03:46,664 --> 01:03:48,415
Unbelievable money.

1078
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:52,210
Practically every
major corporation hides its cash offshore.

1079
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:53,628
No, thanks.

1080
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:56,214
And that is
good news for us,

1081
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:59,050
because we are the shore.

1082
01:04:00,553 --> 01:04:02,971
Not one dollar
that wings its way into Puerto Rico

1083
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:04,556
pays a cent in tax.

1084
01:04:05,057 --> 01:04:06,558
Nothing?
Not penny one.

1085
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,851
That includes
chemical companies,

1086
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,477
oil companies,
mining companies.

1087
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,563
There's $12 billion
worth of copper

1088
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,065
in mountains less than
20 miles from here.

1089
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,526
A dozen billion dollars.

1090
01:04:19,238 --> 01:04:21,239
And there's
people like me

1091
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:23,616
who know how
to get it out.

1092
01:04:25,536 --> 01:04:28,246
So, putting it
into context,

1093
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:30,582
I don't envisage
the breaking of bones

1094
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,250
to get at a thousand bucks.

1095
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:35,628
Because you
weren't here,

1096
01:04:35,713 --> 01:04:38,131
I agreed to an itinerary
with Zimburger on your behalf.

1097
01:04:38,215 --> 01:04:41,760
You'll be traveling down
in the morning. Hope that's okay.

1098
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:48,558
What do you need, Paul?

1099
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:52,103
Well, just in the context
of this Zimburger thing,

1100
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:55,273
do you think
there's a possibility of an advance?

1101
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:58,526
I don't like to ask,
but Lotterman's pretty erratic

1102
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:00,111
with the paycheck,
you know.

1103
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,237
Need to get
a hold of a car.

1104
01:05:01,614 --> 01:05:02,655
You don't have a car?

1105
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:04,491
Nothing too reliable.

1106
01:05:04,575 --> 01:05:06,951
Plus, sooner or later,
I'm gonna have to find a decent place to live.

1107
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,411
Well, we can
help you with that.

1108
01:05:08,496 --> 01:05:11,831
When you get back,
we'll sort you out something with a view.

1109
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:16,419
Carol, what do we
have in the garage?

1110
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:19,631
No, no, no, no,
no, no, not that.

1111
01:05:19,965 --> 01:05:22,175
Yeah, that's fine.
Okay, thank you.

1112
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:26,137
Got you a car.
She'll give you the keys on the way out.

1113
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:30,850
Feels like 500?

1114
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,479
Yeah. Thanks.

1115
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,273
Oh, Paul...

1116
01:05:37,983 --> 01:05:39,401
How's your afternoon?

1117
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:41,069
A half-written horoscope.

1118
01:05:41,153 --> 01:05:43,905
Do me a favor, will you?
Drive out to the beach and pick up Chenault.

1119
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:45,448
I need her
downstairs by 6:00.

1120
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:46,866
All right.

1121
01:06:30,077 --> 01:06:31,661
So, this one?

1122
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:34,372
Or...

1123
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,542
This one?

1124
01:06:38,169 --> 01:06:39,627
What are these for,
a party?

1125
01:06:39,712 --> 01:06:41,379
It's for carnival.

1126
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,715
Didn't he say anything
to you about it?

1127
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:46,676
No.
Oh, you've got to come.

1128
01:06:47,011 --> 01:06:49,262
We're all going down
on the boat.

1129
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,890
He didn't invite me.

1130
01:06:52,057 --> 01:06:54,017
Well, it isn't
his carnival.

1131
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:56,227
Oh, this one.

1132
01:06:58,355 --> 01:07:00,398
Um...
I like the other one.

1133
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:06,696
Yes.

1134
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:21,586
Love this car.

1135
01:07:23,464 --> 01:07:24,881
Did he give it to you?

1136
01:07:24,965 --> 01:07:26,591
I wish.

1137
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:28,885
Fast.

1138
01:07:31,096 --> 01:07:32,639
You want a little bet?

1139
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,433
A bet about what?

1140
01:07:35,893 --> 01:07:38,019
That you scream
before I do.

1141
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:41,439
That I scream
before you do,

1142
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:42,565
in relation to what?

1143
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:45,568
Well, how fast
does it go?

1144
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:48,112
I don't know.

1145
01:07:50,783 --> 01:07:52,283
That's the bet.

1146
01:07:57,957 --> 01:08:00,250
I already crashed
one car today.

1147
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,130
It's okay.
I'll just go sit

1148
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,340
in the foyer
and wait for him.

1149
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,146
What do I get if I win?

1150
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:25,400
I'll let you know
if you do.

1151
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:16,552
Come on,
I'll take you back.

1152
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,274
Christ,
where'd they get this?

1153
01:10:30,776 --> 01:10:33,945
I don't remember.
I've been slightly avoiding Lotterman.

1154
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,489
You have me to thank
for your freedom.

1155
01:10:36,573 --> 01:10:37,782
Thanks.

1156
01:10:38,283 --> 01:10:40,243
I got a feeling
of total anxiety

1157
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:44,122
trying to put
my anxieties together in a single, coherent lump.

1158
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:46,541
I'm fucked without a car.

1159
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:47,792
I got us a car.

1160
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:50,044
It's the Chevy downstairs.

1161
01:10:50,129 --> 01:10:52,255
It belongs to Mr. Sanderson.

1162
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,631
So what?

1163
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:55,842
I gotta go
type this up.

1164
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:01,264
I don't know
what's going on.

1165
01:11:01,348 --> 01:11:03,766
He's freaking out
and we're down 12 pages.

1166
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:07,353
You better
frigging do it!

1167
01:11:07,438 --> 01:11:09,397
I see your filthy
animal face in here again,

1168
01:11:09,481 --> 01:11:11,482
I'll have you
locked up!

1169
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:13,860
What part of the building
are you creeping towards, Sala?

1170
01:11:13,986 --> 01:11:15,570
Darkroom.
Cops are looking for you.

1171
01:11:15,654 --> 01:11:16,946
Looking for me?
Looking for you.

1172
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,698
And it ain't
just your mug in the paper!

1173
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:20,575
What a day.

1174
01:11:21,201 --> 01:11:22,618
What a week.

1175
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:24,078
I tell you,
I'm out of here.

1176
01:11:24,163 --> 01:11:25,997
One way to
friggin' Mexico.

1177
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:29,959
Listen, I got
a trip tomorrow. Sanderson's island.

1178
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:31,794
No, no, no.
Oh, dear.

1179
01:11:32,296 --> 01:11:34,756
It's green money,
and I'm thinking of cutting across for the carnival.

1180
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,257
You know they
got that carnival in Saint Thomas.

1181
01:11:36,341 --> 01:11:37,592
I know.

1182
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,802
Why don't you
come with me?

1183
01:11:39,887 --> 01:11:42,096
Give the cops
a few days to forget.

1184
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:44,307
Yeah. Fun.

1185
01:12:17,549 --> 01:12:20,510
Our guys.
12-inch Naval, 14 miles out.

1186
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:22,762
Nobody lives here?

1187
01:12:23,222 --> 01:12:25,473
No one who's staying.

1188
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:26,933
Lazar!

1189
01:12:27,017 --> 01:12:28,351
Mr. Zimburger.

1190
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:35,024
This is Mr. Lazar,
our much put-upon site architect.

1191
01:12:35,108 --> 01:12:36,317
How do you do.
Hello.

1192
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:37,485
Mr. Monk,
I think you know.

1193
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:39,403
I assist Mr. Green,
First Maritime Bank.

1194
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,447
This is Mr. Kemp
from The New York Times.

1195
01:12:41,532 --> 01:12:42,573
What did you say
your name was?

1196
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,450
Bob Sala.
Yeah, Sala.

1197
01:12:44,535 --> 01:12:47,203
From American
Travel Writers Association.

1198
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:52,124
Mr. Kemp is
preparing our brochure.

1199
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:54,669
"Wish you were here."

1200
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:56,879
Beer in the cooler,
gentlemen.

1201
01:12:56,964 --> 01:12:59,090
I have everything
next door.

1202
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,594
This and this are
the main hotels.

1203
01:13:04,137 --> 01:13:05,513
22 floors.

1204
01:13:05,806 --> 01:13:08,099
Guardians of the bay,
so to speak.

1205
01:13:08,642 --> 01:13:10,059
Why the different colors?

1206
01:13:10,644 --> 01:13:13,771
Blue is for
public dissemination, red is for the investors.

1207
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:17,608
Yeah.
Hill villas, ocean condos.

1208
01:13:19,778 --> 01:13:20,987
Marina.

1209
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:24,115
Parking for 2,000 cars.

1210
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,575
There's no roads.

1211
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,619
Damn it, Lazar,
you forgot the roads!

1212
01:13:30,247 --> 01:13:33,124
We're building them.
We're building them.

1213
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:36,002
Let's have some lunch.

1214
01:13:52,019 --> 01:13:56,063
10,000 waiters, maids,
bellhops, janitors, clerks.

1215
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,944
Plus, whores
for the fat man.

1216
01:14:02,112 --> 01:14:04,238
Hard to believe
they'd do it.

1217
01:14:11,872 --> 01:14:14,790
I was talking to that
architect kind of guy.

1218
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,919
He's going
to Saint Thomas, if you want a ride.

1219
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:19,128
When?

1220
01:14:19,212 --> 01:14:20,755
How do I know when?

1221
01:14:20,839 --> 01:14:22,798
When he's finished here.

1222
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:25,676
You know what
Oscar Wilde said?

1223
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,388
"They know the price
of everything,

1224
01:14:30,182 --> 01:14:32,099
"the value of nothing."

1225
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,536
Two rums.

1226
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,039
I thought
you'd given up.

1227
01:14:55,374 --> 01:14:57,375
Finally beat my willpower.

1228
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:01,963
Come on,
let's go here.

1229
01:15:16,103 --> 01:15:17,895
Hey, mi amigo!

1230
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:22,066
Hey, Rosie's a singer.

1231
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:04,942
Paul!

1232
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:09,363
Where's Hal?

1233
01:16:09,448 --> 01:16:11,073
Boat.
Boat?

1234
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:13,159
Help me find
my girlfriend.

1235
01:16:17,914 --> 01:16:19,957
Hey!
How are you?

1236
01:16:21,626 --> 01:16:22,752
Watch your step.

1237
01:16:22,836 --> 01:16:24,003
Thank you.
All right.

1238
01:16:24,087 --> 01:16:25,087
There we go.
Thank you.

1239
01:16:25,172 --> 01:16:26,213
Hi.

1240
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:27,715
Look at you.

1241
01:16:28,008 --> 01:16:30,509
Good.
Grab some champagne.

1242
01:16:30,927 --> 01:16:32,011
Hey, Captain.

1243
01:16:32,179 --> 01:16:33,596
Hey.
Hey.

1244
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,768
Did you take Sala
to the island?

1245
01:16:42,606 --> 01:16:44,899
You shouldn't have
done that, Paul.

1246
01:16:44,983 --> 01:16:46,859
It's why we have
a confidentiality agreement.

1247
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,486
He isn't interested.

1248
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,696
He's got a mouth
like an AP wire.

1249
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,327
I just don't know
what he was doing there.

1250
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:59,580
And I sure as shit don't
know what he's doing here.

1251
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,821
Not going glum
on us, are you?

1252
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:34,865
Just thoughts.

1253
01:17:36,326 --> 01:17:37,701
What's the book?

1254
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:40,079
The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner.

1255
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:43,582
It was written in 1797
by a junkie called Coleridge.

1256
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,337
He wrote that
when he was 25 years old.

1257
01:17:50,048 --> 01:17:53,384
I've been dragging
a typewriter around with me for 10.

1258
01:17:53,885 --> 01:17:54,969
I've written nothing.

1259
01:17:55,053 --> 01:17:56,929
You've written some books.

1260
01:17:57,013 --> 01:17:58,180
Nah.

1261
01:17:58,682 --> 01:18:00,349
They had no voice.

1262
01:18:03,603 --> 01:18:05,980
I don't know how
to write like me.

1263
01:18:10,902 --> 01:18:12,403
I resent that.

1264
01:18:12,571 --> 01:18:14,446
No, I really have
to say he's all right.

1265
01:18:14,531 --> 01:18:15,781
I have to admit.

1266
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:17,700
Fair is fair.
Fair is fair.

1267
01:18:17,784 --> 01:18:18,868
Thank you
for the afternoon.

1268
01:18:18,952 --> 01:18:20,411
Maybe we'll see
you in town.

1269
01:18:20,537 --> 01:18:21,579
Where you going?

1270
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:23,789
Her friend's
playing in a band.

1271
01:18:23,874 --> 01:18:25,124
We're gonna go
check it out.

1272
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,333
Oh, we want to come.

1273
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:28,294
I'll rephrase that.

1274
01:18:28,545 --> 01:18:29,628
We don't want to come.

1275
01:18:29,713 --> 01:18:31,505
Yes, we do.
Us girls want to dance.

1276
01:18:32,048 --> 01:18:33,507
You're dancing tomorrow.

1277
01:18:33,592 --> 01:18:35,134
What's the point
of going to carnival

1278
01:18:35,218 --> 01:18:36,343
if everything
is preplanned?

1279
01:18:37,095 --> 01:18:38,679
I want to dance,
and if you're not going to take me,

1280
01:18:38,763 --> 01:18:40,514
I'm gonna go with them.
She's got you trumped, Hal.

1281
01:18:40,599 --> 01:18:41,807
Sit down. You're drunk.

1282
01:18:42,475 --> 01:18:44,268
So what?
So is everyone else.

1283
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,603
Come on.

1284
01:18:45,896 --> 01:18:48,105
Come on, let's do it.
It might be amusing.

1285
01:18:56,907 --> 01:18:58,282
Oh, cuidado.
Careful.

1286
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:00,284
Here we go.

1287
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,353
Oh.
Yeah.

1288
01:19:41,159 --> 01:19:42,243
We're done.
We're spent.

1289
01:19:42,327 --> 01:19:43,535
You're gonna go?
Yes, we're gonna leave.

1290
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,620
You're done?

1291
01:19:44,704 --> 01:19:46,080
I can't dance no more.
Really.

1292
01:19:46,164 --> 01:19:48,999
Hold on. You know what?
I'll be out. Let me just get Chenault.

1293
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,839
You want
rum or beer?

1294
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,091
Um... Both.

1295
01:19:57,175 --> 01:20:00,511
Dos, uh, rum, uh,
dos cervezas.

1296
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:01,762
Oh, whoa, whoa.
We're gonna go.

1297
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:03,430
Hey.
We're gonna go.

1298
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,599
- What?
- Natalie's leaving,

1299
01:20:05,684 --> 01:20:06,976
so let's go.
- Hey, hey.

1300
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,978
Come on, come on.
No, no, no, no.

1301
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:11,146
Oh!

1302
01:20:11,523 --> 01:20:13,524
Chenault, come here.
We're leaving.

1303
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:17,236
Chenault.
Stop it!

1304
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:18,862
Chenault!

1305
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:26,036
? Hey, what?

1306
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,132
? I hear you

1307
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:39,633
? Yeah

1308
01:20:40,343 --> 01:20:41,844
? I hear you

1309
01:20:42,721 --> 01:20:43,804
? Yeah

1310
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:47,141
? You all right?

1311
01:20:57,068 --> 01:20:58,360
? Try it

1312
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,446
? Try it again

1313
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:03,073
? You try it again

1314
01:21:04,075 --> 01:21:05,576
? Try it again

1315
01:21:05,952 --> 01:21:07,745
? Shall we just sit?

1316
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:09,455
? Try again

1317
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,165
? Like a baby

1318
01:21:12,584 --> 01:21:14,293
? Won't you try it?

1319
01:21:14,419 --> 01:21:16,170
? You might like it

1320
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:22,926
? Honey

1321
01:21:23,595 --> 01:21:24,762
? Yeah

1322
01:21:25,805 --> 01:21:27,264
? Yeah, ha

1323
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:29,767
? It's all right

1324
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:31,643
? I tried

1325
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:34,146
? That's right

1326
01:21:59,506 --> 01:22:01,465
Chenault, come here!
Chenault!

1327
01:22:02,092 --> 01:22:04,802
Get your hands off me,
you motherfucker!

1328
01:22:06,596 --> 01:22:07,679
? Yeah?

1329
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,601
You want to
fuck with me?

1330
01:22:12,977 --> 01:22:15,521
You know who I am?

1331
01:22:15,605 --> 01:22:17,022
You motherfucker!

1332
01:22:17,107 --> 01:22:18,982
You know who I am?

1333
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,279
You're a dead man!
Go! Go!

1334
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:25,656
Get your hands off me.

1335
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,157
You're a dead man!
Go!

1336
01:22:27,492 --> 01:22:28,867
Forget it.

1337
01:22:30,662 --> 01:22:32,496
We'll call you a cab.
Fuck off!

1338
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,585
I gotta get the girl.

1339
01:22:38,837 --> 01:22:41,171
She's having
a good time. We closed.

1340
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,426
You deaf?

1341
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:47,177
I said we closed.

1342
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,762
No way, Paul.

1343
01:22:49,222 --> 01:22:50,472
No way.

1344
01:23:21,713 --> 01:23:23,464
I looked everywhere.

1345
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,049
I went to the gendarme.

1346
01:23:26,843 --> 01:23:27,968
And?

1347
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:30,637
We went up there.

1348
01:23:30,722 --> 01:23:32,556
Nothing. Nobody there.

1349
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:36,768
But an old woman
with a mop.

1350
01:23:39,063 --> 01:23:41,565
She was more help
than the cops were.

1351
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,152
"What can I do
if your girlfriend likes someone else?" he said.

1352
01:23:45,945 --> 01:23:48,071
He's right
about that, Paul.

1353
01:23:49,782 --> 01:23:51,700
She's not
your girlfriend.

1354
01:24:01,419 --> 01:24:05,756
Maybe... Maybe she
went back to the boat.

1355
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:08,258
Huh?

1356
01:24:09,802 --> 01:24:12,095
Did you...
Did you try the boat?

1357
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,764
No.

1358
01:24:15,099 --> 01:24:17,518
I don't think
he'd let her back on.

1359
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:37,913
Is she with you?

1360
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:41,792
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business?

1361
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,295
I want the keys.

1362
01:24:46,256 --> 01:24:47,589
The Chevy.

1363
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:07,818
You blew it, Kemp.

1364
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,344
It's all rust.

1365
01:25:38,182 --> 01:25:41,393
I've seen better tires
hanging over the side of a tug.

1366
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,729
You want it or not?

1367
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,525
Yeah, we want it.

1368
01:25:49,694 --> 01:25:52,904
Everyone turns up
for their Friday check, right?

1369
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,198
No check, no Lotterman.

1370
01:25:56,034 --> 01:25:59,536
So I go around to see
that unforgivably ugly wife of his.

1371
01:25:59,871 --> 01:26:01,913
She tells me
he's gone to Miami.

1372
01:26:01,998 --> 01:26:03,248
For what?

1373
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:05,459
You don't know,
I don't know.

1374
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:08,086
But the scabs are back.

1375
01:26:09,339 --> 01:26:12,716
Since Morell went,
the paper took a turn for the worse.

1376
01:26:15,053 --> 01:26:16,637
Is there anything
in the spinner?

1377
01:26:16,721 --> 01:26:18,388
We need
a fresh sack.

1378
01:26:18,723 --> 01:26:22,184
Well, maybe I can
interest you gentlemen in something else.

1379
01:26:22,518 --> 01:26:24,061
Like what, death?

1380
01:26:24,771 --> 01:26:27,814
Like the most powerful drug
in the history of narcotics.

1381
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,611
I'm not at liberty
to discuss or disclose.

1382
01:26:32,737 --> 01:26:33,987
All I can tell you

1383
01:26:34,072 --> 01:26:35,822
is this stuff
is so powerful,

1384
01:26:36,783 --> 01:26:37,991
they give it to Communists.

1385
01:26:38,576 --> 01:26:39,660
Who does?

1386
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:41,328
The FBI.

1387
01:26:41,746 --> 01:26:44,331
Why would the FBI
get Communists high?

1388
01:26:45,124 --> 01:26:47,250
That I can't help you with.

1389
01:26:48,961 --> 01:26:51,004
You take it like eye drops.

1390
01:26:53,716 --> 01:26:54,841
In the eye?

1391
01:26:54,926 --> 01:26:56,551
So I understand.

1392
01:26:57,929 --> 01:26:59,346
It makes the eye
see things.

1393
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:01,056
You see
a different reality.

1394
01:27:02,141 --> 01:27:03,308
What do you want for it?

1395
01:27:03,393 --> 01:27:04,685
I'll throw it in
with the bike

1396
01:27:04,769 --> 01:27:06,603
if you do me a favor.

1397
01:27:06,729 --> 01:27:08,605
What's the favor?

1398
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:13,318
I want you to come
to the bathroom with me.

1399
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:16,738
He's your man.

1400
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,782
$50, right?
Yeah.

1401
01:27:34,173 --> 01:27:36,091
He wants me
to look at his dick.

1402
01:27:36,175 --> 01:27:37,801
I flatly refused.

1403
01:27:38,136 --> 01:27:39,803
What does he want you
to look at it for?

1404
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,221
Says there's something
wrong with it.

1405
01:27:41,305 --> 01:27:42,472
It's a gentleman's
matter.

1406
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:43,724
I'm not
looking at it!

1407
01:27:43,808 --> 01:27:45,100
All right, give me
the drugs back.

1408
01:27:45,184 --> 01:27:46,476
No! Wait.

1409
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:48,729
I'll look at it.

1410
01:27:53,818 --> 01:27:55,819
I'll view it
in the mirror.

1411
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,465
Is it clap?

1412
01:28:18,801 --> 01:28:20,510
A standing ovation.

1413
01:28:49,165 --> 01:28:50,791
You see anything?

1414
01:28:51,167 --> 01:28:52,292
No.

1415
01:28:55,171 --> 01:28:56,630
Neither do I.

1416
01:29:15,441 --> 01:29:17,818
We'll give it another
five minutes.

1417
01:29:19,278 --> 01:29:20,695
Trouble
making ends meet?

1418
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,031
Then, you need
the Lending Man. Right.

1419
01:29:23,115 --> 01:29:25,075
? When money dries up fast

1420
01:29:25,618 --> 01:29:27,661
? You're welcome
to our cash

1421
01:29:27,745 --> 01:29:30,121
? So borrow from
the Lending Man?

1422
01:29:30,248 --> 01:29:32,123
Call the Lending Man now.

1423
01:29:53,145 --> 01:29:55,146
How long since
we took it?

1424
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:00,277
I don't know.

1425
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:03,738
A while.

1426
01:30:12,415 --> 01:30:13,456
Bullshit, isn't it?

1427
01:30:15,126 --> 01:30:16,626
Is it bullshit?

1428
01:31:43,422 --> 01:31:44,464
Jesus.

1429
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:48,468
Your tongue is like
an accusatory giblet.

1430
01:31:55,226 --> 01:31:57,102
For Christ's sake,
keep it out.

1431
01:31:57,186 --> 01:31:58,353
What are you
talking about?

1432
01:31:58,437 --> 01:31:59,980
Your tongue
belongs to Satan!

1433
01:32:00,064 --> 01:32:01,272
Are you out of your mind?

1434
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:02,941
Keep it out!

1435
01:32:04,235 --> 01:32:06,152
If it goes back
into your mouth, it'll kill you.

1436
01:32:08,114 --> 01:32:09,322
We've got to get it
into the sink!

1437
01:32:11,283 --> 01:32:12,993
You're giving me fear.

1438
01:32:13,077 --> 01:32:14,494
Stop it!
I've got fear!

1439
01:32:14,578 --> 01:32:16,121
Fuck you. So do I.

1440
01:32:16,205 --> 01:32:17,414
You're high, you fool.

1441
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:18,790
Drink some rum.

1442
01:32:40,604 --> 01:32:43,148
I thought I was
losing grip in there.

1443
01:32:45,443 --> 01:32:46,526
What did we take?

1444
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:48,111
I don't know.

1445
01:32:50,489 --> 01:32:52,490
We need to get some more.

1446
01:33:04,837 --> 01:33:05,920
That explains it.

1447
01:33:08,799 --> 01:33:10,133
Doesn't it?

1448
01:33:10,468 --> 01:33:12,093
Explains what?

1449
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:16,181
The world.

1450
01:33:18,642 --> 01:33:19,976
And us.

1451
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:27,358
I wonder
what it is

1452
01:33:27,443 --> 01:33:30,278
you might think about
our different worlds.

1453
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:35,283
He looked at me
kind of sideways and said,

1454
01:33:35,826 --> 01:33:39,329
"Human beings
are the only creatures on Earth

1455
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:41,915
"that claim a God.

1456
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:47,087
"And the only living thing
that behaves like it hasn't got one.

1457
01:33:49,006 --> 01:33:51,800
"Does the world belong
to no one but you?"

1458
01:33:54,136 --> 01:33:56,846
And when he said it,
I was taken aback.

1459
01:33:58,891 --> 01:34:01,643
Not because of who
was doing the talking,

1460
01:34:01,894 --> 01:34:04,604
because I finally
understood the connection

1461
01:34:04,688 --> 01:34:07,190
between children
scavenging for food

1462
01:34:07,858 --> 01:34:11,486
and shiny brass plates
on the front doors of banks.

1463
01:34:13,405 --> 01:34:14,739
Gotta go.

1464
01:34:43,102 --> 01:34:44,602
Shh. Come in.

1465
01:34:45,229 --> 01:34:46,479
Come in.

1466
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:52,402
We gotta go.

1467
01:34:52,903 --> 01:34:54,779
Give me a minute.

1468
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,577
I'll be waiting
for you downstairs.

1469
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:15,008
Oh, how nice of you
to drop in.

1470
01:35:15,092 --> 01:35:16,509
I was covering
the carnival.

1471
01:35:16,594 --> 01:35:17,927
That's not what I heard.

1472
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:20,180
I heard you were
in the moonlight for Sanderson.

1473
01:35:20,264 --> 01:35:21,306
I was what?

1474
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:22,765
Moonlighting
for Sanderson.

1475
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:23,850
Where's Segurra?

1476
01:35:23,934 --> 01:35:25,268
Mr. Segurra's
no longer with us.

1477
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:26,352
I got a story for you.

1478
01:35:26,437 --> 01:35:29,189
Yeah, you may have noticed
that I'm somewhat busy.

1479
01:35:29,273 --> 01:35:33,109
This is real important,
involving Mr. Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.

1480
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:34,694
I'm gonna tell you
how important it isn't.

1481
01:35:34,778 --> 01:35:37,614
I got 21 jobs on the line
and a newspaper going under.

1482
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:39,199
Print this,
and you'll sell it.

1483
01:35:39,283 --> 01:35:40,700
A planning scam.

1484
01:35:40,784 --> 01:35:42,827
Literally despoliation
of a paradise.

1485
01:35:42,912 --> 01:35:45,163
A thousand people
will be swept into the sea like garbage.

1486
01:35:45,456 --> 01:35:46,706
You are weird, Kemp.

1487
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:49,000
It's not what it's doing
to them, it's what it's doing to you.

1488
01:35:49,293 --> 01:35:50,543
It's called journalism.

1489
01:35:50,628 --> 01:35:52,003
Oh, make me laugh.

1490
01:35:52,463 --> 01:35:53,880
I asked you
to tidy up the booze,

1491
01:35:53,964 --> 01:35:55,590
you couldn't even
sweep out a room.

1492
01:35:55,674 --> 01:35:56,925
Why do you think
you're working here?

1493
01:35:57,009 --> 01:36:00,136
'Cause you're everything
that's wrong with a journalist.

1494
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,639
And you're everything
that's wrong with this insult of a newspaper.

1495
01:36:02,723 --> 01:36:04,474
Unanimously agreed.

1496
01:36:04,767 --> 01:36:06,643
Why don't you
shut it, Moburg?

1497
01:36:07,186 --> 01:36:09,479
You are a waste
of human sperm.

1498
01:36:11,482 --> 01:36:15,610
Die a prolonged and
relentlessly agonizing death!

1499
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,168
Enjoy her.

1500
01:36:57,736 --> 01:36:59,404
Made you some tea.

1501
01:37:06,537 --> 01:37:08,538
You should try
and sleep.

1502
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:10,498
I stole your bed.

1503
01:37:11,208 --> 01:37:12,959
It's okay.

1504
01:37:13,377 --> 01:37:15,128
I'm going to write.

1505
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:21,759
I'm so sorry.

1506
01:37:23,387 --> 01:37:24,887
Don't be sorry.

1507
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:30,893
You did me
the best favor I ever had.

1508
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,067
There is no dream,
Chenault.

1509
01:37:40,237 --> 01:37:42,322
Just a piss
puddle of greed,

1510
01:37:43,615 --> 01:37:45,867
spreading
throughout the world.

1511
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:54,125
I want
to make a promise to you, the reader.

1512
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:57,628
And I don't know
if I can fulfill it tomorrow

1513
01:37:57,713 --> 01:37:59,797
or even
the day after that.

1514
01:38:00,424 --> 01:38:03,468
But I put the bastards
of this world on notice.

1515
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:07,889
That I do not have their
best interests at heart.

1516
01:38:09,683 --> 01:38:12,101
I will try and speak
for my reader.

1517
01:38:13,062 --> 01:38:14,771
That is my promise.

1518
01:38:15,272 --> 01:38:19,901
And it will be a voice
made of ink and rage.

1519
01:38:23,155 --> 01:38:24,864
Sit down.
I made you coffee.

1520
01:38:24,948 --> 01:38:26,282
Oh, thanks.

1521
01:38:29,078 --> 01:38:31,245
One for you
and one for me.

1522
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:37,794
Oh, man, I would
rather not start the day with this.

1523
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,338
What is it?
It's a writ.

1524
01:38:40,422 --> 01:38:41,923
Means we're
going to court.

1525
01:38:42,007 --> 01:38:44,425
It means
they can arrest us, should they so desire,

1526
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:46,386
any damn minute
they please.

1527
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:48,054
We need to speak
to a lawyer.

1528
01:38:48,138 --> 01:38:49,931
We don't even
have a phone.

1529
01:38:50,015 --> 01:38:51,641
I know an old guy,
Spanish Advocate.

1530
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:53,226
Kind of owes me one.

1531
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,769
You should get dressed.
We'll go down there.

1532
01:38:54,853 --> 01:38:57,313
Water ran out.
I'm covered in soap.

1533
01:38:57,564 --> 01:38:59,315
Fuck it.
See what I can do.

1534
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:02,902
What's it for?

1535
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:05,279
Uh... It's Hal.

1536
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:11,119
He put up a bond for us
on this thing, and now he's pulled it.

1537
01:39:11,203 --> 01:39:12,328
Here.

1538
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:20,336
You know
he's a crook, Paul.

1539
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:23,131
And we get the writs.

1540
01:40:59,895 --> 01:41:01,270
What is it?

1541
01:41:01,772 --> 01:41:04,023
It's, er... Hitler.

1542
01:41:13,325 --> 01:41:14,659
It's over.

1543
01:41:14,952 --> 01:41:15,952
What is?

1544
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,038
They shut us down.

1545
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:22,416
He just
stood there and lied to us.

1546
01:41:22,501 --> 01:41:23,709
He hasn't got
the morality

1547
01:41:23,794 --> 01:41:25,211
of a clapped out
cash register.

1548
01:41:25,295 --> 01:41:26,963
I hate to tell
you this, guys,

1549
01:41:27,047 --> 01:41:28,881
but it was
to avoid severance.

1550
01:41:28,966 --> 01:41:30,716
We all know what
it was for, Charlie.

1551
01:41:30,801 --> 01:41:32,552
What are we gonna do?
Nothing.

1552
01:41:32,636 --> 01:41:34,053
There's nothing
we can do,

1553
01:41:34,137 --> 01:41:35,596
except report him
to the labor board,

1554
01:41:35,681 --> 01:41:37,348
which is the same thing
as doing nothing.

1555
01:41:37,432 --> 01:41:38,808
I disagree.

1556
01:41:38,934 --> 01:41:40,685
We gotta strike back

1557
01:41:41,144 --> 01:41:43,479
and nail this bastard
to his own front door.

1558
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:45,231
And how,
pray, do we do that?

1559
01:41:45,315 --> 01:41:47,191
By printing the paper.

1560
01:41:47,776 --> 01:41:49,777
We got tons of stuff
on Lotterman.

1561
01:41:49,861 --> 01:41:52,822
Every happy maggot with
his hand in the till.

1562
01:41:53,323 --> 01:41:55,491
It may be
the last-ever issue,

1563
01:41:55,617 --> 01:41:57,410
but we go out
in a blaze of rage.

1564
01:41:57,494 --> 01:42:00,621
What are you
talking about? It costs $2,200 a shot.

1565
01:42:00,831 --> 01:42:01,872
We bring in the scabs.

1566
01:42:01,999 --> 01:42:03,082
They're picketing for money.

1567
01:42:03,542 --> 01:42:04,709
You're through
the looking glass.

1568
01:42:04,835 --> 01:42:07,336
We haven't even
got enough money for drinks.

1569
01:42:08,672 --> 01:42:09,672
It's not worth the fight.

1570
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:11,841
This has been coming down
the pike for a long time.

1571
01:42:11,925 --> 01:42:13,426
You got to know
it's over when it's over.

1572
01:42:13,802 --> 01:42:15,761
This lousy little
Caribbean rag is nothing

1573
01:42:15,846 --> 01:42:17,305
but a wrapping
for fish heads.

1574
01:42:17,389 --> 01:42:18,431
Plus,
it's a lockout.

1575
01:42:18,515 --> 01:42:20,016
Fuck the locks.

1576
01:42:20,892 --> 01:42:22,768
I say we just walk in.

1577
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:26,856
Anybody with me?

1578
01:42:30,027 --> 01:42:31,110
Bob?

1579
01:42:32,487 --> 01:42:34,363
You know I'm with you.

1580
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:41,037
We didn't
pay the bill.

1581
01:42:45,208 --> 01:42:46,709
Where's Chenault?

1582
01:43:00,098 --> 01:43:02,016
She's gone
to New York.

1583
01:43:03,435 --> 01:43:05,061
She left me $100.

1584
01:43:05,854 --> 01:43:07,563
I don't believe it.

1585
01:43:08,357 --> 01:43:10,107
She didn't have any money.

1586
01:43:10,192 --> 01:43:12,109
You should use it
to go with her.

1587
01:43:12,194 --> 01:43:13,903
Red-eye for 50 bucks.

1588
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:15,071
No.

1589
01:43:16,031 --> 01:43:17,907
I'm not going anywhere.

1590
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:22,453
By some means or
another, I'm gonna put the paper out.

1591
01:43:22,537 --> 01:43:24,497
Print the bastard,
then we're gone.

1592
01:43:24,581 --> 01:43:26,499
Face the reality, Paul.

1593
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,793
There's no job,
no money, no girl,

1594
01:43:28,877 --> 01:43:30,670
and a warrant out
for our arrest.

1595
01:43:30,754 --> 01:43:31,962
There's no contest.

1596
01:43:32,047 --> 01:43:33,839
Donovan's right,
it ain't worth the fight.

1597
01:43:33,924 --> 01:43:35,174
I'm not Donovan!

1598
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:37,593
And I'm not
like the others.

1599
01:43:38,095 --> 01:43:40,304
I'm telling you
right now, next time some greasy moron

1600
01:43:40,389 --> 01:43:43,265
starts bullshitting me,
I'm going after him.

1601
01:43:45,102 --> 01:43:47,603
All the way up
to the president of the United States.

1602
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:50,606
I just want
to win one once.

1603
01:43:51,108 --> 01:43:52,608
One sheet.

1604
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:54,985
You ain't gonna
get far on $100.

1605
01:43:55,278 --> 01:43:57,822
Some of the scabs
will do it for nothing.

1606
01:43:57,906 --> 01:44:00,700
We're gonna need
20 guys, plus vans.

1607
01:44:00,784 --> 01:44:03,202
No, no, all you need
is two grand.

1608
01:44:05,414 --> 01:44:07,039
We're out of rum.

1609
01:44:11,169 --> 01:44:13,963
It's as if God,
in a fit of disgust,

1610
01:44:14,381 --> 01:44:16,632
has decided
to wipe us all out.

1611
01:44:23,306 --> 01:44:26,976
Yea, the cock crows thrice.

1612
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:34,984
What about El Monstruo?

1613
01:44:37,612 --> 01:44:39,697
Bet the $100
on El Monstruo.

1614
01:45:00,802 --> 01:45:02,344
How do you know
he lives here?

1615
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:03,929
I saw him come out.

1616
01:45:04,014 --> 01:45:06,515
You better let me
do this on my own.

1617
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:13,439
If he gets it,
we should bring it to Papa Nebo.

1618
01:45:13,857 --> 01:45:14,982
Who's that?

1619
01:45:15,358 --> 01:45:16,525
My witch doctor.

1620
01:45:16,985 --> 01:45:18,861
She's a hermaphrodite.

1621
01:45:21,281 --> 01:45:23,407
Stop here!
Stop here!

1622
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:29,079
By day, she drives
a garbage truck.

1623
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:33,167
By night,
she becomes Papa Nebo,

1624
01:45:34,211 --> 01:45:36,879
the hermaphroditic
oracle of the dead.

1625
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:41,258
When permission
is granted from Papa Samedi,

1626
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:44,345
the keeper
of the cemetery,

1627
01:45:44,513 --> 01:45:45,971
she'll visit,

1628
01:45:46,097 --> 01:45:48,182
and she'll dig up
a corpse.

1629
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:51,727
Certain organs of
the disgrounded stiffs

1630
01:45:52,062 --> 01:45:56,482
are indispensable
for use in ouangas.

1631
01:46:17,295 --> 01:46:19,296
This is horseshit,
isn't it?

1632
01:46:19,381 --> 01:46:21,090
She cured my prick.

1633
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:36,438
She wants to know
what you want.

1634
01:46:38,942 --> 01:46:41,569
We want her
to empower this fowl.

1635
01:46:42,529 --> 01:46:44,196
We want it blessed

1636
01:46:44,698 --> 01:46:48,576
and anything that tries
to fight it, dead.

1637
01:46:53,415 --> 01:46:55,207
Bring forth the fowl.

1638
01:47:39,794 --> 01:47:43,005
She says that
no fowl on Earth

1639
01:47:43,089 --> 01:47:45,841
could challenge this
cockerel and survive.

1640
01:47:46,009 --> 01:47:47,051
Great.

1641
01:47:47,135 --> 01:47:48,177
How's she off
for curses?

1642
01:47:49,304 --> 01:47:51,055
Pretty good.

1643
01:47:51,473 --> 01:47:54,475
Let's have a curse
on Sanderson. Make his dick fall off.

1644
01:47:54,559 --> 01:47:55,976
And that fucker
at the bank, Green.

1645
01:47:56,353 --> 01:47:57,645
Mr. Green.

1646
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:13,202
Jesus!

1647
01:48:13,328 --> 01:48:14,578
Curse active!

1648
01:48:33,723 --> 01:48:34,932
Okay, come on.

1649
01:49:10,385 --> 01:49:11,468
One down, two to go.

1650
01:49:11,553 --> 01:49:13,012
Okay. I'm gonna
call Moburg.

1651
01:49:13,096 --> 01:49:14,221
Okay.

1652
01:49:22,939 --> 01:49:24,565
Come on. Come on.

1653
01:49:37,954 --> 01:49:39,496
He isn't there.

1654
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:43,792
He has to be.

1655
01:49:45,628 --> 01:49:47,171
He isn't there.

1656
01:50:07,525 --> 01:50:08,859
Where have you been?
Sorry.

1657
01:50:08,943 --> 01:50:10,694
I never heard the phone.

1658
01:50:10,779 --> 01:50:11,820
How's it going?

1659
01:50:12,489 --> 01:50:14,281
Winning, man.
We're winning.

1660
01:50:14,365 --> 01:50:16,909
Is everyone there?
Is everyone there?

1661
01:50:18,161 --> 01:50:19,995
Yeah, everyone's here.

1662
01:50:20,121 --> 01:50:21,789
What about the vans?

1663
01:50:22,749 --> 01:50:24,249
What about the vans,
Moburg?

1664
01:50:24,876 --> 01:50:26,877
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, vans.

1665
01:50:29,714 --> 01:50:31,590
You hear that?

1666
01:50:31,674 --> 01:50:33,092
We're on our way.

1667
01:50:54,531 --> 01:50:56,198
What the hell
is going on?

1668
01:50:57,992 --> 01:50:59,868
He said he had the men.

1669
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,250
"All claims against
the former owners will be..."

1670
01:51:07,877 --> 01:51:10,963
"Signed on behalf
of First Maritime Bank, Miami."

1671
01:51:11,047 --> 01:51:13,173
Sanderson's pal, Mr. Green.

1672
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:18,387
Sorry, Paul.

1673
01:51:19,764 --> 01:51:21,098
I didn't know how to say.

1674
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:26,728
They... They took
all the machines out.

1675
01:51:27,939 --> 01:51:29,481
Not everything,

1676
01:51:29,566 --> 01:51:31,191
but just the parts
that matter.

1677
01:51:34,445 --> 01:51:36,071
I'll let you in.

1678
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:12,274
All I wanted
was a front page.

1679
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:15,068
Probably
for the best.

1680
01:52:15,153 --> 01:52:17,779
Probably would've
never pulled it off.

1681
01:52:21,117 --> 01:52:23,744
How much...
How much did you guys win?

1682
01:52:23,912 --> 01:52:25,704
Just under six grand.

1683
01:52:26,414 --> 01:52:28,290
Oh, yeah,
well, you...

1684
01:52:28,374 --> 01:52:30,417
At least you can
pay off the bond now.

1685
01:52:30,501 --> 01:52:32,044
Screw the bond.

1686
01:52:33,421 --> 01:52:35,088
We're out of here.

1687
01:52:36,883 --> 01:52:38,008
It's over with.

1688
01:52:38,092 --> 01:52:39,885
There's
a midnight Pan Am.

1689
01:52:39,969 --> 01:52:42,095
I'm not risking
the airport.

1690
01:52:44,974 --> 01:52:46,058
No.

1691
01:52:48,478 --> 01:52:50,395
I figure this island
owes us a boat.

1692
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:54,733
And I'm fuckin' taking
one of Sanderson's.

1693
01:52:58,279 --> 01:52:59,738
You smell it?

1694
01:53:04,577 --> 01:53:06,620
It's the smell
of bastards.

1695
01:53:09,999 --> 01:53:12,125
It's also
the smell of truth.

1696
01:53:15,838 --> 01:53:17,214
I smell ink.

1697
01:53:25,932 --> 01:53:27,599
<i>Always think</i>

1698
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:30,352
<i>About the days gone by</i>

1699
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:35,440
<i>When the childhood
I have sown</i>

1700
01:53:35,984 --> 01:53:37,776
<i>Appears in the sky</i>

1701
01:53:38,695 --> 01:53:41,863
<i>But I'm not the simple man</i>

1702
01:53:41,948 --> 01:53:44,658
<i>The boy I used to be</i>

1703
01:53:46,035 --> 01:53:49,079
<i>No, I learned
to picture life...</i>

1704
01:53:51,082 --> 01:53:53,208
I got to take the hen back.

1705
01:53:53,418 --> 01:53:54,876
<i>And I found</i>

1706
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:57,713
<i>After all the searching</i>

1707
01:53:58,673 --> 01:54:01,925
<i>Life was only
what I made it</i>

1708
01:54:02,385 --> 01:54:06,471
<i>After all the searching
for new games to play...</i>

1709
01:54:07,098 --> 01:54:09,224
Find yourself a trade wind.

1710
01:54:09,934 --> 01:54:11,935
<i>After all the searching</i>

1711
01:54:13,688 --> 01:54:17,065
<i>Life was only

1712
01:54:17,442 --> 01:54:21,903
<i>After all the searching
for a new game to play</i>

1713
01:54:24,115 --> 01:54:26,283
<i>Live my life away</i>

1714
01:54:32,749 --> 01:54:37,252
<i>Saw a dragon
shake the theater walls</i>

1715
01:54:38,463 --> 01:54:41,256
<i>While the steeple bell</i>

1716
01:54:41,758 --> 01:54:45,052
<i>Rang out in anguished calls</i>

1717
01:54:45,928 --> 01:54:48,305
<i>And I turn my eyes</i>

1718
01:54:48,473 --> 01:54:52,100
<i>To see a bird fly overhead</i>

1719
01:54:53,478 --> 01:54:56,938
<i>And I dreamt
its wings of freedom</i>

1720
01:54:57,273 --> 01:54:59,941
<i>Could be mine instead</i>

1721
01:55:00,693 --> 01:55:02,277
<i>And I found</i>

1722
01:55:02,403 --> 01:55:04,654
<i>After all the dreaming</i>

1723
01:55:06,157 --> 01:55:09,326
<i>Life was only

1724
01:55:09,994 --> 01:55:12,371

1725
01:55:12,455 --> 01:55:14,748
<i>Of new games to play</i>

1726
01:55:16,584 --> 01:55:19,044
<i>I drink my life away</i>

1727
01:55:24,592 --> 01:55:26,093
<i>Love you all</i>

1728
01:55:27,929 --> 01:55:29,638
<i>And livin' on</i>

1729
01:55:31,808 --> 01:55:34,142
<i>Livin' life the way...?</i>

1730
01:58:58,848 --> 01:59:02,392

<i>The cock was crowing</i>

<i>Beyond the sea</i>

1737
01:59:23,664 --> 01:59:29,210
<i>I long to see</i>

1738
01:59:29,337 --> 01:59:33,882
<i>If there's a page for me</i>

1739
01:59:34,967 --> 01:59:38,845

1740
01:59:40,222 --> 01:59:45,060
